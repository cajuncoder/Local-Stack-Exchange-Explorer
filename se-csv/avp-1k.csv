"How can I crop a video with ffmpeg?","137952","","<p>I have an MP4 file of a screen recording that I need to crop down. How can I accomplish this without using expensive tools like Adobe Premier or Final Cut? I prefer <code>ffmpeg</code> because I have used it before.</p>
","<p>Use the <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#crop""><code>crop</code> filter</a>:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v ""crop=out_w:out_h:x:y"" out.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Where the options are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>out_w</code> is the width of the output rectangle</li>
<li><code>out_h</code> is the height of the output rectangle</li>
<li><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> specify the top left corner of the output rectangle</li>
</ul>

<h2>Original image</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LAW6C.png"" alt=""original image""><br>
<sub>Original 320x240 image</sub></p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqW5O.png"" alt=""80x60""></p>

<p>To crop a 80&times;60 section, starting from position (200, 100):</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v ""crop=80:60:200:100"" -c:a copy out.mp4
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The audio is <a href=""http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Stream-copy"">stream copied</a> in this example, so re-encoding is avoided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IwvRw.png"" alt=""bottom right quarter""></p>

<p>To crop the bottom right quarter:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v ""crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:in_w/2:in_h/2"" -c:a copy out.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v ""crop=320/2:240/2:320/2:240/2"" -c:a copy out.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Which is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v ""crop=240:120:240:120"" -c:a copy out.mp4
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You can refer to the input image size with <code>in_w</code> and <code>in_h</code> as shown in this first example. The output width and height can also be used with <code>out_w</code> and <code>out_h</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example 3</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l1ILH.png"" alt=""20 pixels from the top, and 20 from the bottom""></p>

<p>Crop 20 pixels from the top, and 20 from the bottom:</p>

<pre><code> ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v ""crop=in_w:in_h-40"" -c:a copy out.mp4
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The filter will automatically center the crop if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are omitted such as in this example.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Previewing</h2>

<p>You can take a crop (heh heh) and preview it live with <code>ffplay</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ffplay -i input -vf ""crop=in_w:in_h-40""
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can experiment and adjust your cropping without the need to encode, view, repeat.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#crop""><code>crop</code> filter documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p>Default encoder for MP4 is <code>libx264</code> (H.264 video) or <code>mpeg4</code> (MPEG-4 Part 2 video) depending on your <code>ffmpeg</code> build. See <a href=""https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264"">FFmpeg Wiki: H.264 Video Encoding Guide</a> for more info.</p></li>

"How to Create a High Quality, Small File Size .mp4 from .mov","101193","","<p>Recently, I helped a friend produce a short zombie comedy. </p>

<p>He has now asked me to add it to the film's website as a digital download. I'm not having issues with the digital download. My issue is how to create a high-quality file (preferably .mp4) with a small file size.</p>

<p>I currently have a copy of the film in .mov (created in Final Cut). The .mov file is 3.2GB. The film is 29:52 in running time.</p>

<p>From other experiences, I know a 30 minute high quality .mp4 can be 185mb - 250mb. The problem, I can't seem to find any legit tutorials to create a high quality .mp4 file with this type of compression. The closest I have been able to get is 385mb (I believe that was with VLC, but I last converted the file a few months ago, so I'm not positive)</p>

<p>I am on a Windows 7 machine.</p>

<p>I have a wide variety of software at my disposal and would likely be able to purchase software, if needed.</p>
","<p>A really good program you can use is <a href=""http://handbrake.fr/"">Handbrake</a>. It's a very popular program among so called ""pirates"" because it's really good at getting a high quality even at tiny file sizes. And this is with good reason, because the main purpose of Handbrake is, indeed, to make the movies small with high quality. Personally I use it when I distribute my short movies on the internet, and it works like a charm. But enough talking, let's get to the settings!</p>

<p>Let's start with the beginning and go through the important settings.
On the right you have a presets panel. Choose Regular -> Normal or Regular -> High Profile.</p>

<p>Now, we start with the Picture settings.
The anamorphic setting is about the aspect ratio. So you've probably heard about the fact that in video, pixels aren't always square. So if you have widescreen footage, if you compress that to be much thinner, like an OLD SD TV, you could tell the video player to make each pixel wider than it actually is. So, you started have a 500 wide picture, you compressed it to 300, then you tell the player to make those 300 as wide as 500 again.</p>

<p>This is just a basic idea about what it is. You can just leave it at Loose with Modulus at 16. But if you want to learn more and squeeze the absolute maximum out of the file, read about it <a href=""https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/AnamorphicGuide"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Leave the cropping at Automatic, unless you want to crop.</p>

<p>Then we go over to the Video Filters. You can turn all of these off. They are made to correct bad footage, which you've probably already done in your video composing software..</p>

<p>Now, Video. These are the crucial settings. Use H.264. This is the format that gives you the highest quality compared to file size today. Quality. This is THE setting if you only want to set ONE. Set it to Avg Bitrate. This is the best one because if you have a lot of blacks in the picture (at night), you can optimize for that and get even smaller file sizes, but at other points in the movie you'll need more space, and so average is the best here. Notice that the size is in kbps which means kilo-bits-per-second. One kilo is 1000 (not 1024, that's kibibit.). One bit is 1/8 of a byte. So if you want a 10 second movie that's 1 MB, you want to enter 1 MB = (1024 * 1kB * 8bits) / 10s = 820 kbps. </p>

<p>Remember that the audio will also add up in addition to this. You just have to test some values until you get an acceptable quality that's small enough for you. If you enable 2-pass encoding, it will evaluate the movie twice, which means smaller file sizes compared to the quality, but it also means that you need more CPU (computer power) to watch it. So turn it on if you want to watch it on computers, leave it off if you want to watch it on mobile phones/tablets.</p>

<p>As for the audio, you just set it to what the output of your original file is. The sample rate of most movies is 48 kHz, but if you recorded in 44.1 kHz, set it to 44.1 kHz... As for the bit rate, 160 is acceptable, but if you have high quality mics and music, set it to 192. You can go higher than this, but as you want small file sizes, there is no need. You could also go lower depending on what size you want to end up with. But do a Preview and listen to the result until you are happy with it.</p>

<p>Then, the last thing you need to do is to tick off ""Large file size"". You need to have this on if the file is going to be larger than 4GB, but it will break compability with a lot of devices if you leave it on. Then you turn on ""Web Optimized"". It will make your movie better suited for progressive download so you can shuffle in the movie without downloading it all. But if you are planning for your users to download the whole movie as .mp4 and watch it on the computer, leave it off.</p>

<p>Now, set a file name and click Start. You can also Preview a small clip when you're testing the bitrate setting. Make sure that the extension is .mp4 and not .m4v. This isn't important, but you asked for .mp4, not .m4v. It's just the extension that is the difference anyway..</p>

<p>Hope you get your video squeezed down in size and yet keep the quality as high as possible! Good luck :)</p>

"Repeat/loop Input Video with ffmpeg?","60233","","<p>I just want to loop a mp4 video with ffmpeg and keep the current settings and codec.</p>

<p>For example if input.mp4 is 0:10 long, and I would want to loop it 4 times so output.mp4 is 0:40 long, how could I change the following command line to do that?</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mp4

<p>...but I get the error ""Option loop not found.""</p>
","<h1>Concat demuxer</h1>

<p>This allows you to loop an input without needing to re-encode.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a text file. Contents of an example text file to repeat 4 times.</p>

<pre><code>file 'input.mp4'
file 'input.mp4'

<li><p>Then run <code>ffmpeg</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy output.mp4
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h3>For Linux users</h3>

<p>This example is the same as above but you don't have to manually make <code>list.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for i in {1..4}; do printf ""file '%s'\n"" input.mp4 &gt;&gt; list.txt; done
ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy output.mp4

<p>With most commonly-used modern shells, you can even avoid the creation of the <code>list.txt</code> file entirely. For example, with bash:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f concat -i &lt;(for i in {1..4}; do printf ""file '%s'\n"" input.mp4; done) -c copy output.mp4

"How do I change frame size, preserving width (using ffmpeg)?","49798","","<p>I'm new to this StackExchange site, and to using the FFmpeg encoder. I have a video that is 720x480 (3:2) that I would like to change to 720x406 (16:9) to match the other videos I have for a site. I have tried various command combinations, including:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i myfile.mv4 -s 720x406 outfile.mp4
ffmpeg -i myfile.m4v -c copy -aspect 16:9 outfile.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>What I end up with is a video that scaled down to the specified height, but didn't preserve the width.  It ends up at 608x406 or thereabouts. I've been playing with various GUI versions of FFmpeg today, and they seem to do the same thing.</p>

<p>What would be the proper options/parameters to pass in (assuming I'll have more control via the command line) to achieve the desired frame size?</p>
","<p>using the scale filter will do it, but there is a bit more to it.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=720x406 output.mov 
</code></pre>

<p>will create a movie with the required pixel dimensions, but if you look at the output you'll find that it adds information into the metadata so that it will play back at the same aspect ratio as the original, by using non-square pixels. So if you want to stretch the movie anamorphically to a new aspect ratio you need to manually set the pixel aspect ratio, called the SAR for ""Sample Aspect Ratio"", thus for square pixels use:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=720x406,setsar=1:1 output.mov
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you can set the display aspect ratio to whatever you want, thus:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=720x406,setdar=16:9 output.mov
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm doing with the -vf command and the x=y,z=a expressions that follow is creating a chain of <a href=""http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html"">filters</a>. Filters can be quite complex, but in the most simple usage they take the form <code>effect=parameter,nexteffect=anotherparameter</code>, and they get processed in the order you write them.</p>

<p>You may want to put additional commands for the codec and so on, eg <code>-c:v libx264</code> to use the x264 mp4 encoder, and something like <code>-crf 20</code> to set the constant rate factor to 20 (usually a pretty good compromise between size and quality). So, a reasonably complete command would look like:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=720x406,setdar=16:9 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -profile:v main -crf 20 output.mov
</code></pre>

<p>Main profile is good for device compatibility, the <code>slow</code> preset for the libx264 encoder is a pretty good balance of speed and quality, so this is a good general web-encoding workhorse. You can make it faster by using <code>fast</code> or <code>veryfast</code> or slower with <code>veryslow</code> and <code>placebo</code> will make it ever so slightly better than <code>veryslow</code> at the expense of a lot more processing time (hence the name).</p>

<p>BTW <strong>Don't use -c copy</strong>, that means just copy the video and audio streams without doing anything to them <strong>at all</strong>, so nothing you do in terms of scale, codec, bitrate etc will have any effect.</p>

The minimum I want is to be able to obtain a 316 x 562 video containing just the cropped section. The best I could obtain is a 632 x 1124 (or any other proportional scale) video on output.</p>
","<p>I would probably approach it by first measuring the size of the area that you want to crop to.  This can be done by exporting a frame of the image and cropping in another program (like Photoshop).  </p>

<p>I would then create a sequence based on the other settings of the video, but alter the resolution of the sequence to be that of the portion of the video you want.  </p>

<p>After that, you should be able to bring in the video to the sequence.  By default, it will be come in at 100% of it's size.  It may not be perfectly centered in your frame though, so use the Motion settings under the effects control to position the actual video portion in the center of the frame.</p>

<p>You should then simply be able to export and the outside potions will be cropped off without any scaling.</p>

<p>This may seem a bit complicated, but it is the simplest way to do it since the default behavior is to fit the sequence to the size of the original clip and cropping doesn't do anything to change the sequence size.  That's why we have to start with the correct sequence size and when we have that, no crop effect is needed as only the content we want fits in the sequence.</p>

I've found some commands already but none of them worked.
This one for example.</p>

-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a copy \
output.mp4

<p><code>overlay=25:25</code> means we want to position the image 25px to the right and 25px down, originating from the top left corner (0:0).</p>

<p><code>enable='between(t,0,20)'</code> means we want the image to show between second 0 and 20.</p>

<p><code>[0:v][1:v]</code> means that we want the first video file we import with <code>-i</code>, in our case input.mp4 or how ffmpeg sees it video input file number 0, to be under video input file 1, in our case image.png. <code>:v</code> just means we want video 0 and video 1. <code>[0:a]</code> would mean we want the first imported audio track. Which would also come from input.mp4 but would point to the audio track instead of the video track in the mp4 file.</p>

<p>If you want a certain image quality/settings and not the settings ffmpeg chooses, add the image and or audio encoding options you want to use. The default video encoder will be x264.

<p>The <code>-acodec copy</code> / <code>-c:a copy</code> that you have in your command f.e. would simply re-use the audio from the source file. Though you can't do that with the video of course (in this case), that has to be transcoded because we are creating a new video source.</p>

<p>If you want to transcode audio, remove the <code>-c:a copy</code> part. You may have to explicitly specify an encoder, e.g. <code>-c:a aac -strict experimental</code>.

"Why processor is ""better"" for encoding than GPU?","32086","","<p>I was reading this <a href=""https://ericolon.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/the-secrets-of-yify-and-high-quality-and-small-file-sizes-are-not-so-secret-after-all-encoding-high-quality-low-bitrate-videos-in-handbrake-for-any-device/"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a> and I saw that a CPU is better for video compression than a GPU.</p>

<p>The article only says that happens because the processor can handle more complex algorithms than the GPU, but I want a more technical explanation, I did some search's on internet but I didn't find anything.</p>

<p>So, anyone know to explain or link a site to I had a more deep explanation of this?</p>
","<p>The article you linked is not very good.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normally, single pass bitrate encodings convert your bitrate into a RF
  value with a maximum bitrate limit and takes it from there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x264's one-pass ABR ratecontrol is not implemented as CRF + limit.  He's right that 2pass is by far the best way to hit a target bitrate, though.</p>

<p>And he apparently doesn't realize that he could start x264 with threads=3 or something, to leave some CPU time free for other tasks.  Or set x264's priority to verylow, so it only gets CPU time that no other task wants.</p>

<p>He also mixes up threads=1 with using CUDA, or something.  No wonder you have questions, because that article has a TERRIBLE explanation.  The whole article basically boils down to: use <code>x264 --preset veryslow --tune film --crf 26 in.m2ts --out out.mkv</code>, or maybe use some light filtering with an input AviSynth script.  He actually recommends ""placebo"".  That's hilarious.  I've never seen a pirated file encoded with placebo.  (you can tell from <code>me=esa</code> or <code>me=tesa</code>, instead of <code>me=umh</code> for all the good quality presets, right up to <code>veryslow</code>.</p>

<p>He also doesn't mention using 10bit color depth.  Slower to encode and decode, but even after downconverting back to 8bit, you get better 8-bit SSIM.  Having more precision for motion vectors apparently helps.  Also, not having to round off to exactly a whole 8 bit value helps.  You can think of 8-bit per component as a speed-hack; quantizing in the frequency-domain and then compressing that with CABAC means that higher bit-depth coefficients don't have to take more space.</p>

<p>(BTW, h.265 gets less benefit from 10-bit encodes for 8-bit video because it already has more precision for motion vectors.  If there is a benefit to using 10-bit x265 for 8-bit video inputs, it's smaller than with x264.  So it's less likely that the speed penalty will be worth it.)</p>

<h2>To answer your actual question:</h2>

<p>edit: doom9 is up again now, so I'll tidy up the link.  Go to it for proper quoting of who said what.</p>

<p><a href=""http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1135399#post1135399"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1135399#post1135399</a></p>

<p>google only caches the stupid print version which doesn't properly show the quoting.  I'm not quite sure which parts of these messages are quotes, and which are attributed to the person themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Highly irregular branching patterns (skip modes) and bit manipulation (quantization/entropy coding) don't suit present GPUs. IMO the only really good application at the moment are full search ME algorithms, in the end though accelerated full search is still slow even if it's faster than on the CPU.<br>
    -- MfA</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Actually, basically everything can be reasonably done on the GPU except CABAC (which could be done, it just couldn't be parallelized).</p>
  
  <p>x264 CUDA will implement a fullpel and subpel ME algorithm initially; later on we could do something like RDO with a bit-cost approximation instead of CABAC. </p>

  <p>Wrong, CUDA supports integer math.</p>
  
  <p>-- Dark Shikari</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dark Shikari is the x264 maintainer, and developer of most of the features since 2007 or so.</p>

<p>AFAIK, this CUDA project didn't pan out.  There is support for using OpenCL to offload some work from the lookahead thread (quick I/P/B decision, not a high quality final encode of the frame).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My understanding</strong> is that the search space for video encoding is SO big that smart heuristics for early-termination of search paths on CPUs beat the brute-force GPUs bring to the table, at least for high quality encoding.  It's only compared to <code>-preset ultrafast</code> where you might reasonably choose HW encoding over x264, esp. if you have a slow CPU (like laptop with dual core and no hyperthreading).  On a fast CPU (i7 quad core with hyperthreading), x264 <code>superfast</code> is probably going to be as fast, and look better (at the same bitrate).</p>

<p>If you're making an encode where rate-distortion (quality per file size) matters at all, you should use x264 <code>-preset medium</code> or slower.  If you're archiving something, spending a bit more CPU time now will save bytes for as long as you're keeping that file around.</p>

<p>side note, if you ever see messages from deadrats on a video forum, it's not going to be helpful.  He's been wrong about most stuff he's talking about in every thread I've ever seen.  His posts turned up in a couple threads I googled about x264 GPU encoding.  Apparently he doesn't understand why it isn't easy, and has posted several times to tell the x264 developers why they're dumb...</p>

"How to force Adobe Media Encoder to use 100% CPU and memory?","31859","","<p>On my machine, Adobe Media Encoder is very slow. It takes 12 hours to render 4 minutes of 1080p video for YouTube (the video is based on Adobe After Effects project with an original MOV file and four effects: curves, remove grain, unsharp mask and hue/saturation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y0CVN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I noticed that it doesn't use all the memory available, nor does it try to use as much CPU as possible. Here's the actual usage during the encoding process:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zac98.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEpr2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is there a way to speed up the encoding process by convincing the application to use all CPU and all memory available?</p>

<p><s>As a side note, is it expected to be <em>that</em> slow? I can't possibly imagine movie making companies using it to encode a movie which usually is slightly longer than 4 minutes and has slightly more than four basic effects, even with a whole data center.</s> Removing ""remove grain"" effect speeds up the encoding from 12 hours to 3:30.</p>
","<p>There might not be a way.  Based on your description of the problem, it sounds like the processing is the slow part.  While the video encoder itself is able to do multi-threaded processing, the image processing you are doing may not be able to.  By default, Premiere has always done as much parallel processing as possible for me and I frequently see it hit 99% CPU usage on my hyper-threaded quad core desktop.</p>

<p>The problem is most likely that some of your effects require the result of the previous frame to begin processing on the next frame.  If this is the case, there isn't an easy way to break it down across multiple threads and that would make it impossible to hit 100% CPU usage on a multi-core computer.</p>

<p>Similarly, RAM wouldn't be expected to cap on encoding as it is a stream operation.  There are some things that may need to be tracked over time, but for the most part, it is a stream operation with data going out as fast as it comes in, so there isn't much accumulation of data.</p>

<p>There are two main things that can improve the performance.  The first is GPU processing.  General purpose CPUs aren't really ideal for many audio/video processing tasks.  They are designed for doing a wide variety of general purpose operations, but aren't super efficient at basic operations.  GPUs, on the other hand, are designed for doing simple operations very quickly.  They can often reduce video processing tasks quite a bit.</p>

<p>A further improvement can be found in purpose built hardware.  There are professional cards designed specifically for processing video and provide real time processing and encoding of video.  These are often included in high end professional video editing workstations, but the price can be quite high.  It isn't unheard of for a professional video editing workstation to be able to get up in the $15,000 to $20,000 range or even higher, just for hardware.  They can go for a lot less if you don't mind waiting for renders (I work on a $2,350 system for my video work) but they can also get very high.</p>

"Encode settings for HTML5 background video","31682","","<p>I want to create a website with a HTML5 video background. </p>

<p>I have a short 1080p mp4 clip that I want to use (20s). I intend to run the video in a letterbox format (5:2 ish), full screen behind the page content (for an example see Paypal's website: <a href=""https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/home"">https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/home</a>)</p>

<p>What would the best export settings in Premiere CC for this purpose?</p>
","<p>You should export multiple versions to accommodate for different browsers. With HTML5, you can offer different versions of the video and the browser will automatically pick the first one that's supported. For example, take a look at the source code of the paypal website you refered to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;video autoplay=""autoplay"" muted=""muted"" poster=""none""&gt;
    &lt;source src=""https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/wright/videos/send-money.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""&gt;
    &lt;source src=""https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/wright/videos/send-money.webm"" type=""video/webm""&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, they offer both a mp4 (H264 codec) and a webm version of the video. Those would be good options for you as well. </p>

<p>Furthermore, you should try to keep the videos as small as possible, so that site visitors with slow internet will also be able to watch it. For that purpose, you should export the video with 720p instead of 1080p (nobody will see the difference, especially if the video is in the background) and aim for a bitrate below 1 Mbit/s. For example, the paypal video uses a bitrate of about 700 Kbit/s. If you don't need the audio, you could export without audio or with a low audio bitrate, i.e. 96 Kbit/s.</p>

<p>You can also save the video from the website to your computer and check the codec, bitrate and other parameters e.g. with <a href=""http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo"" rel=""noreferrer"">MediaInfo</a> or similar programs.</p>

"How to record HDMI video output?","31415","","<p>How to record HDMI video, which is being sent from a notebook to a projector without interrupting it?</p>

<p>The HDMI signal shows desktop activity and/or video game gameplay on different devices that run Windows, Mac OS X or Linux.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it possible to use an HD camcorder with HDMI in and out (example device: Sony HDR PJ620)?</li>
<li>Are there devices with built-in storage or that can write to SATA, USB or SD storage?</li>
<li>Are there devices which can be connected to a second laptop which then records the video?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Hardware/Software solutions that run on/in the computer which outputs the HDMI signal are not relevant. The video-outputting computers can not be manipulated.</em></p>
","<p>I would use three pieces of hardware for this task.</p>

<ol>
<li>A recording laptop.</li>
<li>A device that allows you to input the HDMI to the recording laptop, aka, a frame grabber.</li>
<li>An HDMI spliter.</li>
</ol>

<h2>A recording laptop</h2>

<p>Any old laptop will do, really. It doesn't need super specs, like dedicated graphics, but you certainly want at least a mid-range machine. Like an Intel i5 or better, 8 Gig's RAM, fast HDD (SSD would be great, but not necessary). Software wise, anything that can see the generic devices will work. Pro software like Vegas Pro or Adobe Primere if you have it works great. There's also Wirecast and vMix if you have webcast requirements.</p>

<h2>A video frame grabber</h2>

<p>I've had pretty good success with the <a href=""http://www.epiphan.com/products/dvi2usb-3-0/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DVI2USB3.0 Frame Grabber by Epiphan</a>. Use that with a <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zvv63.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DVI to HDMI converter</a> and it will work just fine. It also allows audio capture. I especially like its very small size, solid construction, and that it's USB powered. It will work on USB 2.0, but you will get limited bandwidth in the form of limited framerates per the source resolution (I often get about 45 fps at 1024x768 on USB 2.0). It's a bit on the pricey side, but Epiphan has very good customer service. I know other options are available, but I have no experience with them. About 5 years ago I decided against Black Magic products because of the mixed reviews on Amazon, but that may have gotten better. Other items that are like $10,000 are not the kind of equipment you are looking for. I've never actually seen one of those being used for more than what a $1,000 in hardware can do. Basically, if you don't know why it costs so much, you don't need it.</p>

<h2>HDMI video splitter</h2>

<p>There are plenty available on the market (<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=hdmi%20video%20splitter&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikqYOxwLXMAhUQ12MKHW46C_8QsAQIWQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google image search</a>). They're pretty simple. They have a single HDMI input and at least two HDMI outputs, which are both exact duplicates of the input signal. Make sure you get one that is powered because the ones that aren't reduce signal strength and it often shows, especially on projectors (at least, this is true for the VGA splitters). If you intend to audio record over HDMI make sure the splitter you get can handle that.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ol>
<li>Take your source HDMI and run it to the video splitter.</li>
<li>Run an HDMI from an output on the splitter to the projector.</li>
<li>Run an HDMI from an output on the splitter to the Epiphan frame grabber via a DVI to HDMI converter.</li>
<li>Plug the Epiphan USB into the recording laptop.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Alternative, VGA-based setup</h1>

<p>I would actually recommend this setup if this is in a professional conference setting and there is a professional audio/visual crew working it. I also recommend this setup if any of the HDMI runs are farther than 30 feet. HDMI just can't push very far and VGA can easily do 100 feet.</p>

<p>If this is a professional setup and you're just hooking in to what they already have, then the projector is not yours and you don't know what to expect. Chances are very high that projector will be gathering it's feed via VGA, not HDMI (you really should call the AV company to find out though).</p>

<p>So instead of using HDMI from the source laptop, use the VGA out (if it has one) or convert it to VGA with an <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OxEt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HDMI to VGA dongle</a>. The setup is exactly the same as above except everything HDMI is VGA now, including the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zsT1F.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VGA video splitter</a> and the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0GTT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DVI to VGA adapter</a>. For audio, just plug into the recording laptop's mic input port. As a warning, you might need some kind of audio cleanup when gathering audio this way. I regularly use the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yf2OL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Whirlwind line isolator</a> and the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRJy3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dsan laptop sound port</a>.</p>

"What are the key PC specs for best editing HD videos?","29746","","<p>My wife bought a GoPro Hero3 for some simple home video: kids, holidays, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that some videos are not playing very well on our old PCs.  We want to buy a new one for video editing. As far as I understood, such a computer should have as strong of a CPU as possible and plenty of RAM. It seems that the video card also has some role, but it's not as important as CPU/RAM in general. Is this assumption correct?</p>
","<p>Dealing with HD video has two main components.  The first is the ability to decode the highly compressed video (which is computationally intensive) and then is the ability to deal with the large uncompressed data (which is bandwidth intensive).  </p>

<p>The fastest encoders/decoders use the GPU on the graphics card to improve performance as a GPU is far more capable at attacking the problems related to rendering and compression than a traditional CPU is.  So if you have one of these, then the GPU is by far the most important piece.  If you don't however, then the CPU becomes by far the most important piece as encoding/decoding on a CPU is very, very intensive.</p>

<p>As far as dealing with the uncompressed data, the relatively small compressed files will be decompressed into memory and then played out of memory, so it is important to have high speed RAM, but not necessarily the need for a lot of it for play back.  For editing on the other hand, quantity becomes a bigger factor since the more video that can be stored in memory, the smoother your editing experience will be.</p>

<p>Finally, you have the hard drives.  It is very helpful if these are quick for loading videos (particularly for editing) and also for working as scratch disk (where editing stores temporary files that don't fit in memory), however it is probably the least critical part.  This can change though if you start working with higher quality, less compressed video where the file sizes start getting larger.</p>

<p>So, to summarize, GPU is highest priority if your software can use it, otherwise CPU and then speed of memory, quantity of memory and speed of hard drive in that order.  CPU is still second most important if you do have GPU processing support.  If you don't, then GPU is of almost no importance at all.</p>

Frames Per Second: 60
Video Format: ITU H.264

<p>I'm not sure why I can't do this.  Running ""ffmpeg -formats"" listed h264 as one it could use for both input and output.</p>

<p>If anyone could point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it greatly.  Thanks.</p>

<p>PS: I'm using FFmpeg version 0.7.3-4:0.7.3-0 on Ubuntu 11.10.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I've found a solution looking at the use of presets.  After looking for information about presets, I found the following tutorial discussing them:</p>

<p><a href=""http://juliensimon.blogspot.com/2009/01/howto-ffmpeg-x264-presets.html"">http://juliensimon.blogspot.com/2009/01/howto-ffmpeg-x264-presets.html</a></p>

<p>I just needed to specify the codec and the proper preset setting like so:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i highres.avi -r 30 -s 960x540 -vcodec libx264 -vpre medium lowerresforceh264vpremedium.avi
</code></pre>

<p>I still have some tweaking to do, but this is basically what I wanted.  Thanks.</p>
","<p>I'm trying to help. First, I don't understand why you're saying FFMPEG H.264 is not the input format? </p>

<p>I don't know the FFMPEG command line well enough (is there anyone who does? ;)  ). There's got to be a switch for multipass encoding. I know there are some built-in presets you could probably use and do almost certainly what you're aiming for. These are normally called x264 presets or x264 tune. Can you find anything like that?</p>

"How do I record a computer monitor without banding/flickering with a Canon t2i/550D?","27507","","<p>As you've probably guessed, when recording video with a computer monitor in frame I am getting banding. I'm aware that this has to do with refresh rates of the monitor vs the scan rate of the camera or something like that. I've read that most cameras have a feature to adjust for this - synchro scan, clear scan or variable scan is what I've seen it referred to as. However, I can't find anything on what or how to do this with my Canon t2i.</p>

<p>I've seen a number of videos where people do this with a t2i, so I'm sure it's possible, I'm just not sure how to set the camera up properly.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR61M54rBNk"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a video using a t2i to record a computer screen without banding.</a></p>

<p>I've noticed that I can adjust f/stop and shutter speed to get varying results when put in to Tv mode. I'm having trouble getting to a setting that has minimal/no banding and isn't either under or over exposed.</p>
","<p>While reviewing the Instruction Manual for the Canon 2Ti EOS 550 on page 127 you will find information on how to manually set the shutter time. Here is the pdf download for the manual:
<a href=""http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/9/0300003169/01/eosrt2i-eos550d-im-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/9/0300003169/01/eosrt2i-eos550d-im-en.pdf</a></p>

<p>There is wide range of 1/4000 to 1/30 of a second to work with depending on your frame rate.</p>

<p>For 50 fps or 60 fps the range is 1/4000 to 1/60.</p>

<p>For 24, 25, &amp; 30 fps the range is 1/4000 to 1/30.</p>

<p>I suggest that you try different shutter times at your preferred frame rate. I know this is not definitive, as I don't have this camera, nor have I tested this. However, the flicker you are referring to is as you suggest a synchronization issue; you are trying to have the camera capture at a rate that synchronizes with the display. Another thing you can try is change the display frame rate, if you have this option on your monitor.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

"Why is Audio and Video out of Sync during recording?","24685","","<p><em>I make a 30 second recording using a webcam on a laptop.

<li>if the interleave of the audio (the starting offset) is set correctly</li>
<li>in which sampling rate your audio was recorded.</li>

<p>Then, I would import your video file into <a href=""http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Audacity</a> (which imports only the audio, of course). </p>

<ul>
<li>On the left side of each track you find the sampling rate, too. Is this the same sampling rate as being reported by MediaInfo?</li>
<li>Does Audacity play the audio too slow, too?</li>

<p>My impression from the symptoms that you describe is that the audio is recorded at a certain sampling rate, but reported as a lower sampling rate, or not at all.</p>

<p>Try to modify your sampling rate, either in your recordings settings, or in the Windows system. On Win7, it's under <em>Control Panel->Hardware &amp; Sound->Manage Audio Devices->Recording</em>. There, select your microphone, then <em>Properties->Advanced</em>. There you can change the sampling rate.</p>

"How to use ffprobe to obtain certain information about mp4/h.264 files","23986","","<p>I am but a lowly PHP developer that has been tasked with retrieving some basic information about 100's of thousands of video files.  I've had some luck using ffmpeg extracting the <code>video bitrate</code>, <code>video width</code>, <code>video height</code>, <code>duration</code>, and <code>aspect ratio</code> from them, but with an error ratio of about 5%, this still leaves me with an enormous number of files that I don't know how to deal with.  The videos DO play,
but the massive amount of data that ffmpeg returns in has me baffled as to how parse the returned XML to find what I need with all the conditions that I seem to be encountering.  (The files are a collection from the past 15 years or so, some newly encoded, others converted years ago)</p>

<p>At any rate, I found the following use of <code>ffprobe</code> to get duration, and was hoping that someone here who understands the complexities of using ffmpeg &amp; ffprobe would be kind enough in assist me with finding the other values I need in a more straightforward way than the crazy code I'm finding myself creating to climb through the full results of ffmpeg.</p>

It mentions that Canon has a 30 minute limit.</p>

<p>I am recording HD video on a Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS point-and-shoot, and am coming up against a 10 minute limit. <a href=""http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=4680&amp;p=4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> says that there is a 60 minute limit on standard definition and 10 minute limit on high definition. With 720p a 10 minute video is about 1.5 Gb. I wanted to mention the 10 minute limit explicitly because it seems that many people talk about a 30 minute limit and so this seemed like a somewhat unique case.</p>

<p>My question is whether there is a way to extend the limit from 10 to something like 30 minutes? 10 minutes is just short for my purposes of recording my own judo tournament matches.</p>

<p>I guess it would have to be some kind of patch to the firmware. Does such a thing exist?</p>
","<p>I believe the limit is due to the <em>file size</em>, not the actual recording length.  <a href=""http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1031&amp;message=35289169"" rel=""nofollow"">This forum thread</a> seems to confirm this for the T2i/500D, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D_Mark_II"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> agrees for the 5D mkII.  Also according to these sources, the limit for both cameras is 4gb.</p>

<p>For the PowerShot cameras, the file size limit is likely much lower. For the S2, <a href=""http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1010&amp;message=13834915"" rel=""nofollow"">it appears</a> to be 1gb.</p>

<p>What all this means is that the time limit isn't a time limit, per se... but a file size limit.  So if you are able/willing to reduce the file <em>quality</em>, you may be able to extend the time limit.</p>

<p>If you can shoot in a lower quality video mode (say 480i instead of 720p), that will likely improve your recording time.  If you can reduce the frame rate, that may improve your time limit, as well.  Of course all of these things will make the video noticibly lower quality, as well.</p>

<p>If you can't get different equipment, you may be best off strategically stopping and starting the video during pauses in the action.</p>

"What is the cheapest camera I can plug external microphone to?","19345","","<p>I am working on some homemade lectures so I need good quality of sound, but unfortunately I do not have any budget so far(amateur stuff). </p>

<p>I am looking for a camera that can shoot in Full HD and can have an external microphone attached. I do not need anything further than that, though.</p>

<p>I was considering <code>SONY HDR-CX240</code> until I found out it cannot have external mic.
(What if it is a USB mic? It does have a USB slot.) So, should I quit this choice and buy a more expensive camera? Which one whould you recommend?</p>

<p>Is it possible that I record with the camera and external mic attached to my laptop at the same time?</p>
","<p>Do you own a high-end smartphone? You can plug-in pretty much any microphone and have very decent audio quality. Some Android phones even support usb mics.
So you probably need a cheap adapter for standard stereo or mono mics to work with the 3 channel type headphone+mic jacks in modern phones. Something like this: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004SP0WAQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-headsets-separate-headphone-microphone/dp/B004SP0WAQ/</a></p>

<p>It then only depends on the video quality of your phone. If that is satisfactory just get some sort of tripod adapter or other type of stand for phones and you're good to go. Definitely the cheapest solution if you already own a fitting phone.</p>

<p>If your phone is not an option I recommend you go with a webcam and USB microphone attached to your PC or Laptop. Most recording softwares have the option to choose a different audio source than your video recording device.
You can get a decent quality webcam for 20-30€ and a decent quality USB mic that can capture room audio for 15-20€.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a camera</li>
<li>Create a null object</li>
<li>Set the parent of the null object to be the camera</li>
<li>Make the null object a '3D' object</li>
<li>Use the null object's properties to zoom and move the camera around, e.g. use the 'z' position to zoom</li>
</ul>

<p>You could do this with the camera by itself, but the null object is sometimes easier to deal with. Ease in and out of the keyframes for a smooth animation. I hope this helps!</p>

","<p>This can either be an issue with OpenGL and you may want to disable it in the program settings (under ""File) to test if thats the issue. Or you may have disabled the standard infinite light that is present in every new scene until you add your first light. Add an infinite light from the lights menu and see if that gives your objects some shading.
Also try what @Bart Arondson said and look if you have the ""Use Color"" option enabled and set to black. If yes set it to ""off"".</p>

"Does Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 have a fullscreen mode?","18379","","<p>Essentially what I'm looking for is a way to make Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 go fullscreen. I do not mean the fullscreen preview of the video or fullscreen on a specific panel (like the timeline).</p>

<p>I want to get rid of the Windows taskbar and the window border. The same way that you would go fullscreen with a browser by pressing F11.</p>

<p>I'm surprised I haven't found any shortcut or any discussion online. I'm working on a 15"" laptop monitor and would like to maximize my workspace. I've tried to press F11, searched for it in the menus and the keyboard shortcut list but haven't found anything.</p>

<p>As clarified in the comments on AJ's answer below, I am looking for something like pushing F in Photoshop or Lightroom, where the workspace is otherwise the same.  For example, this is how it looks in Lightroom.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgc8V.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
","<p>I'm fairly certain there is no such mode.  It doesn't have the same kind of feature that lightroom does as the full screen video preview is really the closest in terms of being related functionality.  </p>

<p>The full screen mode is helpful in Lightroom because it allows focusing on the photo with only basic controls.  Premiere is much more complex than LR and a significant portion of screen real-estate is taken up by those controls.  If you aren't purely focusing on the video, then the amount of lost and distracting space really isn't a big issue.</p>

<p>Note that if you really need every last scrap of screen real estate though, you can adjust the task bar so that you can make it only a small line on the bottom of the screen though.  You really are not practically losing any meaningful amount of screen real-estate.</p>

<p>The only functionality is the functionality that maximizes a particular panel or full screens the preview, but you already mentioned those are not what you are looking for.  That's the closest you are going to get though.</p>

"Should you shoot flat when shooting with a DSLR?","18183","","<p>I've read a bit about how it can be useful to use a ""flat"" profile for shooting video on a DSLR which produces only compressed video. For example as described in <a href=""http://prolost.com/flat/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>. The reasoning is that most lossy compressors (like H.264) will do more compression in the darks, removing that data and making it impossible to adjust in post. (For example, if you brighten it, you'll get bright gray squares instead of whatever data was there before compression.)</p>

<p>The author of the above seems reasonable. He worked at LucasFilm and has directed many music videos and feature film VFX shots. It doesn't seem like he's suggesting some fad, but is talking from experience.</p>

<p>In the answer to [<a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/10542/post-production-workflow-vfx-before-color-correction](Post-production"">Post-production workflow: VFX before color correction?</a> workflow: VFX before color correction), this was included in the accepted answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As far as low contrast and low saturation, I would disagree rather strongly with shooting for low contrast/low saturation. This is how you get noisy, low quality color. Your camera has a limited number of colors it can describe, if you ignore a large portion of that color space, then you can't describe as many colors and the resolution of your color after boosting the saturation and contrast will be very greatly reduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These sound contradictory to me, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Is the advice to shoot flat good advice for DSLRs with lossy compression or not?</p>
","<p>Neither viewpoint is wrong, they rather have different advantages.  It is a question of dynamic range vs compression noise.  My answer on the previous question may have been a little too strongly from my particular camp of thought (I was not aware of the compression related dark color issues at the time as I shoot high bit rate video primarily, which makes it much less of an issue.)</p>

<p>If you are shooting non-raw and using a flat color space, you have fewer values to represent the range of colors in your shot.  You can get more detail on the brightest and darkest spots since they are exposed as mid-range colors, but you lose the depth of color since you have to artificially expand it later in post.  I'm not sure what I was thinking with the noisy bit, probably thinking about the loss of color detail from reducing your color space based on the surrounding explanation, but noise was a poor choice of term for that.  (I have updated accordingly.)</p>

<p>The flip side of that is to get it mostly right in camera.  You have to be careful about your black point and make sure that you actually have sufficient detail in the shadows, but utilizing the full color space allows for far more colors to be described, even if it offers less ability to adjust after the fact.</p>

<p>It is all a question of recovery.  When you deal with RAW, you have detail going all the way down to the darkest and all the way up to the brightest point from which you can work to pull out any details that the camera captured.  When you are dealing with an encoded video though, you are limited to whatever is displayed.  Using flat allows more recovery since you capture beyond the black and white point of the final video (and does reduce sensor noise in the darks since they are actually exposed as mid-tones) but it means much less color detail to work with.</p>

<p>I prefer making full use of my color space and controlling shooting, others prefer to have extra control at the cost of color depth.  Neither is a wrong choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When importing an image sequence, <code>-i</code> also supports expanding shell-like wildcard patterns (globbing) internally. To lower the chance of interfering with your actual file names and the shell's glob expansion, you are required to activate glob meta characters by prefixing them with a single <code>%</code> character, like in <code>foo-%*.jpeg</code>, <code>foo-%?%?%?.jpeg</code> or <code>foo-00%[234%]%*.jpeg</code>.</p>

","<p><strike>The default settings for ffmpeg are very low quality, and since you don't specify any codec or quality parameters it's just using the defaults (I don't know why the devs don't fix that because it generates a lot of questions on forums everywhere).</strike> </p>

<p><strong><em>Edit</strong>: the defaults are now quite sane. With a recent build of ffmpeg you don't need to specify anything more than input and output files to achieve good useable results. You can, of course tweak to your heart's desire.</em></p>

<p>Try adding <code>-c:v libx264 -crf 20 -preset slow</code> to the command. </p>

<ul>
<li><code>-c:v libx264</code> tells it to use the libx264 encoder, </li>
<li><code>crf 20</code> uses the Constant Rate Factor quantiser (which paradoxially means variable bit rate, but constant quality) with a value of 20 (pretty good quality; lower is better quality / larger files, higher is crappier / smaller),</li>
<li>the <code>slow</code> preset is a shortcut for a bunch of encoder settings that means it puts a bit more effort into it than the default (medium). </li>
</ul>

<p>You can tweak these settings, see the <a href=""https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">h.264 encoding guide</a> for instructions on what knobs to twiddle.</p>

"How does Apple Motion compare to Adobe After Effects?","17780","","<p>I am looking at Apple Motion and Adobe After Effects. How to they compare to one another? What are the pros and cons of each?</p>
","<p>After Effects is much more powerful than Motion when you get into advanced stuff like scripting your animations.  After Effects is much more tolerant to large projects, and you can ""precomp"" different sequences (which is difficult to explain without you actually seeing it; basically allows you to put one timeline inside of another or reuse a specific portion of your project over and over, if that makes any sense).  Apple Motion only allows one timeline per project, you cannot nest sequences inside one another without rendering out a QuickTime movie.</p>

<p>Apple Motion does however boast that it gives you ""realtime previews"" which plays your animation instantly, whereas After Effects typically requires you to render a RAM preview in order to see your animation in realtime.  Of course this depends on the speed of your computer and the complexity of your project, so this is really only handy for simple projects.</p>

<p>When you want to start doing really custom effects like particle systems and other physics based or true 3D compositing, your options are very limited in Motion.  After Effects has a whole range of plugins available online that will do almost anything you can think of.  The <a href=""http://www.trapcode.com/"">Trapcode</a> plugins are very well-built and very popular.  There are very few plugins for Motion compared to After Effects.</p>

<p>I've used both for years, and Apple Motion seems to crash more often than After Effects, especially as your projects get more complex (just personal experience, maybe this has improved as of version 5).</p>

<p>I actually started animating for the first time in Apple Motion, and I agree that the learning curve isn't quite as steep as After Effects (although that was Motion 2.0 and 3.0, and now they're at version 5.0).  Once I mastered Motion and dove into After Effects, I haven't looked back.  I recently fired up Motion for the first time in a few years and I was struggling to get it to do what I wanted to do, my brain has just been trained to <strong>think</strong> like After Effects.  Even though at first I was more productive in Motion than After Effects (because After Effects is more complex), I have completely reversed and now I feel like I'm a speed machine in After Effects and Motion is now useless to me.</p>

<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> if you're serious about getting a professional tool to do professional work, save up to get After Effects.  If you're just a hobbyist that wants to dabble in animation, get Apple Motion (now that it's on the Mac App Store the price has come down considerably).</p>

<p>Hope this answers most of your questions!  If you have any other specific ones, let me know and I'll be happy to talk.</p>

","<h1>Using the latest <code>ffmpeg</code></h1>

<p>General users should always use <code>ffmpeg</code> from the current git master branch (the latest code available):</p>

<ul>
<li>When encountering an issue the first thing to do is check to see if you are using a build from git master.</li>
<li>It is considered stable.</li>
<li>It will have more bug fixes and features.</li>
<li><a href=""http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=shortlog"">FFmpeg development is very active</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to get support from official help resources you must use git master.</li>
<li>Releases are for distributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/download.html"">FFmpeg Download</a> page for various options, or refer to <a href=""https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide"">FFmpeg Wiki: Compile Guides</a>.</p>

<h2>Other stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In your command with <code>drawbox</code> you can <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Stream-copy"">steam copy</a> the audio with <code>-c:a copy</code> instead of re-encoding it.</p></li>

"Professional text animation software","17690","","<p>In addition to Adobe Flash, what other tools people usually use to make text animations.<br>
By text animation I mean, like animations that has a narration and word or letters from the narration dance on the screen, change in size and color, bump to each other, fall down or fly away.<br>
I am looking for something that professionals would use, some like what is used to produce this video: <div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfRVCaA5o18?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div> </p>
","<p>All of the pro video editors have a means of animating titles to some degree, some are better than others. I am only experienced with Sony Vegas Pro 10, but I have seen my colleagues use Adobe Premiere with Adobe After Effects to create some mind blowing 'dancing' titles. Vegas has plugins available to boost their basic package but the basic package can do most if not all the effects you have in your example while Adobe's Premiere and After Effects might be able to take this to another level as in more 3d attributes.</p>

<p>I recommend a pro video editor over power point as you have tons of flexibility (avi, mov, mp4, m2t, etc) vs. only a ppt file. However, there are many products available to convert ppt files into video such as this free version I just found:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.effectmatrix.com/PowerPoint-Video-Converter/Free-PowerPoint-Video-Converter.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.effectmatrix.com/PowerPoint-Video-Converter/Free-PowerPoint-Video-Converter.htm</a></p>

<p>Caution: I have never tried this product so I am uncertain on quality.</p>

<p>I should mention that animating titles is not the only thing going on in your example, there is some degree of track motion control and pan/crop as well not to mention compositing.</p>

<p>If you are seriously looking for a pro product, I would seek advice from professionals that already use these products in conjunction with trying out the trail versions if available. I do know that Sony Vegas Pro 11 is available for free download for a 30 day trail. Most of these products will cost between $500 and $2500 and the learning curve can be heavy.</p>

"How to detect and extract words from audio/video stream online in a webpage itself?","17160","","<p>I have a video (or audio, I think it is not important) stream/file which does not contain subtitles. But it has clean english speech. Is it possible to detect and extract words from it. I don't need 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>Are there some services or applications for this case? Maybe some services gives API for this? Any ideas are welcome.</p>
","<p>If you work on a regular basis with the ""owner"" of the voice I can recommend Nuance's <a href=""http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Dragon</a> it offers very accurate speech to text with very few errors but it needs some ""calibration"" to a specific voice.</p>

<p>So if you can get your actor/narrator to read the calibration text you will have an easy time making transcripts and subtitles (though subs will require manual timing afterwards).
Nuance also offers a <a href=""http://www.nuance.com/for-developers/dragon/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">developer SDK/API</a> if you need that.</p>

<p>However it will not help you in the case of interviews with random people on the street.</p>

<p>An alternative that doesn't need calibration and is also free to use is the Google Voice to Text service. There is a nice un-offical ""API"" for that on <a href=""https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2"" rel=""nofollow"">Github</a>.</p>

<p>It will give you usable results in most cases and its fairly easy to use if you know a bit about programming and can use a command line.
Though be aware that I do not know the legal status of that, I'm not sure if that service is allowed to be used for commercial use. You might want to read into the <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Terms of Service</a> for that, they unified that about a year ago so it should apply for the Voice to Text service as well. Also a downside, it only accepts 15 seconds snippets but if you want to automate this anyway you can just split your audio file up with FFmpeg and upload them at the same time.</p>

<p>There is also another commercial alternative called <a href=""https://www.ispeech.org/developers"" rel=""nofollow"">iSpeech</a> which works on a pay per use model.</p>

<p>Also there is a built-in speech recognition in Adobe Premiere which should be the easiest way to make subitles as it integrates into the complete video workflow and allows almost automatic adjustment of the timing. A nice how-to can be found <a href=""http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/speech-analysis-premiere-pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

"ffmpeg drawtext filter - create transparent background with text","16594","","<p>I am currently working with the <code>drawtext</code> filter.

<p>Question is:</p>

<p>Can I fix this problems (I suppose stream and keyframes related) with ffmpeg and maybe in a -c copy fashion so I haven't to recompress everything?</p>

","<p>If parts of the file reside on physically bad sectors, or for whatever reason, the OS cannot serve the whole file to FFmpeg, then naturally FFmpeg can't do anything about that. You should get a utility which can ignore those portions and write the salvageable parts to a new file, like <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ddrescue</a>.</p>

Unfortunately, the programs I've been using (Miro, FFMPEG's ogv plugin) have terrible encoding that appears extremely fuzzy.  Does anyone have recommendations for less compressed files in this format? Is it possible? Software recommendations?
Thanks.</p>
","<p>You can encode to Theora video and Vorbis audio with <code>ffmpeg</code> if it has been compiled with <code>--enable-libtheora</code> and <code>--enable-libvorbis</code>. Depending on your <code>ffmpeg</code> version the default settings may not provide good enough quality. Therefore you must add some additional parameters to enable a constant quality type of mode for the video.</p>

<h2>Theora video</h2>

<p>Adjust video quality with the <code>-qscale:v</code> (or the alias <code>-q:v</code>) option. The valid range to set video quality with libtheora is -1 to 10. A higher value is a higher quality.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> More modern alternatives such as VP8 can provide better quality at lower bitrates. See the <a href=""https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/VP8"">FFmpeg: VP8 in WebM Encoding Guide</a> for more info.</p>

<h2>Vorbis audio</h2>

<p>Adjust audio quality with the <code>-qscale:a</code> (or the alias <code>-q:a</code>) option for VBR audio. The valid range to set audio quality with libvorbis is 0 to 10. A higher value is higher quality. <a href=""http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Recommended_Ogg_Vorbis#Recommended_Encoder_Settings"">See the Recommended Vorbis Encoder Settings</a> to get an idea of what values to use. The default of <code>-q:a 3</code> will be used if you omit <code>-q:a</code> or <code>-b:a</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>ffmpeg</code> supports two Vorbis encoders: the external library libtheora (<code>-c:a libvorbis</code>) and the native Vorbis encoder (<code>-c:a vorbis -strict experimental</code>). The native encoder is experimental, does not compare well to libvorbis, and usage is not recommended.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following command will create a good quality output for both video and audio:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input -c:v libtheora -c:a libvorbis -q:v 6 -q:a 5 output.ogg
</code></pre>

"How does graphics card's memory affect video rendering performance?","14919","","<p>So, I'm asking that, since I've got a GTX650Ti 1 GB graphics, and it takes 5 minutes to render a simple 1 minute video with minimum effects. Is it normal? I've tried it both with Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere
Will the 2 GB version of GTX650Ti increase performance?</p>
","<p><strong>1)</strong> Everytime the GPU has to process something, it will load the necessary data (in that case your video frames) into the VRAM. Simple as that, the GPU cannot work with your system memory.
Though the GPU gets it's data from the system memory, so your system memory will act as a buffer and you don't need to load that much data at once into the VRAM.</p>

<p>Though programs which offer a real-time workflow will want to load as much data into the VRAM as possible. That's the reason why you can allocate a specific amount of VRAM in Adobe After Effects (not 100% sure if you can do the same in Premiere).
So every time you apply an effect in Premiere that is GPU accelerated, the GPU will have to request data into the VRAM to process the frames.</p>

<p>New versions of OpenCL and CUDA are improving the way of how the GPU will get its data and reducing the overhead caused by the CPU which will reduce the amount of VRAM needed at a time but VRAM will always be a very important factor with the current PC architecture.
Current GPUs use GDDR5 which is A LOT faster than DDR3 system memory. This is needed as the memory speed is a very important performance factor in GPU computing. Overclocking your VRAM can give you quite a performance boost in memory intensive 3D rendering applications (though probably not in Premiere).
Current <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDDR5"" rel=""nofollow"">GDDR5</a> based GPUs like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units#GeForce_700_Series"" rel=""nofollow"">GTX 780 Ti</a> are capable of more than 300 GB/s (336 GB/s in this case). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddr3"" rel=""nofollow"">DDR3</a>-2133 is substantially slower with a peak bandwidth of 16,66 GB/s per module. Also 2133 is rather uncommon in OEM PCs, DDR3-1600 and 1300 is more common.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> So you will benefit from a large amount of VRAM everytime you work with very high resolution images or many videos at once aswell as with high-frame rate footage. Premieres rendering engine is utilizing the GPU for both the preview aswell as the final rendering if you chose so.</p>

<p>In practice I'd say it's nonsense to have more than 2GB of VRAM for Premiere unless you work with other applications at the same time that utilize the GPU. Processing bitmaps doesn't require all that much data at once unless you work with crazy resolutions like 8k or 16k, the processing capability of your GPU will be the bottleneck before your VRAM.</p>

<p>Thats my opinion based on what I know about the Premiere video engine and GP-GPU. Premiere might do some other stuff in the background that requires more VRAM. So if you have a very specific use case I'd rather make a benchmark or search for one before making a purchase decision. If you just want to make a general guess this information should help you quite well to make a decision.</p>

"Why does the color red always appear pixelated on TV and videos on the PC?","14829","","<p>I hope this isn't off-topic.  While technically about video production, it's not about a problem I am having.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed on TV how the color red is always noticeably pixelated?  It's the same why while watching video on the computer, as well, be it a Blu-ray, DVD, a video playing directly from disk, or a video being streamed from the internet.  No other other that I know of looks pixelated like the color red.  I've noticed this since as far back as I can remember starting with DVD.  I haven't watched any VHS tapes for many, many years, so I can't say whether or not this pixelation occurs with tapes, but it'd make sense to think that it wouldn't since those are analog.</p>

<p>BTW, I've searched for this online and found a lot of people asking the same questions, but I have yet to see an actual answer.</p>

<p>Here's an example of red pixelation that I just happened to come across on YouTube, although the same thing occurs even on TV broadcasts.  Although you can still see it at actual size, zooming in lets you see how pixelated the color red is in comparison to the rest of the colors which really aren't pixelated at all.  I strongly doubt that this is merely a visual anomaly.  Instead, I believe it has to do with how the color red is processed during encoding.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYXz9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>It's not an illusion - it's called chroma subsampling.</p>

<p>Most video codecs do not represent colour in full resolution. This allows for more efficient ""lossy"" compression because it takes advantage of the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness (""luma"") than colour (""chroma""). Most lossy codecs lower the chroma resolution to half or one quarter of the overall resolution, so you may only get one pixel's worth of colour for every four pixels of brightness. This dramatically decreases the amount of data needed, with only a small loss of apparent quality.</p>

<p>It's slightly more complicated though: the brightness is actually made up of the sum of the three colour components Red, Green and Blue. And they're not encoded as RGB, that would be require more bandwidth, they're encoded as YUV. Y corresponds roughly to the green component, and the U and V are Y minus the red component and Y minus the blue component (a gross approximation, actually - if you want the whole formula look <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuv#Converting_between_Y.27UV_and_RGB"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>In most codecs the U and V components are sampled at a lower resolution than the Y. this is expressed in the three-way ratio you often see if you hang around video forums too much, e.g. 4:2:2 or 4:2:0. For a two row rectangle of pixels the numbers represent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""width of sample region (Y samples)"":""UV samples in the first
  row"":""additional UV samples in the second row""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A common example of this notation is in the codec name ""proRes422"" the 422 part of the name comes from 4:2:2 meaning for every a 4x2 rectangle there will be 4 Y samples in each row 2 UV samples in the first row (half the horizontal resolution) and 2 UV samples in the second row. So proRes422 has half the chroma resolution of the luma.</p>

<p>On the internet and on telly you're most likely seeing everything in a 4:2:0 codec. In every 4x2 rectangle of picture there are only two UV samples (the 0 means that there are no additional samples on the second row). So the colour part of the image is composed of chunks 2x2 pixels in size, in other words, one quarter the resolution.</p>

<p>This means the red channel on its own has one quarter the resolution of the overall picture. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> the red looks pixelated - because it actually <em>is</em>.</p>

"How is ""definition"" (SD, HD, UHD) actually defined?","14386","","<p>OK, so at first it might sound like a stupid question but I'm trying to get my head around all these definitions...</p>

<p>It seems that they don't have a specific resolution, but they do at the same time. It's as they have their own resolution but also are part of a group of resolutions.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution#Televisions"">Wiki says:</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>HD</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>720i</li>
<li>1080i</li>
<li>1080p</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>UHD</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2160p</li>
<li>4320p</li>
<li>8640p</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>But generally we say that 1080i is HD and 1080p is FULLHD.</p>

<p>UHD has resolution 3840 x 2160 and 4K is 4096 x 2160 but 4K is UHD. Same vertical resolution (2160) but different aspect ratio, making the horizontal slightly longer by 256 pixels. And it also includes 8K...</p>

<p>Is UHD a resolution, a group of resolutions or both? If it's both, why?</p>
","<p>The problem is that definitions such as HD, UHD and 4k etc. are partly hype. Marketers for AV equipment like to be rather elastic with the truth, hence the rather rubbery definitions. They're not standards such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_television_systems#ATSC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ATSC</a> or DVB, or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graphic display resolutions</a> such as VGA, WXGA etc., they're really just buzzwords.</p>

<p>There are other complications - like the different broadcast standards for SD — so that SD PAL is 576 visible lines and SD NTSC is 480 lines — or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_aspect_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-square pixels</a> in digital video meaning that even a 16:9 HD 1080p image can be either 1440x1080 or 1920x1080*. So it's pretty understandable that you're confused.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, the general consensus is that:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SD</strong> refers to 576i / 480i (with the unusual <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced-definition_television"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>EDTV</strong></a> variant being 576p and 480p). Display resolution is 768 × 576 PAL or 720 × 534 NTSC, often the actual pixel resolution is reduced, as in the case of DV: 720 × 576 PAL or 720 × 480 NTSC, with non-square pixels</li>
<li><strong>HD</strong> refers to 720p and 1080i / 1080p. The display resolution is 1280 × 720 or 1920 × 1080, but sometimes the horizontal pixel resolution is reduced, e.g. HDV which is 1440 × 1080 with non-square pixels. You could also say that resolutions higher than this are also High Definition. So in one sense it's anything that isn't standard definition. Note that there is no 720i.</li>
<li><strong>Full HD</strong> or <strong>FHD</strong> means the 1080 flavour of HD (either interlaced or progressive)</li>
<li><strong>2K</strong> describes the Digital Cinema Initiative resolution of 2048 × 1080, this resolution is based on the historical resolution of scanned super 35mm film. As with 4K it is a little slippery, and can sometimes be used to describe FHD. As the wikipedia article states it describes content <em>""having horizontal resolution <strong>on the order of</strong> 2,000 pixels""</em>. So in other words: near enough is good enough.</li>
<li><strong>QHD</strong> or <strong>Quad HD</strong> - 2560 × 1440 is a whacky one, it's twice the resolution of 720p. The ""quad"" refers to there being four times the pixels of a 720p frame. Not to be confused with QFHD - see below.</li>
<li><strong>UHD</strong> refers to 3840 × 2160, and like HD also sometimes to higher resolutions like <strong>4K</strong> and <strong>UHD 8K</strong></li>
<li><strong>QFHD</strong> is 3840 x 2160 ""Quad Full HD"", the quad referring to the fact that it has four times the pixels of a FHD frame, which sounds better than saying it has twice the horizontal and vertical resolution. QFHD = UHD</li>
<li><strong>UHD 4K</strong> - 3840 × 2160, is double the HD 1080 frame size, and is also sometimes called <strong>4K</strong>, even though the horizontal resolution is less than 4000 pixels. UHD 4K = UHD</li>
<li><strong>UHD 8K</strong> or <strong>FUHD</strong> is 7680 × 4320. I'm guessing that as the FUHD sets hit the shops they'll be called ""8K"" by the salespeople.</li>
<li><strong>4K</strong> usually refers to Digital Cinema Initiatives 4K which is 4096 × 2160 but the term is sometimes used to refer to <strong>UHD 4K</strong></li>
<li>Similarly <strong>8K</strong> should properly refer to 8192 × 4320 but is also applied to <strong>FUHD</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there are cameras such as the Red cameras that shoot in-between resolutions such as 3K, 5K and 6K. But that's just for production, the finished media will usually be cropped / scaled to a more standard resolution for display or broadcast.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> If you're trying to define anything in technical terms and want to be unambiguous just give the pixel dimensions; terms like HD, UHD etc are really <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FUD</a>. They're more for marketing than anything else.</p>

Pause the video at points where there is quick motion, and step forward one frame at a time.  Make sure the video is displayed at %100 zoom.

<p>Additionally, as user1118321 pointed out, since 4k is not an even multiple of 1080p, you would have some amount of artifacts from the downsampling that your computer would have to do to fit the 4k signal to a 1080p display.  It might be worth it if you have a higher than 1080p display but less than 4k since the loss from downscaling will likely be offset by the extra detail your monitor can display, but for a 1080p display, it is hands down best to use a 1080p stream unless the 4k uses enough of a higher bandwidth to have less artifacts in the stream even after downscaling (which is highly unlikely on any well configured stream).</p>

"Converting a Adobe Premiere CS6 project to a CS5 one","11726","","<p>I run the old CS 5 version of Adobe Premiere but my friend just got the newer CS 6 version.</p>

<p>Now she's handing over a project on to me. So I have to turn her project files into files I can continue working in.</p>

<p>The problem is that Premiere's own built-in conversion process did not quite do it. I ended up with a faulty project where the project window is actually blank, even though the files are clearly there (they show up in the timeline). Also, it is still possible to play back the timeline - it's just that I can't actually do much editing with the project window being as it is.</p>

<p>This leads me to my question: Is there a better and simpler way to do the conversion from a CS 6 file to a CS 5 one yet? Are there any good workarounds I have not thought of (that aren't ""render every single track individually and go from there"") or anything else I can do?</p>

"How do I set up and use ffmpeg in Windows?","11690","","<p>I understand that ffmpeg is a powerful tool for video file conversions. I see online in many places people suggesting it for solutions or getting help in how to use it. The problem is I don't even know how to set it up or use it at all. These posts I'm talking about usually take the form ""Use ffmpeg [complicated and unreadable line of code]."" I'm not really a programmer, but I can do few things, so I think I can figure it out, if I just had a bit of direction.</p>

<p>How do I set up and use ffmpeg in Windows?</p>
","<p>ffmpeg is indeed a powerful video encoder/decoder. It operates in the command line, as opposed to using a GUI. Command line is that black window you find by clicking [windows+r] and typing <code>cmd</code> then hitting enter. This is also called ""command prompt"". Once setup you enter ffmpeg commands in one of these windows to use it.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps to ""install"" and use it:</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href=""https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the ffmpeg download site</a> and download the zip file that best fits you computer's specs. Choose ""static"" linking and the ""nightly git"" version for the most current usability.</li>
<li>Create a folder on your computer to uppack the zip file. This folder will be your ""installation"" folder. I chose <code>C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\</code>. This is a good idea because you will treat this like a regular program. Unpack the zip file into this folder.</li>
<li>The folder should now contain a number of other folders, including one titled <code>bin</code> where <code>ffmpeg.exe</code> is saved. We're not done yet. Double clicking that file does nothing. Remember, this is a command line program. It runs in <code>cmd</code>.</li>
<li>Before you can use <code>ffmpeg.exe</code> in <code>cmd</code> you have to tell your computer where it can find it. You need to add a new system path. First, right click This PC (Windows 10) or Computer (Windows 7) then click <code>Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Advanced tab &gt; Environment Variables</code>.  </li>
<li>In the Environment Variables window, click the ""Path"" row under the ""Variable"" column, then click Edit
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ig6nr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ig6nr.jpg"" alt=""Steps to add a System path to Windows""></a></li>
<li>The ""Edit environment variable"" window looks different for Windows 10 and 7. In Windows 10 click New then paste the path to the folder that you created earlier where <code>ffmpeg.exe</code> is saved. For this example, that is <code>C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin\</code>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1FO8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1FO8.jpg"" alt=""Add new system path Windows 10]""></a>
In Windows 7 all the variables are listed in a single string, separated by a semicolon. Simply go the the end of the string, type a semicolon (<code>;</code>), then paste in the path.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ox5J8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ox5J8.jpg"" alt=""Add new system path Windows 7""></a></li>
<li>Click Ok on all the windows we just opened up.</li>
</ol>

<p>ffmpeg is now ""installed"". The Command Prompt will now recognize ffmpeg commands and will attempt to run them.</p>

<h1>Updating ffmpeg</h1>

<p>To update ffmpeg, just revisit the download page in step 1 above and download the zip file. Unpack the files and copy them over the old files in the folder you created in step 2.</p>

<h1>Using ffmpeg</h1>

<p>Using ffmpeg requires that you open a command prompt window, then type ffmpeg specific commands. Here is a typical ffmpeg command:</p>

<pre><code> ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -ar 44100 -ac 1 -b:a 32k -f mp3 audio.mp3
</code></pre>

<p>This command has four parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>ffmpeg</code> - This command tells cmd that we want to run ffmpeg commands. cmd will first look for <code>ffmpeg.exe</code> in one of the folders from step 6 in the Installation section. If it is found, it will attempt to run the command.</li>
<li><code>-i video.mp4</code> - This is an input file. We are going to be doing work on this file.</li>
<li><code>-vn -ar 44100 -ac 1 -b:a 32k -f mp3</code> - These are the ""arguments"". These characters are like mini commands that specify exactly what we want to do. In this case, it is saying create an mp3 file from the input source.

<ul>
<li><code>-vn</code> - Leave out the video stream</li>
<li><code>-ar 44100</code> - Specifies audio resolution in hertz.</li>
<li><code>-ac 1</code> - Audio channels, only 1. This is effectively ""make mono"".</li>
<li><code>-b:a 32k</code> - Audio bitrate, set to 32 kbps.</li>
<li><code>-f mp3</code> - Force to MP3 conversion. Without this command, ffmpeg attempts to interpret what you want based on the extension you use in the output file name.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>audio.mp3</code>- This is the output file.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can probably guess, this short command makes an MP3 audio file from an MP4 file.</p>

<p>To run this command, assuming you have an MP4 file to try this on, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hit the Windows key + r.</li>
<li>Type <code>cmd</code> then enter.</li>
<li>Change the path to where the file is that you want to work on. Type <code>cd [path]</code>. It should look something like <code>cd C:\Users\name\Desktop\</code>.</li>
<li>Now type the ffmpeg command with the name of your input file. The command will run with some feedback. When it's done, cmd will be available for more commands.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the basic way to use ffmpeg. The commands can get far more complicated, but that's only because the program has so much power. Using <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the ffmpeg documentation</a>, you can learn all the commands and create some very powerful scripts. After that, you can save these scripts into a .bat file so that you just have to double click a file instead of type out the whole command each time. For example, <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/a/20494/3643"">this answer contains a script that will create MP3's from all the MP4's in a folder</a>. Then we would be combining the power of ffmpeg with the power of cmd, and that's a nice place to be when you have to do professional quality video/audio encoding on mountains of files.</p>

<p>I also want to know whether I can use FFMPEG on my server for users to convert images to a video file to be emailed them.  This service is also a payable product.</p>

<p>I have read the links to the FFMPEG licensing info and I read many questions here on these boards.</p>

<p>The closet I have got to an answer is that I can use it on my web server becuase I am not distributing it to client PCS and I can use FFMPEG on a my desktop app if I only use certain features of FFMPEG - whatever they are/</p>

<p>However, this is not definitive enough for me and I cannot afford a lawyer and you would think this question/dilemma would have been resolved somewhere by someone considering how popular FFMPEG is.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<h1>Yes, you can use FFmpeg in a commercial product</h1>

<p>FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (<strong>LGPL</strong>) version 2.1 or later.</p>

<p>Some features, such as support for some external libraries (libx264 and libx265 for example) and various filters, are covered by the GNU General Public License (<strong>GPL</strong>) version 2 or later (see commercial x264 license exception below). If those parts get used the GPL applies to all of FFmpeg. See <code>LICENSE.md</code> in the source to see a list of GPL parts of FFmpeg and which external libraries require GPL.</p>

<p>So, yes, <strong>you can definitely use FFmpeg in commercial products</strong>, and both licenses allow commercial usage, distribution, and modification. FFmpeg is free but is not available under any other licensing terms.</p>

<p>Which license you use is up to you, and depends on what your needs are and how your FFmpeg build is configured, but <strong>you must comply with whatever license you end up using</strong>. FFmpeg does not care if you use it for a commercial purpose or not: only that you properly follow the license.</p>

<h1>What do I need to do to comply?</h1>

<p>If you're just using FFmpeg for private or in-house use, or you are not actually distributing anything from FFmpeg at all then you don't need to do anything. Otherwise, for a very verbose list see the <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FFmpeg License Compliance Checklist</a>. To summarize you need to:</p>

<h3>GPL 2.0+</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make available the exact FFmpeg source code that you used.</li>
<li>Provide a copy of the appropriate FFmpeg license with your distributed software (see <code>COPYING.GPLv2</code> or <code>COPYING.GPLv3</code>).</li>
<li>State changes. If you modify the FFmpeg source code you must document what was changed.</li>
<li>Use same license. If you modify the FFmpeg source code it must remain under the same license.</li>
</ul>

<h3>LGPL 2.1+</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make available the exact FFmpeg source code that you used.</li>
<li>Provide a copy of the appropriate FFmpeg license with your distributed software (see <code>COPYING.LGPLv2.1</code> or <code>COPYING.LGPLv3</code>).</li>
<li>State changes. If you modify the FFmpeg source code you must document what was changed.</li>
<li>Use same license. If you modify the FFmpeg source code it must remain under the same license. This does not apply if you are just using linked FFmpeg libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What license is my FFmpeg using?</h1>

<p>The <code>ffmpeg -L</code> command will output a paragraph indicating your license. Example for LGPL v2.1+:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ffmpeg is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
  under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published
  by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>What about the x264 commercial license?</h1>

<p>The x264 commercial license is LGPL compatible, but FFmpeg does not have an option that disables the GPL requirement for commerical licensed x264 so you have to do that manually. Therefore, if you purchase a commercial license from <a href=""https://licensing.x264.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">x264 licensing</a> then you are permitted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compile x264 with <code>--disable-gpl</code>.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>configure</code> file in the FFmpeg source code to move libx264 from <code>EXTERNAL_LIBRARY_GPL_LIST</code> to <code>EXTERNAL_LIBRARY_LIST</code>.</li>
<li>Compile ffmpeg <strong>without</strong> <code>--enable-gpl</code> and link to your x264 that has been compiled <strong>with</strong> <code>--disable-gpl</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The LGPL still applies in this case, so don't forget to make available the exact FFmpeg source code you used and state what changes you made.</p>

<h2>Do I need a commercial license from x264?</h2>

<p>You do if your application is not GPL-compatible and is being distributed with linked x264. See <a href=""https://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/x264-devel/2010-July/007508.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[x264-devel] Announcing commercial licensing for x264</a> for additional details.</p>

"Convert a 60 fps video to a 24 (film) video - is it possible?","11672","","<p>This may not be as simple a problem as it may seem at first, so read carefully.</p>

<p>When I set my (Canon 60D, but this doesn't really matter at all) camera to record at 24 fps (I think it's actually 23.976 fps, but again, this shouldn't really matter), the film fps, it looks so ""perfect"", like any Hollywood movie. It is a bit stuttery, kind of ""low fps"" on the first sight, but it's exactly how it should look - a perfect film - and this is exactly what I want.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is, when I record at 60 fps to have a few more frames in case I need a slowmotion, the movie (when played back at 60 fps) looks too ""fluid, fast"", like a low-budget documentary movie or something like that.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong>: Can I record all my scenes at 60 fps and <em>then</em> somehow ""convert"" the 60 fps footage so that it looks like it was recorded at 24 fps ?</p>

<p>The reason: I need to record all the scenes in 60 fps, because I don't know which of them I will need in slowmotion later. I <em>cannot</em> record in 24 fps, but I <em>do want</em> the final cut to look as if it was recorded in 24.</p>
","<p>You can, there's a lot of frame blending algorithms that will do it for you. That said, none of them is really great. All your 60fps footage will have a different look than your 24fps footage. You flat out cannot evenly go from 60fps to 24fps, there's just too little overlap in where the frames actually show up on a timeline. For frame conversions of that magnitude (24p->60i for TV, for example), the big boys have traditionally used telecine/telesync setups where they would literally film an image projected from a movie reel with a television camera.  </p>

<p>Consider shooting 50fps (if that's an option). It's much easier to go from 50 to 24 (drop every other frame, then drop one frame a second) than it is to do 60->24.</p>

<p>The bandwidth is not great but I do not care about the quality of the livestream. I'm more concerned about highest quality video recording.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:
1) Which GoPro camera is appropriate for this job?
2) Is it possible to select some stream settings that will sacrifice the quality of the live stream for better quality recording?</p>

<p>Thanks.. </p>
","<p>No GoPro is appropriate for the job by itself.  Any of them (or even a basic webcam) could work as a camera, your problem is that you need something that can encode and send a stream by itself.  That is a specialized device and not something a GoPro can do.  You would want a either a device built for doing a direct stream (such as an IP camera) or you would want to have a camera with a clean HDMI (or other) output that can be fed in to a stand alone streaming device.</p>

<p>For the second half, recording quality and stream quality are completely and 100% independent of each other.  They are both two different captures of the same visual information, but the sensor is going to pick up maximum quality regardless of if you are recording in some low bandwidth format or not and the steam is going to run off the output which should be the high quality format regardless of what quality you are streaming at.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 30 -c:a copy output_h265.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>I used 30 as CRF for testing purposes because the artifacts are more visible :)</p>

<p>Could the loss of quality be caused by VLC and its experimental support in deconding h265? Maybe something more visible at lower bitrates?</p>
","<p>The CRF scales for x264 and x265 do not correspond. x265 CRF 28 is supposed to be e<a href=""https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.265"" rel=""nofollow"">quivalent</a> to x264 CRF 23. But x265 is not yet as mature in its development as x264, so take that CRF equivalence with a pinch of salt. </p>

<p>That said, you can try to establish your own calibration between the current versions of the encoding libraries in your ffmpeg by running the following command, which executes two popular video quality metrics:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i encoded-video.mp4 -i reference-video.mp4 -lavfi ""ssim;[0:v][1:v]psnr"" -f null -
</code></pre>

<p>The final lines of the console output will contain:</p>

<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 000000000039ad80] SSIM Y:0.984483 U:0.980458 V:0.980921 All:0.983219 (17.751712)

<p>So, run the command once with the x264 output and once with x265 and compare with different x265 outputs, till you get similar measures. Of course, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">these metrics</a> aren't perfect but you can use them as a rough guide to establish equivalence.</p>

<li>GoPro Studio (Best quality)</li>
<li>Keep high original bitrate, converted to 720p</li>

<p>I see decent quality movie (feature films) encodes, running at 1080p, with only 2K bit-rate...? Which makes for a decent file size of 1.5gb/90 minutes. My encodes are 1GB for 15 minutes, and look just terrible.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>P.S. I know from research, and observation, that the Sony AS-15 totally messes up with video compression. There are quite a lot of artefacts on very detailed scenes... Can this be the problem, that the source just isn't good enough to convert / work with?</p>

<p>If this is the case, are there any software to keep the original file bit-rate and FPS, but just scale down to 720p, in order to keep the initial quality as it was recorded, but make it a bit more usable..</p>
","<p>Taking a closer look at the footage now that I'm at home, it's mostly the level of activity and motion in the shots.  Even in the Sony video, the quality absolutely falls apart any time that there is high motion and unstable video.</p>

<p>The way video compression works, it depends on predictable and smooth motion to achieve good compression results, especially for on the fly recording like a camera has to do since it can't look forward in time and see how things are going to move any further than it can buffer, which is generally not going to be very far (probably sub-second).</p>

<p>There are two places you could get quality loss.  The first is in the recording itself.  If you aren't recording at sufficient data rates, then if there is too much motion, fine detail is going to get lost.  Uncompressed video is absolutely massive and even most video cameras record with moderate to heavy compression already applied.  If your source footage lacks detail (and isn't out of focus) then you need to work on stabilizing the camera to ensure it can better compress the video.  There are a number of different ways you can shock mount a camera to help provide some stabilization, though they also generally add weight.</p>

<p>If the source footage is ok, then the problem lies in the final compression for web/end-user consumption.  The fundamental problem is still the same, but we now have the option of using digital video stabilization to help make movement less random.  We also can use VBR 2-pass compression since we can now look ahead and see how thing move in the future as well as the past, which allows for far more accurate compression and more efficient use of bandwidth.</p>

<p>Additionally, some of the footage could use color grading to enhance the contrast.  Ideally footage should make full range of luminosity (brightness).  Your blacks should be dark black, but without obscuring detail in the shadows.  Your whites should be bright, but without fine detail bleeding in to pure white.  You can start with a white point and black point, but really, using something like curves is the best way to tweak the video to make the most use of the available range of luminosity.  This can also be quickly, but sloppily accomplished by increasing the contrast, but results often look far more artificial that way.  Color grading is best learned by doing it and it can vary throughout a clip.  It takes time and practice to get good at it.</p>

"FCPX => DaVinci Resolve => FCPX color grading round trip","10806","","<p>I'm trying to get my (non-graded) video from Final Cut Pro X through DaVinci Resolve 10.1 Lite, and back into FCPX for the last bits (audio, logos etc). The first part wasn't that hard, just export the FCPX project as XML, and load that from DaVinci Resolve. The color grading itself was a bit harder but still very doable.</p>

<p>The hardest part is getting the graded clips from DaVinci Resolve back into FCPX. I went to the <strong>Deliver</strong> page, set the <strong>Easy setup</strong> to <em>Final Cut Pro XML Round-Trip</em>, selected all the clips and selected a destination. After adding the job and running the job, I looked in the directory that was just created and saw a bunch of videos there and a <em>fcpxml</em> file. But importing that <em>fcpxml</em> file into FCPX just loads the clips from their original location...</p>

<p>So, how is this round trip supposed to work between Final Cut Pro X and DaVinci Resolve Lite?</p>

<p>I've spend the better part of today trying to figure that out, but all I can find are YouTube clips explaining how to do it with Premiere Pro or other video editors. And when I do manage to find something about Final Cut Pro X, it says I should just go to <strong>File</strong>=><strong>Export AAF, XML</strong>. Unfortunately that option is greyed out for me. And all the other docs are either refering to Resolve 8 or 9. Even the official documentation still refers to a <strong>Conform</strong> page which is long gone in Resolve 10, and replaced by the <strong>Color</strong> page. Too bad I can't find a way to export from there either :(</p>
","<p>Xudonax,</p>

<p>The preset Final Cut Pro XML Round-Trip renders the graded files in ProRes 422, but it uses an old XML file, not supported in FCPX. You need to go to the Edit (important!) section of DaVinci after rendering the project. Then you will be need to make File – Export AAF, XML... command and check the fcpxml version 1.3 type of file. It will be comfortable to save this five in the same folder used for rendered files in Deliver section.</p>

<p>After that you can do simple import of this FCPXML file in Final Cut Pro X, it will create new Event and Project in your current library with all your graded files.</p>

<p>Be sure to make render before XML-export. If you will export FCPXML ver. 1.3 without delivering, you will make the FCPX-project with original (non-graded) files.
Good luck!</p>

"What is the maximum amount of memory Adobe Premiere Pro can efficiently utilize?","10789","","<p>From my experience with programming I know that just throwing more memory against even a well paralized program will not speed it up after a certain limit due to various practical limitations (tasks can only be split in so many parts, waiting==processing or countless of other scenarios). Is there a limit at which which Adobe Premiere Pro doesn't speed up significantly anymore? Does it make sense to build a PC with 128GB or 512GB of memory? (My colleague is considering building a PC with 128GB and I am just a bit skeptical of this being... worth it, though I might be absolutely wrong as this really is not my area of expertise (and just for the record, I know that it's a 64-bit application and that it can address all available memory up to windows' limit, what I am asking is about the practical world)).</p>
","<p>That entirely depends on what kind of footage he work with and how long his average cuts are. If we are talking hour long movies a bigger amount of RAM can be worth it.
Though 128GB would be completely useless if he only uses Premiere it just doesn't use that much RAM.
We built a high-end workstation once for huge 3D renderings that has 64GB RAM, the only times we utilize that fully is when working with gigantic 3D scenes in Cinema 4D or 3Ds Max. After Effects barley goes beyond 20GB unless you need an hour long RAM previews for some reason and Premiere is usually around 5-7GB even when cutting 60min plus movies.
So if hes only using Premiere, 128GB would be a complete waste of money. I would not recommend anything more than 32GB on a video editing only workstation.</p>

<p>When using Premiere a high-end GPU is a lot more worth performance wise, Premiere can render in realtime with a powerfull GPU making having a ton of system RAM a bit useless.</p>

<p>I can recommend using gaming cards instead of workstation cards, the only difference is support and drivers, the gaming cards are much more powerful and a lot cheaper. I have never experienced any stability differences in Adobe software with a Workstation card compared to a gaming card. A good mixture of gaming GPU and workstation GPU is the GeForce GTX Titan, its meant for CUDA development and other CUDA usage.</p>

<p>Alternatively in the latest Premiere version there is also full OpenCL support, so a high-end AMD card would also be a good choice.
F.e. The R9 290X or if he wants a workstation GPU for some reason the FirePro W9100 is currently the high-end model, though a waste of money in my opinion. You do not need 16GB Vram with Premiere. I would probably go for the W9000 or W8000.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As AJ Henderson mentioned, footage gets almost never fully cached in RAM so a fast SSD or maybe an SSD array will be much more beneficial than more RAM aswell.
Going for fast disk I/O and a good GPU is a good combination nowadays. Having a high-end multi core CPU and lots of RAM is getting less and less important in the graphics world.</p>

<li><p>In the timelapse videos which don't use this trick, if people are moving, they suddenly appear at a precise frame, then disappear,</p></li>
<li><p>In the videos which use the trick, we have a feeling that they are smoothly moving, like if there was a motion blur.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What is this technique? What is it called? Is it done when taking photos or during post-processing?</p>
","<p>After Effects has a <strong>frame blending</strong> mode called ""<strong>Pixel Motion</strong>,"" which will attempt to match features in two temporally adjacent frames and smoothly blend between them. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohi-X7JKwVA"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>This video</strong></a> shows it in action, where it is used to generate filler frames for video footage that was slowed down 10x. As you can see, the results are mixed.</p>

<p>There is no magic bullet for filling in missing data. As the classic computer programming expression says, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" If you only need to blend between small changes in the scene between frames, this blending mode might help. Otherwise, your best bet is probably to just do a very fast plain fade between each image, which can be achieved with the ""Frame Mix"" blending mode.</p>

Reason is that the Cable operators in India (using Standard Channel Broadcasting) broadcasting 720p resolution output. As I have 1080p HDTV it does not displays output properly. Means that tiering the pixels.</p>

<p>Is there any converter available that converts 720p output from Channel (set top box) to 1080p so that I can view output properly.</p>

<p>If I go for HD Channels then issue will not be arised. But as HD channels have very high price range so could not afford them.</p>

<p>Edit: I am using 3 pin (red, yellow and white) cable which connects Set Top Box (digital signals) and my HDTV Toshiba 29PB200ZE. Is performance can be improved by installing other higher density cable like Coaxial?</p>
","<p>What you are talking about is upscaling and any current HDTV will do upscaling automatically.  Upscaling doesn't work miracles though, it will only make it so that the lower quality signal can be watched on a higher quality display.  It just multiplies the pixels so that a 720 by 480 (.9 pixel compressed) signal for example doesn't end up only taking up 1/4 of your screen.  It doesn't make the video any higher quality (it in fact will be slightly lower quality than if you were to watch it at the native resolution).</p>

<p>Your problem however is not lack of upscaling.  Your problem is using the wrong signal.  You are currently connecting your cable box to your TV through what is known as a composite cable.  It's an old type of analog connection that includes all the video information on the single yellow pin and sends left and right audio on the white and red pins respectively.  It is only capable of reproducing a standard definition signal so you are not actually using HD signals.</p>

<p>To benefit from 720 or 1080 signals, you will have to either use analog Component video (the red/green/blue connectors) or use an HDMI cable.  It's worth noting that as long as your TV and cable box both have component inputs/outputs, you can actually re-purpose the existing Composite cable to carry a component signal, but there will be no audio (you need a separate white/red pair for the audio, which is the same format as with the composite signal).</p>

<p>Once you fix the cable and hookup issue, you should see better image quality.  Personally, I'd recommend using HDMI if it is available on both your cable box and TV as that is the easiest to setup and will give a nice digital signal.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>You want images of varying degrees of zoom that you can align and then scale between.  You start from far out and as you zoom in, you fade in the image that is slightly closer (and aligned to the other image).  Once the closer image takes up the full screen, you remove the first image from the background and place the next level of zoom in the correct spot and start fading it in.</p>

<p>Repeat this process for each level of zoom you can get until you reach your target level of zoom.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to align and animate the images without any transparency and then add the transparency after.  This helps to ensure the proper look before you blend the images together.</p>

<p>Note that this requires a video editor capable of keyframe animation.  If you don't have one, then your options are far more limited and there may not be a good way to do it.</p>

"FFMpeg Encoding and Core Usage","10030","","<p>We have developed an application to transcode source .mov files into .ogg, .mp4 and .webm output. It is currently running on AWS EC2 instance g2.8xlarge. It is working (yay!).</p>

<p>My question: Even though I am passing in <code>-threads 0</code> to the ffmpeg command (actually setting <code>ffmpeg.threads</code> configuration in <a href=""https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">php-ffmpeg</a>),  the running process is sometimes only being executed on a single core. Why is this happening?  See below output from <code>htop</code> command:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrJm8.png"" alt=""htop output""></p>

<p>As you can see, Core #21 is maxed out.  In a few seconds, it's going to switch to another one, rather than max out all of them like I would like and greatly speed up my encoding process.  The situation is transient; during some runs all of the processors <em>are</em> maxed out, but during others they are not and we only get use of the one processor.  A colleague mentioned that perhaps the codec we're using for some of the formats don't support multi-threaded execution during encoding, though I can't verify that is the behavior I'm observing yet.</p>

<p>Is this the case?  If so, what codecs for the formats above will allow us to transcode into these target formats while taking advantage of all of our available hardware?  The default codecs set for php-ffmpeg are below;</p>

<pre><code>         Video        Audio
Ogg    libtheora    libvorbis
WebM   libvpx       libvorbis
X264   libx264      libfaac
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the running processes, below is what winds up being the ffmpeg command that is run for an MP4 (currently saturating all 32 cores):</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -y -i my-video.mov -async 1 -metadata:s:v:0 start_time=0 -async 1 -metadata:s:v:0 -async 1 -metadata:s:v:0 start_time=0 -async 1 -metadata:s:v:0 start_time=0  -s 1920x1080 -s 1920x1080 -s 1280x720 -threads 0 -vcodec libx264 -acodec libfaac -b:v 1200k -refs 6 -coder 1 -sc_threshold 40 -flags +loop -me_range 16 -subq 7 -i_qfactor 0.71 -qcomp 0.6 -qdiff 4 -trellis 1 -b:a 128k -pass 2 -passlogfile /tmp-ffmpeg-passes55ad0d0233f711zdrg/pass-44ad0d02340a8 my-video-1200.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not actually building this command directly, <code>php-ffmpeg</code> is, though I do believe I have at least a modest amount of control over what goes in to it (for instance, I have no idea why there's multiple <code>-metadata:s:v:0</code> entries at the beginning)</p>
","<p>BTW, this question might be better on stackoverflow, or maybe unix.stackexchange, or maybe serverfault.  This site is I think less focused on questions that don't involve decisions based on creative merit or at least perceptual video / audio quality.  However, I'm all about the tech details, so I'll answer.</p>

<p>FFmpeg uses multi-threading by default, so you prob. don't need <code>-threads 0</code>.  If your encode is bottlenecked on a single-threaded filter or decoder, you'll see full load on one core, and light load on many other cores.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is check mediainfo of your output video.  x264 leaves its settings in an ASCII string in the h.264 header.  So either <code>strings -n20</code> or <code>mediainfo</code> to get:</p>

<p>Note the ""threads=4"" in there.  I think I manually set that on my quad core i5 2500k, instead of letting x264 use the default CPUs * 1.5, since I had a CPU-intensive filters (hqdn3d and lanczos-downscale) running.</p>

<p>Anyway, libx264 with a preset like <code>slower</code> should have <em>no</em> trouble keeping a lot of cores busy.  There are some parts of encoding that are inherently serial (e.g. the CABAC encode of the final bitstream), so a high-bitrate video that doesn't spend a lot of CPU-time refining references (high <code>subme</code>) to multiple frames (high <code>ref</code>) might show a load pattern like yours (one thread using 100% CPU, others not).</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure about faster presets being less parallel, but I know CABAC is serial.</p>

<p>To get massively parallel, libx264 could use a boatload of RAM to keep frames around, and keep doing lookahead for 2 or more GOPs, and encode those independently.  It doesn't have an option to operate that way, though.</p>

<p>One way to make use of MANY cores is to run multiple separate encodes in parallel, instead of just a series of single encode using all cores.  This only works if you have multiple input files that you want encoded separately.  You're trading off threading overhead vs. more memory capacity and bandwidth (with an impact on caching, unless this is on a multi-socket system with separate L3 and DRAM for each cluster of CPUs, <em>and</em> you have the processes pinned to cores so one encode is using the cores in one socket, and the other the other).</p>

"MP4 / h.264 patent issues?","9833","","<p>I know this is not a legal forum but I'm assuming this is a daily issue for most people on this site since h.264 video (AVC / MPEG4 part10) is so ubiquitous (and there <em>is</em> a <code>legal</code> tag here).</p>

<p>I've read about patent issues with h.264 video, but am a bit confused about it. Is there any problem with creating a video (using ffmpeg or any other tool) for commercial use? Or is the problem only for anybody writing software that creates this video type?</p>
","<p><strong>IANAL</strong>, but as far as I understand it, if you're charging viewers for h.264 / MPEG-4 AVC content you do need to pay license fees. Even though x264 / ffmpeg are Free with a big F, they are just software libraries for encoding video streams into the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC format, which <em>is</em> covered by the MPEG patent. But the threshold for when fees are applicable is fairly high.</p>

<p>Is any of those methods recommended? If not, what are the upsides/downsides of each method?</p>

<p>1) Calculate and set Bitrate to match the length of the video as explained in the <a href=""https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264#Two-PassExample"" rel=""noreferrer"">ffmpeg-wiki</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(10 MB * 8192 [converts MB to kilobits]) / 60 seconds = ~1365 kbits/s total bitrate
  1365k - 128k (desired audio bitrate) = 1237k video bitrate</p>

","<p>The <code>fs</code> parameter will stop the encode once it hits its value. So, if the output hits the <code>10MB</code> mark while encoding the 15th second, then that's the duration of your output file.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure that the entire file is encoded but it doesn't cross the set target size, then use the bitrate method. To accommodate the muxing overhead and other data within the target size, set your video bitrate slightly lower by, say, 1-2%</p>

"FFMPEG convert video with multiple audio streams?","9716","","<p>Ok so I have a video made from dxtory. The video is using dxtory video codec and unknown audio codec.

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i ""The Bunker.avi"" -vcodec h264 TheBunkerMix.mp4

<p>But, the resultant file only had one track/source. Basically I recorded game footage and the original file had both the in game sounds as well as the mic recording commentary on top. But, when I did the conversion my audio commentary track/source got lost in conversion. What other options can I include to get my audio tracks?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>I've gotten close now, but still not right. I have used the following but again its seems to ignore the first -map option. If I flipped which map comes second, that is the stream that is audible in the output. How do I mux them together so they both play?</p>

  Stream #0:0 -&gt; #0:0 (dxtory -&gt; libx264)
  Stream #0:1 -&gt; #0:1 (pcm_s16le -&gt; libmp3lame)
  Stream #0:2 -&gt; #0:2 (pcm_s16le -&gt; libmp3lame)

","<p>If you copied your command there then your issue is probably <code>-acodec:0 mp</code>. That should be <code>-acodec:0 mp3</code>.</p>

<p>You can just use <code>-c:a mp3</code> to apply the encoding options to all audio tracks at once, no need to apply them for each individually.</p>

<p>Other than that your mapping is correct and shouldn't be the issue.</p>

<p>Edit: To conclude the discussion in the comments regarding the actual reason behind the question: When it comes to editing it is no problem to just transcode the video stream if the source codec makes problems and import the audio from the source file by either muxing the audio into a new container with the transcoded video stream or just importing the transcoded video and audio streams separately (by demuxing the source) into your editing program and skip on the container format.</p>

<p>This is probably not the answer you want to hear, but the best way to stabilize footage is to shoot stable footage in the first place.  Software stabilization is really just analogous to fine grit sandpaper; It's a good final step to add polish, but you'd never use it from the start.</p>

"Reduce File Size of Dxtory Video Without Causing Lag","8373","","<p>I'm making videos while playing on my computer. Everything is working well, however 15 minutes of video consumes 50GB, which is too much space. I use Dxtory with Lagarith Lossless Codec.  If I use the default Codecs I get lag.</p>

<p>How can I reduce this 50GB without causing lag?</p>
","<p>The problem with compression is that it is a double edged sword. It can reduce the space required to store video, however it also takes processing time to perform the compression.</p>

<p>When you are running a game, however, the CPU and GPU are already busy keeping the game running smoothly. In order to shrink the file size, you must either reduce the quality or increase the compression. If you increase the compression, the computer has to take more away from the game and you start seeing lag.</p>

<p>The only ways around this are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) reduce the resolution of the video you are recording.  Throwing
away information is free and will also make applying further
compression less processor intensive.  </li>
<li>b) move the encoding to another system.  Some recorders can send the data to another computer and have that computer perform the encoding.  I am not sure if Dxtory supports this or not though.</li>
<li>c) Continue to use the uncompressed files and transcode the video after you record a clip. </li>
</ul>

<p>Of these options, c is probably the easiest way to maintain maximum quality.  You can use a program like <strong>Handbrake</strong> to take the large file and compress it down to something of reasonable size, just so long as you don't have to record more than you have room for at a given time.  Note that this process can take quite some time depending on the quality level you choose and how fast your computer is.</p>

"What benefit would I get from using Apple Compressor instead of just exporting from Final Cut Pro X?","8197","","<p>I have Final Cut Pro X 10.1.4. I usually always use the ""share"" option to export my video and select whatever format I want to share with. Usually either ""Master File"" or ""YouTube"". I also see the option to ""Send to Compressor"". I researched Apple Compressor and I am trying to figure out if it is worth the money. Does it really export with better options than just what can be done with Final Cut Pro? Also, to convert to different formats I have used Miro Video converter and Handbrake. Does Apple Compressor have a much better system or output than either of these other video converters? Just want to know if it is really worth the $50 USD for Apple Compressor.</p>

<p>Thanks for any input.</p>
","<p>The export settings you are using in Final Cut Pro X are preset Compressor settings and the export itself is actually using the Compressor engine (but with no user control). Compressor allows you control over those settings and to save your own custom presets.</p>

<p>For instance, you may want to export an MPEG2 file with a particular bitrate, letterbox 16:9 footage in a 4:3 file, export to Vimeo with custom settings, or any other number of possibilities. If you wanted all of these outputs, you could batch process them. These, and other, codec/compression options can be configured in Compressor and saved as custom presets. Those saved custom presets then appear as available Share options in FCPX.</p>

<p>Compressor allows for encoding without requiring FCPX to be open, or for converting files that don't originate from a FCPX project among other benefits. It also provides a preview window that allows you to compare your source video to processed video before committing.</p>

<p>I still sometimes use Handbrake for h.264 files. It's very fast, clean, and free. In those cases, I will export a ProRes ""master file"" out of FCPX to bring into Handbrake.</p>

<p>Compressor is not a perfect program, but it is very useful. A lot of it depends on your workflow needs. If you like exporting directly from FCPX, but need custom share options, then Compressor is probably worth it  for you.

"Can a camera like Nikon D810 support 4K video with firmware update?","8075","","<p>Is it possible to update the firmware of a camera (like Nikon D810) to enable 4K video? Or, such features are built into the hardware?</p>

<p>Thanks, NN</p>
","<p>Yes and no.  Any camera with a sensor larger than 8mp (and the correct aspect ratio) is capable of recording 4k video frames.  Firmware can grab frames off the sensor as fast as the sensor can read out.  The ability to record video at a given frame rate is a limitation of the sensor's ability to read fast enough, the processor's ability to encode fast enough and the card reader that can write the data out fast enough.</p>

<p>Practically however, most cameras that don't have 4k are unlikely to have fast enough performance in all these areas to be able to hack 4k resolution in.  It's simply too much data to move and most cameras didn't design that kind of over-engineering to be able to deal with all 3 of those conditions.  Even the Canon 5D Mark iii, which is a high end professional DSLR which can be hacked to shoot RAW video at decent frame rates at 2 to 2.5k ends up having to be dropped down to around 12 or fewer FPS for trying to hack it in to shooting 3k or 4k video.</p>

<p>This is also partly compounded by the fact that most of the real time encoders are built for particular resolutions.  For example, the previously mentioned 5D Mark iii hack works by recording raw frames which takes a huge amount of data rate for storage.</p>

<p>So, in some cases, there may be ways to get some level of 4k support from a third party firmware, but for the most part, you are limited by what hardware was originally put in and often (most of the time) it simply isn't going to be possible to increase to 4k by third party hacks.</p>

<p>As for the Nikon D810 specifically, I'm not aware of any highly developed third party firmwares for Nikon bodies that are similar to Magic Lantern, so I don't think there is anyone really exploring that in depth at this time for Nikon bodies.  That series is similar in spec to the 5D mark iii, so it may be possible to get low framerate 4k video on very fast cards, but that's purely speculation.  I wouldn't count on seeing it any time soon or having it be highly usable though.</p>

"How to DISABLE--NOT REMOVE subtitle tracks from an MKV file from the command line?","7683","","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT DISABLING--NOT REMOVING SUBTITLE TRACKS FROM MKV FILES FROM THE COMMAND LINE. PERIOD.</strong></p>
  
  <p>It IS NOT about REMOVING subtitles by REMUXING with <code>mkvmerge</code> or any other tool. There are literally thousands of threads about removal by remuxing. That's precisely why I started this thread about DISABLING NOT REMOVING subtiles. I could not find a single thread about that.</p>
  
  <p>It is NOT about GLOBALLY DISABLING subtitles in any PLAYER. That is obviously trivial and doesn't need any explanation. I don't need/want to do that and, if I did, I obviously wouldn't have taken the time to research the topic at hand and publish my findings in this thread.</p>
  
  <p>I shouldn't have to add this disclaimer but there have been a number of, in most cases demeaning, 'answers' that reveal a distinct misunderstanding of the OP, suggesting irrelevant 'solutions', and/or criticizing this hack as being 'O-h-h-h-so-difficult' if you want to re-enable the subtitle track at a later date. As I pointed out numerous times, anyone who can understand my answer and who knows how to use the command line will find this task trivial. Those who don't SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT this hack.</p>
  
  <p>The answer has already been given as this is the entire point of this thread. So any new answers are either superfluous or, in SOME cases, irrelevant.

  <p>I welcome any CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions that ADHERE TO THE TOPIC, in a COMMENT, but any 'answers' or negative comments will be unanswered and flagged as inappropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that THAT is out of the way, let us begin…</p>

<p>I couldn't find out how to do this anywhere so I thought I'd share this hack with others who, like me, want to <strong>DISABLE</strong>, NOT REMOVE, subtitles in MKV files. </p>

<p><strong>There are times when you don't want the subtitles that are embedded in a file and you don't want to have to disable subtitles every time you play such a file or globally disable subtitles in every player you happen to have. Or you may want to automatically use a subtitle (<code>srt</code>) file that is preferable.</strong></p>

<p>Sure, you can completely REMOVE subtitles with <code>mkvmerge</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mkvmerge --no-subtitles ""inputfile.mkv"" -o ""outputfile.mkv""
</code></pre>

<p>But this is heavy-handed and a real pain if you have a bunch of multi-GB files. It takes lots of time and disk space to de- and re-mux every file. So I turned to <code>mkvpropedit</code> which edits the properties of the subtitle track header in milliseconds. Note that this tool is installed when you install  <a href=""https://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/"" rel=""nofollow"">MKVToolNix</a>. Unfortunately, it is not at all obvious how to use this wonderful tool for the task at hand. Here's an example of the properties of a subtitle track as given by <code>mkvinfo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>| + A track
|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge &amp; mkvextract: 3)
|  + Track UID: 11363869179551629452
|  + Track type: subtitles
|  + Default flag: 0
|  + Lacing flag: 0
|  + Codec ID: S_TEXT/UTF8
|  + Name: CC
</code></pre>

<p>Despite the <code>default flag</code> setting <code>0</code> (false), the subtitle track is still active by default in players. I later read in the <code>mkvmerge</code> documentation ""<em>If no track is set to be the default track then mkvmerge will promote the first track of each type that it finds to be the default track. This is consistent with the behavior of various media players.</em>"" I'm not sure if this means that it sets the <code>default flag</code> to <code>1</code> or somehow otherwise arranges for the track to be the default, but it seems maybe the latter.</p>

<p>I tried adding the <code>track enabled</code> property set to false but it didn't work.</p>

<pre><code>mkvpropedit --edit track:4 --set flag-enabled=0 ""inputfile.mkv""

| + A track
|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge &amp; mkvextract: 3)
|  + Track UID: 11363869179551629452
|  + Track type: subtitles
|  + Default flag: 0
|  + Lacing flag: 0
|  + Codec ID: S_TEXT/UTF8
|  + Name: CC
|  + Enabled: 0
</code></pre>
","<p>I gave up and contacted the author of <code>mkvpropedit</code> to ask if it was possible to do what I wanted to do. The first answer I got was 'No'. But I persevered and asked if there was any setting that will trick the player into not recognizing a subtitle track? The response was to set the Codec ID to something the player doesn't support. Eureka!</p>

<pre><code>mkvpropedit --edit track:4 --set codec-id=DISABLED ""inputfile.mkv""

| + A track
|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge &amp; mkvextract: 3)
|  + Track UID: 11363869179551629452
|  + Track type: subtitles
|  + Default flag: 0
|  + Lacing flag: 0
|  + Codec ID: DISABLED
|  + Name: CC
</code></pre>

<p>This worked! The player doesn't recognize any subtitle track. In milliseconds I have achieved my goal. No time-consuming remux. Nice.</p>

<p>The procedure for doing this hack is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get track number of the subtitle track</p>

<pre><code>mkvinfo ""inputfile.mkv""
…
| + A track
|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge &amp; mkvextract: 3)
|  + Track UID: 11363869179551629452
|  + Track type: subtitles
|  + Default flag: 0
|  + Lacing flag: 0
|  + Codec ID: S_TEXT/UTF8
|  + Name: CC
…
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>mkvmerge --identify ""inpufile.mkv"" | grep subtitles 
Track ID 3: subtitles (SubRip/SRT)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>mkvinfo</code> gives the proper 1-indexed track number that <code>mkvpropedit</code> uses, BUT <strong><code>mkvmerge</code> gives a 0-indexed number so you have to add <code>1</code>.  Be sure to do this or you'll mess up the wrong track!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Change the <code>Codec ID</code> to some nonsense name so the track is not recognized as a subtitle track. (In this case the track number is 4 but it will be different for other files.)</p>

<pre><code>mkvpropedit --edit track:4 --set codec-id=DISABLED ""inputfile.mkv""

| + A track
|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge &amp; mkvextract: 3)
|  + Track UID: 11363869179551629452
|  + Track type: subtitles
|  + Default flag: 0
|  + Lacing flag: 0
|  + Codec ID: DISABLED
|  + Name: CC

Track ID 3: subtitles (DISABLED)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>If you think you may at some time want to enable the track, keep a copy of the original <code>Codec ID</code>. As suggested by Jim Mack, it would be expedient to just add an obvious character to the existing <code>Codec ID</code>, thus preserving the original ID.</p>

<p>This hack works on files that have multiple subtitle tracks. Just repeat the renaming procedure for each track.</p>

"H.264 or VP9 for encoding for YouTube?","7552","","<p>I make short films which I distribute through YouTube. I know YouTube uses VP9 for streaming, but YouTube still recommends uploading with h.264. It makes more sense to me to upload in as similar a format as will be streamed by YouTube, but I might be missing something.</p>

<p>Also, would uploading in a higher quality codec like DNxHR or Prores (I'm not concerned about bandwidth or processing time) better preserve video quality after YouTube's encoding?</p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Since Youtube reencodes all videos regardless of the upload format, it really isn't that important. Just export your video with a high bitrate to preserve quality. Also see <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/a/15815/6273"">my answer here</a> regarding quality loss caused by Youtube.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Each reencoding of a video to a compressed format lowers the quality. Usually, that means you'll lose quality at two points: When you export the edited video from your editing software and when you upload the exported video to Youtube, at which point it is reencoded to a highly compressed, streaming-compatible format. You have no control over that second step, so what you can do to achieve the maximum quality possible is make sure you lose as little quality as possible during the first encoding.<br>
In theory, that would mean export to a <em>perceptually</em> (even though technically not) uncompressed format like Apple ProRes or DNxHD as you suggested. However, unfortunately, <a href=""https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Youtube doesn't support those formats</a>, so you'll have to use a compressed format. To minimize quality loss, set a high bitrate in your export settings (assuming rendering and upload time aren't an issue. If they are, you'll have to find some middle ground; exporting with a bitrate that is higher than the bitrate of the source material won't yield any more quality, so that is as high as I would go). If you do that, it doesn't really matter which codec you use, both are highly efficient regarding file-size/quality ratio (VP9 probably a bit more so, but that's more important when you're dealing with low bitrates). <a href=""https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Youtube recommends H264</a>, so that's what I would use. However, the best advice I can give you is to try out both, i.e. export the same video as both H264 and VP9 with identical bitrates/other settings, upload both to youtube and check which one looks better to you.</p>

<p>To give you a rough idea how that'd look like in Ruby, see <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2574696"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Gist of mine</a>. It contains a script that takes an edit list, a folder of videos, and cuts them accordingly. I've used it very often for cutting videos based on an input edit list.</p>

<p>The edit list would look like that, with the timestamps in the proper FFmpeg format (e.g. 00:00:24.240) and the difference passed to <code>-t</code> in the last column.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M01G8.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Note that you can't expect it to work with any input/output without synchronization issues. If that's the case, you need to re-encode video and audio parts. I wouldn't use that script of mine though as it's not very … eloquent in that regard. Rather cut your video in a NLE.</p>

"How to cut a single clip in a Sequence into multiple clips for use in multiple Sequences in Premiere Pro","7532","","<p>I have a single clip of a multi-speaker conference in Premiere Pro CS6 that I need to split into individual clips of each speaker, so that I can make a timeline of each clip with the end goal of exporting several individual videos, rather than one long video of the entire conference.</p>

<p>I've already split the clip up within a Sequence using the Razor Tool and removed extraneous footage, like so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvPUm.png"" alt=""razor at work""></p>

<p>How can I get these split-up and renamed clips to their own individual Sequences for production as separate video files? (If there is a Premiere shortcut or tool specifically for this, I haven't found it)</p>
","<p>The easiest way I've found is to simply click the New Item button at the bottom-right of the Project window and select ""Sequence..."" to create a new one; you'll need one Sequence for each clip section you've created:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AOaNf.png"" alt=""New item location""></p>

<p>From there, You can simply copy/cut and paste each section of video into its respective Sequence. You'll want to make sure the old sections are removed from the original Sequence if you want to use that one. Otherwise, you can just delete the original Sequence when you're finished.</p>

<hr>

<p>You could copy each section into your Project Window by dragging and dropping it, but that creates two extra steps (and can be confusing if you haven't already renamed your split-up files in the original sequence): </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The new file in the Project Window won't be aware that you've renamed it in the timeline, so you'll have to rename the new clip; it'll have the same name as the original source clip, <em>even if</em> you rename the original source clip to something else. </p></li>

"How do I recover truncated AVI/DV video?","7418","","<p><strong>Short version:</strong> I believe I have truncated but otherwise valid AVI/DV files that won't play in any player I've tried (Adobe Premiere, MPC HC, VLC). I assume the stream data is intact but truncated, and the container is damaged. Are the files still recoverable and how would I accomplish this?</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong> Having finished a recording from a Sony AnyCast workstation with two cameras to a FireWire hard disk drive, I accidentially unplugged the hard disk drive without ""disconnecting"" (unmounting) it first.</p>

<p>The result was a corrupted ext3 filesystem that would not mount under the Windows Ext2 IFS setup I was using to download the videos, so I connected the hard disk to a Linux laptop and ran e2fsck on it. After this, I was able to list the directory and copy the files, but the files appeared corrupted.</p>

<p>I'm working under the assumption that I've only lost some data at the end of the two video files. (This might prove false as e2fsck might have wrecked havoc on them.) That would mean I have 1,5 hours (x2) of unscathed DV stream. Unfortunately, my layman analysis concludes that these lost bits must have contained some information vital to the container format.</p>

<p>Note that all I have are the files copied to an NTFS volume from the fsck'ed ext3 volume. I no longer have access to the original hard disk drive.</p>

<p>Dear StackExchange, please help me find a way to recover and reconstruct these files! I suspect what I would need is some software that would guess or be told the information usually contained in the container header, copy the stream data and write it into a new, valid container file.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I believe the format is DV instead of MPEG2.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> It seems that the broken files do <em>not</em> in fact have an AVI header at all - they should begin with the bytes ""RIFF"" which they do not. <code>ffprobe</code> <em>does</em> recognize the stream format, though:</p>

<pre><code>[dv @ 0xefb8a0] Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate
Input #0, dv, from '120610-1-001.avi':
  Duration: 02:08:36.84, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 28799 kb/s
    Stream #0.0: Video: dvvideo, yuv420p, 720x576, 28800 kb/s, PAR 64:45 DAR 16:9, 25 tbr, 25 tbn, 25 tbc
    Stream #0.1: Audio: pcm_s16le, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 1536 kb/s
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit3:</strong> Thanks to Matti ""Lumpio-"" Virkkunen, we've finally got the video files fixed. He wrote a good 400 lines of C that did exactly what @JEEB suggested: crafted an AVI header and searched for things that look like AVI chunks, copying them over to the output file. A long AVI file needs a new header between every gigabyte or so, and the program simply fixes the broken first section and then copies the following sections as-is. The <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2959531"" rel=""nofollow"">source code for <code>fixavi.c</code></a> can be found on Gist.</p>

<p>Please note that details such as codecs, audio sample rate and video frame rate are hard-coded in the source, so if you need to replicate this process, please adapt the source to your needs. I found <a href=""http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/documentation/avi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Alexander Noe's AVI format guide</a> a good reference on the AVI file format.</p>

<p><strong>Edit4:</strong> And as <code>fixavi.c</code> does not create an index at the end of the AVI file, I simply used <code>./fixavi broken.avi recovered_without_index.avi; ffmpeg -i recovered_without_index.avi -acodec copy -vcodec copy recovered_with_index.avi</code> to make one.</p>
","<p>First of all, if I remember correctly, the DV format is intra-only, and thus if there is various damage that has happened to your video, there should be a relatively big chance of getting at least something out -- given that the file isn't completely broken in the most relevant of places.</p>

<p>A good way of checking if there's at least some kind of sanity left in the file is indeed by the aforementioned <code>ffmpeg|avconv -i input.avi</code> or <code>ffprobe|avprobe input.avi</code>. If ffmpeg/avconv and/or the related probe application can 'see' the format as well as other information there's at least some hope that the file actually still contains some of the things you're hoping it contains.</p>

<p>As for actual recovery attempts, I would actually first make a copy of the file (backups are generally useful, even if it's a backup of possibly broken data), and try to open it with Avery Lee's <a href=""http://www.virtualdub.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">VirtualDub</a>, as I remember it having one of the good general AVI reconstruction mechanisms I've seen so far. If you are lucky and there's enough data for VirtualDub to actually do something with the file, it should ask if you want to repair/reconstruct the index and so forth. After that you can set both audio and video to 'Direct stream copy', and just remux with another file name, and see if that works.</p>

<p>Another way to try and salvage it is to use ffmpeg/avconv, and use the stream copying function there (of course this might not work at all in case ffmpeg/avconv or the related probe application cannot see what container/video/audio format the file is). <code>ffmpeg|avconv -i input.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy out.avi</code></p>

<p>A yet another way to try and salvage something is by trying out the now-discontinued <a href=""http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/"" rel=""nofollow"">AVI-Mux GUI</a>. I have not tried it myself, but I have some hazy memories of people fixing their broken AVI files by remuxing with it a few years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
And of course the so-called final destination would be to see if there are any chunk-like entities in the file, and manually recreating the AVI header and friends before it either via scripting or with a hex editor, looking at the related <a href=""http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Microsoft_Audio/Video_Interleaved"" rel=""nofollow"">technical documentation</a>.</p>

"The ProRes of Premiere Pro?","7151","","<p>I'm going to be editing more and more DSLR videos, most notably music videos for my band as we start releasing singles and want to know if there is an intermediate format for both cutting and exporting that rivals the kind of features found in ProRes 422 used in Final Cut?</p>

<p>Is it possible to use ProRes in Premiere Pro anyway (with the same advantages in editing speed and bit-depth)?</p>

<ul>
<li>I-frame encoding/decoding for speed.</li>
<li>Higher sample depth for making image modifications.</li>
<li>Intended for 720p 60fps H.264 footage captured from Canon EOS 60D.</li>
</ul>

<p>If ProRes itself can be used in Premiere Pro, I have all the tools I need to begin transcoding. Just wondering if anyone has some workflow/codec tips for using an intermediate editing/exporting format in Premiere instead of directly editing .MOVs.</p>

<p>I'm not using an overly powerful Mac but it seems to do the job with editing MOVs and AVCHD files directly (mostly using preview renders). 60fps shots and other HD with effects applied start to make it crumple without rendering previews. It's a MacBook Pro 13"" 2.53Ghz Core 2 Duo, 8GB DDR3, 1TB internal 2.5"" drive (slow).</p>

<p>I intend to use ProRes or similar footage on an external 7200rpm FireWire drive.</p>
","<p>There's a philosophical difference between delivery codecs (e.g. mpeg4, avchd), editing codecs (e.g. DNxHD, ProRes, Cineform), and capture codecs (e.g. r3d, DVCPROHD).  While almost any codec can be used for each of these three stages, your workflow needs will help you decide which are best suited for each stage.</p>

<p>The question you seem to be asking, is ""Which editing codec should I transcode to for an online edit?"".  Editing codecs are generally less compressed and larger on disk, to make playback simpler from a processing perspective.  It's definitely possible to use ProRes in Premiere, and coming from DSLR (as of July 2011) 422 is probably (technically) overkill, but it is a reasonable default choice.  Another editing codec option to consider is Cineform, since you can get the 1920x1080 codec for free now, as part of the GoPro Cineform Studio package.</p>

<p>There are even specialized tools to help you with transcoding batches of files, such as Magic Bullet Grinder.  If you're concerned about editing speed, there's even a chance that Premiere and your computer will be powerful enough to slog through your capture files as-is without transcoding, saving you from this step altogether.</p>

<p>As always, try it for yourself, and test, test, test, your workflow before putting it into production.</p>

<li>Import your paths into after effects, pasting should also work with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. Requirement is to have all of your <strong>paths from Illustrator as seperate masks on the solid</strong> in After Effects.</li>
<li>Note: you can create seperate paths from an image of letters within After Effects with the <code>auto trace</code> option <em>(Layer > Auto Trace)</em> - use black and white option and set it to the current frame <em>(Note: Tracing letters isn't really accurate)</em></li>
<li>Apply the stroke effect to the solid layer which should be full of masks now</li>
<li>Tick <code>All Masks</code> option to make use of all masks</li>

"How to do a video live stream through a VPS?","6946","","<p>I've been looking at a million resources and I can't find a definitive answer to this. </p>

<p>I'm looking to do a small scale (max 50 viewers possibly), low quality live video stream, with nothing but my existing equipment (mac and firewire camera), a low end ubuntu vps and free software. Stream from the mac and host the stream on a website on the vps.</p>

<p>I don't want to use services like justin.tv or ustream because the advertising is very intrusive, and I'd also like to learn how to do it myself. 
I have some server admin skills, but this is a new world to me, and I can't make sense of how all the pieces fit together. I spent all night reading about rtmp, rec5, wowza, ffmpeg and now i don't understand anything at all. </p>

<p>Can someone give me possible workflows to piece the 3 parts together?ie, streaming from local computer, receiving in vps, broadcasting on website. </p>
","<p>It varies a little from one server to another, but the basic components are an encoder/streaming client on the local client that takes input from the camera and turns it in to a stream that can be sent to the stream server on the VPS.  </p>

<p>The job of the stream server (such as Red5) is then to provide a publishing point that relays the stream to viewers.  The streaming server can either pull from the client or the client can push to a target location on the stream server in order to provide content to the publishing point.</p>

<p>Each viewer then connects to the published RTMP stream on the streaming server and is provided with a copy of the stream that is being uploaded.  Note that every copy has to be sent out separately unless you are on a private network where you can use multicast, so bandwidth needs rise quickly, though it should be possible to do 50 SD or lower quality streams from a single VPS provided it has a reliable 100Mbps connection.</p>

<p>The website simply contains a viewer that hooks up to the RTMP (or similar) stream and is actually operating client side, not server side.</p>

<p><strong>So to quickly recap, client uploads to back end of streaming server, streaming server replicates out to every viewer requesting to watch it and the web server simply gives users a client side viewer that connects to the video stream.</strong></p>

<p>To briefly hit on what each one of the component you mentioned.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RTMP</strong> is real time media protocol, which is a common streaming protocol used for actually relaying the video stream content.</li>
<li><strong>Red5</strong> is a fairly popular free streaming media server software used for replicating out RTMP and similar media streams to clients.</li>
<li><strong>Wowza</strong> is another streaming media server software, however it is a commercial, paid software product.  If you are limited to free software, Wowza is not an option.</li>
<li><strong>FFMpeg</strong> is a popular open source video encoder.  It runs on the client and can be configured to publish a stream that can be sent to Red5 or similar streaming media server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you will need an end-point viewer capable of consuming the stream.  Software like Windows Media Player or Quicktime should be able to view a stream, but it is often best to include an embedded cross platform player in the website that people are going to for the stream.  There are many options for this component with different strengths and weaknesses, but any should work for your purposes.</p>

","<p>Peak file creation as well as creating alternate forms of various assets is perfectly normal background behavior for Premiere.  When you load new assets into a project, Premiere automatically starts a number of background processes to analyze the clip and make it easier for Premiere to do its job smoothly.</p>

<p>This should not cause any trouble and should not be a concern to you.  It is just the program functioning as it should.  It shouldn't cause any problems if you start working with it prior to completion of the work, but some functions may work more slowly or provide incomplete information while the processes are still going on.</p>

<p>Are there any applications when a refresh rate should be as high as possible?</p>
","<p>No, there is no practical limit that we know of yet to what would be best, there is however a practical limit to what we can capture and display.  </p>

<p>In tests with airforce pilots, subjects were able to <strong><em>identify</em></strong> a plane from being shown a frame for only 1/220th of a second.<a href=""http://www.100fps.com/how_many_frames_can_humans_see.htm"">1</a>  They eye is able to pull information out of extremely short periods of time, but unfortunately our eyes are also very good at concealing lack of information (which is actually why video works in the first place), so it is extremely hard (possibly impossible) to determine the actual point at which we wouldn't benefit from more information.</p>

<p>Either way, it is almost certainly upward of the current 1/600 mark and often theorized to be beyond the 1/1000 mark.  The problem comes not from how much information we present, but that we don't have enough information to present.  </p>

<p>Generally videos are normally not played back faster than 48 frames per second at the fastest and video games normally don't go beyond actually displaying 120 or so.  This is due to a lack of being able to store sufficient data and stream it in an efficient enough manner to display in an affordable manner.  </p>

<p>Instead, to make things appear more smoothly, the TV interpolates additional frames to fill the gaps.  It looks at where one frame is and where the next frame will be and generates frames in-between to smooth it out.  The problem is, not all motion is perfectly smooth and interpolation isn't a perfect process.  The result is that unnatural artifacts appear in the video which we can detect and end up being unsettling and eventually start causing more harm to the persistence of vision than the extra frames help.</p>

<p>This is why, when you move in to higher refresh rates it is sometimes better to use a lower setting without the interpolation.  Video is about simulating reality for your eyes.  In reality, there is no refresh rate, any time your eyes chose to process, they get whatever is there at the time.  Thus, higher and higher frame rates will more closely emulate reality as long as the information is actually based around reality rather than something invented by electronics on the fly.</p>

<p>Eventually, we may exceed the ""refresh rate"" of the eye, but as of yet, we don't definitively know what that is and are pretty certain we haven't hit it yet.</p>

<p>Or if that doesn't work for the composition you can use expressions. Here's how:  make your first matte layer, with its mask, and then duplicate it and put it over another of the layers you want to matte. Now with both matte layers selected press <strong>m</strong> to show the <strong>mask path</strong> property for both. Select only the new layer, and while holding <em>alt/option</em> click on the stopwatch next to the <strong>mask path</strong> property to add an expression to it. You'll see a pick-whip (the spiral thing) next to the expression. Click and drag the pick-whip to the <strong>mask path</strong> property of the original layer. It should say something like <strong>thisComp.layer(""the name of the original matte layer"").mask(""mask1"").maskPath</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6uGVI.png"" alt=""expression linking mask shapes"">
To make those layers follow the original matte layer they shoul be parented to it as well.</p>

<p>Of course the simpler, faster to render way is to precompose the matte layer on its own and use copies of that comp as your matte layers. Why was it you don't want to precomp?</p>

"Camera features useful when recording a live high school basketball game?","6344","","<p>What features should I be looking for in a camera (typically found in cameras less than $1000) for shooting a high school basketball game?  The intent is to use the video for ""Game Film"" type analysis (so picture quality for rebroadcasting purposes is not as important).  </p>

<p>Some things I have noticed already (borrowing cameras from friends) </p>

<ul>
<li>Tripod is very helpful</li>
<li>Most cameras wont cover the whole court (from top bleacher position) in a single shot. (Is there a feature of the camera or tripod that would make this less painful, wide angle?)</li>
<li>Long battery life (1.5 hours)</li>
</ul>
","<p>Generally I see four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>DSLR / system cam (e.g. Canon EOS, Sony Alpha)</li>
<li>Compact camera (e.g. Fuji Film)</li>
<li>Action cam (e.g. GoPro)</li>
<li>Camcorder (e.g. Samsung HMX or Sony HDR)</li>
</ul>

<p>Before talking about solutions I would propose to think about the requirements. The following topics come to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Field of view</strong> - Do you want to cover the whole field only, or do you also want to zoom in on single players? Camcorders and compact cams may be limited in wide angle but often offer great zoom. Action cams normally don't zoom at all. DSLR is most flexible with the right objectives, but zooming may not be as easy to operate as with camcorders. Some compact cams stop sound recording while zooming, if that's an issue.</li>
<li><strong>Light</strong> - I suspect it may be a little dark in the gym? So high ISO values and good quality at high ISO values may be important, especially when zooming in.</li>
<li><strong>Unattended operation</strong> - Do you need to leave the cam unattended? You'd probably wouldn't want to leave a DSLR unattended.</li>
<li><strong>Recording time</strong> - battery life time is helpfull, the option to record with power supply may be even better. Also some cams stop recording after some minutes (e.g. EOS 600D after 12 mins HD recording).</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong> - Many cameras focus on the nearest objects in their field of view. This could be the spectators, not the players. So the camera should offer a deep depth of focus, or the option to manually set the focus.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> - Do you need still images? Which would require you to set a short shutter time. High ISO values would be even more important then.</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - Where do you want to watch the recordings? If directly from the camera, you'll need an HDMI output or something similiar. Some Camcorder even offer an integrated beamer, so you could watch the recording directly in the fitting room without any further equipment. And you'll probably don't want to show the whole game, just parts of it? So you might want convenient fast-forward/rewind features. Some cams even offer very limited postprocessing capabilities, so you could cut away the uninteresting parts of the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A tripod may definitely be a good idea, but it needs its space. A smaller device to fix your camera to e.g. a fence may be even more appropriate (e.g. Gorilla pod). If you go for a tripod make sure it's high enough and strong enough to hold the weight of your cam.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory Card - it must be fast enough. If it's not, it may stop the recording in the middle of the game. How fast? Depends on the video format of your recording.</p></li>
<li><p>Replacement batteries</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Summary:
Assuming you don't want to zoom in and you want to leave the camera unattended somewhere, I tend to agree with AJ Henderson: An action cam might be the best way to go. Add a gorilla pod to fix the camera somewhere, get a big and fast memeory card and make sure the recording/battery life time fits your needs.
For more sophisticated use cases a Camcorder with integrated beamer, power supply, strong wide angle, high ISO plus a tripod may the right choice.</p>

"YouTube Compression: Why?","6301","","<p>There's a lot of advice on the internet on encoding settings to apply to your video before uploading to YouTube (<a href=""https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en"">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en</a>, <div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

            </div></div>, ...). They say that not only will compression allow your video to upload faster but it will make it look better when played back on YouTube (an example of this is at 0:18 in the YouTube link above). </p>

<p>What I also read is that YouTube re-encodes any video that you upload (example: ""Telestream Episode product manager Kevin Louden started by noting that YouTube re-encodes all video uploaded to the site"" - <a href=""http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Encoding-for-YouTube-How-to-Get-the-Best-Results-83876.aspx"">http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Encoding-for-YouTube-How-to-Get-the-Best-Results-83876.aspx</a>).</p>

<p>So the obvious question for me is if YouTube re-encodes anything that it's asked to upload, why should different codecs make a difference to final playback quality on YouTube? To get the best playback quality on YouTube, shouldn't I upload a lossless file and let YouTube compress it however it wants?</p>

<p>I don't care about upload time or file size, I just care about playback quality on YouTube.</p>
","<p>I've answered a similar question some time ago. YouTube added a few codecs since then but all the info there still applys: <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/5318/what-codec-will-my-youtube-uploads-be-output-in-and-what-codec-should-i-use-to-u/5715#5715"">How does YouTube encode my uploads and what codec should I use to upload?</a></p>

<p>Short answer: Yes if you are concerned about maximum quality a lossless codec or visually lossless codec is the way to go. Re-encoding always means loss of information if you re-encode with a lossy codec like h264.
Saying that videos will look better with compression is just a wrong statement.
Compression reduces file size, that's the only benefit you get from it. Best case you don't loose information with that compression but with most codecs like h264 you do because they discard information and re-arrange it in order to achieve a high compression.</p>

<p>Though different codecs do have an affect on the outcome, encoding a video with MPEG2 or h264 makes a huge difference. The former will usually have way more compression artifacts depending on your encoding settings than an h264 encoded video with similar bitrate.
So if your source is already having artifacts the second encode from YouTube won't make it look any better but worse.</p>

"How to fade in/out a video/audio clip with unknown duration?","6193","","<p>I'm working on a project where I'm using ffmpeg to batch convert some video files, and adding fade in/out effects at the head and tail of each clip.</p>

<p>I've been using this bit of code to add the fade/out effect on clips with known durations:</p>

<p><code>
ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -filter:v 'fade=in:0:30,fade=out:9650:30' -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -preset veryfast -c:a copy fadeInOut.mp4
</code></p>

<p>My two questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I simultaneously fade the audio in/out?</li>
<li>Can ffmpeg automatically figure out the duration of the clip and be told just fade out the last 30 frames?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>#1</strong> To simultaneously fade the audio in/out:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -vf 'fade=in:0:30,fade=out:960:30'
                   -af 'afade=in:st=0:d=1,afade=out:st=32:d=1'
       -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -preset veryfast fadeInOut.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>The afade times are in <em>seconds</em>.</p>

<p><strong>#2</strong> Automatically? No. But see workaround below</p>

<p>You can first run ffprobe to get duration.</p>

<pre><code>ffprobe -i clip.mp4 -show_entries stream=codec_type,duration -of compact=p=0:nk=1
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get something like this:</p>

<pre><code>video|13.556000
audio|13.816000
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use the above to place your fades. These times are in seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -sseof -1 -copyts -i clip.mp4 -filter_complex
       ""[1]fade=out:0:30[t];[0][t]overlay,fade=in:0:30[v];
        anullsrc,atrim=0:2[at];[0][at]acrossfade=d=1,afade=d=1[a]""
       -map ""[v]"" -map ""[a]"" -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -preset veryfast -shortest fadeInOut.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>FFmpeg has a <code>sseof</code> option that allows one to seek an input from the end. We can use that to accomplish our goal. So we feed the input twice, with the 2nd time ingesting only the last second. We tell FFmpeg to preserve the timestamps, so that ffmpeg preserves the temporal position of this tail portion. </p>

<p>We apply a fade out to this tail and then overlay the result onto the full input. Since they are the same media file, the foreground completely covers the background, and since <code>copyts</code> was applied, the overlay happens upon the corresponding identical frame in the background input.</p>

<p>For audio, we create a blank dummy audio of duration 2 seconds, and then apply an audio crossfade from the main audio to this dummy audio. Since the 2nd audio is blank, this is, in effect, a fade-out for the main input. The <code>-shortest</code> is added to leave out portions of the dummy audio after the crossfade has occurred.</p>

"Why is my video alternating between blurry and sharp?","6169","","<p>I notice this on a regular basis while watching videos I've downloaded. The image will alternate pretty quickly between blurry and sharp and sometimes the effect is quite drastic. Below is an example image of a tree and the difference between two frames.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/peOzz.jpg"" alt=""Two frames less than a second apart""></p>

<p><strong>What is this effect called and why does it happen</strong>? I'm fairly certain it has to do with compression but what is going on?</p>

<p>If you receive a video like this and there's nothing you can do with how it was rendered or processed, <strong>is there anything you can do after the fact to minimize the effect</strong>? Settings in your video player maybe?</p>

<p>This particular screen shot was taken in Windows Media Player on Windows 7 playing an AVI file. The effect is still visible in VLC and I first noticed this while playing video through my PS3 off a harddrive. I can't say for sure, but I'm fairly certain that it's happened on multiple file types as well.</p>
","<p>The effect that you've seen is a side effect of the compression algorithm that was used to encode the video.</p>

<p>The most common compression algorithms (MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 among them) compress different frames with different methods, and that is why two very close and relatively similar frames may look so different.</p>

<p>The frame that looks pretty good is likely a <em>keyframe</em>. This is a frame that has all its pixels represented in the encoded stream. The compression introduces some loss of quality, but since the whole image is encoded the result typically looks good.</p>

<p>The image that looks bad is a frame that is not fully represented in the encoded stream. To make videos smaller, for certain parts of the picture the encoder references parts of previous frames that the player/decoder keeps stored in memory, so only the parts that are different are stored for the frame. Because of this these frames end up being a sort of collage. If the bitrate is too low, then you end up with really washed up images like the one you show. But increasing the bitrate enough helps dissimulate this effect, to the point that it is barely or not noticeable. Consider that all the TV that you watch (digital over the air, satellite, FIOS, cable, etc.) is encoded in this way.</p>

<p>For MPEG-2 it is common practice to insert a keyframe in the stream every half a second (15 frames for 29.97fps video, 12 frames for 25fps). For H.264 sometimes they go even longer than half a second.</p>

<p>In general, the image quality of a compressed video is at its highest at the keyframe points, and then slowly starts to degrade, going up again with the next keyframe.</p>

<p>For a more detailed explanation of frame types used in compression algorithms see the Wikipedia article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_compression_picture_types"" rel=""nofollow"">Video compression picture types</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a player cannot improve the quality of the video, since the problem is that the information to reproduce the frame with better quality isn't there. The only ways to address this is by increasing the bitrate when encoding and/or increase the number of keyframes. </p>

<p>On the player side I think the only thing you can do is play the video in a smaller window, so then these artifacts will be less visible.</p>

","<p>The first thing that I noticed is that your camera is delivering <code>yuv422p</code> - which isn't bad in and of itself, but you could try forcing it to yuv420 by adding <code>-pix_fmt yuv420p</code> to your command. (This is nice if you ever plan on displaying your video on anything that isn't linux.)</p>

"After effects: Moving text along 3D path","5606","","<p>After Effects beginner here.</p>

<p>The effect I'm after is where text is appearing from behind an object. So far, I'm using the position and rotation parameters.</p>

<p>But the text is rigid. I found something about having text along a path which is what I want except I haven't found out how to work it in 3D.</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far. I need the text to look like it's bending as it comes around the ... well, bend!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwTdy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>to accomplish this, we need to cheat something. I assume you are trying to do something like this in the following image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9tzNo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ol>
<li>First, create a camera in your comp (i see you already have one)</li>
<li>Then create a text layer and make it 3D (you have this as well)</li>
<li>Select your layer and select <code>Ellipse tool (Q)</code> but do not apply
anything.</li>
<li>While your text layer selected, double click the Ellipse tool in
your toolbar. This will create a circular mask on your text layer.</li>
<li>Rotate your Text layer -90 degrees on X Axis.</li>
<li>Twirl down the controls of the Text layer and under Text controls
you will see <code>Path Options</code>. In these options select your mask. And
change your settings as you wish.</li>
<li>Now expand all the controls of that layer. There you will see a text
label <code>Animate:</code> with a small circled arrow.</li>
<li>Select Enable Per-character 3D.</li>
<li>Then in the same menu, select Rotation.</li>
<li>There will be an <code>Animator 1</code> section, expand it and change the X
 Rotation to 90 degrees.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now check with your camera, orbit around, you should see your text bends through your mask.</p>

<p>To animate this text along that path, get back to the <code>Path Options</code>. Keyframe the <code>First Margin</code> option or add an expression by <code>Alt+Left Click</code>, and add this value and edit as you like:</p>

<pre><code>time * 500
</code></pre>

<p>This will get the current frame and multiply it with 500 and give this value to <code>First Margin</code> property.</p>

"Which is better quality, a larger 480p video or a smaller 1080p video?","5533","","<p>On the Internet, I sometimes see lower resolution videos that have a larger file size than a higher resolution version.</p>

<p>Which of these should have a better apparent quality when displayed on a 50'' FHD TV?
A 4GB 480p or a 2GB 1080p ???</p>
","<p>Well you CAN make rough assumptions. For a live action film a bit-rate of 3-8 Mbit/s is very advisable at 1080p. At 3Mbit/s you will very likely have noticable artifacts, thats usually an advisable bitrate for 720p video.
A file at SD resolution 480p/567p that is around 4GB in size you probably deal with a DVD that wasn't trans-coded for archiving.</p>

<p>Which is better is hard to say though, in case of a DVD encode you probably have MPEG2 or MPEG4-v2 encoded video and with HD/Blu-ray you will very likely have h264 which is more efficent than MPEG2/MPEG4-v2/Xvid (h264 is MPEG4-v10). So a low bitrate with h264 is not as bad as a low bitrate with MPEG2/MPEG4-v2/Xvid.</p>

<p>Generally I would probably go with the 1080p with less bitrate if its smaller in size, just because its smaller in size and its very likely that on a 1080p monitor/TV the video will not look worse than the upscaled DVD.</p>

"How can I seamlessly loop with turbulent displace filter in AE?","5509","","<p>Please have a look at my website <a href=""http://www.solstice.co.il"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">solstice.co.il</a> on a chrome browser.

<p>The problem is that because of the fractal nature of the effect, I could not find a way to seamless loop the animation, which led me to resort in an ugly cross-dissolve. </p>

<p>How can I create a more pleasing seamless loop with this effect?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>I've redone the animation manually using the puppet tool, which is closer to what I wanted but not perfect, so the question still stands. The old animation for reference can be found here:

","<p>In order to get a fluid and seamless loop, it's key to <strong>enable Cycle Evolution</strong> and <strong>move the last keyframe 1 frame beyond the end</strong> of the composition.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the <strong>Turbulent Displace</strong> Effect onto the footage</li>
<li>Open up <strong>Evolution Options</strong></li>
<li>Enable <strong>Cycle Evolution</strong> </li>
<li>Go to the <strong>first frame</strong> in the timeline</li>

<li><p>Go to the <strong>last frame</strong> in the timeline and set the <strong>Evolution Times</strong> value to <code>1x</code>, this is equal to 360 degree (one revolution)</p></li>
<li><p>Move the second keyframe <strong>1 frame beyond the end</strong> of the composition:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/47sEr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>

<h3>Example</h3>

<li>First evolution keyframe value: <code>0x</code> at frame <code>0</code></li>
<li>Second evolution keyframe value: <code>1x</code> at frame <code>51</code></li>

"How to parent a mask to another element in AfterFX?","5502","","<p>I have this video whereby text is revealed one letter after another. A text cursor is moving along with each letter to simulate the fact of writing the text on a word processor.</p>

<p>I have separate animations for the text being revealed: a mask expands, for the cursor: the position. Keyframes are aligned and the animation is linear.</p>

<p>However, the cursor is overlapping the text at the start of the animation as you can see here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/evbit.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I also tried adding a solid layer that moves with the text and hiding everything to the right of the cursor. That works except when the background is not a solid color as is my case.</p>

<p>So my question is if I can parent the mask's movement to the cursor, or vice-versa? Alternatively, is there a better way to do it?</p>
","<p>At the moment parenting a mask or its vertices to another object like a null is not possible by default. Although it is <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/aftereffects/2012/12/top-feature-requests-for-after-effects-in-2012.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one of the most wanted features</a>, probably there is no official solution for this. But in the same link you can find a link to a forum post where scripting master Dan Ebberts <a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/thread/881618"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">offers a solution</a>. This solution has some limitations though, yet it might work in your project.</p>

<p>My solution would be more manual, this is not the fastest way but it works. If you are using a text layer, try adding an animator for the opacity, based on the characters.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8uZHI.png"" alt=""Screenshot""></p>

<p>Then animate your cursor layer's position accordingly. Or better, parent it to a null and animate your null and use hold keyframes.</p>

<p>This option is better than animating a mask on text layers, as it reveals each character. In your screenshot, there is this situation that your letters are revealed as if a linear wipe is used.</p>

"Can H264 achieve ""equivalence"" with ProRes 422?","5487","","<p>Has anyone done or seen any tests comparing Apple ProRes 422 with high-bitrate H.264?</p>

<p>We use 422 as a delivery format to go to DCP for theatrical versions of trailers.
The bitrate is around 150mbps.</p>

<p>We are wondering if it is possible to reach adequate quality with H.264. Say, with bitrates of 50-100mbps, and tweaking the GOP size/structure. (E.g., only using ""I"" frames.)</p>

<p>Assuming H264 is a more ""efficient"" codec, we are hoping to get smaller file sizes.</p>

<p>Or does H.264 just not have the color depth to compete?</p>

<p>It would be great to see if someone has done some real-world testing.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I just did a quick test using 50mbps, GOP size 1, I-frames only ... and ""by eye"" I see no difference whatsoever. Same level of noise, same colors. The ProRes is 1.92GB, the H264 is 566MB. How would one ""test"" the difference technically? Or measure the color information?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I did some more testing ... with Adobe Media Encoder, using MPEG2, and the ""4:2:2"" profile, the ProRes file went from <strong>1,920MB to 290MB</strong>! And I would say, subjectively, that is is 99% as good. This is remarkable. (With H264 I was down to 500-700MB)</p>
","<p>Well going by the numbers h264 has a lesser bit-depth and color accuracy than ProRes 422. PR422 has 10bit and 4:2:2 chroma sub-sampling, h264 has 8bit and 4:2:0 unless you encode in the Hi422P Intra profile which isn't very well supported in the wild but offers 10bit and 4:2:2.
So in that case I don't think you will have any difference what so ever between the two formats but a better compression ratio than with ProRes.</p>

<p>E: If you want to go real ape shit you can also encode in the 4:4:4 Intra Profile, that supports up to 14 bit of color depth. So technically superior to ProRes4444. Though you probably wont find any commercial application that supports it.</p>

<p>On another note, I don't think content delivery for cinema should be done in h264 nor ProRes 422 especially when you plan to encode to a lossless codec (JPEG2000/DCP) afterwards. It just doesn't make much sense to do so, all you loose is quality even though there is no need to do so, you only save space until you encode your DCP. There are other good lossless codecs, that offer very good compression, to use before encoding the DCP.</p>

<p>You could for example go directly to DCP, the Adobe Media Encoder offers export to 2k DCP since CC 2014, you can skip an encoding step and have a lossless codec with very good compression ratio.</p>

<p>Another great intermediate codec is <a href=""http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Ut-Video-Codec-Suite"" rel=""nofollow"">UtVideo</a> aswell as <a href=""http://diracvideo.org/schrodinger-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">Schrödinger</a> (an implementation of the Dirac codec from BBC, its available through <a href=""https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">FFmpeg</a>).</p>

<p>In the end though theory always differs from practice and if you don't deliver for nation wide cinemas with excellent projectors and what not, that quality difference in your delivery chain will be neglectable.
The only thing that could be pitfall is that h264 is very complex an by that always prone for some weird visual defects, so final inspection is always a necessity with h264.</p>

","<p>The program panel's sequence preview is mainly determined by the sequence settings. You can change those via <strong>Sequence</strong> → <strong>Sequence Settings</strong>.

<p>FFmpeg isn't hard to use and not all too different from the Handbrake CLI.
The advantage you have with FFmpeg is a lot more formats you can output to and read from and you have the option to use many advanced filters on your video aswell as audio:<br>

","<p>If the result of increasing the frame rate is that more pixels are displayed per second, then yes, keeping the bit rate the same will almost certainly mean a loss in overall quality. Not all such losses are objectionable or even necessarily noticeable. For example, if the bit rate is 30 Mb/s and you reduce it to 15 Mb/s, probably not many people would notice.</p>

"How can I stitch together several m2ts video files into one large file?","5275","","<p>I have recorded several community theater productions with a Panasonic TM900 camera. The settings on the camera were to record at 1080p @ 60 FPS.  However, I noticed that the camera produces  several video files (.m2ts). </p>

<p>While the included Panasonic HD Editor software plays the videos seamlessly that is not the case with other video players such as Windows Media Player.</p>

<p>I want to be able stitch together two or more m2ts video files without losing the quality of the original footage. What software should I use to do this? I do not need fancy editing capabilities though I would like to cut some scenes from the video such as during the play's intermission.</p>

<p>Open source software or at least free software is preferred but commercial software is not out of the question if it works well and it is easy to use.</p>
","<p>I believe you can join MPEG ts (transport stream) files simply by joining them together.  In Linux:</p>

<pre><code>cat file1.m2ts file2.m2ts file3.m2ts &gt; joined_file.m2ts

<p>In Windows/DOS:</p>

<pre><code>copy /b file1.m2ts + file2.m2ts + file3.m2ts joined_file.m2ts /b

<p>As long as the input files are split properly, and each new file begins with a key frame (and I would expect your camera does this), this should work just fine. And even if your camera is not careful about splitting right before a keyframe (again, I'd be surprised if it doesn't), as long as you re-join in the exact same order, it ought to work.</p>

"How can I make professional video using an iPad?","5219","","<p>I am willing to make an educational guidance video. And since I want to make it using an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad"" rel=""nofollow"">iPad</a>, what things should I keep in mind?</p>

<p>And which specific camera app will be better over the inbuilt camera app? With that how could I improve audio quality of my video?</p>
","<p>Trade in the iPad and buy a desktop or laptop that you can edit on.  You will not produce professional results entirely on an iPad.  I am not aware of any good video editing options for iPad, certainly none of the big names have a product available.  There simply isn't enough horsepower on a tablet to perform the hard, complex operations involved in video editing in a smooth and timely manner. </p>

<p><em>(Minor correction: There is a version of iMovie available and Pinnacle does have a video editor available as well.  These are both makers of some of the better consumer focused stuff and could be considered big names, particularly since Pinnacle was previously held by Avid for a while, but I would still consider these cumbersome and limiting.  It probably <strong>IS</strong> possible to produce a professional quality result, but you'd have to work really hard at it.)</em> </p>

<p>You could use the iPad for shooting the video and get decent results with proper usage, but you will still need a lot of other equipment to compensate for the iPad's camera short comings.  </p>

<p>Lighting will be super important.  You will need lots of light, placed well so that there is sufficient light for the sensor and no shadows that the camera's dynamic range can't deal with.  This is also more than just having lamps, but also the stands to position them where you need them and modifiers to adjust the way the light falls on the scene to make good, even lighting.</p>

<p>Sound will also be another issue.  You will want an external mic.  People <a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/audio/tips-solutions/using-usb-microphone-ipad"" rel=""nofollow"">have reported</a> being able to use USB mics with the iPad Camera Connection Kit, but I couldn't find anything verifying if it would work with professional audio interfaces or a microphone more designed for video situations.  Another option (which is what you will commonly see in more professional productions) is to use a separate audio recorder, such as a Zoom h4n to record audio and sync it up in post production.  Even if you really wanted to stick with your plan to use the iPad for the editing, you could transfer the files off the SD card using the previously mentioned camera connection kit.</p>

<p>You will also need a stand and tripod that can hold the iPad securely.  There are numerous options available and I don't have any particular experience with any particular model, but being able to shoot stable smooth video is an absolutely critical aspect of any high quality video shoot.  If you shot is purely static, you might be able to prop it up like Jason suggested, though it also then runs the risk of slipping or more easily getting jostled, and as he points out, you won't be able to do a shot with any movement, so I'd highly recommend a tripod.</p>

<p>If you can handle those three things, that should allow for decent quality footage to be shot on the iPad, but you are probably looking at between $450 ($200 dirt cheap lighting, $50 tripod adapter, $50 dirt cheap tripod, $100 - $150 relatively cheap usb consumer audio mic) and $1300+ ($500 ok lighting, $250 basic pro audio recorder, $150-$200 decent video mic, $50 tripod adapter, $250-$350 ok tripod) of gear to supplement it.</p>

<p>I want to emphasis that the $450 is about the cheapest you could possibly go while still calling it ""professional video"".  You can make something that looks ok for a consumer project for less, but really pulling off professional video is unfortunately not particularly cheap even if costs have dropped like a rock in the last 10 to 15 years.  (You can now do for $15,000 what used to cost $150,000+.)</p>

<p>Finally, practice and experience is key.  There is more to producing professional results than the right equipment, you also need to know how to use it properly.  There is far too much to doing this to summarize in a single QA post, but pre-planning is really key.  If you know your shots and plan the video out before you shoot, you can make sure you get all the shots you need and make sure that they flow well from one to the next.  You can plan the angles to shoot from and what you want the end product to look for.  Even with hundreds of thousands of dollars of high end professional gear, the result will look like someone's home movies without planning and organization to accomplish a consistent vision for the video.</p>

"Video converted by FFMPEG has a different duration, why?","5105","","<p>I convert videos using FFMPEG. My goal is to convert them to the MP4 container format (<em>MPEG-4 Part 14</em>) with <em>AAC</em>-encoded audio stream and <em>MPEG-4 part 10</em>-encoded video stream.</p>

<p>I use the following line to convert the videos:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -y -i ""{inputFile}"" ""{outputFile}""
</code></pre>

<p>The converted video looks fine, however the duration of streams in the converted file and the input file doesn't always match.</p>

<p>I've made some experiments and the difference in the duration is undoubtedly there, however, it is not that much - anyway I'm testing with small videos.
Here are my results:</p>

<pre><code>| InputFile  | InputAudio | InputVideo | OutputAudio | OutputVideo  |
|------------|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| h.avi      | 3s 631ms   | 3s 567ms   | 3s 668ms    | 3s 567ms     |
| h.flv      | 3s 631ms   | 3s 558ms   | 3s 668ms    | 3s 567ms     |
| h.mov      | 3s 532ms   | 3s 533ms   | 3s 682ms    | 3s 534ms     |
| h.mp4      | 3s 605ms   | 3s 534ms   | 3s 682ms    | 3s 567ms     |
| h.mpg      | 3s 605ms   | 3s 533ms   | 3s 563ms    | 3s 534ms     |

</code></pre>

<p>Since I would build a software on the top of FFMPEG, I would be happier if I could at least understand the reason of this difference. Is it because of some unnecessary transcoding?</p>

<p>In this case, can I turn this transcoding off to prevent FFMPEG to resample my input video file?</p>

<p>If I cannot turn it off, how can I be sure (besides testing) that this difference is not proportional to the size of the video?</p>

<p>If I convert for example a 10-hour video, a difference of multiple seconds or even minutes is not suitable for me.</p>
","<p>Hope this explanation is what you're looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you transcode to an encoding such as H.264 (MPEG-4 part 10) you necessarily also resample the video, that's part of H.264 compression technique. Nontheless, I doubt if this is the reason you experience a timing gap since the resampling doesn't necessarily influence the clock rate of the media. So, I wouldn't worry too much about resampling, it can cause some variance, but probably very marginal.</p></li>
<li><p>The container formats you listed are kinda irrelevant, because they define how the compressed stream is packaged, whereas the the source of the timing difference is the compression itself. The <code>.flv</code> file, for example, may contain a stream encoded by the legacy Flash Sorenson codec or the newer H.264. In the first case you would be transcoding the video stream, but in the latter it is possible the you're not - depending on the audio codec used. The <code>.avi</code> and <code>.wmv</code> containers are codec agnostic, so there's no way of even guessing their content's encoding.</p></li>
<li><p>You didn't mention how the duration was tested. Note that ffmpeg by default shows you the duration that appears in the file's <strong>metadata</strong> and not a computed value. If your list is based on the data that ffmpeg dumps as part of its splash notices then you should note that this is explicitly <strong>metadata</strong> and not an actual measured value.</p></li>
<li><p>The delta in the durations you presented are within the range of one or two frames in a 25 or 30 fps range. It is reasonable for codecs to pad-with or strip-from streams blank frames according to their algorithm (or developer's tidiness...). It shouldn't influence timestamping when you properly concatenate streams.</p></li>
<li><p>There are only two reasons I can think of that can substantially change your media's duration, neither applicable in your specific case:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Re-encoding at a different target speed. Sometimes this happens unintentionally due to bad metadata in the input file. But not in your case, which, as noted above, correspond with a single frame dropped or gained.</p></li>
<li><p>When you apply a codec that recreates either stream. Examples include ad-stripping, silence detection, noise cleansing, etc.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, if you are concerned what's gonna happen with a 10-hour video - just run an actual test. If you run into trouble and seek assistance then keep in mind to post the input file's codec details and the method that you measured the stream duration.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Either of these codecs will give you good decoding speed, and both will work with Vegas and After Effects.  Any workflow that involves transcoding and not capturing natively to your editing codec (such as with ProRes on an Arri Alexa or a Cinedeck), is going to sacrifice time for processing, but in your case, it seems like that's a necessity. </p>

","<p>Let me explain you from scratch.</p>

<p>MOV,MP4,AVI,MKV etc all these are just containers, It is just kind of wrapper which contains audio,video,text,metadata file together as one file. It does not play much role in size of file. </p>

<p>Size of the file heavily depends on audio and video codec and bit-rate of that audio video codecs.</p>

<p>So there is possibility for file size reduction during conversion.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong>  Reduce in video codec bitrate. While converting video if default/changed bitrate of video codec is less than source file, than it will lead to reduction in file size as well as quality for sure.[ May not be perceivable by eye ] </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Change video codec. While converting video if change video codec to advance video codec of the stream, than it will reduce size but quality will not be degraded.</p>

<p>For example : 
Video codec of source file is MPEG-2 with bit-rate 20mbps and during conversation we convert to H264/AVC with bitrate 10mbps it will have same quality with half of the size. </p>

<p>So, Below are the popular video codecs generation and improvement.</p>

<p>MPEG-2 <strong>-></strong> H264 (40-50% bitrate reduction than MPEG-2) <strong>-></strong> H265/HEVC (40-50% bitrate reduction than H264) </p>

<p>Though the more advance codecs are computationally expensive during video playback. e.g H65 is ~300% more computationally expensive than H264.</p>

<p>During video conversation point 1. &amp; 2. both can be applied </p>

<p>You can view details of audio/video file can be see using free tool mediainfo <a href=""https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download</a>

"Why don't phones correct vertical filming?","4865","","<p>Many people get really mad at filmers suffering from the <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vertical-video-syndrome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vertical Video Syndrome</a> and I find it hard to disagree. Phone-shot videos filmed vertically are really annoying to watch. </p>

<p>But there's one thing I really don't get; why doesn't the phone correct that? The lens itself is always perfectly round and obviously doesn't really have an up- or downside. As far as I can imagine, shooting every video as if the phone was held horizontally would just be a formality in the software.</p>

<p>Is there any reason why that's never implemented? Is there any use in vertical filming? </p>
","<p>There is indeed no technical limitation that would prevent us from preventing vertical videos in software. The issue is more of an UX/usability problem.
While the sensor would allow us to capture virtually any part of it (video has usually always a lower resolution than the sensor can provide, when making videos the phone just records a small portion of the sensor area) we kind of don't want an auto correcting orientation as its rather unintuitive. The emphasize is on kind of.</p>

<p>Your phone screen is 9:16 so in order to show 16:9 video on your phone screen you either need to turn your phone by 90° or show the video with giant black bars on the top and bottom, which would be very annoying when recording a video. It's quite unintuitive to record horizontally while in a vertical position, so from a UX design perspective you would say the user wants to shoot vertically when holding its phone vertically because thats what you would usually expect your phone to act like.
Hold it vertical you shoot vertical, hold it horizontal you shoot horizontal, a pretty intuitive concept.</p>

<p>Though its still no reason to not at least implement an option to auto correct this and my guess why phone manufacturers aren't doing this is probably largely due to increased engineering costs in the camera module (afaik it can't be done purely in software, you would probably need to alter the functionality of your camera module a bit).</p>

<p>Users who shoot vertically don't really care about the fact that they have a horrible aspect ratio as they mostly just watch their video on a phone anyway. Vine is a good example for that, it really promotes doing vertical video because the aspect ratio of the device that your video will be watched on most of the time has the same vertical aspect ratio.
So the demand isn't really that huge so far to warrant such a feature but I'm certain we will see this at some point.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a lower end desktop in particular is going to have slow hard drives and may not have sufficient power to decode the file on the fly, thus resulting in lag during playback.  Based on the quality level you describe, data retrieval from disk is most likely the problem you are experiencing.  So now with some groundwork set, lets move on to your direct questions.</p>

<p>1) It isn't necessary to convert video you shoot from your T3i.  It's a standard format and will play or be editable on any system capable of playing it.  If you are having issues with the H264 playback lagging on a particular system, you can try converting it to a lower data rate or less CPU/Memory intensive compression. </p>

<p>Either of these options might make the issue worse if you go in the wrong direction (for example, most algorithms that are less CPU intense take more space and vice versa, so if you were CPU limited and you use a higher compression, it might be more jumpy).  You can also simply sacrifice quality to make it play faster and take less space, but this isn't really ideal.</p>

<p>2) Any good transcoder can do the job.  The files that come off the camera are generally pretty high quality and thus should transcode well.  Your choice of encoder depends a lot on the platform you are on.  FFMPEG(MPEG based formats, including H264) isn't that user friendly, but is freely available and works cross platform.  Other options include the free Windows Media Encoder(WMV) on Windows, Quicktime(several formats) on Mac or Windows, Adobe Media Encoder(numerous formats) on Mac or Windows or Microsoft Expression Encoder(WMV).  </p>

<p>The basic key for quality conversion is to keep the native resolution (number of pixels) in the video and use a high enough data rate to support the quality.  VBR 2 pass is better than VBR 1 pass which is generally better than Constant Bit Rate, but each takes more time than the latter to encode.</p>

<p>3) Video is BIG.  Really, REALLY, BIG.  Since the camera needs to record fast, fairly limited compression is used.  It sounds like you are probably using All I frame video which is fairly high data rate video.  Keep in mind that you are effectively storing 24 pictures every second, continuously.  If it was truly uncompressed, it would go even faster.  RAW, uncompressed HD video produces 261 megabytes of information PER SECOND! (14 bits per color, 3 colors, 1920 x 1080 pixels per picture, 24 pictures a second.)  Makes 10 minutes on a 4GB card sound a lot better doesn't it?  </p>

<p>If you don't need as high of a quality, you can use IBP frame video which will drastically reduce (about 1/5 to 1/6 the size) the amount of space required though it also drops the quality of the video.</p>

"Display multiple clips in DaVinci Resolve 12","4695","","<p>I'm very new to DaVinci Resolve and I'm still trying to figure out what DaVinci Resolve is good at and for what effects I should use other software.</p>

<p>The result I want to achieve is to see multiple clips at the same time (in the render product, not only while editing). Each quarter of the screen should show another clip.</p>

<p>My approach is hardly satisfying:
To achieve that I tried to have a video in a video.
I resized the first clip and made it small. But that makes the rest of the screen black and I couldn't find out how make the black part transparent in order to show another resized clip.</p>

<p>There must be an easier way (though my approach should work, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to replace a green screen). Any suggestions?</p>

<p><em>BTW</em>: Where can I learn such basic things? There must be a place to go.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm aware of the <code>split screen</code> feature, but this is not what I was looking for (because it splits the screen only to let the user compare different color versions).</p>
","<p>You are on The right track! There is not a specific effect to accomplish what you want to achieve.  </p>

<p>The only way (unless there is a 3rd party plugin, I don't know about) is to stack the 4 clips on separate tracks in the edit tab. Select one of them open the inspector (panel on the top right of the edit page) scale down and adjust the placement.  The video clip on the video track below should become visible. </p>

<p>[Added by Michael Tiemann as a friendly amendment: In the panel where the scaling information is displayed, there are also parameters for the anchor point.  By default, images are scaled from the center, which means you have to add in X and Y offsets to get each clip going to each corner.  Instead, you can set the upper left anchor point to be the upper left corner of the video, the upper right to be the upper right, etc.  Then, when you scale, each video clip will retreat to its own corner.  If you want to animate this effect, you can have one clip expand from its corner and go fullscreen by scaling back to 100%, and you can return it to its corner by scaling down to 50%.]</p>

"How do I decide if 14ms response time in IPS LCD monitor enough?","4679","","<p>I was considering buying an IPS LCD monitor (<a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=24-005-364"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>; though <strong>the question is generic</strong>).</p>

<p>It lists the response time of 14ms.</p>

<p><strong>How do I judge if that is enough?</strong></p>

<p>I am slightly concerned since some of NewEgg reviews for that monitor mention issues with playback of movies, but I'm not sure if their attributing the problems to the response time is the correct call. Researching online (TomsHardware forums, Yahoo answers, some other forums) keeps giving contradictory answers, some say don't go above 5ms, some say 14 is enough unless you do FPS sensitive high end games.</p>

<p>The intended usages of the monitor include light fare (productivity, web browsing, Youtube, some light gaming where FPS isn't an issue; and - what seems to be the most taxing to me LCD wise - watching movies encoded as DivX or MP4, with resolutions between 720p and 1080p).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there danger with ghosting or any other image issues due to 14ms response time given such usage patterns?</p></li>
<li><p>What other things may need to be considered that would either mitigate or exacerbate the response time?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A second sub-question is whether this response time will become a serious problem if the user of LCD becomes interested in some light video editing (it's a child, so nothing professional).</p>
","<p>At 14ms, you can still get an effective 71 frames per second.  It should be fine for working with video.  The frames might not show up exactly at the start of their time interval, but it still should be ok.  </p>

<p>Faster response is still better, but it isn't going to be critical for anything other than really high frame rate gaming.  5ms is very VERY fast for a high end screen.  Cheap screens go faster because they use simple techniques that are fast and cheap but produce (greatly) inferior image quality.  Better screens like IPS and PVA are by nature slower and the last time I was seriously in the market (which was a couple years ago), 6 to 8ms was considered fast for an IPS or PVA.  sub-5 is completely unnecessary.  14ms is probably on the slower end, but should still be fine.  Even 20ms would likely be ok, though it might start getting more noticeable.</p>

<p>As far as if ghosting would be an issue, at 71 refreshes per second, a frame won't be able to off by more than 1/3 or so of a frame.  That's 1/90th or so of a second, so would be pretty minor.  It might make for a slight stutter, but isn't that likely to be noticeable.  I think most of the arguments against it come from the faster is better mantra and the twitch reflex crowd.  You might or might not be able to notice the difference, but it shouldn't be a significant problem and I'd personally much rather have a good quality display with a slower refresh than a display I can only view from one exact angle and even then have color differences from the angle of one eye to the other, but have ""crisp"" frame rendering.</p>

","<p>For the GoPros with wifi (Hero3, Hero3+ or HD Hero/HD Hero 2 with a wifi bacpac), yes it is possible. They essentially work as a web server, so you can connect to that, and control the camera. It seems this is not officially documented anywhere, but a number of people have figured out how it works.</p>

<p>So turn on the wifi on the camera, then you can connect to it from your computer.

"Are there only a few standard video frame rates?","4536","","<p>In modern digital video, can a video file be marked with any arbitrary frame rate? Or are only a few specific frame rates widely supported? By ""modern"" I mean software players like Quicktime, VLC, Roku, game consoles, etc. I'm curious both what the video standards themselves say are allowed frame rates and then what actually works in practice.</p>

<p>I understand that 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps, 50 fps, and 60 fps are widely supported standards. HandBrake also offers 5, 10, and 15; are those standard options? Could I use any FPS number I want?  And what about the non-integer rates like 23.976 and 29.97; are they actually treated differently by software than 24 and 30? Also I see references to ""variable frame rate"" in H.264 streams; does that actually work and if so, what uses it?</p>

<p>My specific question is what the best way is to encode some 8mm film scans. The source is 16 fps, the 8mm film standard. Right now I'm doubling every other frame to bring it up to 24 fps which works OK, but I'm wondering why I can't just mark the video as 16 fps. FWIW I've produced H.264 mp4 files with Handbrake at 15 fps and found they only played back correctly in VLC. Mac Quicktime played them too fast, probably 24 fps.</p>
","<p>There are several ""standard"" frame rates, but there are getting to be so many that supporting arbitrary framerates is easier than specifically supporting many specific ones.  This is especially true for software players, like VLC.</p>

<p>More and more support exists for VARIABLE fps.  (VFR, variable frame rate).  This is where the interval between frames within the same video isn't a constant.  Many video container file formats (like Matroska (<code>.mkv</code>) or MPEG-4 (<code>.mp4</code>, closely related to Apple's <code>.mov</code>)) don't even store a FPS number, but rather a time base (e.g. 1/30th of a second), and then each frame has a timestamp as a multiple of that time base.  It just so happens that the interval between each frame is one or a small integer number of units of the time base in a CFR (constant frame rate) video.</p>

<p>Security-camera footage with near-duplicate frames dropped would be an obvious use-case for VFR.  Even moreso if it's being compressed with a simplistic video codec that doesn't take good advantage of temporal redundancy (with inter (p and b) frames).  (play around with <code>ffmpeg -vf mpdecimate</code> to drop near-dup frames.  Use <code>-vsync 2</code> if outputting to mp4, because for some reason it isn't the default for that muxer, but it is for mkv.)</p>

<p>Another case is modern smartphones.  For example, my brother's Moto G (2nd gen) records VFR videos.  It lowers the frame rate when the sensor needs more light.  Some of the output from running mediainfo on an mp4 created by the phone's software, recorded indoors:</p>

<pre><code>Bit rate                                 : 9 999 Kbps
Width                                    : 1 280 pixels
Height                                   : 720 pixels
Display aspect ratio                     : 16:9
Rotation                                 : 90°
Frame rate mode                          : Variable
Frame rate                               : 16.587 fps
Minimum frame rate                       : 14.985 fps
Maximum frame rate                       : 30.030 fps
</code></pre>

<p>Playback of a single VFR video stream is not hard.  The software just gets the next frame ready to display, sleeps until it should be displayed, then wakes up and displays it.</p>

<p>Things get a bit more complicated when you take into account the fact that humans can only see video frames when a monitor displays them.  VFR monitors exist, but are still rare.  (google for g-sync freesync).</p>

<p>Changing the displayed image while it's being scanned out to the monitor results in ugly tearing of the video (commonly seen when playing a game with vsync off).  This limits a player to changing the displayed image at 50 or 60Hz.  (CRTs support arbitrary vrefresh rates, within a range, but it's complicated to cook up modes with all the timings correct, so most people just used a few fixed refresh rates.  And now people have LCDs which only support a fixed refresh rate anyway.  Until freesync monitors are more widespread anyway.  I'm really looking forward to that. :)</p>

<p>So with video frame rates that aren't a multiple or a factor of the monitor refresh rate, some frames will be displayed for 3 monitor refreshes, and some for 2, for example, even if the video is meant to be at a constant 25FPS (on a 60Hz monitor).</p>

<p>Things get more complicated when you want to work with multiple clips and fade between them, or picture-in-picture, or various other effects.  It's a LOT easier to write video editting software if you can assume that all the clips have a new frame at the same time.  (They force clip alignment to snap to whole frames).</p>

<p>This is why NLEs (like kdenlive or pitivi, to pick random Free software examples), are more likely to force you to a fixed FPS, and drop/duplicate frames from your clips to make them match that frame rate.  The CFR you choose can be arbitrary, but it typically has to be constant for the whole ""project"".</p>

<p>(Do any NLEs fully work with VFR clips, and produce VFR output in that case?)</p>

<p>So in summary, once we have variable-sync monitors and OSes, the only thing holding us back will be video editting, I guess.  And broadcasting, since apparently CFR is a big deal for that, too?</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, the 29.970 (actually 30000/1001) and 23.976 (actually 24000/1001, from telecining) annoying non-integer frame rates are the fault of color NTSC.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">search for 1.001</a>.  If only they'd been willing to risk a few B&amp;W sets not being able to handle an extra 0.1% frequency for the audio subcarrier, the world would have been spared this nonsense.  (I think I saw another article somewhere that made it sound more like many sets would have been fine, but they weren't sure about perfect compat.  Wikipedia makes it sound like no sets would have handle a 0.1% higher audio subcarrier.  IDK the facts.)</p>

<p>Annoying frame rates are one of the lesser sins of broadcasting, though.  It's really interlacing that's been the bane of video quality on modern (all pixels lit at once) screens, and that wouldn't have changed.  I still don't get why interlacing was kept around for HDTV.  Why was 1080i60 was ever defined, instead of using 720p60 to get the same temporal resolution for sports and stuff?  It's similar to 1920x540p60, but with a stupid vertical offset between odd and even fields that requires a lot of computation on the receiving end to make it not look horrible.</p>

<h2>edit:</h2>

<p>For your use-case, I'd absolutely suggest archiving at the native FPS.  Don't throw away any information by dropping frames.  Don't dup frames and make your files bigger (or make your h.264 encoder spend more time noticing the duplicates and outputting a frame full of skip macroblocks that only takes 20 bytes for the whole frame).   </p>

<p>In the future when we hopefully all have freesync displays that can play any framerate, you'll want to undo your pullup to 24fps so your video plays more smoothly!  Or if freesync somehow doesn't catch on, or the display that comes after LCDs is CFR, then rate conversion is probably best done at playback time anyway.  It's not like 24fps even plays perfectly on a 60Hz monitor.  (I don't visually notice the fact that some frames are displayed for 3 * 1/60th while some are displayed for 2 * 1/60th, but it's true).</p>

<p>If you're having problems with Quicktime, then IDK.  Maybe make sure Handbrake is making files with the right framerate set in the h.264 bitstream, as well as the container.  (Yes, h.264 headers can apparently store a frame rate, separate from what the container says.  See the docs for <code>mkvmerge --fix-bitstream-timing-information</code>.  And try using it with <code>--default-duration 16fps</code> to make an mkv file.  Then mux that back to mp4 and see if that fixes quicktime?)  Or maybe there's a way to do it with mp4 tools in the first place.

<p>I can guarantee that arbitrary frame rate mp4 is valid, and even variable framerate mp4 is valid.  If Quicktime plays it wrong, it could well be Quicktime's fault.  Or maybe Handbrake's fault for making the file wrong.  I usually just use ffmpeg directly, because I'm a command line ninja.</p>

"How to move a layer only in one direction?","4536","","<p>Is it possible to just move a layer along one axis, eg <code>x</code>?</p>

<p>I need to move many layers individually in a 3D space, but only along one axis. It would be much quicker if I could lock all axis but one, and then move along that.</p>
","<p>It's easy to do with a quick expression:</p>

<p><kbd>Alt/Option</kbd>-click the stop watch for the position property. You'll see the default expression <strong><em>transform.position</em></strong> is automatically inserted. The position property is an array – it contains the X, Y and Z value components. We want to lock it so that only one of the values can change. So we have to pick the array apart into its components, and then create a new array using some constant values.</p>

<p>So say we want to lock the layer to movement only on the X axis. We'll use the X component of the <strong><em>transform.position</em></strong> array and then put in a constant value for the Y and Z components. Say the layer's Y position is 123 and its Z position is 345. We'd use this expression:</p>

<pre><code>[transform.position[0], 123, 345]
</code></pre>

<p>note that the enclosing square brackets are part of the expression - they turn the three values back into an array. The bit where it says <strong><em>transform.position[0]</em></strong> selects just the first component of the array (just to be annoying, most computer languages <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7320686/why-does-the-indexing-start-with-zero-in-c"">count array components from 0</a>, so the first component is <strong>[0]</strong>, the second <strong>[1]</strong> and so on).</p>

<p>You could refine this to make the layer easier to edit:</p>

<pre><code>[transform.position[0], transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[1], transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[2]]
</code></pre>

<p>here <strong><em>transform.position.valueAtTime(n)</em></strong> is a function that returns the value of the position property at time <em>n</em>. The round brackets are the input to the function, in this case the start of the comp or 0. Then as we want just one part of the position, we then use the square brackets to stipulate which bit: <strong><em>[1]</em></strong> for Y and <strong><em>[2]</em></strong> for Z (remember <strong><em>[1]</em></strong> means the second value in the array and <strong><em>[2]</em></strong> means the third). So the layer will be locked to the Y and Z position it has at the start of the comp, and will be free to move on the X position.</p>

<p>To do the same with the Y position or the Z, or the scale, or rotation or whatevs, you just use the same form, but change the array index (the number in the square brackets). So to lock the movement to only the Y axis:</p>

<pre><code>[transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[0], transform.position[1], transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[2]]
</code></pre>

<p>or Z axis:</p>

<pre><code>[transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[0], transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[1], transform.position[2]]
</code></pre>

<p>By now you should see the pattern.</p>

<p>Note that for 2D layers, the array only has two components, so you'd leave out the third part altogether, so to lock a 2D layer to the X axis you'd use:</p>

<pre><code>[transform.position[0], transform.position.valueAtTime(0)[1]]
</code></pre>

","<p>The output file doesn't have any sound because there <strong>is no audio</strong> in the timeline that you are rendering.</p>

"ffmpeg: explicitly tag h.264 as bt.601, rather than leaving unspecified?","4497","","<p>I want to tag video as explicitly bt.601, rather than ""unspecified"".  I know players typically choose bt.601 as the default for videos less than 1280 pixels wide, but I want to make it explicit that bt.601 is the correct colour matrix for a video.</p>

<p>The sticking point is that there is no <code>bt601</code> option for ffmpeg or libx264, only bt709 and some others.</p>

<p>I have some videos that were downscaled from HD, and are still in bt.709, but aren't tagged properly.  So when I watch a video, I sometimes have to <a href=""https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/1804#issuecomment-92411790"" rel=""noreferrer"">manually toggle my player to bt.709</a>.  Tagging explicitly as bt.601 will communicate to future viewers (e.g. myself) that it's definitely bt.601, and not a mis-tagged bt.709 video, when I look at it with <code>mediainfo</code>.</p>

<p>Another use-case for this would be if you upscaled a bt.601 video to 1280 or higher without doing a colormatrix conversion (using <code>-vf colormatrix</code>), players would incorrectly assume bt.709 if you left the color information unspecified.</p>

<p>FFMpeg's <code>colormatrix</code> video filter does support <code>bt601</code> as an input or output color matrix, but doesn't also set tags.  (Since it doesn't have the side-effect of setting ffmpeg's color options, it refuses to even operate with src and dest the same, like <code>-vf colormatrix=bt601:bt601</code>.)</p>

"120fps 720p footage with real time playback on Ubuntu? + editing?","4452","","<p>I have a laptop with an i7 CPU, 1.73 GHz, 8GB RAM, Ubuntu 10.04 with an ""ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5800 Series"" graphics card. I have compiz enabled (which may be one of the culprits with the problem below).</p>

<p>I have recorded a few short videos in 720p resolution at 120fps (GoPro Hero 3), stored on my local HD. The mp4 videos range from 30MB to 500MB, so quite small.</p>

<p>I tried a variety of players, none of which seem to respond in real time  . In fact the response time is so bad that I get a few frames quite fast at the start but then only the odd frame every second to 5 seconds and the sound seems spliced! One of my 8 cores runs into the ground (100%), the others are essentially unused, with the video player process running at 98%. So obviously this is my limiting factor (can't multi-thread?).</p>

<p>(mplayer, xine both try to play in real time but drop many frames; vlc plays the sound, but shows impressionist rendering and then gets stuck on one frame quite early on; avidemux plays every frame but about 1/6th of real-time speed; cinelerra plays some of the frames only and quite slowly; kdenlive does not allow me to create a 120fps project; Kino converts and down-samples; Lives can't follow; OpenShot plays the sound Ok, but gets stuck on the first frame)</p>

<p>Playing standard 1080p 30fps footage uses about 65% of one core. I did expect that playing 120fps would drop frames, but not to the extent that I only see one every few seconds. In fact I thought that it would play about 1 in 4, which would be great for my purpose.</p>

<p>So I'd really appreciate if any of you had any hint as to how I should configure my video card, system or whatever to get better playback ability, i.e. real-time playback with my raw footage (without conversion or down-sampling prior to viewing).</p>

<p>This also affects my ability to edit the videos as I can't tell what I'm looking at in real time, which is very inconvenient when editing. I do not want to down-sample for the first stage of editing as I want to get a feel for the full video first and choose which sections to slow down for slow-motion and which sections to down-sample for normal real-time play.</p>
","<p>While it is true that 720p video only has about half the data of a 1080p feed, the other thing you have to realize is that when you push the system beyond it's limit, it may spend a lot of time trying to process frames that it doesn't finish in time.  Depending on how the player is configured, it may give up and try to catch up rather than finish rendering the frame and get further behind.</p>

<p>Because of this, as soon as you get behind, you may now end up finding it is much harder for it to catch up.  You also run in to problems with keeping the data flowing quickly enough since the level of compression sounds like it may be higher (harder to decode) and the CPU is so busy that it can't be working on moving data up to be ready to read.</p>

<p>You probably should do a transcode of the video to a lower framerate and work with the transcoded copy to make editing decisions and then swap in the high framerate video only at the end.  After all, the only difference 120fps video will make on final output is anywhere that you end up doing a slow motion effect since you aren't going to have any display (including your computer screen) that can actually load 120 frames per second in to the image buffer.  Even 240hz screens are not displaying that many frames from a source.</p>

It's a tough thing to get right, because lighting needs vary a lot depending on your shooting situation.

"What factors are important for DSLR lenses for shooting video?","4324","","<p>I'm about to upgrade my DSLR camera from a Canon XSi (450D) to either a Canon 7D or T3i (600D).  I'm largely interested in the video features of the camera. I have several mid/high-end lenses that I already use for still photography, but I don't have any ""general purpose"" zoom lenses (since I prefer to use a prime lens for most of my stills).</p>

<p>So, I'd like to get a general-purpose zoom lens (something that covers at least the 20-70mm range, or so) to use for shooting video.</p>

<p>My primary question is, how important is lens quality for videography? I know that ""quality"" can mean many different things, so let me break this question down a little bit more.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How important is sharpness? 1080p video is barely 2 megapixels, so it would stand to reason that an ultra-sharp lens is not really necessary to get sharp-looking video. Is this an accurate assumption?</p>

<p>My approach for buying lenses for still photography has usually been to buy the best lens I can afford for the application I'm interested in. I'm wondering/hoping that it might be reasonable to buy a cheaper lens for video, and not feel like I'm sacrificing image quality, since the output resolution is so much lower than with stills. Is this just wishful thinking?</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously a large aperture is a bonus for video, since long exposures can't be used. But when shooting in low-light, again, it would stand to reason that I might be able to use a higher ISO to compensate for a slower lens, with less noticeable impact, since I'm recording at a much lower resolution than I would be for still photography. Is this also true? How fast of a lens do I need to be able to record in an average indoor lighting setting (no studio lighting), without a high ISO becoming noticeable?</p></li>
<li><p>Is image stabilization a pro or a con for hand-held video recording? I can imagine the sound of the motor might be a nuisance if picked up by the microphone. What impact does it have on the video itself?</p></li>
<li><p>I'm guessing a USM for auto focus probably won't matter a whole lot, since what I've read suggests that live auto-focus doesn't work very well in video mode. But even so, I suppose a USM AF would be a bonus, if/when it does work.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability for a lens to retain focus when zooming seems like it might be of particular importance when shooting video on a zoom lens.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Are there other factors I ought to consider when selecting a lens <em>specifically for video</em>?</p>

<p>I'm not really interested in pointers on which focal lengths I ought to use for what type of shooting, or specific lens recommendations... I'm interested in more general pointers, that will apply to all video shooting.</p>

<p>It depends on the way the DSLR is capturing it's video from the sensor. The first method is the most obvious one, take the image and scale it, but there's also another; use only the pixels across the sensor's area that approximately ""line up"" with the pixels in the final resolution. I.e. in a 1080p image only every third or fourth scan line would be used resulting in one sensor pixel being used to produce one pixel in the video image.</p>

<p>I would hazard a guess that an ""acceptably sharp"" lens would be okay for video, though not ideal and probably for more reasons than image sharpness.</p>

<p>As my above answer suggested, there are other aspects of the lens you need to keep in mind when choosing a video lens and these may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maximum aperture for low-light.</li>
<li>Fixed aperture for consistent exposure when zooming.</li>
<li>Image stabilisation is especially useful when not using a steadicam or other stabilising rig or device.</li>
<li>Ease of use, especially when it comes to the focus ring. Canon USM lenses in particular have a very smooth, usually well placed and grippy focus ring. Kit lenses aren't so good in comparison.</li>

<p>I think you'll find with most typical video DSLR's is that the ISO performance for video isn't quite as great as you might assume, but it in no way bad. I'd say ISO 1600-3200 lives up to most expectations on the 18mp APS-C sensors, but beyond that it's quite noticeable.</p>

  <p>Is image stabilization a pro or a con for hand-held video recording? I can imagine the sound of the motor might be a nuisance if picked up by the microphone. What impact does it have on the video itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For music videos and other videos where sound is not used, IS is fantastic and goes a long way to ensuring the video is jitter free, but if you need the sound and it's potentially a quiet environment, it might be prudent to use an external, higher quality mic attached to say, the hot shoe via a mount.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm guessing a USM for auto focus probably won't matter a whole lot, since what I've read suggests that live auto-focus doesn't work very well in video mode. But even so, I suppose a USM AF would be a bonus, if/when it does work.</p>
  
  <p>The ability for a lens to retain focus when zooming seems like it might be of particular importance when shooting video on a zoom lens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As above, Canon USM lenses (whether L or standard) have very usable focus rings. Provide good grip and are very smooth to focus with.</p>

<hr>

<p>I personally use a Canon EOS 60D with an EF-S 17-55mm F/2.8 IS USM lens and find it a great combination at those focal lengths. The IS in that lens is quite remarkable and the USM focus ring makes it very smooth and accurate to focus. When I turn the IS off, I can instantly see the jittery movement from my hands trying to hold a 2kg camera setup.</p>

"How to make the rest of the mask transparent in Premier Pro CS6?","4293","","<p>I'm trying to highlight a part of my video. Since I'm totally new to video editing on Premier Pro - I'm not sure if this is the best way of doing that, but I'm using masks.</p>

<p>I have a title sitting in <code>video 2</code> row, in it a have a rectangular mask (100% opacity)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1YBT.png"" alt=""title""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zf0JQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This seems like a step in the right direction, but I can't find the place to change the settings of the mask to enable transparency. The intended result is to have dimmed out frame, with only the masked area fully shown.</p>

<p>This is the <code>Effect Controls</code> screen for my video:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XndY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Ok, now that I was able to reproduce your technique thus far, I can fill in the missing pieces.  Your use of the Track Matte Key produces a layer that is transparent everywhere other than where the mask is present.  You need to layer it overtop of the video that you want behind it and you need to apply the dimming effect to the background layer.</p>

<p>In your example, Move video 2 to Video 3 and copy Video 1 to Video 2.  Leave the track matte key on Video 2 and remove it from Video 1.  This will layer the highlighted area (Video 2) over the full video (Video 1).  You can then either reduce the opacity or apply a brightness reduction to Video 1 to make it appear more subdued and get the look you are going for.  </p>

"Awful Audio in Video post-render (Premiere Pro CC)","4276","","<p>I'm trying out Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2014 and I have a video with three audio tracks. The quality of each track is as follows (listed as the ""Source Audio Format"" in Premiere): </p>

Why is this so?","4236","","<p>I'm uploading a file to an external system that accepts only mpg or mpeg extension files. I had a mp4 file so I changed the mp4 extension to mpg and I was able to upload the file into the system. Would other using the system who have access to this uploaded mpg file be able to view my video correctly? </p>

<p>Why is it that I can change the extension from .mp4 to .mpg and the video still plays fine? Should it not give me an error because the extension is not correct?</p>
","<p>The <code>.mpg</code> and <code>.mpeg</code> extensions are typically associated with MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 files. The structure of these files is different than the .mp4 format used for H.264 video, part of the MPEG-4 family of formats.</p>

<p>I suspect VLC and WMP can play the file because they must not be using the file extension to determine file type, they probably parse the file with all the supported parsers until one works. To prove this point, I took a .wmv movie and renamed it to .mp4. When I played it in my Windows 7 PC with WMP I got a warning window saying that the extension did not match the format, but I told it to proceed anyway and the file played just fine.</p>

<p>If this online service requires MPEG-1 or 2 then you should transcode your video to one of those formats before uploading. Unless the online service transcodes all uploaded videos to some standard format. In that case it does not really matter what the format of the uploaded video is, as long as the service can read it and transcode to its own favorite format.</p>

","<p>This looks to me like an actual issue with the scripts in the preset vs your build of FFMpeg.  It appears that the syntax of options being passed to the encoder are incorrect (particularly something related to ""wpred"" and a missing parens) and since they are not specified in your command line, I can only assume it is the preset that is the problem.

It seems like nothing should change if I just remove some of the video. I should be perfectly capable of just copying the same video over, with just part of it removed.</p>

<p>Is there any way for me to do a crop in ffmpeg without having to do a re-encode? The extra encoding time makes my processing times really long and the new bitrates caused by the re-encode makes the video parts out of sync and unable to be played properly.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>A videofilter in ffmpeg always has to modify pixel information hence the reason why you need to re-encode.
It seems logical at first that you wouldn't have to do this when cropping but the way lossy video codecs work makes this pretty impossible without re-encoding everything.
They usually don't see an array of pixel information but a much more complex representation of pixel blobs that are described in a way that takes up less space than the original pixel blob, you can't really ""crop"" that encoding, to do a crop you would first need to decode the information to know what you are dealing with but then you need to re-encode to have it compressed again. Thats the main stepping stone.
Then they also use things like motion estimation that depends on information before and after certain frames, if that information changes all of the sudden the whole thing is screwed up and you end up with tons of artifacts when decoding the video during playback.</p>

<p><strong>tldr;</strong> no its not possible to crop without re-encoding in any tool.</p>

<p>Unless you deal with some very specific lossless non-consumer intermediate codecs that would enable it but in that case transcoding wouldn't be an issue.</p>

"what graphics card features effect NVIDIA NVENC hardware encoding speed?","3957","","<p>I have a web project I am working on that requires transcoding of multiple short video clips (6-10 seconds) uploaded by users into a web friendly H.264 format on my linux server.  I have been able to enable NVIDIA NVENC hardware acceleration with ffmpeg and a 4 year old GeForce GTX 670, and I'm getting hardware encoding speeds twice that of my software encoding (Xeon E5-1620 v3).  With an $800 video card budget, I'd like to be able to transcode these short video clips as fast as possible because I will have multiple users uploading them simultaneously.  </p>

<p>The NVENC engine does have <a href=""http://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/NVENC_DA-06209-001_v07.pdf?autho=1452972945_d6791efa67031b38127384c5c437f683&amp;file=NVENC_DA-06209-001_v07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">licensing limitations</a> when implemented on a consumer level NVIDIA card: only 2 video transcoding threads can be run simultaneously, even if you have multiple cards.  If I decide to go with one of the pricy quadro card line, then I am only limited by the other hardware elsewhere in my system in terms of how many threads I can run.  However, with my specific project I'm a lot better off transcoding these clips in a series rather than parallel because the clips will be viewed in the order they're uploaded. Clips later in the queue can be transcoded as earlier clips are viewed. If clips are transcoded in parallel on the same card, performance is inversely proportional to the number of simultaneous threads.</p>

<p>Having stated this, my plan is to set up two NVIDIA cards and run a single thread on each one to maximize throughput.  The <a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk"" rel=""nofollow"">NVIDIA codec SDK</a> is vague on NVENC performance difference between various cards, but it seems that there is a <a href=""http://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/NVENC_DA-06209-001_v07.pdf?autho=1452974230_cc98539d0a11948f1978940adf52093e&amp;file=NVENC_DA-06209-001_v07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">major difference</a> between GPU generations Maxwell Gen 2> Maxwell Gen 1> Kepler.  I can find no reliable benchmarks for NVENC encoding (opposed to CUDA benchmarking, which is easy to find).</p>

<p>In the absence of hard benchmarking data comparing various cards, what features of the currently available cards would have to largest impact on single thread NVENC encoding speed?  Since the actual GPU is not utilized fully during transcoding, does GPU and memory clock speed affect this function much?  I have $400/card to spend, but if the entry level Maxwell Gen 2 GeForce GTX 960 is as good as the more recent cards, then I will put extra money into other aspects of the server (CPU/RAM/SSD etc).  I know this might seem like a subjective question (what's <em>best</em>), but I am trying to make a self-educated guess based on an understanding of the transcoding hardware.</p>
","<p>The main two features in transcode with NVENC: A <strong>video memory</strong> if you want to transcode a many streams and the second one is a <strong>GPU</strong>. Maxwell Gen 2 this is best at the moment. <br>
<em>Regarding licensing limitations</em>: only 2 video transcoding threads can be run simultaneously on a consumer level NVIDIA card, but this regulated on driver level. And with a strong desire this limitation may be removed then a maximum transcoding threads will be depend of a video memory size and Video Engine utilization, but for one transcoding thread for different video cards is necessary different video memory size. For example, one ffmpeg thread cost is 100 MB video on QUADRO K 4200(4GB) and 170 MB on GTX 980 TI(6GB). <br> <br>
<em>It may be interesting for you, my results in transcoding SD sources in a real time:</em><br>
<em>QUADRO K4200(4GB):</em> one transcoding thread cost is 100 MB and we can run in parallel about 36 threads, but the bottleneck is a video engine utilization. I can run about 30 parallel threads with -preset hp -profile:v -vcodec nvenc_264 <br>
<em>GTX 980 TI(6GB)</em>: the bottleneck is video memory. I can run about 32 threads (32*170=5440) in parallel. I did it for tests, of course. But video engine results is better then on K4200 in 2.5 times. This 32 threads with -preset slow -profile:v -vcodec nvenc_264 -vf yadif=0 and Video Engine utilization is only 80%. <br>
I tested this on <em>GTX 660(2GB, Maxwell Gen 2)</em> is about 15 parallel threads due to video memory.</p>

<p><strong>My conclusion:</strong> If you will transcode no more then 2 threads in parallel GTX 960 is a good variant, but you can save some money to another hardware and look to another video card with Maxwell Gen1. If you will go to the hack way then GTX 960 is a good variant but only with 4GB video memory.    </p>

"FCP vs Motion 5","3926","","<p>I searched around and I have not come across a good answer.
What does FCP have that Motion5 does not? I have been looking at the two and they look relatively the same. Here is some of what I am doing/care about:</p>

<p>I love YouTube, I want to become a video maker. I want to do productions from Minecraft ExplodingTNT to Smosh to Productions and more... I need a video editor to make up for iMovie because I am sick of the export errors, slowness, and overall limitations of it. My budget is low so I don't really want to get FCP, Avid, or Adobe Production Suite until I can get the money to get them. I am also looking into 3d stuff like Cinima 4D and Autodesk Entertainment  Creation Suite (or a few of the products in that suite) but that can be for another time. I am also experienced in audio creation and editing. I have Ableton and am planning to get more software (if that is helpful to know). Really, I want to know if Motion is all that is needed for a pretty experienced, but still new person to video creation. Or if I should go strait to the big stuff.</p>

<p><strong>I still want to know some big differences regardless of my needs.</strong></p>

<p><em>If I did something wrong or you want more information on something, feel free to leave a comment because I am new to AVP.</em></p>
","<p>There's actually a <em>big</em> difference between the two. If you're on a budget and don't mind that editing video is not as straight forward, then Motion is actually not a bad route to take.  </p>

<p>Final Cut allows you to use things you've created in Motion as graphical templates. Motion in and of itself is a 2D(/3D) animation app, it wasn't made for video editing. </p>

<p>So, although you <em>can</em> edit video in Motion, doesn't mean it's very comfortable. For instance, you can just press a shortcut to render your timeline in Proxy, High Quality format. If you'd do the same thing in Motion, you would have to encode the material by yourself and tell Motion manually to use the Proxy's instead of the original material. </p>

<p>Final Cut also has some media management tools that allow you to quickly find the footage you want to edit. So if you imported tons of clips, it's easier to find a particular clip in FCP than in M5. </p>

<p>Both apps work well together, but in itself, Motion wasn't made to edit video. If you come from iWork. Editing in Final Cut Pro is almost equal (if not the same). </p>

<p>I can't talk about Avid, Premiere, but they work similarly to the ""old"" way of editing video, where the timeline is static. When there is a clip deleted between two clips, they don't ripple together. They stay at their current position. Some people prefer to edit that way. Personally I can't see myself going back to that way of editing, it is simply too slow.</p>

<p>Now in regards to 3D… Motion is a 2D motion graphics application. It can do 3D too, but it misses most features ""real"" 3D apps have like fluid or explosion calculations of material. Material can also have a real material. So the app knows that wood explodes differently from glass. If you are new in 3D animation and just want to tip your toes in, go for Blender. It is hard to learn, though, because it's free, there are tons of tutorials available online to get you quick up and running. </p>

<p>After Effects is the industry leader in motion graphics. It is said that nothing can't be done in After Effects. Motion tries to an After Effects. It is also said that Motion can do everything that After Effects can, but, again, with more effort. </p>

<p>As a summary. If you're on a budget and need a great 2D motion graphics app, Motion is not a bad choice. It works well together with Final Cut Pro, a video editing app that is similar to iMovie. Though 3D animation can be done in Motion, it is better to use a dedicated 3D animation app like Blender. If you really want the most top-notch effects, templates and biggest community (and can afford the price of a monthly/yearly Cloud membership) go with Adobe. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

"How to prevent users from downloading videos?","3924","","<p>We want to provide VOD service via http/https, but we dont want users download a video by finding out the url directly from the web player or using a developer plugin like firebug. </p>

<p>We are told that only option for us is to implement DRM to protect video content.
Is it true that DRM is the only option?
If there are other options, please suggest it.
Any expert opinion is most welcome on this.
Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, no, that's the entire reason DRM exists.  It is a bit like trying to prevent someone from recording an on-air broadcast.  When you send video data over the internet to someone's player, they can simply store the information being sent to the player unless you obfuscate it and make it so that the player will only work under certain circumstances and will not share the data.  This, by definition, is DRM.</p>

<p>What DRM attempts to do is control the reading of the data entirely, so that it can not be copied.  This has varying degrees of success and rarely, if ever, works particularly well.  It may keep honest people honest, but if you are sending someone data in a way that they can access it, measures to try to stop them from copying it are... difficult.  The most advanced systems use special display drivers and encrypt the data right up to the point it is being displayed on the screen (HDCP), that way other software on the computer can't directly pull the information off the frame buffer being prepared for the screen.</p>

<p>There may be some ways you can mildly obfuscate the access to your video, but ultimately, if you send it in the clear, it is trivial for a knowledgeable viewer to store the datastream.  If you use DRM, it is substantially harder, but still likely to be able to be worked around by a dedicated attacker.</p>

<p>Also if there is a known software that reduces background noise, please share its name.</p>
","<p>Your most critical need is going to be a professional low noise analog to digital converter and pre-amp with a decent quality microphone to go with it.  There are a few options you can pursue for this depending on your interests.</p>

<p>Since you are currently working with a computer directly, you could go for any of a number of professional audio capture devices with XLR and phantom power capabilities, such as the X2U adapter from Shure that you were talking about or a device like an MAudio audio interface unit.  </p>

<p>Since these only provide inputs you would also need a microphone.  Depending on how close you mind the mic being, something as simple as an SM58 would produce nice clean audio for you, this has the added advantage of being usable really close to your mouth and focusing the pickup in a cardioid pattern that mostly picks up stuff in front of the microphone, thus it will pick up less background noise.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could use a condenser mic or shotgun mic that could be placed further away, however a condenser mic would pick up more of the room sound and a shotgun mic would require careful aiming in order to make sure it picks you up and not the room.  A Lapel mic or LAV is also an option.  A lapel mic is a type of condenser that can clip to your shirt and therefore pick up a little less noise, but will still be in the shot, though it is less obvious than a dynamic mic like an SM58.</p>

<p>Yet another option to get additional flexibility is to go with a device like an H4n recorder.  This is what I use for my video work.  It is a stand alone recorder which can also be used as an audio interface for the PC and also has built in stereo condenser mics.  The device runs a little bit more expensive than an audio interface, but is normally a bit cheaper than an interface and a condenser mic pair.  It also can be used away from a computer for any project.</p>

<p>Additionally, the H4n includes XLR and 1/4"" inputs so that it can be used with any of the mics you could use with an audio interface if you later decide to upgrade or change to a different kind of microphone for a particular recording task.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download size</li>
<li>Encoding time</li>
<li>Format compat: Will it work out of the box on both a Mac and Windows machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>To my knowledge, WMV works out of the box on Windows and MP4 works out of the box on Mac. Is there a format that works for both and has a reasonable file size?</p>
","<p>Your comparison of WMV to MP4 is a little bit confusing, because you're comparing apples and oranges.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MP4 is a container format, which may contain a variety of audio and video formats.  Most commonly, an MP4 file will contain wither an MPEG-4 Part 10 (aka H.264) or MPEG-4 Part 2 video stream, although it can contain MPEG-2 or MPEG-1 video streams.  There are a number of audio codecs that can be stored in an MP4 file as well. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp4#Data_streams"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>WMV is an actual codec (akin to H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 2 mentioned above), and files that end in .WMV are generally stored in an ASF container (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Video#Container_format"" rel=""nofollow"">see here</a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What this all boils down to, is you need to use a <em>codec</em> that both Mac and Windows can play.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291948"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft</a>, as of July 2010, Windows Media Player for Windows XP supports (among others):</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft MPEG-4 Standard Video Codec</li>
<li>Vivo H.264 Video CODEC</li>
</ul>

<p>Which suggests that it ought to play back the two common video formats contained in .MP4 files.  Note the caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all of the supported codecs are installed by default. These codecs will be downloadable when you play content that requires the codec.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it's possible that your users may be prompted to install a codec the first time they try to play one of your videos.</p>

<p>You'll also want to make sure you use an audio codec supported by Windows Media Player. The most common (but by no means only) one is probably MPEG-1/MPEG-2 Audio Layer III (aka MP3), and this is in the list of supported codecs.</p>

<p>So based on this information, if you use MP4 streaming, Windows users should have no trouble playing back your videos.  Although you'll surely want to test your specific output files on a fresh Windows (and Mac) install before you commit to this decision.</p>

See the <a href=""http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Synopsis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FFmpeg synopsis</a> and <a href=""http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Description"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FFmpeg description</a> for more details on option placement.</p>

<p>Therefore, you must move your <code>-q</code> (alias for <code>-qscale</code>) option:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i video_test.avc -q:v 2 frames/frames_%04d.jpg
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>-f image2</code> is superfluous here since ffmpeg knows that your outputs are images.</li>
<li>A sane range for <code>-q:v</code> for the encoder <code>mjpeg</code> is 2-5; lower is higher quality.</li>
<li>It is recommended to be explicit as to which stream you want to apply <code>-q</code> to since ffmpeg can not know if it should be applied to video or audio, so in your case use <code>-q:v</code>. This is good practice, although it does not matter for your input since you have no audio.</li>

"Improving frame/image quality on Handbrake?","3660","","<p>I created a .cdr file from a DVD and converted it to an .mp4 with <a href=""https://handbrake.fr/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Handbrake</a>. My only issue is Handbrake's default settings create a somewhat grainy picture. The file size went from 1.24Gb to ~100Mb so I assume that explains it. </p>

<p>I'm unfamiliar with the determinants of frame image quality. Here's a screenshot of Handbrake's interface, might someone point me in the direction of the thing to toggle that might improve the .mp4 quality?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WFO1X.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Under the video tab, you'll see two options. Video Codec, which is how the video is encoded (h.264 is the standard for .mp4 files), and Quality, which controls the level of video compression that occurs.</p>

<p>It's the Quality slider that you're mostly worried about if you want to keep it an mp4. Drag that slider to the right to improve the quality (this will also increase the file size) or to the left to decrease the file size (this will also decrease the quality). Or if you know exactly the size of file you want, divide the desired file size by the number of seconds and you can input the kb/s that you want the video to be compressed to (smaller file sizes means higher compression and lower quality, higher file sizes equals less compression and higher quality).</p>

<p>In order to test to make sure that you like your quality selection and file size, you can choose a single chapter of the film (if your cdr has that stored) and run that through the encoder and test the quality.</p>

<p>Another thing that is available to choose is the video resolution, but in my experience with handbrake, it's quite temperamental, so I only recommend messing with that if you really need to.</p>

","<p>No most video formats (nearly all) do not allow custom ICC color profiles to be embedded. (Improvemet/correction: MP4s can have color profiles tagged in the metadata of a video file.) most video on the consumer end is intended for the REC.709 color space. sRGB is similar and uses the same primaries. transcoding (including compressing) will almost always result is a slight shift in color accuracy, saturation, gamma curve, or black and white level shift.

Color- <strong>#FFF600</strong>;
Strokes > Inner Strokes- color <strong>#000000</strong></p>

<p>Is this the correct way?</p>
","<p>For some reason the default subtitle colour often seems to be yellow; I can't find any definitive reason why though. I hate yellow subtitles with a passion, they always look hideous and distracting, so I always make mine white. To separate them from light coloured backgrounds I use a soft black drop shadow if possible, or otherwise a black border. As you can see below they are readable even over light backgrounds.</p>

<p>The size depends on the viewing medium. The one below looks a bit wee in the size it's displayed on this page (on a retina screen on a 15"" laptop), so if I was doing subtitles for handheld devices where it might be displayed at this size I'd make it larger, but on a TV it's plenty big enough. In a cinema it might be a bit too large. Resolution is a factor, too. If this was going to standard definition I'd have to bump up the font size a bit too.</p>

<p>Sans-serif is my default choice, usually Arial because it's so bland, so it doesn't distract from the art direction. Serif fonts are also a problem if the video is ever going to be displayed on interlaced screens (which applies if it is to be broadcast, at least until all the old interlaced TVs have gone to the verge), because the thin horizontal lines flicker between fields. Also at low resolutions the thin parts of the letters get lost. So while serif fonts generally have greater readability they might not be the best choice just yet.</p>

"How to get smooth motion when changing clip speed?","3401","","<p>Let's say I have a 30fps video created by a camera panning at a constant speed while filming some static scenery.</p>

<p>If I watch the video, the motion in the video is perfectly smooth.
If I double the speed, the motion continues to be perfectly smooth.
If I half the speed, the video looks choppy but again the motion continues to look smooth.</p>

<p>The problem comes when I try to change the speed by irregular numbers.
Let's say I want to change the speed of the video to 120%. I then export the video at 30 FPS. The motion in the video then becomes visually choppy, jerky.</p>

<p>I quickly figured out what is happening: by increasing the speed, my 30 FPS video becomes 30*1.2=36FPS. But I am exporting at the standard 30FPS so every 6th frame is dropped. This means that every 5 frames the camera moves at double speed. If I look at the motion frame by frame the camera movement is: slow, slow, slow, slow, FAST, slow, slow, slow, slow, FAST, slow, slow, slow, slow, FAST, etc.</p>

<p>So finally my question is what option do I have to get smooth motion or hide this problem when changing the the speed of the video by small intervals?</p>

<p>Shooting at a higher shutter speed is not an option in my opinion, as it just blurs the motion until the problem is not visible.</p>

<p>I use Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects.
Will the Time Warp plugin in After Effects be able to create smooth motion by using motion vectors? What if there is active movement in the scene? will it still look good?</p>

<p>I have yet to see people truly understand this problem. How is this effect called? Does anyone have any link or article explaining what I described?</p>

<p>I don't get that part. Isn't hiding the problem until it is no longer visible what you want?<br>
Also, a higher shutter speed results in less blurred frames, not the other way around. </p>

<p>Use one of the other Time Interpolation modes Premiere Pro has to offer. At the bottom of the Export Settings dialog, there's a dropdown menu containing three options: Frame Sampling, Frame Blending and Optical Flow. You will find the same dropdown menu in the Speed/Duration panel that can be accessed via the context-menu to change the interpolation mode of individual clips. </p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/duration-speed.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Optical Flow feature in Premiere Pro uses frame analyses and pixel motion estimation to create brand new video frames, resulting in significantly smoother speed changes, time-remapping, and frame-rate conversion. [...]</p>
  
  <p>Frame Sampling repeats or removes frames as needed to reach the desired speed. Frame Blending repeats frames, and it also blends between them as needed to help smooth out the motion. </p>

<p><a href=""https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/optical-flow-time-remapping-tips-tricks-for-best-results/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's another helpful article on using the Optical Flow interpolation.</a> </p>

<p>I suggest you try all the interpolation modes and see what works best for your footage.</p>

<p>One more thing, you probably don't want to hear that, but 30 fps video is really bad for doing slow or fast motion effects (except maybe timelapses with 200% speed or more). As you explained yourself, there's not that many frames to go on so some frames will need to be dropped, synthesised or blended in some way which looks subpar at best. The interpolation algorithms do a decent job, but it will never look as good as it would with footage that was shot at a higher frame rate in the first place. </p>

"How do I batch replace video clips in Premiere to graded copies? (from Da Vinci Resolve)","3397","","<p>My color grader and I are working in parallel.  I'm editing in Adobe Premiere, and he is grading in Da Vinci Resolve (version CC 2015.2 and 12, respectively).  I gave him an early rough cut of the film to start grading.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the cutting of the film since I exported him the rough cut XML of the project. The typical round-trip workflow I find online is to export XML projects back and forth between the NLE and Resolve, but that doesn't work for us because the Premiere project has changed so much and will continue to change.</p>

<p>Instead, we're trying to have Resolve render graded replacement video files for all of the source clips used, and tell Premiere to point to a different source clip.  The following technique seems to work, but has to be done clip by clip: ""Project Pane > Right click > Replace Footage"".</p>

<p>Is there an easier way to do this transition in Premiere and Da Vinci Resolve?  Or a better workflow in general for a colorist to work in parallel with an editor?</p>
","<p><strong>Method 1</strong>
First, with the Premiere project closed, move the original files that you're editing with to a new folder or other location. Open your project and it will warn you of missing files. Click the <strong>Relink others automatically</strong> checkbox and then hit <strong>Locate</strong>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m1rvw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m1rvw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Navigate to the folder with the new graded footage, find the first clip and press Ok. It will then re-link all the other files to the matching files in new folder.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that this will only work if the files <strong>have the same name</strong>. Different extensions are ok, from my experience it's smart enough to deal with it if your original footage was an MXF and you're replacing it with an AVI for example.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong>
In your project window, or in your timeline, select all the files you want to replace, right-click and choose <strong>Make Offline</strong>. Generally you want to choose ""leave the media files on disk"" in the dialogue that opens, because it permanently deletes the file if you don't.</p>

<p>Once your clips are offline then you can re-link. With all the files still selected, right-click and choose ""Link Media"". This will open up the same dialogue as method 1, so as before you choose <strong>Relink others automatically</strong> and navigate to your graded footage.</p>

<p>Again, this only works if the graded clips are <strong>named the same</strong> as the originals.</p>

<p><strong>Method 3</strong> 
With the project closed, move the original clips from where they are on your hard drive, and replace them with the graded clips. When you open the project it will link to the new clips, again, provided that they are named the same. You will need to re-render any rendered clips in your timeline.</p>

<p>Another note is that if your footage contained audio you need the graded footage to contain audio, even if you're not using it. Premiere won't accept them otherwise. So in Resolve, make sure you check the ""Render Audio"" box.</p>

<p>I use this workflow when I'm working with BlackMagic Cinema Camera footage. DaVinci Resolve gives me much better results than the Adobe grading tools, either in Premiere or Speedgrade. The only thing that does nearly as good a job is using Adobe Camera Raw by opening the footage in After Effects and rendering out intermediates, but that is extremely tedious and dog-slow.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to post anything else that has the slightest chance of helping.</p>
","<p>Premiere Pro CS5 should be able to import H.264 video, IIRC, however it may be having trouble with the audio and/or container format. With ffmpeg try re-muxing the video stream without the audio:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input -an -codec:v copy output.mp4 -an -codec:v copy output.avi
</code></pre>

<p>If both <code>output.mp4</code> and <code>output.avi</code> work then we know that the issue lies with the audio (although H.264 with b-frames in AVI probably isn't a great idea). You can re-encode the audio and keep the video:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input -codec:v copy -codec:a pcm_s16le output.avi
</code></pre>

<p>If the first command does not work with Premiere, then you may need to re-encode. This is a good use case for an editor friendly, lossless intermediate file:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input -codec:v utvideo -codec:a pcm_s16le output.avi
</code></pre>

<p>Close Premiere, install <a href=""http://umezawa.dyndns.info/archive/utvideo/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ut Video</a> (scroll to the bottom of the page), open Premiere, and import your video. You can do your editing, and then export to your final format using the crappy Adobe Media Encoder, or export to another lossless file, and then use ffmpeg to provide whatever you need. Alternatively, if you're using Windows you can use <a href=""http://www.debugmode.com/frameserver/"" rel=""nofollow"">Debugmode FrameServer</a> and encode directly with ffmpeg from Premiere.

"How to fit 720p video on a 1080p container?","3356","","<p>I am using Adobe Premier Pro to edit our short film and give some generic editing to it. </p>

<p>At the time of shoot we wanted a slow motion effect in a shot, so we shot at 720p at 60fps <em>(We had limitations, our camera doesn't supported 60fps at 1080p)</em>. </p>

<p>Now when post processing all the videos fit in the 1080 container but our slow motion video shows black blank space around them. How to overcome this?</p>
","<p>You can make a clip scale to the resolution of the sequence by right-clicking on it and pressing <strong>Set to frame size</strong> (For older versions of Premiere, use <strong>Scale to frame size</strong>). To set this at the standard behaviour for new clips that aren't the same resolution as the sequence, go to <strong>Preferences</strong> → <strong>General</strong> and check <strong>Default scale to frame size</strong>.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that upscaling a 720p video to 1080p won't yield you any more quality, worse case, it will look worse. Also, exporting to 1080p when your video is actually only 720p is kind of tricking the viewer. If you upload an upscaled video to Youtube and flag it as 'Full HD', I will so downvote your video ... So if your source material is shot in 720p, I would highly recommend you export to 720p.</p>

I'm kinda new to AE and having a weird issue while trying to render a 1920x1080 Composition.</p>

<p>I've checked all of my objects and i have no composition with the large dimensions mentioned in the error. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Did anyone ever bump into this error ? It would greatly help me to hear from the more experienced one.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />

","<p>It would be good to know what OS your machine is running and if it's 32 or 64 bit, and the resources as in type of processor (Dual Core, i3, i7?) and how much DRAM is on the motherboard. I am not an After Effects user (yet) but this error appears to be a resource error, which is common to many other video editors.</p>

<p>It would also be helpful to have you describe what you are trying to render in AE. For instance how long is the piece, how many video tracks, what effects are used, etc.</p>

<p>Without knowing your computer's resources is not a show stopper, here are some items to check.</p>

<p>Are you running anything else when AE is trying to render, if so try your render again with nothing running but AE.</p>

<p>If you have a 32 bit machine you may have a 2GB limit on the RAM, which is going to be an issue. Have you tried this on a 64 bit machine with more memory?</p>

<p>What resources do you have AE using besides the requested render? For instance do you have the preview screen on 'auto' size mode, you might try to make the preview smaller and in a 1/4 or 1/2 mode so AE doesn't have to figure out each display frame size thereby freeing up some cycles.</p>

"vary the color of repeated shape in After Effects","3335","","<p>I have a shape, in a shape layer, let's say a triangle. I apply a repeater to the shape, and I get lots of them. I can change the distance between them and their rotation ...<br>
My question is: Is there a way to change their color? I mean to control what fill or stroke color each of the cloned ones have? either a random color or even specified color for each?  </p>
","<p>I don't think it's possible with repeater. You could do this with expressions and multiple duplicates of the shape however.</p>

<p>Here's an example I came up with:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wilKM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And here's how I did it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstly make your initial shape. Now duplicate that shape (with the shape selected hit<br>
<kbd>ctrl / ⌘</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>). You should see this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/spxW8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that we'll be making as many copies as we want later, but for the moment only make one, and get it set up so that we can duplicate it and not have to apply expressions to dozens of copies individually.</p></li>
<li><p>For each of the properties you want to alter with every repetition we'll add an <strong>Expression Control</strong> effect, as a handy way to be able to control the whole thing from a single slider.<br>
Say we wanted to alter the position, scale and rotation: we'd add a <strong>Point Control</strong> effect to control position another for scale, and an <strong>Angle Control</strong> for rotation. Expression controls are in <strong>Effects>Expression Controls></strong><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7pCNy.png"" alt=""effect controls""></p></li>
<li><p>For ease of use rename each effect suitably. I've changed <em>""Point Control""</em> to <em>""offset""</em> and <em>""scale ctrl""</em>, and changed <em>""Angle Control""</em> to <em>""rotation""</em>:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxZ2H.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>We're going to add expressions to control the <strong>transform>Position</strong> property, the <strong>Transform>Rotation</strong> property and the <strong>Transform>Scale</strong> property of each shape object. Note that this is the property inside the shape, not the Transform properties for the layer.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/me1yb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>In order to increment the rotation and scale etc. for each duplicate of the Polystar shape we have to find its index, or its serial number so to speak. With layers this is relatively easy, each layer has an <strong>index</strong> property, but shapes within a layer are layer sub-objects so we have to use a bit of magic to get the index of each. <a href=""https://forums.creativecow.net/thread/227/25458"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This thread</a> is where I got the info I needed to work it out.</p>

<p>the key bit of the expression you need is this:</p>

<p><code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(2).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code></p>

<p>The variable shapeIndex now gives you a unique index for each duplicate that you create. This index can then drive the value of the various properties.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Skip this section if you're not interested in how it works</em>  </p>
  
  <p>The expression <code>propertyGroup(2)</code> returns the string <code>""Polystar 2""</code> and we
  use javascript string function <code>split()</code> to split it on the space
  which returns an array <code>[""Polystar"", ""2""]</code>.<br>
  We select the second member
  of that array (or member[1], since javascript numbers arrays starting
  at 0) which returns <code>""1""</code>. If javascript wasn't so sloppy with types we'd have to
  explicitly convert the string <code>""1""</code> into the integer <code>1</code>, but it does the
  conversion without even being told. Yay Javascript!</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>So to add an offset to each duplicated shape layer we then use the shapeIndex variable and the expression control. </p></li>
<li><p>Firstly we'll add an expression to the shape's <strong>Transform>Position</strong> property. <kbd>alt</kbd>-click on the stopwatch next to the property to set an expression for that property. It will look like this:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EEKH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Delete what is there by default and paste in the shapeIndex variable definition mentioned above:<br>
<code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(2).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code><br>
hit <kbd>return</kbd> (not <kbd>enter</kbd>) to start a new line</p></li>
<li><p>Now use the pickwhip to get the value of the Expression Control Effect that we created for the offset:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MvTmH.png"" alt=""don&#39;t spare the pickwhip""></p></li>
<li><p>Now we multiply that offset by the shapeIndex variable. The expression should now look like this:  </p>

<p><code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(2).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code><br>
<code>effect(""offset"")(""Point"")*shapeIndex</code></p>

<p>So if your offset is [20, 20], then the fist duplicate will have an offset of [20,20], the next [20,20]*2 which is [40, 40], then [60, 60] and so on. You'll be able to change the value of this point control and have the duplicates update as you do it, without having to type any more code.</p></li>
<li><p>The same applies to rotation:</p>

<p><code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(2).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code><br>
<code>effect(""rotation"")(""Angle"")*shapeIndex;</code></p></li>
<li><p>And scale. Scale is a bit different because we want to increment the difference between 100 and the value of the controll - if the control is 110% we want to add 10% to the scale. And once we start adding vectors and scalars it gets more complicated - we have to unpack the array, and the integer and pack it up again. So we use this expression:</p>

<p><code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(2).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code><br>
<code>[100+ (effect(""scale ctrl"")(""Point"")[0]-100)*shapeIndex, 100+ (effect(""scale ctrl"")(""Point"")[1]-100)*shapeIndex];</code></p>

<p>If we only wanted uniform scale we could use a slider Expression Control effect, and the the same sort of expression we use for rotation:</p>

<p><code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(2).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code><br>
<code>(effect(""scale ctrl"")(""Slider"")/100)*shapeIndex;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Lastly we want to control the colour. Colour in AE is a four-element array [R, G, B, Alpha]. The individual components of the array are decimals from 0 to 1, where 1 is full on and 0 is off. So red is [1,0,0], yellow is [1,1,0] and mid grey is [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]. What you want to do with colour is up to you, but here's a demo. It fades out from red to green, with random variation on the blue channel. </p>

<p>Note that the shapeIndex definition in this expression is different. That's because the <code>color</code> property is nested down a level inside the <code>fill</code> property, so we have to use <code>propertyGroup(3)</code> instead of <code>propertyGroup(2)</code>.</p>

<p><code>shapeIndex=thisProperty.propertyGroup(3).name.split("" "")[1]-1;</code><br>
<code>seedRandom(shapeIndex, timeless = true);</code><br>
<code>r=value[0]-shapeIndex/25.6;</code><br>
<code>g=value[1]+shapeIndex/25.6;</code><br>
<code>b=random()</code><br>
<code>[r , g, b, 255]</code></p>

<p>The <code>seedRandom</code> function creates a new, unchanging random number for each copy. If the <code>timeless=true</code> part is changed to <code>timeless=false</code> the random number will change with every frame. Another randomising function is the <code>wiggle</code> function, that softly changes values over time.</p></li>
<li><p>So now your shape layer should have two shape objects in it, and the second one will have expressions like this:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cB29y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Here's where the magic happens</strong></p></li>
<li>Now duplicate that second shape. If all goes well you should see new copies with offset, rotation and scale controlled by the expression control effects (make sure you have sane amounts for these values - the offset for example will default to half the width of the comp, which will move your duplicates out of sight. Try setting it to something like 50, 50 to start with). It should look something like the image at the start. Below is how the layer looks. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0H7ID.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the cool things about doing it this way is that the expression is actually based on the name of the shape object. So the layer order doesn't matter. As you can see here, the copies are in front of the original, I can move them around so that they're behind, or individually move them up or down. Using the name is a little bit kludgy though. If I rename one of the shapes I might break all the expressions that control it.</p>

<p>If that's all too hard to read, <a href=""https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5408802B7CF7224B!47711&amp;authkey=!ACkuHMqDVQ6SPYA&amp;ithint=file%2Czip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's the project</a></p>

"Premiere Elements ""Debug Event"": Keyframe error","3298","","<p>I have encountered a probable bug in Premiere Elements 10, and fortunately I've also found a workaround which is why I wrote my own answer below. But since I haven't been able to solve the underlying problem, I'd be very glad for additional ideas on how to fix the problem. Now here's the question:</p>

<p>How can I salvage a Premiere Elements project file (.prel) that can't be opened because of the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Premiere Elements Debug Event
Premiere Elements has encountered an error:
[d:\pre\mediacore\mediafoundation\api\inc\Keyframe/Keyframe.h-142]
</code></pre>

<p>This error appears to occur sporadically on non-US versions of Windows. There is no previous indication during the editing session that anything may be wrong (saves and auto-saves work fine), but on the next restart, the project can't be opened. Other projects appear to be unaffected. </p>

<p>According to other users who have seen the same error (Google for ""premiere debug keyframe"" and you'll find some), there might be some connection with the introduction of DVD menus into the project, but I'm just speculating here.</p>
","<p>Analyzing the files that fail to open in contrast to those that do open just fine shows one glaring problem: All lines in the <code>project.prel</code> file (which is just an XML file) where there should be decimal numbers in <code>&lt;StartKeyframe&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Keyframe&gt;</code> tags are damaged. Example: </p>

<p>Correct version:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;StartKeyframe&gt;-91445760000000000,100.,0,0,0.,0.,0.,0.&lt;/StartKeyframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Defective version:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;StartKeyframe&gt;-91445760000000000,100,,0,0,0,,0,,0,,0,&lt;/StartKeyframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So apparently Premiere Elements at some point got confused by European locale settings and decided to save decimal values using the European decimal separator (comma) instead of the US decimal separator (dot). Of course it's then impossible to open that file correctly ever again.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at least in my tests, there are only three kinds of decimal values in <code>.prel</code> files:</p>

<ol>
<li>integer floats: <code>1.</code>, <code>0.</code>, <code>100.</code></li>
<li>the single value <code>0.5</code> </li>
<li>double precision floats: <code>0.16666666666666666</code>, <code>1.000000000000000000000000</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This makes it possible to fix the file using a regular expression replace. If your editor supports Perl-style regular expressions, you can search for</p>

<pre><code>,(?:(?=[,&lt;]|\d{10})|(?&lt;=\b0,)(?=5\b))
</code></pre>

<p>and replace all with</p>

<pre><code>.
</code></pre>

<p>This will replace all erroneous decimal commas (i. e. those that are either followed by another comma, an opening angle bracket, a decimal fraction of at least 10 digits, or the number 5 (but only if that comma is preceded by the single digit 0)) with a decimal point.</p>

<p>After that (be sure to back up your <code>.prel</code> file before you do this!), the file can be opened again correctly. However, as soon as it's saved again, the error is re-introduced.</p>

<p>Therefore, if someone has an idea how to actually fix this problem instead of patching it up with an admittedly wonky regex, I'd be most grateful.</p>

<hr>

<p>One hint as to what the underlying problem might be: Around the time the error was introduced, Premiere spontaneously opened a little dialog window that said (in German) something like</p>

<pre><code>""Premiere Elements is updating a component. Information is being transmitted...""
</code></pre>

<p>While this window was displayed, two Win7 UAC boxes popped up, asking me to allow the Windows Regserver to update my system. The actual commands it needed approval for were</p>

<pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /s 
   ""C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 10\mc_dec_mpa_ds.ax"" 
   ""C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 10\mc_dec_mp2v_ds.ax""
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\regsvr32.exe /s 
   ""C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 10\32\mc_dec_mpa_ds.ax"" 
   ""C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 10\32\mc_dec_mp2v_ds.ax""
</code></pre>

<p>(line breaks inserted for clarity). </p>

<p>The first time around, I allowed these actions (which in retrospect may have been a bad idea...); now this happens every time I'm trying to open a ""patched"" project file. It doesn't matter whether I now allow or refuse it - either way, Premiere writes a corrupted project file when I save my project.</p>

"Encoding DNxHD using ffmbc","3264","","<p>I have decided to re-encode my footage as DNxHD for editing. I am using ffmbc (<a href=""http://www.videohelp.com/tools/ffmbc/old-versions"" rel=""nofollow"">downloaded here</a>) to do the encoding. My source footage is HDV 1080i50.</p>

<p>Therefore I think the best format to trancode into would be DNxHD 1080i50. According to <a href=""http://itbroadcastanddigitalcinema.com/ffmpeg_howto.html#Encoding_VC-3"" rel=""nofollow"">this document</a> ffmpeg (which ffmbc is derived from) has a limited selection of formats of which 1080i50 is one.</p>

<p>Here is the command I am using (%1 and %2 are the in and out filenames):</p>

<pre><code>ffmbc -i %1 -s 1920x1080 -vcodec dnxhd -b 185M -mbd rd -tff -acodec copy -threads 0 %2
</code></pre>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To encode interlaced media I need to specify -tff or -bff. I don't really understand the difference. Which would be the best to choose? Currently I have chosen tff as that is how the source is encoded.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any benefit to doing a two pass encode? My understanding of a two pass encode is that it helps keep the bit-rate constant. Is that helpful for editing. I can do a two pass encode with the following command, but it's so slow I'm wondering if it's necessary?</p>

<p>ffmbc -i %1 -s 1920x1080 -vcodec dnxhd -b 185M -mbd rd -tff -an -f rawvideo -an -threads 0 -y NUL
ffmbc -i %1 -s 1920x1080 -vcodec dnxhd -b 185M -mbd rd -tff -acodec copy -threads 0 %2</p></li>
<li><p>My source is actually encoded as 1440x1080i. Can any one comment on the drop in quality when converting to 1920x1080i. (I believe that the image will still be the same size but the source has wider pixels)</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>1) If you're not going to deinterlace it then stick to the source's field order.</p>

<p>2) I wouldn't bother with the two pass encoding (if indeed it even does anything) - dnxhd will only encode at certain specific fixed bit rates anyway so you're actually pretty constrained for options.</p>

<p>3) You'll see some softening, but it's unavoidable.  ffmbc's filtering is ok though.</p>

<p>What software are you editing in?</p>

<p>And the 185M bitrate might be overkill if your source is HDV.  Try 120M and save yourself a bit of space.</p>

"Cross-dissolve in real time between end and start point of looping clip","3248","","<p>I'm trying to achieve the following: I have a short movie clip that I want to loop for an indefinite amount of time. However, as of now, it doesn't particularly good every time the clip starts over (it just sort of jitters back to the starting point without any form of smooth transition), so I would need a cross-dissolve effect to be applied to it in realtime.</p>

<p>Is there any (preferably free) software solution that could help me accomplish what I want to do here? Preferably, I'd like some kind of free solution that works both across Windows and OS X, but tips relating to the platforms individually are appreciated as well. I don't care whether I need some stand alone software to achieve this (as opposed to using some kind of plug-in for a program that I'm already using, like VLC).</p>
","<p>You can't seamlessly loop a clip that wasn't designed to loop. Some suggestions below, but all require video editing software. No plugin for a player that I know of.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Clip has a distinctive/necessary beginning &amp; end that have to be seen, or has audio/narration that cannot be edited or shortened</h3>

<p>The best option in this case would be to edit the clip to fade-in from and fade-out to black (and/or an identical image) at the beginning &amp; end. </p>

<p>Now when it loops it at least appears the same (even if the player hiccups slightly). Black works well since most players go to black after finishing a clip.  </p>

<h3>Option 2: No audio, the clip's start/end location doesn't matter &amp; you want a seamless loop</h3>

<p>In this case you could try the following, using whatever software - iMovie, Premiere, After Effects, MovieMaker etc...</p>

<ul>
<li>Place the entire clip on a timeline.</li>
<li>Duplicate the clip.</li>
<li>Find a point in the clip that has as little motion/change as possible.</li>
<li>On the top copy of the clip, move 1 frame to the <em>left</em> and trim everything <em>after</em> this point.</li>
<li>On the bottom copy, go back to the chosen frame and trim everything <em>before</em> this point.</li>
<li>Move the <em>bottom</em> copy left so it starts at the beginning of the timeline 
<ul>
<li>Your chosen point now starts at 0:00:00 </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shift the top copy to the right until it only overlaps slightly with the bottom copy.
<ul>
<li>The original start/end points are now overlapping somewhere in the middle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a cross-dissolve to the beginning of the top copy
<ul>
<li>The original end point will be obscured by the dissolve. </li>
<li>Experiment w/the length and location of overlap/dissolve to find a suitable result. It could work w/just a few frames, or might require a longer overlap to not look jumpy. How well it works depends on how different the original start/end frames are. </li>
<li>Ensure the dissolve only occurs during overlapping frames or else you'll see clips jumping on &amp; off screen. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trim the end of the timeline so it stops exactly at the last frame of the top clip.<br>
<ul>
<li>Your edited video will be shorter by the length of the dissolve.</li>
<li>The new last frame is now exactly 1 frame <em>before</em> the new first frame at the beginning. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Export timeline to your required format  </li>
</ul>

<p>The result of this process is that the beginning and end now only  differ by a single frame, making a loop with minimal jump when you restart playback. The cross-dissolve in the middle takes care of the smooth transition that you don't currently have, at the expense of ~1 second of original length.</p>

<p>You could also flip the directions around so the top clip shows the original ""end"" point clearly &amp; fades to the ""start"" of the bottom clip. Either way works...  </p>

<p>There still may be a slight stutter no matter what, depending on the delivery platform. VLC is decent about looping, but iTunes and WMP have a noticeable gap even in a clip that should be seamless. If your clip is for DVD there might be a slight pause, but visually it would look the same.</p>

<p>If the video is for web or mobile use, it'll depend on the platform. iOS and Android are horrible about looping videos natively (there's always a noticeable gap while it restarts, if looping is allowed at all). With HTML5 video or Flash you could code it to seek to the beginning immediately before it reaches the end, hopefully preventing much stutter and avoiding the need to go to all this editing hassle...</p>

<p>I hope this helps!  </p>

"Burn a single HD video into a DVD without losing quality","3241","","<p>I created a video (slideshow of 14.2MP photos and music) using Windows Live Movie Maker. The video's resolution is 1440x1080 and is as WMV with 840MB.</p>

<p>Now what I want is to <strong>burn that HD video (no menus, no other videos) into a DVD so it can be playable on any DVD player and watchable on a TV</strong>. Is there any way to burn it without losing quality? I tried <em>Nero</em>, <em>Windows Live Movie Maker burn dvd option</em> and <em>Wondershare DVD Creator</em>. The video quality got worse in all of them (Nero's being the worse and Wondershare's the better) with loss of sharpness, sometimes minor jpeg artifacts and some color changes.</p>

<li>the DVD still has 3.80GB free, so why compressing it?</li>
<li>the movie DVD's image quality is great so what are they using to do it?</li>

","<p>The short answer is ""No.""  DVD by definition is limited to 720x480 video with a fairly low bitrate, compressed specifically with MPEG-2.  There is absolutely no way to make your HD video look just as good with those constraints.</p>

<p>Some DVD players do let you play .mp4, .mkv, or whatever files that happen to be stored on a DVD, but that isn't a standard function of DVD players in general.</p>

"Why not filming computer or TV screens?","3149","","<p>I see this all the time: a character is doing something on a computer or watching TV. Instead of filming the actual content of the screen, they film the scene with a fixed camera and add a layer with the content they want to show during post production.</p>

<p>Here is an example (from a TV series named Underemployed, Season 1 episode 1 at 18:42). <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hX76B.png"" alt=""screen changed at post production""></p>

<p>In this case, you can see that the perpective correction is wrong (the bottom right corner doesn't match the actual corner of the screen), and I'm really wondering what I'm looking at. It looks like a deformed iPad application displayed on a cheap PC, I really don't know.</p>

<p>What kind of problems occur when you film an LCD ? Is it a technical issue, or is there another problem I'm not thinking of ? Maybe a logistic problem (like.. the actor doesn't know how to use a computer, or they should synchronize the actors play with the content played on the TV..).</p>
","<p>There are several factors that comes to play with recording computer screens.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As filzilla already mentions, sync is a major factor. In the old days CRT monitors was very challenging to film even with sync-locking. Depending on if you filmed on silver or on video you did get different results. With the exception of LED screens, LCDs also offer sync problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The other factor is light conditions. For movie scene you usually have a large amount of light which a computer screen is unable to produce - so the screen turns very dark. You also get problems with color-correction/white-balance as the monitor typically have a different color temperature than the lights used to lit the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>The third factor is of more recent nature and has to do with the nature of LCD screen and it's polarization, referring to the limited angle they are visible within. You will get ""gradient"" effects and on more poor screens also have limited visibility from the sides, top and bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>Moiré can be a problem. For video this isn't such a big problem because the light coming from the screen will blend the pixels. Unless you have a high resolution camera filming in low(er) light conditions, or are filming close-up (but not so close that you can actually see the screen pixels), the camera won't be able to separate the individual pixels. For movie cameras this is more present though due the higher resolutions and the requirement to light conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there is content synchronization with the actor's interactions or the scene in general, the potential of typos, wrong clicks, having to reset for each take and so forth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's more easy to put in a video in post which you can color correct and adjust, synchronize and so forth to the movie.</p>

<p>The process isn't very complicated. The computer screen is often recorded with a green or blue backdrop to eliminate the need for mask/matte rotoscoping. You just track the corners of the inner part of the screen and drop in a keyed replacement for the screen.</p>

<p>There are plugins too that do a pretty decent job automating this process (or instance the Mocha AE and its planar tracking).</p>

"Using a Flash to Light Video","3131","","<p>I have a Nikon D3100. It has a built in flash.  Can I use it as a light when filming videos?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, it is not possible to use a camera flash as a light for video.  A true flash is a high intensity discharge bulb which produces a very short (1/100 second or shorter), very bright burst of light.  It is not designed to be used for constant light output and has insufficient power, durability or cooling to be able to operate as a continuous light source.</p>

<p>Some devices, most often smartphones, use LED light sources as a ""flash"" but actually are not flashes, simply constant output lamps that can be used for video or as a low brightness ""flash"" for still images.  This is very rare to see with a point and shoot or DSLR.  When it is included with DSLR flashes, it is typically as a separate, distinct light on the same unit, such as the video light built in the Canon's 320EX flash.</p>

","<p>You are lucky that you don't have extreme lighting conditions in your shot, also you're indoors. So it should definitely be possible to get the footage a bit darker looking without making it look weird.
I can recommend working in After Effects rather than Premiere, its far more suited for advanced lighting correction.</p>

<p>I would start by masking the already dark areas of your footage and make them even darker. Try to create a more focused looking light that's coming from the light bulb/screen or whatever light source you want to have. If you want to create new light sources you will also have to make some masks to emulate the way the light would shine on the surrounding objects.
The whole part behind the chair should be a lot darker.
Generally make everything that is already in a shadowy area even darker and lower the brightness of the image overall to a point that feels good.</p>

","<p>I'm with AJ. Unless you know the characteristics of every player that might view this, it would be unwise to rely on a small sample of test results. Using a standard frame rate like 24 fps with a keyframe interval of 24 frames will give you essentially the same thing with no compromise in compatibility.

"Blur whole text and then ""unblur"" part of it","2980","","<p>I have a text in after effects that I wish to first blur the whole thing and then animate it so that a part of the text is clear.</p>

<p>If I have the text <code>Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna.</code></p>

<p>First the whole text is blurred. Then it animates and at the end just the last part <code>non magna</code> is blurred.</p>

<p>So far I've used the blur function by going to my <code>Text Layer</code> > <code>Animate</code> > <code>Blur</code>. I've tried doing the thing I want by setting keyframes for the <code>Range Selector</code> properties but I can't get it right.</p>
","<p>What you need to do is to use a regular blur effect. You also have to apply the effect to an adjustment layer. I'll explain why later on. Why don't I just make a recipe for you to follow first, and then I'll explain what's going on! :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Make your text layer and fill it with text.</li>
  <li>Make an Adjustment Layer. (Layer -> New -> Adjustment Layer)</li>
  <li>Make sure the Adjustment Layer is selected, and go Effect -> Blur -> Test some of them (Gaussian Blur is very common.)</li>
  <li>Go to the Effect Controls panel to set the blur to what you want it to be.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What is happening now, is that the Adjustment Layer is blurring all the layers below it. So if you have other layers below, you may need to Pre-Compose the two layers so that the Adjustment Layer doesn't affect more than the text layer. And the reason why we are using an Adjustment Layer, is that now we can either animate the layer away to reveal the naked text layer, or we can animate a mask to do the same thing. If you use a mask, you can add a feather that will make it look much better in most cases.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can make two copies of the text, one with the blur directly on it, and one without any blur at all. Then you could animate the mask of the naked text layer to reveal it, but this is a bit difficult if you are animating the text or something like that, because you'll have to do exactly the same on both layers...</p>

<p>Here I'll explain how to do it with the Adjustment Layer with a mask.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Select the Adjustment Layer and select the Rectangle tool from the top toolbar, and draw a rectangle covering the whole of the text.</li>
  <li>Press M to open the mask settings on the layer. Now you can set the feather to what you want it to be.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Move the mask a bit to the right to see how the effect will look like. Remember also that when you are adding feather, you'll have to make the mask bigger because the mask will fade away in the corners...</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Animate the mask as you please. Tell me if you want me to explain how to do this! :)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to have more layers below the text layer, you need to Pre-Compose it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Select both the layers, right-click and select Pre-Compose.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That's it! Good luck with your movie :)</p>

"Do I need to convert 60fps to 30fps so it will be reproducible?","2979","","<p>I just bought a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition.  I have been testing out two modes: 1080p at 30fps and 720p at 60fps.</p>

<p>I have noticed that when reproducing the videos with 720p at 60fps they are not really smooth, they seem a little bit weird (I have used VLC to reproduce them). So, a friend of mine suggested me to convert them to 30fps and then they will be slow motion, and later on speed them up 50% with Adobe Premier.  After doing that, they look better.</p>

<p>I am confused. Why does this happen? Why do I need to low them down to 30fps and then speed them up up to 50%? Wouldn't that mean that we are back to 60fps?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>You're not back to 60fps, you're still at 30fps but with every other frame discarded (or blended, or interlaced, depending on how the speedup is accomplished). </p>

<p>When you discard every other frame, you're trading off temporal resolution. If you interlace, you're trading off spatial resolution.</p>

<p>Either way, if this appears smoother, something's wrong with the way the 60fps is being presented. Your playback system may not be able to keep up with the data rate or frame rate. If 1080/30 looks OK, then it's probably not a data rate issue.</p>

"How can I add a transition between two cuts of the same clip in Premiere Pro CS5?","2974","","<p>I've run into what I think is a bug in Premiere Pro CS5.  I've got one large clip that was pulled from an analog camera, and I'm cutting it into scenes.  When I try to add a transition between two such scenes, it just doesn't work.  If I do a two second clock wipe, for instance, I can see the hand of the clock rotating, but I just see the left image for one second, then a sudden cut to the right image for one second, with no transition.  Can anyone confirm that this is a bug, and is there a workaround?  Thanks.</p>

"Is it right time to buy 4K video camera?","2971","","<p>I want to casual shooting (family, travels etc.), but I do not want to sacrifice the quality.</p>

<p>Should I buy a camera equipped with 4K shooting? Is it the right time to buy a 4K camera or should I buy a 1080p now and may be after 2-3 years I will buy 4K.</p>

<p>From my perspective, 4K is still not evolved, it will take another 3-4 years to reach its peak and that's when I think more and more cameras will be available with affordable price.</p>
","<p>You will pay substantially more for a good 4k camera right now than you would for a good 1080p camera. Quality =/= resolution, there are phones that can shoot in 4k but the videos will look a lot worse than a 1080p video from a dedicated 1080p camcorder/dslr, the image quality depends on a lot of factors.
A bigger sensor for example has the ability to capture a lot more light and have much more accurate colors than a tiny sensor that only captures very few photons per pixel.
The video compression used by the camera is also a big factor, even with h264 there can be huge quality differences between cameras depending on the encoding settings of the camera.</p>

<p>The question you should also ask yourself, what do you get from a 4k resolution when you mostly shoot things that are meant to be memories that you don't already get with 1080p.</p>

<p>My advise would be to not think about 4k and look for a nice 1080p camera. Even in commercial video there is not that much to gain with 4k video right now and probably not even in the future, we are reaching resolutions that don't necessarily improve the image quality for every content. It really depends on what you shoot and most importantly how big your screen is and how far you sit away from it. Right now there are quite a few living room configurations where its already hard for a lot of people to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p.</p>

"How Can I Reduce Noise On a 5D Mk3?","2956","","<p>The internet is full to bursting with comparisons of noise on the 5D Mk3 at different ISOs, but there is next to nothing about how to reduce noise or work with it / around it.</p>

<p>I am experiencing noise across all ISO settings, but obviously worse the higher I go. I never shoot above 800 and try and stay as low as possible. I am careful not to underexpose, but I still get a fizzy noise in the midtones and shadows.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the 5D is flawed when it comes to video and I don't need to be told how a dedicated video camera will achieve better results; I am a stills photographer and I don't want to buy a second camera.</p>

<p><strong>So given the known limitations of the 5D Mk3, how can I shoot to reduce the noise and what workflows are best for removing noise in post?</strong></p>

<p><em>I am shooting Cinestyle and will soon be shooting RAW via Magic Lantern.</em></p>
","<p>Certainly using RAW on ML will help.  With 14 bit color, your noise reduction options are a lot more advanced.  Traditional noise reduction that you are used to from photos can be used with video as well using either color grading software or editing software.  (With RAW video, it would be in the color grading software before mixing down to processed clips.)  Additionally, with RAW, you won't have the encoding artifact which you may be misinterpreting as noise as well.</p>

<p>That said, how bad of noise are you getting.  I'm in the reverse situation of you.  I started as a video guy and switched to photography and got the 5D Mark iii because of it's strengths in both areas.  You should not be getting significant noise issues below 800 ISO on your 5D Mark iii unless something is wrong.  The 5D Mark iii shoots outstanding video and with RAW is compared fairly closely (though still noticeably different from) much more expensive cameras like the C300 or even some lower end ARRI cameras.</p>

<p>It is generally applauded for it's high video quality and good low light video capability.  Can you post a sample that demonstrates the problem you are seeing?  I wonder if there might be some other issue causing your problems as my 5D Mark iii doesn't give what I would consider unreasonable noise levels on video even at ISOs like 3200 or even 6400 in some lighting conditions.</p>

<p>ISO 3200 video frame grab</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iHzmX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There is some noise, but it's pretty limited, particularly considering this is in the shadows under a desk, inside, with no other light other than what was coming in through the window above the table.  There are some newer cameras in the same or lower price range that have slightly improved on the capability, but the 5D mark iii is still one of the top contenders last time I looked around.</p>

<p>Other than that, the easiest option, like Jason Conrad mentioned, is to use more light and lower numbered ISO.  </p>

"Help with playback stutter in Sony Vegas Pro 11","2954","","<p>I've got 2 DSLRs in my kit, a Nikon D7000 and a Nikon D3S, for 1080i and 720p respectively. I experienced stuttering playback with footage from both cameras, and figured it was something with Nikon's codec until I had the same issue with HDV footage from a Sony camera (client was unsure of the model#). I recently upgraded from Vegas 8 to Vegas 11 to handle HD footage more cleanly. My machine has 6gb RAM, one of the recommended NVidia graphics cards, and my CPU, while slower than I'd like at 2.53GHHz, is still within recommended ranges for Vegas 11. My internal discs are spinning @ 7200RPM &amp; I'm running Win7 Pro. I've downloaded all the latest drivers, codecs and updates that I could find for my hardware and software.</p>

<p>So here's more detail on what I've tried:
Playback in Vegas 11 Pro stutters for both the Nikon and and Sony HD footage. 
SD footage plays back just fine. 
Only picture stutters, not sound. 
Stutter happens at all playback resolutions, from draft to highest quality. 
If I view the clips in an external player (Quicktime, VLC, DivX) playback is fine.
If I render out a clip to Quicktime, AVI, Windows Media, MPG2, MPG4 at HD resolution, or at least matching the camera clip as closest as I can, I can pull it back into Vegas and play it without any issues. </p>

<p>Based on the above facts:
It's appears to be a Vegas issue, and since playback after rendering THROUGH Vegas works fine, I suspect it's an issue with the Nikon codecs on the inbound side. But, what's up with the Sony playback stuttering? Maybe it's hard drive speed issue? Then why do rendered clips, some of which are larger than the original, not stutter?</p>

<p>I never did any setup from within Vegas to point it to the GPU. I assume that Vegas will FIND my GPU and assign whatever processes as it sees fit. DO I need to do something special?</p>

<p>Has anyone else had success with Nikon clips, and would you be willing to share your setup parameters?</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>
","<p>I have seen some trainwrecks by combining Nikon .mov with Vegas Pro 10. After tech calls into both Nikon and Sony it was determined that my machine didn't have enough resources.</p>

<p>I need to upgrade from 32 bit to a 64 bit version of Win7, plus I need to go from a quad core to an i7, and from 4GB to 12 GB or better. I can use my Nikon files now but only if I keep the total under 1 GB, short projects only but it works. One thing that may help your stuttered preview is to set the window to preview mode at 1/4 size, this helped a lot for me.</p>

<p>Here is a tutorial that covers everything I've tried and more of the things that may help you
get your playback smoother.</p>

"Recommendable production codecs for Adobe video products","2936","","<p>I'm currently searching for new codecs that are better suited for production than the ones we are currently using. So far we used QuickTime Animation and PhotoJPEG. The latter always proved as something ""rocksolid"" and never made any problems. Though its lossy and has no alpha, thats when we used Animation but that codec is a dinosaur when it comes to compression and bit-depth.
I generally dislike all the built-in QuickTime codecs as they either dont deliver all the formats options or are just not pracitcal in a multi OS workflow. The whole Pro-Res family is a no go as it can only be encoded on a mac (except for the beta version of the ffdshow ProRes encoder).</p>

<p>So far I'm very happy with JPEG2000 using the j2k plugin from fnordware, the format has all the good things from legacy JPEG and Animation and has even more features but the downside is the fact that its an image sequence which is not so nice to handle as a single container file. The crippled JPEG2000 codec in QuickTime is no option.</p>

<p>So what I'm searching is a codec that can be used with container formats like .avi or .mov (or any other container, it really doesn't matter), with a good compressability in the range of lossless JPEG2000, atleast 16bit per channel and support for an alpha channel. E: And of course lossless if that wasn't clear so far. Otional lossy compression like JPEG2000 has, would be great but not necessary.</p>

<p>I hope someone can suggest me something, its no problem if the format needs a plugin for After Effects, Premiere etc. it just needs to be compatible with CS6 and not be restricted to Windows or Mac.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://umezawa.dyndns.info/archive/utvideo/?C=M;O=D"" rel=""nofollow"">Ut Video</a> is an editor friendly lossless video codec and is a good choice for in house production as an intermediary.

You can install it on Windows and it will show up in Adobe Media Encoder, After Effects, etc. I don't know if it will fit all of your needs, but it is worth a try.</p>

"Why does HDMI out on my Canon 5D Mark III work with my TV but not my Lilliput monitor or BlackMagic Design Shuttle 2?","2902","","<p>Facts as I observe them:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can use a mini-HDMI to HDMI cord to mirror my Canon 5D Mark III on my consumer Samsung television</li>
<li>I can use a consumer HDMI device such as an Apple TV to power my Lilliput monitor and capture over my BlackMagic Design Shuttle 2 -> UltraStudio Mini Recorder setup</li>
<li>I cannot use my Canon 5D Mark III to run HDMI over the  Shuttle 2 -> Mini Recorder</li>
</ul>

<p>The video is set to 1920x1080 with 30fps. I know the BlackMagic devices like <code>720p59.94</code> and  and <code>1080p59.94</code>.  I have up-to-date <code>1.3.3</code> Canon firmware and have default settings except for <code>HDMI output + LCD</code> setting which is set to <code>Mirroring</code>. I am set to <code>P</code> mode. </p>

<p>I've established a Computer&lt;->Mini Recorder setup in multiple applications using the working input so I believe the issue to be between the camera and the devices receiving its HDMI out. The behavior of the camera seems to change when I plug its output into one of the non-working sources, apparently leaving movie mode. When connected to the monitor and I turn it off, the display returns from black.</p>

<p>My guess here is that the TV is capable of some wildly varying HDMI standards while my camera and/or BlackMagic gear is not. It may not be capable of handling whatever <code>1920x1080 30fps IPB</code> output ends up being.  <a href=""https://forums.creativecow.net/thread/280/376"" rel=""nofollow"">This seems relevant</a>:</p>

  <p>-Has nothing to do with HDCP compliance, not required, so that is good.</p>
  
  <p>-If you have a display that does not work at 1080 in the live view mode with the Canon 5D Mark II it is probably attributable to one of
  two things: Native preferred timing not set to 1920x1080i in monitor's
  EDID or that the display type is listed as RGB color and default color
  space is listed as sRGB in the monitor's EDID.</p>

","<p>Which Lilliput monitor do you have and what exactly is the output format of the 5d Mkiii? </p>

<p>Not all Lilliput screens can display progressive resolutions. Sometimes cameras provide ""fake"" interlaced on the monitor out (PsF) even if recording progressive to avoid that problem. It is a common problem with the BM Pocket Cinema Camera and (some) Lilliput screens since the BMPCC only outputs 24p/25p/30p.</p>

<li>Hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> to make sure that the line, which you are going to create is 'straight'</li>
<li>Click into the viewer again to set the 'end point'</li>

<p>This will create a new <strong>Shape Layer</strong>. If the layer is selected you can adjust the 'stoke color' and the 'thickness' in the <em>Tool Bar</em>:</p>

"What is the most lossless way to rip a laserdisc to a Mac?","2887","","<p>I want to rip a LD to my Mac as a digital video file. I will create a DVD from this file eventually, but I'm primarily interested in playing it on my laptop. What video output from the Laserdisc player would you use? And what hardware and software would you use to import to a Mac? What settings (image resolution, audio sample rate) would capture the best quality—without going over the top? (Clearly 4k would be overdoing it for the analog LD, but MPEG-2 might introduce compression artifacts that I don't want to see unless I make a DVD.)</p>

<p>An accepted answer will include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Recommendation for video output from LD player</li>
<li>Recommended capture hardware</li>
<li>Recommended capture software</li>
<li>Recommended file format</li>
</ul>
","<p>Generally, I would expect that just about any solution will work pretty well now.  The capabilities of even cheap modern hardware so far outpace the capability of laserdisc that you aren't likely to lose much.  Certainly a professional quality capture system similar to the ones Matrox sells would do a superb job, but I'd hazard that even a cheap $30 USB to composite capture device would do the job sufficiently well.  You should be able to use whatever software comes with the capture device.</p>

<p>You will want to capture using the composite output rather than the S-video output since the Laserdisc is natively Composite.  I would capture to a standard DV codec if you have the option for one.  If not, a basic h.264 file is also a fine option.  You may also want to run a 2 pass h.264 compression from your DV capture to minimize the file size while keeping quality high.  (DV files are rather space consuming, but they are very high quality SD files.)  You can use FFMPEG or Handbrake for the transcoding if you want a free option.  x264 is a highly popular h.264 codec available in both.</p>

<p>Truly the most lossless way would be to use an actual lossless format, but that is excessive given the highly limited quality of Laserdisc to begin with.  That's why I recommended DV as a balance of space and quality.</p>

<p>I want to keep the 4 audio tracks synched with the video track as I cut and rearrange the footage. Using Premiere CC, how would I link the multiple audio tracks to the single video track?</p>
","<p>You can link multiple clips as you would link two clips. First, put all the audio and video tracks you want in your timeline and arrange them using the timecodes, manual adjustments or however you prefer to align the individual recordings (I'm assuming you have a method for that, since you removed that part of the question in the last edit). Then select all clips that you want to link, right-click on one of them and select ""link"" (if some of them are already linked, you will only see an ""unlink"" option, in that case unlink them, select them again and then link them alltogether). You could also choose to group them, which yields a slightly different effect.</p>

<p>One more tip: In the program preferences under ""Generel"", you have the option ""Display out of sync indicators for unlinked clips"", which will show you when clips you linked at some point are out of sync even if you unlinked them later on.

<p>Trial and error.  A lut is really just a starting point for your grade.  Try some different ones out.  If it absolutely butchers the color, then it's probably not a good place to start.  If you see clipping or banding, then you've chosen a lut which was meant for a different situation.  As you try each one, look at the trace on a waveform monitor and vector scope.  If anything goes out of bounds, pick something else.  Do you notice any kind of granularity, banding, or stair-stepping in the traces?  Look for one that's more even.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">VirtualDub</a> is a very powerful video editor. However, it's not very intuitive to use it and it has a steep learning curve. On the plus side, there's a large internet community that supports it, so lots of online resources are available.</p>

<p>For your specific problem I've made a short tutorial below. I've done all steps in Windows XP with two .mov files from a Canon 550D. Unfortunately I failed to find an easy way of adjusting white balance with VirtualDub.<br>
I've used various on-line resources to compile this tutorial. There might be a more optimal way of doing this, but I found this the most straight forward.</p>

<h3>Installing VirtualDub + plugins</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualdub/files/virtualdub-experimental/1.10.3.35390/VirtualDub-1.10.3.zip/download"" rel=""nofollow"">VirtualDub 1.10.3</a>.</li>

<li>Place the contents of the plugin folder of ffinputdriver in the plugin folder found in the VirtualDub folder.</li>
<li>Start VirtualDub</li>
<li>First you'll need to convert your video to AVI. That's what VirtualDub works with natively. A warning: my 1280x720 .mov file of 25MB became a 600MB .avi file.
The transcoding speed is dependent on your machine.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Transcoding .mov to .avi</h3>

<ol>
<li><code>File -&gt; Open video file</code>  </li>
<li><code>File -&gt; Save segmented AVI</code>  </li>
<li>Repeat for all your files.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Adjust Saturation</h3>

<ol>
<li><code>File -&gt; Open video file</code>. Choose one of the AVI files you generated in the previous step.</li>
<li>The video file opens in two screens. The left is the original, the right one is the processed video. At first they should be identical. You can scale the video views by right-clicking on them and choosing an appropriate zoom percentage.</li>
<li>Go to <code>Video</code> and check if <code>Full processing mode</code> is on.</li>
<li>Go to <code>Video -&gt; Filters -&gt; Add -&gt; HSV Adjust</code>.</li>
<li>Adjust the saturation to your liking and hit <code>OK</code>. Hit <code>OK</code> again in the filter window.</li>
<li>Click <code>File -&gt; Save segmented AVI...</code> and save the edited file somewhere.</li>
<li>Repeat the process for all your videos in need of saturation adjustments.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Combine clips into one longer clip</h3>

<ol>
<li><code>File -&gt; Open video file</code>. Choose the first file of your sequence.</li>
<li><code>File -&gt; Append AVI segment</code>. The selected video file will be appended to the end of the open file.</li>
<li>Repeat this with all the video files.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Export to smaller file</h3>

<ol>
<li>Follow the steps outlined <a href=""https://frapsforum.com/threads/virtualdub-save-direct-to-mp4-fraps-to-youtube-with-external-encoders.2446/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.<br>

"Post-production workflow: VFX before color correction?","2824","","<p>I'm shooting my first internet video tomorrow. It has a spaceship chasing and shooting at a superhero in it. With knowledge accumulated between ~a year ago and now and more focused research over the past week, my idea of post-production workflow for a VFX video in the style of FreddieW or Corridor Digital YouTube channels is something like this (prerequisite: I am talking about color correction as getting all shots into a uniform look color-wise, and color grading as getting the feeling you want from the color):</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit raw shots into a sequence, and lock them there.</li>
<li>Do music, sound and VFX. Go through each shot in the video and add VFX elements, matching them to the shot's lighting, exposure, color, shadows, ...</li>
<li>Go through each composited shot and color correct and grade it.</li>
<li>Replace shots in locked edit with composited and color corrected and graded shots.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have now these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this workflow ""correct""? Are there many ""correct""'s (is it mutable)?</li>
<li>You're supposed to shoot in as low contrast and saturation as you can (this is called flat?) to make color correction easier, like you have a blank, unbiased canvas to ""pull"" the colors out of, right?</li>
<li>This is the real core of my question: how can you match VFX elements to flat footage when there's no amplified color detail to work with? Can I color correct before VFX, and leave color grading where it is?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Any workflow that works for you is ""correct"".  I don't see any obvious problems with your proposed workflow, though I would think you would want to do sound after VFX so that it can be properly timed to the VFX.  Depending on the software you are using, you may not have to lock the shots but may actually be able to move directly in to working on the shots.</p>

<p>As far as low contrast and low saturation, I would personally disagree with shooting for low contrast/low saturation.  This limits the depth of your available color space too much.  Your camera has a limited number of colors it can describe, if you ignore a large portion of that color space, then you can't describe as many colors and the resolution of your color after boosting the saturation and contrast will be very greatly reduced.  That said, if you have issues with lacking detail in your shadows, exposing it up in to mid-tones can help since your format doesn't actually support using that portion of the dynamic range anyway, so you wouldn't be losing anything meaningful.  </p>

<p>The key is that you want to make strong use of the color space your camera can capture and encode that way you have the highest possible use of the color space as long as you are careful not to exceed the color space (color clipping needs to be avoided).  It is always easy to make colors more subdued and to lower contrast as this is moving from a high color resolution to a low one, but you can't move the other way because you don't have the detail to fill in.</p>

<p>What flat means is not necessarily low contrast or low saturation, but rather that the colors are not heavily tinted and that details are well represented within the usable portion of the color space.  They can be fairly vibrant, but they have a neutral response and gamma.  In other words, you want it to evenly capture detail across the DR, but you also want the DR to be fully utilized.  Think of flat as the way the curve looks in the Photoshop curves tool.  Flat would be a straight line rather than a curved one.  It can still have very strong contrast and saturation since the DR is being fully used.</p>

<p>For the third part, it really doesn't matter.  Either you mix to subdued colors and boost everything or you mix to vibrant colors and bring it down.  Either way, as long as it fits at some point, it will fit when you adjust the color grade of the entire frame if it fit well before.</p>

"How do I PROPERLY slow down a 60 fps clip in Vegas Pro 11?","2817","","<p>Let me start at the very beginning:</p>

<p>My project frame rate is 23.976 fps (standard film). When I create such a project in Adobe Premiere and then want to add a clip to the timeline, I can set the frame rate of the clip manually. Therefore, when my clip is 60 fps shot with a Canon DSLr (actually I believe and hope it's 59.94 fps), I can override its fps to 23.976 and then drop it to the timeline, thus getting the perfect slow-motion = as slow as possible without any frames missing in-between.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know how do I do this in Vegas Pro 11. All I can do is drop the clip to the time-line and then set its playback rate to 0.4x original speed (59.94 * 0.4 = 23.976). However, I don't know how safe this is. Is it safe to assume that the playback speed of the clip will be EXACTLY 23.976 fps and there won't be any frames missing in-between, thus creating the perfect slow-motion?</p>
","<p>You should be safe setting playback rate at 0.400. 59.94 is actually 60/1.001 and 23.976 is actually 24/1.001, so the 0.4 multiplier is technically exact. Switch off resample to be sure. Of course, how Vegas actually handles this internally is anybody's guess.</p>

<p>One way to test this would be to generate a frame sequence just containing an incremental numeral display (1,2,3...) in AE or similar, then render that as a 59.94p video. Import in vegas with playback 0.4 and resample off and then cycle through the frames to see if there are any duplicates or missing.</p>

<p>Is there any software or Action Script to achieve this without needing advanced knowledge?</p>

<p>Any end-to-end <strong>tutorial</strong> which can teach me how to make videos like this may also help me.</p>
","<p>After Effects is probably the easiest all inclusive solution that could handle everything they do in those videos, but they are doing multiple things and there isn't really a good way to give a tutorial for all of them.  </p>

<p>You would need to shoot the video on a green screen so that it can be extracted and layered in.  You can then animate the layer than those green screened clips and animate them with keyframe animation to make them move as needed on top of the white board.</p>

<p>The whiteboard itself can also be made using Write On effects or path animation.</p>

<p>Similar things can also be done with other decent NLEs like Premiere, Final Cut Pro, Vegas, Media Composer or Lightworks, but path animation and motion graphics (which this is a class of) are most easily done in After Effects.</p>

<p>What I didn't realize with ffmpeg at first was that the 'blackframe' or 'blackdetect' filters, is that they didn't actually filter.  They just seem to show you what you can possibly filter, with other command(s).  </p>

<p>What is the best way in 'Windows' to actually filter out the resulting found frames?</p>

<p>So with ffmpeg I'm actually concat-(ting) the forward and reverse of the same file than I'm running some filters on those files.  See my current command:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -y -i ""2013-10-14_14-30-55.mov"" -filter_complex ""[0:v]transpose=3,split[tp][tp2];[tp]reverse[vr];[tp2][vr]concat=n=2:v=1:a=0[vbf];[vbf]blackframe=98:32[v]"" -map ""[v]"" -vcodec wmv2 -q 10 -trellis 2 -r 16 ""g:\gd5.wmv""
</code></pre>

<p>Then I get this output: (Just the tail end of it anyway...)</p>

<p>So what do I do with this blackframe information in Windows?  Or is there a better method with the 'blackdetect' filter?</p>
","<p>Here's a way to do it with the <code>blackdetect</code> and <code>trim</code> filters.</p>

<p>First, a better way to get the <code>blackdetect</code> output is via <code>ffprobe</code> because it is capable of writing structured data such as <code>XML</code>, <code>JSON</code> or one <code>key=value</code> per line. </p>

<p>You do this using metadata injection:</p>

<p><code>ffprobe -f lavfi -i ""movie=/path/to/input.mp4,blackdetect[out0]"" -show_entries tags=lavfi.black_start,lavfi.black_end -of default=nw=1 -v quiet
TAG:lavfi.black_start=0
TAG:lavfi.black_end=5.42208
TAG:lavfi.black_start=73.4067
</code></p>

<p>As you can see it returns the start and end time of each black section. You use the returned info to <code>trim</code> the segments between each <code>end</code> and the next <code>start</code>:</p>

<p><code>ffmpeg -i /path/to/input.mp4 -filter_complex ""[0:v]trim=start=5.42208:end=73.4067,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v1];[0:a]atrim=start=5.42208:end=73.4067,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a1]"" -map [v1] -map [a1] output.mp4</code></p>

<p>You can chain multiple <code>trim</code> filters in the same command. See <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/681885/how-can-i-remove-multiple-segments-from-a-video-using-ffmpeg"">this answer</a> for a detailed example.</p>

<p>To automate this in Windows you can install and use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerShell</a> or another scripting language of your choice (PHP, Python etc).</p>

"Best bitrate to responsive (web) video","2677","","<p>So, I am a multimedia developer: I develop websites and that nerd things... My last site is responsive (fluid work in all devices - mobile, computer, television,...).</p>

<p>A responsive website needs <strong>4 video files</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>2 <code>MP4</code> - <strong>1)</strong> for big screens and <strong>1)</strong> for small screens</li>
<li>2 <code>WEBM</code> - for same purposes</li>
</ol>

<p>So, recently I checked my server disk usage and I realized that videos are consuming a big percentage of it, so I guess that it's because of bitrate.</p>

<h2>DEFAULT BITRATE OF MY VIDEOS</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>HD MP4</strong> - 2,10 Mbps - 1280X720 (~77,5MB) - <strong>Duration:</strong> 04:42</li>
<li><strong>SD MP4</strong> - 694 kbps - 640X360 (~25,57MB) - <strong>Duration:</strong> 04:42</li>
</ol>

<p>So, am I using right bitrate? Are the files small enough?</p>
","<p>Those are the expected file sizes for those data rates.  4 minutes and 42 seconds of video is 282 seconds of video, at 2.1 Mbps, that's 592.2 Mbits.  That's around 72 megabytes or so, so your 77.5 megabyte file is the correct size (there can be some variation and sound is also generally factored in separately.)</p>

<p>Those are also pretty close to the minimum bitrates that you can use without getting substantial quality loss.  2.1 Mbps is around the same bitrate that Hulu uses for their 720HD streaming and they are the lowest bandwidth of the major streaming sites that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>If you plan to host video, you really need more disk space and bandwidth.  Hosting is available very cheaply for multiple gigabytes of hosting space with unlimited bandwidth if you look around a bit, though I haven't been in that segment of the market for a while so I couldn't tell you who is best anymore.  (I self host on a dedicated server because I need a lot of space and high performance.)</p>

"FFMpeg and HLS, videos need to load in their entirety before they start playing","2673","","<p>I am using ffmpeg to generate a segmented list of files in order to stream them to an iOS app. The list of files is generated fine but when it comes time to play them, the video needs to be downloaded in its entirety before playback starts. This behaviour seems to be the case on iOS, Safari and VLC.</p>

<p>Does anybody know why this is happening and how I can improve the performance of playback? I have complete control over how the files are recorded in iOS, as well as how they are processed. Here is a sample stream:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bytesizecreations.com/storie-test/hls.m3u8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bytesizecreations.com/storie-test/hls.m3u8</a></p>

<p>Here are my ffmpeg commands to generate the segments from the file:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i joined.ts -flags -global_header -vcodec copy -acodec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_time 2 -segment_list hls.m3u8 -segment_list_size 999999 -segment_format mpegts out%03d.ts

","<p>So it turns out after a lot of research that this is the desired behaviour for Apple's AVPlayer component. Basically, my Internet is so slow here where I live, the component waits until the video has fully downloaded before it starts playing. The best and recommended way around this, is to generate alternate streams for the video before trying to play it. Here is documentation on the m3u8 format and HLS streaming guidelines:</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/networkinginternet/conceptual/streamingmediaguide/Introduction/Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/networkinginternet/conceptual/streamingmediaguide/Introduction/Introduction.html</a></p>

<p>I followed the above and generated two extra streams from the original: a 200kbps, 400kbps, and playback now starts almost immediately. Your mileage may vary depending on the speed of your Internet connection.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you don't have to use something like HLS, you can use plain mp4 files. Make sure that they have <code>-faststart</code> enabled if you are processing the file with ffmpeg.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To simplify this for other developers, I have released an SDK that is able to upload your mov or mp4 files to a cloud service and convert the file to an HLS compatible stream. The SDK can be installed via Cocoapods and you can access documentation and the framework here: </p>

"Convert Uncompressed AVI to JPEG2000 in MXF","2628","","<p>I'm looking to convert raw, uncompressed video (currently in avi container) into lossless motion jpeg2000 encoded video in an mxf container.

<code>Could not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec parameters ?)</code></p>
","<p>The JPEG 2000 codec in FFMPEG is still experimental. To use it you would have to compile FFMPEG by yourself with a special option enabled.</p>

<p>But you could use <a href=""http://opendcp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenDCP</a>, which has it's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/opendcp/wiki/Documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation here</a>.

<p>OpenDCP is available on all mayor platforms, but the easyDCP player only on Windows/Mac. But perhaps this is still an option for you, since you only need to run the easyDCP player once (on a friend's PC), just to be sure that the OpenDCP output is ""according to the standard"".</p>

"How to create simple animation with transparent background?","2618","","<p>I'd like to create basically a HUD (head up display) using simple animations.  The following are three different videos:</p>

<p>As an example, in some video, I can introduce the animated checkmark.  You'll see the checkmark next to something I want to emphasize but everything under the checkmark (in the host video) is still visible (because of transparency in the checkmark video).</p>

"Display Contents Outside of Composition Boundary?","2527","","<p>I have an icon I'm animating within it's own composition. I want the comp size to be comparable to the final size of the icon, so when I lay it down in other projects, I have a good understanding of where the icon will end up.</p>

<p>As the icon animates in, it extends beyond the size of its composition. Can I set the composition to render display elements outside of its boundary box?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Andy.</p>
","<p>Make the layers in the initial composition 3D layers. Then nest it in the other comp and make the layer it creates 3D, and turn on continuous rasterisation (the sun icon) for that layer. Now elements protruding beyond the edge of the nested comp will appear. </p>

<p>This will not create any problems if your comp is 2D, but it might create problems if you're using 3D layers in either the nested comp or the final one. The other problem is that the bounding box shown in the comp window is dynamic for a continuously rasterised layer, so it will grow to suit the size of all the visible layers.</p>

<p>A less kludgy way of achieving this result would be to make the nested comp big enough to fit all the action, and to add a layer to act as guide to show the size of the final frame. You could create a solid, or a shape layer with an outline or whatever you want. Unfortunately you could not use a proper guide layer, as they do not show up in nested compositions, only in the composition in which they reside. So you'd have to turn off the pseudo-guide layer before rendering.</p>

"Preventing flicker when recording live presentations","2524","","<p>Say someone's giving a presentation with the projector image next to them. What I see when recording this is the screen flickers, kind of like top-to-bottom scan refresh that's actually visible. What can be done to fix this? Recording is done with Canon 5DIII.</p>
","<p>The reason why this happen has to do with synchronization, or rather, lack there-of.</p>

<p>The projector displays its video-stream at one frame-rate and starting at one point, while your Canon records at a perhaps different frame-rate and starting when the projector image maybe has drawn part of the image.</p>

<p>The ideal approach is to use a common sync - in this case that is very unlikely to help in any case as the Canon don't have a sync input and the projector probably doesn't have one either.</p>

<p>To reduce the problem you need to make sure as a minimum that the Canon and the projector work on the same frame-rate. Ask someone or ask to look at the projector if possible. The start-point (for when the image lines start to draw) is worse - here you need to cross fingers and hope that when you turn on your camera that it will sync with the vertical blanking. As a rule of thumb: use 60i or 30p fps in America and Japan, 50i or 25p in Europe. However, some projectors can show at an internal rate rather than the one based on the electrical system.</p>

<p>Secondly, lower shutter-time (slower) and of course increase the f-stop (add ND filter if necessary). This will reduce the flicker but you can still get ""bands"" in the video. It will also be more sensitive to movement so here you need to balance/compromise. Too low and you get a strobo-effect instead.</p>

<p>Also try progressive record mode to see if that helps.</p>

<p>However, the best option in cases such as these is to ask for a copy of the presentation file so you can grab stills/video from that in post and super-impose those on the video, or cut to the presentation when editing.</p>

<p>Ask in advance so you can rig your camera in a better position to capture the presenter rather then the screen, but keep track of where in the presentation he is so you get the correct ""slide"" in post.</p>

Secondly how can I webcast this video?</p>
","<p>Your best bet for this is to use streaming software.  <a href=""http://obsproject.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Open Broadcaster Software</a> for example is able to take a video capture device input (such as using an HDMI capture device and an HDMI camera, or simply using a high end web cam) and combine it with a screen capture (built in feature) and turn it in to a video stream on the fly.  It can then relay this stream to a stream service of your choice, such as YouTube or you can use your own media server such as a RED 5 instance (though running your own server is far more complicated.)</p>

"What is the ffmpeg filter equivalent of ""Automatic levels"" for colors?","2487","","<p>Looking at the documentation about filters there seems to be a <a href=""http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#curves-1"" rel=""nofollow"">curve</a> filter to manipulate color with the following presets:</p>

<p>Unfortunately the documentation doesn't mention what these presets do or what their parameters are. I'm looking for a simple option to take a video and auto level colors for all the frames. Does any of these presets do that?</p>
","<p>Here's the details on what the presets do:</p>

<pre><code>[PRESET_COLOR_NEGATIVE] = {
    ""0/1 0.129/1 0.466/0.498 0.725/0 1/0"",
    ""0/1 0.109/1 0.301/0.498 0.517/0 1/0"",

    ""0.231/0.094 0.709/0.874"",
},
[PRESET_DARKER]             = { .master = ""0.5/0.4"" },
[PRESET_INCREASE_CONTRAST]  = { .master = ""0.149/0.066 0.831/0.905 0.905/0.98"" },
[PRESET_LIGHTER]            = { .master = ""0.4/0.5"" },
[PRESET_LINEAR_CONTRAST]    = { .master = ""0.305/0.286 0.694/0.713"" },

    ""0.50/0.48"",
    ""0/0.22 0.49/0.44 1/0.8"",
}
</code></pre>

<p>For each preset, each <code>x/y</code> pair maps input <code>x</code> to output <code>y</code>, where the range is <code>0-1</code>. If not set, the filter automatically sets <code>0/0</code> and <code>1/1</code> i.e. input black = output black and input white = output white. Whereas <code>0/1</code> would mean set input black pixels to white in output. Where you have multiple pairs in quotes, separated by commas, the sequence is <code>""R"",""G"",""B""</code> mapping. The interpolation between the points is <em>natural cubic spline</em>. </p>

<hr>

<p>For auto leveling, a crude method would be use the <code>autolevels</code> subfilter of the <code>pp</code> filter.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf pp=al output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is stretch luminance to full range.</p>

<hr>

<p>To check levels before (and after) any adjustment you do, you can generate a RGB parade for a frame like so</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf ""format=rgb24,waveform=c=7:d=parade,scale=1200x512"" -vframes 1 frame1parade.png

<p>For a specific frame, use</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -ss 12.4 -i input.mp4 -vf ""format=rgb24,waveform=c=7:d=parade,scale=1200x512"" -vframes 1 frameNparade.png

<p>Use:  These videos will be played in a web-based eduational app. They'll be up to about 5 seconds and be played in the latest Chrome or (on iOS/Mac) Safari browser.</p>

<p>I'm using Handbrake (.9.9.5530, latest) . These must be playable in <strong>Chrome and Safari</strong> (latest versions) browsers without any pluggins (and would be nice to be playable in the latest FireFox and IE).
(I'm also open to using another free or cheap encoding software that will let me do batch processing.</p>

<p>What are the recommended settings (Video Codec, Quality (and constant or avg bit rate, etc.)

<p>As for the exact formats I would suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>H.264 and AAC in MP4</strong>: Chrome, Firefox 22+ on Windows, IE9, Safari 3.1</li>
<li><strong>VP8 and Vorbis in WebM</strong>: Firefox fallback for Mac and older versions on Windows.</li>
<li>(If you need support for even older browsers (IE6-8), and mobile (Android, WP7), you could add <a href=""http://mediaelementjs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mediaelement.js</a> to your website.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure to put them in that order to make the fallback work. H.264 or MPEG-4 are recommended because they are the only formats to have hardware acceleration on newer devices. </p>

<p>Compression settings: start by using <strong>constant quality</strong> with default settings for video and <strong>128 Kbps VBR</strong> audio. For H.264 make sure to not exceed <strong>Main Profile</strong> and <strong>Level 4.0</strong>.

<p>I'm using Final Cut Pro 7 and I know how to insert text. What I need to know is what font is typically used for subtitles and what size should this font be?</p>

<p>Subsequently, if two people are talking simultaneously, what is the best way to alter the subtitle so the viewer is aware which subtitle belongs to which character?</p>
","<p>Subtitling is a horrible horrible thing, and there are loads of regulations and standards and other bull which can be found <a href=""http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/standards_for_subtitling/subtitling_1.asp.html"">here.</a> </p>

<p>As for the font, it really depends on your opinion - if I'm not mistaken Trebuchet Sans and Deja Vu Sans are as close as you can get to the standard DVD fonts. </p>

<p>But all I just said depend on your artistic point of view - if the subtitles makes part of the movie it shouldn't follow the general guidelines - I would strongly recommend using a font that makes sense with the movie (Example: Consolas would be great for a movie like Primer or Tron) and use free style subtitles - like the ones in classic adventure games. </p>

<p>If you're not aware about these games, check out Full Throttle Opening on youtube.</p>

<p>Then again, here's some ideas about people talking simultaneously:</p>

<p>If they are from opposite sexes you can use different colors for each character. 
One character's lines could be on the right side of the screen while the other is on the left. 
You can even use different fonts (not recommended) </p>

<p>But, according to the usual pattern you should identify the characters who are speaking with brackets and simply show both lines at the same time. </p>

<pre><code>[John Doe] I love you Mary. 
[Mary Doe] GTFO, I hate you.

"How to re-edit and/or duplicate an in-progress edit with YouTube Video Editor","2395","","<p>After uploading a bunch of clips to YouTube, I go into their editor and begin making cuts, combining clips together, etc. The problem is, after I published it, there is no way (that I can see) to go back and open up that project in the Video Editor again to make changes to the edit.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be so bad if I also couldn't figure out how to duplicate an edit project. So for example, if Im in the middle of editing a bunch of clips together, named ""Project 1"", how could I think ""Save as..."" or duplicate that project to ""Project 1b.""</p>

<p>Any ideas? The google help center on this is pretty sparse.</p>
","<p>The YouTube video editor is just not designed for this sort of thing - it has very basic functionality, just enough to allow you to tweak a couple of things. Once the edit is complete it has no ongoing concept of a 'project' - you just have a new video.</p>

","<p>I have no idea if what you're doing is optimal, but ""playing the video"" to extract frames is essentially what has to happen, at least a little, if the frame you're extracting is not an I-frame (most frames are not). </p>

<p>The chosen frame is likely represented as the accumulated differences since the last complete frame, which is what interframe compression does. In order to extract it, a program must read and reconstruct the intervening frames -- not from the beginning of the video, just from the most recent complete frame</p>

<p>Depending on how many frames you need from each video, it might make sense to first convert to an ""all-I"" codec like MJPEG, where every frame stands alone. Then extracting any given frame would be much faster. When done you can delete the converted file.</p>

<li><p>The transpose value can be ""1"" or ""clock"" for clockwise rotation, ""2"" or ""cclock"" for counter-clockwise rotation. There are other values which will also apply a flip.</p></li>

wildcard patterns (globbing) internally, by selecting the image2-specific
-pattern_type glob option.

<p>In this specific command, <code>-r</code> is for framerate, and <code>-s</code> is our image size. <code>-vcodec qtrle</code> tells ffmpeg to use QuickTime Animation. For ProRes, you can use:</p>

if (thisComp.layer(1).text.sourceText.substr(theOffset, 1) == "" "" ){0} else {100}

try {
    transform.position.key(theOffset + 1).value
}
catch(error){[-10000,0]}//effectively hide it on errors (like the index going out of bounds)

<pre><code>xOffset = thisComp.layer(1).text.sourceText.substr(1, theOffset).getTextWidth()

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My specific use case: we're about to have a number of software demos for various products and would like to record these.  We can then make these videos available to the end users so they can see what was said &amp; get an idea of what the products looked like without them needing to sit through each demo (saving them time, easing the logistics of organising the demos and keeping number of people present down to avoid too many tangents).  We're likely to also use this tool for some user training videos once the eventual products are selected.</p>

<p><strong>Research</strong></p>

<p>So far I've found a number of potential solutions, but have no personal experience with any.  Reading their sites though they claim to record from various input sources it's not clear if simultaneous input (i.e. cam &amp; screen) recording is possible, or if there are limits on video length.</p>

<p>You will probably find Camtasia a bit stiff when it comes to the price compared to your budget, but I mentioned SnagIt for this reason although it's primarily to capture screenshots it do have built-in video recording as well using the same codec as its big brother.</p>

<p>It's simpler and you will probably want to convert the result and edit it in a third-party editor (Camtasia Studio comes with its own editor which is in part why the price is higher).</p>

<p>I never recorded 3 hours but I did more than an hour which was without problem. The key factor here is to have enough space on the disk you record to.</p>

"Record video without Live View / Turning off Monitor while Recording","2263","","<p>I am a brand new amateur photographer, so I really needing a lot of input from other users, for example..</p>

<p>I just notice yesterday while recording some video with my Nikon D5200 that I can't record video using only the eyecup view !</p>

<p>Only when I was using the live view mode, I could press the record button and record video, why is this happening?</p>

<p>My problem is that, the monitor is one of the camera functions that drain most of my battery!!! I record three videos of 20 minutes and I it's dead, because the screen is always on.</p>

<p>So, actually I have two questions:</p>

<p>1) Can I record video using only the eyecup mode (without live-view)?</p>

<p>2) If it's not possible, then, can I use live view mode but just turn off the LCD monitor?</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your help!
Looking forward for your answer, I am loving learning photography, still need a lot of information :)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I can't record video using only the eyecup view</p>
</blockquote>

<p>D5200 is an SLR, that is a <em>single-lens reflex camera</em>.</p>

<p>As opposed to mirrorless cameras, SLRs use a mirror which sends the image which passes through the lens to the top where, with the help of a pentaprism, the light is redirected to the viewfinder.</p>

<p>When you shot a photo, the mirror is raised, letting the light through. Behind this mirror is situated the film, or, in digital SLRs, the sensor.</p>

<p>Depending on the position of the mirror, the light arrives to either the sensor, or the viewfinder. Never both. You can, by the way, see it very easily: shot a photo at 1/2 of a second while looking through the viewfinder: you'll see that it becomes dark for half a second.</p>

<p>When you're recording a video, the mirror is raised during the entire recording: the light which passes through the lens hits directly the sensor. The same thing happens with Live View—the only difference with video recording is just that the signal received by the sensor is not recorded to the memory card.</p>

<p>Could you disable the LCD screen when shooting a video? I don't remember seeing anything like that in the options, and it wouldn't be particularly useful, since it's kinda useful to be able to watch what you're shooting. However, if you're using a remote controller (such as a tablet or a PC), then the LCD screen on the camera is turned off.</p>

<p><strong>Why wouldn't the mirror move up and down constantly when shooting the video, letting you look through the viewfinder?</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons for that, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The image will look darker, since a part of the light will need to reach the sensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Flipping the mirror up and down twenty-five to sixty times per second would make a lot of noise, and lead to camera shake.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking through the viewfinder when shooting a video isn't very practical.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last point, specifically, leads me to another aspect. I imagine that your original question is motivated by the fact that it's difficult to view anything on the LCD screen in a bright day. For that, different accessories exist. Most popular ones are <a href=""https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/682687-REG/Zacuto_Z_FIND_PRO2_Z_Finder_Pro_2_5x.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the viewfinder which fixes itself directly on the LCD screen</a> like that:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVGDQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVGDQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>as well as the external monitors which look like that:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKNyQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKNyQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>There is a much less expensive alternative: use a tablet as an external monitor. However, the quality of a professional external monitor is much higher than a tablet, especially noticeable when you have to work outside on a sunny day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My problem is that, the monitor is one of the camera functions that drain most of my battery!!! I record three videos of 20 minutes and I it's dead, because the screen is always on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it's not. While the LCD screen consumes some power, what actually drains the battery is the recording itself, i.e. the processing of the light received by the sensor into a video file on your memory card.</p>

<p>Note that there are accessories for that too. <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/power-adapters/eh-5b-ac-adapter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Power adapters</a> make it possible to use the camera without battery, so if you're shooting videos in a studio, this could be an option.</p>

<p>For some DSLRs, Nikon also sells battery grips which are connected to the bottom of the camera. It looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDEqv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDEqv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, it seems that Nikon doesn't have grips for D5200. There are third-party ones, but be careful when purchasing them, since low quality ones can damage your camera. High quality ones are usually rather expensive ($200 to $600).</p>

<p>Another solution consists of buying spare batteries. When one is depleted, you use another one, while recharging the first. Having three or four batteries is not that unusual.</p>

","<p>I researched this when building my own computer for HD video editing about a year ago - I don't remember all of my sources, but there's <a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/thread/433549"" rel=""nofollow"">a hardware guide</a> on the Adobe Primiere Hardware Forum (very helpful place) that was a big help. That guide is several years old, so the specific hardware recommended is out of date, but the principles are still there.</p>

<p>Basically, most gaming PCs are going to have a more powerful graphics card than you need and less RAM than you'll want (and possibly inadequate hard drives). It's better to build yourself, but if you're going to buy an off-the-shelf model, a gaming PC will probably serve you better than one that's not (since most of the manufacturers' high-end stuff is geared toward gamers). There are companies that build PCs specifically for video editing, but they are VERY expensive, especially compared to what you can do yourself. I built mine for around $1000, which is what I would've paid for the Dells and HPs I was looking at, but I was able to get exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>I don't know about audio, but for video, I'd recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fastest processor that fits your budget (use <a href=""http://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">benchmark scores</a>, not clock speeds, to compare)</li>
<li>Fast hard drives. An ideal setup from what I've read (and based on <a href=""http://ppbm5.com/DB-PPBM5-2.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Premiere benchmarks</a>) is to have a small SSD for your boot drive and a RAID array for the actual editing. Those are fairly expensive, but at minimum, you should have 2 hard drives, one to boot and one to work in (and do NOT get 5400 RPM models).</li>
<li>A mid-level graphics card. I've got a GeForce GTX 550 Ti and it handles my 1080p/60fps video just fine.</li>
<li>RAM will depend on what software you're using (as will all of these, but RAM more so). For Premiere CS5+, for instance, you probably want at least 12 GB; I use Lightworks, which is still a 32 bit program as of this writing and therefore can't use more than 4 GB.</li>

","<p>Simply put, to make a full length movie requires a lot of man hours and generally a decent budget.  It becomes more cost effective to get real animation software when dealing with a full length film than trying to struggle through with something like Blender.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, Blender is great for what it is as a free product, but, at least as of the last time I was able to seriously work with it a few years back, it was nothing at all compared to the capabilities of one of the high end systems like Maya or SoftImage.</p>

<p>Both the ease of working with the tools and the improved collaboration workflows make it so that using a commercial system may likely be cheaper in the long run due to time saved for a long project like a full length movie.  It's certainly easier, even if costs are just close to comparable.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Maya isn't the only platform used by the big studios.  Several use their own in-house systems, Maya, SoftImage and Cinema4D are also all used pretty extensively.  3D Studio Max is also sometimes used, though it has found more of a niche in the video game market.</p>

<p>I am using After effects and I have imported the image sequence, made a composition (30fps, 2 min long) changed the time remapping so each drawing is displayed during 15 frames (0.5 seconds). </p>

<p>My issue is that the change between drawings snaps and I need a crossfade between them. The other option I can think of to is create a composition with all the drawings and manualy create key images for opacity but this is going to be very long as it has to go on for 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Is there a way to crossfade each drawing into the next one in Affter effects?</p>
","<p>There's always more than one way to do things in AE:</p>

<p><strong>Method1</strong></p>

<p>Import the drawings as separate source files, rather than as an image sequence (in the import dialog uncheck the image sequence checkbox). Once you've got all your images imported select them all and drag them into a new composition. </p>

<p>They will appear as a stack of layers with only the top layer visible, but don't fret. Next step is to trim them to the length you need. The easiest way to do this is to select them all and move the playhead to the last frame you want (frame 15 in your case) and hit <kbd>alt/option</kbd><kbd>]</kbd> which is the shortcut for trimming the end of a layer.</p>

<p>Now right click one of the selected layers and from the contextual menu choose <strong>Keyframe Assistant > Sequence Layers…</strong>. To get a crossfade you need to check the overlap box, and use the <strong>Dissolve Front Layer</strong> transition (I have never been able to work out why you would <em>ever</em> use the <strong>Dissolve front and back layers</strong> option, because it means that halfway through both layers will be 50% transparent, meaning that the background will show through). You might have to go back and add extra frames to your layers to allow for the overlap, so if you want a 5 frame overlap on a 15 frame layer you'll need to make it 20 frames.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XivGC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is the built-in tool for doing exactly what you want to do.</p>

<p>Do what you're doing, but make sure that frame blending is turned on for your image sequences. It's the little filmstrip icon in the switches column (you may have to hit <kbd>f4</kbd> to toggle the visibility. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l6xLd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There are two values for frame blending, you want the first one, which is basically dissolving between frames — the second one does a kind of morph between successive frames which can do a good job in some circumstances, but can look very weird in others.</p>

<p>Now because frame blending is a bit computationally expensive, AE doesn't show it in the comp window by default. You'll have to turn it on to see it, and you do that by hitting the filmstrip button at the top of the layers area in your timeline:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fHwDu.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Click it and it will go blue, and you'll see your frames blending.</p>

<p>Although this might be easier to set up, it does have the disadvantage that the frames are going to be constantly dissolving, with only one frame each where they are 100% from the individual drawing.</p>

<p>To force it to update only once a second you need to use the <a href=""http://adobe.ly/1DZW3md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>seedRandom</code></a> function, with the <code>timeless</code> attribute set to <code>true</code>, and a <code>seed</code> that changes every second. Using <code>Math.floor(time)</code> will return a value that increases once every second, on the second.</p>

<p>So something like:</p>

<pre><code>seedRandom(Math.floor(time), timeless = true);
random(45,55);

<pre><code>var holdTime = 5;
seedRandom(Math.floor(time/holdTime), timeless = true);
random(45,55);

<p>will stay constant for 5 seconds - you can change the value of the variable <code>holdTime</code> to control how long the value holds for. For example to change once every frame, but not during sub-frame intervals set it to <code>holdTime = thisComp.frameDuration;</code></p>

I had expected to be able to bring this info back into Premiere Pro using an EDL (Edit Decision List) but none of the ""cuts"" that SpeedGrade marked seem to be reflected when I try this. Either I'm doing something wrong or Premiere/SpeedGrade can't support this sort of workflow.</p>

<p>Also to keep in mind, this is expected to be a repetitive process, and I'm developing this workflow for people who may be inexperienced in video editing, so it really should be automated as much as possible. Manually entering the start and end times of each shot isn't really a viable option because it would be ridiculously time consuming, even after SpeedGrade determines these times. </p>

","<p>The short answer is anything that works for you. IMO, the 550D is a fine choice if it works for you.</p>

<p>The long answer? Even if you need to postpone the film, make sure your script is FLAWLESS. Shooting with a <a href=""http://www.red.com/"">Red</a> can't save an awful script, but I've seen some ~awesome~ shorts &amp; features shot with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PXL-2000"">Fisher Price PXL-2000</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Digital-Camera-Photo/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=373705011"">Flip</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond that, understand lighting. Know where your light is coming from and how to use it to make your scenes less muddy or grainy (unless that's what you're going for stylistically). Consumer camcorders are less light-sensitive than their professional brethern. </p>

<p>Also, make sure you can record decent sound. In most cases, on-board microphones are crap. That being said, bad sound makes a mediocre script awful. amazing sound can make mediocre scripts a touch less painful to watch. </p>

<p>One other thing you may want to try: network with other filmmakers and see what they're using. See if you can rent or borrow cameras to see what you like to work with. Who knows?

"Why more than 10 FPS is needed","2111","","<p>As we know that out brain can process at most 1/10th of a second then why we go beyond the 10 FPS as our brain should not be able to process more than the 10 FPS of a scene. whats is the logic behind ?</p>
","<p>The brain can process an image displayed for as little as 13 ms if the surrounding content is blank.  10 to 12 images per second is only the number of images that appear distinct to the eye.  Beyond 10 to 12 images a second,  the brain starts to try to piece them together, but it is doing a lot of work to make that go and the motion isn't as smooth as it could be.</p>

<p>Using higher frame rates means that the brain has to do less filling in the gaps and motion can appear more accurate and smoother since the brain is actually fully capable of processing images faster than 10 times a second.</p>

<p>The 12fps animation threshold is only a minimum to get the appearance of motion, not the maximum amount of information our brain can take in.  We can process far more images per second to determine motion, but require at least 10 to 12.</p>

<p>You can test this for yourself if you want by taking a 30 fps video and inserting a black frame at random in the video.  You'll easily notice the distortion from the missed frame because it abruptly changes to something other than the expected image.</p>

<p>Basically your brain knows what it expects to see and can recognize that it didn't see what it expected, it just can't recall exactly what it is that it saw that it didn't expect since it was taking a shortcut to reduce the amount of processing needed.</p>

I also have an external drive where I store footage, am not sure if that should come into the mix.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>The question is whether disk performance is critical in your normal workflow, in which case you'd want to place the footage on the SSD.</p>

<p>I have a similiar setup with Sony Vegas and I observed that, disk performance is rather uncritical during rendering, because it's always the processor that's the bottle neck. But your situation may differ from that. Especially, if you have a very fast CPU and a very slow HDD.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong></p>

<p>The following configuration works well for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>OS on SSD to have fast boot time</li>
<li>Vegas/Premiere on SSD to have fast startup time</li>
<li>Video footage on HDD to have all footage in a single location.</li>
<li>External drive for backuping your footage</li>
<li>All other stuff: where-ever there is room left. Just make sure there is enough storage for your videos on HDD. 750GB fill up very quickly with HD footage ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Disadvantage</em>: May be slow with fast CPU's and slow drives. Project opening times may be slow as well.</p>

<p><em>Advantage</em>: Fast boot and programm start. All footage in one place.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> </p>

<p>Of course, if OS+Premiere+Video fits to the SSD, put it there. This will give you the fastest experience. Plus the option to have a very fast backup to the HDD and a second slower backup to the external drive.</p>

<p><em>Advantage</em>: Fast. Double backup.</p>

<p><em>Disadvantage</em>: Not much storage for footage.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 3</strong>: </p>

<p>Put OS+Premiere to SSD and video to HDD. Place the one project that you're currently working on to SSD. This configuration is also very fast, but I sometimes experience issues with moving projects across the drives, so I try to avoid that. </p>

<p><em>Advantage</em>: Fast.</p>

"Remove noise in video post production","2097","","<p>I have a video, shot with a recent but low-end camcorder (Samsung HMX-Q10) in Full HD 1920x1080/50i.</p>

<p>The problem is that there wasn't enough light (I guess) and the camcorder added some ""parasites"" to the video on the zones in the shadow (blacks are quite okay, but dark zones are not).<br>
The kind of parasites that you may see on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ3fPl6eNkM"" rel=""nofollow"">that video</a> (on walls for instance) (this is not a video shot with that camcorder, nor my video).</p>

<p>So, I don't seem to be able to remove them when shooting, whatever the parameters of the cam are. I still need to try with more light, but I'd like to know if it is possible to correct that with a post-production effect on my existing video, especially with Sony Vegas Pro.</p>

<p>Moreover, is there a way to prevent the cam to add those artificial elements to the video ? This looks like some numeric elements added to the video, like the cam tries to correct the lighting. Can't the camcorder write exactly the image it gets from the lens, even if it's too dark ?<br>
Can I achieve <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz6k-38jtUQ"" rel=""nofollow"">this kind of dark image</a> with my cam (or maybe it is darkened in post production ?)</p>
","<p>The parasites you talked about is called noise. The setting you can change to get less is called the ISO. It corresponds to the old ASA value we had before the digital age.</p>

<p>We can't see a thing, we can only see light. That's the way the universe is built up. Same with the camera. It sees the light reflected off surfaces. So white objects reflects all light and dark objects no light. And absence of light, as you know, means darkness. Where it is dark it has to ""work extra hard"" to figure out what's actually there, because there is almost no information there given from the light. Therefore you will get some noise. A better camera will produce less noise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Turn down the ISO as much as possible without compromising the aperture or ""shutter speed"" you want.</li>
  <li>Remove the noise left in post.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also no problem to edit it away in post on your computer! The only compromise is that you will get smoother edges and blurred images the more noise you remove. I once saw a movie shot entirely by moonlight. It was full of noise but they removed everything in post!</p>

<p>There are two plugins you can use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Neat Video's Noise Removal. I've never tried this, but you can use it with Sony Vegas. They claim to be the best in noise removal.</p></li>
  <li><p>Red Giant's Magic Bullet DeNoiser. I've used this and am very satisfied with it. Does a really good job. I don't know if this works in Vegas, but it certainly works great in Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro!</p></li>

If you disable it the imported comp will act like a rendered video.</p>

<p>If you have huge pixelation going on just go to full resolution in the preview and it will be fine, though the layer will not act like a vector, you will have a rasterized image so keep in mind to have a big enough resolution if you want to scale it up.

I know codecs come and go, but I'd like to understand the reasons why Adobe eliminated these options.  I know they're still available in Media Encoder CC, but why not After Effects CC?</p>
","<p>While I'm not aware of any release of the official reasons for this, I can offer a strong theory based on my knowledge of the way workflows are intended with After Effects.  After Effects is an effects and composition package, it is not designed to be placed at the end of a processing pipeline, but rather in the middle of it.  </p>

<p>After Effects is designed to work on clips that will be edited in to a finished product.  As such, it doesn't make a lot of sense to export from After Effects in a format that is targeted at end viewers, such as h.264 or WMV.  It makes much more sense to target high quality, low compression intermediate formats that will minimize iterative quality loss or simply to use embedded compositions directly in Premiere.</p>

<p>Since it isn't a designed use case to be doing final output from After Effects, it doesn't make a lot of sense to put in extra development time maintaining a feature that is redundant and not part of the main intended work flow of the product.  If you want to do a final output in that format, you can still use Media Encoder to do it and then they only have to license and maintain the encoders for one application rather than two.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate in the cases where you wanted to do a one off render of a clip, but that isn't their main use case that they are designing around.  They probably decided that maintaining that use case simply wasn't worth the cost of maintaining.</p>

<p>■ In photography, <strong>every change I make to photos is stored forever in Lightroom catalog</strong>, making it possible to revert to previous state at any moment. With virtual copies feature, Lightroom also enables to do what is called a <em>branch</em> in version control: the ability to test something different, and either keep both results or remove one of them later.</p>

<p>The catalog doesn't store the RAW photos themselves, but they don't change anyway.</p>

<p>■ In video production, things seem different. I work with Premiere Pro, After Effects and Soundbooth.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>None seem to store history permanently: if I do an action by mistake and notice it only the next day, there is no way to recover the previous version.</p></li>
<li><p>Soundbooth also changes directly the WAV files, which requires an additional effort to keep separate the original recordings from the modified ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Version control is rarely mentioned, and I haven't found anyone telling how does he actually use version control in his workflow. Moreover, nobody mentions which version control should be used, and since most version control systems are optimized for text files, not binary ones, this creates an additional challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>Video.SE doesn't have <a href=""/questions/tagged/version-control"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;version-control&#39;"" rel=""tag"">version-control</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/revisions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;revisions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">revisions</a> tags.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does version control have a part in the workflow of a person who works with video production? How is it integrated?</p></li>
<li><p>Would migrating to Adobe Creative Cloud help? Are there specific features which allow, in Creative Cloud, to track successive revisions of a Premiere Pro or After Effects project?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Remark: to avoid off-topic answers, I highlight that <strong>my question is unrelated to the backups</strong>, and is specifically about storing successive revisions of my work, not having an on-site/off-site backup of the data.</p>
","<p>Version control in the sense of Git isn't very practical in the video world. You would need to make a specific version control tool for every audio and video tool out there as all work with their own project formats.
But being able to read these formats is just one thing, then you also need the render engine of that tool to show diff's.</p>

<p>Though all of these tools work in a non-destructive way unless you pre-render some stuff (compare that to compiling a dll/lib of a piece of your code and work with that from now on), so you ususally can just go back to an old revision by doing ctrl+z or using the history tool in some programs.</p>

<p>Though saving sub versions is usually the way to go. Like stib described in his answer or by doing it manually.</p>

<p>Something I like to do and works well with every software is putting my project files (no source footage) into Dropbox. If you have a somewhat fast upload speed (~1 Mbit/s) and your project file isn't 100MB+, you can upload your project before you save the next time. An average Premiere/AE/FCP project is around 10-20MB so your recently saved files will be uploaded in 1-2 minutes. Even faster if you have more upload bandwidth.</p>

<p>Then if you have to go back you can access Dropbox's history of your files and download or restore to that revision. Dropbox saves file revisions forever* on a paid account (*atleast when they had the pack rat option, now its a year I think) and for 30 days on a free account. I'm sure that there are other cloud hosters that offer similar features.
It's a bit like using a super limited version of git that handles binary files very well and is headache free.
This has the advantage that you don't clutter the folder with tons of files and have a backup at the same time.</p>

<p>Most cloud hosters also offer Team Memberships so you can work with multiple editors. Or you share the project folder with other team members.</p>

"flattening a sequence in Adobe Premiere (collapsing included sequences)","2023","","<p>I'm using Adobe Premiere -- I'm trying to convert a project to use a single sequence, with all the media clips in that sequence.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm in Adobe Premiere 5.5, but I have Adobe CC available.</p>

<p>Any leads are welcome!</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>Q: What is the fastest and easiest way to replace these subsequences in my main sequence, with their component clips, such that the main sequence still renders to exactly the same video?</strong></p>

<p>If you have any leads or even partial ideas, please feel free to leave a comment.  Also, please mention which version of Premiere you are using.</p>

<h2>Current State of the Project</h2>

<p>This is a simplified view, the actual number of clips and subsequences is much larger!</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Sequence A

<ul>
<li>Clip 1</li>
<li>Clip 2</li>
<li>Sequence B</li>
<li>Clip 3</li>
<li>Sequence C</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sequence B

<ul>
<li>Clip 4</li>
<li>Clip 5</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sequence C

<ul>
<li>Clip 6</li>
<li>Clip 7</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Desired State of the Project</h2>

<ul>
<li>Main Sequence A

<ul>
<li>Clip 1</li>
<li>Clip 2</li>
<li>Clip 4</li>
<li>Clip 5</li>
<li>Clip 3</li>
<li>Clip 6</li>
<li>Clip 7</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Difficulties In Flattening</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sequence A doesn't use all of Sequence B, and it doesn't start at the beginning</li>
<li>Suppose I just copy the clips from Sequence B</li>
<li>...pasting them in Sequence A where Sequence B is now</li>
<li>the clips will not start at the same time they do when in Sequence A</li>
</ul>

<h1>Flattening Techniques</h1>

<h2>Attempt 1: Nesting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Select the clips in Sequence A, including Sequences B and C </li>
<li>choose ""Nest""</li>
<li>now only one sequence is in Sequence A!</li>
<li>...however that sequence still has nested sequences.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attempt 2: Trim project</h2>

<ul>
<li>I selected only Sequence A and chose Project Manager...</li>
<li>Premiere made an entirely new, simplified (""trimmed"") project</li>
<li>the media used in that Sequence A, and therefore B and C as well, were included in the sequence, and no others</li>
<li>the media used were copied to the new location (so they are in two places on this drive now)</li>
<li>...but when I opened the new project, Sequence A STILL has nested sequences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attempt 3: brute force</h2>

<p>Why bother?  Why not fix all these manually?  Well... </p>

<p>Here's the process I have at the moment to replace a single sub-sequence.  Bear in mind this is a large project and I'll have to do this dozens of times.</p>

<ul>
<li>in Sequence A, select Sequence B and duplicate to another layer</li>
<li>...we'll call this ""Sequence B2""</li>
<li>extend Sequence B2 in length to the very beginning of its earliest point </li>
<li>cut B2 to where Sequence B begins</li>
<li>the new first half of B2 is the length of B that elapses before showing the part used in Sequence A.  

<ul>
<li>This half we'll call B2a</li>
<li>the part that plays in Sequence A we'll call B2b</li>
</ul></li>
<li>now, in Sequence B, use timecode/frame arithmetic to go to the exact point in the clip</li>
<li>make the cut in the same place in Sequence B as it began in Sequence A... we'll call this B3, which is theoretically starts at the same point as B2b</li>
<li>copy the cut clip B3 in Sequence B...</li>
<li>...and paste in Sequence A on top of B2b and use a separate layer </li>
<li>set B3 to a partial opacity to verify Sequence A is EXACTLY THE SAME as it appeared before B3 was pasted in!

<ul>
<li>if it's off, you'll see B3 and B2b as two distinct and overlapping images</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
","<p>(1.) Open the master sequence containing the nested sequences.</p>

<p>(2.) MAKE SURE that the ""Insert or overwrite sequences as nests or individual clips"" selector (the leftmost icon under the timecode display in the sequence panel) is NOT highlighted. This will force a nested sequence in the Source Monitor to be edited into the sequence as the individual clips contained in the nested sequence.</p>

<p>(3.) Park the playhead in the middle of one of the nested items in the main sequence</p>

<p>(4.) Choose ""Marker / MARK CLIP"" (I have this programmed to ""X"" on the keyboard."") You need to make sure your track selection toggles are correctly set to target the track containing the nested item.</p>

<p>(5.) Choose ""Sequence / MATCH FRAME"" (I have this programmed to ""F"" on the keyboard.) This opens the nested sequence into the Source Monitor.</p>

<p>(6.) Choose ""Clip / OVERWRITE"" (I have this programmed to ""B"" on the keyboard, like an Avid.) This should have replaced the nested sequence CLIP ITEM with the clips contained in the nested sequence. This overwrites (from IN to OUT as selected in step 4) with the contents of the nested sequence.</p>

<p>(7.) move the playhead to the next clip and press X, F, B</p>

<p>(8.) repeat step 7 until you're done.</p>

<p>[This is tested on Premiere CC 2015.2]</p>

","<p>The simple answer is yes for a couple of reasons:</p>

"Is there a 4K action camera solution that does NOT have perspective distortion?","1987","","<p>I was looking at alternatives to the GoPro (such as the Sony FDR-X1000V), but they all seem to only shoot wide-angle with significant perspective distortion (fisheye). Are there action cameras which do <em>not</em> introduce this sort of distortion?</p>
","<p>There are two major advantages to recording fisheye distortion rather than rectilinear distortion.  First, it is optically easier to do, which means one can make lenses that are better in other metrics (such as chromatic aberration, resolution, vignetting, etc) while remaining small enough and light enough to fit into the body of an action camera.  Second, the relative size of an object doesn't change radically as its moves from center to edge when the camera is not under tight control.  For that reason, it is possible to define a crop area that follows the subject as it bounces around the full frame and then use motion tracking to create a relatively stable view of the object, which can then be de-fished.  If it were rectilinear, the stabilization process might have to do some major zoom and tilt corrections as well, which would be very distracting.</p>

"Audio from PA system to Camcorder","1985","","<p>I've been asked to video tape a Q/A session with a speaker, and I plan to use my HD camcorder (http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-HDC-TM700K-Camcorder-Control-Internal/dp/B0035LD0EY).</p>

<p>The issue is that my camcorder only has the 1/8th inch speaker cable input, and a long cable from the PA system to my camcorder could pick up a lot of noise.  Wondering what my options are as to how to get the audio from the PA system into my camcorder.  I thought of two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wirelessly transmit the audio from the PA system into the camcorder </li>
<li>Get an XLR &lt;--> 1/8th inch adapter for my camcorder and use an XLR cable to get the audio from the PA system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there any other ways?  If not, could you please recommend product options for 1 and 2. Not too expensive (around $100 if possible).  This isn't professional, but I do want decent audio quality.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>An XLR cable used with an adapter won't give you the audio quality that an all-XLR cable will. If audio quality is really important, I'd buy or borrow an external recorder that takes XLR cables directly. If this isn't an option, pick up an XLR to 1/8"" adapter cable. I suggest taping the adapter to the camcorder so it doesn't move around much. </p>

<p>(Mic cables <em>do</em> move around, particularly if you have a boom operator. However, with an interview, you may be able to use on-screen mics in stands or a single, overhead mic on a stand or hung from the ceiling.) </p>

<p>If you need two mics for the interview, you'll need a small mixer which you can then feed into the camera. </p>

<p>Wireless only really makes sense if you want to use lavalier mics on the actors; wireless systems introduce additional complexities, as they're less plug-and-play than a standard cabled mic. </p>

<p><strong>Balanced versus unbalanced audio:</strong></p>

<p>Any signal chain will have line noise. An unbalanced system (like an XLR cable going into an 1/8"" stereo adapter would be) will have more of it. XLR cables (with three connectors) are good because they deliver <em>balanced audio</em>, which is another way of saying that they can do long cable runs without much noise. </p>

<p>A 1/8"" cable has also three connectors, but usually because they carry a <em>stereo signal</em>, which is not the same as an unbalanced one. I assume the stereo cable jack on your camera means that the cable run is <em>not</em> balanced - repurposing that third prong from ground to a stereo signal is what does it. </p>

<p>Although I think it's technically possible to have a balanced 1/8"" jack, I've never heard of one. (A stereo signal carried through XLR would neccesitate two XLR cables.)  </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/HDC-TM700K?t=specs&amp;support#tabs"" rel=""nofollow"">Panasonic's specs</a>, your camera uses a ""stereo mini"" jack, not a balanced or TRS jack. Connector quality would be even more important in that case, since you're feeding an unbalanced analog signal to the camera. </p>

<p>If you have a little time, perhaps getting two adapters - one high-end and one inexpensive - and doing a test may be in order. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>In your situation, if buying or renting an external recorder isn't an option (around $300US), a good microphone feeding into an XLR to 1/8"" adapter <em>will</em> introduce line noise, but will also give you getter audio quality than most onboard camera mics.</p>

","<p>It's because of Spatial Interpolation.
You need the spatial interpolation to be set to linear, and by default it is set to Auto Bezier.</p>

<p>Right click on the keyframe at 3'00, and select <a href=""http://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/keyframe-interpolation.html"">Keyframe Interpolation</a>.  Change the Spatial Interpolation to linear, and it should solve the problem.</p>

<p>What's happening:</p>

<p>Instead of drawing straight lines (linear lines) between your positions on the screen, after effects is drawing curves (bezier curves).  When you tell your object to ""double back"" on itself, AE tries to draw a curve to this effect, causing a little knot or bounce forward at the 3'00 mark.  </p>

<p>You can choose how AE interprets changes in space, as described, but you can also choose how it interpolates time too (Temporal interpolation).  Setting temporal interpolation to bezier often produces nicer results than linear, as it allows objects to slowly come to a stop, rather than suddenly stopping at a keyframe, which is how objects in the real world respond (due to weight, friction, gravity etc).</p>

"ALL-I vs IPB. Which one to use","1973","","<p>I'm fairly new do filmmaking. I've been trying to figure out which is best, but people seem to have very different opinions and everyone has his own arguments. My guess is that ALL-I should be better because they are all I-Frames, whereas IPB should be used when storage is a concern. However, some people are saying IPB is actually better.  </p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
","<p>First we need a primer on I, P and B frames.  An I frame is a frame that is a completely independant picture of the frame.  It doesn't depend on any other frames and is a frame which B and P frames are based on.  A P frame stores only the changes from the previous frame and a B frame stores only the changes in either direction.  IPB uses a mix of all 3 frame types in a set sequence to capture video with much lower data usage, but every P and B frame is an approximation of what the frame that was originally captured was.  They are not exact.</p>

<p>For the same size I frame, all I will ALWAYS be better quality, however, it could be possible for IPB to be better if the camera has a set limit rate for I frame that could end up with larger I frames for the IPB due to the saved space, but that would depend on the exact data rates used by the camera.  The theory behind it would be to say we have all I with 3k per frame (making this number up completely) then we have 30 pictures of whatever quality we can get out of 3k.  Now, if the IPB frame, if we had say 1k per frame on average, but the P and B frames are very small, then it might be possible for the I frame to use 5k of data and the P and B frames to use only .5k each and result in a higher overall quality.</p>

<p>This would depend on the quality of the motion and the data rates being used by the camera however.  In most cases, recording all I on the camera is probably going to produce I frames equal or larger in size than those in IPB.  However, when doing a final output, the highest quality for a given size will almost always be compressing to IPB.  All I will also capture fast motion better since the difference between frames will be larger.</p>

","<p>Well, its a bit of a generic question.
Almost like asking how to take a movie like shot using your camera.</p>

<p>The answer is equally generic.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lighting, to prevent blowout or shadows take the shot when its cloudy, or near sunrise or sunset. (Unless you wanted a grunge harsh hot feel and maybe over exposed is the effect you are after, so take it at noon).</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the light is behind you so you capture the image flush.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you take shots in scenes. A closeup of peddling (running alongside with a macro lens can work). Take a closeup shot. Take a shot that first places them in the scene (unless you are adding mystery and sometimes you place that scene at the end).</p></li>
<li><p>Tell a story, have an element in the foreground like a thumbs up to hitch a ride, out of focus is the rider coming up, then comes into focus the thumb is blurred. Then cut reaction shot, or maybe maybe headphones not seeing shot. etc, I mean just go with the story, and tell the story with your shots.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess I could also go with settings, I am a big fan of large apertures (low f stops) like f2.0 - f4.0. And high shutter speed 1/125th or higher to minimize blur on fast moving objects, again depending how you want the end result to look, all these rules can be broken. Large apertures (low f stops)  tends to create a bokeh effect (out of focus the background if focus is on subject) making it obvious to the audience what is the focus of the story.</p></li>

<pre><code>[Parsed_cropdetect_0 @ 000000000625baa0] x1:0 x2:1279 y1:1 y2:718 w:1280 h:704 x:0 y:8 pts:7888683985 t:81953.624278 crop=1280:704:0:8

</code></pre>

<p>The stream itself starts at timestamp <code>81825.820733</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Duration: 01:38:00.24, start: 81825.820733, bitrate: 12748 kb/s
</code></pre>

<p>With all that information, I tried to cut the desired part out (and also removing streams I don't need) and convert everything into an MKV. It turned out I don't need to crop, so I can simply copy everything:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i ""recording_xyz.ts"" -ss 81953.0 -to 87259.0 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s copy -map 0:0 -map 0:3 -avoid_negative_ts 1 -reset_timestamps 1 ""archive_file.mkv""
</code></pre>

<p>The result is an empty MKV file.</p>

<p>What would be the correct way to use ffmpeg to cut a specific scene identified by the timestamps out?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Most important here is the <code>start: 81824.820733</code> information from the second line. Keep this number in mind.</p>

<p>Now we need our desired start and stop timestamps. <code>ffplay</code> can be paused by the space key. Pause at the desired start and the desired end. You can ""navigate"" the stream by clicking with the mouse in the ffplay video window. The beginning of the stream is left, the end is at the right border of the window.</p>

<p>When paused, you can read the following on the console:</p>

<pre><code>[Parsed_cropdetect_0 @ 000000000625baa0] x1:0 x2:1279 y1:1 y2:718 w:1280 h:704 x:0 y:8 pts:7888683985 t:81953.624278 crop=1280:704:0:8
</code></pre>

<p>You see again a timestamp here, marked with <code>t:</code>. In this example, the value is <code>81953.624278</code>. Same goes for the desired end of the stream. In our example, this is <code>87259.194348</code>.</p>

<p>With this information, you can easily calculate the values for ffmpeg's <code>-ss</code> and <code>-to</code> parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let <code>b</code> be the stream start timestamp (here <code>81824.820733</code>)</li>
<li>Let <code>s</code> be the desired start timestamp (here <code>81953.624278</code>)</li>
<li>Let <code>e</code> be the desired end timestamp (here <code>87259.194348</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The relative starting point (in seconds) is <code>s - b = 81953.624278 - 81824.820733 = 128.803545</code>. For the relative ending point (in seconds): <code>e - b = 87259.194348 - 81824.820733 = 5434.373615</code>. Convert the seconds now to the format <code>hh:mm:ss.msec</code>. For convenience, you might want to use this little Python script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/env python3

def ts_format(d: float) -&gt; str:
    hrs = int(d)
    rest = float(d - hrs) * float(60)
    mins = int(rest)
    rest = float(rest - mins) * float(60)
    secs = int(rest)
    rest = float(rest - secs) * float(1000)
    msec = int(rest)
    return '{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}.{:03d}'.format(hrs, mins, secs, msec)


def main() -&gt; bool:
    base = input('Base timestamp: ')
    starting = input('Desired start timestamp: ')
    ending = input('Desired end timestamp: ')
    start_hr = (float(starting) - float(base)) / float(3600)
    end_hr = (float(ending) - float(base)) / float(3600)
    print('Start: {:s} | End: {:s}'.format(ts_format(start_hr), ts_format(end_hr)))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>With the example above, you'll receive the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Start: 00:02:08.803 | End: 01:30:34.373
</code></pre>

<p>With this information, you can use ffmpeg:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i recording_xyz.ts -ss 00:02:08.803 -to 01:30:34.373 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s copy -map 0:0 -map 0:3 -avoid_negative_ts 1 -reset_timestamps 1 ""archive.mkv""
</code></pre>

<p>I tried this with several recordings, and it always worked well. It is also very easy to incorporate cropping if necessary:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i recording_xyz.ts -ss 00:02:08.803 -to 01:30:34.373 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset fast -tune film -vf ""crop=1280:704:0:8"" -c:a copy -c:s copy -map 0:0 -map 0:3 -avoid_negative_ts 1 -reset_timestamps 1 ""archive.mkv""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Potential pitfalls</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If the recording goes over midnight, you might experience a lower timestamp at the end of the stream compared to the beginning timestamp. You need to find the timestamp values around the break: The highest one before the break, and the lowest after the break. For calculating the desired end, you need to add the value at the end, the distance between the stream start and the highest value before the break and the distance between the lowest value after the break and the desired ending timestamp.</li>
<li>The method for finding your desired start and end point is very unprecise. In my humble opinion, this is OK for TV recordings.</li>
<li>The method is not suitable for removing commercials.</li>

"Why is there a “2D” disc in every Blu-Ray 3D package?","1925","","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc#Blu-ray_3D"">Wikipedia</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MPEG4-MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical 50% overhead compared to equivalent 2D content, and can provide full 1080p resolution backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray Disc players.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if a Blu-Ray 3D is completely backwards compatible to a regular Blu-Ray, why do all consumer Blu-Ray-3D packages contain a 2D as well as a 3D disc? Is that just marketing (so people will even buy it if they don’t yet have a 3D-capable setup) or is there some technical reason behind this?</p>
","<p>Disk space.  The 3d content takes more space so there is generally not enough room for special features.  The 2d special features are only on the 2d disk.  They take up the room that the second eye takes on the 3d disk.  They could make a special features only disk, but this is generally more expensive since it requires another master and another production line.  It's more cost effective and better marketing to just include the 2D copy.</p>

Changing the length would cancel the action of the pins on the revolving cylinder so that is not a good idea.</p>

<p>If you think the scale you have meets your tuning definition then it would be far easier to make a new scroll to change to the melodic and harmonic content you desire. If you are starting from scratch and have the tools you should make a system to be able to change the scrolls so you have a diversity of songs.</p>

"Lossless conversion of yuv420p10le to yuv420p","1899","","<p>I have an mp4 movie, containing an <code>h264</code> video stream (pixel format <code>yuv420p10le</code>), and an <code>AAC</code> audio stream.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
","<p>No this is not possible. Looking at this theoretically disregarding the codec you can not take away information and call it lossless, thats already a terminology problem.</p>

<p>Applying a new color space without transcoding is also not possible
It's not so easy to say whether this is even possible with certain codecs other than h264, it really depends on how you define certain terminology.</p>

<p>Regarding h264 its simply not possible in the way the codec works, color information is essential in how the codec encodes frames as its based on motion estimation and the color information between frames is what defines the in between frames that don't hold the information of a whole frame but only the differences between keyframes.
So just applying different color values to each existing pixel is not really possible. It would result in major artifacts.</p>

","<p>There isn't really an alternative to x264vfw. Are you sure the error is with the codec and not your application? It's in wide use, such a major bug would definitely be found.</p>

<p>Also be aware that h264 doesn't work in a frame by frame basis unless you encode only intra frames.
VP80 is NOT h264, just a similar codec.</p>

<p>If you need to develop an app you probably want to turn to a commercial h264 implementation like MainConcepts Codec SDK: <a href=""http://www.mainconcept.com/products/sdks/codec-sdk/video/h264avc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mainconcept.com/products/sdks/codec-sdk/video/h264avc.html</a>

"ffmpeg concat introduces a/v sync problem","1888","","<p>I have one 2-hour video file and want to add a 10-second title sequence to its start. The long file has perfect a/v sync from start to finish. However, when I use <code>ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy outfile.mp4</code> to concatenate the title file to the long file, the audio in the long file gradually goes out of sync, progressively becoming worse until at the end of 2 hours, the audio is a full second or two behind the video.  I can understand why the <code>concat</code> might break the synchronization, but I don't understand why it would  cause the synchronization to become progressively worse. </p>

<p>I want to avoid re-encoding the long file to maintain quality. If necessary, I can re-encode the title file because it's just white text on a black background.</p>

<p>I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions. I'm a digital video semi-noob and have faced a steep learning curve, but I am learning. I'm using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and ffmpeg 2.8.6-1ubuntu2, which I think is the latest ffmpeg version.  I have about 20 old 2-hour family video cassettes that I am digitizing. </p>

<p>File background:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The long file is an MP4 file using H264 and AAC. It originated as a .ts file and I use ffmpeg to encode it into the mp4 format. Before concatenating the title file, it is in perfect a/v sync at all times. It's 720x480, with 127 audio bitrate.  I captured the video from a Sony Handycam Video8 tape using a Hauppauge Live-2 USB converter, using the VLC CLI to generate the original .ts file. It's about 120 minutes long.</p></li>
<li><p>The title file I created in Blender, and tried to duplicate the long file's format: 720x480, 127 audio bitrate, MP4 containing H264 and AAC. It actually has no audio, as it's just two ""slides"" of text. (I know that there probably is actually an audio track generated by Blender, but it's just silence as I don't add any audio tracks to the simple titles.) It's only 10 seconds long.</p></li>

<p>and then run concat with the new title video.</p>

<p>Modern containers like MP4 have <strong>P</strong>resentation <strong>T</strong>ime<strong>S</strong>tamps, which are denominated with reference to a timebase. So, if the timebase value is 1/500 and a frame's PTS is 200, then that tells the video player to show that frame at 200*(1/500) = 0.4 seconds. The <code>tbn</code> values shown in the readouts are the reciprocals of this timebase. Now, the concat demuxer, due to a design oversight (or choice!?) does not rescale the PTS values so that all inputs have frames with PTS using the same timebase. Your two videos have different TBs, and so the long video after the concat is being sped up. The difference is perceptually invisible - except for the audio drift. That <code>tbn</code> value is for the video stream. Audio streams have their own timebase, related to the sample rate, which is the same here. </p>

<p>It is my understanding that <code>q=</code> stands for quality, and should probably be as close to <code>0</code> as possible, while a low number close to <code>q=31</code> indicates poor quality and that ffmpeg has difficulties reaching an acceptable bitrate.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>Here's what I've tried and the results so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I <strong>reinstalled</strong> Premiere Pro CC 2015.</li>
<li>I tried from <strong>different cameras.</strong> The issue persists in every case. I've tried with H.264 from a Canon 5Dmk3 as well as with ProRes 422 HQ from a Black Magic Cinema Camera.</li>
<li>I tried footage from <strong>different shoots.</strong> Same problem.</li>
<li>I created a brand <strong>new project</strong> and imported new footage. It still distorted while paused.</li>
<li>I rebooted my Mac in <strong>safe mode,</strong> created a brand new project, and the picture wasn't distorted. It was, however, cropped down to only show 25% (the lower-left corner of the picture).</li>
<li>I tested in Final Cut Pro X 10.2.1. No problems here.</li>
<li>I tested in Speedgrade CC 2015. Same problem as Premiere.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally it renders OK, but when I've tried to render to MPEG the distortion persists in every 2nd frame.</p>

<h3>My setup</h3>

<p>Here's the hardware and software combination I'm running on. If I hadn't successfully eliminated the distortion in safe mode, I'd think my OS was the issue. It may be, but this issue did not occur in 10.11's safe mode.</p>

<ul>
<li>Premiere CC 2015</li>
<li>OS X 10.11.5 (the public beta of El Capitan)</li>
<li>MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)</li>
<li>2.6 GHz Intel Core i7</li>
<li>16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB</li>

<p>What next step(s) should I take to resolve this issue? (Or, what else can I do to understand it more deeply?)</p>

"Delete unused video clips in Vegas","1857","","<p>After finishing editing a video with Sony's <em>Movie Studio Platinum 12.0</em>, I'm left with a giant folder of uncompressed rushes. I would like to delete some of them to save disk space.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to keep only the video files that I have used in a project ?</p>
","<p>I use Vegas Pro, but I think this applies to the Movie Studio version as well. As far as I know there is no magic clean up button that removes the unused files from your folder. However, if you go to the 'project media' tab in Vegas, you will see reference icons of all the files that were used during your editing session including jpegs, and .wav files. This is an accumulation, so if you pulled a clip in and then decided to delete it from the timeline it will still show up here until you click the button with the lightning bolt icon, this updates this folder so it will show you everything that is currently on the timeline.</p>

<p>This can be your reference to manually remove from the folder outside of Vegas. Caution: if you delete a file that is in the timeline, Vegas will complain and ask you for the location of the file the next time you launch this session. Likewise, if you move or rename any clips that were in the timeline, Vegas will treat this like a lost file and you will have to show Vegas where it is.</p>

"Which software gets the fastest rendering times?","1854","","<p>I'm sure there are benchmarks out there, but I'm not sure where to find them. Circa 2006 I was holding on to Vegas 6 without letting go because I could see very noticeable differences in its rendering times. (It's super fast!) And I've made fun of people who tough it out with Final Cut or Premiere for its atrociously slow rendering times. I'm just curious if anyone benchmarks this stuff.</p>
","<p>I'm not sure that it is necessarily possible to get meaningful benchmarks for video editing render times now.  With the advent of system's using GPU processing for rendering, the already complicated field got even tougher.  There are simply too many variables.  It depends on the performance of particular effects and plugins and what kind of hardware and bandwidth needs there are within the project.  Since the needs of projects differ so greatly, I don't see how a meaningful benchmark could be established unless it was to try benchmarking individual filters within the applications.</p>

<p>In general, the new render engine in Premiere is very fast though.  Even for software only it works quick, but with GPU acceleration, it gets pretty crazy.  Running software only, I can run a full resolution all I frame 1080p 24fps signal with color correction applied through my tower with fairly minimal frame drops.  I'm unfortunately PC only so I can't compare to FCPX.</p>

"Easy way of editing keyframes in adobe Premiere","1818","","<p>I'm a first time adobe premiere user. I can get the results I want after a fashion, but I find the methods I use way to cumbersome. I was wondering if you guys could point me some shortcuts.</p>

<p>I have two video streams from two camera's (slides &amp; stage). I fade over from one camera to the next depending on what happens. I have added both streams to the sequence and just turn the opacity of the top stream to 0 when I want to show the bottom stream.</p>

<p>I have a large bunch of timecodes for when I want to make a fade-over. However, the default fade is way to slow. So I have to now: </p>

<ol>
<li>go to the time code</li>
<li>add a keyframe</li>
<li>drag the frame to 0 or 100</li>
<li>right click selecte bezier</li>
<li>drag the bezier handle upwards enough that the fade speed is acceptable</li>
</ol>

<p>That's a lot of mouse work, fiddlings and clickings. I have found the effect controls which allow me to fine tune the controls, but still with a lot of imprecise mouse moving.</p>

<p>I would love to have a way to just specify all keyframes and bezier parameters in a text file or so, so I can quickly edit them change all bezier parameters for all keyframes at the same time and be able to twiddle the results. Another possibility would be to copy keyframe settings, apply settings to multiple keyframes at once or to define keyframe 'classes' or so.</p>

<p>Even more so, I'm just learning premiere so I sometimes make rooky mistakes. For example by picking the wrong sequence framerate (I think) i managed to create a result that flickered heavily. I can't edit sequence settings so I had to create a new sequence. But I can't find how to copy markers or keyframes from one sequence to another. So I have to set them all over again :(</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I can improve the efficiency of this process? Or maybe I shouldn't be using keyframes and opacity at all?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>
","<h2>Adjusting the default video transition duration</h2>

<p>Go to <code>Preferences -&gt; General</code> and change the <code>Video Transition Default Duration</code> to a frame amount of your choice.</p>

<h2>Optimising current workflow</h2>

<p>I can think of some optimalisations regarding your current workflow. It's not a drastic change, but might help you do the task faster.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would suggest splitting the timecode list per videotrack (slide &amp; stage) according to the following scheme:</p>

<p>List 1: slide fade-outs<br>
List 2: slide fade-ins<br>
List 3: stage fade-outs<br>
List 4: stage fade-ins  </p>

<p>List 1 should match list 4 and list 2 should match list 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the first fade-out on a list. Create a keyframe pattern you like for the fade-out, for example the one shown below:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYtyT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the effects panel it looks like this:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8RfW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A linear keyframe followed by a bezier keyframe followd by a hold keyframe.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>Now select those three keyframes in the effect panel by dragging a rectangle around them or clicking each keyframe while holding <code>ctrl</code> (Windows) <code>cmd</code> (Mac).</p></li>
<li><p>Right click and press <code>Copy</code></p></li>
<li><p>Now go to each fade-out timecode on both video tracks (so list 1 and 3) and in the effects panel right click and press <code>Paste</code>. Of course you can also hit <code>ctrl+V</code> or <code>cmd+V</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat this process for list 2 and 4.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In this way you only have to set the bezier speed once and just copy paste the keyframe sequence at each timecode.</p>

<h2>Exporting keyframe locations to textfile</h2>

<p>I'm not aware of a way to do this directly, but if you export your project to a Final Cut Pro XML or to EDL (Select sequence, then: <code>File -&gt; Export</code>) you have the ability to change the position of /add keyframes through a text editor by editing the <code>.edl</code> or <code>.xml</code> files . You can then import the <code>.edl</code> or <code>.xml</code> file into Premiere Pro as a new sequence.
However, these formats do not support bezier keyframes.</p>

"How to keyframe a crop in Premiere Pro CC","1795","","<p>I am working on a school project, and it starts off with a 5 second count up that takes up the full screen. I am using the prebuilt <em>insert timecode</em> effect built into Premiere. What I have done is cropped all but the minutes and seconds out of the view.</p>

<p>What I would like to do next is to transition it to the bottom right corner while shrinking it.</p>

<p>Any help/advice would be welcome. If theres another program that does it easier, then feel free to let me know.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Here is what I have:

","<p>Before I start I'd like to mention that this would be much easier in After Effects. If you plan on doing this more often, you should consider learning AE to be able to do things like that faster.</p>

<p>So, to follow your approach I created a transparent layer, put the timecode effect on it and cropped it using the crop effect. It looks like this right now:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8DAs.png"" alt=""stage 1""></p>

<p>Since you want to resize and move it, you'll need to activate the animation for two parameters in the effects panel: The ""size"" parameter of the timecode effect and the ""position"" parameter under the motion effect (which is applied to each clip by default). You can do this by clicking the clock symbol next to the parameters name (see the next image). Make sure that your playhead (in the timeline) is at position 00:00, since activating the animation will create a keyframe at the current position.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AgaRV.png"" alt=""stage2""></p>

<p>Now, move the playhead to the point where you want the animation to end (i.e. the timecode has arrived at your desired position and size). First, alter the percentage value of the ""size"" parameter of the Timecode effect. A keyframe will automatically be created (see the small diamond shape in the timeline next to the effect settings panel). Then, adjust the ""position"" parameter of the motion effect. Again, a keyframe will automatically created. Adjust both parameters until you're happy with size and position. Then you're basically done.</p>

The Saturation setting in the Primary settings doesn't give any such control, so I'm assuming I need to break the footage in it's RGB components and work on each separately, however I can't find a way to split and recombine them so that I end up with a monochrome image.</p>

"Can Sony Vegas Pro be used or compared to the output produced by Final Cut Pro for professional use?","1775","","<p>I am a PC user and use Sony Vegas Pro. I really like it for editing purposes. I do not like Adobe Premier or Avid which work on Windows and believe that the top 3 tools are AVID, Sony Vegas, and Premier. Can Vegas be used for professional productions today or semi pro; is the quality and tools up to notch? Can it compare to Final Cut Pro which I see professionals use?</p>

<p>The criteria can vary but in general if it is feasible. </p>
","<p>Vegas is a mature, full-featured NLE. I use it regularly for professional work from spots, to corporate video to feature films. I've also used it for semi-professional things like editing a video of my stepdaughter's choir concert for a Christmas DVD.</p>

<p>Here's where I run into problems. My producing partner is all about FCP. There's no clean way to export an EDL between our two systems so that we can BOTH edit. We work around it. If there's something with Sony's proprietary HD format that's somewhere between HDV and XDCAM, or DSLR footage from a Nikon, I edit because Vegas imports those clips easily. When FCP imports those formats, it ranges from not recognizing the file to displaying interlace artifacts. On the other hand, my Vegas setup chokes on Canon HDV, so that gets edited on FCP.</p>

<p>Whether using FCP or Vegas, the output is comparable, I'm not saying identical because of inherent differences in how MacOS/FCP and Windows/Vegas implement the various output codecs. Needless to say, though, our material from FCP and Vegas has been used in every media from Broadcast to family videos. </p>

<p>The tool, in and of itself, it not the issue. Professionalism comes from a.) the footage and b.) the skill of the editor. Shoot a corporate video with the onboard mic, no tripod and no lights and Eisenstein himself couldn't make that a professional looking edit. Conversely, light and mic a two year old's dance recital, shoot it with three Steadicams for proper coverage, and you'll get something worthy of a broadcast dance show. </p>

<p>It's just that for some projects, I need a phillips head and for some I need a flathead. It doesn't matter if Vegas in the flathead or the phillips and FCP the other. Which one is the best for the job? No one's comparing MSPaint to Vegas...it's just a tool, and if you use it right, you'll be very pleased wit the results. </p>

"Why must a sample rate by at least twice a frequency in order to reproduce that frequency accurately?","1769","","<p>I read this:
To reproduce a given frequency, the sample rate must be at least twice that frequency.
Why is this so?</p>
","<p>That's Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Think about it in the other way: imagine you are given a set of samples (the black dots in the image).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/05b9o.png"" alt=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ld5VI.png""></p>

<p>The most intuitive way to recover the original analog signal would be by joining these samples. But you can easily notice that there is not a unique way of joining them. In fact, there are infinite possible signals that would contain the whole set of samples. Obviously, given the sample set, you would join them the easiest way, i.e. the blue signal.</p>

<p>Now, what about sampling? In the image you also have a red signal (which frequency is 1 Hz) that has been sampled too slowly, resulting in the black dot sample set. To have a clue about the real signal, we should have sampled it at, at least, 2 Hz. That way, we also would have samples (dots) at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc seconds. And, as you can draw in Paint, the easiest path to join all the samples would be, again, the red signal. So we would have recovered our original signal successfully.</p>

","<p>The easiest way I can think of would be to actually do it as multiple videos and stills.  Have the first video play and then go to a still of the last frame.  The next would be the next video clip followed by the still.  Continue doing that for the length of it.  Not sure if it works like that in Keynote or not, but that's how I'd do it in any of my sequencing/presentation packages.</p>

<p>After a lot of messing around I figured out how to get it to work and will post the answer.</p>

<p>The reason I actually want to do this is because my main OS drive is an SSD and there's not really enough space to install the whole Adobe suite on it.</p>
","<p>After a long time of messing aroung I got it to work by tricking the software into thinking it was actually in the default location it likes at 'C:\Program Files\Adobe' by creating directory junctions. In order for it to work the hard drive must be formatted with the NTFS filesystem.</p>

<p>I used <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/symlinker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/symlinker/</a> to create the directory junctions. You need to map the following folders to folders on the other hard drive you want to install the suite on. Run the symlinker software as an administrator.</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Adobe</li>
<li>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe</li>
<li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe</li>
<li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure that you select <strong>Directory Junction</strong> in the dropdown for type of link otherwise it won't work.</p>

<p>In the symlink program the box which says 'give a name to the link' is the folder name. So for example to set up the first path you would enter 'C:\Program Files' in the top box. Then 'Adobe' as the link name and then '[New Drive]:\Adobe From Link' (as an example) in the third box and then do the same for the other 3 and they all need to go to different folders.</p>

<p>Then when you've done this and checked that the folders are being mapped correctly you can simply install the adobe suite into C:\Program Files\Adobe (where it wants to go) and it will actually set itself up on your other hard drive.</p>

<p>I know it's not common to even think about putting it on another hard drive but I had to and I hope this will be useful if there's someone else out there that ever needs to and will save a lot of time!</p>

What I would like to do is ultimately combine them (mkvmerge widescreen.mkv + fullscreen.mkv) and to do that I need matching display aspect ratios.</p>

<p>So I would like to pillarbox the 4:3 video as I encode it, and then hopefully append it to the 16:9 video.  I've tried a number of filters to accomplish this, and the closest I was able to get was a slightly wider than expected video, otherwise pillarboxed properly.</p>

<p>However, the resulting display of the fullscreen video is pillarboxed, yet slightly horizontally stretched.  In 1:1 pixels it measures 720px across, not 640.</p>

<p>I figure I'm doing the math wrong, or misunderstanding how the filters are supposed to operate, or something simple, but my understanding of ffmpeg video filters is basically nothing.</p>
","<p>Assuming both MKVs are rips of NTSC DVDs, these are the commands you need:</p>

<p>So my question is, how can I use <code>ffmpeg</code> to arrive at a Codec ID of 3gp6 along with a format of MPEG-4 Visual and a profile of Simple@L1?  I've been unsuccessfully Googling and experimenting on this for hours.</p>
","<p>I asked on the ffmpeg-users mailing list, and it was suggested that I add <code>-brand 3gp6</code> to my encoding command.  This achieved the result in <code>mediainfo</code> that I was looking for.  However, it remains to be seen whether this really reaches the same compatibility with older hardware that YouTube's 3GP files have.  I don't have any old hardware to test with, lol.  Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, problem solved for now!</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, here is the command I ended up with for reproducing YouTube's ""Format 36"", which is a 360x180 3GP video with about 230 Kbps overall bitrate:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input-file.mov -vcodec mpeg4 -s 320x180 -qscale:v 20 -brand 3gp6 \
    -vf 'scale=iw*sar:ih,pad=max(iw\,ih*(16/9)):ow/(16/9):(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2' \
    -acodec libfaac -ar 22050 -ac 1 -qscale:a 70 output-file.3gp
</code></pre>

<p>And here is what I came up with for reproducing its ""Format 17"", which is a 176x144 3GP video with about 82 Kbps overall bitrate:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input-file.mov -vcodec mpeg4 -s 176x144 -qscale:v 12 -r 10 -level 8 -brand 3gp6 \

    acodec libfaac -ar 22050 -ac 1 -qscale:a 45 output-file.3gp

"Puppet tool - how do I make the arms stay attached to the same points on the body?","1659","","<p>Trying to make following character's body wiggle a bit, using the <strong>puppet tool</strong>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTdIg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The face and arms are on separate layers as they will need to move independently. When the body moves via the puppet pins, the face and arms stay in their original positions. <strong>How can I 'attach' them to their assigned positions on the body?</strong> </p>
","<p>If you put a puppet pin at the point where the arms attach, then you can tie the position of the arm layer to the position of the puppet pin using an expression. This will attach the layer to the puppet pin, allowing you to move the pin and the layer it is on and have the arm follow.</p>

<p>It's easy to do, with no knowledge of scripting really required.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QgB9y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So say your body layer is called <code>""Body""</code> and it has a puppet pin called <code>""L_Shoulder""</code>, which is on the body at the point where you want to attach the left arm. The left arm layer should have its anchor point at the point that you want it to pivot on, which coresponds to the <code>L_Shoulder</code> on the body layer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g81hW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here's what you do:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, make the arm layer a child of the body.</li>
<li>Now apply an expression to its position property (hit <kbd>alt/opt</kbd> and click on the stopwatch). </li>
</ul>

<p>The expression we want is this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>thisComp.layer(""Body"").effect(""Puppet"").arap.mesh(""Mesh 1"").deform(""L_Shoulder"").position
</code></pre>

<p>This looks very difficult to type, but fortunately we don't have to. Next to the expression editor text box is a pickwhip, that we can use to select properties and values. After you <kbd>alt/option</kbd>-click the stopwatch, drag the pickwhip to the position property of the puppet pin, and it will fill it all in for you.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j88bh.png"" alt=""pickwhip""></p>

<p>Because the puppet pin positions are relative to the layer this works well. As the arm is a parent of the child, setting its position relative to the body layer is exactly what you want.</p>

<p>If the arm is not a child of the body it gets much more complicated: you have to use the <code>toComp</code> method of the body layer to get the relative position of the pin to the composition space, and then you have to apply expressions to link the other transformation properties of the body layer, but it can be done.</p>

"What's the difference between a DVCAM tape that is mini and a MiniDV tape?","1640","","<p>What exactly is the difference between a DVCAM tape that is mini and a MiniDV tape? They look pretty much the same in terms of size. It seems like Sony is making DVCAM tapes that are the same size as MiniDV tapes now, and it’s getting hard to tell what, if anything, is different. I’m cataloging videos that have either been captured on tapes that say DVCAM, MiniDV, and some tapes that actually have both DVCAM and MiniDv printed on them. I’m basically trying to figure out what I should put as the ""media format."" Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Originally there was miniDV which is a standard consumer tape format (using ME tape) holding DV (at the time DV wasn't really a file format in it's own right).</p>

<p>Sony released a professional version of this called DVCAM with locked audio and which records at a shallower angle, running tape faster at the expense of running time, to reduce dropout.  </p>

<p>You could use either DVCAM tapes (now known as DVCAM-L) which as well as holding more tape for longer runtimes used higher quality MP tape, or you could record on miniDV tapes in either DV mode (to remain compatible with miniDV cameras) or in DVCAM mode to take advantage of the better format.  (The larger tape format uses the same width tape so the same head is used for either.) More recently DVCAM mini tapes have been available which use the better quality tape in the smaller package.</p>

<p>So DVCAM encompasses a file format, a recording format, the larger tape format and a marque of professional quality tape in the mini size tapes.  DVCAM mini and miniDV tapes are interchangable but they are branded towards their intended use and there is a general difference in quality/price between the two.</p>

<p>In your case regardless of the brands written on the actual tape you should probably use miniDV if it holds DV and DVCAM or DVCAM mini if it holds DVCAM.  If there is nothing recorded on the tape then it is suitable for either.</p>

<p>As soon as i want to watch these videos somewhere else, I can't. The software uses some codec apparently belonging to GoPro and obviously most common players won't play anything.
I already tried to convert the video to a wider accepted format(codec) but I wouldn't get anything I could watch. It either only used the first view pictures and then went black or 
the video was entirely black.</p>

<p>I was able to play my timelines in real-time just fine (preview format DNx 115 1080p 23.976) until installing Miraizon DNxHD / ProRes codec.

"Smartphone vs camcorder","1619","","<p>Okay, so I'm a young A/V tech, and I'm looking into picking up some equipment for video recording. The guy who is mentoring me said that for the kind of work I do, which is primarily speaking events indoors, with varied lighting, I want a camera with at least ½"" sensor.</p>

<p>The Canon XA20 Professional Camcorder seemed to be the best choice for the money, but then I got thinking, phones have come a long way, so when I looked it up, the Samsung Galaxy S6 has a ½"" sensor and is capable of shooting 2160p@30fps or 1080p@60fps video, which compared to the camcorders 1080 @ 59.94p seems like it's pretty good, minus the fact that you can't get the same zoom on the phone.</p>

<p>So for the same price of the camcorder, I could pick up two S6s plus accessories and ask for roughly the same price or less that the camcorder with no accessories.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything here? Would love to hear what I'm missing being an amateur and all. If anyone would have a better suggestion on how to maximise our invest my money, I'd love to hear them. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:
Okay, so to add some clarity, I was just asking about video. My experience is almost completely in audio, and I always use separate equipment for that.
Also, when I'm talking about speaking events, I'm currently only dealing with small groups under 75 people, so I can get the cameras pretty close to the speakers without intruding on the group's attention. My only major issue to date is lack of lighting.</strong></p>
","<p>There are a few things you are missing, and a few more you just aren't fully appreciating how much of a difference the things you mentioned make.</p>

<p>First, the S6 sensor is not over 1/2 inch, it is 1/2.6 inch, which is substantially smaller than a 1/2 inch sensor, particularly since sensors are measured diagonally.  </p>

<p>Second, lenses matter a lot more than the sensor.  The inability to zoom optically is a deal breaker for what you are trying to do with covering speaking events.  Typically, video is a secondary concern to a live audience and camera positions will be far off to avoid impacting visibility.  Without strong optics, you will not be able to get the footage you need.</p>

<p>Third, most (all?) cellphones do not use a global shutter, while most camcorders do.  Global shutters ensure that an entire frame is captured at the same time instead of scanning line by line while the frame is exposing.  The lack of a global shutter results in the ""jello"" effect that you can see when you pan a camera quickly.  Global shutter is a bit less of a concern for fixed camera position shooting at a relatively static target, but it is still work mentioning.</p>

<p>Forth, reliability.  Smartphones are more likely to crash than a stand alone video camera, they are subject to recording length limits that may interfere with your recordings.  They will have lower battery life while shooting which may also cause issues and the S6 in particular does not have a replaceable battery at all, so when you are out of juice, you are done unless you have an external battery pack that can keep up with sufficient juice.  Even then, it's a disadvantage to the much more compact battery placement directly on a camcorder.</p>

<p>Fifth, stability.  While you can get tripod mounts for a smartphone, camcorders are built from the ground up to support tripod mounting in a secure way.  You can work around that on the smart phone with complicated cases and mounting systems, but those also drive up the cost.  When shooting off a tripod, camcorders also still have a stability advantage.  You can hold them up to your eye and form a 3 point support that is easily held steady.  Accomplishing the same with a phone would require expensive rigging running up in to hundreds or possibly over $1000 unless you want to try to do custom fabrication yourself.</p>

<p>There are probably a few other things I'm missing too as I've just been writing these from what has come to mind as I go.  Smartphones are up to the point where they can make a pretty decent (though less durable and more expensive) alternative to a go pro, but they are really not an alternative for a camcorder by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

The solve is easier with more reference images that have been taken from different angles looking at the same scene.</p>

<p>As was mentioned above looking for key signs in the photo that give hints for y-axis and z-axis will help you align your scene. If you Place grids down you can try to ballpark the perspective of the shot and give yourself a good horizon line. You can also place proxy geometry of some of the objects in your scene to guess depth and so on. Many of these techniques are what is used to match CG to video.</p>

<p>In the end the more information you have about the original physical scene is what will make matching CG easier. such as actual dimensions of the scene and as many measurements as possible.

"Troubleshooting XDCAM import into Premirere Pro CC 2014","1605","","<p>I am in the middle of editing a TV spot we create bi-weekly and therefore on a tight timeline.

I get error: ""The importer reported a generic error"". I'll say that I've been using prores on this same system a bunch of times, however it was a different possibly less savey person who did this transcode and so it is possibly still suspect.</p>

"Differences Tamron f/2.8 28-75 / 24-70","1591","","<p>I'd like to buy one of those two lenses for filming with a EOS 600D:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tamron SP AF 28-75mm F/2.8 XR Di LD Aspherical [IF] MACRO</li>
<li>Tamron SP 24-70mm F/2.8 Di VC USD</li>
</ul>

<p>I am aware of the following differencies of the two lenses.</p>

<p>Advantages 28-75mm:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some websites claim this lense to be parfocal, which might be interesting for filming.</li>
<li>It's lighter (510g vs 825g)</li>
<li>Slightly lower minimum object distance (33 vs 38cm)</li>
<li>It costs less than half of the 24-70</li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages 24-70mm:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vibration compensation (which I always switch off during filming)</li>
<li>USD motor (which doesn't seem to be important for filming)</li>
</ul>

<p>From that the 28-75 clearly seems to be the better choice. </p>

<p>Is there anything I am missing? Are there any other points to consider?</p>
","<p>Yes, there is a lot you are missing.  </p>

<p>The 24-70 has substantially better transmittance (more light makes it through the lens), slightly better sharpness, significantly less chromatic aberration, 2 more diaphragm blades (better, more round bokeh), full time manual focus (can auto-focus at the start of a shot but still adjust after starting shooting).  </p>

<p>Also, image stabilization can be very helpful when shooting video.  If you are on a tripod you shouldn't, but if you are shooting free-hand, it is a good thing unless you need quick, lag free panning (which would be a problem due to your rolling shutter on a 600d anyway).</p>

<p>While I don't recommend putting too much stock in the overall score that DXoMark produces, there individual discreet stat comparisons are generally reasonably good.  You can find the comparison for these two lenses on the 700D listed <a href=""http://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Compare/Side-by-side/Tamron-SP-24-70mm-F28-Di-VC-USD-Canon-on-Canon-EOS-700D-versus-SP-AF28-75mm-f-2.8-XR-Di-LD-Aspherical-IF-Canon-on-Canon-EOS-700D___884_870_297_870"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

"Convert variable framerate ~60 FPS to constant 60 FPS losslessly","1574","","<p>I have gameplay footage recorded with ShadowPlay (“GeForce Experience”) at 60 FPS, which as I understand results in variable frame rate, because the game drops frames sometimes. However, trying to use this video in Adobe Premiere results in the game audio severely falling behind the visuals, because Premiere treats it as if every frame was the same length.</p>

<p>I have tried HandBrake with these settings:</p>

<p>Quality: constant, RF 0 (lossless)<br>
FPS: 60, constant<br>
Detelecine: Off<br>
Decomb: Off<br>
Denoise: Off<br>
Deblock: Off</p>

<p>But the output video is not only much smaller than the source video, but it's massively worse in terms of visual quality. Why isn't it lossless when I've set it to what it claims is lossless?</p>

<p>Input video info: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/7Tss4brj"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://pastebin.com/7Tss4brj</a><br>
Output video info: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/DKFEzDKk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://pastebin.com/DKFEzDKk</a>
(from Mediainfo)</p>

<p>How can I convert a variable framerate video to a constant framerate video losslessly?</p>
","<p>To start with: your version of Handbrake is old. Version 1.0.3 came out very recently, it's got some improvements over that older version.</p>

<p>Second, CQ0 is not <em>actually</em> ""lossless."" It's aiming for ""lossless"" quality, but it's going to bump up against the data rate limitations of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Levels"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">H.264 Level</a>, so while it might need, say, 100MbPS at a given point to achieve ""lossless"" compression, Level 4.0 might be capping it at 20MbPS or something like that. Note in the Encoding Settings readout on your export file it lists ""vbv_maxrate=20000,"" that's where your bitrate is capped. So to get as close to lossless as possible you'd need something like Level 5.2.</p>

<p>So ratcheting up your H.264 level will improve quality, but Premiere may end up chugging very hard on it. H.264 is really bad for editing. It's very computationally complex, largely because it doesn't store each frame separately (called Intraframe compression) but it takes batches of frames (called a Group of Pictures, or GOP) and compresses them together, in such a way that any one frame within a GOP will depend on the surrounding frames in order to reproduce a complete image. This is called Interframe compression, and the number of frames in a GOP depends on the parameters set at encode time, and may even be variable (not typical), but you can see what those parameters in MediaInfo by noting the line that says ""Format settings, GOP"" (""N=30"" means 30 frames per GOP), or looking at the encoding settings where it notes ""keyint"" (Keyframe Interval). So needing to decode all 30 frames to show you any one frame is <em>very</em> CPU and RAM intensive.</p>

<p>If you've got the storage I'd recommend considering using DNxHD, which is a ""mezzanine"" (editing friendly) codec that preserves quality, considered ""virtually lossless,"" but has low CPU/RAM impact. The catch is very high bitrates. So we're talking ~130-200GB/hr at 1080p59.94. The other catch is that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Avid_DNxHD_resolutions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DNxHD has very limited supported resolutions and frame rates</a>. There's also CineForm which is just as high a quality, but far more flexible, and both CineForm and DNxHD are natively supported by Premiere (CineForm in 2015 and later) but last I checked CineForm support in other tools, like ffmpeg, is lacking.</p>

<p>So are more editing-friendly solution would be to use ffmpeg to make DNxHD with a command line the following:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i (input file).mp4 -c:v dnxhd -b:v 290M -c:a pcm_s16le -r 60 (output).mxf
</code></pre>

<p>That would make DNxHD with uncompressed audio in an MXF Op1a file. You could also whack .mov on the end there and make a Quicktime file instead just as easily. Note that -r sets the output frame rate. You could try using H.264 in ffmpeg by changing the video codec (-c:v), but you'll run into the same limitations as you would working with Handbrake, so I don't know if it's really worth it to go into that here.</p>

"green screen to transparent with ffmpeg","1572","","<p>ffmpeg does a very good job of getting rid of a green screen, with a command like this:</p>

            [0:v][ckout]overlay[out]"" 
       -map ""[out]""  output.mp4

<p>but it replaces the green screen with solid black, whereas I would like it replaced with a transparent background, alpha = 0.</p>

<p>I tried setting the color to <code>#00000000</code> (8 zeroes indicating a zero alpha), but that still resulted in a black background.</p>

<p>Strangely, when I set the color to say red, it gives a red tint to many unfiltered areas.</p>

<p>So I would like a transparent background, but I'm also curious what the color option is doing.</p>
","<p>Output by MP4 defaults to the H.264 codec for the video. H.264 does not support alpha.</p>

<p>You can output to <code>.mov</code> with a video codec <code>-c:v</code> of <code>png</code> or <code>qtrle</code>. There are others but they have restrictions on resolution and framerate.</p>

<p>You can't use the overlay filter as it doesn't output to a pixel format with alpha. So, just the chromakey filter, and no color source.</p>

"ffmpeg- What's the difference between ""NN000/1000 fps"" and ""NN000/1001 fps""?","1565","","<p>I'm trying to select the correct capture options for <code>ffmpeg</code> and I'm confused by this kind of listing:</p>

<pre><code>[decklink @ 00000000010564c0]   17      3840x2160 at 24000/1001 fps

[decklink @ 00000000010564c0]   21      3840x2160 at 30000/1000 fps
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the fact that 24 and 30 have two entries and 25 only has one, I assume that the two 24 options are true 24fps and 23.9fps, and the two 30 options are true 30fps and 29.97fps.</p>

<p>But which is which?  And why is this kind of notation used?</p>
","<p>Yes, <code>24000/1000</code> is 24 fps and <code>24000/1001</code> is 23.976fps. Some refer to the X/1001 frame rates as ""drop down"" (as in ""dropped down from the integer"") but this is easy to confuse with ""pull down"" which often refers to the cadence of frames when fitting 24 or 25 fps material into a 30 fps program.</p>

<p>You can also think of these notations as <code>24,000 divided by 1,000 equals 24</code> and <code>24,000 divided by 1,001 equals 23.976023976 repeating</code>. This notation is also the exact same thing as saying <code>24 divided by 1 equals 24</code> and <code>24 divided by 1.001 equals 23.976023976 repeating</code>. It is, of course, quite ridiculous to articulate the repeating decimal values.</p>

<p>The <code>1001</code> options and their resulting notation are a legacy from analog color television systems. As Mulvya points out ""it's because that's the smallest set of numbers that represent the value as integers"". These standards are still around today mainly for backwards compatibility (with black and white television sets) and 'cause that's just the way TV grew up. Prior to color television, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NTSC</a> frame rate was actually exactly thirty frames per second.</p>

<p>As for the <code>30000/1000</code> and <code>30000/1001</code> notation it comes from the NTSC video standard. ""30""fps NTSC is actually displaying 30/1.001 frames per second (sometimes referred to as ""29.97"" or ""30DF"" for short, but to be precise 29.97002997... repeating frames per second). Due to this slight difference (.01%), NTSC uses either Drop-Frame (DF) or Non Drop-Frame (NDF) time-code counting. Drop-Frame ""drops"" frame counts in a pattern such that every ten minutes the time-code duration will correspond to the actual playback duration. No image frames are dropped and this was mainly a consideration for broadcasters fitting their programs with commercial breaks. Non Drop-Frame on the other hand more accurately represents a count of the total number of frames in a program (for those who enjoy counting in base 24:60:60:30...)</p>

<p>As for <code>25000/1000</code> there's no 25/1.001fps standard because 25fps is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PAL</a> standard and PAL video systems were engineered using 50Hz AC power which did not have the same issues as NTSC when color came about.</p>

<p>Emulating PC speaker with the integrated sound card and listening through the laptop speaker I hear up to 20KHz and it is nothing like a pain.</p>

<p>So I am wondering if any of these two can be trusted for producing frequencies above 8Khz? I'm more inclined to trust the old PC speaker because I expect to hardly be able to hear such high frequencies. Not having experience with known correct equipment it is hard to judge though.</p>

<p>P.S. I don't think there is any spec I can read about frequency response.</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_speaker"" rel=""nofollow"">classic PC Speaker</a> is a very simple system that was designed to be inexpensive and use off-the-shelf parts of the early 1980s.</p>

<p>The core problem is that the PC speaker system consists of a cheap speaker, a timer, and digital pulses. Using this system, you can get quite a lot of interesting sounds out that weren't originally intended. But you are limited to square waves and the harmonic content that comes with them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't think there is any spec I can read about frequency response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best you can find is specs for the timer and then run experiments with the actual hardware. The early IBM PCs had discrete timers, but at some point that functionality got rolled into the VLSI chipsets that PC makers used to build motherboards.</p>

<p>If you have an actual audio chip built into the motherboard (fairly common, these days, much less common even in the late 1990s), then it is likely that the PC speaker functionality is emulated there. So the behavior will be different from the original hardware.</p>

<p>Your integrated sound card should produce the most accurate sound. But at the upper end of the sound range, you may be limited by the physical capabilities of your laptop speakers. If you drive the speaker faster than it can move, then you won't get the sound you expect.</p>

"Split video into equal duration segments","1539","","<p>I am currently using ffmpeg to split videos into <code>10</code> seconds segments. I have taken two approaches but neither seems to yield the desired results. Approach number one is using basic cutting with the -t and -ss options to get the segments. This gives close to accurate segments but  it has some issues with the frames in the ending of some videos. The second option is using segment: great and fast but it gives segments of not equal duration. Any idea how to get segments of the same duration and no issues in the frames? In other words if I play them in a list it should play smoothly</p>

<p>General way</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg – i input.mp4  -ss &lt;start&gt; -t &lt;duration&gt; -vcodec copy -acodec copy output%03d.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Using segment</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -map 0 -segment_time 8 -f segment output%03d.mp4
</code></pre>
","<p>The issue with the frames are very likely the results of using h264 and not re-encoding the video. h264 usually doesn't have single frames (unless encoded with an intra profile) but groups of frames (GOPs), ffmpeg will cut at a keyframe position ie. at the end or beginning of a GOP. Or not in the case of your first approach, giving you issues with the affected GOPs.</p>

<p>The issue should be resolved by re-encoding (-vcodec libx264 -preset slow) or if that also yields errors transcode to a lossless codec like jpeg2000 (<code>-vcodec libopenjpeg</code>) cut your video and then encode into h264 again (or any other codec you may prefer).</p>

"Lossless cutting video (MPEG-4)","1517","","<p>Is it possible to lossless clip out the video file (MPEG-4/H.264) that result chunks will be <em>equivalent</em> to the same of raw footage? I want to reduce size of the source (raw) material by cutting off the unnecessary, but desire to have remaining clips in the same quality as initial video.</p>
","<p>Yes, it is generally possible, but with a few limitations.  h.264 uses what is known as a group of pictures.  A group of pictures groups multiple frames together in a way that allows for further compression, but the entire group of pictures has to be decoded together.  As such, it is only possible to cut a video stream in between groups of pictures. This is often around 15 frames, but length can vary based on encoding options that were used.</p>

<p>As long as you are ok breaking it on a group of pictures, you can cut up the video to your hearts content and still use the same data stream.  At the end of the day, most video formats consist of some metadata that describes how the video is laid out and how it syncs with the audio.  It then contains one or more streams of video and one or more streams of audio.  When played back, this metadata is read and then the streams are used for playback.</p>

<p>Splitting the file simply means extracting part of the stream, broken up on a group of pictures, pulling out the relevant audio and then piecing the data back together in a new container that has metadata that corresponds to it.  As long as you break it at the points it is designed to break, then it ends up being two normal, otherwise unaltered streams.  There are numerous tools that can do this for you, including tools like FFMPEG, though I unfortunately do not have the exact command to perform the split as my FFMPEG skills are decidedly weaker than many others on here (though one of them will likely soon be able to post with the command line you need.)</p>

<p>How can I pragmatically output the format in h.264 (.mp4) instead of it defaulting to (.avi).</p>

<p>I've discovered that you can just change the default output module via edit -> templates -> output module, but still.. is there anyway of doing this via script?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>So, the answer to your question is 'yes, but...'</p>

<p>It's perfectly feasible, but you have to create an output module with the settings that you want, and then save it to your computer.  You can create this by going to Edit -> Templates -> Output Module.  Click on the 'New' button in the pop-up window, and then Edit it for the settings you need (quicktime, h.264, etc).  Save it as a useful name (""H264HighQuality"" or something like that).  Save the output module, and you'll be able to access it from your scripts from there on out.</p>

<p>In order to use it in your script, just use:
<code>app.project.renderQueue.items.add(myComp).applyTemplate(""H264HighQuality"");</code></p>

<p>As long as you've <em>made</em> the template first, you can access it in your scripts as many times as you want.  However, After Effects does NOT allow you to programmatically create Output Modules or alter them on the fly, unfortunately.  But you only need to make the template once -- as long as you have that template on the computer you're running the script, it should work just fine.</p>

"Thunderbolt 3 & eGPU viable for Video Processing?","1504","","<p>I am pondering about getting a (new) notebook at some point. Apparently TB3 (officially) supports external GPU's now. The problem is that the speed of TB3 is still much lower than Pci-x... So I was wondering - and maybe someone knowledgeable can give some insight - if a notebook with TB3 and an eGPU will be a viable solution for video processing with davinci resolve and other gpu accelerated software, or how important is the ""low"" IO speed of TB3 vs PCI in that context?</p>
","<p>I've looked into this recently myself, given that the MBP line is not exactly a workhorse when it comes to GPU processing. </p>

<p>eGPUs are actually being done now over TB2, with great success. I have a friend who purchased a similar unit to the <a href=""https://www.akitio.com/expansion/thunder2-pcie-box"" rel=""nofollow"">Akitio Thunder2</a> (the <a href=""https://bizon-tech.com/us/bizonbox2-egpu.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bizon-Tech</a> version), put a decent GPU in it (I think it was the GTX960 or similar), and experienced almost 50% faster render time in Premiere (the latest versions of CC support GPU acceleration for encode/decode with some codecs). </p>

<p>The math gets a little funky, but actually <a href=""http://www.tested.com/tech/457440-theoretical-vs-actual-bandwidth-pci-express-and-thunderbolt/"" rel=""nofollow"">this Tested article</a> comparing PCI Express to Thunderbolt indicates that the Thunderbolt2 spec, in practice, provides almost the equivalent of a PCIe3.0 interface. The bandwidth speed lost will be minimal. Further, the article indicates that <em>performance</em> of the graphics card that is lost by a slower transfer speed is, for all practical intents and purposes, negligible (as little as 5% in most cases).</p>

<p>I'm certain that the performance gained by an eGPU box, even over TB2 on current-gen hardware, would vastly outstrip the current performance you're getting on a CPU-accellerated-only laptop. </p>

<p>And, the best part is, you're out only around $1500 for a box and a good graphics card.</p>

<p><em>For the record:</em></p>

<p>I don't know what notebook you're using, but I'll assume a relatively recent MBP. I'm working here from a 2014 15"" Retina which happens to have dual GPUs (integrated Intel Iris and discrete GeForce GT 750M), and based strictly on CUDA cores, you'll have to pick up something in the K1200+ range if you want to see a significant improvement (the <a href=""http://gpuboss.com/graphics-card/GeForce-GT-750M"" rel=""nofollow"">GT750M has 384 cores</a>). However, it's relatively weak at only 2GB GDDR5 (roughly comparable to a K620 in terms of cuda cores and memory).</p>

<p>Improving both specs is important, particularly for 4K or RAW video. I would recommend something like a K2200 or K5000, or if you've had a good year, any of the Maxwell-class cards would be a beautiful, beautiful thing.</p>

"How to make a video of an iPad (or other tablet) screen","1496","","<p>I have been making some movies of my iPad for promotional videos and they all range from bad to worse in terms of video quality. I have used compact cameras and camcorders with pretty similar results. </p>

<p>Most of the stuff I shoot is AVCHD 1920x1080 at 30fps. The camera is positioned to take in the whole screen of the iPad and little (or nothing) else.</p>

There is a weird strobey effect (NO idea why that would appear <em>more</em> with this camera shooting 30fps than with any other one), and the clarity is not great. In fact, it may look better with a $250 Sony pocket camera I have.</p>

<li>Should the iPad's brightness be high, medium or low?</li>

<li>Since the DSLR has SO many manual settings, what adjustments should I be trying to make?</li>
<li>Since the DSLR has interchangeable lenses, what kind of lens is really appropriate for this sort of thing?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The room should be dark, so the tablet is the light source.</li>
<li>Experiment with the brightness, but usually low is the way to go.</li>
<li>Camera doesn't need to be extremely close, but the more zoom you use the more obvious vibrations will be.</li>
<li>Put the DSLR in manual focus and adjust it so the tablet is just slightly out of focus - this will remove the moire effect.</li>
<li>You want a short depth of field. This is achieved with a lower F-Stop (larger aperture opening).</li>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To be more clear:<br>
If I record a movie with my cellphone's camera, there is no doubt its quality is not good enough to be projected on a cinema. So I should use a more professional camera! My question is about the minimum characteristics this professional camera should have. Like the number of frames it can record per second, the size of picture it records, the number of pixels per picture it records, etc.</p>
","<p>If I understood your question correctly, you want to project a movie on a cinema.</p>

<p>This would depend on the projector used by the movie theatre. Most movie theatres use film projectors, for which there really isn't a ""quality"", but rather you'd have to worry about getting a decent camera with decent film at the correct size. In this case I don't know much about transferring from digital to film. </p>

<p>If the movie theatre uses a digital projector though, they usually come in 2K (2048×1080) at 24 or 48 frames per second, or 4K (4096×2160) at 24 fps if they follow the DCI specification. Basically, get the best camera you can get. 2K should be enough to have a pretty good quality experience at the distance a cinema projection is seen from.</p>

<p>Also remember though, the quality does not only depend on the amount of pixels on screen, but also on the compression used, and the sensor of the camera itself, so be prepared for large files or a lot of processing to compress your movie to a high quality profile.</p>

<p>If you can't get a 2K camera, 1080p should do: it's not too far from 2k: it the same vertical size, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aVector_Video_Standards2.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">just a little less wide</a>. </p>

","<p>FFmpeg with a lossless codec is one solution. I recall <a href=""http://boredzo.org/codec-comparison/"">a comparison of different codecs</a> which concluded that Apple Animation (known to ffmpeg as <code>qtrle</code>) gave the best quality for screen-recording.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s 1024x768 -i :0.0 -c:v qtrle output.mov

<p>Stop it by opening its terminal while it is running and pressing <code>q</code>. Obviously change the resolution (1024x768 here) to match your own.

<p>It is possible that the <code>ffmpeg</code> which comes with your Linux distribution does not have the <code>qtrle</code> codec included. In this case you have to <a href=""http://www.ffmpeg.org/index.html"">download and compile</a> your own version. </p>

"Opteka CXS-2 vs Glidecam HD-2000","1469","","<p>Recently I have been looking at a lot of reviews of these two video stabilization products and now I simply can't make up my mind - which one is better for me, which one should I buy?</p>

<p>I mean, the Glidecam is amazing, but is it really worth the price? Perhaps Opteka shoulder rig would be enough if I'm filming just camps, public events and such things.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have had a similar experience. Perhaps there's something else that you can suggest for a low-budget starter in DSLR film making?</p>

","<p>I have a glidecam 2000 and a chest harness for it.  I also have a shoulder mount similar to the opteka one you linked.</p>

<p>I use shoulder mount far more then the glidecam.<br>
It takes time and practice to get good at the glidecam.  Lots and lots of time.
After using it with a chest harness I would never use it by itself again.
Without any extra support just the glidecam is exhausting for your arm.  Guess what your arm does when it's tired, it shakes..</p>

<p>The shoulder mount rocks.  I can give that to a rooky camera op and they have very few issues using it.</p>

<p>It's ideal as a mobile shoot.  Unless you have good image stabilization neither can move very fast or far.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind neither can move far or fast, your not going to be running after your actor .</p>

<p>You will also need to shoot with a wide lens that has image stabilization using either of these pieces of gear.</p>

"Orbits in After Effects","1460","","<p>I'm new to After Effects and I might be asking about obvious stuff, but I searched this site and elsewhere and can't find an answer. </p>

<p>Basically I want to orbit some points in a setup similar to the Sun - Earth - Moon (Sun is static, Earth goes around the Sun, and the Moon goes around the Earth), and I need each moving point to have its position change over time so that I can parent other stuff to them.  </p>

<p>I'm trying to animate this graphic:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QPsW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've got the epicycle (the small circle) to rotate around point T (Terre), while V (Venus) is rotating on the epicycle. I have a beam between T and the center of the epicycle (C), but I would also need to add a beam between C and Venus. </p>

<p>I can get Venus to rotate on the epicycle either by making it an ellipse on it's own layer and then parenting it to the epicycle; or I can add it as another ellipse on the same shape layer as the epicycle, making V rotate with the epicycle. But in both cases the position of Venus remains invariable, so the beam can't follow.</p>

<p>How do I make point V rotate on the epicycle such that its own position changes over time allowing me to add a beam between it and the center of the epicycle?</p>

<p>I'm confused by all the different Position parameters, if I create V as an ellipse on its own shape layer there'll be 3 different position parameters and none if them will change over time if V is parented to the epicycle. I've also tried alt-pick-whipping these 3 to the position of the epicycle with no luck. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OjvYK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Ok, it's relatively straightforward using some expressions. But then again isn't everything?</p>

<p>Assuming you've got your original rotating beam layer, your epicycle layer which is parented to the original beam, and your Venus layer parented to that. You need to find the co-ordinates of the center of the Venus layer, relative to the Composition, in order to draw a beam to it. </p>

<p>Well you could work it out trigonometrically I'm sure, but it's way too late and I've been into the Irish Single Malt, so I'm not going to go there. Luckily there's a handy expression that does the job: <code>toComp(point)</code>. What it does is find the composition co-ordinates of a point on a layer. </p>

<p>First we apply a <strong>Point Control</strong> effect <em>Effects>Expression Controls>Point Control</em> to the Venus layer, we'll use the <code>toComp</code> expression to set its value. But before that, make sure the <strong>Anchor Point</strong> property of the Venus layer is showing – we'll need it in a second. </p>

<p>Now to apply an expression to the point control <kbd>alt/opt</kbd>-click the stopwatch on the <strong>Point</strong> property of that effect. In the expressions editor that opens up type <code>toComp(</code> and then drag the expression pick-whip to the <strong>Anchor Point</strong> property to fill in the value <code>Transfrom.AnchorPoint</code>. You can type it, but it's case sensitive and not at all forgiving of typos. Then close the brackets: <code>)</code> it should now read <code>toComp(transform.anchorPoint)</code>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KNJV8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So now you have a point that tells you where exactly the Venus Layer's anchor point is in the comp. Using an expression you could plug this straight into the <strong>End Point</strong> property of the <strong>Beam</strong> effect, but I'm allergic to the beam effect, I prefer to use shape layers, because vectors.</p>

<p>So I make a new rectangular shape layer with the stroke I want, and no fill, and I set all the transforms to 0. The size of the rectangle path is going to be the length between the start of the original beam, and the value of the <strong>Point Control</strong> point, AKA the position of Venus. You can do this by getting the square root of the sum of the squares of the X and Y offsets, but that's a bit 6th century BC, instead we'll use the handy expression <code>length(point1, point2)</code>. And we'll set the height to 0, so that it draws a line.</p>

<p>So on the rectangle shape layer, in the <strong>Contents>Rectangle 1>Rectangle Path 1</strong> Property we'll use this expression:</p>

<pre><code>origin=thisComp.layer(""origin"");
venus=thisComp.layer(""venus"")
beamlength=length(origin.transform.position, venus.effect(""Point Control"")(""Point""));
[beamlength,0]
</code></pre>

<p>layer <em>origin</em> is the original beam. You could do it all on one line, but it would be hella ugly:</p>

<pre><code>[length(thisComp.layer(""origin"").transform.position,thisComp.layer(""venus"").effect(""Point Control"")(""Point"")),0]
</code></pre>

<p>Beauty is truth. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hEReD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since by default the rectangle tool draws rectangles around a central point we need to offset it. In the <strong>Contents>Rectangle 1>Rectangle Path 1>Position</strong> Property (not the layer's position property, that should be the same as the original beam, or the shape's <strong>Contents>Rectangle 1>Transform: Rectangle 1>position</strong> property, that should be 0,0) we offset it by half the width, so that the rectangle's left edge is always at the origin, thus : <code>content(""Rectangle 1"").content(""Rectangle Path 1"").size/2</code> (did you notice that we're dividing a vector by a scalar? 100 Nerd points to you if you did.)</p>

<p>Now we've got a beam that is the right length, but we need to rotate it. Thank you and good night Pythagoras, hello Mr Aryabhata. Since we know the rise and the run, we can find the angle using Atan(rise/run). But there's some problems: when the run is negative Atan will return a positive value, and whenever the run is 0 the expression will crash. And lastly <code>Math.atan</code> returns a result in Radians, so we need to convert it to degrees. So we have to turn a relatively simple expression into this monster, which goes on the <strong>Contents>Rectangle 1>Transform: Rectangle 1>Rotation</strong> Property:</p>

<pre><code>s=thisComp.layer(""venus"").effect(""Point Control"")(""Point"");
o=thisComp.layer(""origin"").transform.position;
run=s[0]-o[0];
rise=s[1]-o[1];   
if (run==0){
 if (rise&gt;0) //pointing straight up
  {-90;}
 else //pointing straight down
  {90;}
} else{
 if (run&gt;0){
    radiansToDegrees(Math.atan(rise/run));
  } else {
    180+radiansToDegrees(Math.atan(rise/run));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this is how my beam layer looks:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SiWGv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and below is the whole comp. I've used shape layers for everything and driven them all by expressions as is my wont, if you want to have a look at it, it's <a href=""http://adobe.ly/1xy8D30"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

"How do you play a clip backwards in Sony Vegas?","1457","","<p>While editing some vocals the other day, I accidentally hit a key in Vegas and the scrub head started going backwards, playing my audio in reverse. I wasn't trying to do this at the time and got it playing normal again. Today I was thinking that this could be useful when trying to find a point where the vocalist takes a breath. Rather than guess, split the clip and play from a few seconds earlier to hear if it is gone, then repeat the process, you could just set the play head past the breath, play it backwards and find the exact point that they start their breath.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the key you hit to play the scrub head backwards in Sony Vegas?</p>

<p>(This is not flipping the clip to play in reverse using ""Right-click/Reverse"", I don't need that, I just need the play head to play in reverse temporarily, like scrubbing it backwards)</p>
","<p>Found it!</p>

<p>You can press the ""J"" key to play in reverse. Each time you hit the ""J"" it will jump a full speed up to x4. If you want to jump by speeds of .25x, hold the ""K"" button and hit ""J"". While it is play backwards, hitting the spacebar will jump you back to where you started playing, and hitting ""K"" will stop you where you are.</p>

<p>To adjust playback speeds going forward, you can use the ""L"" key in the same manor.</p>

<p>To find the exact point where a breath is taken, you place the play head about where the breath starts, then hit ""J"", it will play backwards for a bit. Hit the spacebar and adjust the playback spot by hitting the left or right arrow, then hit ""J"" again. Once you are exactly where you want to cut the clip, hit ""S"" and you will split the clip right there. </p>

<p>(The arrows will jump one ""frame"" according to the frame rate of your project, even if it is an audio project. If it is set to 24 fps, it will jump 1/24th of a second forward or backward)</p>

"How can I create the blurring effect in a video like this?","1450","","<p>I am noticing more and more product videos being released using lots of blur and the focus shifting from one point to another.</p>

<p>I am noob when it comes to video editing, so I want to ask what are the producers of this video most likely using, and how are they doing it?</p>

<p>Sorry if this question seems a bit open ended, but I just want to ask, what techniques have been apparently used on this video to make it what it is.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>There are no filters applied there.  It's pretty much basic shots, probably from a DSLR based on the feel of the video.  The shots with the one guy were shot with things overexposed and then they upped the contrast to try and do recovery, but it results in large overblown highlights where there was too much light to fit in the dynamic range (the amount of variation between brightest and darkest spot) that the camera could capture.  It otherwise all looks like standard footage though, nothing special done other than basic color grading.</p>

<p>Note that if you are talking about the shifting blur effect, that's called rack focus and is so apparent because of the use of a fast lens with a short depth of field.  It looks remarkably similar to footage I get with my 5D Mark iii and 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens.</p>

<p>Rack Focus can either be from out of focus completely to focus on a particular subject or from one subject to another. It generally uses a narrow depth of field and a follow focus may be used to help reach the focus points exactly and in a controlled manner.</p>

<p>The technique is often used either to introduce a subject from a dream or stunned like state (for example, if someone is waking up or in an accident, their pov might start out with a rack focus from being completely out of focus). It is also very frequently used to shift the viewer's focus from one subject to another in a dramatic way. In the more artistic sense, it can also be used to simply explore the depth of the scene by moving the viewer through the space.</p>

"Waving flag in After Effects from vector","1442","","<p>Could anyone provide some insight on how to go about animating a vector flag (such as the one pictured below) to wave in the wind.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xd18b.gif"" alt=""Waving flag""></p>
","<p>The simplest way would be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Create your flag in Illustrator</li>
<li>Think about or simply test how many frames/steps are key for animation</li>
<li>Draw your <em>frames/steps</em> on seperate Illustrator layers in to get the same position for all of it</li>
<li>Paste your <em>frame/path</em> with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> on <strong>1 solid layer</strong> every 4-20 frames by switching between After Effects and Illustrator back and forth - time depends on your animation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Through pasting the masks at a different time, After Effects automatically creates keyframes of the mask shape property. All copied shapes become interpolated keyframes like a roto shape animation to get soft transitions. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The only limitation is that the number of anchor points <em>per vector image</em> should remains the same to get soft interpolation between the <em>shape keys</em>.</p>

"How can I make a video more seekable?","1429","","<p>I am looking at the factor that allows software video players to seek at any (or close to) position in the video.</p>

<p>Is this the keyframes or what? </p>
","<p>The problems with seeking are typically in the video player and not in the videos themselves, so you may want to look at different video player. A video player should be able to seek to any frame in the video, regardless of format and the encoder settings used. It is also technically possible to play any video backwards, even though very few players support this.</p>

<p>The problem is, seeking into frames that are not keyframes is difficult and CPU intensive. Frames that are encoded as keyframes can be decoded on their own, while non-keyframes depend on other frames to be decoded. If you are playing the movie left to right all the dependencies  for a given frame have been already decoded, but if you are seeking directly into the frame, then the player needs to search for all those dependencies, decode them and only then it can decode the target frame.</p>

<p>So I think I can summarize my advice as two different suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Switch to a player that can seek to any frame.</p></li>
<li><p>if you can't switch to a better player, then encoding your video with more frequent keyframes will give you better seek accuracy, at the expense of picture quality (if you keep the bitrate the same) or file size (if you increase the bitrate to compensate).</p></li>
</ol>

"How to time-remap with Twixtor in Adobe Premiere?","1409","","<p>I have problem to understand, how Twixtor works. </p>

<p>I want to use Twixtor plugin with my Adobe Premiere Pro. I can only change speed for whole sequence. Adobe has its own filter called ""Time remapping"", but that does not change speed so smoothly, as I saw in some videos.</p>

<p>Does Twixtor have keyframes? Where I can set start and end of slow down effect?</p>
","<p>Just like with any effect property you can animate it by clicking on the little stop watch on the left of the effect property name (see below).</p>

<p>You can apply the effect to just a single clip, you don't have to use it on the entire sequence, just drag and drop the effect from the effect list onto the desired clip and then animate the speed of the video via keyframes.</p>

"After Effects CC slant effect crops artwork","1408","","<p>I'm a newbie to AE so there's probably a simple answer to this. So I've imported some art from illustrator and dropped in on the stage. I then <code>Create shapes from vector layer</code>. Then I apply the effect <code>CC Slant</code> under the Distort menu under Effects and give the slant a value of 50.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5RVMl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Looking good. Until I move it to the edge of the stage and then the artwork gets cropped. Notice how only the ""mple"" of ""Example"" are visible:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NV8z2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Even after rendering the movie (with the position changing from center stage to left stage while slanted), the problem persists. I have tried re-importing my artwork, and applying the slant effect while the artwork is in different positions on the stage to no avail. I've also tried other effects like the warp effect, and the same thing happens. </p>

<p>Is there a way to keep the artwork from getting cropped on the edge of the stage?</p>
","<p>Depending on how you imported it, it is possible that it ended up nested as a nested composition or smart object.  If you applied the effect to the outer object but then dragged it within the inner object, you could end up dragging it off the edge of the outer object which would produce the result you are experiencing.</p>

<p>Effectively, you would have an outer object that is tilted and an inner object that is going off the edge of the outer.  Thus, the outer object displays only the half of the object you see and then the skew gets applied (which makes the otherwise vertical clipping to be angled.)</p>

<p>That's the only thing that occurs to me as a possible cause.</p>

<p>Even if that isn't it, a work around might be to put the original graphic in a composition and then apply the effect to the composition instead and then move the composition as you need.  This would probably work around whatever issue you are having here.</p>

"Which decoder allows for fast seeking or how to configure k-lite codec pack?","1400","","<p>I am using mostly Haaly Media Splitter for input and ffdshow for decoding (libavcodec).
Actually I am ok with the default profile 7 installation of k-lite codec pack.</p>

<p>At the moment I have the default options in the ffdshow decoder configuration and in the Haali media splitter filter.</p>

<p>What I want is to make seeking as fast as possible. Any suggestions on how to detect the bottleneck or how to reduce seeking time?</p>
","<p>Let me describe what the bottleneck in seeking is.</p>

<p>You didn't say what format are your videos encoded in, but I'm guessing you are using H.264 or maybe MPEG-2. Am I correct?</p>

<p>To maximize quality, these codecs have different compression formats, and each frame gets encoded differently. This is a brief summary of the compression types:</p>

<ul>
<li>I-frames (I stands for intracoded) are frames that can be decoded easily, as they don't depend on any other frames.</li>
<li>P-frames (P stands for predictive) are frames that encode only the differences from one or more previous I or P-frames. To decode a P-frame you need to first decode all the I and P-frames that this frame depends on.</li>
<li>B-frames (B stands for bi-directional) are frames that encode differences like P-frames, but unlike P-frames, these differences can refer to previous or future I or P-frames. As with P-frames, To decode a B-frame you first need to decode all the past and future frames that are dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>So now I hope the performance problem with seeking is clear. You jump to the middle of the movie clip, and chances are, you are going to land on a B or a P-frame. So the decoder now needs to find all the references required by that frame, decode them in the correct order and only then it can finally decode the target frame.</p>

<p>To achieve better compression and higher quality, encoders create a lot less I-frames than P or B-frames. The idea is that the compressed stream starts with a really high quality I-frame, and then for a number of frames that follow, smaller P and B frames encode just the differences. Of course if you go for a long time like this quality starts to degrade, so at some point the movie will include another big and nice I-frame and the cycle starts again.</p>

<p>When a movie clip is played from start to end, the different frame types appear sorted in the file so that when playback reaches a given frame, all its references have already been seen by the decoder. This allows for very efficient playback at 1x speed. Unfortunately when you play at other rates or when you seek the amount of work the decoder needs to do to find referenced frames is much larger because frames are read out of sequence.</p>

<p>So going back to your question, the problem isn't really in the decoder. If you need to improve seek time you need to use videos that are encoded to minimize seek time. In essence this means videos that have more frequent I-frames, also called keyframes sometimes. The more I-frames you have, the less references will be required to decode P and B-frames so the decoder will have less work to seek.</p>

<p>I hope this helped understand the problem.</p>

"How do I mute my monitors while leaving headphones on?","1389","","<p>Very simply, I want to be able disable my monitor speakers and leave the headphones on.  This is obviously important when recording in the same room.</p>

<p>All of the mixers I have come across place the main level controls before the phones output, which have their own level control.  This seems like a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>Sounds simple enough, but <a href=""http://www.homerecordingconnection.com/forum.php?action=view_thread&amp;id=17303&amp;frm=8"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a>, which is the closest I've found to a statement of the question, never addresses it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Biggest thing I am not sure how to do is set up my
  monitors/headphones on the mixer so that I can go back and forth when
  recording</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Up to now, I have been driving my monitors from the 1&amp;2 bus of a mixing console.  This allows me to turn down the speakers using the group faders.  But this console is broken, and I would like to replace it with something simpler that is strictly for monitoring (since I don't need the preamps or EQ, etc.)  It seems like a simple line mixer should be able to handle my requirements.  But even the line mixers with 2 aux buses don't have single faders for those sends.</p>

<p>What am I missing here?  How is this normally done?</p>
","<p>you are in the correct track: a small mixer would do the trick. Basically you have the pfl button that would get the specific channel(s)/souce(s) selected to your headhones jack (monitors) without modifying at all your master (and viceversa). Another option would be something like the Mackie Big Knob, made specifically for what you want, but in this case you can only select to monitor a source, not individual channels).</p>

This <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q311TravelZoomGroupTest/page9.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> shows some candidates which IMO give pretty good competition to modern camcorders.
I already have a decent SLR camera for taking still pictures, and now i am interested in buying a camera for shooting home videos. I thought of buying a digital camera instead of a  camcorders - but only if I will not be missing out anything that only camcorders have to offer.</p>
","<p><strong>The video capabilities of even the best digital cameras are but a small fraction of these of video cameras.</strong> The gap is smaller now but only marginally so.</p>

<p>Where <strong>digital cameras compare very well is in terms of image quality</strong>, particularly when it comes to low light shooting. For almost everything else, video cameras trump digital cameras.</p>

<p><strong>Camcorders have sophisticated and detailed control over audio recording.</strong> They can set levels and recording angle which almost no digital camera can do. You can plug an external audio source on some still cameras but that is about it.</p>

<p><strong>The optical zoom of camcorders is specially designed for video.</strong> It moves silently and smoothly to give a natural look. Camcorder lenses are built with a continuous variable apertures so that the brightness of images can vary smoothly rather than in steps (only a handfull of SLD lenses can do that). The focus system works equally smoothly and quietly while most digital cameras record AF noise in the audio track.</p>

<p><strong>Camcorders have tons of features which are meaningful to video.</strong> Fading, transitions and even video effects are the norm. They can also record for much longer both continuously and in sequence than still cameras. You can get up to a 128GB SDXC card for a still camera but it is costly while a camcorder can easily have a 200GB HDD built in.</p>

At 48kHz, I understand that it is easier to construct a lowpass filter with a bit of higher bandwidth to remove aliasing, but I don't understand why anybody would want to record at 96kHz.  </p>

<p>For projects which are strictly digital, ie, using pure digital synthesis and not recording any material which would be converted from analog -> digital, is there any advantage to using sampling rates above 44.1kHz?</p>

<p>For everything else, is there any benefit at all to using 96kHz?  Is it beneficial when applying some particular type of DSP operation later on?  Or is it purely a placebo effect for the ear?</p>

<p>Note: There are other questions here asking about which sampling rates to use for various types of recording projects, but here I am asking for <em>real, hard facts</em> for any mathematical or DSP-related reasons supporting use of higher sampling rates.</p>
","<p>I always use double sampling rates if possible, for two important reasons.</p>

<p>First reason: to get rid of the characteristics of the anti-imaging filter when working with analog sound sources. What is an anti-imaging filter?</p>

<p>Let's say I am recording on 44100 Hz.<br>
If I would record a sine wave of less then 10 KHz, you could clearly see the sinewave when you plot the sample values in a graph.<br>
If I sample a sine wave of 0dB FS with a 22,5KHz frequency, the samples read 1 and -1 alternately.</p>

<p>Now, here's the problem. If I record a sine wave of 0dB FS with a 30 KHz frequency, and plot the samples, each sample is taking more than half a sine period, and - if you would play back the samples - it would return an 11KHz sinewave. (If you don't believe me, just make a simple drawing.) This behaviour is called the 'imaging effect'.</p>

<p>This means that before sampling the signal, we have to be sure that there are NO frequencies present what so ever above the so-called ""nyquist frequency"" (which is half the sampling rate). When using digital sound sources that provide their sounds already sampled, this is not really that big a deal, since they can sometimes just be programmed to never generate a signal above half the sampling rate, or they can filter everything out using a linear-phase brickwall filter that has no effect on the rest. </p>

<p>But, if you are sampling signal from an analog source, this filtering is done before the signal is sampled. The only way to filter analog sound is by use of an electronical circuit. And since the filter is supposed to have a very steep curve, <strong><em>it will affect the frequencies within the audible range</em></strong>, even though the filter was not designed for it. Now there are quite some good filters inside A/D converters, so the problem is minimal, but it gets relatively irritating to listen to when you are working several days on 44.1 KHz audio, compared to using 96KHz. The filter that is going to be applied when you downsample 96 back to 44.1 is of course a digital filter, and is probably of a much better quality. And, it is only applied when you are completely done with all the work, so it won't bother you.</p>

<p>Second reason: to get rid of the characteristics of the dithering signal. </p>

<p>When you are recording in 24 bits resolution and you plan to have your master at 16 bits, you will need a dithering signal to mask away the rounding errors. Now noise is not a pretty thing to have in your recording and while broadband noise is best for masking rounding errors, noise shaping can be a big improvement applied to the dithering signal in order to make it less disturbing. Now if the recording was made using 96KHz, you can noise shape most of the dithering signal to frequencies higher than 24KHz, so nobody will hear them. The dithering noise is at the end of the recording finally filtered out, at the moment you downsample your project back to 44.1 KHz.</p>

<p>So, bottom lines:
Is it useful when recording analog stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, definitely. You have less disturbance from the anti-imaging filter and less disturbance from the dithering signal when used with proper noise shaping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it useful when working with digital stuff that came right of my softsynth?</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, still useful if you plan to work with 24 bits, and mastering it down to 16 bits. You can gain a great deal with noise shaping the dithering signal.</li>
</ul>

"Motion and shape tracking in After Effects CS5.5","1334","","<p>My footage consists of someone with black sunglasses moving his head tilting slowly back and forth. The glass of the sunglasses is visible in the footage. In the beginning the head is tilted back, the glasses are turned up from the camera, so only a small portion of the glass is visible. The more the head tilts forward, the more the glass approaches being parallel to the camera.</p>

<p>I want to track the shape and movement of the glass. So the movement would be saved to the position/rotation path and the shape to a mask shape. I have tried this using After Effects, but I only managed to track the motion of the area movement.<br>
How do I track the changing shape of the glass as well?  I also have access to Mocha and Boujou.</p>

"What's the difference between an Engineer and a Producer?","1324","","<p>People seem to be making a point of the distinction of the role of Engineer and Producer. What's the difference?</p>
","<p>The engineer is the ""equipment operator"".  His expertise is choosing the right equipment for the job and using it in the right way to achieve the desired effect.  His role is analogous to that of the cameraman in film production.</p>

<p>The producer is kind of like a project manager.  His job is to get all the individuals - musicians, vocalists, engineers - to each do their part to achieve the overall goal.<br>
For example, he might decide a certain song should be quiet and soothing, so he'll advise the musicians to tone down the accompaniment, the vocalist to soften her voice, and the engineer to add the necessary processing to achieve that soothing sound he's after.</p>

"Does HD necessarily mean clear, high quality images?","1323","","<p>I recently purchase an <a href=""http://www.axis.com/products/cam_m5014/"" rel=""nofollow"">AXIS network camera</a> that will be used at a scrap metal yard to photograph truck license plates. While the camera is probably sufficient for my purposes I was a bit confused because it was advertised as an HDTV 720p camera but the image quality (still or video) is nowhere near as good as, say, any of the leading smartphone cameras. Apparently, this is because each image is only around 1 MP. If the image is aliased and blurry, in what sense is it ""high definition""? It has ""more lines"" than my old TV, yet it looks worse than any other digital camera I've owned in the last 10 years. Isn't this term a bit misleading in this context?  </p>
","<p>HD simply refers to a given number of pixels in the signal, not some measure of quality.  Even 1080p TV is lower resolution than the photos on most camera phones.  Even the 4k video used in the latest Hollywood blockbuster movies is lower quality than the still photos of most camera phones.  Video takes up far FAR more data than stills.  If you think about it, 1 second of video contains between 24 and 60 individual photos depending on the format of video being used.  Now there are ways to shrink the video since a lot of the pictures are very similar, but the quality that can be recorded is still much smaller than what we can process for a still.</p>

<p>The think is that an 8mp camera phone still doesn't shoot any better than 1080p video at most, so while it may take 8mp stills, it only takes sub 2mega pixel video.  720p isn't all that much better than an old 480 display.  The main advantage is the progressive scan, but there still isn't that much more information (about double).</p>

<p>The other thing to note with security cameras is that they tend to be made to be durable more than high quality.  The optics are probably not that great and they favor infinity focus over sharpness.  They want everything in the scene to be reasonably in-focus instead of having any particular area really sharp.  So between the optics, the design goals and the limited resolution, it isn't all that surprising that it doesn't render things that clearly since it isn't the goal of a typical security camera.</p>

<p>The term is not at all misleading though and based on your description, it sounds like it behaves like I would expect for the device.  It is High Definition since 720p is a high definition standard even if the optics don't give you as sharp of an image as you'd prefer.</p>

"Stretch or Change Timing in After Effects","1317","","<p>I am new to After Effects. I downloaded the free file for the Month of May from VideoHive and have been playing with it. Some of the text is displayed just a bit too short for my linking. I do not want to change the look of the effects but take everything and make it a half second to one second longer. Basically take the length from 35 seconds to about 55-60 seconds without messing up any of the transitions or effects.  </p>

<p>Is this possible? </p>
","<p>The solution will be found in the Timeline. Scroll through the items in the timeline until you find the track for the text object you want to change. The duration of the text on screen is defined by starting and ending keyframes on the object's track.  </p>

<p>Moving the last keyframe on the object's timeline will extend the duration of an object, so clicking and dragging the last keyframe for the text will extend how long it is on screen. </p>

Currently I am using several <code>Panasonic HS-900k</code>s connected to a PC desktop via RCA cables and several <code>Easycap DC60+</code>s (USB 2.0).

","<p>For amateur events, SDI may be overkill compared to using simple Component.  The key for long runs is to separate the various components so that they don't degrade.

"How to import youtube video into premiere cs4","1297","","<p>I installed adobe premiere cs4 and was really astonished by the fact that it's not possible to import a video downloaded from YouTube, but it is needed to convert it firstly. This application is weight about 3GB on my hard disk and now I must search for a plugin to import a video from YT.</p>

<p>It would be perfectly if i could download a video directly into premiere, and also upload finished file up to youtube.</p>

<p>The only result of my search is a paid plugin named moyea-importer - USD 70<br>
Is there any free plugin for this task. Or any similar solution.<br>
If not - in which format should I download youtube video, in which format should I convert it (what is the best converter for that) to make it editable in premiere.<br>
Working on win xp sp3.<br>
Thanks.</p>
","<p>It's not really all that astonishing.  Youtube is a streaming media service and Premiere is a video editing suite designed to work with files on your local computer.  It isn't part of the function of Premiere to deal with streaming media or convert from a stream to a file or to stream content (though it can produce stream ready files).</p>

<p>To use a video from Youtube, you would first need to use a Youtube stream ripper that will save it out as an actual video file which Premiere should then have no problem opening.  When you finish your project, you would then export to a Youtube compatible format and upload the file to Youtube.  Adobe Media Encoder (which can be used for doing the rendering out of Premiere) actually has presets specifically for Youtube.</p>

"Saving disk space, but not quality","1297","","<p>I'm pretty new at this...  I captured my analog 8mm video tapes in .avi, planning to edit them with Premier.  But I need to make space in my external hard drive.  I have the Adobe Encoder, but I'm afraid I will loose quality in my videos if I use it!  Also, I see it will change my captured videos from .avi to .mp4.
My idea is to keep these external hard drives as a ""master"".<br>
Should I use the Encoder to save space, or to get extra hard drives and leave it that way?
Thanks a lot!!!</p>
","<p>There isn't a perfect answer to this problem.  AVI and MP4 are just container's for video streams, so without knowing more about the actual streams in the containers, it is impossible to tell how much quality loss there would be, but as a general rule of thumb, it isn't all that atypical for AVI to use far less efficient video compression algorithms than MP4 on average.  That doesn't always hold true, but it often is.</p>

<p>That said, what you plan to do with the files also matters.  If these are a master intended for being a high quality copy you can come back and WATCH, then running a high quality h.264 encoding isn't such a bad thing.  You should likely be able to find a setting that will make the files quite a bit smaller and still be pretty high quality to watch.</p>

<p>The problem with this, however, is that while the compression may work well for watching the video, it doesn't work so well for editing and re-encoding the video later.  If you compress too much, the video will look great to a viewer now, but may look like crap after editing and re-encoding a final video later.  If you plan to edit the videos later, you will need to stick to a much higher file size and higher quality encoding.  This could still be h.264, or any of a number of other formats, but it would need to be a much larger file (such as all I frame h.264).</p>

<p>Personally, I've always elected to keep my masters at their highest available capture resolution and fairly minimally compressed, but I also am in a financial situation where buying large amounts of external storage is not a problem.  (I personally have around 20 TB worth of storage, of which about 14TB is full, though some of that is providing redundancy.  That's primarily for video projects, photo projects and Steam downloads.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, it is a personal decision about the trade offs between cost and quality.  Every option has it's costs and only you can decide which costs are best for you.  I'd encourage you to buy more storage if you want to do editing with the videos later, but if you are only worried about playback, I'd recommend encoding it down to a quality that you find high enough by trial and error.  (Also, be sure to check the videos as the level of activity in a video will greatly impact the video quality unless you are using a quality based encoder.)</p>

"Adobe After Effects Frame-By-Frame Editing","1286","","<p>I am currently editing a clip in After Effects. We had a very limited supply of green screen so I am now having to edit some of the white wall too. The thing is, the actors move around, not allowing me to clip out these parts.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there was a thing in After Effects that allowed me to break up the clips so that I can work around the actors in certain time intervals and get the white wall to be transparent.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I hope I understand this correctly, are you saying that you have actors in front of a green screen and sometimes they are off the screen? If you want to chroma key the green screen to be another surface you have to have it consistent all the way through. Green screen is hard enough to get right. (Green or blue screen backgrounds have to be evenly lit with a flat diffused light, non-reflective, and no shadows, otherwise the green screen will look blotchy,
and have noise areas that you can't just tweak out.)</p>

<p>Trying to mask out where your actors fall out of the green screen frame does not have a solution in it. If you didn't get this right in production you won't be able to fix this in post. At least not fix it in post with anything that looks close to natural. I highly recommend you shoot this over.</p>

"In Premiere, is there an easy to way to extract sequences into new projects?","1284","","<p>I started a Premiere project that eventually spawned multiple videos.  Each of those videos is in its own sequence.  I'd like to extract them into their own projects, both to clear out the project manager and leave it more organized, but also so I can ""Clean"" the Media Cache (I don't expect to re-open these sub-projects anytime soon).</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to move the sequences (and associated assets) into new projects?</p>
","<p>There are two ways to do this; since they both have their merits, I'll include both of them.</p>

<h2>1. The Project Manager</h2>

<p>Open <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Project Manager</strong>. It's pretty straightforward, just select the sequences you want to export. If you want to clean up the preview files, uncheck <strong>Include Preview Files</strong>. Select the target directory and click ok. Repeat this for every sequence you want to export to an individual project. The problem with that approach is that <strong>this will also copy your media assets</strong> to the new project's directory, which you might not want.</p>

<h2>2. Importing sequences</h2>

<p>Another option is to import sequences from other Premiere project.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a <strong>new project</strong> in Premiere.</li>
<li>Select <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Import...</strong>. In the pop-up window, select your old project file that has all the sequences in it.</li>
<li>Another dialogue window will pop up asking you whether you want to import the entire project or individual sequences. Select <strong>Import Selected Sequences</strong>.</li>
<li>This will open another window where you can browse your old project and <strong>select the sequence(s) you want</strong> (to select multiple sequences, hold <kbd>CTRL</kbd> / <kbd>CMD</kbd> while selecting them).</li>
</ol>

<p>This will <strong>not copy or move your media assets to a new directory</strong>. Instead it will just import the selected sequence(s) and all media assets it contains into your new project. This however will not import any assets that aren't used in your imported sequence(s). So if you're still working on one of the imported sequences in the new project and want to add clips you had already imported in the old project but hadn't used yet, you'll have to import those manually. To prevent that, import all media assets that are relevant to the sequence into your new project <em>before</em> importing the sequence and make sure <strong>Allow importing duplicate media</strong> is unchecked in the import dialogue.</p>

"Wirecast recording lagging from a video file source","1281","","<p>I have a recorded video in HD format with the source file being about 2GB for 30 minutes of footage. I added it as a new Video Shot in WireCast intending to edit it, however, I got two problems. First, the quality drop tremendously regardless of what kind of output options I use and second, the output video is lagging and that is of course recorded in the final version.</p>

<p>I first tried to compress the video to reduce its size and I got it down to about 300MB but the results where exactly the same.</p>

<p>I then tried to stream the video from another computer on the same network using Desktop Presenter to reduce the load on the one where Wirecast was actually working, however, I got exactly the same results, if not worse.</p>

<p>Any tips on how I can deal with this issue?</p>
","<p>It sounds like your input is too compressed.  Your current quality level is already below what Netflix uses for their full quality HD streaming and is right around Youtube's recommended settings for final output of video.</p>

<p>The problem is, this is already a very highly compressed level.  Both compressing and decompressing an h.264 file take a lot of processing power.  The more compressed the video, the more processing power it takes.</p>

<p>Since the file starts highly compressed, your CPU has to work hard to decode the video and then has to try to re-compress it for the stream.  If it can't keep up with the frame rate, then you start getting quality drop and lag as it does it's best to keep up with the stream.</p>

<p>Further compressing the source video just amplified this problem, though if you have already pre-recorded the video, why not edit it offline and then export the video so that you can stream it without having to re-encode on the fly?</p>

<p>Wirecast isn't designed for editing, it is designed for streaming.</p>

","<p>Depending on your definition of high quality, this is impossible.  For comparison sake, DV video (at standard definition) takes a gigabyte per 4.7 minutes, which is at a good, high quality level of compression.  You are trying to do 60fps 1080p video and get it under 2GB for 4 minutes.  That's over 12 times the information and you are trying to fit it in just over twice the space.</p>

<p>If you want to see how it works out when you use the highest possible quality that will fit your size requirements, you can simply calculate the data rate. Create a 2-pass VBR encoding with an average data rate determined by the size and time.  The file size is equal to the data rate times the number of seconds in the video.  2 pass VBR will ensure that the best possible use is made of that space.</p>

<p>You mention that you can break it up in to 4 minute sections to send over.  Why is it that you can't split the files (using file tools rather than video tools) and have them reassembled on the other side?  Is it a file size limitation or a file transfer limitation?  Also, is there a reason you can't send the original files along with the project files?  Each additional time that you encode, there is a slight bit of quality loss, so it is preferable to work from the original assets whenever possible.</p>

<p>Another possibility if you are working collaboratively and have issues with moving a huge amount of data.  It is possible to output low quality copies of the original video files and substitute those files for the high quality versions when working on them remotely.  Your friend would take your project files and the low quality assets, do any editing he wants, and then send the project files back to you.  You could then render the final output based on your friend's editing decisions but using the original, full quality assets.</p>

<p>The reason you don't want to go to a smaller file size in-between is that each time you encode a video, quality is lost.  The lower quality the source you are working from, the more is lost in each additional encoding, so if you move to a mid-range format early on, then the final output will suffer.  If you run the render from the originals however, you get maximum quality.</p>

","<p>There are a few possibilities.  MP4 is a container format and can contain more than just audio and video streams.  While not all necessarily supported by MP4 specifically, container formats can contain things like sub-titles, sync data, chapter markers, meta-data, etc.  They can also potentially contain more than one audio or video stream.</p>

<p>From the level of detail provided, it isn't really possible to tell exactly what is taking the extra space, it may just be overhead of the format itself or it could be some additional data stream that is stored within the container.</p>

"How are video and audio streams placed in 'container' files and what interrelations do they have?","1255","","<p>So far I have been guessing my way through the types of audio/video streams and getting them mixed up with containers. For example, I have had a friend tell me that a video file which won't play on my TV will work if I can change the file extension to <code>.avi</code>/<code>.mpg</code> for example - which worked. However, when I have had the problem since, I have tried the same but with no luck.</p>

<p>Could someone explain which are containers and how you can have different types of audio/video files/steams within a container file?</p>
","<p>The basics of that are actually not that complicated (while there is definitely more to know about that topic than would fit in this answer).</p>

<p>Take a look at that graphic you can find on the <a href=""http://w3.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">w3c-website</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAdMw.png"" alt=""Containers and file formats graphic""></p>

<p>As you can see, the container is exactly that: a container that can contain different types of media, most notably video and audio, but also captions and metadata about the file. When you speak about a ""file format"", you're normally talking about the container format, after which the file extension for normal video files is named. This is why you've probably seen many video files with file extensions such as <code>.avi</code>, <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mkv</code> and the likes.</p>

<p>When you look at the contents of this container, you will normally have at least one video and one audio track, those are referred to as ""streams"". Streams can be encoded using different codecs. A codec is, in layman's terms, an algorithm (or rather a set of algorithms) which is used to compress a (video or audio) stream. The more efficient the codec, the better the ratio of (video/audio) quality to file size. Two very common codecs are the H.264 (MPEG-4/AVC) codec for video and the AAC codec for audio. Those are popular because they are very efficient, thus you can have very small files with (relatively) good quality.</p>

<p>So to sum this up, the container is some sort of ""wrapper"" that contains the actual media streams. Different container formats allow for different kinds of streams. For example, the <code>.avi</code>-container is very limited, you can only have one audio stream and one video stream. The <a href=""http://www.matroska.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">matroska-container</a> (<code>.mkv</code> files) is a good alternative if you need more than that. Matroska is a very flexible container that allows for multiple audio streams (e.g. for different languages), subtitles and more. However, many devices (e.g. most TVs with a USB port) don't support that standard. This is where the <code>.mp4</code>-container (MP4 being the standard-container for the <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MPEG-4-standard</a>, which is a huge topic on it's own) comes in handy, because nearly all devices can playback files that use this container format along with the H264 &amp; AAC codecs. This combination is the most common approach for easily interchangable video files, which for example is used by most video hosting platforms such as Youtube.</p>

<p>Changing the file extension is generally a stupid idea. If you change an <code>.avi</code> file to something like <code>.mp4</code>, it might work on your TV in some instances, but that is just because your TV is stupid (i.e. it knows the codecs of the streams, but doesn't even try to play them if it doesn't recognise the file extension or something like that). Container format's don't behave like text-files, you can't just change the extension and expect the container format to somehow magically change as well. If you can't open a specific video file, use the <a href=""http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VLC video player</a>, it supports most commonly used file formats and codecs. If you want/need to watch it on a specific device such as your TV which doesn't support the codec, you can re-encode it (not a good idea, because that means quality loss) or remux it, i.e. take the individual streams and put them in different containers (which is a bit more complicated but yields better results).</p>

You didn't specify the exact 3d format you have. There are several possibilities as documented at the the stereo3d link above. Assuming that <code>input.mkv</code> is the relatively common sbsl (side-by-side left eye on left), </p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf stereo3d=sbsl:ml -metadata:s:v:0 stereo_mode=""mono"" output.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>will result in a 2d (left eye only) <code>output.mkv</code>. I believe the reason <code>-metadata:s:v:0 stereo_mode=""mono""</code> is required to remove the stereo tag is because the metadata isn't piped through the filter system, and ffmpeg otherwise tries to duplicate the metadata of the original. If you don't do this, some players may think your 2d result is still 3d and do weird things. </p>

<p>If you find that the result has the wrong aspect ratio, you can experiment with using <code>stereo3d=sbsl2:ml</code> instead which treats the input as half width side-by-side. If all else fails, you can set the correct aspect with <code>-aspect 16:9</code> (or whatever you know the correct aspect ratio to be).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many movies are shot handheld: it is barely noticeable, but in most scenes when it looks like the camera is on a tripod (for example a 10 seconds scene of a woman who talks to her husband in a restaurant), the background still moves a little all the time.</p></li>

<p>'Pro' movies are shot with all manner and mixtures of techniques, including dolly, mount, rig, crane, Steadicam, fixed, zoom, drone etc. I think many people would find a short film that mixed tripod with deliberate ""shaky cam"" to be a bit jarring without a good cinematic justification, but just mixing IS handheld with tripod should be no sin. Story trumps technique anyway -- if your viewers are watching how the camera moves, your story isn't compelling -- or they're film students. (-:</p>

<p>You can then place a speed effect on the single frame, slow it down to 0% playback speed, and it will happily play forever if you want.  Stretch single frame to 5 seconds of length (120 frames at 24fps) and then composite your text on top.</p>

<p>People do this all the time.  Some applications have a ""freeze frame effect"" which is precisely setting the speed to zero for a default number of seconds.</p>

","<p>It sounds like you are using your laptop's microphone, and that your main problem is the lack of a quality mic.

<p>How do I do that?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately you are asking too much from Sony Vegas my friend! In order to get a true effect you'd have to do something called ""rotoscoping"" which means you go into each frame and mask out the background.</p>

<p>You can do this in vegas by going into the pan/crop window on the video event. Look for ""mask"" and then you can key frame out the background with the pen tool there.</p>

<p>There is no way to automate this so you'll have to key frame quite a bit. Then once you have just the person visible you duplicate the track beneath it and uncheck the mask on the duplicate. You then can add lense blur or gaussian blur to create the desired effect.</p>

<p>Unless the clip is super short I wouldn't recommend doing it this way though. It takes a lot of time even for skilled maskers.</p>

At the moment, the the software just expects single values for the meta data, so storing two different values for the sampling rate would make things more complicated. Would it be possible to either convert these two values to one value or just choose one of them?</p>

<p>MediaInfo reports what is played by a decoder, depending of its capabilities:<br>
- if your decoder is able to play an HE-AAC stream, the stream will be played at 48 kHz (the frequecy of the ""core"" + the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_band_replication"">SBR</a> data).<br>
- if your decoder is <strong>not</strong> able to play an HE-AAC stream, the stream will be played at 24 kHz (the frequency of the ""core"" AAC)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I always thought one audio track can only have one sampling rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. You can have a ""core"" stream with a specific sampling rate, decodable by old players, and an additionnal sub-stream in the stream with additionnal data for having 48 kHz for decoders capable of decoding such additional sub-stream.</p>

<p>Note that it is same for e.g. channels, with HE-AACv2 you'll get a mono ""core"" + <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_Stereo"">PS</a> for upgrading to stereo. or AC-3 (and DTS) can have a 5.1 ""core"" lossy stream for old decoders + extra data for newest decoder in order to get 7.1 and/or lossless.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the moment, the the software just expects single values for the meta data, so storing two different values for the sampling rate would make things more complicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are interested only in the ""maximum"" capability, don't care of the second value.
If you use the command line or DLL, you can say to MediaInfo to not show info about legacy players with --LegacyStreamDisplay=0 option.</p>

<p>Note : this is not ""24-bit"" as I read in another comment, bit depth in AAC is ""dynamic"" so no bit depth is shown for AAC (it would be shown for e.g. PCM). This output with several values is wanted by design (showing how an old decoder would decode the stream), and you can disable such behavior with the option provided.</p>

","<p>Professional film makers generally use audio recorded separately from the video on dedicated recorders using professional mics (using XLR cables and the like).  3.5 mm audio connectors in particular are almost exclusively a consumer level connector.

<p>If you want to be able to do it in camera, then you will need to look in to rigging.  Many consumer/prosumerish mics that work via 3.5mm jacks are designed to mount on DSLR hot/cold shoes.  You can use video rigging to connect your GoPro on one mount point and a cold shoe mounted external mic on a cold shoe mount point on the same rig.  This will keep them together in an easily handleable form factor while keeping the mic securely attached to the same rig as the GoPro.

","<p>There are two approaches you can take based on budget.  The first is to record audio in camera, the other is to record audio to a dedicated audio recorder and mix it with the video after.  The former is cheaper, but the latter will generally produce better quality.</p>

<p>As far as features, beyond HD, you are mostly just looking for good performance in whatever lighting conditions you will have and then looking for good color and video quality.  Best bet is to look at sample videos from them to find one you like.  I'd also recommend taking a look at the GoPro, it's one of the better, cheaper video cameras available and would probably work well for your needs.</p>

<p>If you want something more general purpose, you could also look at a DSLR with video capabilities such as a Canon T4i which would allow for high quality stills as well as high quality video.</p>

<p>Your best bet for narrowing down your choices is really going to be to think about what else you might want to do with it and how much you would like to spend, then look at what is in your price range.</p>

<p>If you do want a dedicated audio recorder, the Zoom H4n is a reasonably cheap and decent option that will allow external microphones to be used for recording audio.</p>

<p>In the past, major TV channels were only in the market, and they had their own reporters and photographers to make their materials. Nowadays, there are many small channels (even personal ones), and I doubt if they take of care of copyright issues at all.</p>

<p>As a more specific example, how to obtain right to use a part of a Youtube video in an online show, which will be posted on Youtube ?</p>
","<p>Very broadly speaking, you have a much easier experience obtaining permission if you are not making money from someone else's content.</p>

<p>Most copyright laws recognise 'fair use' -- a small quote or a clip that is proof of someone else having said something.  It is customary and advisable to put such clip in a box or window to show that the content is being referenced.  Fair use for a small portion of text or video is easily established than a picture, for a picture is the entire content.</p>

<ol>
<li>For images, search engines usually have a license filter in the search. Usually, it errs on the side of caution. Unfortunately, you have to contact the original agency or person and obtain permission to use.</li>
<li>Youtube now has content signature comparison and will warn you that you are using someone else's content but will leave it up to the copyright owner to enforce it.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, if it is does not fall under 'fair use' and is clearly someone else's copyright, you will have to track down the owner and obtain permission.</p>

"What is the relationship between hardware acceleration and DXVA/QuickSync/Cuda?","1200","","<p>Many video playback applications (e.g. <em>VLC Player</em>, <em>MPC-HC</em>, etc.) are highly configurable. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>VLC Player</em> allows you to enable: <em>QuickSync</em> and/or DXVA</li>
<li><em>Freemake</em> allows you to enable: CUDA and/or DXVA</li>
</ul>

<p>What I am trying to understand is... what is the relationship between hardware acceleration and these technologies?  </p>

<p>For example, can you enable DXVA to leverage GPU based hardware performance AND enable <em>QuickSync</em> to leverage CPU based hardware acceleration?</p>

<hr>

<p>It is my understanding that...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DirectX Video Accelerator (DXVA)</strong>

<ul>
<li>This type of hardware acceleration improves video encoding/decoding performance by routing 'work' to the GPU (integrated or discrete).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intel QuickSync</strong>

<ul>
<li>This type of hardware acceleration improves video encoding/decoding performance by routing 'work' to the CPU - specifically a dedicated processor die that is responsible for performing video encoding/decoding operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)</strong>

<ul>
<li>Is a closed API developed by NVIDIA that not only gives direct access to the the GPU's virtual instruction set, but also allows for data to be retrieved from the video card so that additional processing can be performed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
","<p>They are all forms of hardware acceleration, which broadly, just means that specialized hardware is doing things faster than the basic CPU normally could.  The exact nature of what each type of acceleration does depends entirely on the software you are using and the hardware you are using.  </p>

<p>Some hardware is very purpose specific.  Something like Intel QuickSync is a specific hardware encoder and has limited functionality because it can only serve it's purpose driven role.  This is similar to any other dedicated encoder, such as the integrated encoder used for NVidia Shadowplay or the dedicated encoders on devices like the Matrox MXO2 or BlackMagic Intensity.  There are other rolls other than encoding that could be filled by a purpose driven card, but encoding is certainly one of the most common.</p>

<p>Other hardware, such as modern GPUs (CUDA or OpenCL based, I think ATI has a term too, but can't remember it) and video editing or mixing acceleration cards, such as Black Magic's ATEMs or Matrox's older RT line of real time editing cards, are designed to provide more general purpose functionality.  Depending on the hardware they may either offer a wider array of specialized functionality or simply a general purpose parallel processor that works better for video purposes.  In these cases, the functionality is made available to software, but it is up to software to utilize the processing capabilities of the hardware and the exact nature of the acceleration will depend on which algorithms and processing they choose to offload to the hardware.</p>

<p>Another option, as far as APIs are concerned, is something like DXVA, which strives to unify multiple technologies.  DirectX in general is a system for interfacing software and diverse graphics hardware.  It looks for any hardware that tells it that it can fill a role and then will utilize that hardware to do a job when software asks for the job to be done.  I'm not super familiar with DXVA, so I don't know if it puts any specific requirements on hardware (some directX stuff does), but on the hardware end, the implementation could potentially differ greatly and could use either CPU features or GPU features, depending on what's available to it.  It may or may not be directly implemented in terms of the more hardware specific feature sets (CUDA, QuickSync, etc), but it is designed to work across diverse hardware, so you know less about what is going on under the hood.</p>

<p>All of the technologies can be used to speed encoding, but the general purpose technology can also be applied to just about anything that you can process in parallel, so they can (potentially) impact render times as well (the time it takes to make the images that are going to be encoded).</p>

  <p>I really want to know how this gets automatically edited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The technique is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key"" rel=""nofollow"">chroma key</a> and consists of considering as transparent all pixels of the colors within a specified range. This is usually used with a bluescreen or a green background. The image is then simply layered over another background.</p>

<p>As you have noticed, chroma key is not limited to postprocessing: <a href=""https://www.google.fr/search?q=chroma%20key%20real-time"" rel=""nofollow"">a lot of software products</a> can do this in real-time for live streaming.</p>

<p>By the way, if you have used Google Hangouts, <a href=""http://www.googleplusdaily.com/2013/07/google-effects-for-google-hangouts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">one of the effects</a> consists of replacing the background by an image. Don't be mislead by this, since this has nothing to do with a bluescreen and doesn't require any specific color for the background; I imagine that Hangouts' algorithm rather assumes that parts that don't move are the actual background.</p>

"Using Multicam Editing How to Color Correct an entire angle","1194","","<p>Am new to Premier CS6 - working with Multicam editing.  Having success but stuck on color correction.  I am able to create a multicam clip and do my edits using the Multicam Editing window (very slick and fast).  Also able to adjust those edits in the timeline to improve timing.  Sweet.</p>

<p><em>How do I color correct (or add an effect) to an entire angle in a multicam sequence after I've applied the edits (or even before)?</em></p>

<p>If I drag the effect into the timeline it sticks only to a particular edit and won't get to all the edits from that angle.  I can't drag it into the upper-left window (""browser""?) and don't know how else to apply the effect.  </p>

<p>I've read some online but am hitting a wall with how I get to the underlying video footage behind the multicam edit.</p>

<p>Can someone hold my hand and guide me?</p>

<h3>Detail Steps Taken in CS6</h3>

<ol>
<li>Place video files (angles) in the project browser</li>
<li>For each file, double click to preview video and then set corresponding in-points</li>
<li>Select all video angles in project browser, right-click, and choose <em>Make multicamera clip...</em> (by in-point)</li>
<li>Place new multicam clip in the sequence</li>
</ol>
","<p>If all is correct you enable the multi camera mode on a sequence containing the different angles in different tracks as shown in the image below (this is CS5.5, but CS6 is similar).
  The image shows a sequence containing 4 different clips which represent 4 different angles.
In this example these are just a collection of random footage, but it works the same if you have actual different footage from different angles.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B01Li.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>click on <code>Multi-Camera -&gt; Enable</code> and then you can switch witch camera you want in <code>Sequence 02</code>.  </p>

<p><strong>According to the information in your question you've already come so far.</strong></p>

<p>Now if you want to color correct one angle (lets take the angle called <code>Leaf.MOV</code>) just open <code>Sequence 01</code>, apply the effect to the clip (drag and drop on the <code>Leaf.MOV</code> clip) and this changes should propagate into your multi-cam edits.</p>

"HDMI Compressed vs Uncompressed mode","1189","","<p>What is the difference between HDMI compressed and uncompressed modes? My understanding is that in compressed mode the TV handles the decoding. Is this right?</p>
","<p>The TV still has to translate the color information and format, so there is, in effect, still some decoding on the TV.  The difference is that it is uncompressed.  The output from the device matches whatever the source captured, in whatever image format the source uses, but there is no loss of detail from applying compression.</p>

<p>Compressed requires vastly lower data rates and is easier to transfer to the TV, but the quality is substantially lower.  Uncompressed requires a high quality source and a very fast data connection, but also provides the highest possible quality as the signal is not compressed with lossy compression schemes.</p>

<p>It's better to perform this type of operation from within FCPX, instead of the Finder via copy/paste.  With the project selected in the Project Library, choose File->Move Project...  As long as you have an external drive connected, the resultant ""location"" dropdown menu will be populated (instead of saying ""no value"").

"Transcription Methods/Times","1174","","<p>I figured I'd leave a question here while I did the manual labor, but what do you find is the best way to transcribe footage?</p>

<p>Basically what I do now is load up the videos in VLC, and open a TextEdit (mac), then watch it through normally or double speed until I get to a part with the interview, then I mark that timecode on the TextEdit, and go watch through the interview in triple-quadruple slowdown, so that I can keep up with what they say and not have to constantly stop and start it back up.</p>

<p>With this way it seems like I'm doing somewhere around 5 minutes real time to transcribe a minute, which comes to about 12 video mins a realtime hour. And I was just wondering if there was a better way you guys already know about. I'm not sure I trust auto-transcribe-type things.</p>

<p>Do you think this slowing the vid down and having to go back 5 seconds only a few times when I can't quite tell what he's saying because it's so slow, is saving more time than watching it in real time, pausing, writing, going back and watching the next part?</p>

<p>Or do you know better ways? Seems transcribing is the most time-consuming part of my workflow. </p>

<p>Since VLC is opensource, would it be possible to combine VLC and a Text Editor...something like VLC on the top and the text editor on the bottom, and whenever you hit a certain key, it automatically puts the timecode in the text, and you can use VLC's shortcuts while typing? Etc?</p>

"Techniques and technologies for synchronizing multiple audio and video streams","1157","","<p>I'm hoping to produce an amateur movie.</p>

<p>I may be renting some equipment: (professional camera, microphone and digital recorder) but I hope to primarily use my own equipment: camera phones, professional microphones, analogue audio mixer, audio digitizer and a laptop. I hope to produce the video on an open-source video editor (Linux or Windows).</p>

<p>In case it needs to be said, I'm on a near-zero budget! The biggest concern I have is how I will synchronize a phone camera with an external microphone fed into the laptop.</p>

<p>Are there any techniques to help with this? I had a go before and it's surprisingly hard getting the audio perfectly sync'd with the video. Are there any tricks?</p>

<p>Also, what industry-standard technologies are used for synchronizing professional microphone setups with video, and between multiple cameras? I assume there are at least a couple of old analogue and newer modern digital methods?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: I looked at <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/3646/merge-audio-and-video-in-post-production?rq=1"">this link</a> but it didn't go into detail or explain different options. </p>
","<h1>The professional way</h1>

<p>Professionally done, all cameras and audio recorders will have a running (SMPTE) time code, which can be configured in 'free run' mode - meaning the time counter runs regardless whether we record or not (ie, STOP mode).</p>

<p>At the beginning of the shooting day, all recordists (cameras, audio) will sync their clocks. This is done either to SMPTE 01:00:00:00, or to the time of the day.</p>

<p>Then all video clips and audio files (broadcast wave files - BWF, which is just a WAV file with time code imprinted) will be 'timestamped' - the time at which the clip was recorded is part of the file header.</p>

<p>In addition, these recorders allow you to choose the folder and file prefix of the recorded clips. A simple case is when all crew (camera and audio) set this prefix based on the shooting day ('Day01' for example).</p>

<p>Then when the audio and video clips are imported to the video editing software, there's alway an option to 'spot' the clips to their original time code. This way, the alignment of video and audio happens nearly automatically.</p>

<h1>The non-professional way</h1>

<p>Before the days of digital equipment, the syncing between pictures to audio was done manually with the help of a clapper (clapperboard):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3ntI.jpg"" alt=""A photo of a clapper""></p>

<p>Upon the director's instruction 'Cameras', both the camera men and audio recordists will aim at the clapper; then the clapper is clapped.</p>

<p>Later on, each clip is brought consecutively into the timeline (clips are numbered - there's a way to know which came before the other). The sync is done manually, by finding the video frame at which the clapper jaws were hitting each other; on the waveform display, you can see a transient from the sound the clapper makes. So it's all about moving the audio transient to the clapping frame.</p>

<p>For your purpose - you can just clap your hand in front of the camera (although visual and auditory labelling can be of great aid later on, but this too can be improvised).</p>

<p>Note that in the professional industry, this practice takes place until today, even if all equipment can stamp timecode.</p>

"Will I lose quality when converting avi to mkv?","1157","","<p>I have a lot of *.avi files with either 1 audio track or several. All of them are mp3 encoded. The video codec is xvid4. </p>

<p>However, when I play these avi files I can choose between the audio tracks (if there is more than 1 audio track) but they are named ""audio track 1"", ""audio track 2"" and so on. </p>

<p>That's why I want to convert them into mkv files since they support audio track names. </p>

<p>Would I loose any quality if I convert them?</p>
","<p>AVI and MKV are both containers, so in theory it should be possible to transfer your contents with no further loss. I can't say for certain if MKV can wrap xvid4, but it's very likely. You shouldn't need to decode / re-encode to transfer the contents, just demux / remux.</p>

"Youtube 720p video has more MB than 1080p","1155","","<p>I watched a video and downloaded with idm in 720p. I don't like the resolution and I decided to download 1080p. But I saw 720p is nearly 21 MB but 1080p is 10 MB. And I opened the video(1080p) I saw it is better than 720p. Why?</p>
","<p>I tried this with the video provided in the comment.
The reason why the 1080p video is smaller is because it has a lower bit-rate (327 vs. ~207 Kbps). In the case of this type of content its likely that the bit-rate for the 720p version is too high. Same for the audio the 1080p version has 96 Kbps and the 720p version has 144-155 Kbps.</p>

<p>A possible reason why this is the case, is how YouTube handles 720p and 1080p video. Unlike the 720p stream the 1080p stream isn't truly constant in it's bit-rate. For 1080p YouTube uses a protocol called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP"" rel=""nofollow"">DASH</a>"" which adapts the bitrate of the video on the fly to meet the bandwidth constrains of the user which might change during streaming. You get lots of video bits from the server which might differ in bit-rate depending on your current connection. So if you download the same video on a very slow connection it will probably be even smaller.</p>

<p>In this case it saved you bandwidth while having better quality, in other cases the 1080p video could actually look worse than the 720p video, though DASH is pretty smart so usually you will probably end up with a better looking 1080p.</p>

","<p>Premiere is your best option unless you plan on spending a boatload (thousands and thousands) on an Avid system.  I'd suggest working on smaller sets of cameras at a time and then working off the combined feeds.  You can use multicamera editing mode with several cameras at a time, make the best choices out of those and then run each of those sequences in to another multicamera sequence to further resolve them.</p>

<p>the quality of the generated file significantly decreased. The original file was of size <strong>1,5GB</strong> whereas the resulting file was of size <strong>~300MB</strong>.

","<p>As you are hardcoding subtitles, the video (with the subtitles added) <strong>will be re-encoded</strong>. </p>

<p>You can use the CRF rate control method to modulate the quality of the output.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i grdedFinal.mov -vf subtitles=portSbs.srt -crf 18 -c:a copy gradedFinalwithSubs.mov

<p>If the quality's not acceptable, lower that value till it is - in exchange for a larger file. Of course, don't decide based on file <em>size</em> but on visual quality. x264 is very good at compressing video while maintaining subjectively perceived quality.</p>

"What codecs/formats are appropriate for full motion video recording for youtube?","1123","","<p>I'm recording video game footage via lossless methods, after which I need to compress them and upload them to youtube. I'm not sure which format and/or codecs are best for this. I've been experimenting with various formats and I've found MP4 (and whatever Camtasia 7 uses as a codec for that) to be mostly effective, but the quality varies by game.</p>

<p>Particularly I've noticed that lower-motion games like platforming games (Super Mario) or RPGs (Final Fantasy) seem to be fine no matter what format they're in; few ""blocky"" compression artifacts, almost no issues due to how often key-frames are used. But higher motion games, especially First Person Shooters (Halo) and scrolling shooters (Gradius) suffer relatively severe issues with ""ghost"" images between keyframes and generally blocky or choppy video.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a generally acceptable video codec for high motion gameplay footage?</strong> I want to absolutely minimize compression artifacts like ghost images between keyframes, blocks of colors, etc. To maximize quality my recordings are at 30 FPS, 32 bit RGB at naitive resolution and file size isn't a major limiting factor (but I'd like to keep files under 1 GB due to low upload speeds). So assume the source file is basically pristine. How should I compress these high quality source files of full motion gameplay <strong>to be uploaded on youtube?</strong></p>

<p>To reiterate the general requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lossless or high quality source file at 30 FPS, 32 bit RGB</li>
<li>Full motion recording, minimal compression artifacts wanted</li>
<li>Resolution only limited by the game's res; generally 480p, 720p or 1080p, occasionally weird resolutions when a game requires them (but if those come out less-awesome it's not a big deal, I accept that those are problematic).</li>
<li>Youtube will receive and process the final product, so their processing determines the final quality. I want something that Youtube will butcher the least (their videos do not always match my upload file's quality and I'm not sure why)</li>
</ul>

<p>If it matters I'm using Camtasia Studio to edit/render the video before uploading, and I use a combination of Camtasia Studio and Fraps to record videos. I have the K-Lite Full codec pack on my PC, so Youtube is the major limiting factor for codecs. Fraps records lossless, and Camtasia <em>can</em> be lossless but I've been taking to DivX for encoding the initial recording in  Camtasia. My videos are at the whim of Youtube's re-encoding process for the final product as well, but I'm not sure exactly what they use for that.</p>
","<p>Personally I always choose MP4 container and the H.264 codec as this is also the codec YouTube uses in the final video stream.</p>

<p>What key-frame rates and compression you need really depends on the footage and it's unfortunately close to impossible to give as a generic answer for this reason.</p>

<p>If you have a lot of movements you will need key-frames more often as well as lower compression. This will of course result in larger file sizes as a key-frame is basically a full frame image. There are only costly compromises for this.</p>

<p>How much you need to compress depends on the frame size, the bit-rate that will be used, f.ex. there is no point in compressing at a high bit-rate if YouTube then re-compress to match their max output bit-rate, which again means even worse quality due to re-compression.</p>

<p>If I should recommend a generic compromise it would be to reduce the frame size from 1920 x 1080 to 1280 x 720 instead. A viewer won't notice small details if there are a lot going on in the movie. It of course depends on which eyes one uses, the viewer's eye or the producer's eye. What I'm trying to say is that there is the factor of ""psychology"" you can use as well. </p>

<p>You won't need 32 bits. 32-bit is just 24-bit RGB with 8-bits for an alpha channel. You should record and process in 24-bit in cases as this. This will save you some file size and processing time.</p>

<p>Camtasia uses it's own proprietary codec so you will always need to re-compress to another non-lossy or lossy format.</p>

<p>Basically it comes down to trial and error approach, and then experience from that, as each individual video may require a different approach. I saw a similar post here with a link to YouTube guide-lines. Check them out and use them as a basis for settings (especially bit-rate settings).</p>

<p>Also try not to think of the movie in terms of technical perfection but rather how a viewer will view it and for what reason (is the content interesting enough then quality matters less, think news-reports).</p>

<ul>
<li>The intro title <em>fills</em> with a smoke-like mask. Where can I find a mask like that, if possible for free?</li>
<li>The subtitle and the rest of the titles appear with each letter growing independently. I guess that could be done using a Stroke for each letter and animating it? Seems like a lot of work. Isn't there an automated process for that?</li>
<li>The transitions in 0:16, 0:49 and 1:05. How are those done?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd also appreciate any kind of basic tutorial about color correction to achieve the same looks as that video.</p>
","<p>Let me start by saying what they did there is actually far, Far, FAR simpler than you think.  I'll try to break it down shot by shot what is going on.</p>

<p>On the title, there are three main elements.  The first element fades in on a time lapse of clouds moving across the mountain.  This appears to be the same time lapse they use a few seconds later for the first subtitle.  </p>

<p>Superimposed over that are two elements.  The first and faintest is a fairly small image of a cloud.  It appears to simply be luma keyed or possibly additively blended (bright parts make bright, dark parts don't impact) and probably has a black background  It's quite probably a CG cloud using particle simulation.  </p>

<p>The last element of this first shot is a title composed of white text.  The text is blended in using a gradient dissolve that bases the time it dissolves being driven by the luminance of an underlying image.</p>

<p>As a demonstration, lets start with <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/41107941@N00/3457064913/in/photolist-6gumXt-6guohB-6guoSz-6gupCx-6gypPS-6gyuEf-6gywjA-6gyCcs-6uV2p1-6yggUd-6yp3cr-6ytc5N-6DdxdM-6DhFqC-6HkgLN-6MsbWQ-6Pt9aZ-6TZ3Mv-6VMB6T-6VRCQC-6XwcxD-77adrR-783nYh-79UJgB-7bfATD-7cS8sT-7m5PXk-7nL1wa-7weRvZ-7xYqP5-hTVxhW-e1TJrt-bCgBAv-drYF5S-bVDGTM-dPWAgT-dPWzYk-dzDbgz-aSrq4T-as7pHU-as7pNN-8UoJAp-8UoCt4-8UoCna-dn1pch-8UrGVs-bjipD6-fQwnYj-bv7uaZ-9cX4a9-ffZHWc"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> CC image from centophobia on flikr.  With some quick rotating and additive blending (Lighten) in Photoshop, applying a greyscale mode change and then using the curves to give us contrast more suitable to our purposes we get an image like this (after resizing and cropping to fit a 1080p video).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mBD10.jpg"" alt=""Title Dissolve Image""></p>

<p>Now that we have an image to use for the base of our dissolve, we can actually do the title.  Here is a screenshot from doing this in Premiere.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BjsaW.jpg"" alt=""Screen shot of building the gradient title""></p>

<p>First, I imported the image I created and then I made a basic title with plain white block letters.  I then added both of these to a sequence.  Note that the smoke layer should be in the sequence with the title, but it should not be visible.  </p>

<p>Next, I added a Gradient Dissolve to the title clip from the Transition Effects.  Set the Gradient Layer to the layer you put your gradient map on (the smoke image.)  </p>

<p>Next, adjust the settings to add softness to the transition (this is what causes it to work through the gradient rather than having a hard line being exposed).  </p>

<p>Set a keyframe on the transition completion at the beginning and end of where you want it to dissolve in (using the little stopwatch looking button) and set a keyframe at 100 for the beginning and 0 for the end.</p>

<p>When you run it you should get something like this:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcR3foXldOE?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Now for the other titles, it does appear to clearly be working off the strokes of the characters, so there are a few different possibilities.  The most likely one would be to use a similar gradient dissolve, but build the mask based directly on the title.  Drawing a gradient on each character would allow for the control of the reveal to be precisely controlled and the Transition softness would be set to 0 or near 0 to keep a hard line.</p>

<p>As an example, here's doing something for a large letter K.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkEWP.jpg"" alt=""Gradient to reveal K""></p>

<p>They may have had a titling software that could generate the gradients for them.  Stroke animation is another option, but you'd have to use true vector shapes for the fonts then and a lot more manual work would have to be done to keyframe each different part of each stroke.  The gradient way isn't particularly quick, but it's probably less effort than stokes.</p>

<p>The final transition appears to just be a  highly motion blurred image flying across the frame really quickly and having the other clip after it clears the field.  Just take an image with a lot of horizontal blur, send it across within a few frames and cut to the other video the moment it completely obscures the scene.</p>

","<p>It depends on what you are doing, but generally for video you want pretty tight manual control to avoid changes during a shot.  What I often do when I'm in a hurry (and don't want to determine optimum settings manually) is to let the camera figure out what it wants for settings and then manually enter those.</p>

<p>That said, while changes in exposure during a shot can be very distracting, it's still better to get the shot than not get it, so occasionally I may shoot with the camera fully on auto and use exposure compensation as necessary to adjust the exposure.  This can be particularly useful for live events where you don't have time to adjust manually.  Note that if you are shooting with multiple identical cameras however, it is best to lock everything down (including white balance) to ensure a consistent look between cameras.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, there isn't a right answer, just be aware of how distracting changes in exposure can be during videos and balance the need to have the camera adapt vs the need to control when and how adjustments are being made for the content you are shooting.  It's best to try to avoid uncontrolled changes, but not at the expense of not getting a shot.</p>

"Handbrake x265 Optimal settings for ripping DVD","1088","","<p>I want to rip DVDs(MPEG2) to MKV using Handbrake for viewing on PC, and currently i am not sure about the settings of the x265 encoder.
Can anyone suggest the optimal settings for:</p>

<ul>
<li>CRF : 19 ? 23 ? 25 ?</li>
<li>8-bit or 10-bit (Main or Main10) (Has 10-bit any advantages for low-res like DVD ? )</li>
<li>Encoder tune - none / SSIM / Grain ?</li>
<li><code>bframes</code> or other parameters ?</li>
<li>CFR or VFR ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also i am open to any suggestions for tuning of an other parameteres.
I have searched by google but all guides are not specific enough for the case of DVDs.</p>

<p>The resolution is 700x574 , source MPEG2 bitrate is 3Mbps</p>

<p>Additional question - are there any good guides for general parameter tuning x265 like <code>bframes</code> ?
Thank you very much.</p>
","<p>What does optimal mean to you? Smallest size and time to finish an encode does not matter? If so then pick the H.265 MKV 576p25 profile (apparently you have PAL content) set ""optimal for source"" under dimensions to not stretch or modify the picture in any way. Set the refresh rate to ""same as source"". CRF 20 should be good enough for most DVDs, you will know when you compare a CRF 17 encode of the same source and cannot make out the difference, if you can try the numbers in between or going even 3 steps further down. 10-Bit won't hurt, but won't benefit much either regarding picture quality, if it would and you're doing lots of filtering, you could even go with 12-Bit (I have it available on Ubuntu, the choice of filters though is limited and won't improve picture quality dramatically I'd say, nor would it justify changing the subsampling if it is availabe). Change the preset from slow to slower if you have no problem waiting for the encode to finish, this is one of the more important settings as it controls all the other setting depending on the profile, level and picture size. Disabling bframes was only imporant for older devices which had trouble decoding H.264 streams with bframes, since you said you care mostly about the result when watching H.265 content on a PC this shouldn't be of any concern.</p>

<p>Simply put, if the resolution is not greater than 1080p60 and playback on current mobile devices is not considered to be important then I choose H.265 with slow or slower on Main10 and 4:2:0 subsampling. That's optimal regarding of what most desktop computers can handle today, some may require video acceleration though to display noisy 1080p 60fps content (e.g. performers dancing in front of big LED displays). That's may experience so far and I never touch the encoder tune setting, I expect the default to be good enough when I'm already throwing this much CPU time at it that the tune may be negligible.</p>

"Canon T3i with Blackmagic Design Intensity to record plays?","1086","","<p>My school's drama department wants to record their shows. As the school only has really old cameras, the recordings look like garbage. I have a Canon T3i but the recordings stop at 30 minutes. This is where the Blackmagic Design Intensity products come in. The Intensity products can record from an HDMI input. So, in theory, I can connect my T3i's HDMI out to this and record the show on the computer. My only concern is the time. Our shows are about 2 hours. Would this cause the camera to overheat? Would this even work at all?</p>
","<p>The problem is that the HDMI output on your T3i is not clean.  You would still have all the UI from the camera interface placed on it.  Higher end cameras (like the 5D mark iii) and some other makes have a clean output option, but I don't believe the T3i does.</p>

<p>You can use the third party MagicLantern firmware to force the interface clean, but at that point you can also have it automatically start a second recording after the first ends and bypass the 30 minute limit altogether.</p>

<p>As far as sensor overheating, it really depends on the camera model and the temperature in the environment you are shooting and how fast it dissipates waste heat.  MagicLantern generally displays an indicator of the temperature of the sensor with some color coding as to how hot it actually is.  You could try using ML and see how your camera handles it, but it may very well run too hot when trying to do two hours at a time.  You won't know for sure until you try though.</p>

<p>As others have noted, ML may or may not void your warantee.  It technically isn't a full third party firmware, but rather just runs on top of the underlying OS that is built in, but it can tweak settings that aren't normally tweaked internally.  There are plenty of cases of people getting warranty replacements on cameras that had had ML installed, but you should be aware that it is not a completely risk free process and in rare cases ML has caused cameras to become unresponsive (or even brick in exceptionally rare cases).</p>

(The default YUV <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">colorspace</a> range is a legacy of analog television signals and carried over into the digital realm by the MPEG committee and hence still widely adhered to by most digital video formats)</p>

"Issues looping a stream with FFMpeg","1056","","<p>I'm trying to overlay a video on top of an image. The problem that I'm facing is that the video duration that I want is longer than my input video's duration.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, I try to generate a streaming loop and hardcode the duration that I want using the parameter ""t"".</p>

<p>I'm using the setpts filter to make sure that my container format (.mp4) accepts past frames by rewriting their timestamps:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.jpg -stream_loop -1 -i video.mov  -filter_complex ""[1:v]setpts=N/(FRAME_RATE*TB)[1v];[0:v][1v]overlay=x=main_w*0.44:y=main_h*0.33[out]"" -map [out] -t 00:00:15  out.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>So the command reads as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>take one infinite input where each frame is image.jpg</li>
<li>take another infinite input (video.mov) by looping (-stream_loop -1)</li>
</ol>

<p>Each frame will go through the filter:</p>

<ul>
<li>setpts will re-write the timestamps for source 1 (video.mov)</li>
<li>overlay will put each setpts-ed frame from video.mov on top of each frame from the initial input (image.jpg - 0:v)</li>
</ul>

<p>This should continue until a file with 00:00:15 seconds is created.</p>

<p>This command does generate that file but the video.mov isn't looped, once the first loop finishes the last frame is repeated until the output movie ends.</p>

<p>FYI: I made a couple more tests:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -i movie.mov -filter_complex ""[0:v]setpts=N/(FRAME_RATE*TB)[out]"" -map [out] -t 00:00:30 output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, it generates a movie with 30 seconds duration with the input movie looped to fill the output movie</p>

<p>on the other hard, if I add one more input file:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -i movie.mov -loop 1 -i image.jpg -filter_complex ""[0:v]setpts=N/(FRAME_RATE*TB)[out]"" -map [out] -t 00:00:30 output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>This will not create a movie with 30 seconds, although one of the inputs is never used, ffmpeg creates a movie file with just one loop of movie.mov and the same length of movie.mov.</p>

<p>Any advices please ?</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>

"Windows software for recording multiple video/audio sources?","1052","","<p>I'm looking into options for recording video game sessions, including multiple different video and audio sources. I'm only at the planning stage of this, but here is basically what I want to set up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have PC set up as recording hub for gameplay sessions either on same PC or on nearby game console</li>
<li>Capture game footage, both audio and video, either capturing PC game footage or via capture hardware for console games (PCI or USB connection)</li>
<li>Capture footage of players, probably via webcam attached to PC</li>
<li>Capture both game and players feeds simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm fairly new to a lot of this stuff, so I'm not particularly sure what I'm looking for here. Can anyone provide some recommendations of software/hardware that would work for what I'm trying to do?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've just discovered Telestream's <a href=""http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm"">Wirecast</a>. It seems to be the sort of software I'm looking for, and I can use it to stream or save it to disk. It also has support for some Blackmagic Intensity capture hardware, which I was already looking at. Has anyone had experience with it or seen a similar, possibly cheaper alternative?</p>
","<p>If it were me, I would try using a video recording interface with RCA connectors, as most TVs have an RCA audio/video output. Most of these connect via USB and come with some sort of software. For the video of the players, use a second software program and webcam/etc. to capture this. If you had a Mac, this could probably be sync'd in Final Cut Pro. I'm not familiar with all the software for Windows. </p>

<p>The main part I don't think you'll be able to accomplish (without expensive software) is capturing all of this in-sync with each device. This would require some sort of video-switcher software, similar to what TV stations use for live broadcasts. The method above is probably your cheapest route, if you can handle syncing it after the fact.</p>

<p>What type of camera or software, do I need to achieve that?</p>
","<p>You need a camera with a relatively large sensor and a fast lens.  What you are seeing is actually a property of optics called Depth of Field.  Only a certain distance from the camera can be in focus at any given point for a given aperture and focal length.  The degree of how out of focus it appears is also relative to the size of the image being projected (thus the distance from the point where the image inverts) and thus, larger sensors show more blur.</p>

<p>Cheap cameras often use very small sensors and thus have a hard time getting a shallow depth of field, however any DSLR will achieve it quite easily, as will any more professional video camera with a larger sensor.  Shoot with the aperture as wide open as possible and try to have the camera relatively close to the subject with the background as far away as possible.</p>

<p>Technically, increasing focal length will also decrease the depth of field, but then you have to move back from the subject which will increase it again.  You want a small depth of field close to the camera so that the background can be significantly out of focus.  If it is too out of focus, you can adjust the aperture or the ratio between the camera, the subject and the background to make it less blurry (by expanding the depth of field).</p>

<p>You can also use many online Depth of Field calculators to figure out a shooting situation with a particular camera prior to trying it in real life.  They won't visualize it for you, but they will give you an idea of what distances will be in focus and which will be out.  There are also lots of great articles on depth of field over on our <a href=""http://photo.stackexchange.com"">Photography</a> sister site, though they don't deal with video specifically, but the principal is the same.</p>

<p>In a pinch, you can fake it as well using masks and blurs, but that's really not an ideal way to do it.  In camera always looks better.</p>

"What are some free (or cheap) options for hosting home videos that have copyright music in them?","1040","","<p>I uploaded some of my home movies to YouTube for family members to watch but there were a few songs in there which YouTube said were copyrighted. The only music in there was the theme song from the old Mission Impossible but there's not arguing with Google. So they muted the whole video.  Fine, thems the rules.</p>

<p>Are there any other options for hosting a video like that for private viewing (even though I had the Youtube video set to ""private"")  and thus allow copyright music to be in the video?</p>

<p>(I assume that putting copyright music into a home movie, not for distribution beyond my immediate family falls under Fair Use and that the issue is that YouTube is under a lot of pressure to avoid copyright issues... but I'm hot trying to broadcast this to 100's of people. Maybe 10 or so. But just trying to avoid burning DVDs for them.</p>
","<p>On youtube, I would just contest the copyright holders.</p>

<p>For it to be fair use you need to be able to ask these 4 questions (not all 4 need to be good to be fair use):</p>

<p><strong>1. What are you doing with the copyrighted content?</strong> If you are doing something highly transformative with the content then you will have more room under the fair use doctrine.  You are more likely to be covered if you are saying something quite different from what the original creator was trying to say.</p>

<p><strong>2. What is the nature of the copyrighted content you are using?</strong> Use of creative or fictional content (for example, a film or cartoon) is less frequently allowed under fair use than less creative, non-fictional material.</p>

<p><strong>3. How much of the original content are you using?</strong> You should be careful to use a reasonable amount.  Just use enough of the copyrighted content as you need to in order to get your point across.</p>

<p><strong>4. Will your work serve as a substitute for the original?</strong> If your video will take away views or sales from the original then it is less likely to be covered under fair use.  Additionally, you shouldn’t create work that occupies markets that copyright owners are entitled to exploit.</p>

<p>The thing you need to realize is EVEN if you are fair use, the copyright holders can still sue you and the courts will then need to decide if your usage of the material constitute fair use. Home movies are protected by fair use. Feel free to contest them, but again depending on length and use, see court case of a 29 second home video, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz_v._Universal_Music_Corp."" rel=""nofollow"">Lenz vs Universal</a></p>

<p>Now the other issue is that contentID system was abused by the rights holders and there recently has been pushback by youtube.</p>

<p>""YouTube also is noting that it had updated its ContentID tools to try to avoid some of the excessive takedowns associated with it. For one thing, it appears that ""certain rightsholders"" are being asked ""to perform in-depth audits of their references before they can make any new claims."" Reading between the lines, that sounds like YouTube is hitting back at rightsholders who have abused ContentID. That sounds good, though we'll have to see how it plays out in practice. YouTube is also making it easier to pull out incidental audio in videos that might trigger a ContentID claim, improving the way MCNs can ""fast track"" a response to claims they think are bogus, and is promising to more aggressively investigate ContentID abuse.""</p>

In ffmpeg, colorspace is defined by the <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#colormatrix"" rel=""nofollow"">colormatrix filter</a>. However, you must convert <em>from</em> some colorspace.

<blockquote>
  <p>ISTR that if you give ffmpeg RGB it assumes its full range, it also by
  default converts using 601 matrices. Although it has a number of
  colourspaces defined which can be accessed in the libs using the API,
  ffmpeg itself makes no use of them (Although I have a nagging feeling
  that that may not be completely true anymore either).</p>

<p>Any solutions for this?</p>
","<p>There are at least three ways to put things together in Premiere Pro: linking, grouping, and nesting.  Linking is the lowest-level, assigning audio tracks to a single video clip.  You cannot link two video clips together, regardless of how much audio they may want to share.</p>

<p>Grouping allows you to treat multiple clips of audio and video as part of the same group for selection, moving, trimming, etc.  If you have a bunch of related clips (video and audio) which you want to behave as a unit, but whose relationships you still want to be able to see, use grouping.</p>

<p>Nesting creates a new sequence with all the audio and video clips you want to behave as if it's just a single entity.  You can change the relationships (and of course edit) within that entity, but to do so you have to open up that sequence on its own timeline.</p>

<p>You probably want to use either grouping or nesting, not linking for this case.</p>

<p>The area should fit just around the rocket but it doesn't.</p>
","<p>I get the feeling you think collapse transformation means something that it doesn't. </p>

<p>What Collapse Transforms does is to leave all the transformation properties in the subcomp intact and available to the comp that it's nested in. It's basically like you've got all the layers still in the outside comp, just grouped into one layer for ease of organisation.</p>

<p>Without collapse transforms on the subcomp is pre-rendered and treated like a single piece of footage. So, for example if any of the layers of the sub-comp extend off the edge of the sub-comp's boundaries they won't be cropped with collapse transforms on.</p>

<p>Here are two subcomps, both contain text that extends past their outside edges:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LgFAS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LgFAS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If you scale down a raster layer in the subcomp and then scale it up to its original size in the outer comp, without collapse transforms on it will be pixelated, because it gets pre-rendered to the resolution of the subcomp, and then scaled up in the outer comp.</p>

<p>Here they are scaled down in the subcomp:</p>

<p>Another effect of collapsing transforms is that you lose the ability to change the transfer mode of the subcomp in the outer comp. The layers in a collapsed transform-ed subcomp apply whatever transfer mode they have inside the subcomp, again, like they were actually in the outer comp, just grouped together.</p>

","<p>No ffmpeg code can identify interesting frames. At most, there are filters which detect representative frames and filters which identify frames with a scene change. So, at best, there's a thumbnail filter for this, sort of. It can't detect ""interesting"" frames but it detects representative frames. So, frames from the middle of fades should be out. </p>

<p>Syntax is</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -ss 50 -i in.avi -vf thumbnail=300 -vsync 0 thumbs%d.png
</code></pre>

<p>This will pick one representative frame from each batch of 300 consecutive frames.</p>

"What is Pivot in Color Grading?","1007","","<p>Most of the controls I at least have a basic understanding of from Photography and other design applications (Affinity Photo / Photoshop / Lightroom etc). But not Pivot.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/pdf/speedgrade_reference.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SpeedGrade Manual</a> the word Pivot doesn't exist at all. Pretty big omission but I'm resourceful and know other applications exist. So even though I don't use it I pulled up <a href=""http://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/DaVinciResolve/DaVinci_Resolve_12_Manual_2015-07-27.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DaVinci Resolve's guide</a> which states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pivot:</strong> 
  Changes the center of tonality about which dark and bright parts of the image are 
  stretched or narrowed during a contrast adjustment. Darker images may require a lower 
  Pivot value to avoid crushing the shadows too much when stretching image contrast, while 
  lighter images may benefit from a higher Pivot value to increase shadow density adequately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perfect cause this actually sounds like exactly what I need. Except when I use it there's absolutely no change in my video and I've got no idea why:</p>

<p>Here's the original:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTzwN.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTzwN.jpg"" alt=""original footage""></a></p>

<p>Here's the footage with the pivot greatly pushed up, yet no change:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dxqWg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dxqWg.jpg"" alt=""footage with pivot increased""></a></p>

<p>I don't know if I'm not understanding the Pivot or what. I'm not seeing any difference though.</p>
","<p>As you know, the contrast function darkens dark colors further and lightens light colors further. Software without a pivot parameter assume that the point where darkening becomes lightening is exactly in the middle, at 0.5 (for a color range of 0 to 1). Those with a pivot parameter allow to move the pivot point up or down. Shifting the pivot slightly down (e.g. from 0.5 to 0.4) results in dark-medium colors (let's say 0.45) not anymore being darkened, but lightened. </p>

<p>In your image, the effect is not that visible because most of the colors are already very bright, very dark, or just in the middle.</p>

<p>If you want to lift or lower your midtone details, I would suggest that you use a gamma or midtone control instead.</p>

"Music-sync'd Strobe effect in video","1002","","<p>What's one way to get a strobe flash effect in video (you know, virtually, in software) that's synchronized to the beat of a music track?</p>

<a href=""http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/trapcode-sound-keys/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/trapcode-sound-keys/</a></p>

<p>From the promotional text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now it's easy to synchronize motion and sound in After Effects. With
  Trapcode Sound Keys, your audio-intensive animations no longer require
  extensive keyframing. Visually select parts of an audio track and
  convert them into keyframes, syncing footage with audio using
  amplitude or frequency ranges. Sound Keys is applied as a regular VFX
  effect, so you can save its settings with your project, generate
  keyframes into output parameters, and link keyframes to expressions.
  The possibilities are huge, just like the beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By using the generated key frames you can hook them up to almost any effect or behavior that you want.</p>

"What is the productive way of doing multiple speed changes in a video editing project?","987","","<p>I have to stitch various pieces of footage together, and the final result will be about 1–1.5 hour long.</p>

<p>Because of all the needed changes (blurring faces, inserting images and icons in certain places, synchronising the footage pieces among each other and fading them out\in with right timings etc), my project map starts to look like <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Ym2vMxV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. The #3 and #4 tracks are just transitions from one piece to another. In tracks #1 and #2 is how most tutorials tell to deal with blurring\changing a screen area (duplicate the track above itself and then pan\crop the duplicate).</p>

<p>The problem is that in multiple places the video also has to be sped up\slowed down, and when I do it, the footage length changes like a fractal curve, and all the alignments get messed up. And besides <em>these</em> speed changes, the whole eventual video has to be sped up again once more too (x1.5).</p>

<p>This looks like one of those things that I’ll be cursing myself about later, because a simple and overlooked mistake led to losing huge amounts of time\work, so I decided to just ask about it now: am I doing it wrong, and if so—what’s the more productive way of dealing with many playback speed changes in relatively big editing projects?</p>
","<p>It isn't a perfect solution, but you can use nested sequences in order to apply your edits separately from your speed changes.  This way the speed changes impact the final video instead of just one clip.</p>

"How can I increase the resolution of a mobile clip?","985","","<p>Few days ago, at early morning I saw something falling in a slop in the sky. It wasn't a plane but something with a color of fire and so bright! I wonder what it could be, so I recorded it on my mobile. But as my mobile camera resolution is really very low, it wasn't that clear to understand. While I show it to someone, then they don't understand the exact thing that I saw. </p>

","<p>You can't recover information that isn't present in the data you have.  Sometimes there's useful information hidden by noise, and filtering can help.  However, esp. in the case of downscaling/upscaling, information is just gone.</p>

<p>These wiki links are way too general and mathy to be specifically helpful, but this is the theory behind why you can't recover quality once it's gone:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory</a>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory</a></p>

<p>Think of it this way: if you could somehow increase the quality of a video, we'd just use that procedure on 100x100 pixel videos to upscale them to beautiful 4k displays, and fit HD movies on floppy disks.</p>

<p>Same deal if you compress the hell out of a JPEG image:  it'll be all blurry and blocky, and the details of the source are gone.  If they were recoverable from a tiny JPEG, then we could compress anything as much as we wanted and still have great-looking images.</p>

<p>These things are as impossible as perpetual motion machines.  Sorry to dash your hopes. :/</p>

<p>All that said, it's possible you could do some smoothing or filtering on an upscaled version to produce something that looks to a human eye more like what you saw.  With the aid of words, you might have some luck getting your point across.</p>

"Why is compression rarely included as a builtin effect?","984","","<p>I've bought a new analogue mackie mixer that I'm very happy with, but if I need one effect it would be compression. The mixer comes with 16 builtin effects and not a compressor. Is it expensive to make or why is compression not included? Instead I have reverbs and echoes which are not very applicable for the dry sounds of a small room that I want to create. </p>
","<p>While you often see compression in the effects section of editing software, it is dynamics rather than actual effects.  In the traditional sense in the live world, compression is not considered an effect.  The software world simply does it that way because they are all software filters, but even then they are often in a dynamics category.</p>

<p>Compression, Expansion, Gating and Limiting are all dynamics.  I'm not sure if the effects hardware could do compression, but the controls for the parameters on the effects are certainly too limited.  You need attack, release, ratio, threshold at least and gain and soft/hard and auto attack/release options are common.  You can't adjust these with the very basic effects controls provided in the board.</p>

<p>There are boards that have built in compression, but they list it under dynamics normally.  There are also stand alone compression units you can get that you can use the inserts to feed the signal to.</p>

"Cannot capture (HDMI) output of Graphics Card with BlackMagic UltraStudio","982","","<p>I am trying to convert an HDMI video signal (from my computer's graphic card) to SDI using an Ultrastudio 3D from Blackmagic.</p>

<p>I successfully converted an HDMI signal from my Canon 5D camera, but it does not work when I send a signal from my graphics card.</p>

<p>What is the difference between HDMI from a camera and HDMI from my GPU?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>My goal is to send GPU generated content, not a film, so there should be no HDCP problems, am I right? So far I tried to sent my GPU output considering the Ultrastudio 3D as an extended desktop.</p>
","<p><strong>What solved the problem:</strong></p>

<p>Check your capture software settings. All settings (your monitor/capture device settings, your hardware settings and the settings in your capture software) should be correct and equal.</p>

<p><strong>What can help track down similar issues:</strong></p>

<p>Very likely a framerate issue. Only the 4K version of the Blackmagic Capture cards supports 60FPS and your monitor is or was probably set to 60Hz or 50Hz, though your capture card probably is only supporting 30FPS @ 1080p (assuming thats your resolution). (Edit: In this case not true, the UltraStudio (4k) does support 60fps even at 4k over SDI but if someone else has this issue, have a look at the specs of your capture card)</p>

<p>Assuming your are using Windows go to the resolution settings and click on advanced settings after selecting the capture card ""display"" and then go to the ""Monitor"" tab and select a lower refresh rate like 30FPS or 25FPS. Then set the same refresh rate in your capture settings.</p>

<p>On a Mac you can use a tool called <a href=""http://www.madrau.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SwitchResX</a> to change your refreshrate or alternatively in your case simply set your capture settings to the output settings shown in the System Informations for the Capture Card ""display"". So same resolution and refresh rate.</p>

<p>If your really unlucky your Mac doesn't recognize the UltraStudio as a display or the Ultrastudio isn't sending any EDID information, though I somewhat doubt that's the case. I had this issue all the time with the 4K PCI-E capture card from Blackmagic, it always was a settings mismatch.</p>

<p>Also make sure that if you want to capture a video that's playing back, it isn't protected by HDCP like Jim Mack suggested.</p>

","<p>First you need to extract the frame that you wish to freeze. This is easy:</p>

<pre><code>avconv -i test.webm -vf ""select='eq(n,1)'"" out.jpeg

<p>Then you want to put that frame for the appropriate time interval.</p>

<p>Firstly you will see that i didn't want to mess with audio, but if you'll find it too difficult, let me know and i will look into the quick way to align it as well.</p>

<p>Now what i'm doing here consists of several strange things. Firstly i am taking that frame that was generated before and i am creating a continuous loop video from it. And afterwards i cut first 5 seconds of it with the first filter <code>trim</code>. Then i do a quick and dirty move of all the timestamps of the main video by 5 seconds (125 frames). And finally comes an overlay filter, which places the grabbed frame entirely over the blank screen that was generated by shifting the video 5 seconds into the future.</p>

<p>Modifying the profile manually by copy/pasting each of the clip's properties is very time-consuming and error-prone, I am sure there is a better way to do this.</p>
","<p>Curious... recent versions of KDEnlive practically push this option into your face once you add a clip with properties different from the project.</p>

<p>If the option got disabled in your setup you can enable it again by going to <code>Settings</code> -> <code>Configure KDEnlive</code> -> <code>Misc</code> (selected by default) -> <code>[ ] check if first added clip matches project profile</code></p>

<p>I am using this option in version 0.9.6 on Debian, but I've seen this behaviour in 0.9.4 and probably older versions as well.</p>

<p>Also if you got used at some point to dismissing this funny question window you get immediately when adding a clip, try to control the urge this time - the question is whether KDEnlive should adjust the project properties, which is what you want ;-)</p>

"LifeSize DVI Input from multiple devices with in-line scaler","963","","<p>We have a number of meeting rooms that were equipped with an AV cabinet and projector each. There's a local PC and input for mobile devces at the meeting table.  All of the cable runs are HDMI (those longer than ~10m are supported by active Kramer Cat6 Baluns). We've standardised on 1080p for our displays. Locally, everything works well.  </p>

<p>We've upgraded two of these rooms for conferencing. This includes: A second, wall mounted TV and a LifeSize Express 220. Input are handled by a Kramer VS-84 (or VS-44) matrix switcher, such that the image to the Projector is mirrored to the DVI-I Input of the LifeSize unit, making it possible to present to remote participants from any of the input devices with ease. </p>

<p>Now, the LifeSize 220 series doesn't support 1080p input for presentations. This wasn't regarded as a significant issue, since a compressed, downscaled input was judged sufficient for passive observers. </p>

<p>To rectify this, we installed a Kramer VP-424 scaler in-line between the switch and the LifeSize. (HDMI in and out). This would give us a clean 720p feed to the LifeSize while all the local displays stay at 1080p.</p>

<p>Here's where the problems come in: At both sites, output from the scaler was being corrupted or not displayed. The pattern of this varied depending on the input device and the scaler used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kramer VP-424: Macbooks and iOS devices Display, but are subject to very regular (1/s) single-frame flashes of noise with audible popping sound. Windows laptops display cleanly</li>
<li>CYP SY298H: Similar to the Kramer, with audible poppping, but the image would drop to flat blue and 'No Input', or appear squashed up into the top 1/6 of the screen. </li>
<li>Extron DCS 301: A clean display from Windows laptops, but a no output whatsoever from any Apple devices. </li>
</ul>

<p>We've also tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many (many) cables. </li>
<li>Direct device input to the Lifesize (Everything works, as the device will downscale to 720p on connection, but it requires manual connection wrangling prior to meetings, which isn't sustainable)</li>
<li>Discussing with our installer. (They're being brilliant about this, but they're as stumped as we are)</li>
<li>Discussing with LifeSize support (Also very helpful, but there are too many variables and 3rd party products for them to suggest anything concrete)</li>
<li>Not having the scaler: All inputs are corrupted as the switch tries to feed 1080p into the LifeSize.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can't enforce input device type, as support for everything is required in our environment. We can't really mandate 720p across the board as, although it's sufficient for passive viewing, the presenter still needs 1080p (lots of small text and Wireframe 3D in some cases).</p>

<p>I'd love a one-shot solution to this, but if anyone can give me some pointers in how to further debug the problem, I'll be in their debt. (I can provide diagrams of the setup, if it'll help)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong> </p>

<p>At AJ's Suggestion, I removed the switch from the equation. (Mackbook 1080p@60 -> Scaler-> Lifesize). To start with, the issue was just as apparent. Then I tried something we'd eliminated previously, and switched off the <code>HDCP on Input</code> option.  Suddenly I'm looking at a clean, scaled 720p image!</p>

<p>So I put the switch back in line and now all I see is what we saw with earlier tests: A blank screen. Still, this means that without the switch in place, HDCP isn't needed. If I can disable it in the entire chain, then we might be sorted. I'll report back when I've done some further testing.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Something I didn't point out previously: If I take the codec out of the equation (Mac -> Scaler -> TV), then I don’t see any problems at all, regardless of the HDCP setting. </p>

<p>So we have HDCP being agreed from device to switch to (if it's enabled) scaler. It looks like the scaler -> Lifesize negotiation is where it's failing. Both agree on HDCP support, but then something goes wrong that causes this regular popping. </p>
","<p>I've found an answer to my specific problem that's a little ugly, but might be of some use.</p>

<p>The basic premise is to ensure that the first device in the chain does not support (or is capable of disabling support for) HDCP. Macs and iOS devices are opportunistic when it comes to HDCP; they'll always attempt to negotiate it, but will fall back to unencrypted when there's no protected content playing. </p>

<p>The Kramer VP-424 scaler has a setting ""HDCP on input"" that will, when disabled, prevent that negotiation. By putting one of these inline between the input and the switch, HDCP never starts and the whole chain is unencrypted:</p>

<p><strong>Mac</strong> -> <strong>VP-424</strong> (HDCP Disabled, 1080p output) -><strong>VS-84H</strong> Switch -> <strong>VP-424</strong> (HDCP Disabled, 720 Output) -> <strong>LifeSize Codec</strong>.</p>

<p>The scaling doesn't have any noticeable effect on image quality or unduly effect sync times, which is a bonus. I still get 1080p out to the local projector and downscaled 720p to the codec. </p>

<p>As I say, it's neither pretty, nor cheap; but it works.</p>

"Does having hardware encoding chip help?","959","","<p>I've been googling for a while now so I finally decided to ask others as well as I'm pretty darn confused.</p>

<p>I'm looking to be able to stream at 1080p at 60fps ( from a gaming laptop, it's more than capable, running actual game at 300fps uncapped ). I know about <code>ShadowPlay</code> and it's fairly easy to use but it's annoying how it automatically changes my stream's title and the quality is pretty bad even at best settings.</p>

<p>Then, I have found the <code>Live Gamer Extreme</code> which has 1080p at 60fps recording and hdmi passthrough, but it doesn't have h.264 encoding chip so I'm receiving RAW data in <code>OBS</code> ( there are cards that have hardware encoding chips already but those don't do 60fps as far as I can see )</p>

<p>So, does having a h.264 encoding chip help in any way ? 
Because I'd like doing the whole thing on one laptop and not having to use two laptops one for gaming and one for encoding would be great.</p>

<p>In <code>OBS's Encoding</code> tab I can't find any option like <code>No encoding needed</code> since the signal is already encoded, so, should I look anymore for 60fps w/ encoding chip or should I go with this game capturing card and use the other laptop for encoding.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance !</p>

Export separate clips, import them to Motion 5, do the edits, export the clip again, importing it to Fincal Cut Pro X and replace the old clip? This seems quite cumbersome.</p>
","<p>There's no really good workflow, I think, yet. The best way I found is to export the video out of FCPX and import it into Motion. Apple thinks that you don't need to work in Motion solely, you only go there to create an effect, title, whatever and then put that thing right on top of a clip <em>in Final Cut</em>. </p>

<p>The problem there is that sometimes you'd rather want to have all the editing options Motion offers and just want to see how the video's going to look like. That problem is, to my knowledge, not solved yet. I hope this is all going to change in the future.</p>

"Are there any (visible) differences between R1 and R2 DVDs (or blu-rays, thereof)?","955","","<p>I was wondering whether there is any visible difference between Region 1 and Region 2 movies. Region 1 is encoded in 23.976 fps standard, right? And Region 2 is 25 fps.</p>

<p>I know for a fact an eye can see the difference between 23.976 fps and 25 fps. A lot of low-budget movies/web series are being released lately since the Canon dSLRs can record video and there definitely is a visible difference between the standard 24 film fps and the ""fluid, unnatural"" 25 fps.</p>
","<p>There is no visible difference, unless the DVD/BR publisher labels their discs as such.  Any region code (or even region-free data) can be burned or pressed on to any media.</p>

<p>Furthermore, region encoding (at least on DVDs, and I assume on BRs) has nothing (technically) to do with the video format.  Now, you're <em>likely</em> to find Region-1 DVDs in NTSC format, Region 1 is the U.S. and Canada, and the U.S. and Canada use NTSC, but there's no technical barrier to creating a R1 DVD in PAL format.</p>

  <p>Bi-Cubic/Integration - Best image resizing algorithm available in
  Vegas. Quality differences will be most noticeable when using very
  large stills or stretching small sources.</p>

"How to precisely synchronise an audio and video track from separate devices?","951","","<p>Yesterday I recorded a full day event with a Panasonic HC-V700 Full HD Camcorder and I also captured the audio with a Zoom H4n Handy Recorder using the audio feed provided by the venue.  At the start I captured a ""clap"" in front of the venue microphone and the video camero to synchronise the two sources.</p>

<p>How do I precisely synchronise the audio and the video tracks using the ""clap""?  </p>

<ol>
<li>I am using Adobe Premiere CC.</li>
<li>I have got the two tracks almost synched.</li>
<li>My Adobe Premiere skill level is basic.</li>
<li>I can't work out where the nudge tool is to move the audio track via the keyboard.</li>
</ol>
","<p>First off, if you have audio with your video (that you want to replace with your high-quality audio recording), then step #1 is to nudge the Zoom audio track to line up the impulse of the clap with the corresponding impulse of the scratch audio from the video file.  To do that, you need to <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/timecode.html#changehowtimecodeisdisplayed"">change the Timecode Display Format to Audio Samples</a>.  Once you do that, audio can be nudged a sample at a time, which makes it possible to get two audio files to agree, rather than a frame at a time, which makes it impossible.</p>

<p>To learn the keyboard shortcuts (which include the Nudge commands), print and study <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/default-keyboard-shortcuts-cc.html"">this page</a> from the Adobe manual.  TL;DR: Nudge right is Alt+Right on Windows and Cmd+Right on OSX.  To nudge five frames at a time, add a Shift.  To nudge left instead of right, change from the Right Arrow to the Left Arrow.</p>

<p>Once you have your high quality audio aligned with your principal video, it's time to sync all the rest of your video with your principal video.  If you shoot at 24fps and capture audio at 48kHz, a single frame of video is 2000 audio samples, which is a lot of samples to sort through looking for the start of the clap!  But don't worry about that.  Once you have established principal video, all other video should be aligned based on video frames, not audio samples.  Unless you shoot with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genlock"">genlock</a>, your video frames are not going to be perfectly in sync, which means that other video tracks could be as much as a half a frame early or late when aligned on a frame boundary.  Such is life.  Audio that's off by half a frame is not unlike sound that's coming from 21 feet away instead--about a 20ms delay.  There's nothing to do about that because (1) video needs to sync to video--you cannot slip it half a frame, and (2) you're not using audio from the other video tracks, you are using your Zoom audio, and that can only be locked to a single reference point.</p>

<p>If you are really OCD about timing, you can average your video offsets, weight them according to which is most prevalent/important, and align the audio so that lies at that weighted average point.  I don't know anybody who does this, but if you have two video streams that are 1/2 frame apart (worst case) and you split the difference with the audio, your audio/video error changes from 1/48th of a second worst case to 1/96th of a second worst (and best) case.  Only you can tell if that's preferable to you.</p>

<p>I know that 4mbps is considered a low bitrate for 1080p, and the video will look bad on a full-HD display due to the compression artifacts. </p>

<p>However, during playback on a <strong>720p</strong> display, the 1080p video will obviously be downscaled to 720p. </p>

<p>My question is: On the <strong>720p display</strong>, will the 1080p video <em>(which is being downscaled to 720p in real time during playback)</em> look as good as the 720p video <em>(which has the same bitrate)</em>? Or will the 720p video <em>(which was downscaled from 1080p to 720p by the encoder)</em> look better? Or will both of them look the same?</p>

<p>I would run some tests to see this for myself, but my system isn't powerful enough for 1080p encoding. I'm looking for some expert views on this. </p>
","<p>When you ask how something will 'look' you're in the realm of the subjective. Things 'look' different to experienced professionals than they might to the average viewer.</p>

<p>But still, the 1080p video will not be as good no matter what you view it on. When you encode at a low bit rate you aren't removing pixels, you're mostly removing high frequencies. Doing either will reduce the amount of information, but in different ways and with different visible effects and artifacts.</p>

<p>The information you lose with very lossy encoding doesn't lie in the spaces that inevitably are discarded when you downscale. You'd lose in both domains. But how that 'looks' depends to some degree on who's looking.</p>

"Update keyframe animations only every third frame in After Effects","943","","<p>I am new to After Effects and I have the following problem with an animation of mine:</p>

<p>I have a walk cycle drawn for 8 frames per second.
The composition has 24 frames per second, so each frame of the animation is shown for three frames. The background moves using keyframe animation.</p>

<p>But now the background moves every frame whereas the animation only moves every third frame, which looks odd as the feet seem to slip. If I change the frame rate to 8fps, it looks fine.</p>

<p>So is it somehow possible to change the movement of the background so that the position is only updated every third frame?</p>

<p>I would like to avoid changing the frame rate of the whole composition to 8fps, as then other parts of the animation become less smooth.</p>
","<p>I don't know if there is an easy way to do it directly.  You could do some modular math in a script for the keyframe positions, but that's kind of complicated and non-user friendly.  An alternate approach would be to do an additional nested composition.  </p>

<p>Make an animation composition for your character that is at 8 FPS, perhaps bring in the main composition as a backplate while putting it together, then remove the backplate and import the animation composition at 24fps as a stationary composition.</p>

"I have a TS file. How do I render it?","940","","<p>(I decided to post this here because it doesn't fit very well into the Gaming category, but it is a gaming question.)</p>

<p>I had the idea to try streaming video to Twitch one on computer and to record it with VLC on another, using Livestreamer. The result is a TS file. </p>

<p>If I wanted to upload it to YouTube, how would I convert it to mp4 (Or is there a better format?) without loosing quality?</p>

<p>Also, I hear people talk about rendering their video. I understand that when a video is first recorded it is in 'raw' format. What does rendering entail?</p>
","<p>""Raw"" ususally refers to uncompressed video (though this is <em>technically</em> wrong), meaning you probably have a very large file. Rendering is the process of re-encoding the video using another codec, usually to reduce file-size while maintaining a decent enough video quality. The reason that .mp4-files with the H264-codec are widely used is that they offer a very good filesize-quality-ratio.</p>

<p>In your case, a very compressed file is <strong>not</strong> what you might want, since Youtube reencodes your video when you upload it. Every reencoding reduces the video quality, so the double reencoding will result in poor quality.</p>

<p>If you cant upload the .ts-file directly (I don't think Youtube allows this), you could reencode it to an mp4 or avi (imho, the latter is better in this case, though getting the encoding settings right is a bit tougher for beginners). The key is to chose a very <strong>high bitrate</strong> and the <strong>same framerate and resolution</strong> as the original video. Using a high bitrate, the quality-loss resulting from the reencoding can be minimized. However, this will result in very large files (espacially if you choose avi), which depending on your internet connection might take very long to upload.</p>

<p>There is a range of free encoding programs out there. I'd recommend <a href=""http://www.xmedia-recode.de/en/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">XMedia-Recode</a>, but you could also try <a href=""http://www.xilisoft.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Xilisoft Video Converter</a> or <a href=""http://www.pcfreetime.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Format Factory</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to <strong>cut</strong> your video (i.e. add an intro and an outro, put different videos together, remove unwanted parts, ...), you'll need a video editing program. There are some freeware programs for this (none of which are as good as professional, paid programs), you can find a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_editing_software"" rel=""nofollow"">list of video editing software at wikipedia</a>.</p>

","<p>In the simplest case, half the frames -- every second frame, or all the even (or odd) numbered original frames -- are just gone, discarded. The frame rate of the resulting video does not change, it's still 60 fps.</p>

<p>It's possible to create a video where each new frame is a blend of two original frames but this is unusual and often not effective. Or in a field-based system where each original frame is composed of two distinct half vertical resolution images, you can discard half the fields instead of half the frames. But still, the result will be 60 fps.  </p>

<p>or is it irrelevant. If your answer is ""get an Go Pro"" or whatever, I still need to know how to mount it. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The key thing to remember about mounting any camera is stability. What makes Go Pro so attractive to many cinematographers are the many mounts available for it that fit the camera snugly on a helmet, car, surf board, or what have you. There will always be some motion when attaching a camera to say a helmet, but with the Go Pro helmet mount, you have minimized any residual motion. The only motion that is left is that of the helmet moving.</p>

<p>Trying to mount a camera to a baseball hat and expecting the stability of a helmet mount Go Pro or Contour camera is not easy or trivial.</p>

<p>First of all a baseball cap is not rigid like a helmet, there is flex built into the cap even in the beak. Adding an adapter may make things worse. You will have to experiment. Consider ways to make the cap as rigid as a helmet and ways to attach the camera so it moves with the cap without any swaying or extra movement.</p>

<p>For every design you think will work you will need to make test shots that cover the conditions of the actual production.</p>

<p>I think this can be done. But without your camera or your cap in my hands I would not venture a guess on how you go about it. This is truly hands on experimental kludge-0-matic work.</p>

<p>My idea is to use rotobrush in After Effects and somehow fill it using 'content aware fill', but I cannot find anything like 'content aware fill' option. I have seen some tutorials on web about how to  remove an object from a steady background, but this case is more complicated.</p>

<p>PS I don't want to mask it frame by frame in Photoshop.</p>
","<p>If the camera and background are both stationary (or perhaps very near stationary) you should be able to extrapolate a background plate from looking for frames where the man and paper are not blocking that part of the shot.  Once you have that background plate, you can mask the newspaper and expose the appropriate portion of the background plate.</p>

<p>This works best if the camera isn't moving, though you may be able to do a camera tracking in the event of small camera movements and still get workable results by matching the position and angle of the background plate to the camera (though it will likely require far more advanced background plates to account for any perspective changes).  With anything more than minimal movement of the camera though, the perspective changes will become too severe to compensate for and you won't be able to build a background plate from previous/future frames.</p>

<p>At that point, you would actually have to build a model of the scene in order to be able to render out the background to fill in with perspective adjustments and that would be far more complicated than re-shooting.</p>

<p>Note that this also does still require frame to frame adjustment of the mask and requires building the back plate by hand as well.  It is still non-trivial, but isn't quite masking frame by frame in Photoshop since the rotoscope tool should work for it.</p>

<p>If shadows are visible on the background as well, then you may need to make some animated masks to emulate the shadows on the background plate as well.  Either way, we're talking about a pretty elaborate operation most likely depending on the quality you need.  If any shadows from the actor are visible though (particularly soft shadows against not flat objects) the quality level will drop like a rock and the complexity will go higher fast.</p>

<p>If you do get hit with shadow issues or background movement issues (and reshooting really isn't an option) you may actually be served best by replacing the background entirely).  If you build a fixed background plate that doesn't have any shadows from the actors, people are not super likely to notice the lack of shadow compared to a gap in the shadow or a reconstructed shadow.  It would involve even further rotoscoping, but might be easier than trying to build a believable shadow.</p>

<p>Reshooting really is the best option, even in the ideal case though.</p>

<p>The question is: how can I avoid having the first duplicated frame? If this can't be avoided, is there a way to remove it without re-encoding the video or just skipping it while computing the differences?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Following @Mulvya's answer, I tried his suggestion but it doesn't work somehow. I understand that it's hard to find the problem without having the video file so, instead, I'm posting a screenshot with the first 4 frames of each video to help you visualize my issue.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dErAF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dErAF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the compressed video has a grey third frame that messes up the differences.</p>

<p>The reason behind this edit is that I'm sure that the given answer should work, at least from my understanding on how filter mappings work, but it probably doesn't work because the issue here is not what I thought it was.</p>

<p>I expect to have an almost black third frame on the differences video, and not the full frame from the original one.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Tried the new solution which somehow worked the first time but now it doesn't anymore.</p>

<p>Here's the list of the commands that I'm using, the result is still the same of the screenshot but now the problem has moved to the second frame instead of the third one (basically it's like how the screenshot would be without the <em>00000.png</em> frames)</p>

"Remove audio from video annotation in ActivePresenter","910","","<p>I've been creating screencasts lately (cut with real footage) with ActivePresenter.</p>

<p>ActivePresenter allows one to add ""annotations"" and they can be in various formats including both audio and video clips.

"Does the M4V file type have direct support for Audio?","903","","<p>I am working with a video vendor who just ripped a dvd and sent me BOTH m4v files AND aac files (audio and video separately),. When I asked him why he did not just send 1 m4v file with the audio and video in ONE FILE, he wrote me back this (Which I need to confirm is true or false):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>.M4V is a video format that doesnt directly support audio so the computer automatically rendered the audio files out as .AAC. What you
  say is an .MP4 format is really just the ""file type"" and not the
  extension itself.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn't sound quite right, but I am not a video pro. But I do not want to have to splice all these files together again.</p>

<p>Please advise: Is his statement (above) correct?</p>

<p>Thanks, sleeper</p>
","<p>I find the m4v extension a bit confusing.</p>

<p>For MPEG-2, the .m2v extension is associated with a raw video stream. Those files can have only video.</p>

<p>Now for MPEG-4, Apple uses the .m4v extension as a container format, and in fact if you rename an .m4v file to .mp4 it is likely to play on players that only read .mp4 files, since the two format are essentially equivalent.</p>

<p>I think you would need to check this .m4v file and make sure it is really the container format, and not an elementary video stream similar to what you find in .m2v files for MPEG-2.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable inspecting files with a hex editor, just open this .m4v file, skip the first four bytes and check if the next four are the letters 'ftyp'. If they are, then you have an MP4 container file that should have no trouble holding audio along with the video. If, on the other side, you've got something else, then you may have an elementary stream, in which case you may want to recommend to your vendor to use a different extension for these files. Using .avc is probably more appropriate for an H.264 elementary stream.</p>

"After Effects on Mac: Use touchpad to scroll like in PS or Illustrator","898","","<p>In Photoshop and Illustrator I can 2-finger scroll on the x and y axis. For zooming I can pinch-to-zoom which works seamlessly.</p>

<p>However, Adobe After Effects reacts totally different to this: Pinch-to-zoom results in zooming into the top left corner so the video output ends up ""flying"" out of the lower-right corner of the screen and two-finger-up-and-down-scroll zooms at the center of the video. two-finger-left-and-right-scroll, instead of moving along the x axis, has no effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>I could get used to that if I worked on a PC but why can't I make use of the wonderful touchpad on my mac? It works in other Adobe CC products that I own, so why is After Effects behaving so weird? It's not just that it behaves <em>different</em>, I see no reason why sidewards-moving is not working and why anyone would want to zoom into the upper left corner of their screen.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>This is what happens when I pinch-to-zoom. The black rectangle in the lower right corner is the video and instead of zooming into the video, pinch-to-zoom leads to putting the video out of sight because it zooms into the top left.

","<p>It's so weird the way all the Adobe apps require different muscle memory to do the same thing. Even things that are the same like panning around a work area or zooming. I understand it's because of the history of the apps, but Adobe's acquisition of AE was over two decades ago, they've had time to standardise it.</p>

<p>Until they fix this (and don't hold your breath) you'll have to learn the AE way of navigating your comp window: hold (don't tap) the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> and click-drag with the left-mouse-button / single-finger-trackpad to pan and scroll, scroll-wheel / two-finger-slide to zoom. It will to the point that is in the centre of the comp window, unless you hold the alt key while you're zooming in which case it zooms to the cursor.</p>

<p>Also useful are the <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> keys which zoom in and out (it makes more sense if you think about the &lt; and > symbols which also share those keys, but you don't hold shift) and <kbd>?</kbd> which zooms to fill the comp window.

<p>I'm going to create a audio/visual production with two camera's. One camera uses 1920 x 1080 with 25fps rate. The other camera is the GoPro camera. There are several video settings for the GoPro camera, these are: </p>

<ul>
<li>3840 x 2160 with 15 or 12.5fps</li>
<li>2704 x 1520 with 30, 25, or 24fps</li>
<li>1920 x 1440 with 48, 30, 25, or 24fps</li>

<li>1280 x 960  with 100, 60, or 50fps</li>
<li>1280 x 720  with 120, 100, 60, 50, 30 or 25fps</li>
<li>848 x 480  with 240fps </li>

<p><strong>My question</strong> </p>

<p>Which video setting would you recommend me for the GoPro? </p>

<p>I could go for the 1920x1080 with 25fps rate. But than again I have the possibility to use 50fps. But than again, would the 50fps footage give the 25fps project somehow a quality loss?</p>
","<p>It depends on the shutter speed being used on the other camera.  If the shutter speed is faster than 1/50th of a second, then shooting at 50fps and discarding every other frame would be the same as shooting at 25fps, but it means that your shutter speed must be faster than 1/50th of a second.</p>

<p>If light isn't an issue, then the faster frame rate won't have an impact, but if light may require a higher ISO and degrade the footage unnecessarily.  Similarly, if you aren't planning to need any slow motion shots, then there isn't really any great advantage to shooting at 50fps as you gain nothing.</p>

<p>Overall, say go with 1080p and 25fps on the GoPro unless you need to do slow motion and have sufficient light, in which case go 50fps on the second camera (or better yet, do 25fps for all but the slow motion shots and move to 60fps for the slow motion shots since the frame rate will be altered anyway.)</p>

<p>Additional options, like presets and crf did not change that and I could not find anything on the Internet except that ffmpeg is supposed to always use progressive unless told otherwise.

<p>Any idea what might be causing this and how to fix it? Adding <code>-deinterlace</code> helps with the interlacing, but makes the quality worse.</p>

"Why do SRT subtitles fail to appear in my MP4 videos on iPhones?","883","","<p>I'm using <strong>videojs</strong> in an HTML page to publish a video with VTT captions. Problem is: iPhones do not play the mp4 in the videojs player - it renders the full videojs player, but when you click the Play button, it opens the mp4 in it's native player (QT player, presumably). This is normal behaviour for video on iPhones - but at that point I lose my captions, which are inserted in the videojs player through css.</p>

<p>So I ran the MP4s through Handbrake with imported .srt files. In my local VLC player, the captions appear. But when I put the same files (MP4 + SRT) in the same directory on my web server, the subtitles do not appear on the video in iPhones. In fact, the subtitles - or any subtitles option - also do not appear in the native players of desktop Firefox, Chrome or IE 11 (which uses a QT plugin for video). </p>

<p>It's not a problem of coding (used UTF-8) or server configuration - if I insert two <code>&lt;tracks&gt;</code> in the videojs <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element - one the vtt file, one the srt file - both play, together, in the videojs player.</p>
","<p><strong>Update with answer</strong></p>

<p>It can be done. Run your source files through Handbrake, after importing the subtitle files you want. Then export as Mp4. I've read (a) you should put the SRT file/s in the same folder as the Mp4 on your server, and (b) the SRT should have the same name as the mp4. But (a) is probably wrong (in a text-editor, you can see the subtitles have been coded into the mp4 by Handbrake) and (b) is definitely wrong - two different language SRT files will obviously have different file names.  </p>

<p>Testing... On iPhone, a little speech bubble appeared on the right side of the QT player control bar when it loaded my MP4. Tapping that popped up the two subtitle language options. So, it worked. <strong>But it only worked because</strong> first my tester had to enable ""closed captions"" in his iPhone's:</p>

<pre><code>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Subtitles &amp; Captioning &gt; Closed Captions + SDH
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, an extra chore for users and the result is crappy-looking subtitles anyway. And all this because, unlike Samsungs and most other mobiles I've tested on, the iPhone overrides the videojs player and plays your videos in Apple's own Quicktime player. </p>

"Metal particle Hi8 tape degradation","880","","<p>Recently I was playing a Hi8 tape from 1998, when I tried rewinding and rewatching a part (stopping the tape, before rewinding).  The part of the tape I had just watched was highly distorted and black and white.</p>

<p>So, I've learned the hard way that old metal particle tapes are prone to being erased, when watched.  Presumably, the 'MP' on the tapes stands for metal particle?  These tapes have been stored in a safe place.  How many years before this problem arises with MP tapes?</p>

<p>Is there a better alternative than playing these tapes into a capture card?  If not, I realize that I only have one chance to capture this video.  If this is the only option, I'll expect to capture until the read head becomes too affected by residue, and then stop and clean the head, and repeat.  Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I've found out the hard way there are consequences to over-using a cleaning tape.  The head is either dirtier than before, or damaged.</p>
","<p>You do need to play the tapes onto a capture card, yes. And the sooner the better. You don't just get one attempt, but you will get a slight degradation of quality every play, so you are best off aiming to do it in one pass if possible.</p>

<p>I recently captured about 50 tapes from the late 80's to the mid 90's and I did about half of them then cleaned the head then did the other half. Degradation wasn't noticeable, but I just thought I should do it just in case.</p>

<p>As to how long you can store them - is the safe place shielded from EMF, heat and humidity, then they can last for years, but due to the nature of magnetic tape, the magnetic field strength of particles affects adjacent particles, so quality will degrade no matter what.</p>

<p>When configuring your capture, set it for the highest quality you can afford - as there are utilities which can clean up some noise and speckle once the signal is digitised.</p>

","<p>If you want a hundred images at the same time, you need 100 layers. Often people will make a ""pre-comp"" which is a nested composition. You create a composition with only the images, then insert that composition into the main timeline. Any changes you make to the pre-comp will carry through even after you've laid it into your main video timeline.

"Why does Adobe Premiere Pro modify original footage/asset files (e.g. mov)? (CS6)","872","","<p>Background:</p>

<ol>
<li>A colleague had given me a large 33Gb .mov for use in a project, I
put this file on a backup drive.</li>
<li>I made an identical copy of this 33Gb .mov file and placed it in a folder that I'd use to work on a Premiere Pro Project. </li>
<li>I ran Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and dragged in the 33Gb .mov file into the Sequence (imported it) </li>
<li>Premiere Pro CS6 started conforming the file.</li>
<li>After it had finished, I noticed that
it's Modified Date was just now i.e different to the Modified Date
on the original copy of the file on the backup drive (see step 1)</li>
<li>I ran a BeyondCompare check between the .mov file on the backup drive
(see step 1) and the one that the Premiere Pro project was using
(step 2, 3) and Beyond Compare reported they were different.</li>
</ol>

<p>I had initially thought it was unrelated file corruption of some kind, but I have checked this several times and got the same outcome, so it's definitely Premiere Pro deliberately modifying the file.</p>

<p>So I am puzzled: these are supposed to be the same file.</p>

<p>Why would there be a need for Adobe Premiere Pro to modify the footage?
What does it do to the file?
Would it not be better to create a separate file if necessary?</p>

<p>I can accept this if that's how it works and it's good to know that it was Premiere Pro deliberately modifying the files and not corruption (so my hardware ought to be healthy). But it makes more sense to me if Premiere Pro made separate modified copies for its own use. Modifying the file as it does hinders my process for checking the integrity of backups; if the original asset footage files were the same as earlier copies then it would be easy to know that the backups are OK.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
","<p>It's all about this setting, ""Write XMP ID To Files On Import"" - which confirms that Adobe Premiere Pro is deliberately modifying the .mov file: <a href=""http://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/preferences.html#WSE3BD4A43-7022-4fe6-97F5-95313935347B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/preferences.html#WSE3BD4A43-7022-4fe6-97F5-95313935347B</a></p>

<p>I would love to figure out how to capture/play the sound from the sound films, but the unit is designed to connect to something else, presumably a preamp or stereo system of some sort.</p>

<p>Originally, this unit came with a special cable to connect to the atypical audio ports on the projector, but I don't have it.  Both ports are un-labled.  One appears to be an 1/8"" headphone type jack, and the other is smaller.  I have tried connecting the 1/8"" jack to a number of preamps/mixers, but have not been able to get any audio.  This leads me to believe the 1/8"" jack may be for recording sound to a film, and the smaller one is for playback.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJPCB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The projector you have is for use with the Bell and Howell model 450 cassette recorder. This projector has no optical or magnetic means of playing or recording sound. IN this system, which is a ""Double Sound System"", the sound is recorded on the 450 player/recorder via a special cable that goes between the camera and the recorder. The film itself has no magnetic or optical sound track on it. The recorder records both the audio from a microphone and sync information from the camera, hence the special cable running between camera and recorder. After the film is processed and returned, it threaded into the projector and then the cassette player/recorder is connected by means of another special cable to the projector, via the 2 jacks pointed out in your photo. The jack questioned is a size 3/32.
This special cable is used to deliver sync information that was originally recorded on the tape to the projector for lip sync sound reproduction</p>

Will the repeated conversions begin to degrade the video's quality if I do this over and over?</p>
","<p>MP4 isn't an ideal format for intermediate saves. If you know you'll be re-opening the file, save it as losslessly as practicable, and use MP4 only for the final output.</p>

<p>That said, depending on the encoder and settings you probably don't lose much if anything on subsequent saves. MP4 and similar codecs work by decimating the higher frequencies (details, resolution) in a predictable way. Once you've saved an MP4 at a particular quality setting you've already discarded the information. If you save again using the same settings, there's no information to lose in the areas that have already lost it.</p>

<p>I'm on Windows 7 so don't know why it was an issue to begin with but did the Export as Images instead. Then did a simple Import (Ctrl+I) which detected the jpeg sequence and that worked perfectly. Smaller file size then the AVI SketchUp exported too.</p>

"Converting video with different resolutions slightly affects in file size, why?","858","","<p>I'm converting a video with resolution 960x720p using HandBrake on Mac. When I convert two videos with exactly the same settings but with different resolutions, the file size is almost the same. Actually, the video with larger resolution (960x720p) is slightly smaller than the video with smaller resolution (720x540p). File size of the larger resolution video is 18,7 MB and the file size of the smaller resolution video is 19,1 MB. Like I said, the conversion settings are exactly the same, only resolution is different. I'm using H.264 codec with variable bitrate. Please check the settings from the attached screenshot.</p>

<p>Why the file size isn't smaller on the lower resolution video?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGmXA.jpg"" alt=""settings""></p>
","<p>You are using the same bitrate for each video.  The bitrate determines how much data is used per second.  The resolution has nothing to do with how much data is used, it only impacts the number of points of data which are encoded (and thus determines part of the quality of the video output for a given bitrate).</p>

<p>What you end up with is a lower resolution file that more faithfully reproduces the original format since it has more data storage allocated per pixel where as the higher resolution file produces more pixels in the output, but as it has less data available per pixel, it is a less faithful reproduction.  </p>

<p>It is a fluid question as to whether you lose more quality from the downscale or bitrate being used, so there is no preferred value to change.  In some situations the best overall quality will be to reduce the resolution and bitrate and in other cases the best result will be to keep the resolution the same but only reduce the bitrate.</p>

<p>If you intend to make different resolutions for different connection speeds, you should decrease both the resolution and the bitrate.  This will result in a smaller file with similar relative quality, so long as you use similar compression ratios (the relationship between the size of the input and the file size).  </p>

<p>For example, as a rough guideline, if a video is 1080p and takes 225MB in total, then you would want the 720p version to take around 100MB because there is a little under half the pixels in a 720p video than there is in the 1080p video.  The amount of data used to store each pixel is thus the same, so the amount of artifacts should be pretty similar.  (Though the loss of detail will make it slightly unpredictable, so it doesn't hold exactly.  I'm oversimplifying a bit since compression is actually a pretty complicated field.)</p>

"How would I remove a specific pattern (say, every n-n+59th frame) of frames from a lengthy video file?","853","","<p>I have large video files of screen recordings which I created with Camtasia Recorder. The content I am recording only updates once per minute (1/60 fps), however Camtasia appears to require at least 1 fps for recording (quite silly, really). So that's what I did, and then I tried looking in Camtasia Studio to cut out the extra frames but it seems the only way to reduce the file size without compressing to a lossy format is to manually cut by hand 1 second segments throughout the entire file, but these files are too long to do this by hand (3 files, one of which is 24 hrs and the shortest is 8 hrs).</p>

<h3>How would I cut all but 1 frame every 60 seconds from a video file?</h3>

","<p>FFmpeg has a <a href=""http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#framestep"" rel=""nofollow"">framestep</a> filter to take every <code>n</code>th frame.</p>

<p>There's also <code>mpdecimate</code>, which outputs a frame whenever the input frame is different enough from the previous frame.  (so if exactly every 60th frame isn't perfect, you could use <code>mpdecimate</code> instead to detect the changes, and make a potentially VFR video.)</p>

<p>I didn't test this command; post a comment if I screwed it up:</p>

<p><code>ffmpeg -i in.camrec -vf framestep=60 -r 1/60 -codec copy -map 0 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 16 -movflags +faststart -vsync 2 out.mp4</code></p>

<p>Or use <code>out.mkv</code> if you like matroska better than the mp4 container.</p>

<p><code>copy</code> (stream copy) won't work while dropping frames, I think even for an intra-only codec.  So your output has to be encoded to some codec.  My example uses lossy h.264, but with the quality cranked so high it should be transparent.  You could use lossless h.264 (<code>-preset ultrafast -qp 0</code>), <code>-c:v utvideo</code>, or whatever else you like.</p>

<p><code>-vsync 2</code> turns on VFR output mode, which for some reason isn't the default in mp4.  (but it is in mkv).  You'll want that if you use <code>mpdecimate</code>, but you won't need it for <code>framestep</code>.</p>

<p>A quick google didn't tell me if camrec is already lossy or not.  If it's lossy, then there's no way to get a file as small but with the same quality as just keeping every 60th CamRec frame without decoding them.  (assuming there's an intra-only frame at the point you want one, if the format has any non-intra frames.)</p>

<p>With mjpeg, you can turn a video into a directory of images without decoding, and select whichever ones you want, and mux them up again.  Since camrec frames probably aren't a stand-alone image format, it's unlikely there's something similar, so you just have to use video tools.  Like I said, don't think ffmpeg can do clever things like frame dropping without decompressing, even for intra-only codecs.  Other tools might exist that can do that, for some codecs.</p>

<p>If it's lossless, then it just takes more CPU time to decode / re-encode to a new lossless format.</p>

<p>edit: more about mpdecimate:
As noted in the comments, I added some stats logging to mpdecimate.<br>
<code>git pull https://github.com/pcordes/FFmpeg.git mpdecimate</code><br>
and then build ffmpeg as usual.</p>

<p>Then run <code>ffmpeg -v debug ...</code>.<br>
Or <code>ffplav -v debug -vf mpdecimate  input.avi</code></p>

<p>Testing mpdecimate threshold settings with ffplay is a lot faster than making an encode.</p>

","<p>I can't say what's going wrong or if there's a change to the ffmpeg scripts that would help, but from a practical POV I can offer some advice on how to deal with what you have.</p>

<p>If the difference is due to drift, the fix is relatively simple. If it's due to dropped video frames or audio dropouts, it's probably not going to be fixable without a good bit of work.</p>

<p>The 'drift' scenario is this: you know they're out of sync at the end because you can see / hear the difference. Something near the end doesn't match up. So find that thing and identify its exact time relative to the start, in both the picture and sound. Reduce these times to absolute frames -- in this case numbers will be around 34000 or so at 30fps. Find the <strong><em>ratio</em></strong> of these two values and apply it in Audacity as a speed change percentage (with constant pitch, usually). Check that the audio event now occurs at the same time as the matching video event you noted. If you got it wrong, invert the ratio.</p>

<p>If after doing this you find places in the middle that are still out of sync, you're forced to apply this same technique in multiple segments, or to cut / move / blend the audio in sections. I don't envy you this task.</p>

"I'm looking to make a Nuke expression: I want the maximum value of an animation curve of another node","849","","<p>I want to feed a custom made NoOp node with a floating point slider with the maximum value of an animation curve from another node. What would be the right expression to do this?</p>
","<p>There's not a built in method for that, but this Python expression will return the highest keyframe in an animation curve:</p>

<pre><code>max((key.y for key in nuke.toNode('Blur1')['size'].animation(0).keys()))
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>Blur1</code> is the node and <code>size</code> is the knob.</p>

<p>Paste this into your expression editor, being sure to select the <strong>Py</strong> toggle.</p>

<hr>

<p>This won't interpolate or extrapolate keys. It only iterates over every keyframe.</p>

<p>No guarantees on the speed of this either. It might bog down the node if you have a keyframe on every frame or something.</p>

"Audio noise reduction: how does audacity compare to other options?","848","","<p>Audacity's noise reduction filter is pretty good.  Before I use it, though, I want to know if I'm missing out on any fundamentally different approaches that may work better.</p>

<p>I have some recordings of my brother singing and playing piano.  It's pretty good as-is, but there's noticeable white noise.  There's also a 60Hz signal that's audible (but not really objectionable) during quieter portions of the recording.  Audacity does a pretty good job of getting rid of them.  So I'll almost certainly just use that, esp. since very recent audacity changes apparently have improved the noise-reduction filter.  (or maybe just the config UI?  I didn't look at the diffs).</p>

<p>The comments at the <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/audacity/source/browse/audacity-src/trunk/src/effects/NoiseReduction.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">start of the file</a> describes the design pretty well, and what the settings sliders mean (esp. the frequency smoothing was a mystery until I thought to check the source, and found it had a great comment describing the design.)</p>

<p>It gets a profile of the kind of noise you want to remove from a clip of only noise.  For the main pass, it FFTs the input, and silences every frequency bin that is below a threshold.  So it's a bandpass filter that adapts to only let through frequencies with signals above the noise level for that bin.  (Thresholds established from the noise profile.)</p>

<p>So my question is, are there other designs for noise filters that work any better?  Mostly out of curiosity, since audacity works very well for my application.  (noise energy distributed over a wide frequency range, signal I want to keep made up of fairly narrow frequencies.)</p>
","<p>After a bit of searching, I found <a href=""http://www.sonicscoop.com/2013/05/30/the-best-noise-reduction-plugins-on-the-market/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an article</a> surveying some of the commercial software noise reduction options.  For hiss/hum type noise removal (as opposed to crackles and pops), no approach other than noise-gates in multiple frequency bands was mentioned.  The differences between implementations are in the default settings, the control knobs available, and things like that.  (and whether the a noise sample is used to get a profile.  Apparently there are faster implementations that do well without needing a noise sample to build a tailored profile of the noise to remove.)</p>

<p>So AFAICT, Audacity's noise reduction plugin works the same way as commercial software implementations.</p>

<p>(For pops and crackles, Audacity allows making rectangular selections on the spectrum plot.  It might not have as sophisticated algorithms for filling in deleted glitches with similar-sounding audio from nearby, compared to some commercial software.  IDK, I haven't tried that.)</p>

<p>The other thing I was interested in was what's up with recent development activity in Audacity's Noise Reduction filter:</p>

<p>Following the svn history of <code>NoiseReduction.cpp</code>, there are really only changes to the GUI for setting parameters, from it's appearance in SVN r13591 (Nov 10, 2014) up to latest change in r13895 (Jan 24, 2015).</p>

<p>It replaces the over-optimistically-titled <code>NoiseRemoval.cpp</code>.  It appears to be a rewrite of the same basic design.  The intro comment describing the design is only slightly changed, and some of the same comments are kicking around in the code.  However, almost every line of code is different, and it's 1.9k lines of code instead of 870.</p>

<p>So it's probably not critical to get a pre-release build of Audacity 2.1 for noise removal.  If you get chimes / dropouts where you don't want them, or otherwise have problems, then go for a new version.  It looks at more data to decide if something is noise or not, as detailed below.</p>

<p>One critical part of the new filter now has several methods to choose from.  (<code>OLD_METHOD_AVAILABLE</code> is not enabled by default.  And <code>DM_DEFAULT_METHOD = DM_SECOND_GREATEST</code>)</p>

<p>(The code is well-commented.  I mostly just read the comments, on the assumption that the code matches well enough.)</p>

"How to link URL in flash media player to red5 server","848","","<p>I am trying to test a flash player for red5 live streaming video and in flash CS6 I have put a player component on the stage and not sure what url to input the live stream source?</p>

<p>I can test and see it working in mysite.com:5080/demos/publisher.html but cannot work out how to get that streaming video linked to my flash player.</p>

<p>update: it is not as simple as entering RTMP url as has failed on every attempt with all possible parameters and in any case the question now is what stops anyone from going to any given url with 5080 port and taking advantage...something to hash out in future with the help of mister AJ. </p>
","<p>I don't know this particular product, but based on what you are describing, I think this may help.  The player in flash probably wants the actual streaming media link.  When you go to the html page, you are accessing an HTML page that probably has an embedded player.  Flash streaming actually uses RTMP rather than HTTP, so you would need to find out what the RTMP URL is and provide that to the Flash video player.</p>

<p>Update: So to do a live stream, you need to use the rtmp link to the publishing point on your server.  You then need to use the publisher to send a feed to that publishing point.  Whatever name you provide in the publisher will be the name of the file that you need to feed to your viewer.  Everything gets relayed through the server.</p>

"ffmpeg and decklink- how to specify audio_input for hdmi video?","840","","<p>I'm using an Intensity Pro 4K to capture with <code>ffmpeg</code> via the <code>decklink</code> commands.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#decklink"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>video_input</strong></p>
  
  <p>Sets the video input source. Must be ‘unset’, ‘sdi’, ‘hdmi’, ‘optical_sdi’, ‘component’, ‘composite’ or ‘s_video’. Defaults to
  ‘unset’.</p>
  
  <p><strong>audio_input</strong></p>
  
  <p>Sets the audio input source. Must be ‘unset’, ‘embedded’, ‘aes_ebu’, ‘analog’, ‘analog_xlr’, ‘analog_rca’ or ‘microphone’.
  Defaults to ‘unset’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I set <code>-video_input hdmi</code>, which guarantees I will get the video via HDMI even if the Blackmagic driver is set to something else (e.g., component, which for some reason every time I reboot it gets reset to component).</p>

<p>But, while I get video, I don't get audio.  I tried setting <code>-audio_input</code> to <code>embedded</code> (no effect) <code>aes_ebu</code>, and <code>microphone</code> (not supported by device error).</p>

<p>So, I still have to go to the Blackmagic video drivers and switch the input signal to HDMI.</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify the hdmi audio feed together with the hdmi video feed on the ffmpeg command line?</p>

"What exactly do the sequence settings do?","837","","<p>Sooo, this may sound fairly stupid, especially for professional editors, but I'd like to know the role of the sequence settings in Premiere Pro. I know that the format of the preview files depends on the sequence settings, but apart from that, do they serve any purpose? I mean, regardless of the sequence settings, I can export my video to any format I want. So I'd e.g. like to know if it makes a great difference if I choose AVCHD 1080p25 or DSLR 1080p25 ...</p>
","<p>The entries for the creation of a new sequence are only presets.  They load things like pixel pitch, resolution, color depth, etc.  Many of these can be changed after creation, particularly if you haven't added anything to the timeline yet.  You can also make additional presets if you have frequent use of settings that there isn't already a preset for (or you can even manually select all the settings and not use a preset.)</p>

<p>This is the actual sequence settings:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UlueS.jpg"" alt=""Sequence Settings""></p>

<p>As you can see, the framerate(timebase), frame size, pixel pitch (aspect ratio), fields, display format, audio sample rate and audio display format make up the primary settings.  </p>

<p>There are additionally settings for how previews are rendered, which particularly matters if you intend to use previews in the rendering of final output, otherwise it just impacts what you see during editing (after preview renders have finished.)</p>

<p>While you can export in different formats, that will result in scaling if the resolution differs.  The sequence settings determine how the video renders, the export settings determine how the rendered frames are saved in to a final output.</p>

"File compatibility for Final Cut Pro 7 project files with Adobe Premiere Pro CS4","836","","<p>The video editing labs in my university have Final Cut Pro 7 installed on them, and most projects that we work on are done in FCP. I don't have a Macbook so I personally use Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 instead for my projects. Is there any way to transfer project files back and forth between the two software?</p>
","<p>Yes, in Premiere Pro, you can export to Final Cut XML. In Final Cut 7, you can export into an XML as well. Then you can import the XML files into each program.</p>

<p>The only problem is that Premiere on windows uses the AVI wrapper, and Final Cut 7 uses Quicktime. It might work going from Final Cut to Premiere. But going back into Final Cut probably will not work, as Final Cut does not like AVI. Also, the file paths will be different (but you can reconnect the media, but you are looking for an easy way).</p>

<p>Unless there is a software that does this, switching in between Programs and OS is going to take time.</p>

"Handbrake :: Why is an RF value of 20 to 23 recommended for HD while a lower value of 18 to 20 for SD?","836","","<p><em>This question is based on the software Handbrake.</em></p>

<p>Being a newbie to video editing/conversion and Handbrake, I understand that the RF values are used to select quality.</p>

<p>Lower the RF value, higher is the quality.</p>

<p>RF = 51 means fast encoding while very low quality.
RF = 0 means very very slow but lossless.</p>

<p>So from this logic it would mean that if I want to encode a 360p video for YouTube I would have to select <em>higher</em> RF value because it is lower quality and conversely, it I want a 1080p video then I must go for a <em>lower</em> RF value.</p>

<p>But Handbrake itself recommends RF=23 for HD and RF=18 for SD. How is this possible? I'm confused. </p>
","<p>Resolution != quality, at least, not in the sense referred to by RF. What the RF primarily modulates is the quantization parameter (QP).</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's say you have a 2x2 array of pixels and each pixel is represented by one floating-point value e.g. 3.98, 2.10, 1.05, 7.88. If your goal is to compress the video, then storing these values with full precision and fidelity will be more expensive than if you could store 4,2,1,8. Given the limitations of human vision, it turns out this is an acceptable compromise in the service of video compression. The greater the quantization parameter, the greater the 'smoothing out' of values. Such smoothing out reduces spatial detail i.e. sharpness and subtle color variation in the picture. Of course, this is just one strategy among the many used.</p>

<p>(The above is just a thematic illustration and not an example of the result of an actual quantization) </p>

<hr>

<p>Before RF, video encoders would apply a single QP across the entire video, so a scene with a lot of diversity of visual forms would have the same smoothing applied as a simple scene. If the degree of smoothing is low, the bitrate will shoot up in complex scenes. If it's high, it will degrade simpler scenes more than desired. What RF does is analyze the video content and modulate QP so that visual details appreciated by the human eye are not highly quantized but neglected details are. The RF value determines how much latitude the encoder has to vary the QP.</p>

<p>Now, to your question. A group of pixels, say a 16x16 block, forms a larger part of an SD image than of a HD image, so it will play a larger role in the subjective visual perception of the image (and have greater variation within), so you ought to smooth it out less.</p>

"When nesting clip, how to make new sequence same resolution as clip instead of original sequence?","832","","<p>The scenario is this: I have a standard HD resolution sequence, which I drop a 4k clip into. Later I decide I want to use Warp Stabilizer on that clip in the sequence, but I get an error message saying I need to nest the 4k clip in order to use stabilizer.  The easiest thing to do then is right click the clip and choose Nest...</p>

<p>The problem is that the newly created nest sequence uses the resolution of the original sequence, instead of matching itself to the 4k clip resolution. This means the Warp Stabilizer still won't work.</p>

<p>I can get a nested 4k sequence manually with a lot of steps, but is there a better way to achieve what I want?</p>
","<p>You can automatically create a sequence from a clip by right-clicking on it in the project panel and selecting ""New Sequence From Clip"". This will create a sequence matching the resolution and framerate of the clip and put the clip in it. You can drop the newly created sequence in your original sequence like any other asset in the project panel.</p>

"Encore CS6 ""DualLayer: This disc requires a layer break""","826","","<p>I am trying to create a dual-layer 8.5 GB DVD image.</p>

<p>So, my question is, how do I make this work, what are my options ?<br>
Is this issue because the 5.63 GB file cannot fit onto one layer (why would this even matter) ?</p>
","<p>It looks like it is not possible to create a DVD DL with a ROM part that exceeds a layer's size.</p>

<p>So I created a 4 GB HD video (which also fits on a FAT32 file system) and created a DL disc with some GBs wasted space.</p>

<p>I've not had much luck with lip-sync when doing this. I think there a problems with both decoding and re-encoding the GOP structure and the equivalent AAC or MPEG1 audio structures; but the underlying issue must be that the audio and video frame rates are not linked, e.g. 48 kHz for the audio and 29.97 fps.</p>

"Transitions in Premiere Pro CC 2015 with After Effects Sequence","814","","<p>I have two clips in Premiere, to which I want to add a black fade transition. So far that works without a problem.</p>

<p>But when I replace the clips with After Effects compositions (because I want to add some effects on the clips, like Twixtor) and then try to add a black fade transition between those clips (now AE compositions), it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Premiere tells me there are not enough frames for the transition, altough the clips are still the exact length, but only AE compositions...</p>

<p>What is the right workflow for doing stuff like this, so I will still be able to add transitions over the clips when they come back from After Effects?</p>
","<p>Often (and perhaps in your case) what is happening is the following.  Initially you have a clip that has plenty of content before or after your transition point.  You trim that clip to represent the content you actually care about.  If you do a fade at this point, the fade is going to use frames from the trimmed part of the clip that you don't necessarily see, but which are there (and which are used to complete the fade).  Now, if you send your trimmed clip through some external process, it doesn't send the /whole/ clip to the external process, just the frames you ""see"".  That clip that seems properly trimmed doesn't actually have the frames to allow the fade to complete the way you want it to.</p>

<p>To fix this, send a longer trim of the clip to AE, then, when it comes back, re-trim it to what you want.  You should find the fade working as well as it did for you initially.</p>

"Why does my Class 10 memory card run in to buffering problems?","814","","<p>My Canon EOS 600D's class 10 SD card does not write out data very quickly and this results in buffering issues which can be seen when shooting 1080p@30fps video.  Why can't the card keep up and what can I do to fix the problem?</p>
","<p>The class of a memory card often deals with the reading speed of the card, even if it should deal with the write speed.  It is relatively common for a card to have much quicker read times than write times, but since the read time is fast enough, they slap a faster class label on it than it can actually write.</p>

<p>You will need to get a class 10 card that actually has high speed writing in addition to high read speeds.  The best bet for checking this kind of thing is to read reviews of the cards and buy from reliable manufacturers that put the write speed in their spec.  The spec can be important since SD card makers will often change the actual storage chips used without changing the part number of the card.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I just discovered that about a minute of the output video just turned out black with the scene settings being exactly the same as the rest - anyone have a clue what that could be?</p>
","<p>It honestly looks like something got corrupted with your export.  Have you tried encoding it more than once?  12 megabits per second with a 24mpbs peak should be more than sufficient for high quality 1080p video.  If anything, it may be excessive.  The quality you are getting looks more like what I'd expect at sub-1 mbps video for this quality level.  As an aside, it is worth noting that 2 pass will produce better results, thought it will extend encoding time.</p>

<p>One other thought is to try watching it in more than one viewer.  It is possible that the viewer you are using is struggling to decode the high data rate fast enough which could also result in the block issues you are seeing.  Basically, it looks like some of the blocks in the H.264 file are not encoding or decoding properly and that either means file corruption or insufficient decoding speed.</p>

<p>I guess to rule out data rates, you could try increasing it to 30mbps with 45mpbs peaks.  It shouldn't have to be that high (that's the high end of bluray data rates), but it should rule out the data rate entirely.</p>

<p>Update: From some additional reading, I would try turning on 2-pass and turning on the deblocking filter.  It supposedly should help.</p>

"Can I use unlicensed music as soundtrack for a video?","808","","<p>I'm shooting a 1 min. promo video for an iPhone app startup. Can I use unlicensed music as long as I mention the artists on the closing credits? Are there any other resources available to help understand how copyright applies here?</p>
","<p>The short answer? <strong>No</strong>.</p>

<p>The long answer: No, copyright law requires you to have an appropriate licence from the copyright holders (usually the record label - not the artist - if they're in a record deal!)</p>

<p>There are three distinct rights for every piece of music:</p>

<ul>
<li>Phonogram copyright (the sound recording) (symbol: ℗, ""P"" in a circle)</li>
<li>Composition, score, artwork, cover design, lyrics, which can all be included in one overarching copyright registration per musical work (symbol: ©, ""C"" in a circle)</li>
<li>The Publishing right, considered separately by some</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these rights may be 'assigned' to a third party (e.g., a publisher or a record label) and this is what usually what happens when a track is released by a label. However you may be able to 'encourage' the artist to grant a licence for the music's use if the project is cool or they like it. Ultimately the person who has control of the sound recording copyright is the person to request a licence from.</p>

<p>You are in breach of copyright law if you use a copyrighted piece of music without a licence - moreso if you exploit that copyrighted composition for commercial gain (use it to represent the product or service, even if it's just background music). Whilst I think the current system of licensing music is crazy, that's just how it works for the time being.</p>

<p>Occasionally artists are willing to 'look the other way' if you agree a licence arrangement after the finished work using their copyrighted music is released -- this may not even be a cash payment, it may just be promotion with the band, song name and iTunes link at the bottom of the screen. However, arranging a license 'after the fact' still compromises you from a legal perspective, and you could be forced to stop using that music in your own work (and, worst case, be taken to court for copyright infringement) if the artist or label doesn't like it.</p>

<p>I concur with the other answerer's suggestion to seek Creative Commons licensed music; Jamendo is a good site to start on, and even if the initial license is CC-NC you can communicate with the artist to request a commercial use licence (or to be granted an exemption). You may also wish to try sites like YouLicense.com to seek appropriate sync licenses for music for a reasonable cost.</p>

"How do I edit video footage from an interview?","800","","<p>I was asked to produce a set of video interviews for a friend's wedding consisting of individual single-subject interviews (the interviewer is not on camera or mic) with the bride, groom, close family, and wedding party.</p>

<p>The questions were prepared, the lighting and scenery set up, the subjects miked for sound, the cameras positioned, the interviews conducted, and now I have a bunch of video files sitting on my hard drive.</p>

<p><strong>In short my question is, ""How do I edit together interview footage?""</strong> </p>

<p>To word it in more detail: My experience and background is weighted towards shooting video rather than editing it. I have access to all the software I might need and I know the basics of how to use it (Premier Pro, Sony Vegas), but I don't really know what I am doing. <strong>Is there a crash course in video editing, or possibly interview editing, that I could study to get started?</strong> Or quintessential interviews to watch? Or books to read?</p>
","<p>There is no one right way to edit anything. I've never watched a video of this kind so I probably can't give the best advice. But if I was in your position there are a few ways I'd consider cutting it together:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit it a bit like a 'behind the scenes' video. Begin with footage of someone talking and then use appropriate cutaways of the wedding. Cut back to different people whenever it is appropriate and put some music underneath, something that fits the mood.
This would be my preferred way but you'd need a fair amount of footage of the actual event and even some archival footage or photos would be very handy. Most movies have a behind the scenes on the DVD so I'd suggest watching one or two of those if this method sounds good to you. </li>
<li>The simplest way would be to show each interview one by one. So you'd show the first person's interview in its entirety followed by the next person's, and so on. Crossfade between them and have music underneath. This would probably be a boring video to watch in the end, but it'd do the job.</li>
<li>Similar to my previous suggestion, this would require only the interview footage (no event or archival footage). However, you'd intercut the interviewees based on topic. For example, if the bride talks about how she met the groom you'd intercut that along side the groom talking about how they met (assuming he does). This way you would be able to cut out a lot of the fluff that you get when interviewing people.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's how I'd go about it anyway, mate. Hope that helps you out a little. </p>

"after effects how to Zoom-in but keep same size (zooming and cropping)","799","","<p>I am using After Effects, i am zooming an image using two keyframes and the scale setting, but as i zoom in, the image gets bigger. </p>

<p>I want the image to have the zoom-in but keep its assigned size. So i want something like ""crop"" on top of the zoom.</p>

<p>How to do this?</p>
","<p>There are a couple of ways to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a <strong>track matte</strong>. Create a layer with the desired size / shape and put it above the zooming layer. You can use masks to create any shape you want, or use an image that has an alpha channel, or even just a copy of the original layer without the animated scale. On the zooming layer go to the Tack matte / mode panel (you may have to hit <kbd>f4</kbd> to toggle between switches and modes), and choose <strong>Alpha Matte ""layer name""</strong>. This will turn off visibility for the top layer, and apply its transparency to the layer below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/20E2J.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>Use a layer with the <em>stencil alpha</em> transfer mode above your original layer. This does a similar thing to a track matte, but it's not just for one layer, it's for every layer below the matte layer. And the visibility for the matte layer has to be on for it to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a preComp. Pre-comping replaces the original layer (or layers) with a composition containing just that layer(s). So you want to pre-comp the layer with the animated <strong>Scale</strong> property – select it and hit <kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> or choose <strong>Layer>Pre-Compose</strong> from the menu. In the dialogue that appears choose <em>move all attributes into the new composition</em>. Now you can add a mask to the pre-comp to crop off the scaled edges of the layer. A pre-comp is similar to what you'd get if you rendered the layer as a movie and then brought that back into your comp (but with a few advantages). As the pre-comp is not zooming, just its contents, the mask will crop the edges as the contents get bigger.

I understand that I will be giving up a lot of quality cropping the video to a small size but just having the ability of doing such a thing would be nice.</p>

<p>Programs to use:
- Blender
- After Effects CC
- Premiere Pro CC

","<p>Here's one way to do it. I'll assume you have basic motion tracking knowledge already for the sake of brevity. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Turn on 3D space for your footage layer. </p></li>
<li><p>Track the player in your footage. I'm going to guess that you'll have to do a lot of this by hand, but there's not really a faster way to track a player like this.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the track to a Null, including both X + Y values of course. Turn on 3D space for the null as well. </p></li>
<li><p>Create a Camera. Default values are fine. They will match your footage, so you initially won't see any change.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the Null and press P to open the position parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Here's the tricky part. Alt+Click on the Position stopwatch for your Camera. This will turn the position numbers red, open up an Expression text box, and reveal some new buttons. Click and drag the Pickwhip onto the Null's position parameter. </p></li>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsMFB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsMFB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your comp should go black. Good, it's working!</p></li>
<li><p>Open up the Position twirly for your footage layer (in my comp it's A037C006_160309CZ.MXF). The third value is the Z-depth. Adjust this to taste - the larger the number, the larger the resulting ""crop"" of your footage. Here I've set it to 1700 for a pretty extreme crop (and this is also 4K footage) - a more reasonable look, in my case, might be more like 2500. For you it will vary depending on the footage. </p></li>
<li><p>As you scrub through the timeline you should be perfectly locked onto the player. Unfortunately, depending on how close they get to the edge of the shot, you may see black appearing at the edge. This means you've ""cropped"" in far enough that you've hit the edge of the frame. You can reduce the crop (move the footage layer closer to the camera, a smaller number) as necessary to fix this. </p>

<ul>
<li>You may find that your track is a bit choppy. You can smooth it out a bit non-destructively using some of the techniques <a href=""https://forums.adobe.com/thread/465641"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">detailed here</a>.</li>

<p>BTW, I'm trying After Effects because iMovie was having a problem with my actress's blue eyes and blonde hair, both of which became partially transparent.  (I think the scene was lit fine, so her hair shouldn't have had green reflecting off of it.)</p>
","<p>Assuming the lighting is solid, you should be in good shape. I haven't used the keying features of iMovie, but I can give you a few tips for After Effects. I'll defer to any power users of AE's keying functionality to chime in with more specific advice.</p>

<p>First, you'll probably want to start with the Keylight plugin (from The Foundry). It should come bundled with After Effects Creative Cloud. There are tons of tutorials, guides, etc. for Keylight on the web.</p>

<p>Second, know that you can create masks with After Effects. Not sure if you're already familiar with them, but masks are custom shapes that allow for specific areas of footage to be visible or modified. Masks allow you to create a ""junk matte"" around your subject, which can be helpful if lighting gets a little uneven or equipment is visible on the edge of the shot. Masks could also allow you to preserve the actor's eyes so that they are not being keyed (especially if the shot is relatively static). For example, you might want to duplicate the main video layer, mask around the actor's eyes, then pull the key on the duplicated background layer.</p>

<p>Third, if you're still having problems with the hair after firing up Keylight, you'll want to look into the ""Despill Bias"" option. With despill bias, you'll basically select a skin color to reduce the blue / green bleeding. It might take a little trial and error.</p>

<p>For example, user sees video titled ""Welcome"" available to play. When he/she clicks to play that video, I take video files ""Opening.f4v"", ""Welcome.f4v"" and ""Ending.f4v"" and join/merge/concatenate them one after another to create one continuous video on the fly.</p>

<p>Resulting video looks like one video, with no visual clues, lags or even smallest observable delay between video parts.

"How to create exact copy of protected DVD?","779","","<p>First the explanation: I just bought some workout DVDs. My wife and I have a room in our house where we exercise, but my wife also works out with friends she dances with at her studio. I'd like to work out at home, and she'd like to be able to work out at her studio. </p>

<p>We could swap DVDs and try not to do the same workouts on the same days, but it would be easier if I could just copy the DVDs and she could just have those to herself. So my question is, how can I create an exact copy of the DVDs, complete with title menus, etc? I want the experience to be the exact same from the originals to the copies.</p>

<p>I've found a bunch of articles on this through Google, but they all seem to be centered on ripping. Furthermore, the few articles I've found about actually copying never mention whether the entire DVD will be copied (title menus, etc.. everything the same) or just the primary title (like the movie, but not extra features, etc.). I've messed around some with MakeMKV, and it seems to have ripped all the titles ok, but I don't know how to reconstruct them back into the original DVD.</p>

<p>I'm willing to pay for software that can do it. I really just need to know if this is possible, particularly with encrypted, protected DVDs.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Technicolor Cinestyle provide a .mga file to color correct the picture.  But I can't seem to find how to use that.</p>
","<p>The CineStyle picture style provides you with a flat, desaturated image: providing the best dynamic range of any of the picture styles for Canon DSLRs. Technicolor provide you with a file that you can apparently import into your editing software to help you grade your footage. However, I never figured out how to use it and frankly, I don't think one needs to. I think your time would be better spent learning how to color grade rather than learning how to import an .mga file. You don't need the file to grade your footage. I think it is more of a preset kind of thing – used to return the flat, desaturated image into a contrasty, attractive one albeit with more detail in the shadows and highlights than if you'd used any of the inbuilt Canon picture styles. However, this is something you can do yourself, and if done right, you will achieve better results than any preset can give you. </p>

<p>Most editing programs will have a color correction filter. Some programs have better than others but most should satisfy your needs.

When i see the recording sources in webcam I see either the laptop mic or the line in from focusrite audio interface. I choose line in from focusrite. The guitar recording happens but the effects from guitar rig don't get recorded.</p>

<p>Please suggest.</p>
","<p>The focusrite scarlet 2i2 has no inbuilt mic, you need to connect an ""external mic"" to it, or connect the guitar lineout to it. If you have effects pedals, just connect the last 1/4"" connector n the chain to the input of the Focusrite.</p>

<p>Please update why you are having sync problems. Anyway don't not rely on a webcam to give synced audio/video. I would say that if you record video &amp; audio from different sources, almost always you have to sync audio with video. Professional gear have a ""sync clock"" that makes it automatic but this is expensive. At less expensive level you have to work ""hard sometimes"" with sync. Having a good program like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere helps.</p>

"What software to use for lighting and rendering 3d animation shorts?","778","","<p>I am new to 3d animation. I have always wanted to make 3d animation shorts (cartoons) and have now made the plunge. Over the past few months I have learnt to model, rig and animate characters (Maya/zbrush). I want to take it a step further and learn lighting and rendering. After doing research for the past week, I have realised I have no choice but to ask here as several forum posts just mention that big studios use their own proprietary pipelines and softwares, while many indie-animators use all kinds of softwares from NUKE to after effects, V-ray to mental-ray. The thing is that people are using such software for all kind of VFX (like NUKE for live-action and v-ray for photo-realism). Can someone please guide me on the following questions:</p>

<p>For 3d/CGI animation shorts, what it the right lighting and rendering software to learn? </p>

<p>Do you recommend any tutorials out there that I can look at for those specific softwares? I do not want to be looking at a 10 hours video tutorial series on v-ray if they are teaching interior design lighting examples instead of how to light up a cartoon cgi animation. So unfortunately google has been unable to help me find specific tutorials on this.</p>

<p>I do not want to compromise on the quality so difficulty level and price of the software doesnt matter (not yet anyways).</p>
","<p>There seem to be a few basic misconceptions here.  For cartoons you don't need anything fancy as long as cell-shading is supported, which is typically a camera filter.</p>

<p>Lighting is actually done in your 3d animation software.  The job of a render engine like Mental Ray or V-ray is simply to process the scene you build to generate the final image, but it takes the geometry, light sources, materials, and cameras that you have defined in your animation software.</p>

<p>I'm personally a big fan of Mental Ray in general, but that's just because of the fact it is included with my 3d animation package of choice (SoftImage).  I thought it was included in most editions of Maya as well, but it might not still be.  I don't remember which render engines are included with Maya, but they should be more than sufficient for your purposes.  For cartoon rendering, you really don't need a hyper-accurate ray tracing engine that can do good physical simulation (which is the point of most of the third party render engines).</p>

<p>Lighting and rendering is also a complex and broad topic that can't really be covered in a couple of simple tutorials.  The basics are very similar to building your model, you just choose the types of lights you want and place them throughout the scene and then place one or more cameras to allow you to render viewpoints.  Lights and cameras can also be animated, just like your characters and scene.</p>

<p>Do your lighting in Maya and try rendering it out in Maya.  If you run in to any specific issues while working on trying to get the look you are going for, you can always post a screen shot here with a specific question and we should be able to offer more directed feedback about how to accomplish what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of videos we want to use but they're all in different formats and resolutions (Taken with different cameras over the years).  Some 720p, some 640x480, some MOV, some MPG, mp4, avi, etc, etc...  I am trying to get away with free on the video editing (VirtualDUB, Handbrake, etc...) so I am forced into using different tools to do different things.  Well in my experimenting I am finding that some video tools open mp4 and some don't.  Some open mov but most not.  I'd like to keep the videos as ""RAW"" as possible because they're all going to end up on a 40"" screen eventually.  So you can see where I want to lose as little resolution as possible in the conversions.  I like mp4 (H.264) because it's the format that my player (Roku 2 XS) requires, but there isn't much as far as free video editing tools that will open those video files.  What format should I convert everything into before I start doing my editing?</p>

","<p>I would recommend downloading the trial version of <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=premiere_pro"" rel=""nofollow"">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>, and cutting the videos together in there. The trial lasts 30 days which should be enough to get the job done..</p>

<p>Premiere Pro can take almost any file you throw at it (so you can leave all your videos in their original format). This way you wont be loosing any quality by converting your videos to one uniform codec before you edit. </p>

<p><strong>Otherwise</strong> as a completely free solution Id suggest converting all your videos to 1920x1080p h.264 files. Then you can bring them into iMovie or Windows Movie Maker to order and export one final file. </p>

<p>If you dont need the all the videos combined into one file (ie. if your player can play all the files on its drive continuously) then all you need to do is convert them to 1920x1080 h.264 files and load them on the drive. </p>

"How to handle extreme dynamic range in a vocalist?","772","","<p>Just finished a tracking session with a singer who has a <em>huge</em> dynamic range. This musician is otherwise very professional, and is a joy to have in the studio, and I'm not in any way criticizing her. However, there are some variables I'd like to know how to handle should they recur (with either her or another musician): </p>

<p>The was musician playing guitar while singing live in the studio. By the end of the session, we got the takes we needed, and their quality was good. She never needed more than a few takes, but we had to do a few retakes on top of that because of a little clipping. (But hey, six songs in three hours...not bad.) But this is making me wonder: </p>

<p>The extreme dynamic range makes using the pad setting problematic, coupled with a slightly noisy environment. (Read: lotsa planes and trucks today in my normally quiet neighborhood.) </p>

<p>In general, what can one do to cope with a situation like this? Should the tracking engineer ride the trim pot in a situation like this, or would that make the recording choppy? Suck it up and use automation and light compression on the audio in post? Run a second mic for the vocal?</p>

","<p>What Kim Burgaard said is very true. The vocalist has a lot of control over how their voice is recorded. As I'm a much inferior vocalist to those I record, it can be difficult teaching them this technique, as you just want to get a good take.</p>

<p>So what I end up doing is have the vocalist scream. Well, I ask them to warm up and hit the loudest levels they can. I then adjust via that. I try not affect overall sound with compression in the analog domain. With the takes in 24bit, I can use envelopes or a compressor in the mixing stage.</p>

<p>I would stay away from ridding the level during recording. It's more difficult to get the levels right in the mixing stage.</p>

<p>You mention running a second mic for the vocal. I would hope that is what you are doing anyway. I don't think recording the mic and guitar with one mic is a good idea at all. You'll not be able to mix anything.</p>

I'm such a dumb dumb. I had all these people trying to figure out why my files were .OGG. They weren't. They were .VOB. What was on the DVDs is exactly what Perter Cordes described below. Now that I've sent people on a wild goose chase...</p>

"How to live stream 4 cameras to a flat screen TV","760","","<p>I wanted to live stream different views from 4 cameras at the same time on a flat screen TV or monitor. What materials would I need for such a project. I have seen home security surveillance setups in which 4 cameras are streamed live to a monitor, however two things that are very important to this project are:</p>

<p>1.) live stream quality</p>

<p>2.) monitor size (need ~50inch display)</p>

<p>3.) placement of stream views on display</p>

<p>If there are surveillance packages that accomplish these goals (especially flexible positioning of the 4 live stream views), feel free to point me to them. Also, I am new to this website so If this question is not a good fit for this thread, then where would it be a good fit? Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>You need something like the Blackmagic Multiview: <a href=""https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/multiview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/multiview</a> or Matrox Quad-Split <a href=""http://www.matrox.com/video/en/products/microquad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matrox.com/video/en/products/microquad/</a> or Decimator MD-QUAD <a href=""http://decimator.com/Products/MultiViewers/MD-QUAD%20Quad-Split%20MultiViewer/MD_Quad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://decimator.com/Products/MultiViewers/MD-QUAD%20Quad-Split%20MultiViewer/MD_Quad.html</a></p>

<p>These units take HD-SDI input and can then display it on a HDMI (or SDI) display however you like.</p>

<p>So grab as many cameras as you need - you can decide what quality camera suits your needs. Get cameras with with SDI output for long cable runs. If they don't have SDI, you can get HDMI to SDI converters. If an SDI cable isn't long enough, you can get SDI/HDMI to Fibre converters that let you run fibre optic cable between your cameras and a multiview. </p>

<p>Any half decent multiview will let you use a computer to re-arrange the placement of the images on the screen.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"What determines video orientation (landscape or portrait) during playback?","759","","<p>I captured a short video on my Android phone in portrait mode (i.e. to be viewed vertically).  When I played it on Windows 7 using WMP (or VLC), it displayed incorrectly in landscape orientation.</p>

<p>Thinking that I had to rotate it, I transferred the video to a Windows 10 laptop to process in After Effects.  To my surprise, I found out that it plays in the correct portrait mode on Windows 10 (using whatever is the default player that comes with Windows 10), and also plays correctly when imported into After Effects, requiring no rotation.</p>

<p>What determines how a video is oriented during playback?</p>
","<p>If the video is meant to be played in a different orientation than its stored representation, then a rotation flag is set in the stream metadata. A compliant player uses that tag and rotates the video during playback.</p>

<p>A tool like <a href=""https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mediainfo</a> will display that data (if specified) like here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vJDI8.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vJDI8.jpg"" alt=""Mediainfo rotate tag""></a></p>

<p>A tool like ffmpeg can reset the tag. Of course, you'll also want to rotate the video stream as currently stored so it plays in the correct orientation after the tag has been reset. ffmpeg's transpose filter can do that.</p>

<p>I would like to get opinions on a HuffYUV workflow, possible drawbacks and a complete installation guide with suggested settings to use, thanks!</p>
","<p>They do on Windows, you need to use the AVI container as HuffyUV isn't available as a quicktime codec, afaik.</p>

<p>I used huffyUV for a while, but have switched to <a href=""http://www.magicyuv.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">magicYUV</a> which has a better range of colour space support (including 10-bit in beta).  <a href=""http://www.videohelp.com/software/Ut-Video-Codec-Suite"" rel=""nofollow"">UTVideo</a> is another good option and is available for mac.</p>

<p>With the Premiere - After Effects - Media Encoder workflow I find that exporting to a flattened movie only happens when I am making the final master, I use Dynamic Link for the intermediate transfers from say AE to Premiere. As well as saving disk space it's faster and easier because you can make changes and have them update on the fly.</p>

<p>So for final masters these lossless codecs are great, with the one caveat–they may not be supported in the long term. Mostly they are developed by small teams or even a single person, so if they get a full-time job or have twins the project might tank. If you're making masters that need to be available for the long term – as in decades, then FFV1 is a good option, though for everyday use as an intermediate codec it's a bit slow.</p>

","<p>Edit your footage in one timeline, with the sequence setting set to the combined dimensions of all the screens (so the width of one screen across × three times the height). So if they're 1080p screens you'll be looking at 1920 × 3240.</p>

<p>Now make three sequences, each with the resolution of one playback screen, e.g 1920 × 1080. Take your original sequence and lay it into these timelines (as a nested sequence).</p>

<p>Adjust the motion properties of the clip in the first sequence so that the top of the clip lines up with the top of the frame, then in the next sequence align the middle of the clip with the middle of the frame and in the last sequence align the bottom of the clip with the bottom of the frame.</p>

<p>Now you have three sequences that align as you wish. The beauty of nesting the combined sequence is that you can make changes without having to synchronise three separate sequences.</p>

"Is there a low-cost automated pan/tilt/zoom system?","752","","<p>Our church wants to install a video camera to record services and sermons, nothing fancy - here's what I'm thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mount a remote-control pan/tilt head on the wall or railing of the balcony</li>
<li>During the service, attach a video camera that has remote-control zoom/start/stop control</li>
<li>Have software that lets the operator hit buttons that say ""pan/tilt/zoom so the camera is pointing at the pulpit"" or ""pan/tilt/zoom so the camera shows the entire altar area"".</li>
</ol>

<p>The challenge, of course, is that we don't have $5000 to spend on one of the fancy commercial systems (nor do we need something that sophisticated).</p>

<p>We have a Canon VIXIA HF-R52 that you can control remotely (zoom/start/stop), and I'm considering the Panasonic CTR-1 Remote Pan Tilt Cradle, what I can't tell is whether the controls for either let you say ""go to zoom level 8.3, pan 20 degrees from center and 30 degrees down from horizontal"" (which is what I would need, in order to give the operator a button for ""pan/tilt/zoom to the altar"".</p>

"Are the properties (bitrate, fps) of my h.264 video OK for the web?","737","","<p>I'm converting a Flash vector animation to an mp4 video for the web.

<p>When exporting a FLA to MOV, the frame rate changes. For example, an 18 fps FLA comes out as 9.6 fps in the MOV (according to the QT player properties).</p>

<p>Because the animation is jittery, I used Handbrake to export the MOVs as h.264, with framerates of 24, 30 and 60. They look smoother. (I was surprised the time-length of the video doesn't change, I thought at higher framerates it'd speed up). </p>

<p>Anyway, an mp4 produced like this has the following properties (according to the QT player):</p>

<p>My newbie question is: can anyway tell me, at a glance, whether those properties are within the normal range for a video that is meant to be served from a dedicated web server or CDN? </p>
","<p>Sure - it seems ok. However, it is also a good idea to offer other types of video for browsers that do not support mp4 / h264. The usual best practice involves supplying mp4, webm and ogg as containers. <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/"" rel=""nofollow"">This site is a good reference.</a></p>

<p>A back of the napkin calculation:</p>

<p>1000 viewers / month @ 7.4 MB = 7.4 GB / Month.</p>

<p>Which is probably within the acceptable range for a generic server, just make sure the traffic allowed by your server provider can deal with it...</p>

<p>Assuming your server has a gigabit uplink (which is generally a bit more expensive), you could ""theoretically"" serve this video to 5000 users concurrently, however this won't work with normal apache servers - and it is probably a good idea to host the media files at amazon AWS (or whatever) if you are expecting that kind of traffic.</p>

"How to apply an offset to one axis only in 3D space for linked expression position?","735","","<p>I have a 3D position property linked with another composition. I want the z-axis to have an offset in the linked expression. But how can I apply an offset just to one axis?</p>

<p>The current expression of the 3D position:</p>

<pre><code>comp(""Main COMP"").layer(""text"").transform.position
</code></pre>
","<p>The position property is an array, which is a container with a number of components in it, in this case the three position values: x, y and z. To specify an array you use this notation <code>foo = [A,B,C]</code> where A, B and C are the individual values – constants, variables, whatevs. <strong>TL;DR</strong> to create an array you put a number of comma-separated values in square brackets.</p>

<p>Conversely you can access any of the components of an array using this notation: <code>foo[n]</code> where foo is the name of the variable, and <code>n</code> is the <em>index</em> of the component you want. <strong>Note that the index starts at 0</strong>, so to get the first component of the array you would use <code>foo[0]</code>, the second <code>foo[1]</code> and so on. Arrays can also be multi-dimensional, so the address could be <code>foo[0][5][99]</code> for a three dimensional array. But you probably don't need to worry about that at this point.</p>

<p>In your case you want just the third component to have the offset. So you need to unpick the original array using the <code>foo[0]</code>, <code>foo[1]</code>… notation and then put it back together as an array using the <code>[A,B,C]</code> notation. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>thePos = comp(""Main COMP"").layer(""text"").transform.position;
[thePos[0], thePos[1], thePos[2]+offset]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>offset</code> is whatever your offset is, obviously.</p>

<p>The first line is just for convenience - it assigns the position property as the value of the variable myPos. You could do it all on one line, but it gets a bit hard to read:</p>

<pre><code>[comp(""Main COMP"").layer(""text"").transform.position[0], comp(""Main COMP"").layer(""text"").transform.position[1], comp(""Main COMP"").layer(""text"").transform.position[2]+offset]

<p>I plan on using Adobe Premiere for any editing of the uncompressed footage and then for motion graphics / animation using After Effects. </p>

<p>My question is, how can I keep the format consistent, interlaced fields, across different applications and also what output format should be used for the final video / deliverables.</p>

<p>Can I apply my editing and motion graphics like normal with progressive, but @ 60 frames/sec, then at the very end export a rendered video that is 1080i?</p>
","<p>You're not going to be able to replicate the precise ""look"" of 59.94, even with special plugins. This, due to the fact that interlaced is in many ways like:</p>

<p>Double Frame Rate - Half Resolution. </p>

<p>Think of 59.94i at 1080 really as 119.88 at 540p. </p>

<p>Interlaced lines are scanned odd lines first, then even. So you technically have a first set of lines which are actually one frame, with the other set of lines missing. These lines are then displayed back to the viewer odd/even//odd/even//odd/even etc. </p>

<p>That said, you get smoother motion with i vs p. You are able to achieve better slow motion in post production with i vs p, however, p, is of course the preferred format to most. A single frame being a single frame. </p>

<p><em>NOW THAT SAID...</em></p>

<p><strong>Looks aside,</strong> in order to output your video from PPro, all you will simply want to do is import the footage material in (original); right mouse click; new sequence from clip; make any edits/trims, etc. </p>

<p>It is really unnecessary to make any additional adjustments from the timeline in Premiere, because what you ultimately want to do is use <strong>Frame Blending</strong> when you export.</p>

<p>After you've made any adjustments, go to export, choose the format you need; 59.94i, whatever codecs they are requiring, many are already built in; others may need to be downloaded. </p>

<p>Ensure you turn on Frame Blending, IF your source material is progressive. </p>

<p>Frame Blending will force interpolation of the frames during the rendering of your new video outputs, using two side by side discreet progressive frames to create a new ""quasi"" interlaced frames, twice as many frames as your progressive source at the correct frame rate. </p>

<p>It isn't quite the same ""look"" wise as actual Interlaced source material; however, specification wise it should meet their needs; and to the average viewer most will not notice. </p>

<p>Do not however use Frame Blending if you are using Interlaced material. And do not double the effect by applying it to the clip in the timeline (which you can do by right clicking the clip; Under Frame Blending/Field Options); and then stack it with another Blend on export. Only one is necessary, and my recommendation is simply allow Adobe Media Encoder handle the p to i conversion. </p>

<p>Lastly, if you have material at lower resolution, AME will be upscaling it to get to 1080. If so, you can use the Use Maximum Render Quality Checkbox at the bottom of the export panel window. </p>

<p>Be advised this will likely increase your rendering time by multiple fold. </p>

<p>In regards to the audio; they have peaking requirements. You will need to apply a Dynamics and/or Limiter filter in the Audio Mixer Window Filter Dropdown. Limit to the specifications they have stated. </p>

<p>In regards to center safe, if you're given material that isn't center safe, you're going to need to talk with them about that, as you'll have to do a push in and do manual pan and scan using the motion filter, adjusting the frame position on the canvas to get it to 4:3 safe. </p>

<p>This is also repeated in the realtime capture section help when talking about an optional re-encoding with a slower preset to try saving some size:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note that since the initial recording was lossless, and the re-encode is lossless too, no quality loss is introduced in this process in any way.</em></p>

<p>note: even if I have accepted the answer for general purposes I tend to use the soluction provided by @paul-b-mahol with the <strong>libx264rgb</strong> encoder.</p>

<hr>
","<p>It's an artifact of the player, not the encoder.</p>

<p>I used the command below to generate a RGB format capture in HuffYUV</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f dshow -video_size 1920x1080 -framerate 30 -i video=""screen-capture-recorder"" -c:v huffyuv -t 5 cap.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>Then transcoded the file to</p>

<p>x264 lossless RGB</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i cap.mkv -c:v libx264rgb -crf 0 -preset ultrafast h264rgb.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>HuffYUV YUV 4:2:2</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i cap.mkv -c:v huffyuv -pix_fmt yuv422p huffyuv.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>x264 lossless YUV 4:2:2</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i cap.mkv -c:v libx264 -crf 0 -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv422p h264yuv.mkv
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Then, using the SSIM metric, compared the HuffYUV and x264 RGB files</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i h264rgb.mkv -i cap.mkv -filter_complex ssim -f null -
</code></pre>

<p>which resulted in</p>

<pre><code>SSIM R:1.000000 (inf) G:1.000000 (inf) B:1.000000 (inf) All:1.000000 (inf)
</code></pre>

<p>And the HuffYUV and x264 YUV files</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i h264yuv.mkv -i huffyuv.mkv -filter_complex ssim -f null -
</code></pre>

<p>Result</p>

<pre><code>SSIM Y:1.000000 (inf) U:1.000000 (inf) V:1.000000 (inf) All:1.000000 (inf)
</code></pre>

<p>So, x264 does produce lossless output.</p>

"What setup do I need to record and render at the same time?","728","","<p>I need help figuring out how to record while my computer is rendering.</p>

<p>I am very new to video editing, so this is my current workflow.  First, I record footage using Fraps (30 fps, 1080p, .avi). I usually get several hours worth.  Then I use Adobe Premiere CC and Media Encoder to cut the video into 20 minutes chunks. I queue all the videos up in Media Encoder (h.264, mp4, 1080p, 30fps).</p>

<p>Each video takes about 30 minutes to render (intel 2600k. dual amd 6950s, 16 gb ram). My source video is on a 2 TB HDD and the destination is a separate 1 TB HDD.</p>

<p>Here is my problem.  While rendering, the computer can't be used for much else since my CPU usage is capped.  My GPU doesn't seem to be used at all (as I understand, h.264 encoding is almost all CPU based).</p>

<p>How can I change my setup so that I can record more video while the machine is rendering away? In addition to my PC, I have a NAS available, a Macbook Retina Pro (2012, 16gb ram), and two external HDD cages. I think I need to come up with a setup where I can record on one machine and render with the other, but I don't know if this is viable or which HDD to record video to in that situation (is recording to NAS common? or do I make the other computer's HDD a share drive? record to external drive and move it around?) </p>

<p>There are a lot of unknowns for me here and I would just like to know what a ""normal"" setup is for using one computer to record and another to render.  I am on a gigabit LAN with my NAS and laptop, but the laptop only has wireless connectivity.</p>

<p>I would just render my videos over-night, but that is when I upload to Youtube, as that takes many hours. </p>
","<p>Don't, just don't.  File access is your primary problem.  You can offset this by using SSDs, but the much more practical solution is to either upgrade to gigabit connectivity between two systems or use high speed external drives to move content captured on one system to the other system and then run the encoding completely distinctly.</p>

<p>Capturing footage on a system running a game is already a very difficult thing to do as both the file capture and the game engine put a lot of demand on the system.  Adding a third major demand of system resources is asking for trouble.  The main reason that files are so large from video game screen captures is that very little compression is applied.  Video games don't use much disk resources (outside of loading levels) but they do use a lot of CPU and GPU.  So screen capture tools for games put off CPU and GPU intensive tasks at a cost of disk utilization.</p>

<p>The problem is that encoding is going to make use of both disk utilization and CPU and GPU resources.  The CPU and GPU utilization will interfere with the game engine and the disk utilization will interfere with capture unless they are on a completely separate pool of resources on a different machine.  It is possible to segment resources off in some cases, but you'd still be substantially impacting the capability of your system and reducing the quality of capture and gameplay it could achieve.</p>

"How to Record a Dark scene without any Noise?","726","","<p>I am using Nikon D3200, I am trying to shoot a dark scene. The scene is so dark and there is minimal amount of light. I am shooting in manual mode and these are my settings. ISO 200, f/5.2, Shutter Speed 1/50.</p>

<p>With all these settings i am getting so much noise in the scene. Kindly tell me how to avoid noise in the Dark Scene.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Taha<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGvJo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>With low light levels your brightest signal will be close to the noise floor, so you only really have three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>a camera with better low light performance (although this can only take you so far)</li>
</ul>

<p>More expensive sensors can give a lower noise floor, allowing you to resolve more detail</p>

<ul>
<li>a faster lens</li>
</ul>

<p>As Jason commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the widest aperture on your kit lens is 4.0, then you could double the amount of light your camera sees by purchasing an f2.8. Every additional ""stop"" doubles the light, so if you could find an f1.0, you'd be getting 16 times the light that f4.0 allows.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>more light</li>
</ul>

<p>Your easiest option may be just to increase the illumination and then reduce brightness in post. Remember that if you do this, you also need to watch for shadows that look too sharp.</p>

"Blur a face using only one video layer with Premiere CS6?","717","","<p>so with the new built-in masking option of the gaussian blur and similar effects in the CC version of Premiere Pro it's pretty easy to limit effect to a specific area of the video in order to e.g. blur a face. However, I'm searching for an easy and <strong>easily comprehensible</strong> way to achieve this effect in CS6 without duplicating the clip to a second video layer (video lane?) and using the gaussian blur in combination with a track matte key (which is what I used to do in Premiere Pro CS6).
So, is there a way to blur a face without duplicating the clip to a second video layer in the CS6 version?
(Unfortunately, I only have the current CC version at my disposal right now, so I can't try it out myself at the moment.)
Thanks a lot!</p>
","<p>Yes and no, you can do it without duplicating the clip, but not without a second layer.  Instead of using a second copy of the clip, you can use an adjustment layer.  You make a new adjustment layer by creating a New Item in the Project window.  You add that adjustment layer over top of the video you want to adjust and then you apply your masking to the adjustment layer and apply your effects to the adjustment layer.</p>

<p>The effects applied to the adjustment layer are then applied to the sum total of all the layers below the adjustment layer.  Effectively, the adjustment layer is a layer that is composed of a sub-render of everything below it and then has the set of effects applied to it applied to that sub-render.</p>

<p>It technically isn't adding two copies of the sequence, but practically it is still doing the same thing.  I'm not personally aware of any more straightforward technique than that for doing what you describe in CS6 though.  That doesn't necessarily mean much though as I normally do this kind of thing in AE anyway, so my experience doing it in Premiere is limited at best (bordering on non-existent.)</p>

","<p>Some things to be aware of when shooting video (this applies to most DSLRs):</p>

<h1><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rolling Shutter</a></h1>

<p>Because of the way the 550d records each frame you can end up with <a href=""http://youtu.be/GMENDJdzlf0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">slanted video</a> when combined with fast motion. This is because the camera recordes each frame line by line, so each line is recorded at a slightly different time causing a warped effect. Its not a problem for normal motion, but if you are doing moves like panning the camera quickly you will see the effect.</p>

The important thing to remember if you choose this method is to make sure you still have internal recording enabled on the 550d because you will need it as reference audio (there is never really any good reason to NOT record the internal audio, its always useful as a reference even if you dont intend on using the audio)</p>

<h3>2.  Built-in Recording</h3>

<p>The camera has a compressor built in so anything you plug into the line in jack will be running through the cameras compressor. The issue that can come from this is clipped audio if your audio suddenly jumps up in volume. <a href=""http://mattthomasfilm.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/recording-sound-with-your-550d.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a good article</a> going over recording sound specifically with a 550d and ways to avoid having your audio clipped. </p>

<h1>Memory &amp; Recording Time</h1>

<p>A common problem with almost all the Canon DSLRs (not sure about the new ones coming out) is that they can only record around 12 minutes at a time. In my experience the amount is never exact. Its not a problem for any fictional work because its rare you would be shooting for longer than a few minutes at a time, but for documentary work (eg interviews) this can be a problem!</p>

<p>Its worth testing your memory cards before you shoot with them, I've had many experiences where some cards will record fine and others will stop recording after 5-15 seconds. Its always worth getting higher class memory cards which allow for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#Speed_Class_Rating"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">faster transfer rates</a>. Class 6 or Class 10 is often the standard choice for video recording (though the higher the class, the higher the price!)</p>

<h1>Batteries</h1>

<p>Shooting video chews through the battery life. For a single days shoot you would be very lucky if you didn't use more 3-4 batteries. Its always a good idea to have at least two batteries (ideally 3). That way when your battery dies you can use the spare battery while the other charges. But I wouldnt rely on this, sometime it takes longer for the battery to charge and you may not always have access to power depending on your location.</p>

<h1>Good Resources</h1>

"Amateur orchestra recording/post-processing","712","","<p>I play in an amateur university orchestra, and I just recorded our last concert this weekend. This was a very simple setup: just a Sony PCM-D50 recorder, set to record at 96/24 through its internal mics, on a tripod a couple of meters away from the orchestra.</p>

<p>I set the recording level low enough that the internal limiter never triggered, while getting peaks at around -3 dB when the orchestra was really loud (and 0 dB during applause, of course).</p>

<p>Now with an orchestral program (especially in this case where we played movie soundtracks, so you get a solo violin in Schindler's List, a small woodwind ensemble in Harry Potter (Nimbus 2000 theme), and full-tilt brass/percussion in Star Wars) there is an enormous dynamic range to cover. It seems that modern productions use heavy dynamic range compression to ""lift"" the soft passages, and while I'm quite happy with the sound quality of the recording as-is, I'd still like to try and ""equalize"" it a bit so it's more in line with other CDs.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I use the pre-set Dynamic range compression settings in Sound Forge Audio Studio (for example 2:1 compression from -18 dB, or 3:1 from -15 dB) and then add gain (say, +6 dB), I find that the recording starts sounding quite muddy.</p>

<p>I don't think that that's because of a bad algorithm (I find the same problem in Audacity) but probably because I'm using a sledgehammer instead of a fine screwdriver to adjust the sound. Do you have any tips on how to lift low volumes without muddying the middle dynamic and high peaks?</p>
","<p>The real answer: make sure your input level is OK every time you record something. Make sure that the loudest passages are just hitting the head (I try getting to > -1dB FS while not clipping.) , so the soft passages have enough detail. Also remember that dynamic range is a musical ingredient in classical music, even between different pieces. If things are soft in the hall, you don't want them as loud in your recording as things that are loud in the hall, you will lose a bit of musicality.</p>

<p>So: never ever compress classical music to solve your dynamic range problems, unless you use it for professional broadcasting purposes only. (And even then, don't compress the master, but use compression in the broadcasting chain.)</p>

<p>Instead, if you still want to fix things because you are turning the volume up and down between the pieces: slightly adjusting the overall levels of the pieces a bit is in many occasions the right thing to do. To do this, edit all pieces so that they fade in and out on the beginning and the end. (With a piece, I mean, if you record a Beethoven symphony, those 4 movements are related, so only fade the beginning of the first movement in, and the applause at the end of the last movement out. Don't fade in between the movements and don't adjust the volume for the individual movements!) If you do this, you can make slight adjustments to the overall level of the pieces. Don't normalize to 0dB FS though, and don't make the changes too big. A few (e.g. 3) dB could just be enough to solve your problem.</p>

<p>If you want to go this path, make sure you always record in 24 bits so you have more detail in your audio if you increase the volume in the master. (Sample rate is of less importance, but to record in 96KHz or in 88.2KHz is always good.)</p>

<p>My personal tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjusting the volume of a classical mix changes the accoustics of the hall; all sustaining noise from e.g. the audience is louder as well as the reverb it creates.</li>
<li>Adjusting the volume of a classical mix/master is almost always an excuse for having too much headroom on your recording and will result in dynamic detail getting lost. Therefore, always record in 24 bits if you decide to increase it.</li>
<li>As mentioned: dynamic range in classical music is a piece of the music itself, even between the different pieces. Getting rid of it is destroying part of the musical contents.</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb: never touch the volume of a part of a classical recording if the difference in dynamics is so bad that you can't listen to the recording in the living room without touching the volume button.</li>

"Green screen without green screen","707","","<p>Is it possible to, rather than a green screen, take a static shot of a background image (e.g. for a Skype call with a fixed-position webcam), and use this static image as the green screen?</p>

<p>So, I would take a photo of my sitting room through the cam, and then be able to use that image as my ""green screen"".</p>
","<p>Yes, that is possible. What you're searching for is a <strong>difference matte</strong> / <strong>difference key</strong>. For that technique, you supply a base image and the program keys everything out that equals that image. So you could key out your static background so that only you remain in the picture.</p>

<p>However, there are a few downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li>This technique doesn't work nearly as good as a greenscreen. It will probably require a lot of work and there will still be some artifacts left in the video.</li>
<li>If you're using a bad camera (such as a laptop webcam), the result will be even worse.</li>
<li>If you move your camera even slightly, you'll have a problem. So if you do that with a webcam, don't touch it at all, if possible.</li>
<li>There probably aren't many applications that can do this effect live (as opposed to post-production). IIRC, there is some video chat app for Mac-Computers that can do this. I'm not sure if it is possible with Skype, you'll have to research that. However, keep in mind that it probably won't look as good as you imagine it.</li>

<p>The above picture sums up my problem. I'm struggling to work out what settings to put my camera on to work with my strobe light. I vaguely understand the problem; that the camera takes pictures row by row, so the lighting has changed by the time it gets to the bottom half. But I can't work out how to fix it. I would have thought that a very fast shutter speed would help, but apparently not.</p>

<p>The camera is a Fujifilm X-E1 and the strobe light is a cheap model with a rotary dial to change the speed. It doesn't have DMX control.</p>
","<p>What you're seeing is an inherent problem with sensors that use ""rolling shutter"". There are tradeoffs in sensor technology among speed, sensitivity, and size, and using a sequential line readout with continuous exposure is a popular choice that's a good compromise for many situations. Unfortunately yours isn't one of those.</p>

<p>What you need is what's known as ""total"" or ""global"" shuttering, where the entire frame is exposed at once and read out as a single image. Instead you have a sensor that essentially exposes each line of the array at different times.</p>

<p>So I'm afraid the answer is: use a camera / sensor that employs a different technology. I hope for your sake someone has a solution that allows you to use your existing setup, but I don't expect to see one.</p>

"What is the correct MPEG-2 FourCC?","705","","<p>In my attempts to encode a video to MPEG-2 in an MOV (which seems to be a valid combination, at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_container_formats"" rel=""nofollow"">according to Wikipedia</a>), using ffmpeg (<code>-vcodec mpeg2video</code>) and other tools, I have become extremely confused about the FourCCs as well as seemingly related limitations on container formats. I have found:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>m2v1</code>: This is the default FourCC used by ffmpeg when encoding MPEG-2, but it is unplayable in all media players I have tried (VLC, Windows Media Player, mplayer, and QuickTime Player). It also does not seem to exist in any FourCC databases I have found. Forum posts are rare and are related to old Mac software and compatibility problems regarding this code.</li>
<li><code>mp2v</code>: I can force this code with ffmpeg. It is then playable in all common media players. However, MPEG-2 videos encoded with other encoders (such as Handbrake or Prism), to AVIs, do not use this code, they use <code>mpgv</code>, which makes me suspicious.</li>
<li><code>mpgv</code>: I can force this code with ffmpeg as well, but only when outputting to an AVI (and Handbrake uses it too but only outputs Matroska and MP4). Ffmpeg fails when I attempt to output MOV. Forum posts also indicate trouble with the <code>mpgv</code> + QuickTime container combination.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm very confused. Why are there different FourCC's for this, what is the correct one to use, how is it related to the container and, at the end of the day, if I want an MPEG-2 in an MOV what do I do?</p>

<p>I guess by ""correct"" in the title I mean compatible with the most common players; least likely to cause problems for normal people with stock software.</p>

<p>As a sub-question, VLC describes <code>mpgv</code> and <code>mp2v</code> as ""MPEG-1/2 Video"". So, if I see a video with FourCC <code>mpgv</code>, is it MPEG-1, or is it MPEG-2? I suspect my lack of understanding of how all the MPEG versions are related to each other is coming into play here.</p>
","<p>Strictly speaking, <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/ms922669.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">fourcc</a> is the codec ID used by Microsoft. It has been adapted for use with many other formats, thus making it seem like a standardized ID format, but it's not.</p>

<p>ffmpeg, in particular, seems to only consider XDCAM standard MPEG2 for inclusion in MOV.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/6e249466cc6bd5b17d6e8cbd9a84a636cc92fd60/libavformat/movenc.c"" rel=""nofollow"">source code</a>:</p>

<pre><code>else if (track-&gt;enc-&gt;codec_id == AV_CODEC_ID_MPEG2VIDEO)
    tag = mov_get_mpeg2_xdcam_codec_tag(s, track);

<p>where if the xdcam tag function doesn't find a matching XDCAM stream, it runs</p>

<pre><code>if (!tag)
    tag = MKTAG('m', '2', 'v', '1'); //fallback tag
</code></pre>

<p>which ffmpeg, interestingly, <a href=""https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/979572365f2133f969f3f49ec6a99cc8739d2eba/libavformat/isom.c"" rel=""nofollow"">thinks</a> is tha tag that should be used for recording MPEG-2 in a MOV by a camera.</p>

<pre><code>{ AV_CODEC_ID_MPEG2VIDEO, MKTAG('m', '2', 'v', '1') }, /* Apple MPEG-2 Camcorder */ 
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>mp2v</code> is signalled as required for (an old version of) Final Cut Pro.</p>

<pre><code>{ AV_CODEC_ID_MPEG2VIDEO, MKTAG('m', 'p', '2', 'v') }, /* FCP5 */
</code></pre>

<p><code>mpgv</code> is not on that (ISO media) list that the MOV muxer can be forced to work with, but it is on the <a href=""https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/11bc4fd653fab05a9e24f7aca22c913ffb238b5a/libavformat/riff.c"" rel=""nofollow"">RIFF list</a> (for AVIs) where it's only declared for MPEG-2, not MPEG-1</p>

<pre><code>{ AV_CODEC_ID_MPEG2VIDEO, MKTAG('m', 'p', 'g', 'v') }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>All the tag variants exist because each vendor or program decides to mark their streams a certain way and there's no single body policing their use. Stick with <code>mp2v</code> since that works for you.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I just realized that any stream can be tagged with any tag if <code>-strict -1</code> or <code>-2</code> is applied. I was able to tag an AVC stream in a MOV with <code>mpgv</code> :) </p>

"why is a video file with .mts extension so huge?","700","","<p>I just recorded a 2 minute long video clip with my Sony camera. The output is an .MTS file, which is ~450 MB. What is the reason for that? Could you please recommend a (preferably free) app that I could use to convert it to another file format resulting a much more reasonable file size?</p>
","<p>HD video is very, very large at high quality.  450MB for two minutes isn't actually that bad.  To put it in perspective, assuming you were shooting 1080P and 24fps, if there was no compression applied, that same 2 minutes of video would be 6 gigabytes of information.</p>

<p>The reason that videos you download or watch on bluray disks are so much smaller is that they are not source video, but rather highly compressed final output video.  When you compress video, a lot of quality is lost.  It isn't quality that the human eye can easily distinguish, but it is quality that impacts the quality of future encodings and the quality of edited results.</p>

<p>For best quality, you want to take those high quality, large files you captured, edit them to whatever the final output should be and then do a one time compression down to a final output format.  That final output won't be suitable for editing, but it will be perfectly suitable for viewing at a much smaller size.</p>

<p>If you have no desire to edit it and simply want the basic video to be smaller, using a free tool like Handbrake or FFMPEG will easily allow you to transcode to h.264 and a much, much smaller file size.  I recommend using two-pass VBR to maximize the quality you get for the size.</p>

<p>Do I have to be concerned with heat/steam interfering?  Any tips on thwarting such problems?</p>

<p>Lastly, lighting.  I have no clue, I guess I'm looking for affordable and not too bulky.</p>
","<p>I will answer this in a few parts</p>

<p>Cameras:
I assume you are looking for some kind of a web release for what ever media you are recording and I assume you want to go high def. For this most if not all of the current DSLR's from the big makers (cannon, nikon, etc) will shoot in both 720 and 1080 (i and p depend on the camera but for what you are looking to do I would say either will suffice). When it comes to video my only requirement is that the camera has an external mic input (I know the Nikon D series has them). The on board mics on DSLR's are not that great and an external one is a must. This would be your main camera.</p>

<p>Go Pros are GREAT and come with a wide variety of mounting options. They are also in waterproof cases (I have used mine in the pool a few times with good success) so I would think they could stand up to some puffs of steam although continuous steam will be an issue for any camera.</p>

<p>You can also troll ebay or tag sales etc. for used DSLR's for your overhead shots. You can usually find them cheap and be less worried about them breaking form steam/heat</p>

<p>Mounting:
Good tripods area easy to find. In this case I would look for something hefty but on the smaller side. I have a small Slik 504 that is small but really steady and has a smooth head. I also have a MeFoto for when Im on the road. These are much smaller than the Slik's but REALLY well made (all aluminum) and will not have a problem holding your DSLR.</p>

<p>Lights:
Theater/Video lights can be pricy as can their mounting hardware. For this I will offer a simple home brew hack. Go to home depot and pick up the double halogen with stand work light. They are constantly on sale and fit the bill really well. they are bright, cheap, and come mounted to a stand. They usually are capable of pivoting in all directions as well.</p>

<p>Steam solution:
I dont know much about this issue but one possibility is to mount a mirror over the stove and shoot the mirror. This puts the camera out of the line of steam and out of harms way. You can also get one of those shower mirrors that does not fog up in high steam environments.</p>

<p>Hope This Helps...</p>

"Video metadata: What is ""Video delay"" used for?","694","","<p>Recently, I'm forced to fiddle with a nasty little problem with videos that have some special metadata attributes, namely ""delay"" or ""delay_relative_to_video"".</p>

<p>There's a software videoconferencing solution wich produces these special files, and when our videoprocessing software examines these files, it gets longer duration values than the actual length of the content, thus storing wrong data into the database which causes more trouble in the postprocessing phase.</p>

<p>For example, we recorded a 46 second long video, which was detected as 104.7 seconds long.</p>

<p>After inspecting the file with FFmpeg and Mediainfo, it turned out that the original file had a so called ""delay"" value which can be seen as <code>start</code> time in FFmpeg's output:</p>

<p>""Surprisingly"", substracting the length and the delay gives me the correct duration...</p>

<p>Also, it is really embarrassing that some encoder libraries count these delays towards the total length, but some of them doesn't! Seemingly there's no way to distinguish which length values are correct and which were incremented accordingly!</p>

What's the reason of their existence and why does some encoders/video editing software injecting these metadata into the file?</p>

","<p>Microphone outputs are typically very low level and have only enough output to drive a sensitive preamp, not headphones.  To drive headphones you need an amplified output.  According to a variety of sources, the D3300 does not have a headphone jack, which means you have to provide a separate amplifier, which means you have to provide one, and the power to drive it, and the cable to connect to it.  I suspect the best solution would be a battery-powered preamp that receives your mic output and then delivers two amplified outputs: line level for your D3300 input jack and phones-level for your headphones.</p>

"Blackmagic setup: How do I record all cameras in a multicam broadcast?","690","","<p>I've been tasked with acquiring equipment to broadcast a festival through online stream, and have decided that blackmagic may be a good direction to go, so I'm going to strictly reference their products.</p>

<p>Currently I'm planning on purchasing:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 x Blackmagic ATEM Production Studio 4K</li>
<li>4 x Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera 4K</li>
<li>1 x Blackmagic UltraStudio Mini Recorder (thunderbolt)</li>
<li>Some very long SDI cable runs</li>
</ul>

<p><br><strong>Problem:</strong>
<br>The cameras do not have internal storage, which means I can only record what's going to the stream through the UltraStudio mini recorder. Is there some kind of device I can set up between the cameras and the ATEM production studio to record my video feeds?</p>

<p>I don't think the ATEM has enough video outs to send to each feed to a capture card like the DeckLink SDI 4K. If I went this route, would I need something like the Smart Videohub?</p>

<p>Lastly, the cameras claim to have built in talkback and tally. Can I use this feature with my current equipment list? Or do I need the ATEM Talkback Converter?</p>

<p><br><strong>Update:</strong>
<br>I've decided that 3 blackmagic pocket cinema cameras (BPCCs) and a GoPro may actually be a better option for this. The BPCCs have a built in display (useful for my camera operators) and have internal storage via SD card. They also seem to perform well in low lighting. The downside is the cameras only have HDMI out, so I would require HDMI to SDI converters to run long lengths of cable (probably around 150-200ft per cable).</p>

<p>Am I going to have issues trying to use BPCCs with converters for live streaming? Are there other solutions for long cable runs that I may have missed?</p>
","<p>You can use an SDI Distribution Amplifier (""DA"") (one SDI input, and two or more SDI outputs) for each camera so you can ""duplicate"" the camera video to send to both the production switcher and to your camera iso recorders. I use DAs I buy on Ebay.  My current favorite is ""AVUE 3G-SDI/HD-SDI/SDI 1 to 2 Repeater &amp; distribution extender with re-clocking"" at around $100</p>

<p>Or you could use something like the Blackmagic Smart VideoHub 12x12 if you have the budget for it.  Of course, you will need a separate recorder for each video stream. It seems unlikely that you can successfully use more than one UltraStudio Mini Recorder per computer.</p>

<p>The camera has a built-in tally light and the switcher sends the tally signals back to the cameras (assuming you use TWO SDI cables per camera!)  The tally light appears to be quite small and hidden just above the lens mount, so it seems of limited visibility unless you have a very small lens and are very close to the camera. There does not appear to be any kind of output for an external tally that can be seen at a distance one would expect in the Real World, or any tally provision for a camera operator. Are you planning on using these as human-operated cameras?  Or remote-controlled?  Or fixed POV cameras?</p>

<p>The Micro Studio Camera 4K has intercom built-in, with a 3.5mm TRRS socket for a headset as one would use with an iPhone, etc.  However you will need an ATEM Talkback Converter to access the intercom/talkback back at the switcher end.</p>

<p>Remember also that those cameras do not come with lenses, and they use a rather premium lens mount, so you may end up spending 2x or 3x for each camera by the time you hang some glass on the front of them.  The Blackmagic stuff seems like great performance for the money, but not necessarily when you add up all the required ""accessories"".  Especially if you want to equip the camera(s) with operator-controlled lenses. You could end up with 4x-5x the base price for each camera.</p>

<p>Remember also that SDI is quite high frequency and doesn't tolerate ""very long SDI cable runs"".  My working rule is that even with large RG-6 cable, 300ft/100m is the practical length limit. If you want to go longer than that, those fiber optic boxes from Blackmagic are one solution if you have the budget for that.</p>

"Deinterlace by dropping even lines from command line","690","","<p>I want to make an interlaced video with 50fps into a 25fps progressive, in the process i'm also reducing the size of the frame.

So what i am afraid of is that they will actually start bleeding information i am trying to drop into the frames that i am trying to keep.</p>

When i attempt to dump into Huff codec (to not introduce quality loss due to reencoding) it demands that i split files at 4 GiB. So i can only use it for small videos.</p>

","<p><code>ffmpeg -i input -vf field,scale=123:456 output</code> will do the trick, where 123:456 is your x:y frame dimensions for the output.

Note that you'll need extra stuff in the command to get good results - e.g. you'll probably want to specify codec details and so on.</p>

","<p>Are you using the inbuilt After Effects render queue? It's a bit easier to use custom settings when you use the Adobe Media Encoder instead. AME comes with After Effects and is installed automatically when you install AE. Simply open the composition you want to export in After Effects and select <em>Composition</em> → <em>Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue</em>. This will open AME and add the current state of your composition to the render queue (this might take some time). Once you see the item in the render queue, press the highlighted format designation to open the Export Settings dialogue. </p>

<p>In the Export Settings, you can change the format (codec/container) as well as the other export parameters. Make sure to set the dimensions (Width/Height) to whatever you need them to be.

"How is possible for YouTube and Vimeo transcode so fast?","687","","<p>For the bit I read YouTube and Vimeo rely on servers powered by some modified libs i guess like libavcodec and tools like ffmpeg in a serious custom build.</p>

<p>Let's assume a transcode to h264 but the same could be applied to other codecs, I think VP8 and VP9 works in the same way.</p>

<p>If I upload 1h video file on their servers, right after the upload i have all the versions ready... pratically like 1 seconds after.</p>

<p>But, if codecs doesn't scale horizontally in a good way unless you want to trade time vs compression (see h264) and I'm pretty sure this websites care about the size of the videos..</p>

<p>Given also that single threads speed are capped by CPU frequency and actual frequency isn't up to 3.5 ghz generally unless they use overclocked servers under liquid nitrogen :D</p>

<p>How the transcode is done so fast?</p>

<p>They use still multithread with a mix of settings, trading on initial file size, custom builds and everything else to have just the files insta-ready to the user and then continue a second transcode with a slow preset that will be swapped as soon this file will be ready? They start to transcode as soon they receive the file stream (aka: during the upload ?)</p>
","<p>A common method is split-and-stitch where the file is cut into pieces and sent to multiple servers for transcode. That way you can transcode a file of any length in a fixed amount of time.</p>

<p>Telestreams Episode Engine can do this, but I'm sure Google uses something custom coded. </p>

"Will Canon 600D be able to do these?","683","","<p>A few days ago I watched Chris Nolan's Following and thought to myself ""I can do something like this"".</p>

<p>I have found out that Nolan used Bolex for the film. He still uses film cameras and is against digital cameras.</p>

<p>I would like to create shots that are reminiscent of La Haine , Following and the older films like Death on the Nile etc.</p>

<p>I found Canon 600D for about 550-600 dollars ( and various versions with different lenses) .</p>

<p>Is it good for a filmmaking beginner? I want to create old-film style setups. Maybe some car interior shots. Timelapses. 4:3 videos.</p>

<p>Which lens should I use for old film looks? Do you recommend cheap tripod and external mics? I'm open to any help.</p>

<p>Also: Whats the difference between IS and DC lens. DS is much cheaper.</p>
","<p>Yes, DSLRs are a good starting point for doing movie type projects.  The use of interchangeable lenses and the shallower depth of field offered by larger sensors than found in most consumer video cameras allows for far more artistic options.  This is why DSLRs are very popular with the amateur film making community.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that they are not without their drawbacks.  All but the most recent DSLRs (including the 600d) lack auto-focus while shooting video, so you will have to either focus before shots or manually adjust your focus during the shot.  (If you move up to the 650d instead and use STM lenses, it IS able to auto focus when shooting video.)  Focus peaking can help with this by providing highlighting of the most in-focus points in the image, but it requires the use of custom firmware software like Magic Lantern.  (I've personally used ML, but it isn't without some small degree of risk to your camera.)</p>

<p>Additionally, DSLRs suffer from something known as a rolling shutter.  On a high end video camera, the entire image for each frame is captured at the same time, thus quick pans look crisp.  On a DSLR however, the sensor is scanned line by line when shooting video, so fast pans result in a ""jello"" effect (which is well documented with numerous videos demonstrating the problem on Youtube).</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that you do still get what you pay for in quality.  A near bottom of the line consumer DSLR, particularly with a dirt cheap kit lens that comes with it is going to have much more marginal quality than anything professional.  Even a higher end entry level model like a t4i (650d) or better yet, a mid-range model like a 70d will have far superior quality.  Similarly, replacing the kit lens with something like a 50mm f/1.8 prime or other better quality lens will result in a substantial improvement in video quality.</p>

<p>It still won't be anything near Hollywood level though.  About the closest you can get to Hollywood quality for under $7,000 is a 5D Mark iii running ML and shooting RAW footage on high end L optics, but even at $3,500 for the camera body and $1,500 to $2,500 for the lens, the quality still ends up being noticeably lower (to the professional eye) than a professional video camera like an ARRI Alexa (which costs $50,000+), but it is close enough to raise eyebrows in the professional community.</p>

<p>That all said though, DSLRs (even the basic models) still offer more bang for the buck in terms of artistic control than almost any consumer level camera, just so long as you also realize they are harder to use for video than a consumer camera, which can handle more for you, but gives you less options.</p>

"Ronin M vs. Helix Jr","682","","<p>Has anybody used the new DJI Ronin-M and compared it to the Letus Helix Jr.?
I'm considering a gimbal purchase for my DSLR videography and haven't seen anything that tells me why the Helix is twice the price of the Ronin-M.</p>
","<p>For half the price and DSLRs only, the Ronin M probably makes more sense. The Helix Jr. makes sense for more. It can hold up to 12 lb of stuff vs the M's 8 lb (which is kind of crazy, considering that it's even lighter), and the fact that it's naturally at heart-ish level as opposed to belt level means a lot for good framing and the ability to hold it at a good frame for an extended period of time. You can get it to eye level for more easily than the Ronin, even in Upright mode (or whatever it's called), because it flips the camera upside down. (They both have briefcase mode for very low shots.)</p>

<p>If you want a second person with total control, the Ronin is absolutely the way to go. But if you're a one-man band and can afford the premium, the Helix is probably the better option.</p>

"Console Audio and Commentary Capture - Is it possible to capture both?","681","","<p>I've been scouring google to see if it's possible to record gameplay audio for consoles as well as live commentary from a microphone or headset. Most of what I come across, from either forums or product FAQs say that it's possible to do one but not both. On PCs, it's easy, but on consoles you can only do one. Or so I'm told.</p>

<p>However, I see quite a few videos on Youtube from consoles with both game audio and live commentary. So it must be possible.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me how how it's possible to do both on a console? I know nothing about video editing and production so I'm curious what devices and programs are needed to accomplish this. Also, is it possible to record the console audio and live commentary as two separate tracks?</p>

<p>Thank you for your time! I appreciate any help.</p>
","<p>As I understand it you want to record and not stream your gameplay live via twitch or other live streaming services?</p>

<p>In that case you just record your game video and audio with your desired method (f.e. a PC capture card) and then you just record you voice at the same time with your PC/Laptop/Smartphones microphone input. When you are done recording you just sync your commentary audio file with your game footage later on using a video editor.</p>

<p>Something that could help to sync game footage and commentary would be to record a small bit of the game audio with your microphone over your speakers before starting your commentary, then you can easily sync your commentary by alligning it with the game audio manually. Thats how you usually sync multiple audio sources the cheap way when filming, another method would be to use a mixer like AJ Henderson suggested which will keep everything in sync for you but also costs money.</p>

<p>Popular video editors are Adobe Premiere and Apple Final Cut. A good free editor would be Lightworks.</p>

","<p>Unfortunately, there aren't really cheap options to do this.  You can approximate it using a crane or a stabilization rig (like a SteadiCam Jr), but both of those is still going to cost you hundreds of dollars.  </p>

<p>For horizontal movement, the cheapest option is probably to use a more basic track and roll it by hand.  You can use a motion control unit to get smoother motion, but a motion control unit itself is going to be over a grand normally.  </p>

<p>For pure vertical, you need something called a camera pedestal.  Unfortunately, this is probably the most complex movement to perform in a controlled manner, so there simply are no cheap options.  There are some DIY approaches out there, but you're looking at expensive hardware if you want to do a pure vertical movement with good control.  (The cheapest commercial pedestal I know of is over a grand.)</p>

<p>That is just the way the market is for being able to do advanced moves.  They are all specialized, limited use devices and the cost rapidly multiplies with the weight of the camera.  That's why rigging costs so much, because the market is so limited and specialized.  It requires careful design, tight tolerances and a very limited market, that all adds up to big costs to the consumer.</p>

"Are ""mp2v"" and ""mpgv"" valid MPEG-2 codec tags in an MOV?","674","","<p>This question is related to <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/17526/what-is-the-correct-mpeg-2-fourcc"">What is the correct MPEG-2 FourCC?</a> and to an open discussion <a href=""http://ffmpeg-users.933282.n4.nabble.com/MPEG-2-video-m2v1-vs-mp2v-tp4674329p4674338.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">currently on the ffmpeg-user mailing list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am wondering if I should file a bug report about the MOV output. Open 
  questions in that vein, though, are: </p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Is it a bug that mpg2 and mpgv cause MOV output to fail or is that 
  correct behavior? </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There seem to be numerous possible tags in use for MPEG-2 video, in particular <code>m2v1</code>, <code>mp2v</code>, <code>mpg2</code>, and <code>mpgv</code>.</p>

<p>Now, ffmpeg fails with e.g. ""Tag mpgv/0x7667706d incompatible with 
output codec id '2' (m2v1)"" when the output is MOV and either <code>mpg2</code> or <code>mpgv</code> is specified:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg ... -vcodec mpeg2video -f mov ...             # succeeds (m1v1)
ffmpeg ... -vcodec mpeg2video -vtag mp2v -f mov ...  # succeeds
ffmpeg ... -vcodec mpeg2video -vtag mpg2 -f mov ...  # fails
ffmpeg ... -vcodec mpeg2video -vtag mpgv -f mov ...  # fails
</code></pre>

<p>All of those succeed for AVI. Ffmpeg's default tag for MPEG-2 in AVIs is <code>mpg2</code>.</p>

<p>Part of a bug report that I am writing for ffmpeg's MOV output handling may include the <code>mpg2</code> and <code>mpgv</code> failure behavior (with the desired behavior being success), but before I do that I need to be certain that this behavior is a bug rather than appropriate behavior.</p>

<p>So my question boils down to this: Are <code>mpg2</code> and <code>mpgv</code> valid, allowable alternative tags for MPEG-2 video <strong>in an MOV file</strong>, and are there others? I am looking for official Apple sources and MOV specifications rather than anecdotal evidence or lists of generally observed FourCC's / codec IDs.</p>

<p>I know that, at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_container_formats"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Wikipedia</a>, MPEG-2 video in an MOV is an acceptable combination, I'm just not sure what the acceptable set of codec tags are in MOVs. This question is not about the ""correct"" MPEG-2 ID in general cases, it is about the allowable variants specifically in MOVs.</p>
","<p>MPEG-2 doesn't seem to be an officially sanctioned codec for the Quicktime container. The official specification has a section related to <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFChap3/qtff3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000939-CH205-BBCGIJJI"">MPEG-1</a> in MOV but not MPEG-2. The US Library of Congress also does not have an entry for the <a href=""http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000052.shtml"">subtype</a> MPEG-2 in MOV, like it does for MPEG-1 (just called QTV_MPEG).</p>

<p>So, there's no official word on ""allowable alternative tags"". One can only examine MPEG-2 MOVs and see whether apps, specifically, Apple apps, play them or not and prepare a survey report. Since each app has its own fiat on whether it plays a file with a certain codec ID or not, that report whould be categorized by app i.e. VLC, Quicktime player. FCP..etc.</p>

<p>As an example, VLC recognizes the <a href=""https://github.com/videolan/vlc/blob/9053b0919f00d88f16e1ef3e3f79b1cced74f742/src/misc/fourcc_list.h"">following tags</a> for generic MPEG-2 i.e. not IMX or XDCAM:</p>

"Common newbie mistakes for cinematography?","667","","<p>I'm going to make a serious movie, what are the BIG mistakes newbies often do, both in the clipping and the shooting stage?</p>
","<p>Common oversights of beginners in pre-production:</p>

<p>1) No script or plan of action. Even if you are doing something very abstract or experimental, have a plan of how things begin, develop and end. You can always change this as you proceed, but it's most important to have a baseline. This should include your budget of money and time for all concerned.</p>

<p>2) No research. If you are shooting a documentary or a narrative be sure to do all the fact checking or if this is fiction, make it plausible or not if you desire the comical.</p>

<p>3) No storyboard. The storyboard is a series of panels like a comic book that describes each scene and the action contained within. This is how the camera will set up for each shot. From the storyboard you can derive a shot list.</p>

<p>4) No idea of screen direction. Right from the storyboard you should have a good handle on the direction the action moves within the frame as well as taking into account how the camera may move to cover such action whether that is a pan, tilt, crane, handheld, etc. shot. The key here is continuity of movement from shot to shot. Learn about screen direction and cover the 180 degree rule as this also falls under continuity.</p>

<p>5) No production schedule. Most movies do no shoot each scene in the scripted sequence because you can save a lot of time and money by shooting by location, time of day, or other logistical considerations. I once worked as an Hollywood extra in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". The last shoot or wrap night as they called it was actually a sequence near the beginning of the film. Plan your shooting schedule to optimize each location as appropriate.</p>

<p>Common oversights of beginners in production:</p>

<p>1) Not locking down exposure, focus, and white balance.</p>

<p>2) Terrible lighting. Learn about shooting with existing light, and how to make it work with reflectors if need be. If you are shooting indoors, learn about basic 3 point lighting to start. The most important thing is to make sure your subject is lit well and defined.</p>

<p>3) Terrible sound recording. Learn the basics of sound recording, like setting the level so it does not exceed peak load and not changing the recording level while recording. Also, get creative with sound too, learn about Foley and explore ways to create your own effects.</p>

<p>4) Camera shake: it's one thing to shoot hand held but if you are trying for a steady tripod shot, make sure you don't touch the camera when its recording. For instance one of my cameras has a remote so I can start and stop it with out even getting near the camera. Also, if you are using a tripod be sure that it has enough weight to handle the wind. For hand held shots shoot wide angle as vibration is proportionately magnified by increasing focal length (zooming in).</p>

<p>5) Over zealous use of zooming. Learn to use the zoom feature when it is transparent and does not call attention to itself. For instance a more effective use of zooming in or out is done simultaneously with a pan or tilt (assuming you have a tripod with a fluid head) while following an action. A good example of this is how a sports cameramen will follow a play such as someone trying to steal 2nd base.</p>

<p>6) Learn to compose a shot. Use the law of thirds in framing a subject, and when to make exceptions. I highly recommend art history 101 for beginners to learn about composition. Study the greats from Leonardo da Vinci to Pablo Picasso to understand how to frame your subject and study film history 101 to learn how great directors worked with framing in motion, e.g., Orson Welles' work in ""Citizen Kane"". Others: Billy Wilder, Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa to name a few.</p>

<p>7) Didn't get enough takes to cover the action. Make sure that you have enough good takes of each shot on the shot list. Be sure to allow some flexibility with adding long shots, medium shots, and close ups all with different angles to optimize the light and action. Shooting more is better than less from an editing point of view. Editors love to have tons of stuff to choose from as long as these extra shots highlight the intent and the director is behind it.</p>

<p>Common oversights of beginners in post-production:</p>

<p>1) Wrong format. Be sure that your camera files are compatible with your video and music/sound editing suite.</p>

<p>2) Too much time on one clip. Unless you are using a steady moving crane shot don't expect to keep anyone's attention if your shots are too long, and don't have any sense of movement or action. Having a wide variety of long, medium, and close up shots with varying angles to choose from that cut swiftly on action and appear transparent will be more engaging to your audience.</p>

<p>3) Jump cuts: this is all about continuity, learn when and when not to use a jump cut.
One acceptable form of the jump cut is the 'magic cut' such as some one suddenly appears in the frame like in Star Trek when they beam up. A bad jump cut is when something that may have been in the previous scene is misplaced in the following shot or the reverse is true too. There are a zillion examples of jump cuts. One famous one is Dustin Hoffman driving the wrong way on the SF Bay Bridge in ""The Graduate"".</p>

<p>4) Over use of effects. There is a huge temptation to over use an effect you may find interesting, even experienced cinematographers can easily over use something new to them and unfortunately your audience finds this boring and distracting. The golden rule is to use effects sparingly but appropriately when used. The best way to learn this is to see how this effect has been successfully used before by professionals in great movies.</p>

<p>5) Non-original music. Too many beginners use popular music for their productions. Even if it appears to fit, we've heard it already. Does ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" have to always play for a sun rise or moon rise? The question you should ask yourself is, how many buddies of mine play music, how many are good and want to work on it with me? Got a friend that can compose? Original music makes any production refreshing and takes your film from the ordinary to the unique as long as you make the music interesting and supports the film action.</p>

<p>6) Pay attention to the basic rules but don't be afraid to take some risks. My number one rule is that if I break one I better have a darn good reason and it really has to work within the context of the film I am working on.</p>

","<p>In After Effects, make sure your Cineware effect on the Cinema4D track has the Project Settings --> Camera set to Comp Camera, as shown below:</p>

<p>This setting means that the camera in your After Effects comp will control the viewpoint of the object, instead of any camera in your Cinema 4D project (I think C4D creates a camera by default, even though you can't see it in the Objects panel, otherwise nothing would render).</p>

<p>That said, the bug seems to manifest only in this idealized environment of two spheres. The first sphere (radius 1) emits the particles, and the second sphere (radius 3) kills them. It is likely because of the exact alignment between vertices that causes it to penetrate.</p>

"What are the audio production capabilities in Sony Vegas Pro because I see mostly plug-ins only?","656","","<p>I have read that from the NLE video editors Sony Vegas Pro is better than the competitors in terms of the audio editing capabilities. But using it there still seem to be a limited set. Mostly the editing is the addition of plugin effects or to open the audio in another editor. Am I missing something which the program allows?</p>
","<p>If you are judging Vegas Pro audio editing on native effects than I don't think it has any edge over others.</p>

<p>I have been using the Pro version for about 18 months now and I find it pretty darn good overall. I am also learning Adobe Premiere and After Effects CS5.5, so far I think Vegas has the edge on the audio for sure.</p>

<p>However, are you aware that Vegas Pro audio editing has the ability to add as many audio tracks as your system can handle (stereo or mono), treat each track with a pan position feature, set individual volume (amplitude) envelopes for each clip, boost or buck the audio overall output of each track, name each track, size the vertical and horizontal view of the audio track as you see fit, record directly to any track, cut any audio clip any way you want, reverse an audio clip with two mouse clicks, and edit Dolby 5.1? And this is only a partial list of some of the built in controls available.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I omitted one feature that I really love, both audio and video tracks can have their order rearranged very easily. With a simple mouse click and drag, you can put that bass line near the drum track or move the voice-over above the music track. I like to move audio tracks as I am building them to keep it tiddy.
:></p>

<p>This list is not complete and does not include the native sound effects which as mentioned earlier are rather standard with any NLE: reverb, EQ, pitch shift, delay, etc. And yes, AFAIK, it can accept plugins but I have never needed any at this point so I am not aware what plugins are compatible.</p>

<p>I have both Vegas Pro 10 and the home version of Sony Sound Forge. I can export an audio clip to Sound Forge for further effects, it's sort of like Audacity on steroids. As far as I know you can render your audio portion to several formats and export to anything that has the same format. I haven't tried this, but I would think you could easily export your audio as a .wav to Audacity but I have never needed to export the audio for further processing except to test it with Sound Forge, and in that exercise, I just had to copy paste the clip--easy.</p>

<p>I have made video content with Vegas Pro that has had as many as 18 stereo tracks with no issues.</p>

<p>Remember Vegas was originally a multi track audio editor.</p>

<p>I think the best answer is for you to try the trail version of Vegas Pro 11 for free for 30 days and kick the tires and then take a spin:</p>

<p>Disclaimer:
I should mention that I sort of have one hand tied behind my back on this answer as it would be so much more useful to launch Vegas when answering this to review the features. My version of Vegas lives on a machine that is not accessible from the network for security reasons and that location is about 8 miles from where I am typing this.</p>

"How can I rename a footage .ai file for AE without breaking the references?","655","","<p>I've got a composition in After Effects CS 6 on Windows that contains several .ai files. One of them has over 30 layers, which I imported and animated in AE. Unfortunately, I gave the .ai file the not so clever name <code>foo.ai</code> because it started out as a test but worked, and I'd like to go ahead with it. When I rename the file to something more sensible, like <code>Scene 1 - Spaceship.ai</code>, AE complains about a missing footage file. Now it wants me to give it the new path, which I do. I have to select the layer from the .ai as well. And it looks like it wants me to do it for every layer from the same file.</p>

<p>I've already tried making a copy of the AE project file, opening it with a text editor and replacing all occurrences of <code>foo.ai</code> with <code>Scene 1 - Spaceship.ai</code>. After that, AE told me it <em>tried to read after the end of file</em>. Looks like there's a file length in there. Damn.</p>

<p>So how can I do this without having to change the source file and resellecting the layer for each individual layer in AE?</p>
","<p>Save the project in XML file format, do as you already did, open it in a text editor, find-replace the name. Open the modified file in AE and re-save it in its normal binary format (aep).</p>

"Optimizing MPEG2 Encoder in Adobe Media Encoder","643","","<p>We're looking at using MPEG2 as an alternative to ProRes 422 for delivery &amp; archiving.</p>

<p>There are many options in there which are beyond my knowledge; I would like to understand them and maybe get even better results. Is there a guide to these terms?</p>

<ul>
<li>Macroblock quantization</li>
<li>VBV buffer size</li>
<li>Noise Control (Sensitivity/Reduction)</li>
<li>Write SDE</li>
<li>Intra DC Precision (8/9/10 bits) </li>
<li>Ignore Frame Interval</li>
</ul>
","<p>MPEG-2 works by compressing in two different ways.  Within a frame, it looks at groups of pixels (blocks) and compresses them based on patterns it finds within them.  This is kind of similar to how JPEG compression work.  the Macroblock quantization level describes how loosely the encoded block can represent the original block.  The lower the number, the higher the quality but the more data required to represent the block since less error is accepted when trying to compress.</p>

<p>VBV Buffer Size is the size of the buffer required in order to maintain a constant frame rate.  Each frame of video in MPEG-2 requires different amounts of data from other frames.  Assuming the stream arrives at a constant data rate, a certain amount of buffer is needed to ensure that data continues to arrive in time to present a frame since the rate of arrival may sometimes be lower than the rate of data being consumed.  This value allows the player to judge how much data it needs to buffer in order to avoid running out of information to display to the viewer.</p>

<p>Noise Control is a means of trying to avoid encoding inefficiencies from noise present in the video.  MPEG-2 and other predictive encoding schemes rely on the fact that video tends to not change from frame to frame.  Noise, however, is random and not able to be predicted.  This is a significant problem for high efficiency compression since it can't be predicted.  Reducing the noise before encoding results in better compression rates as the video is more predictable, but also results in some loss of detail as it is not possible to distinguish between noise and fine detail in many cases.</p>

<p>Write SDE writes out information about the vertical and horizontal size of the frame.</p>

<p>Intra DC Precision is the number of bits used (thus the accuracy) of the DC coefficients.  It also impacts how accurately blocks are quantized.  Higher values mean more precision is used, but also that higher data rates are required.</p>

<p>Ignore Frame Interval I'm not 100% sure on for that encoder, but generally it allows the encoder to adjust the keyframe interval as it deems necessary.  It may use more or less data as needed, low motion video will likely benefit as the keyframes can be further spread out, however high motion video is more likely to suffer if the interval becomes too long.</p>

"How is each type of video camera stabilizer different?","641","","<p>What are the kinds of video camera stabilizers I could buy in the market? How are they different? What are the pros and cons of each?</p>
","<p>There are a very wide and diverse range of different techniques for stabilization.</p>

<p>At the most basic, you have pure software stabilization.  This uses no specialized hardware, but rather tracks objects within a scene and then clips the video such that it maintains a frame which it can keep more stable.  This has an apparent impact of subjects moving less, but often produces an awkward feeling wavy effect as motion blur is still present in the source footage and occurs while the subject doesn't visibly appear to be moving.  It can also be used in support of other physical techniques.  It can handle minor corrections, but isn't advisable for large scale correction if it can be avoided.  This can be applied either in post or directly during capture on the camera (electronic image stabilization.)</p>

<p>At the next level, we move up to optical image stabilization systems.  There are two main techniques here.  The first utilizes a motion correction element in the lens along with small gyroscopes in the lens to keep the orientation of the corrective element relatively static.  This results in a correction for shake in the lens' orientation, but doesn't correct for lateral movement.  A similar system can be accomplished in camera by moving the sensor itself to correct for movement of the camera.  Gyroscopes feed the data on how to move the sensor.</p>

<p>Moving past that, the next big step up is a hand held gimbal stabilizer.  Gimbal stablizers work using inertia to offset movement rather than gyroscopic forces.  A typical handheld gimbal stabilizer consists of a rod with a free floating gimbal about 1/3 of the way along the length.  The camera is mounted on the top and a series of balancing weights are added to the bottom.  The inertia of the combined and properly balanced system results in orientation changes being absorbed at the gimbal as the inertia keeps the camera rig pointed in the same direction.  These provide far better stabilization for orientation and also provide a fair bit of stabilization for lateral movements, however they are considerably more expensive and more difficult to use well than an optical image stabilization system is.  It can also still be used with the previous mechanisms.</p>

<p>The next step up from this is a steadicam like rig.  Steadicam utilizes a gimbal stabilizer, however, rather than hand hold the gimbal, it is mounted on a spring arm attached to the operator's chest.  The spring arm allows for much better weight support as well as better absorption of lateral movement, thus it is able to deal with situations such as an operator running while operating the camera.</p>

<p>The final upgrade is to move back in to active systems again.  The inertial systems are all passive and thus don't require independent power (the OIS systems are active, but the inertial ones are passive.)  By adding high powered gyroscopes to an inertial system, additional stabilization can be achieved by providing active counter-action to changes in orientation.  The upside is that these hybrids provide the absolute best possible stabilization, but the downside is they are generally heavy, expensive (thousands to tens of thousands of dollars), power hungry and complex.</p>

<p>So at each time position a clip is generated with 10 seconds either side of the time resulting in a 20 second clip.</p>

","<p>You can use an EDL (Edit Decision List) in the CMX3600 format. An EDL is a very simple import/export format from the 1970s, when data was exchanged using floppy disks and videos were stored on tape. It's just a text file and most modern NLEs (including Premiere Pro) can import/export it. (Today there are some variations between NLEs, but that doesn't have to bother you.)</p>

<p>To understand EDLs, it's probably best that you create a new timeline and put your MPG video in it. Then export the timeline into an EDL (File > Export > EDL) and open the exported file with a simple text editor. Analyse the content. Then do some cut in your timeline and export it again.</p>

<p>Basically, an EDL consists of several text lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>VJ0K006W V    C         00:00:00:00 00:00:18:19 00:00:22:02 00:00:40:21
</code></pre>

<p>The first column is an ID of your video clip, followed by V for a video track and C for a cut. An A instead of V indicates an audio track. The last 4 columns are timecodes which define the in and out point of the source and the in and out point in the timeline. You see that this clip is the first 18 seconds and 19 frames of the input video starting in the timeline at 22 seconds and 2 frames. It's only logical that the clip must end 18 seconds and 19 frames later, at the timeline position 40 seconds and 21 frames.</p>

<p>Now, to answer your question: You have to write a small program (or ask a friend to write) which takes your CSV file as input, extracts the time position, calculates the +/- 10 seconds, and writes an EDL file in the way that Premiere Pro exported. Premiere Pro should import it without problems and assemble the timeline.</p>

<p>Here are some footnotes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_timecode"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> explains how timecodes are constructed. If you have simple frame rates like 24, 25, or 30 fps, calculating your +/- 10 seconds is not so difficult. But if your clip has 29.97 fps, then you have to consider drop frames. (You know that leap years have an additional day - February 29, but only occur in distinct years. Clips with 29.97 fps have normally 30 frames per second, but at distinct times have 2 frames less.)</p></li>
<li><p>I didn't cover the problem of media file names here. When the EDL/CMX3600 format was defined, media only had tape numbers, which were written in the first column of the EDL. When file-based media came into existence, NLEs had to add the file names somehow to the EDL. They did it, but not in a consistent way. But since you only work with Premiere Pro, just see how your video file name appears in the EDL file and mimic the same when writing your file. </p></li>

"QoS for video streaming","636","","<p>What are the most used metrics to evaluate the QoS of a video streaming session? I am looking for tutorials, papers, lecture notes, ppt, anything of that kind, or your own answer.</p>
","<p><strong>From the perceptual front (in the user point of view):</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Quality:</strong> 
Here we are evaluating quality of video and audio being streamed. Usually, higher the bit rate better the quality - but it also means more <em>cost</em>. The basic quality measure for Video is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">PSNR</a>. However, more relevant matrices from the perceptual quality is <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.7246&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">blockiness</a> and there are many other approaches like <a href=""http://www.cic.unb.br/~mylene/PI/WinklerMohandas2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.
Usually, choosing the codec and bit rate fixes the quality primarily, so network doesn't effect that much in that case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency (or lack of jerkiness):</strong>
This is a rough measure of times when the continually running stream got interrupted. Usually this is a measure of length and pauses that are caused due to unavailability or reduction of bandwidth during some time and player needs to wait for the data to arrive. 
Usually, buffering is done to the optimal level in the receiver to minimize the effect on this. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Errors in pictures:</strong> 
This is the indication of errors occurred during the transmission due to which patchy or blank screens. There are cases, where transmission could be error free, in which case, this won't be a problem. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Latency:</strong> 
This refer to amount of time the service needs to begin the deliver and time the system gets reflected to screen. There are various elements of the system that contributes to this. Usually, for VoD type systems, some reasonable but it is a reasonable concern for the two systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>End-to-end delay or so called guarantee:</strong>
The end-to-end delay is essentially same as round trip delay between two systems. For two way communications like telephony, end-to-end delay is of great importance. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service guarantee:</strong> 
Usually, this refers to probability with which the given service will be surely available to the end users. This is equivalent to probability of call drops or network blocking of calls. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Intrinsic parameters:</strong><br>
Here we can think of QoS metrics from the point of view of basic measures of the network which is reflects the QoS as perceived by user. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Bit rate guarantees:</strong> 
This includes the maximum and minimum of available bandwidth during the entire session. Guarantees available for the network bandwidth is usually the single most </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error rate or Loss runs:</strong> 
Usually, unlike satellite paths, in the internet there are no bit errors (above transport layer) - the errors get reflected in the form of packet losses. Basic metrics is hence packet error rate on the networks. More research has concluded that these can be modeled as loss lengths where typically, errors occur in some bursts. The packet loss and the length of the losses has a significant effect in terms of perceptions. <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.21.7087&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This paper</a> describes this metric in depth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Latencies or Various delays:</strong> 
This involves the delay between the path, setup delay, resource reservation delays and buffer delay that all contributes to initialization of display and latency. Many a times, efficient codecs collects various pictures together before encoding to optimize bit rates this allows more efficient compression (higher quality) but increases the latency. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>System uptime and usage factor:</strong>
If either the systems is dysfunctional (down) or it is fully utilized (blocked) it will have </p></li>

My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can Adobe Premiere CC work equally well with both file types?</li>
<li>Which file type will give better image quality?</li>
<li>Does a single AVCHD clip really comprise multiple files that I'll have to import?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Generally, MP4 is better for compatibility, whereas AVCHD provides the better quality. MP4 (which by the way can mean a million different things, in this case it probably refers to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14"" rel=""nofollow"">MPEG-4 Part 14</a>) files will be compatible with most devices and media players as is, and will be smaller in size compared to AVCHD. This is the option I'd recommend if you wanted to film your vacation and show the recordings as is, without further editing.</p>

<p>If you want the best quality, go with AVCHD. Files will be bigger in size and won't play back on most devices, but you can import them into Premiere Pro and export your edited video to every format you want anyway. Chosing the AVCHD will also open up other recording options on your camera. According to the manual, the highest bitrate avaiable for MP4 is 35Mbps. For AVCHD, the highest possible bitrate should be even higher, though I couldn't find an exact value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can Adobe Premiere CC work equally well with both file types?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. MP4 will record, well <code>.mp4</code> files. AVHCD will probably come as <code>.mts</code> or <code>.m2t</code>/<code>.m2ts</code> files, both of which Premiere Pro can handle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which file type will give better image quality?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AVCHD with the highest recording quality settings. Keep in mind that this will fill up your SD card pretty quickly, according to the manual at about 4 GB per 20 minutes of recording. If this is a problem for you, MP4 might be the better solution, as it offers the better quality/filesize-ratio.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does a single AVCHD clip really comprise multiple files that I'll have to import?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really sure about that. Normally, it should produce one container file every time you press record. Many cameras will split the file at 4 GB or stop the recording when a continuous recording reaches that size. Since you already bought the camera, just try out both options and see what files you get. But Premiere pro should be able to handle whatever you throw at it.</p>

"Is there a standard resolution for Video Presentations?","632","","<p>A friend asked me to put together a video presentation for his companies national sales meeting.  I put it together in Premiere.  All of that went fine, but I'm not sure what resolution to make it.  They're obviously going to be using a projector to present it, but I'm not sure of the specs.  Is there a resolution you recommend using that would probably work best?  Would it probably be a widescreen format?  What questions should I be asking of them about the equipment? </p>
","<p>If it's NTSC/standard def/4x3, 640x480 will be good. If it's HD/widescreen/16x9, 1920x1080 or 1280x720 (1080p and 720p, respectively). Premiere will likely have presets for all of these aspect ratios. </p>

<p>I would ask the projector owner for the pixel dimensions or pixel resolution. Likely, it'll match one of the above pixel dimensions. If the owner's not very projector savvy, ask for the model number and manufacturer, and look up the info you need on their website's support section or downloadable manuals.</p>

<p>The thing to keeop in mind is that the projection hardware is a fixed size...usually one of the pixel dimensions noted above, or something CLOSE to it for computer monitor resolution. Even if you feed a 1280x960 image to an NTSC display, it's going to interpolate it into a 640x480 display. On a projector, what makes it bigger is the lens projecting that tiny 640x480 pixel image to a 10' screen. My point is that if you know the maximum pixel resolution on the projector, you don't need to bother rendering anything MORE than that; it won't affect image quality.</p>

<p>I tried saving a frame to an image file in VLC, but it saved without metadata, so I couldn't figure the shutter speed out.</p>

<p>I know the shutter speed is usually 1/48s (half of 1/frame rate), but this video was shot at night, so I want to check if the camera app used a longer shutter speed.</p>
","<p>If the data was recorded by the camera as EXIF MetaData, Adobe Bridge would reveal the camera settings under the Metadata Panel. You may have to customize within Bridge WHICH metadata you want to look at; because there are literally hundreds, thousands, of types of EXIF data; which could or could not have been embedded; AND at times; you will find what you need hidden in a strange EXIF container. </p>

<p>Simply put; if you don't see a shutter speed setting under MAIN, or CAMERA metadata; the brand camera/type, could have written it elsewhere; so show all; expand all, and scroll down to see if the data is possibly there; hidden in a collapsed field. </p>

<p>If you shot the video at 24fps; you are right in thinking that it likely was recorded at 1/48 / 180 shutter. However; I would think; just based off the engineering / camera / lens type which is built onto the iPhone 7; and how I would engineer the camera to work using, which it does by default-  auto-exposure; that it would rely on aperture priority for exposure; and would thus constantly adjust your shutter speed on the fly based on it's exposure method. So if you did a constant shot from a dark area to bright area; you'd literally see an on the fly adjustment from 1/48 all the way up to 1/4000 or higher. Then aperture might kick in, as the phone as no ND filters to fall back on. </p>

<p>I only add that because usually iPhone footage shot outdoors in bright sunlight looks like it was recorded at HIGH shutter (strobe effect) rather than iris down. The diameter on the lens of an iPhone 7 also would make me think they would use Aperture Priority (constant) <em>as it's practically a pin-hole camera to begin with.</em> </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

"What do you call the video effect where water looks like it's standing still when filmed","629","","<p>I found a few interesting effects, which was labelled under the rolling shutter effect, however I was told that this was NOT an example of rolling shutter effect, what would you call this effect?</p>

<p>The question is 3 fold: I heard they used this effect in movies, which ones, an example clip would be nice, what do they officially call it, and why does this happen? </p>

<p>These are the examples I am referring to:<br>
<strong>REALLY interesting</strong> effects:<br>
For example, the water looks like its static. [PetaPixel][1] explains it; ""by pressing a water tube against a speaker, bibio was able to control the vibration frequency of the water flowing through the tube. He then adjusted the pulses of the water to match up with the frame rate of his Canon 5D Mark II.""<br>

","<p>This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic_effect"">stroboscopic effect</a>.  It refers to when the sample rate is synchronized or very slightly out of sync resulting in a much slower representation of the motion that results from taking a picture that is at the same point or slightly advanced point in a subsequent cycle of a higher frequency cyclic motion.</p>

<p>You can actually do the same exact thing in real life for your own eyes by using a strobe light, which is the more common demonstration, though frame rate can be used too if you can adjust it closely enough.</p>

<li>buy headphones amplifier?</li>
<li>improve the audio source?*</li>
</ol>

<p>*<em>I can/will not use CDs as audio source as this is not compatible with my lifestyle.</em></p>
","<h2>File format</h2>

<p>Bit rate tells surprisingly little about quality in the case of mp3 files. There are old encoders where no matter how low you set the compression, there will always be audible artifacts. But LAME and the like have long gotten over this, and <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/8382/is-there-a-losslessly-compressed-audio-file/8383#8383"">properly done 320 kBit mp3 is for listening purposes lossless</a>, just like <a href=""http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDs are</a>. Note anyway that mp3 is an outdated standard; I'd like to recommend switching to OGG Vorbis but practically this wouldn't gain you anything.</p>

<h2>Network</h2>

<p>What digital connection you use to transfer the file from the source to the DA unit has no influence on the sound whatsoever<sup>1</sup>. WiFi is fine as long as its avarage transmission rate can keep up, which should never be a problem nowadays (apart from complete dropouts if the connection breaks down somehow, of course).</p>

<h2>Sound card</h2>

<p>Laptop on-board sound cards are horrible, so off the top I'd say that's your bottleneck. <em>However</em>, the one thing they usually manage quite well is driving headphones. The main problems that such sound cards have are</p>

<ul>
<li>Awful mic preamps.</li>
<li>Bad AD/DA units.</li>
<li>Insufficient (or no) shielding against interference from power supply bursts etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need the mic inputs. Even low-quality DAs of today can actually reproduce properly bandlimited audio quite faithfully. And the interference issues mostly turn up when you connect to some other audio device (with ground connection), but not so much with headphones. The headphone amplifiers themselves aren't great of course, but since that's quite an easy job electronically they still don't have easily audible influence on the sound. One remaing problem is high volume levels, especially in mobile devices, for power-supply (as well as, possibly, heat dissipation) reasons.</p>

<p>You may try an external sound card, it <em>might</em> improve you listening experience; but perhaps not significantly.</p>

<h2>Headphones</h2>

<p>Like any kind of speaker device, those actually have more influence on the sound than any properly designed purely electronic component<sup>2</sup>. That's often not so much considered a flaw as a characteristic; HiFi speakers aren't really designed to transmit with flat response at all, but to transmit ""nicely sounding"", which obviously isn't quite well-defined.</p>

<p>Studio monitors and -headphones are, in principle, designed to operate as linearly as possible. Incidentally, this means they <em>don't</em> really sound ""good"": they're most of all supposed to <em>reveal</em> any issues in the material. Sound engineers value this, obviously. But again, <em>mastering engineers</em> anticipate that most listeners will use technically inferior speakers, and set up the mastering accordingly.</p>

<h2>Music source</h2>

<p>This, in a way, means the actual bottleneck is probably the orginal source; not the file format but the mastering. Indeed many of today's records are mastered quite horribly IMO, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grossly overcompressed</a> etc..</p>

<p>Of course this depends on what style of music you hear. Classical music and Jazz are least affected, Pop through Electronic and Metal are most. What can you do about it? It's nothing you could fix by buying better listening equipment; if anything you could get <em>worse</em> equipment to better match the master engineers' expectations.</p>

<p>Just try and be selective about what tracks you listen to, that's the advice I'd give you. A great recording<sup>3</sup> over 30$ equipment is much more enjoyable than a bad recording over 1000$ equipment.</p>

<p><hr>
<sup>1</sup>Actually, that's only true for asynchronous transport, as in your case. If you need realtime performance, then there are sure enough a couple of issues in the digital transmission.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Of course, I'm leaving out deviced <em>designed to alter the sound</em> here, like EQs etc..</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Sure enough, in the <em>recording studio</em> they will have needed expensive equipment. Recording has much higher demands (e.g. low-noise mic preamps) than listening.</p>

"Rough Idea of Time Spent Editing Videos","627","","<p>I currently am the Video guy for our company. We do video training for installs for automotive parts. I do the planning for the videos. I do the shooting of the videos. I do the editing of the videos. I do the final release of the videos.</p>

<p>My boss wants a report about the amount of time it should be taking me to do this. Its a fair question and I'm all about self improvement and figuring out where I can do my job more effectively, especially if it will help me get a raise or move up in the company. My question comes from the amount of time I should be allotting for the start to completion for a video. Its not my only job, but it is about 30-35 hours a week, so a huge portion.</p>

<p>So how much time should I be allotting for start to finish of a video. I have put together several of the parameters bellow.</p>

<p>SO lets assume I was going to release a 10 minute video on YouTube. </p>

<ol>
<li>I do my planning for the different shots I'm going to need.</li>
<li>I work with our other guy who is the ""Host"" or ""Talent"" on screen to get together what he needs to cover.</li>
<li>We start shooting, We do about 3 hours of shooting/installing, giving me what I need to work from.</li>
<li>I start editing the video, I join the audio, I sort through the footage, Pick all the different pieces I'm going to use, Cut in each scene (Which is rather easy because we shoot in consecutive order of the build), Lay in the intro &amp; outro graphics, Lay the sound effects/background music (Which is typically most of the video and the same), Export the video, Make any suggestions/changes from the installers, Build the video thumbnails.</li>
<li>I upload the completed video to YouTube, add to other website locations, send an email its been release, write any type of descriptions/keywords.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I know how long I'm spending on each video roughly, its about 2-3 weeks time per video, and sometimes even more than that. I have about 4 years of experience doing this. I also know that it varies from person to person based on skill. I do have plenty of room for improvement, I know that. How long <strong>SHOULD</strong> it take me to complete a project like this? Am I in the ball park? Am I running really slow? Or am I doing good for my time frame?</p>
","<p>This is a tough question because there are a ton of different factors involved here, from complexity of the video to the equipment you're working with to the NLE you use. However, the default formula we use to give time estimates to clients breaks down like this (I've run a small video production company for a few years working for a large variety and diversity of clients):</p>

<h2>Pre-Production</h2>

<p><strong>2 hours per minute of final product</strong>:
This is a number that can swing wildly in each direction, mostly depending on how much pre-production we have to do. For instance, if a client already has a script prepared, we typically don't have to do much besides potentially locking down a location, prepping a shot list, and lining up a crew. However, if a client comes to us and just says ""I want a video to express such and such"" (without a concept), we'll spend a large amount of time brainstorming, writing, etc. Typically we'll even send the client 3 fairly well-developed concepts to see which one they like best.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>

<p><strong>1 hour per minute of final product</strong>: This is the number that stays the most consistent across all our projects, and really boils down to only a few factors. The biggest factor is who we're working with - if we get to use our own (experienced) actors in the video, everything goes smoothly. If a company or organization wants to put their own people into the video, it takes longer because (most of the time) these people don't have acting experience and thus haven't memorized the script, aren't strong in staying consistent between takes, etc.</p>

<p>The other main factor in production time is the equipment you're using and how complex the shoot is. More cameras cuts down on production time because you can grab multiple angles at once (we typically shoot with 2 cameras at a time). A complicated shoot involving a lot of equipment set-up/breakdown will take much longer than a shoot with just a camera on a tripod. Set-up and breakdown of equipment (especially large equipment like a jib or dolly) can take a ton of time.</p>

<h2>Post-Production</h2>

<p><strong>1.5 hours per minute of final product</strong>: Like pre-production, this one can swing pretty wildly in either direction, but I almost never give an estimate of less than 1.5 hours/minute of final product. This one really depends on what exactly you're doing in your post-production workflow - are you just throwing clips together on a timeline and then exporting it? Or are you going through all the extra steps, like color correcting/grading, audio cleaning/mixing, adding titles, VFX, etc.? Typically, if we're on a deadline, we'll cut unnecessary steps from that workflow to get a video out on time (most clients may not care if you don't color grade a project simply because most people won't notice it if it's not horrible).</p>

<h2>Total</h2>

<p>This works out to around 4.5 hours of work per minute of ""final product"" (a 10-minute video would take 45 hours, for instance). Like I said, there's a ton of volatility to that number - we've knocked out a 4-minute video in 10 hours, but we've also spent 20 hours on a 1 minute video. The biggest thing I've learned while in this industry is that people who are unfamiliar with the process of video production <em>always</em> underestimate how long a video will take from start to finish. To do it right, it takes time. </p>

<p>In your specific case, it looks like your video has a decent number of angles, cuts, etc., and your production value is fairly high. Your videos are long, too, so I'd say 2-3 weeks of working 30-35 hours/week is definitely within the acceptable range.</p>

<p>So, should I get a new cable from EBay or buy a dedicated capture box?</p>
","<p>This is really going to depend on the quality of your camera and the quality of your VCR.  In general, the circuitry that is used to digitize an analog signal has grown by leaps and bounds in the past 10 to 15 years, but also VHS tapes and VCRs produce limited quality to begin with.   For maximum quality you will certainly want something with an S-Video input and a VCR deck with an S-video output to maximize quality.</p>

<p>As far as the line input goes, I'd probably favor the line input on a high quality camera from the end of the DV era over a cheap USB capture device, but a modern moderate or high quality capture device is going to do much better than even a high end in-camera analog to digital converter.  Even cheap USB devices now are most likely better than cheap camcorders or early camcorders in the DV era, but millage will vary depending on the specific device.</p>

"Split PGS subtitles (.sup file)","619","","<p>I'd like to know if there is any method to split a PGS format subtitle pulled from a bluray as a .sup file.</p>
","<p>Here is the structure of a .sup subtitle file and a link to the splitter I created. Information is either from linked reference or my own research.</p>

<p>The .sup subtitle splitter I created. <a href=""http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1737122"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1737122</a></p>

<p>The hex 0x50 0x47 are headers for sections in the .sup file, however there are multiple sections per subtitle line. There is always (in my experience) a 0x16, 0x17, 0x14, 0x15, and 0x80 flagged section for displayed subtitles. There can be multiple 0x15 sections if the bitmap data is large. There are also ""empty"" subtitles which are used to end a subtitle which only have 0x16, 0x17, and 0x80 flags. Subtitles only have a start time and no end time or duration, so a subtitle is ended by the next subtitle starting. So if two subtitle lines are separated by a time period, a blank subtitle section is used to end the first subtitle.</p>

<p>Referencing the linked page these are the flags each header can have.</p>

<pre><code>TIMES = 0x16
SIZE = 0x17
PALETTE = 0x14
BITMAP = 0x15
END = 0x80
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully explaining everything with hex code of a full subtitle should help. I separated each of the sections and truncated the palette and bitmap sections.</p>

00 01 E3 E0  time code
00 00 00 00  second time code (normally zero)
16           flag
00 13        data size
</code></pre>

<p>To get the time code to a usable form take the hex and convert to decimal, then multiple by 100,000 and divide by 9 to get nanoseconds.</p>

","<p>Pixel frequency, also known as <em>dot clock</em> is referring to the bandwidth of the projector's controller chip.</p>

<p>For a resolution a certain <em>data rate</em> is required to display all the data (not pixel frequency, see later) - it can be for example:</p>

<p>A resolution of 800x600 at 60 Hz would require:</p>

<pre><code>800 x 600 x 3 (RGB) x 60 Hz/2 (interlaced frame rate) = 43 200 000 bytes per second
</code></pre>

<p>or divided on 1024^2 = 41.2 Mb/s, as data rate with full 8-bit color-depth.</p>

<p>To calculate the projector/monitor's <em>bandwidth</em> you will need accurate timing measurement available, but you can get close by using the vertical frequency and compensate for VBLANK (vertical blanking which is a sync feature) with about 5% and HBLANK with about 30%:</p>

<p>So with 800x600 resolution at 60 hz:  </p>

<pre><code>800x1.3 x 600x1.05 x 60 = approx. 39 Mhz

<p>The closer these two results get the better it is as that will tell that the projector/monitor is capable to handle the needed data rate to get full resolution, color depth as so forth.</p>

<p>The bandwidth becomes a factor when showing video in particular.</p>

"How does HDR relate to color space and bit depth?","611","","<p>I'm not a photographer, but I'm struggling to understand HDR technology as it relates to TVs and monitors, so I thought this would be a good place to ask.</p>

<p>First, I got a good understanding of the terms ""color space"" and ""bit depth"" by reading this <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/50551/63891"">excellent answer</a>.</p>

<p>How does HDR technology relate to these terms? Is HDR simply a combination of a 10-bit color depth and really wide color space, or is there something more to it? </p>

<p>In the marketing language, certain areas of the screen (such as the rising sun) are said to be ""brighter"" than other areas of the screen on a HDR display. What does ""brighter"" actually mean here — does it just mean ""farther to the edge of the color space""?</p>

<p>I currently have a DELL U2410 monitor, which, as I understand, has a 12-bit internal processor and an 8-bit panel with FRC dithering, and supports an Adobe RGB color space. Even though this is not true 10-bit, will it produce a result similar to HDR if I use a device which can output HDR? I currently set the color space to ""sRGB"" since Adobe RGB looks too oversaturated. Could this be because my graphics card does not support a 10-bit output?</p>

<p>EDIT: I am talking about ""HDR"" specifically as it relates to how the term is used in modern 4K TVs. </p>
","<p>TV technology and video encoding is in principle outside the scope of this site. 
Still, as photographers we are presumably interested in new display standards that promise both more dynamic range and wider color gamut. HDR computer monitors <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/3154466/displays/jaw-droppingly-gorgeous-hdr-explodes-onto-pc-monitors-at-ces-2017.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">are coming</a>, so it probably won't be long before photographers too will be interested in HDR displays.</p>

<p>HDR by itself just means High Dynamic Range. Dynamic range is the brightness ratio between the brightest and the darkest parts. ""High"" is relative to what the sensor can capture or to what a standard display can show.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-dynamic-range_video"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HDR video</a> is one of several standards for video encoding. They have names like HDR10, Dolby Vision, and Hybrid Log-Gamma. They all support higher bit depth (10-12 bits), wider color gamut (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._2020"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rec. 2020</a> and/or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DCI-P3</a>), higher dynamic range, and 4k resolution. They are not compatible with each other, but some devices support more than one HDR standard.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-explained"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""HDR TV""</a> doesn't necessarily mean much, except that it will accept a HDR video signal and display an image. It does <em>not</em> necessarily mean that it can <em>display</em> the wider gamut and higher dynamic range, just that it can read the signals and show something, even if what it shows is plain sRGB with a mundane dynamic range.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-uhd-alliance-premium-certified/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""UHD Premium""</a> is a certification standard for displays that can actually <em>show</em> HDR. Requirements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimum 10 bit color</li>
<li>minimum 90% of the DCI-P3 color gamut</li>
<li>use a HDR transfer function <em>(The transfer function for sRGB is called 'gamma', it translates bit value to brightness value. HDR uses a different function so it can cover a larger dynamic range with a small increase in the number of bits)</em></li>
<li>either: Minimum 1,000 nits brightness and max 0.05 nits black level, contrast ratio 20,000:1 or better (for LCD displays)</li>
<li>or: Minimum 540 nits brightness and max 0.0005 nits black level, contrast ratio 1,080,000:1 or better (for OLED displays, they can't go as bright but have better black levels)</li>
</ul>

<p>Standard displays are 200-400 nits and rarely go beyond 1,000:1 contrast ratio. So a ""Premium"" HDR display has significantly higher peak brightness as well as an order of magnitude better contrast. </p>

<p>Brighter highlights, higher contrast ratios, and a different ""bits to brightness"" encoding/decoding all combine to enable the ""high dynamic range"" part of a HDR TV.</p>

<p>Color space and bit depth is only related to HDR in the sense that they are part of the same standards. Yes, you need more bits to represent a higher dynamic range without banding. But the larger color space is a different decision, it's more a matter of including enough improvements to make a new video standard worth the trouble. (4k is also part of the standard, and 4k is not related to HDR either.)</p>

<p>""The sun looks brighter on a HDR display"" means that a) the display emits more light in the brightest parts of the scene, and b) it may look even brighter because the rest of the scene can be dimmer without losing detail. </p>

<p>So it's a real improvement; the wider color gamut and higher dynamic range can  contribute to more vivid photos and video. </p>

<p>The caveat is that TVs/monitors may be sold as ""HDR compatible"" without any actual HDR capability in the display. The content needs to be made specifically for HDR to make use of the new capabilities. And for computer monitors, you need a graphics card that supports HDR output. </p>

<p>Adobe Premiere uses ""bins"" ""metadata"" and ""labels"" to organize media. Labels however are limited to about 6 I believe. Sure you can create a bunch of bins and copy and paste clips to use bins like keywords in a sense, however one of the great features of editing software is that clips show which parts of them are used in a sequence, when you copy and paste clips in the project panel you now have two separate entities, so if you where to use one and not the other, even though they are the same clip premiere will only show the one you used was used in a sequence. (Which kinda defeats the purpose).</p>

<p>How do you use keywords and or tags just like you can in Final Cut Pro X?</p>
","<p>Keywords are an optional field of the project panel. In order to view or add keywords, you need to set the project panel to <em>List View</em> (you can switch between <em>List View</em> and <em>Icon View</em> with the buttons in the lower left corner).</p>

<p>In the flyout menu of the project panel, select <em>Metadata Display…</em> to customize the columns of the list view to show whatever information you want it to. You will find the keywords in the category <em>Dublin Core</em>. Check keywords and click ok. You might have to resize the project panel (or remove the columns you don't need from the Metadata Display menu) in order to see the keyword column. You can rearrange the columns using drag-and-drop. Once you have added some tags to your clips, you can search for clips with specific tags using the search function of the project panel.</p>

<p>There's also some more useful metadata columns hidden in that menu that are not shown by default that you might find useful. For example, the category <em>Premiere Pro Project Metadata</em> has the entries <em>Video Usage</em> and <em>Audio Usage</em> that show you how many instances of a clip exist in your sequences in your current project. There are also fields for <em>Comment</em>, <em>Description</em>, <em>Scene</em>, <em>Shot</em> and much more. Using the Metadata Display menu, you can customize the metadata columns to only show those that you need for your workflow. </p>

<p>With the help of ExtendScript you can write very powerful extensions for After Effects and its very easy to get going with it. Just open up the ""Adobe ExtenScript Toolkit"" that gets installed with every CS suite and load up an example for After Effects and have a look at the JavaScript documentation. While you can also script with AppleScript and Batch Script the documentation for the JavaScript version is a lot better.
You can access it under the ""Help"" menu. Most importantly look at the After Effects Scripting guide. It can be found for different CS/CC versions <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/aftereffects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>What I would do is start to iterate through all your compositions, grab the current composition in your iteration, get an array of all the layer names in that composition and then iterate with that array through all compositions and compare the array with the array of all the other compositions. Best to not sort the arrays in case you used generic names for layers and unique layer ordering is important.</p>

<p>Unless you have micro changes in your duplicate comps like changed property values and keyframes this approach would be effective.
If you do have micro changes you would, after having fetched all comps with duplicate layers, also have to access every layer in your array and compare every property with the corresponding layer in the other comp.</p>

<p>You then delete all true duplicates of a comp and while doing that replace them with a link of your now unique comp in all occurrences in other comps.</p>

<p>Shouldn't be much code but it could take some time to write if you have never used Adobe ExtendScript.</p>

"In search of a Helmet-based steadicam solution for GoPro Hero 3","595","","<p>I recently tested my GoPro Hero 3 for the first time during a run in the park using a helmet mounting. It's not bad footage but it's very 'bouncy'. I've been looking at a few options to stabilize the camera. There are some interesting steadicam options out there and some very fine DIY videos on YouTube. However most helmet-based steadicam solutions involve mounting the camera on a long pole which includes a counter weight.</p>

<p>I'm going to be running the Tough Mudder (<a href=""http://www.toughmudder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toughmudder.com</a>) soon and I don't think sticking the rig of a long pole will be particularly convienent, least of all for the other runners whom I might injure.</p>

<p>Is there an alternative steadicam-style helmet mounting that I could buy or make?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, the physics of a Steadycam require a counterweight (sometimes provided by springs) and distance to minimize the impact of movement by using the inertia of the system.  The best you might be able to do in a small size would be a shock mount.  If you had a power source, you could presumably put a small gyroscope in to try and further stabilize the rotation, but that would become pretty (very) expensive really fast.</p>

<p>A shock mount is probably your best option within a semi-affordable range and will deal with the actual movements forward and backward, up and down, etc, but not rotation.  It does appear that people have made multi-axis gyro mounts that would work, but they've all been custom builds and the power and weight is still probably prohibitive to wearing it in a run.  It would also still have to be shock mounted to account for lateral movements as the gyro would only deal with rotation.</p>

"Editing 1440p @ 47 FPS in Premiere Pro CS6","594","","<p>I am attempting to edit the videos I've recorded with a GoPro Hero 3 in Premiere Pro CS6. However, the preview window jumps, is slow and not smooth at all. As this pretty much makes video editing impossible, I was looking for a solution.</p>

<p>Are there any settings in Premiere Pro CS6 which would fix this or are you guys able to recommend me another program for Windows 7 which has a comparable features?</p>

<p>My computer specs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32 GB</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i7-3820 @ 3.60Ghz (8 CPUS)</li>
<li><strong>Graphic Card:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670</li>
</ul>
","<p>This sounds like a hardware problem.  The playback engine in Premiere has been very, very fast since CS5, so it is unlikely to be a software problem.  The data rate for 1440p video at 47fps is going to be astonishingly high (170MB/sec once decoded, for comparison, 1080p 24fps is just under 50MB/sec) and extremely demanding on your system.  Based on your system specs, it probably isn't a processing or memory problem, particularly if you have CUDA enabled, however you may be running in to a bandwidth problem loading off your hard-disk or loading in to memory (depending on your memory speed).</p>

<p>It also may be an issue with the format of the video you are using.  Not all video formats are designed for random access.  Even with a very powerful computer, if the file format you are working with requires rendering out multiple frames from the latest key frame every time that you move your preview, you will hammer your computer far harder.  (In the worst case, you end up having to load over a dozen frames of video to get one frame.)</p>

<p>It also wouldn't hurt to double check if anything is bottle necking by looking at Task Manager when you are previewing video.  Does memory utilization or CPU get high?  I expect it will be hard disk access (which won't peak the CPU or memory utilization) but it doesn't hurt to double check.</p>

"Correcting video flicker problem caused by camera's auto white balance","592","","<p>I have shot a video with a handheld camera that uses auto white balance. Unfortunately, the auto white balance seems to have done more harm than good. The camera was readjusting the white balance every time when it was moved. The video ends up having many transitions from dark to bright then back to dark every few seconds throughout it. The video looks as though it was flickering in slow motion. </p>

<p>I have tried adjusting the colour balance of the video in After Effects but because the white balance by the camera was on every frame, a linear colour balance correction doesn't seem to help.</p>

<p>Is there any way to correct this problem without having to retake all my shots?</p>
","<p>Probably not easily.  You might be able to try applying a better auto-white balance and hope for the best.  You could also manually adjust it repeatedly and adjust the interpolation between values (on the animation curves) but this is highly time consuming and still won't get as good of a result as reshooting.</p>

<p>If reshooting is an option, it's going to probably be the quickest, easiest and best looking solution.  If not, then your stuck trying some very painful and time consuming adjustments.</p>

"Halogen brightness for video","592","","<p>I'm trying to get an idea of the brightness of halogen lights before I go and buy any. I'm going to be producing a music video and for some indoor scenes I'll need lighting. I'm on a small budget unfortunately so hiring hundreds of dollars of lighting is not on the agenda.</p>

<p>I was planning on getting some cheap work lights of 250W or 500W but I've heard people say that 500W lights are actually very bright and get rather hot.</p>

<p>If I was looking for an exposure at 1/50th of 1/100th (for 50fps shots) at f/2.8-4 at around ISO 100 or 160, will a 500W light be too bright? I obviously want the ISO to be as low as possible since I'm working with an APS-C DSLR, not a dedicated cinema camera.</p>

<p>I do have an ND4 filter on hand. The only remaining issue would be controlling the light from the work lights.</p>
","<p>If anyone was curious, I managed to pick up a 400W halogen work light (supposedly delivering equivalent to 500W) and the exposure within a few metres (3-4) was spot on. I also bought a 250W halogen that I would probably use more as a fill light as it's a stop or so darker.</p>

<p>At f/2.8, ISO 100-320, 1/100th at 50 frames per second, the exposure on the histogram was pretty well on the money.</p>

<p>And the light cost me all of $20. I filmed it at 3000K (approximate temperature of halogens) using the CINEMA pf2 profile on my Canon EOS 60D. The profile produced an almost completed colour grade.</p>

"After reading separate video and audio tracks (in Shotcut), just export a portion of it as one video","591","","<p>I am using Shotcut for my video editing (I am a beginner). I record one big video file, and one audio file separately, but when I load them into Shotcut actually I just need some portion of it. Is there a way then when I have read in the video and the audio into separate tracks to just export a portion of it (like from 1min - 2min or so)?</p>

<p>The way I do it now goes like this: I add them both to Shotcut, export everything, so that I end up with one big mp4 file. Then I reread this into Shotcut and just add the portion (with the blue/red-slider beneath the preview) I actually want (as a track), and then I export this again. But this additional step of exporting (and thereby rendering) everything I wish to skip, as it takes some time. So is there a way to do this?</p>
","<p>I am using Shotcut in version 17.03.02. There are probably more ways how you can accomplish this.</p>

<p>The simplest is to mark <strong>in</strong> and <strong>out</strong> points in you video after adding it to the playlist. You can do this using keyboard (I - for in) and (O - for out) also while playing the clip. </p>

<p>Then you can right click the file name in playlist and either <em>Replace</em> the clip with the new cut points or <em>Insert cut</em>, basically inserting a second clip with the cut points marked. Then you can append the file into the Video Track. Do the same with your audio file. Create cut points and append it to a new audio track. </p>

<p>You can do some additional trimming in the track editor. For example using the <em>Split At Playhead</em> and delete the parts you don't want. That way you can trim both files to the same length. Now you have to export the project. </p>

"How to deal with this heavily underexposed footage","588","","<p>I recently was at friends birthday with a few musical performances and this friend asked me to film the event. Unfortunately, it was really badly lit (I did notice it, but I couldn't do anything about it). So I had a bad feeling, but I shot as much footage as I could anyway. So, this is how it turned out:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ilghj.jpg"" alt=""original still""></p>

<p>With a luma curve adjustment, raised saturation and an orange-ish color-grading, it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/60f7U.jpg"" alt=""still with corrections""></p>

<p>If I lighten it up even more, it becomes even more grainy. Also, the missing color informations become more obvious: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xPqev.jpg"" alt=""still with corrections, lighter""></p>

<p>So, my question; should I rather sacrifice some visibility so that it looks not totally grainy (2nd picture) or lighten it up even more at the cost of strange-looking colors and very grainy scenes (3rd picture)? And, using either variant as a starting point, how could I further increase the quality of the result? Especially bring more color into it while maintaining a natural look and reduce the noise. I'm working with Premiere Pro CC. I've tried the <em>remove grain</em> effect in After Effects, but that didn't yield great results (I'm not sure if I got the settings right though, I'll try it again later). I also found the <a href=""http://www.neatvideo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Neat Video</a> Plugin for PP and AE, but I'm not making any money from this, so I'm not so keen on spending money on it ...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As requested, here are some <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7q73qgz5e013r0u/AAApYTMX0Kc7FAzMoN_SK4Yka?dl=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">uncompressed stills</a> (directly exported frames from Premiere). I've decided to go with the 'middle ground' option (uncompressed_graded.bmp).</p>
","<p>If this is no raw material, there is no additional pixel information to balance your colors and achieve a natural look. Only chance you have is to denoise your video and desaturate the colors. Try to find a good relationship between brightness and noise to get an acceptable result.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no good, free, build-in or open source solution at the moment. Denoising a video requires very complex algorithms, not only because every camera produces different noise types. Currently best approach are <a href=""http://cs.haifa.ac.il/hagit/courses/seminars/wavelets/Presentations/Lecture09_Denoising.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">wavelet algorithms</a>, but there are only 2 tools which use it:</p>

"how to do an amplitude modulation in Ableton Live","585","","<p>What I want is simple: I want to modulate the volume (amplitude) of one channel, with the amplitude of another channel.</p>

<p>A sidechain compression/gating won't do it either.</p>

","<p>If you have Max4Live (included in Live9 Suite), it should be easy enough to build a Live device that does the amplitude modulation exactly the way you want.</p>

<p>Otherwise, look for Ring Modulator and Amplitude Modulation VST plugins. The easy way to write a Ringmod plugin is to just do amplitude modulation. So the free plugins are likely to do what you want. Actually modeling an analog ring modulator takes more effort, but maybe <em>that</em> is the sound you are really looking for.</p>

<p>If you happen to have Absynth, I'm pretty sure you can accomplish AM or ring modulation on arbitrary incoming signals with that.</p>

"Video noise and harsh shadows on green screen caused by feet","585","","<p>We have a recurring shoot where we continue to run into the same two issues. Our set consists of a medical exam table sitting on top of a green screen. The talent sits on the exam table and we record 'Doctor/Patient interviews'. </p>

<p>ISSUE 1: When the talent is on the taller side, their feet hang down past the bottom of the exam table and create really harsh shadows on the green screen, making the footage very difficult to key.</p>

<p>ISSUE 2: The dark area on the front of the exam table, behind the talent's legs, is very noisy. </p>

<p>I believe these two issues are linked and both have to do with lighting. However, I have yet to find a permanent solution to either one of them. I am currently setting a small LED light in front of the camera that helps with the shadows, but it still isn't solving the problem. </p>

<p>Our camera is a Panasonic HMC150 and I use the 'Keylight' effect in After Effects to key the footage. Keying is very difficult around the feet shadows and some of the green reflection shows on the exam table, which in turn, ends up being keyed slightly creating a lot of noise. I use the 'Remove Grain' effect to help remove the noise.  </p>

","<p>To reduce or eliminate the greenish reflection on the front of the table, you can buy some dark gray or black construction paper, or something equally non-reflective, cut it to size, and tape it over the 2 dark rectangles on the front of the table.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You could point a semi-dim spotlight directly on that section of the green screen. Make sure to mask it so it doesn't hit the dark rectangles on the front of the table too much.</p></li>
<li><p>If the camera is always stationary, you could lower the camera slightly so the talent's feet never extend past the dark rectangle on the front of the table and into the green (as the tip of her left shoe does in the pictures you included). Then you can mask out that part of the shot instead of relying on the Keylight effect.</p></li>
<li><p>You could just move the camera about a foot closer to the talent so you crop out the bottom of the table (and the green in front of it). You can also do this by cropping the shot during post production.</p></li>

"What to do when camcorder angle does not cover entire area to record?","583","","<p>I'm trying to record an indoor soccer game from the middle of the bleachers. However, I cannot backup enough to get the entire field in the recording area.</p>

<p>I thought about fish-eye lenses but I'm guessing the video will be distorted near the edges where the goals are. I would like to avoid that if possible.</p>

<p>Another option is to try placing the camera near one of the edges of the field and backing up until the entire field is in the recording area.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I have no experience with videography so simpler solutions are preferred.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xqxSZ.jpg"" alt=""The field""></p>
","<p>You're correct that you either need to place the camera farther away until the entire field is in view, or use a wide-angle lens adapter (not necessarily ""fisheye"" but wider). For indoor soccer, clearly you're limited by the walls. </p>

<p>Presumably, you want to hit ""record"" and enjoy watching the game, rather than having to actively pan the camera back &amp; forth. Also, I'm presuming you only have 1 camera &amp; 1 operator, and you don't really intend to edit the footage together later... If that's the case, look for a wide-angle adapter &amp; put the camera as far away &amp; as high up as possible (a GoPro or similar as suggested previously might be easier to stick high up on the wall :))</p>

<p>For most basic consumer camcorders, you can get a wide-angle adapter to screw onto the front for about ~$40 (make sure the lens &amp; screw threads are the same size or find one specifically compatible for your camera). That should give you ~20-30% wider field of view. It won't be perfect &amp; might be slightly distorted, but it will capture more of the field than you would otherwise. </p>

<p>That still probably won't be enough to capture the entire game from mid-field, but it will get more of it. To fit the whole thing you'd likely need to be up on the ceiling or on a ladder at the top of the bleachers. Not safe, or easy to maneuver. </p>

<p>If you watch professional soccer matches on TV, you'll notice that they don't capture the entire field either, but instead follow the action of the ball. This is because 1) that's the focal point of the game and 2) In order to really see the whole field the camera would have to be so far away you wouldn't really be able to tell what's going on anymore.</p>

<p>There's little/no zooming (instead they cut between cameras). They tend to keep the player w/the ball just off-center, so there's room for them to run &amp; not go out of frame. Mid-range or close-up shots are usually done w/separate cameras, often at field level along the sidelines. As you'd suggested, you could put a camera near the goal line &amp; see the whole field, but then you're down low &amp; will only capture what happens nearby in that half of the field.</p>

"ffmpeg concatenation introduces video stutter but does not affect audio","581","","<p>I've gone through several different variants of this process and it always causes me problems.  I've gotten it working sometimes but it doesn't seem to be consistent.</p>

<p>I have a video camera which records AVCHD to MTS files, it splits files at 3.89GB.  Since its microphone is crap, I also record audio separately and have to sync them back up before editing.  The problem I have is that the audio recorder doesn't break files at the same times so I'll usually end up with 3 video files and 1 audio file.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering where things are going wrong in this process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Converted all the H264 MTS files to ProRes MOV files.  The editor handles ProRes better than the compressed files so I convert. <em>ffmpeg -i 00000.MTS -vf ""yadif=3:-1:1,mcdeint"" -vcodec prores -vprofile 2 -ar 48000 1.mov</em></li>
<li>Concatenated the 3 .mov files together.  At this point I have a file with video stutters every ~32 minutes, but the audio stays in sync with the video. <em>ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy full.mov</em></li>
<li>Extracted the audio to FLAC.  Imported into audacity, lined up the external audio with a clap and trimmed to length.  At this point both audio tracks line up, the external track is still in sync with the camera audio at the end.  Export the new external audio matched to the start and the length of the original audio. <em>ffmpeg -i full.mov -aq 256k full.flac</em></li>
<li>Recombine the large .mov file with the new audio.  At this point the audio that was just in sync with the original audio from the video files now goes out of sync when the video stutters. <em>ffmpeg -i full.mov -i full-tascam.flac -map 0:0 -map 1 -vcodec copy -ar 48000 full-tascam.mov</em>  </li>
</ol>

<p>What do?  I've had the same problem before introducing ProRes, just concatenating the MTS files into MP4 copying the video stream and adding the new audio.  Is there anything I can set while concatenating to remove the stutters, or to prevent them from throwing the new audio out of sync when I'm adding that track?</p>
","<p>For some reason I think this is avoided when using ffmpeg's concat PROTOCOL (<em>ffmpeg -i ""concat:...""</em>) rather than its concat DEMUXER (<em>ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt</em>).  Oddly, it's also slightly more convenient since using the demuxer requires me to create the text file with the file names in it while with the protocol I can just specify them on the command line, eg: <em>ffmpeg -i ""concat:00001.MTS|00002.MTS|00003.MTS"" -c copy output.mts</em></p>

<p>I'll need to confirm this later, I'm at the wrong computer but something brought the question to my attention so I decided to update it with new information.</p>

"Organizing a Multicam Clip in Premiere","576","","<p>In Adobe Premiere Pro 2015, you cannot sub-clip a multi-camera source clip, which is a shame, because sub-clipping is the most useful way I've found in Premiere for organizing segments of an extended interview. </p>

<p>I have a 2-hour multi-camera clip from an interview for a mini-documentary. My normal mini-doc/corporate workflow is:</p>

<ul>
<li>import footage</li>
<li>watch and tag (sub-clip) footage</li>
<li>create rough cut by adding sub-clips to a sequence and fine-tuning</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that I've got a multicam interview, I want to preserve this workflow or find an alternative. I've considered creating a sequence for each interview segment, but that requires a lot more interaction with the UI, slowing down the workflow. Yet it's important to organize these clips, because this interview may get used in multiple productions over the next several months, and I only want to watch and tag it once.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a way to tag multicam clips in Premiere that achieves the same organizational goal as sub-clipping?</p>
","<p>I was recently editing a 5-camera short film with Premiere. Over 7 hrs worth of footage. Lots of going back and forth over the clips. Lots of trying different angles. All that over many weeks. Yet, we never got lost or confused about what was happening or where things were.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create your multi-cam sequence.</li>
<li>Log all camera angles individually by using a lot of markers and/or extended markers. Label those markers clearly and consistently: mention the subject discussed and whatever interesting thing the interviewee does (facial expression, laughter, hand movement, etc.)</li>
<li>Maybe use a marker-color per subject-matter.</li>
<li>I would make sure to keep the original multi-cam sequence cuts-free. Just duplicate it as many times as you need to: that way you can always come back to it, a clean slate, if and when the cutting gets messy.</li>
<li>Edit the interview by copying and pasting bits that deal with similar issues to as many sequences as you have subject matters. Duplicate those initial ""sub-sequences"" and edit their duplicates down, as the director and you see fit.</li>
<li>Make sure that you name those ""subject-sequences"" clearly. Let's say one is about ""Boats"". Call the first one ""151031_Boats_E01"" for the date, the subject matter and the edit number. Then the duplicate would be called ""151031_Boats_E02"", etc. Duplication is you friend. Use bins, etc. I'm sure you have your workflow already anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>That way, you should be able to get back to your edit and the various subject matters over the course of a few months without finding yourself lost.</p>

"Old 8mm video recording tapes and standards","575","","<p>I want to transfer a set of old home video tapes recorded on a Sanyo VM-D66P. I do not have access to the camcorder anymore need to buy a camcorder that will play them so I can capture it via USB. The manual unfortunately does not make it clear precisely the type of tapes that it used.</p>

<p>The instruction manual gives the following hints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Television System: PAL, CCIR</li>
<li>Video recording system: Rotating 2-head helical-scan FM, color under system</li>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The logo on the manual I could find indicates that it was standard 8mm, not Hi8 or Digital8.  If you are in a PAL region, then most likely it is the PAL version of 8mm.  You should be able to use any PAL based 8mm playback deck or camcorder to play the tape back.  You then be able to use a standard video capture device to digitize the video that you playback.</p>

"1080p60 recording has very strong compression artifacts, default Neat Video not reducing them much","573","","<p>In attempting to record in the highest quality on a JVC GC-PX100 camcorder, I've been recording 1080p video.  Unfortunately, viewing the video upon edit shows very strong compression artifacts, which affect quality to the point that burning to DVD and burning to Blu-Ray end up with roughly the same results.  The video was taken on a reasonable photo tripod, so the camera was definitely steady, and the bulk of the video was unmoving walls with detailed paintings.</p>

<p>Adobe Premiere Elements 11 is what I'm doing for editing, and I've just tried the Neat Video plugin.  Unfortunately, while the default settings reduce the artifacts/noise in flat areas (cheeks, walls), but not along all edges (faces).</p>

<p>Essentially, the video is ""crunchy"", and that's visible on playback on a large TV.</p>

<p>Adobe Elements shows the .mts file from the camcorder is MPEG Movie, 1920x1080, frame rate 59.94, 48kHz audio, average data rate 3.3 MB/s (~34Mbit/s), pixel aspect ration 1.0.</p>

<p>VLC shows the .mts file from the camcorder is Codec H264 - MPEG-R AVC (part 10)(h264), 1920x1080, frame rate 59.940060, decoded format Planar 4:2:0 YUV, with A52 (aka AC3) 48kHz audio.</p>

<p>My goal is the highest quality result video, targeting Blu-Ray output.  My budget can handle a plugin fee, but not a new camcorder (spent too much on the add-on microphone).</p>

<p>So my questions in particular are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there better settings to increase overall quality during recording?</li>
<li>Are there better settings for Neat Video</li>
<li>Is there another way to reduce compression artifacts in HD video taken by a good consumer camcorder?</li>
</ul>

<p>EDITED TO ADD:
AJ, Jim, thank you for your answers; they led me to the regrettable conclusion that my expectations are too high for any 1080p60 mode at 35Mbit, and no 1080p30/25/24 mode is available on my model.</p>

<p>Even after the usual firmware update, and a factory reset as recommended by JVC Customer Support, the video is ""crunchier"" than I like.  There is no 1080p30 mode, unfortunately, and lesser modes have lesser bitrates as well.</p>

<p>After some experimentation, it appears that the AVCHD and MP4 1080p60 modes are more or less equivalent, with a possible slight edge to the AVCHD variant.</p>

<p>NeatVideo needs to have the plugin expanded and the Temporal Radius increased, as well as going into the settings to profile the video clip in question.  Edges remain crunchy, and dedicated ""reference"" profile video appears necessary to get good results.</p>
","<p>There is no way around needing more data rate to capture that much video information.  It sounds like the camera probably isn't actually capable of delivering 1080P/60 but that they use a very low quality version so they can slap the label on the box.</p>

<p>Data rates are generally measured in Mb(bits)/sec rather than MB/s, but even if your suggested rate actually is in MB/sec, 3.3MB/s for the video you are describing is near uselessly small and strong artifacting would be expected (particularly for a real time encoding) as the compression algorithm breaks down.</p>

<p>You need to use a mode that supports either a higher data rate or supplies less data to be encoded at that data rate.  There is no other real solution since there is no information there to actually use to fix the problem.</p>

I want to play this back in 50% speed in a project that outputs 25 fps. What is the proper way do achieve this? I can start a project with 50fps, import the media an choose ""50%"" speed reduction, but will this really intepret the media as 25 fps and output 25fps from the project? I suspect that it won't that it infact just will ""make up"" frames and ouput 50fps, and I don't want that. Any clue on how to fix this would be appreciated. </p>
","<p>Your project's frame rate should be the playback frame rate.  So if you want to output 25fps, make it a 25 fps project.  When you import other frame rates, many NLEs will attempt to automatically adapt the frame rate to your project rate.  If FCPX does not do this for you automatically, then you can manually set the timing of the clip to play back at 50%.</p>

<p>But when you make a 50fps project, you are basically making it impossible for FCPX to do the right thing.  Setting a clip to play back at 25fps in a 50fps project is meaningless.</p>

What other things have to be accomplished before we can reasonably expect to see x265 in wide use?</p>

<p>Are there any additional barriers to something like Handbrake being released?</p>
","<p>If you want to know when x265 is going to be in a usable state you will have to ask the developers about that. Though I'm pretty sure they don't know either.
If you want to know when h265/HEVC will be starting to get actually used I'd say earliest end of 2014 though more realistically in mid 2015. </p>

<p>Why? At the moment the devices most profiting from this new codec are mobile handsets that operate on limited data plans and 4K TVs.
As Smart TVs often use the same SoCs as smartphones and tablets both will happen pretty much at the same time.</p>

<p>Qualcomm already released a preview of its Snapdragon 805 which will be a SoC with h265 hardware decoding support. Thats the most important step towards the widespread adoption of a new codec, without hardware support most smartphones will have a hard time with playing back h265 content. SoCs that also support hardware encoding will come out in 2015 (f.e. Snapdragon 810). At that point all important factors on the consumer sides are ready for a widespread adoption. Now we just need to wait until even the low-end SoCs have hardware playback support.</p>

<p>Though that might go faster than expected with ARM v8 being around the corner at the same time. There might be some more rapid changes again in the Smartphone market.</p>

<p>Something like Handbrake will come around pretty quickly, its not all to hard. In the end its just a good user interface and some good presets. You just have to come up with it.</p>

"Recommendations for HD camcorder for all-day static recording?","570","","<p>I am working on a computer vision project where I will setup a camcorder in a room at around 6am and record people as they walk around and interact with things. The recording ends at 11pm. The room itself is huge (~50 ft tall) and I need to mount the camera either on the ceiling or on one of the rafters, so I'd prefer not to have to fetch an SD card at the end of each day if at all avoidable. The people are not moving super fast, but I will be doing motion analysis based on an image of the empty room, so it's important that the video be uncompressed (compression changes pixels and messes up the before/after diff for the motion tracking). Also, the people will be interested in viewing their actions later, so it needs to be in color and preferably HD. There is likely to be minor vibrations, so it also needs to be able to stabilize the video, though I imagine that is standard nowadays.</p>

<p>Given those requirements, does anyone have any recommendations for a camcorder? I'm looking in the sub-$400 range if at all possible.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Compressed video is fine after all. I was misunderstanding what kind of video my test data was using, but it seems to be compressed, so I can handle that. Also, if possible I'd like the camera to be able to just stream the video to a server on a local network so I can store it offline without having to retrieve the SD card.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: After some more looking, it does seem like there are 30M (~64ft) active USB extension cables. So it's possible that I could run a cable to a laptop on the ground and not need to worry about power or SD storage. As a result, I'm currently leaning towards an HD webcam like AJ suggested.</p>
","<p>Ok, so now that I got that comment out of my system, let me start by saying your expectation is 100% completely, totally and insanely unrealistic.  HD + uncompressed = a data rate measured in gigabytes (11.2 gigabytes to be specific) per minute (16.1 terabytes per 24 hour day) and is only available on very high end cameras (>$3000, without optics) price range.  Additionally, to not have to get the card every 30 minutes, let alone every day, you would need to have it wired in to a recorder elsewhere which means getting a record deck alone that will be over $600.  There is simply no possible way to accomplish all of your goals within an order of magnitude of your stated target cost.</p>

<p>For $6,000 or so, I could probably recommend a setup that would work nicely for capture and then you'd need another $4,000 or so just for the disk drives that could store it, but unless you can bear a reasonable level of compression, then it isn't going to be any cheaper.  Even SD would have problems running fully uncompressed for lengths of time without a dedicated professional deck, though SD might possibly drop the cost in to the 1 to 2k range.</p>

<p>While off topic for AVP, I would suggest that what you need to do is update your analysis to support compression.  Add a buffer that will recognize pixels that are close in color as the same and adjust as necessary until compression artifacts aren't recognized.  Unless people are all the same color as the floor, it should probably still be able to track pretty well.  </p>

<p>You'll need this anyway as from frame to frame, there are going to be variations in what hits the sensor even if you have a fully uncompressed signal.  Noise happens in the real world.  You have to deal with it.  The noise in the signal is going to be at least as much of a problem as most good compression, probably much more.</p>

"best alternative to QuickTime .mov","569","","<p>My company is stripping away QuickTime enterprise-wide, due to Apple dropping support for the format.  I use After Effects and Premiere, and others in my group are on Avid Workstations.  Occasionally when I create a video, I'm handed .mov files exported from Avid Media Composer and Sorensen Squeeze to work with in Adobe software, usually as QuickTime uncompressed.  Now that we are unable to work with QuickTime, going forward, what's the best codec alternative to import clean footage to work with?</p>
","<p>Apple is dropping support for the player, so no new releases, but the format remains and can be decoded by recent versions of CC without needing Quicktime to be installed. See</p>

"Can I shoot in 16:9 then change it to 4:3?","567","","<p>I'm trying to get the old film look with Canon 600D, so I will be shooting in 640*480 25 fps. But what if I shoot in 16:9 at 24 fps, will I be able to get the same 4:3 after editing? (The reason I'm asking this is films are 24 fps, 600D doesn't have 4:3 at 24 fps)</p>
","<p>Of course you can set your project up so that it will output a 4:3 video. However, keep in mind that there are only two ways to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nr. 1 You crop the video, which means you will lose stripes of the video at both the left and the right side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jcBNn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Nr. 2: You resize the 16:9 input video so that it fits in the 4:3 output video. I wouldn't recommend this though, since the video and everything in it will be deformed, which looks completely aweful.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if this is your input:</p>

You can usually configure it to constrain how much bandwidth it uses, which folders you do and don't want backed up, and maybe even when backups occur. And if you have a very large initial backup, they'll even send you a hard drive to back it up to. You send it back once the backup has occurred. From then on, it's incremental over the internet.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf ""crop='if(gte(iw,ih),ih,iw):if(gte(ih,iw),iw,ih)', scale=640x640"" \

<hr>

<p>The framerate stored in the container (<code>tbr</code>) is 600, whereas the reported fps of <code>118.99</code> is arrived at by counting the number of video packets and dividing by the total duration. If this is not a variable frame rate stream, then add <code>-r 118.99</code> as an output option.</p>

<hr>

<p>For older versions,
Alternatively, output to MKV i.e.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf ""crop='if(gte(iw,ih),ih,iw):if(gte(ih,iw),iw,ih)', scale=640x640"" \
   -vsync 0 -an -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.1 -preset veryslow -crf 20 output.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>If you then mux the MKV to MP4,</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i output.mkv -c copy output.mp4

"Codec genealogy / kinship: DivX, MPEG-4 Part 2, H.263","561","","<p>Yes, I know, H.264/AVC is here for everyone, and we're moving (slowly) towards H.265/HEVC, so why bother with these historic formats? Well, just because it's history. I admit my research has been limited to Google/forums/Wikipedia, but I haven't managed to get the relationship between these codecs straight.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DivX"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia DivX</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two DivX codecs; the regular MPEG-4 Part 2 DivX codec and
  the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DivX Plus HD codec.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, the latter doesn't matter here, that's just their H.264 implementation. But this does seem to state that the first and famous DivX <em>is</em> an MPEG-4 Part 2 implementation.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_2"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia MPEG-4 Part 2</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several popular codecs including DivX, Xvid and Nero Digital implement this standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, but wasn't DivX some kind of rogue development, decompiled Microsoft code, then modified, and even the Microsoft code being a modification of MPEG-4 Part 2?</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.263"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia H.263</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MPEG-4 Part 2 is H.263 compatible in the sense that a basic H.263
  bitstream is correctly decoded by an MPEG-4 Video decoder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there's overlap between the two, but one is for movies and such (MPEG), the other for teleconferencing and such (ITU), so their specced out for different contexts.</p>

<p>Sorry for the confused question … guess what I'm looking for is a mental map of these codecs with their relationships and how they came about and in how far they are the same and/or different.</p>
","<p>H.263 was a sole development of the ITU but I wouldn't bother all too much with the specified use case of video conferencing. It's a codec with the main purpose of improving the compression compared to older codecs which of course is beneficial for video conferencing where bandwidth is a very limiting factor, especially at the time the codec got developed.</p>

<p>The MPEG then developed MPEG4-Part 2 which is based upon H.263 and offers bit-stream compatibility to the base-line level of h.263, meaning there is a h.263 compatible bit-stream in an MPEG4-Part 2 encoded video that you could call the basis for the actual MPEG4-Part 2 video stream that extended the h.263 compatible stream. So MPEG4-Part 2 offers a few more features than h.263 but essentially they are very closely related.</p>

<p>With MPEG4-Part 2 started this weird age of many companies making their own implementation of these two codecs resulting in a few new container formats that were only used by these specific implementations f.e. RealMedia's .rmf/.rmvb or DivX's altered version of AVI, .divx.
RealMedia even made their own codec again based on h.263. A horrible age of a ton of different formats that needed their own browser plugins and players because they weren't fully compatible to each other, either because of their container or slight alterations to either h263 or MPEG-4 Part 2.</p>

<p>Which made this codec generation a bit special, while .MP4 was already present at the time in an early form it was barley used as the container format for MPEG4-Part 2. So h.263 and MPEG-4 Part 2 was found in a ton of different container formats unlike h.264 which has is also found in several container formats but with the intended container format MP4 being the defacto standard that is found everywhere. The most popular alternative being the open source Matroska container format (.mkv/.mka). Apple's QuickTime .mov also supports h.264 but even in the Apple Ecosystem MP4 is dominating. In my opinion the biggest reason why h.264 is such a huge success today.</p>

<p>DivX began as a reversed engineered version of Microsoft's MPEG4-Part 2 implementation. At that point there was no company behind DivX, it gained popularity because of its good compression at that time and also being free to use.
After DivX made it into a company they revamped the code for the codec as it was still based on some Microsoft code.</p>

<p>Though it still was an MPEG4-Part 2 implementation after the rewrite and became a pretty popular codec that was supported by a lot of DVD players at the time. Some developers of DivX went on and made the open source version called Xivd (that used AVI instead of .divx) that gained a lot of popularity in the movie ""pirating"" scene and was their standard for encoding videos for several years until h.264 came along. Though even after h.264 was readily in use by consumers Xvid was still used for a few years because of it's good understanding in the scene. It became somewhat of an art to encode movies in Xvid because of all those sophisticated encoding options available in the Xvid encoder.
Xvid had a few advanced features that weren't implemented in DivX which made videos encoded with those feature in-compatible with DivX certified devices.</p>

<p>Since MPEG4-Part 2 the MPEG and ITU-T are jointly developing codecs, H.264 being their first co-operation. This is the reason why the codec is often referred to as h.264/MPEG4-4 AVC. MPEG-4 AVC being the MPEG's/ISO name for the standard and h.264 that of the ITU-T. Different names but identical standards. The same goes for h.265/HEVC.</p>

<p>I hope that helped a bit clearing things up, though a lot of this is also knowledge taken from Wikipedia, so it might not be new to you but I tried to put it an order that made sense.</p>

<p>The reason I need it, is that file chokes on my Ubuntu 14.04 with VLC and I couldn't even watch it. It took few days to recode the videos, and I do not want to run into the same problem again. If I know the camcoder model and mode, I can to ask people to use different camera or settings.</p>

"GoPro Footage with Adobe Premiere is stuttering","549","","<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I searched many internet sites but i can't handle this problem.</p>

<p>My PC:</p>

<ul>
<li>6 GB RAM</li>
<li>4* 2.4 GHz CPU</li>
<li>1 GB Radeon GPU</li>
<li>SSD for System and Program</li>
<li>HDD for Video footage</li>
<li>Software: Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 with TotalCode Package.</li>
</ul>

<p>Video footage: </p>

<ul>
<li>Captured with GoPro</li>
<li>1920*1080</li>
<li>29,97 fps</li>
<li>MP4 Format</li>
<li>data-rate 35140 kBit/s</li>
<li>Clip 28s, 123 MB.</li>
</ul>

<p>When i open this Clip within Adobe Premiere, create a sequence from the clip and try the preview the first 2 sec will play smooth and after that the video is jumping and stuttering or after running 2 sec the preview freezes. No effects applied. (CPU Usage ~50%, all cores)</p>

<p>So my Sequence settings are: Rovi TotalCode AVC-Intra 100, 1920*1080 30 fps Non-Drop-Frame-Timecode. No matter if i choose the TotalCode renderer or the Mecury Renderer. Video preview is set to AVC Intra-Class 100 1080 24p (or 30p or 60i - no difference). 
Video preview format makes no difference between full, 1/2 or 1/4.</p>

<p>I think because i created the sequence from the clip, there is no red/yellow/gren bar over the clip in the cutting window. </p>

<p>I get better results if i create a 720p sequence (for example: For editing 1280x720 AVCHD type video. Widescreen NTSC video (16:9 progressive). 29.97 fps 48kHz (16 bit) audio.). When i insert a clip and preview it the video stutters and jumps. But now i have the yellow bar. If i render the whole working area the preview plays smooth.</p>

<p>Okay - now i would say: its my fault, my PC has not enough power.</p>

<p>BUT:</p>

<p>if i convert the MP4 via GoPro Studio to avi (Medium resolution) with the same specs (1920*1080*29,97) i got a 520 MB file (so roughly 4x the size of the original video).</p>

<p>When i use this clip instead of the MP4 the preview will play smooth (or nearly smooth) (CPU usage ~50%, all cores). </p>

<p>So Adobe Premiere has a problem with a data-rate of 35140 kBit/s but not with 151182 kBit/s on my PC? Hard to understand that this should be a performance issue...</p>

<p>I also tried to copy the clip to my SSD and start playing it, but nothing happens. Also tried to safe my project files on my SSD, not working.</p>

<p>I also tried to change the optimize rendern setting between Memory and Performance - nothing changed.</p>

<p>I saw this question:
<a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/10361/adobe-premiere-is-lagging-in-preview-window"">Adobe premiere is lagging in preview window</a> -> Because of the mentioned AVI i don't think it has something to do with the data size. </p>

<p><a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/9976/editing-1440p-47-fps-in-premiere-pro-cs6"">Editing 1440p @ 47 FPS in Premiere Pro CS6</a> -> Much higher data-rate and video quality.</p>

<p><a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/8133/adobe-premiere-preview-video-lagging"">Adobe Premiere preview video lagging</a> -> also talks about data rate (think this doesn't apply because of described avi/mp4 behavior)</p>

<p>Does anyone have some more ideas? Of course i could just convert 20 GB from mp4 to avi, but i'd like to safe this additional space on my hdd.</p>
","<p>The reason Premiere runs just fine with a massive file but struggles with a smaller file is the issue of data compression. Many people (logically) believe that the two tradeoffs between high and low compression codecs is information vs. space, and that codecs with more information will take more processing power to process. This is actually not the case. While more compression will cause a loss of visual information, it also makes the data more difficult to process because the CPU (or the GPU in the case of accelerated hardware) has to decompress the codec information before it can be displayed. This means that codecs like h.264 and VP9 are more difficult to process than DNxHR and Prores.</p>

<p>If you can give more information about your CPU and GPU, I can adjust this to be more useful to you. The main issue I see in your specs is a mediocre CPU and GPU. The all-intra bit encoding (all-intra isn't technically a codec, just a means of storing data within h.264) uses single-frame compression. This helps retain more information and improves scrubbing performance within a video editor, but it makes playback more difficult than a normal h.264 encoding. While I'm no expert on the subject, I imagine that any hardware h.264 acceleration your computer has may not be able to process all-intra.</p>

<p>My personal recommendation would be to upgrade your GPU to something like a GTX 950 or a GTX 960, or simply convert your files to a visually lossless format such as DNxHR before you begin editing.</p>

","<p>On camera viewing is limited by the low resolution of the lcd-display of the camera. Maybe there is the same issues but you just don't notice them on the small display?</p>

<p>As for what might be causing this, without seeing a sample video, I'd suggest a slow memory card. Would you get these quality issues if you shot a video with one step lower quality? I would buy/borrow a faster or at least better quality memory card and see if the problem is solved.</p>

What I think about this problem: at the moment in cuda decoding we can use only 2 deinterlace variants: </p>

<ul>
<li>-deint 1 it's bob deinterlacing,</li>
<li>-deint 2 it's adaptive deinterlacing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these variants are increase bitrate, because after deinterlacing each field(half of frame) displaying as frame (framerate is doubled) Bitrate is grow and if fps is variable we got timestamps issue. And when we enable drop second field then everything looks fine with bitrate and timestamps.</p>

","<p>HDMI does support audio, but it is possible that either the PMW-EX1R doesn't output audio over HDMI (which would seem odd to me, but is possible).  It is also possible that the settings are wrong on the Vidiu.  The Vidiu appears to support audio input from either the HDMI port itself or a line input.  If it is expecting signal on the line input, it might ignore the HDMI audio.</p>

<p>I'd check the documentation for the Vidiu to see if you can find anything about that since I don't see anything in the PMW-EX1R documentation to answer it.  You could also try plugging the PMW-EX1R in to another HDMI device to see if you get audio.  If not, you can also try running the audio output of the camera in to the line input of the Vidiu and monitor off of the headphone jack of the Vidiu.</p>

<p>My google searching has turned up several sites with 10-bit builds from 2013, 2016, and so on, but nothing consistent over time.</p>

<p>Before I go to the trouble of trying to set up a way to build this from source, I just want to confirm-- there's no site regularly providing 10-bit Windows builds of ffmpeg, right?</p>
","<p>Not quite. The x264 encoder, specifically, can be compiled with either 8-bit or 10-bit support, but not both.That restriction doesn't apply to x265 or any other encoders that I can think of. So, unless you need to encode to H.264 10-bit using x264, the regular builds of ffmpeg are fine.</p>

I saw a lot of time similar clips on youtube and always shot it is just a set of animated photos. Am I right? If yes, is there any special name for this approach? Or is it just an accelerated video?</p>
","<p>I think what you're thinking of is time-lapse photography. In a sense it <em>is</em> animated photos, except that the ""photos"" are captured with a video camera. </p>

<p>You can certainly Google time lapse and get hundreds of good ideas for creating time lapse photography, there are two methods for doing it--in-camera, and post-production. </p>

<p>For in-camera, you're generally going to be shooting 1 frame every x seconds. The larger ""x"" is, the longer the time lapse will last, and the more time between each frame. I usually run some tests starting at 1 frame every 30 seconds and adjust from there. It take a lot of time to test, since you have to go through about 200 frames to get a true sense of what the motion looks like.</p>

<p>In post-production, you would just take the 1hour clip you photographed in real time, tell the software to make it, say 30 seconds, and the software will automatically pick out the frames it'll show you during playback. Again, it's like animated stills, one frame at a time. </p>

<p>The principle is the same: normal film/video is 24/25/30 (depending on your standard) frames every second, you compress the time by INCREASING the time interval between frames. Instead of 24 frames per second (fps), 8 fps will give you fast motion and 1 frame every 8 seconds will move so fast it's a time lapse clip. </p>

<p>Whether that technique happens in-camera or in the post production proceess is up to you. </p>

<li>quad core i7?  (currently dual core)</li>
<li>16GB RAM or more?</li>
<li>discrete GPU?  or more recent Intel Iris would be enough?</li>

So, I imagine <code>ffmpeg</code> picks the highest one from the input... but is this specified anywhere?

       By default, ffmpeg includes only one stream of each type  
       (video, audio, subtitle) present in the input files and   
       adds them to each output file.  It picks the ""best"" of    
       each based upon the following criteria: for video, it is  
       the stream with the highest resolution, for audio, it is  
       the stream with the most channels, for subtitles, it is   
       the first subtitle stream. In the case where several      
       streams of the same type rate equally, the stream with the
       lowest index is chosen.

","<p><code>r_frame_rate</code> is ""<em>the lowest framerate with which all timestamps can be represented accurately (it is the least common multiple of all framerates in the stream).</em>""</p>

<p><code>avg_frame_rate</code> is just that: <code>total duration / total # of frames</code></p>

<p>You can just specify <code>-r 30000/1001</code> to maintain the average rate (near-abouts). You don't specify which format you're outputting to, but for MP4, ffmpeg defaults to constant-frame rate, where it picks <code>r_frame_rate</code> as the value. It will then duplicate or drop frames to keep that rate. Use <code>-vsync vfr</code> to keep the variable rate.</p>

"Do internal SSDs challenge the conventional wisdom of storing digital assets on external ""scratch"" disks?","530","","<p>I've heard that all project assets should be stored on a separate ""scratch"" disk for the sake of increased performance. I'm wondering if that conventional wisdom holds even when your ""scratch"" disk is HDD and your internal disk is SSD. (I'm aware that the cost/capacity ratio is lower for HDDs. My question concerns performance issues, not capacity.)</p>

<p>Here's how my question originated: I am experiencing lag using my mid-2012 MacBook Air (i5, 8GB RAM) to edit Final Cut Pro X. I'm wondering if re-arranging my assets would stand a change of improving performance. Here's where things are right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>The application (the *.app file for Final Cut Pro X) is on my internal SSD.</li>
<li>The library (the *.fcplibrary file) is on my thunderbolt-attached HDD.</li>
<li>The digital assets (stills and video) are on the same external HDD.</li>
</ul>

<p>My library file merely references the digital assets; I am not copying them into the resource fork. For that reason, my library file is small enough that I could store it on my local drive. The new arrangement would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>The application (the *.app file for Final Cut Pro X) is on my internal SSD.</li>
<li>The library (the *.fcplibrary file) is <em>on my internal SSD.</em></li>
<li>The digital assets (stills and video) are on the same external HDD.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, would I be breaking some law of the universe with this configuration? And where did the conventional wisdom on ""scratch"" disks come from, anyway? Does it still apply to SSDs? (Again, in terms of performance only please, not capacity.)</p>
","<p>Scratch disks should never be external.  I'm not sure where you heard that.  External drives can be used for long term asset storage, but it is best to move assets local to work on them.</p>

<p>The point of scratch disks is to be the highest speed work area you have available to work from.  Scratch disks are used for data that needs to be moved in and out of memory quickly, so internal SSDs are the best bet.</p>

<p>The one thing you don't want to do is you don't want assets and scratch disks on the same magnetic drive because of seek time.  This isn't a concern with SSDs though, so you can generally have them on the same drive.  If you are working with very large files, then there may be a bandwidth advantage to having them on different SSDs, but in order of importance you want memory to be the fastest possible, then scratch disk, then working asset storage, then long term asset storage.</p>

<p>The point is to keep data supplied to the CPU and GPU as much as possible.</p>

"Usage of Target and Maximum Bitrate with the H264 Codec in Premiere Pro","529","","<p>When exporting a video using the H264 Codec with a variable bitrate in Premiere Pro, you can set the target bitrate and the maximum bitrate. I would like to know how those work together and if there is any rule of thumb on what to set them to.</p>

<p>So AFAIK, the target bitrate is the average bitrate that the encoder will try to achieve by balancing out parts of the video where more or less information is required respectively. In that case, what is the purpose of the maximum bitrate setting? Is it the highest possible bitrate that won't be ecelled at any point of the video? Or can the encoder actually exceed the average bitrate over the amount speficied as target bitrate and the maximum bitrate is the highest possible <em>average</em> bitrate that the resulting video can have?</p>

<p>Also, how can I determine a good value for the maximum bitrate depending on the target bitrate? Let's say I export with 1, 10 or 20 MB/s (as my target bitrate), what should the maximum bitrate setting depend on?</p>
","<p>Sondell spelled it out correctly. </p>

<p>You use the <strong>Target</strong> to size your final output file, as VBR will be used. AME will then try to average as close as possible to ""average out"" to your target, yet the actual bitrate could be much lower, or up to your Maximum Setting. </p>

<p>The <strong>Maximum Setting</strong> is in place because of bottlenecks which exist for playback; for instance, many Blu-Ray players cannot read anything higher than 30 Mbps. DVD Caps around 9 mbps I believe. </p>

<p>The one part that I would like to point out is I recommend always using 2-Pass VBR, never one pass; unless your content is very consistent frame for frame. </p>

<p>AME/PPro <strong>lack</strong> a <strong>""Minimum BitRate""</strong>; which is a shame. Using VBR 1 Pass can cause pixelation issues; such as when a camera flash goes off - blowing out to near all white a single discreet frame. As a 1 Pass encode <strong>does not</strong> pre-analyze the program stream prior to setting the bitrate for a given frame set; a one pass VBR can cause artifacting after a camera flash; or a white or black hard edit to picture. </p>

<p>Also, any flickering type of video as well, such as strobe lights, can also cause this. Basically; if your image goes from flat color (any color) to complex picture/moving image in a 1-2 frame span... there can be trouble. </p>

<p>This occurs because it sees the flash as a blown out white image... thus AME drops the bitrate down very low (think under 0.5 Mbps); because after all; its just a frame of white... high bit rates are not needed. </p>

<p>The issue is that AME, its scheme for how it ramps up and down the bit rate is not fast enough; when using 1 Pass VBR. So after a camera flash goes off; your next frame, or even next two frames; could appear blocky, as the VBR bitrate has not ramped back up fast enough, and the flash lasted for only a single discreet frame. </p>

<p>2 Pass; while it takes longer; does a much better job handling this. </p>

<p>To be perfectly honest; I master nearly all of my content using CBR. While this goes against the mainstream norm; I know what bitrates are needed for what quality I desire; I'm not happy with the 1 Pass Encoder Issues; and 2 Pass is a time consuming render. </p>

<p>There are cases where 2 Pass is necessary; such as long form online content delivery, but for most outputs CBR is fast, clean, and consistent. </p>

","<p>I did a test for you and Larry is right ... Normally if the footage or file was anything other than 1440x1080, all you would need to do it set your Spatial Conform to none. However, in this instance FCPX is forcing a size based on the magic 1440 number. To correct this, select your clip and click the drill down triangle under scale in transform. Change just the X: scale to 75% because 1440 is 75% of 1920. That should do it!</p>

","<p>There are a few things you can do to get this look, first, use an artificially low resolution.  A lot of early graphics generators were done on things like the Amiga Video Toaster at 320 by 240 resolution.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can get the background look by making a normal gradient in Photoshop and then reducing the color depth substantially.  You can either reduce to 8 bit color or simply use a GIF with dithering turned on and lower the number of colors until you get the desired result.</p>

<p>Use classic pixel fonts for the lettering.  There are literally hundreds of possibilities out there to choose from, so you best bet is to look through something like Google fonts until you see something you like.</p>

<p>Finally, use interlaced video and run a couple interlaced to non-interlaced and back conversions to add the scan line related issues typical of old footage.  If you have an old VCR, try recording the video through a couple generations of VCR recording too and it will give it some nice analog degradation to really maximize the feel.</p>

When I tried to do this with the mp4 that Snagit11 created, deleting a few seconds of video would actually delete a couple of minutes. I tried it multiple times and it was very repeatable. It got the starting point of the cut correct but it didn't get the stopping point even close. I'm not sure if this is a problem on the Snagit11 encoding side or on the QT pro side. I've never tried to edit an MP4 before. I don't see why this wouldn't be possible and I can see how I might lose <em>some</em> precision in adjusting playheads on an already compressed format but to miss by a couple of minutes seems a wee bit extreme.

<p>Editing software usually prefers 'linear' formats (aiff or wav for audio, .mov or similar for vids) whereas mp4 is heavily compressed and 'lossy'. Also, the key frame rate is very poor (300 I think) so that might explain some of your edit problems. The only workaround I can find is to open in QT and re-export, but the results are pretty ugly! Saving to mp4 for final product? Why not - it looks pretty and the file sizes are good. Working with mp4 in the edit? Hell no :)</p>

"how to measure bitrate of video over time","516","","<p>Given an encoded video file with non-constant bitrate, how would one analyze the bitrate over time? So far I found one old program that produces a bitrate plot, but none that can give the raw data of the encoded frames.</p>

<p>I think bitrate data should be generated by averaging the size of a set of frames spanning 1 second--i.e. frames with a DTS belonging in that interval. So a 10 second video would have 10 data points describing the encoder input bitrate. Though I am curious to hear alternative ways of calculating bitrate.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get the size of each (encoded) frame? preferably with windows software. I know it is trivially easy for an uncompressed source (resolution * bitdepth * time).</p>
","<p>It does not make sense to speak of the size of an encoded frame in an inter-coded video stream, which is typical of MPEG-<em><code>X</code></em> videos. I-frames are self-contained but P- and B- frames are predicted frames and the final decoded result uses data from various inputs. On the other hand, the size of a single Group of Pictures (GOP) may be a meaningful measure.</p>

<p>The FFmpeg segmenter in combination with a compatible demuxer can break apart the video stream at GOP boundaries. By specifying an ultra-low time for segment size, you can ensure that each segment contains 1 GOP. Running a ffprobe on each segment will then provide the bitrate for that GOP.</p>

<p>I tested the command below on MP4s which had 1) a variable-sized GOP, 2) an intra-coded scheme and 3) fixed GOP of unusual length (11 frames), and each output had the expected result.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -an -c:v copy -segment_time 0.00001 -f segment i%0d.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Each segment contained exactly 1 I-frame (each segment of the intra input contained exactly 1 frame in all).</p>

<p>Running ffprobe on each segment gives a bitrate reading:</p>

<pre><code>Duration: 00:00:00.37, start: 4.466016, bitrate: 1539 kb/s
Stream #0:0(eng): Video: h264 (High) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p,

"Scaling videos of variable size to a fixed aspect ratio","514","","<p>I have 45 videos of varying aspect ratios and resolutions.
I need to scale all of them so that they fit neatly inside a 640x360 (16x9) container with the following specs:</p>

<p>16x9, 640x360, 1600kbps, H.264, MP4, progressive, 29.97</p>

<p>For example, some videos might be 512x12, others might be 480x320, but they all have to fit, scaled and centred, inside a new 640x360 output video.
If a video is not wide enough to fill that space, black bars should be added on the left and right.</p>

<p>Is this possible with ffmpeg?</p>

<p>Here's the code I've been toying with so far:</p>

<p><code>

<p>This seems to do everything I need, except for dynamically scaling to that fixed resolution.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to achieve the result I'm looking for?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

       -vcodec libx264 -b:v 1600k -bufsize:v 1600k -r 30000/1001 output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>The scale filters use the conditional <code>if(a,b,c)</code> expression i.e. <code>if a then b else c</code>. I check if the video is wider than 16:9. If yes, I scale the width to 640 and scale height to preserve proportion. If not, I scale height to 360, and keep width proportional. Then the result is padded out to 640x360. The setsar is used to make sure ffmpeg registers the video as square-pixel.</p>

","<p>Nikon D3300 supports AF-S and AF-F modes for video recording. AF-F helps you to keep focus without touching the shutter release button. <a href=""http://www.dummies.com/photography/cameras/nikon-camera/nikon-d3300-focus-modes-for-live-view/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> says that you never touch the shutter release button in AF-F mode. Just turn live view on, switch your focusing mode to AF-F, and wait until the camera focuses by itself (unlike what you do with a normal autofocus system while taking stills). Once the camera has focused, you can press the record button. Focus will be updated automatically.</p>

<p>I usually use manual focus, and tried AF-F to answer your question. It works well, except under low-light conditions (that's the reason for some issues, I think).</p>

"Would rendering After Effects project in Premiere Pro decrease quality?","512","","<p>I have created a motion logo using After Effects. Now, I want to render it in <strong>H.264</strong> or <strong>MP4</strong> format. Now, there are <strong>3</strong> ways for it:
1. Using Media Encoder
2. Export as Premiere Pro Project in After Effects and Use it in Premiere Pro
3. Save the Project as After Effects project and Import it in Premeire Pro</p>

<p>Now, what I want to ask is about quality of the video. Would all ways yield same quality for same format? Or There's difference between them in terms of quality? If yes, what would be best?</p>

<p>My <strong>2</strong>nd question is: I'm making a short video like a Movie trailer. I would create the scenes in <strong>Pr</strong> and the Motion Logo (which I've already created in After effects) in <strong>Ae</strong>. In what way should I render them (I need <strong>MP4</strong> video)? Import the Motion Logo project in Premiere Pro and render both Logo and Video <strong>OR</strong> both Video scenes and Logo in Media encoder?</p>

<p>NOTE: I'm asking these questions in terms of quality of Motion Logo and Video scenes, not in terms of ease of usage.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>Importing from AE using dynamic linking and rendering in Premiere or Media Encoder will yield the same quality, but it does give you a little less control over the render settings. </p>

<p>While in AE you can choose whether to render with frame blending , motion blur, draft settings and so on, Premiere will always render your AE comp with the current settings. So when you're setting up your final render in Premiere, make sure you jump over to AE and turn on motion blur and frame blending and check that all your layers are rendering at full quality, not draft. Most of the time you <em>won't</em> want these on while you're editing because they slow down the preview so much.</p>

<p>As far as quality goes I believe that it uses the same render engine, so don't obsess about it. In fact re-encoding from an After Effects render is probably more lossy than importing using dynamic linking, because of the two compression stages. <strong>But you will never <em>ever</em> notice the difference one way or the other</strong>, trust me. Any miniscule losses due to things like quantisation errors and so on are going to pale into insignificance with quality lost in the compression to MP4. </p>

<p>Use the way that makes it much easier for you. For me that's importing via dynamic linking, allowing me to change things in the AE project without re-rendering all the time and having great big render files all over the place.</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>How can I encode them so that each image is an Iframe at that given interval ?</p>

<p>Also possibly this is not what I want to do . I'm not sure if its mandatory to have videos have their Iframes at a fixed interval ( forgive my naivety about the subject )</p>

<p>Hopefully the images would interpolate between each other smoothly ( with a feel of motion ) . I can imagine a way to do it by just creating my own in-between images by interpolating in some way between two frames ( no chance I do as good a job as encoders already do ). </p>

<p>I feel like though that this is exactly what an encoder does and am trying to figure out if I can leverage it to do this frame generation work for me by handing it a list of Iframes with timestamps . </p>

But there doesn't seem to be a way to insert a frame at a target position .</p>
","<p>There are three options here.  One is to use a variable framerate format that can play back each frame for different lengths of time, however this would result in each frame jumping from one to the next which might not keep the illusion of motion if the frame rate is too low.  This would also be the smallest file size, but I'm not aware of any easily available encoders that would let you specify the length each frame is exposed.  (Granted, I haven't looked seriously for one.)</p>

<p>The second option is to simply place each frame on a timeline at the appropriate time in an editor and leave it up until the next frame is reached.  This can then use a traditional encoder, however it still requires a fair bit of manual work to layout the frames and results in a larger file than the first option.</p>

<p>The final option is to use interpolation software to interpolate objects out of the frame and generate between frames to smooth the motion.  This is by far the most complicated, but would also produce the smoothest results if done well.  If the gap is too wide, you will probably need to manually define objects in the scene with advanced interpolation software and have it generate the in between frames.  </p>

<p>Note that, as Jim Mack said, this is NOT something an encoder does.  An encoder only encodes the frames it is given, it makes no attempt to interpolate.  The closest to interpolation that an encoder might come is adjusting framerate on the fly (typically using a fixed conversion) or applying a de-interlace filter, but they do not offer a complex or particularly high quality interpolation solution.  Certainly not enough to handle what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Is it a plugin I have to import?<br>
Thanks for your time.</p>
","<p>The displacement map effect relies on another layer as a source for the map. Since Premiere doesn't have unique layers like AE does it doesn't support this plugin. If you have After Effects then replace the shot with an after effects comp (right-click then choose Replace With After Effects Composition) and apply the effect in AE.</p>

"Which different EDL types exist?","503","","<p>Edit decision lists are integrated in every pipeline nowadays. I've seen different types of it, but <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_decision_list"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a> only knows CMX 3600 EDL and a xml modification. </p>

<p>Which other formats exist and what are the differences of it? Is there a standard type which supported by all editing systems? Which open type has most features?</p>
","<p>CMX 3600 (or earlier 340) is very common and understood by many systems. GVG (Grass Valley Group) format is almost as common. For simple cuts, dissolves and keys the two are highly compatible, but for more complex edits, including speed changes, there are significant differences. Neither deals well with multiple layers or multiple sources in one event.</p>

<p>Many other companies use proprietary formats that are often only slightly different from basic CMX/GVG. Things like the size and contents of the source ID, the use of notes for special effects, and so on, may change from version to version as well.</p>

<p>To list the specifications would take a very long post. If you have specific questions about what each can handle, try asking here. But in general, for interchange you'll probably find XML-based EDLs to be most flexible, and CMX/GVG will be understood by the most different systems, within their limitations.</p>

","<p>To make your vector artwork into a playable movie file, it will have to be rendered, and another term for rendering is rasterizing.  For example, in printing, a single image is rasterized when a vector image of a page is converted to the tiny dots the printer produces on the page. </p>

<p>Digital movies exist in pixel-based raster formats, so each frame of the vector animation must be converted into a pixel-based representation of that frame, for each frame in the movie. Most software today uses the word render. Rendering will also apply some form of video compression to the resulting movie file, you'll want to experiment with different <em>codecs</em> to see what kind of render quality they offer.</p>

<p>You are trying to identify a 'workflow', a path you can take to make your project, that uses open source software.  The programs that have been brought up are very good, and could be the tools for the whole workflow, for many projects. You may also need some kind of video editing software. I'm not sure if there's a good open source video editor, or if Blender allows you to edit. </p>

<p>You should proceed by figuring out your production workflow, and looking for tools that can fulfill that workflow. </p>

"Color correction workflow","500","","<p>I completed my first short film in December. One of the most time consuming aspects of the project was making the colors look nice. I used Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5 and the free Magic Bullet plugin. I learned a lot. I now realise that color correction and grading is more of an art than an established set of rules.</p>

<p><strong>Could an expereinced colorist provide some practical tips about dealing with color correction and grading over the scope of the entire project.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Should I wait until I have a rough cut until I start correcting?</li>
<li>Should I correct individual clips on the timeline, or correct the original source?</li>
<li>Should correction (of exposure etc.) and grading (achieving a ""look"") be done at separate stages?</li>
<li>What kind of automated colour correction tools are there?</li>
<li>Are there things I can do during production that would help with the color correction (i.e. using a target with color squares printed on it <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000ALKEJ"">like this</a>)?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I am not an experienced colorist but I believe I can provide you with some answers. At least from an indie filmmaker's point of view.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wait until you have the final cut (or lock-off cut) before you grade. Grading usually happens at the same time as the sound design as both require a locked-off cut. It is best to wait until this stage so that you don't have to go back and grade new shots if the director decides he/she wants to make a change.</p></li>
<li><p>Correct individual clips on the timeline. You said you grade in Premiere using a plugin. That's cool. But there are other options. I always went from Final Cut to Apple Color but have recently discovered <a href=""http://www.blackmagic-design.com/"">DaVinci Resolve</a>. The Lite version is free. <a href=""http://www.taoofcolor.com/1066/davinci-resolve-8-1-1-lite-not/"">Here</a> is a bit of info on it.
Grading clip by clip is the best way to go because you can see what the clip before looked like and so you know what the next one needs to look like, i.e. it's easier to reference. 
You don't want to color grade the original video incase you decide you want to change something later. I believe doing something like that is called destructive editing. You want to keep it raw so that you can always come back to it. </p></li>
<li><p>In my experience, no, it happens at the same time. </p></li>
<li><p>Not too sure about this one. Avid Media Composer has pretty good color grading capabilities, I never use the auto correct on it, but it's there if you need it. Check out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIb8QtZ0FfU"">this</a> tutorial on grading in Avid. Other editing programs may have similar features, but I personally don't use them. And if you're editing a film, I don't see why you would want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes there are things you can do to help with grading in post. That color chart you linked to wouldn't really help you. I think that's more for when people shoot on film. They shoot 10 seconds or so of color chart on every new reel of film to make sure that the people who are processing their film are consistent. So, they have the same color chart and the same film. Provided they shoot it with the same lighting and exposure, the color charts should all look exactly the same when they come back from processing and telecine. If they don't the film processing company can get into trouble. 
During production you pretty much want to make sure you get the flattest image possible and correct exposure. If you under or overexpose a part of the scene, there is no detail recorded and there is no way to get it back. If you shoot on Canon DSLR there is a great (free) picture profile which helps to obtain a flat image optimized for color grading. It's called <a href=""http://www.technicolor.com/en/hi/cinema/filmmaking/digital-printer-lights/cinestyle"">CineStyle</a> by Technicolor. Otherwise you can shoot with the neutral picture profile with the contrast turned all the way down. 
I only have experience with Canon DSLRs so if you are using something else you would need to do some research on how to achieve a flat image. </p></li>

"Can an expression parse a text file or the expression of another property in After Effects?","496","","<p>I am going to have tons of layers use the same expression, but I need to be able to edit the expression later without having to edit it for every layer.

Or, if somehow I could put the expression on a null object and have each layer parse that expression for itself.
Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>My workaround solution is to make a null object with a slider control for every single value that I may edit later, updating all layers, but this doesn't allow me to change the non-numerical information in the expression, such as adding parenthesis or other functions.</p>
","<p>You can't put the expression on a null object, but you can use a text layer.</p>

<p>Following @bobtiki's <code>eval()</code> tip I tried using the source text of a text layer and running <code>eval()</code> on it. Initially I had no success, I was getting an <strong>""object of type TextProperty found where a Number, Array or Property is needed""</strong> error. But if I put something like a number on its own in the text layer and treated the source text like an array I <em>could</em> get it, I just wasn't able to access a whole string.</p>

<p>I was about to give up, then I remembered from doing extendscript scripting that you get the raw value of an AE property object using the javascript property <code>.value</code>*.</p>

<p>So after a bit of fiddling around with quotes and escaping (neither are needed, thank heavens) I got it to work. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Here is how you reference an expression that is written in a text layer's source</strong>, without having to save external files:</p>

<pre><code>var theExpression = thisComp.layer(""your text layer"").text.sourceText.value;
eval(theExpression);
</code></pre>

<p>And then you write the expression into the text layer, in this case called ""your text layer"". This is really cool! It even updates in real time <strong>as you're typing the expression</strong>!</p>

<p>Here's a comp with the position of the cyan layers being driven by the expression you see on the text layer. If I duplicate one of the cyan layers its position is calculated individually based on the random seed <code>index</code>, and if I change the expression, they all update!</p>

I'm stoked, this was the best question ever!</p>

<p>* <em>this sentence sounds like gibberish I know. The problem is that AE layers' property's values are JavaScript objects, and as such they have JavaScript properties, and one of the AE property's value's JavaScript properties is the <code>value</code> property which represents the raw value of the AE property. And the value of the AE source text property is an object which must include formatting and whatnot, and so it is different to the text.sourceText.value value. Confused?</em></p>

"How to extract frames and saving frame type to filenames with ffmpeg?","492","","<p>I have a research project where I need to apply very, very computationally heavy image filters on a h264 video. Due some restrictions outside my control I have to use proprietary filter that works only on images and not video. Filter has two modes, A mode is very computationally heavy but produces production ready quality and B mode is fast but produces less than stellar quality.</p>

<p>My theory is that given how h264 uses I-frames to get the reference and rest of the frames are ""non-essential"", if I can find apply the high quality A mode on I-frames and B mode on other frames, I should be able to leverage h264's own compression to get the result without having to use filter on A mode to every frame. Another avenue would be to try with h265 because it's more robust frame prediction capabilities.</p>

<p>What I've figured out so far is that I need to find a way to extract all frames from a video while knowing which ones are I-frames, then do a filter on all the frames, and then re-encode the video back together with minimum quality loss.</p>

<p><strong>So first question is that how can I extract frames with ffmpeg so that it somehow identifies each frame type on the filename?</strong></p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i C:\test.mp4 -vf select='eq(pict_type\,I)',setpts='N/(25*TB)' C:\testTemp\%09d.jpg

<p>Above gives you i-frames but I haven't figured out how I can get this to export all the frames and to put the type on the filename?</p>

<p><strong>Second question is that how can I re-encode the video so that it keeps the I-frame positions?</strong></p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i frame-%03d.png output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Above would make the video out of frames but the I-frame positioning eludes me.</p>

<p>I know this is a complex problem so all help is truly appreciated!</p>
","<p>Can't comment on the soundness of your theory, but here's a way to do it. Not directly, but in a roundabout way.</p>

<p>FFmpeg's segment muxer can break up a file at GOP boundaries, so running the command below generates a set of videos which each start with a keyframe but contain no other keyframes.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -c copy -f segment -segment_time 0.001 -segment_list list.ffcat -reset_timestamps 1 segs%d.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>This will create</p>

<pre><code>segs0.mp4
segs1.mp4
...
segs101.mp4
..etc
</code></pre>

<p>Extract each segment to images</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i segN.mp4 outN-%d.png
</code></pre>

<p>Apply A on first frame of each image series and B on the rest.</p>

<p>Then for each processed series, run</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -framerate X -i procN-%d.png -c:v libx264 -keyint_min 1000 -x264opts stitchable ""result\segsN.mp4""
</code></pre>

<p><code>-keyint_min</code> value should be greater than no. of frames in each series.</p>

<p>Hopefully the names of the resulting MP4s are the same as the original split segments, which makes the next step more convenient.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out what the best methodology is for planning and executing this. This is what I currently do but it feels very clunky to say the least:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record Audio Track</li>
<li>Make animation in Flash with no Audio</li>
<li>Bring into compositing software (I use Premier CC2015) and do my best to trim and move tracks around. At times adding still frames to extend parts of the animation.</li>
<li>If I have to then I go back into Flash to make more animation to fill empty areas. I try not to have to redo the audio as much since its much more time consuming and would then have to start the entire syncing process over as well since talking isn't as easy as controlling a timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's got to be a better way to do this though, I'm just not sure what it is.</p>

<p>Should I just do the entire video and then play it while I record the voiceover? That would work for parts where the audio is short and the animation long. But is more difficult on parts where the audio is long and the animation is short.</p>
","<p>In addition to @Mulvya answer I will suggest to use not Flash, but After Effects for animation, if possible. Then you will be able to make <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/how-to/integration-after-effects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Dynamic Link</a> to your AE project. Than will be easier to jump between applications.</p>

<p>But when you work with animation, you deferentially need to have voiceover first. Like in cartoon development.</p>

"What equipment do I need to be able to produce 'HD quality' videos?","483","","<p>For starters, please forgive me if this question is very amateurish - if they sound that way, that's because I am an amateur.</p>

<p>I would like to start shooting some webisodes in my garage and want to know what equipment I will need.</p>

<p>The quality would be the equivalent to that of any of Revision3's shows - or more specifically <a href=""http://www.totallyradshow.com"">TRS</a>. So nothing TOO high quality, but decent-ish quality.</p>

<p>I have a Canon 7D, and would like another camera for a 2nd shot. My budget is about $4Kish for everything. The 2nd camera, lighting, audio, etc.</p>

<p>Someone suggested a t3i, or t4i for my second camera - what do you guys think about that?</p>

<p>Also, about 60% of the shots I do will be in this garage, but I also want to be mobile and be able to setup shots elsewhere - so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Can you recommend lighting (both individual pieces and entire kits) and audio solutions that I might want to look at?</p>

<p>I was thinking of getting stuff on B&amp;H, but the choices just seem overwhelming and I know it's easy to spend a ton of money on stuff that I don't ""need"".</p>

<p>So I would love any feedback on how I can get a ""decent-ish"" studio setup for a few $K.</p>
","<p>With your budget, I would suggest investing in a few basic lights and decent audio recording equipment. </p>

<p>While a second camera is nice to have, creating production value with the non-picture parts of your films will make them a lot better. If you need to get second or third angle, just move the camera for a closeup and re-run the scene. Sure, it may take longer to shoot, but from my experience, you'll have better selection in the edit suite than if you're just cutting a bunch of suimultaneously rolling cameras together. </p>

<p>There's also the issue of matching. The 7D is so spectacular, that I'd fear mixing in something that's not comparable (and likely over your budget) will be very visible to the viewer. </p>

<p>Lighting: Learn basic three point lighting. Rather than buying a kit new, check eBay for Lowel lights. They're relatively well made (using metal!) and still very economical. The ProLight, VLight and Rifa lights are good to start a digital video lighting package with. I've put together kits designed to my specs buying individual pieces off of eBay, and spent half the cost of a comparable kit new. I would say a good place to start is 2-3 ProLights and a Rifa Light, <em>maybe</em> a vLight. The latter is good for just makign something bright, but isn't terribly good at adding modeling to a scene. It may not be appropriate for your garage shoot. I usually use it to uplight a tree in night shots jsut to add some texture.</p>

<p>Accessories for lighting: stands, dimmer switches and a roll of blackwrap. Gels are useful once you start shooting outside...you'll need to balance the lights to match the sun. Read about Color Balance and Color temperature if you're unfamiliar with the concept. </p>

<p>Audio: Invest in a good shotgun mic and a boom pole. I <strong>cannot</strong> stress enough the importance of good audio. If your picture is mediocre, awesome sound can save it, but no matter how awesome your picture is, bad sound makes it unwatchable. Play around with the mic to learn how its pickup pattern works and to find the sweet spot for placement. If you need to record sounds effects, ambient sounds, or record dual system, pick of an H4N. It's one of the best investments I made into my audio kit, and I use it on <strong>every</strong> shoot.</p>

<p>A solid, economical mic is the Audio Technica AT-435B. Sennheiser is also a good brand, but more expensive. I forget my model numbers off the top of my head; perhaps someone can fill in? </p>

<p>In short, a second camera is not as necessary as lighting and audio. The production value that you can add with those things far outweighs the convenience of adding a second camera. If you <strong>do</strong> insist on a second camera, look at the GoPro. I work on a lot of network shows that just place one of these to get b-roll...for cooking shows, it'll just monitor the cooktop while the rest of the crew runs around the restaurant. Quality is good enough to cut ionto broadcast shows, but the size of the chip limits its contrast and color reproduction...so there is a marked quality difference between that and the 7D. That being said, perhaps killer audio and lighting will compensate. Good luck! </p>

"In what aspect ratio shoud one record with a DSLR?","481","","<p>This Question is not about what aspect ratio should be chosen for the final film, it's rather about how to get the biggest ""resolution"" capable of the cammera.</p>

<p>When you take a photo with a Modern camera ""usually"" it's 4/3, I know you can change the aspect ratio, but that's not my point.
I assume, that the sensors of DSLR cameras are the same ratio, because they are created for the purpose of creating photos, aren't they?</p>

<p>I guess focal lenght can be taken in account as well.</p>

<p>Now when you shoot Video in 16:9, I assume, that the image is ""croped"", because you can't change the size and ratio of your sensor.</p>

<p>So the only way, to have that aspect ratio, is to leave it blank or record on the top/bottom of the image (or both) a black bar.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be smarter, to record with the fullsensor, to get ""more"" of the image""?</p>

<p>This might sound redicolous, because you'd have a bigge file size and have to put black bars over it in post. But like this you'd have some extra ""room"", for example someone dips the Microphone or the boom in the picture, you could just crop the clip a bit further down and still be able to use it.</p>

<p>More footage = better to edit, right?</p>

<p>Because you still have the same width of the sensor that you use, you just use all of the avaivable height as well.</p>

<p>Now here is my question:
What aspect ratio, should you put your cammera into, to get the highest resolution. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>When you take a photo with a Modern camera ""usually"" it's 4/3, I know you can change the aspect ratio, but that's not my point. I assume, that the sensors of DSLR cameras are the same ratio, because they are created for the purpose of creating photos, aren't they?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, no. Only low-end digital cameras (mostly point-and-shoot) use a 4/3 aspect ratio, because they were designed to match the aspect ratio of computer displays (which used to be 4/3). DSLRs use the traditional 3/2 aspect ratio of 35mm film. So if you set your DSLR to 4/3 (for photos), a part of the sides gets cropped.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wouldn't it be smarter, to record with the fullsensor, to get ""more"" of the image""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most DSLRs don't use their 'full' resolution for video because of technical limitations (mostly memory buffer, but also memory card transfer speed). For example: My Canon EOS 80D has a maximum resolution of 6000x4000 pixels for photos. However, the highest video resolution it can record in is 1920x1080p @ 50fps (IPB). IPB means every frame is recorded as a full frame, no interframe compression is applied. Recording 25 or even 50 frames per second at a resolution of 6000x4000 pixels would result in an absurdly high data rate that DLSRs simply aren't built to process and transfer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What aspect ratio, should you put your cammera into, to get the highest resolution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on your camera. Either the camera menu or manual will specify the available resolutions for each aspect ratio, possibly it's a seperate setting as well. This way you can tell what combination gives you the highest resolution. If you can't find the resolution specified in the menu or the manual, take a test recording with every setting the camera has, copy the files to your computer and check each file's resolution with <a href=""https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MediaInfo</a> or a similar program.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that apart from the resolution, the bitrate will have a much higher impact on your video quality than some pixels more or less. Make sure to get a fast SD card with a lot of space so you can always record at the highest bitrate (and I-frames only if that's an option with your camera). Also, it's good practice to film in the resolution that you want your final video to be in for more reasons than video quality. So if you're creating a video that is intended to be viewed on normal video screens, film in 16/9 from the start.</p>

"Video editing objects from black and white to colour","478","","<p>For school we came up with a cool concept, the video starts in black and white and when a person in the video touches an object it turns to colour.</p>

<p>Could you guys help us out here? Do you have any tutorials for us? Which programs do we have to use (the price of the software is not a problem).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>PS.</p>

<p>I now understand that rotoscoping can be used for this. But how bout a gradual change from black and white to colour if a building has been touched for example? For it to change in one frame will look kinda terrible...</p>
","<p>This will probably require a technique called rotoscoping, which involves painting a mask on each frame.  You would need to have two layers of video, one which is desaturated (to make the image black and white) and one which is full color.  You would then need to make a mask (a layer which effectively makes a hole in the black and white layer so that the color layer can be seen).  Since the mask may change based on camera movement and actors moving around the scene, you have to update the mask periodically (possibly every frame).</p>

<p>You can simplify the process quite a bit if the objects are stationary in the scene and the camera is stationary on a tripod.  You could also try using object tracking to maintain the placement of the mask roughly, but to get a satisfactory result, you will probably still need some rotoscoping.</p>

<p>After Effects can accomplish what you are looking for.  Any tutorials on rotoscoping and masking in AE would work to demonstrate the finer points of what tools to use to accomplish it.</p>

<p>When I get a new rig with a more capable CPU (Skylake or later, I hear), is it possible for me, to ""re-compress"" my HEVC videos using eg. <code>--preset veryslow</code>, without quality loss due to encoding a second time?</p>

<li>Place the camera on a tripod.</li>
<li>Use a greenscreen to better separate the subject from the background.</li>

","<p>I'm not sure you need a better camera for this. since you are downgrading the images to a pretty low quality anyway. The secret to good green screen photography is in the lighting more than in the camera. You need to light the background as evenly as possible, and use a background color that is not present in the subject's clothing. In your example blue would not work due to the shirt, but green might. You can also use a white sheet if you make sure no part of your subject gets blown specular highlights. You need to make sure your subject is not too close to the background, as it may catch reflected light from it. This is particularly important if you go with blue or green background, maybe less with white.</p>

<p>The camera on a tripod is a good idea, but don't expect you'll get images that will be perfectly registered. I expect you will still need to align them, but the job will be easier when the camera was fixed on a tripod.</p>

<p>The camera should be in manual. If you don't want to mess much with the settings just take a few test pictures in auto mode (no on-camera flash, try to use other light sources from the sides, to not create shadows on the background) and once you find one that you like switch to manual and copy the exposure settings.</p>

<p>I think you want to mark a spot on the floor that your subject can use to position himself for the pictures. A line does not seem too useful, since your friend isn't really walking.</p>

<p>My final advice (the one that might be off-topic for this site) is that you grab a good book on animation and learn the animated walk cycle. You just need to have your friend pose in those proven positions that make up natural walks in cartoons. My recommendation is the Preston Blair book, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1560100842"" rel=""nofollow"">Cartoon Animation</a>.</p>

<p>Here's an example expression I wrote based on the blog posts above -</p>

<pre><code>threshold = 0.01;  // this is the threshold below which the track becomes transparent - black = 0.
driverLayer = thisComp.layer(""Pre-comp 1"");
samplePoint = [0,0]; // examine from the top left pixel
sampleSize = [640,360]; // examine the full comp size (in this case 640x360)
lightnessSample = driverLayer.sampleImage(samplePoint,sampleSize);  // this samples the image as rgb
driverLightness = rgbToHsl(lightnessSample)[2]; // converts to hue, saturation and lightness, then only takes lightness
if (driverLightness &gt;=threshold) transform.opacity = 100 else 0; // tell opacity to be either 100 or zero depending upon the threshold point chosen in line 1
</code></pre>

<p>I applied this to the opacity layer.  You would need to adjust the threshold value, and the size of your comp ( in my case 640x360). (the red solid below was to see whether the opacity change was working.  I guess you would put a copy of your video showing the previous frame here?

","<p>Regardless of format; 16, 35, 65, etc... The studios would distrubute release prints. The prints were shipped (speaking about 35mm here) on 2000' reels; 5 reels to a can. </p>

<p>In the olden day's they would use two projectors and the projectionist would have to literally load reel one, and two to the other, and they would switch over. Back and forth. A typical movie in today's world (2 hours) would run about 5 reels. </p>

<p>So let's talk the 1990s. The theater receives a can of 5 reels. The reels would be sent up to the projectionist booth. The projectionist would then assemble the reels into one giant reel; on a platter; basically a large spinning lazy-susan. The platter can feed either from the inside; called the core (the core is roughly 10 inches; and has a center mechanism so with rollers in an assembly so the film never has to be ""rewound"". </p>

<p>The projectionist would first add blank leader, just black, typically 30 seconds; then they would use a film splicer and film tape to add the theater opening title, and each trailer which would play before the film. Some films; shipped with specific trailers on them. But most times; there would be racks and racks of trailers (small film reels about 6 inches (3 minutes) of film; and the projectionist would; whatever his preference or theater policy; add the trailers he wanted (typically matching action with action films, etc). Then any other small film reels would be added; ""Turn off your cell phones"". Etc. </p>

<p>Lastly; the projectionist would add reel 1, then 2, and so on; and the platter is motorized so it literally pulls the film off the reel which is setup on a rolling stand. </p>

<p>Each reel would need to be checked at the tails; and spliced and glued together. </p>

<p>The final reel would be a very large reel of film; roughly 5 feet in diameter, with a core about 10 inches in the middle. </p>

<p>Because this would be the ""first run"", the start of the movie would be on the inside, in the core; so the film would be pulled out of the core; through multiple rollers; and into the projector; and then fed to a take up platter either below or above the feed platter. (Typically there would be 3 platters so you could have more than one movie available on any given screen). </p>

<p>This setup would yield after the movie with the film left on a new platter, ready to be ""re-threaded"" through the projector.  Every showing required the projectionist to check the platter; and reload the projector threading the film over rollers with sprockets; through the gate, and then to the take up reel. </p>

<p>Release Prints were VERY expensive for the studios to produce. So many theaters had rollers for ""Big Releases"" - think ""Titanic""; where one platter would run through the projector, then instead of going straight to a take up platter; it would be fed through a series of rollers down a long wall; to a 2nd or even 3rd projector; and they would have 3 screens starting all at the same time. The final take up reel would be at the last projector. </p>

<p>After the film was finished being run. The projectionist would then literally do the opposite of putting it together. Trailers typically discarded; and the film put back onto the 2000' reels. The film reels would be put back into the can; labeled for FedEx, and sent to a B-Theater; a less popular/lower income movie house. </p>

<p>This is why when you saw movies in the pre-2000s at say an old mall movie theater; there would be lots of scratches and dust, because the film had been played so many times and had been out for so long. </p>

<p>Now; you can find release prints on ebay; I almost bought a ""Terminator 2"" release print just to have... they were owned by the studio, and destroyed after use... so they are fairly scarce. </p>

<p>The projectionist would have to pay close attention during assembly and tear down; because you cannot rewind the platter. </p>

<p>I speak from being a projectionist for a year after highschool. One time I assembled a movie in the order of reel 1, 2, 4, 3, 5. So half way through the movie people got confused and came out and complained. With no way to rewind or fixed, the rest of the days shows had to be canceled, and the film reels taken back apart and put back into the same order. </p>

<p>Last note; you can typically see the change from reel to reel when watching a movie; either by seeing what's called a cigarette burn (small circle top right of frame), or simply, you notice a weird cut/shift in color/sound where the splice was... Because the release prints were made on multiple printers, color always didn't match reel to reel. Most times, you could at the least (if the film had an optical audio track); a small pop. Towards the later 90s... films went to digital DTS, and THX went digital as well. But before that, the film was a waveform optically printed on the left side of the frame. The audio, was optical. </p>

<p>In terms of how they did it ""effectively"". It's just how it was done for almost a 100 years. They were very very happy when things went digital. And theaters had to literally fight the studios, because most projectors in film houses were decades old... mechanical... and the studios wanted them all to upgrade to 20K Lumen 4K Dual Projectors (Digital); which run about $200,000 each. </p>

"Why filmmaking with DSLR?","469","","<p>Adding video feature to digital camera was for their popular applications, as unprofessional users wanted to have both photography and videography at the same time. Professional cameras were exclusively divided to photography or videography. However, this situation is changing, and videography features are added to DSLR cameras too.</p>

<p>The interesting point is that the level professionality of videography on photography cameras are reaching the highest level, as many filmmakers use DSLR camera for professional projects. I understand that technology is advancing with better DSLR cameras, but video cameras were also advanced. Why there is such tendency to use photography camera for filmmaking?</p>

<p>What are the technical advantages (or even better pros and cons) of using photography DSLR camera for filmmaking?</p>
","<p>The main advantage is cost.  Historically, there were two main types of imaging sensors, CMOS and CCD.  CMOS was historically used in digital cameras (because of the higher quality images it can capture, the lower cost, and the fact that digital cameras only have to capture a single moment).  </p>

<p>CCDs on the other hand were historically used in video cameras, with one CCD per color (3CCD) to increase the quality.  They have been significantly more expensive and generally capable of lower resolutions, but had the advantage of capturing the entire frame at the same time.</p>

<p>Most CMOS sensors scan line by line rather than capturing a fixed image at a time, they exhibit an artifact known as a rolling shutter.  This appears as a distortion when the camera is moving (particularly panning) due to the change of orientation mid-frame.  Previously, the sample rates for CMOS sensors were too slow to allow their use for video, but as the technology has improved, it is now possible to sample quickly enough that, while still present, rolling shutter is not nearly the problem it was even a few years ago.  Now there are even CMOS sensors capable of offering a global shutter and they have all but supplanted the old CCD based cameras, with even major motion pictures being shot on CMOS sensors with global shutters.</p>

<p>The advances in CMOS technology have allowed for CMOS sensors to be used in professional level video, bringing with them the low cost, high resolution and high quality that had previously not been possible.  Global shutter CMOS still costs more than rolling shutter relative to other features of the sensor, so rolling shutter is still present in many cameras (even fairly high end cinema cameras) due to the cost savings and the fact that higher sampling speed has greatly reduced the impact of rolling shutters.</p>

<p>Another large advantage is size.  DSLRs tend to have less processing capability to work with the large amounts of data involved in things like 4k video, so they are more limited in capability, but they also are much smaller and more portable.  This is probably most visible in comparing the Black Magic Production Camera and the Black Magic Ursa Mini 4k.  Both use the same 4k sensor, however the size of the BMPC limits it's ability to work with high frame rate video as well as some other features of the camera.  The Ursa Mini is a much larger form factor that currently costs the exact same amount, but is able to fit more features in due to the extra size and hardware that can be included in the larger form factor.</p>

"Control key frame value with slider control","468","","<p>I have an object in After Effects comp and I need its scale to change from <em>keyframe A</em> to <em>keyframe B</em> and I need <em>keyframe A</em> to have value of 95% and <em>keyframe B</em> value of whatever is set via slider control. Now I know how to set overall scale by slider, but I seem to have problem finding a way to link just that one keyframe to my slider control.</p>

<p>I am fairly new to expressions and I tried to re-purpose following one I found for the same thing but with opacity, but it doesn't work. I think it's because it supplies just one value and scale needs two values, but I honestly have very little idea whats going on in the expression and how to adapt it.</p>

  t1 = key(1).time;
  t2 = key(2).time;
  v1 = 0;
  v2 = comp(""INPUT"").layer(""CONTROL"").effect(""Zoom intensity"")(""Slider"");
  linear(time,t1,t2,v1,v2);
}else
  value
</code></pre>
","<p>You were close.</p>

<pre><code>if (numKeys &gt; 1){
  t1 = key(1).time;
  t2 = key(2).time;
  v1 = [95, 95]; //or if it's 3d [95, 95, 95]
  slider = comp(""INPUT"").layer(""CONTROL"").effect(""Zoom intensity"")(""Slider"");
  v2 = [slider, slider]; // or [slider,slider,slider] if 3D
  linear((time, t1, t2, v1, v2);
} else {
  value
}
</code></pre>

<p>You were right that the scale property requires 2 (or 3) dimensions. So you need to use arrays, which look like <code>[value1, value2]</code>, or <code>[value1, value2, value3,… valueN]</code> for as many members you want the array to have.</p>

<ul>
<li>On line 4 I assume you want it to be <code>95%</code> not <code>0</code>. I also changed it to an array.</li>
<li>on line 5 I assign the slider value to a temporary variable and then put that in an array. You could do it in one line by repeating the <code>comp(""INPUT"" … (Slider)</code> phrase inside an array, but it would be really long and awkward. Alternatively you could use a point control if you wanted to be able to set the dimensions separately.</li>
<li>on line 8 the <code>else</code> without curly braces works, but it makes me nervous.</li>

"Traditional animation techniques and 30fps software animation?","466","","<p>I'm putting together a very basic software to animate a few pixels frame-by-frame. I've skimmed through Richard William's Animator's Survival Kit in the past and noticed most traditional animation uses 24fps and he used to ""animate on twos"" for most motion and on ""ones"" for fast motion. </p>

<p>Since my tool will deal with frame by frame animation I'd like to make use of those principles, but I am constraint to 30 fps. Because of this, I'm wondering how would I workout at what frame interval(every frame, every two frames, every three frames, etc.) a 'keyframe'/changed frame should be placed to look good ? Is there a way to work that out arithmetically ? Does it make a bit difference/ is it safe two stick to twos even for 30fps ?</p>
","<p>Yes, repeating every other frame works the same way at 30fps as it does at 24fps.</p>

<p>Animating on twos is done not because it looks better, but because it means less drawing and you can 'get away' with it. Nothing stops you from drawing every frame if you want the smoothest possible motion, and nothing prevents you from repeating a frame indefinitely when there is no motion.</p>

<p>If you really want to work at 24fps, you could always animate 'as though' you were working at 24fps -- your work will look sped up when viewed at 30fps -- and applying a cine expansion (3:2 pulldown) as a final step.</p>

<li>Encoding speed vs. compression density: <code>-preset veryslow</code>.

If you want quicker encoding, use <code>ultrafast</code>, <code>fast</code>, <code>medium</code> or <code>slow</code>.</li>
<li>Video quality: <code>-crf 23</code>. Quite good quality. Decreasing this number will increase quality but also logarithmically increase file size. This setting strikes an okay balance between file size and quality. <code>18</code> is visually lossless but takes up much space.</li>

<h2>CC licences and unauthorized distribution</h2>

<p>Creative Commons are a set of licences that allow creators to distribute their original content (e.g. music) using liberal licences under easy to understand terms. However, in order to do so, the uploader needs to hold the rights to the music (usually this means they are the creator). If they don't, they have no right to grant any permissions regarding the use of that music. It's your responsibility to check if they do have those rights. </p>

<p>Excerpt from <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/19952/where-to-get-good-music-for-corporate-videos/19964#19964"">my answer here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that just because someone uploads music to a website and claims it's free-to-use, it doesn't mean he actually has the right to do so or the authority to grant you any rights to it. And if you use a copyrighted piece of music in your project without knowing any better, you can stil be held responsible even if you downloaded it from a website that claimed it was free. Always check if the website you are downloading from is legit and if the uploaders actually have to rights to the music (in most cases, that means they made it themselves). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, just because someone uploads a Hannah Montana album to some website and puts a CC icon next to it, you still can't use Best of Both Worlds in your video. And if you do, you can't rely on your claim that you got it from that site, because the uploader didn't hold the rights to that music in the first place and it would've been your responsibility to check if they do. </p>

<p>If it's music from a rather unknown author and there were no signs that the original source isn't legit, you might not be held responsible for the 'damage' (claimed by the copyright holder, whether that damage actually exists is a rather philosophical question) caused by your usage of the music. However, even in that case, you'd have to take your video down. So there's no winning in a situation like that.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Always make sure that uploader of whatever music you want to use actually made that music.</p>

<p>In your case, the Soundcloud account looks to be legit, so let's proceed. </p>

<h2>CC licenses and retractability</h2>

<p>This is only tangetially related to your specific problem, but it's actually something that I think is quite relevant to false copyright claims regarding CC licenced work. All CC licences contain this condition: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.</p>

<p>What this means is as long as you uphold the terms of the licence, the uploader can't retract the permissions granted by the CC licence. Of course that doesn't mean he has to continue distribution his works indefinetely. But if a music creator at some point decides to stop distributing his work under a CC licence, this doesn't affect any work using his music (e.g. your YouTube video) that was created before that time. </p>

<p>So, assuming you made sure the uploader of the music holds the right to it and follow the licence terms (e.g. proper attribution), your video doesn't infringe any copyright and you are right to dispute such a claim. </p>

<p>(Note: If an artist at some point stops distributing his music under a CC licence, from that point onwards you can't rightfully publish any <em>new</em> work using his music, even if you downloaded it while it was still CC licenced. The non-retractibility only affects works published while the music was being distributed under a CC licence.)</p>

<p>However, being right isn't all there is to it. There's a saying in German:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recht haben und Recht bekommen sind zwei Paar Schuhe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roughly translated: Being right and being proven right are two different things. That's where YouTube's ID system and false copyright claims come into play.</p>

<h2>YouTube's ID system</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In the beginning the YouTube ID system was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>YouTube has a system in place that automatically checks for copyrighted music in uploaded videos and places copyright claims accordingly. The copyright holder of that music (according to YouTube's database) then gets notified and can decide what to do with it; for example, they can have the video taken down, or they can decide to leave it up but receive a portion of this video's ad proceeds. They can also decide on a default action, and that's a big part of the problem that made many people very angry.</p>

<p>In 2013 especially there was much trouble regarding this system. The problem was, the automated ID system was terrible to begin with and would often attribute music wrongly. There were also many scammers that would claim copyright for music that wasn't theirs. The problem is that in cases like this, YouTube favors the copyright holder. So instead of having the person who claims a copyright infringement provide them with proof, the video creator's have to dispute a claim and provide prove that they didn't infringe any copyrights. This usually took a couple of weeks and in the meantime, the person to claim the copyright infringement got all the proceeds from that video.</p>

<p>This system has since been <a href=""http://kotaku.com/youtubes-content-id-system-gets-one-much-needed-fix-1773643254"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">refined</a> and the uproar died down, but you still hear stories like yours occassionaly. When in doubt, YouTube still favors the copyright claimer over the video creator. </p>

<h2>The Orchard Group</h2>

<p>I hadn't heard of the Orchard Group before, but I've looked through the links you included in your question and did some additional research. As you already said, you are not the first creator to have problems with false copyright claims. On the forums, many people are quick to call them scam artists. But I'm not sure about that. There are also some stories about people that contacted them and got their false copyright claim resolved quickly. I believe the root of the problem might be this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Orchard's YouTube multi-channel network has more than 1,000 channels across the globe and uses technology, built in-house, called B.A.C.O.N. (Bulk Automated Claiming on The Orchard Network) to crawl, claim and track YouTube videos to monetize for their clients. It was ranked 7th in the U.S. in July 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orchard_(company)#cite_ref-47"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source: Wikipedia</a></sub></p>

<p>However, according to this source, the Orchard Music isn't unwilling to forfeit wrongly submitted copyright claims: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>YouTube users have expressed concerns about The Orchard claiming copyright ownership of music used in user-generated content that may or may not belong to them. According to an article by The Orchard on their Daily Rind blog, if audio is matched to a particular copyright owner via YouTube's content identification system, then one or more links will be placed under the video in order to help promote the copyright owner's music, with the video remaining available. The article states that erroneous claims are removed by The Orchard Team after review upon email communication with their dispute department.</p>
  
  <p>In this context, The Orchard has been criticized by YouTube users for claiming content that is not theirs or in some cases, content that did not exist within the video at all. In a blog post on The Daily Rind, The Orchard explains that this is due to YouTube's automated Content ID matching and outlines steps for resolving this scenario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you got two automated systems that can both screw up and have been shown to do so often. Not an ideal situation for content creators. If you get caught in such an automated system, the solution is almost always to contact the people responsible for it. Contact the Orchard Group and possibly also contact the original artist of the music. If they are indeed not trying to scam anyone, they will be willing to help you. If the Orchard Group doesn't reply, public shaming on Twitter oftentimes helps you get in touch with an actual person, not just with an email autoresponder.</p>

<p>If they actually <em>are</em> scammers or plainly refuse to forfeit their copyright claim, you will have to contact YouTube to get it resolved. So ...</p>

<h2>Your questions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>How is it possible that Orchard Music can claim ownership of a Creative Commons music production?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned, this is mostly done by automated systems that are prone to misfires, especially if larger distribution/collection companies are involved. Also, you can claim anything, that doesn't mean you actually have any lawful grounds on which your claim is based. I can claim that I be crowned High King of the Universe, but nobody will have to call me Your Majesty. And if I sue them, I'm unlikely to win that case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Why do I need a publishing license to a Creative Commons music production?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't. The CC licence gives you the right to publish your video if you follow the terms laid out in the licence, you don't need to pay any additional licence fees or royalties. However, a human error is also possible.</p>

<p>For example, maybe the artist is represented by the Orchard Group and never intended to publish their work under a CC licence. Maybe they just forgot to change that setting while uploading their music to Soundcloud. I'm not sure about Soundcloud, but if you for example upload something to Vimeo, a CC-BY licence is applied <em>by default</em>, and you have to go into a submenu of the settings to change that. I think that is a terrible implementation, but that's how it is. </p>

<p>Even if that case, you would probably be within your rights to invoke the licence terms the author published his music under, but it might not be feasible or realistic to do so and see your claim through. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Should I dispute the claim for the second time?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That is your decision. Before you do anything, check if you followed all the licence terms, the legitimacy of your music source and everything else mentioned in this post. It might also be better to contact the Orchard Group or the artist directly to see if you can't get the issue resolved without involving YouTube as a third party. Though a lawyer would probably tell you that contacting them is the worst thing to do if you plan to follow this up with a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Just remember, being right doesn't mean YouTube will take your side. And if they don't, there's little you can do besides suing, which might not be feasible for you.</p>

"Why does variable bitrate still have a bitrate specified?","457","","<p>My understanding is that the vorbis algorithm uses a variable rate of encoding.</p>

<p>So, when encoding videos with audio in vorbis format, why does Handbrake ask me for a bitrate? What does Handbrake do when I choose a bitrate of 160, say, in the audio section?</p>
","<p>You can see the bitrate in this case as a quality target. It will not encode the audio strictly at that bit-rate but try to encode the audio in a way that it will always be ""near"" your specified bit-rate.</p>

<p>Usually you can translate certain bit-rates to a specific quality level which can be compared to lames ""V0"", ""V2"" etc. VBR settings, these presets don't define a specific bit-rate but files encoded with these settings will always end up at certain ""bit-rate range"". The encoder will encode the audio around a specific bit-rate but will go higher or lower within a certain threshold.</p>

<p>It doesn't make all that much sense to have bit-rats present instead of the Vorbis quality targets but I assume handbrake does this because all other codecs it offers use bit-rates. Most users are used to bit-rates and can associate it to a rough quality level. Unlike Vorbis own ""q5"" or ""q9"" which you can only translate to a relative quality difference between the different levels (if you are not used to using this codec) but you wont know what you actually end up with.</p>

"Best way of presenting both 720p and 1080p screencasts","456","","<p>I record screencasts in 720p resolution, but would like to put up 1080p as well. This brings a problem: how can I record videos in 1080p such that they still look OK when scaled down to 720p? I've been thinking about DPI scaling (on Windows), but maybe it's possible to go the other way, i.e. record at 720p and then use some sort of smart scaling to produce a (relatively speaking) high-quality 1080p render?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking shooting in 1080p and scaling it down to 720p is not a problem with cameras as I do this all the time and it looks just fine. When I do this I may also be mixing 1080p and 720p raw images, and I always scale to the lowest resolution. When I render a 1080p I will generally render a 720p version as an answer print to view before committing the final cut to a 1080p render. I say this with caution because I have not worked with screencasts or using screen motion capture software.</p>

<p>However, shooting in 720p and trying to make it into 1080p is a losing battle because then you are asking software to make up for pixels that do not exist. You can try it, but I don't think you will like it unless someone makes a software product something like Twixtor that adds frames needed for extra slow motion shots.</p>

<p>Citation from <a href=""https://x265.readthedocs.io/en/default/presets.html#presets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the official source</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x265 has ten predefined --preset options that optimize the trade-off between encoding speed (encoded frames per second) and compression efficiency (quality per bit in the bitstream). The default preset is medium. It does a reasonably good job of finding the best possible quality without spending excessive CPU cycles looking for the absolute most efficient way to achieve that quality. When you use faster presets, the encoder takes shortcuts to improve performance at the expense of quality and compression efficiency. When you use slower presets, x265 tests more encoding options, using more computations to achieve the best quality at your selected bit rate (or in the case of –crf rate control, the lowest bit rate at the selected quality).  </p>

"Why do higher frame rates require lower resolution?","455","","<p>I've noticed that when comparing video camera specifications, higher frame rates usually require a lowered resolution.  For example, the GoPro Hero4 Silver can get 15fps at 4k, 60fps at 1080p, 120fps at 720p, and 240fps at vga.  I would think that the resolution of the individual frames would be independent of the rate of capture.  Is this because of bitrate capabilities of internal cables, or an encoding limit on the internal circuitry?  Thanks for your help.</p>
","<p>I am not an engineer, but I think you've answered your own question. </p>

<p>This is a bit of an oversimplification, but if <strong>t</strong> is the time it takes to record, process and store a pixel from a frame consisting of <strong>p</strong> pixels, then 1/(<strong>t</strong> * <strong>p</strong>) is your maximum frame rate. So if you increase the framerate above the maximum you need to decrease either <strong>t</strong> or <strong>p</strong>.

"What format should I digitize mini DV tapes with HDV footage in?","449","","<p>I want to digitize a lot of mini dv tape footage, shot on a Sony a1(HDV).  What format should I digitize the footage in? (and on a side note can you point me in the direction of what hardware I will need for this)?</p>
","<p>You have a few options for capturing Mini-DV tape.  The first and highest quality, but largest size, is to capture it in HDV format (HDV2 is used by most Sony cameras).  It is a form of MPEG-2 Part 2 video.  This is the same as the format actually stored on the tape.  Storing your files as HDV will preserve the quality of the recorded footage, but it will take quite a lot of space.  This is ideal for high quality archives and any footage that will be used as a source for editing.  It only requires a firewire port and DV capture software (which is also built in to most NLEs.)</p>

<p>If you only care about viewing, then your best option is probably to initially capture to HDV and then transcode to h.264.  h.264 is a high quality compression that you can tweak for the quality/size trade off you desire.  I'd personally recommend either a constant quality or a 2 pass VBR encoding for maximum quality to size.  This doesn't require any specialized hardware beyond the initial HDV capture and can be done entirely in software with free tools (which may even be able to leverage GPU acceleration depending on your video card.)</p>

"Best way to increase the display size of a web video","446","","<p>I have a H.264 (ex-MOV, ex-Flash) video of 550px x 250 px. In the HTML player (videojs), I can easily set its size to 640px x 290px and it still looks OK (only a 16.363636% increase in display size). </p>

<p>Or should I increase it's size in ""real pixels"" by exporting it as H.264 from, say, Avanti or Handbrake at a bigger size? In Avanti, under ""Frame size"" I specified 640 x 290 and the file size increased by 8% and data rate from 200 kbps to 215.</p>

<p>What are the trade-offs - would enlarging via HTML be stressful for low-end CPUs? Is the 8% increase in file size and kbps worth it for the extra quality, if any?</p>
","<p>If it is a flash source, then there is a good chance it has vector elements.  You should export at a higher resolution from the source rather than trying to upscale the mov file.  </p>

<p>Working from the original will ensure accurate pixel data for any vector elements and produce a much higher quality upscale.  (This is actually one of the major reasons for Flash's early popularity.)  If that isn't an option or it was a raster format asset in Flash, then it is really a toss up between the two options depending on the quality of the original encoding.</p>

<p>Encoding to a new size can do slower and more accurate upscaling that will produce fewer artifacts, but if the original source you are upscaling from is already pretty low quality, a second generation of encoding loss may very well exceed the amount of quality improvement you get from the rendered out upscale.</p>

<p>So in summary, the best option is to export from Flash at a higher resolution.  If you can't do that, re-encode if you can do it without another generation of loss or have a high enough quality source (200kbps is not high enough for a re-encode most likely).  Finally, if you don't have that, then stick with the re-size in the player on the fly.</p>

"Can video have multiple streams (like it has 2 audio streams)","446","","<p>Is that possible, that a video (.mp4 or etc) had two video streams and we could to do work with each stream individually ? (like we do with 2 audio streams and we can remove any of them)..</p>

<p>1)  do you know which video editors can handle such videos? Adobe Premiere , Sony Vegas, DaVinci or ... ?</p>

<p>2) At this moment, my typical MP4 files are converted by youtube (after upload) to i.e. <code>mpeg-4 10 AVC</code>. And will those 2-stream videos will be converted to 1-stream video anyway? (maybe I have to ask that to YT forum, right?)</p>
","<p>Yes. MPEG-4 Part 14 (the MP4 container format) supports any number of objects (e.g. video, audio and subtitle streams) and isn't limited to only one stream per content type.</p>

<p>In practice however, you seldom see a video file that has multiple video streams, because the range of applications for this is very limited. I would also advise you not to put multiple video streams into one file, as (a) users don't expect it, many won't know how to switch the video track or not notice there is a second video track at all and (b) many players (soft- and hardware) aren't equipped to play files with multiple video streams and either won't have any option to switch between streams or fail to play the file completely.</p>

<p>It is also more common to use Matroska (.mkv) containers for video files with multiple audio/subtitle streams, but even with those, you rarely see files with more than one video stream.</p>

Thanks ;)</p>
","<p>The easiest way to do this is to sync the scaling and make a cross dissolve between them as you do the scaling.  You want it to fade fairly quickly as you work your way in.  One layer would be the many images in whatever arrangement you want, the other would be the overall logo.  This is also often the technique used for doing a smooth zoom in on a satellite image from a very high level to a lower level.</p>

<p>If you time the fades right, it isn't that noticeable as you move to progressively more detailed images because the more detailed image is starting in while it is still small enough to not be distinguishable.</p>

<p>To keep the sizes manageable, you may also have to do multiple images to transition through.  Don't bring one in to the timeline until the previous image is big enough that details of it will start being noticeable.  Also, be sure to remove the larger previous image from the timeline once the newer image completely covers it.</p>

"Automated rendering of After Effects or similar","442","","<p>Initially posted on <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/70707/automated-rendering-of-after-effects-or-similar"">graphicdesign.stackexchange.com</a>:</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to integrate animations into our existing product. The animations would essentially be 30 second commercials containing some variable data (names, dates, numbers). The system needs to automatically render the animation when the user pushes a button. These are non-technical users, so it needs to be all very black-box.</p>

<p>It looks to me like we could use After Effects for this, but I am not a designer so I'm looking for confirmation and suggestions from the experts. This is how I see it working:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a designer create an AE project for each desired animation. </li>
<li>The AE project is set up to pull the variable data from a file at render time. </li>
<li>When our user pushes the button, the system generates the data file and puts it into a folder known to the AE project. </li>
<li>The system then kicks off the render using <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/automated-rendering-network-rendering.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aerender.exe</a>.</li>
<li>When rendering is complete, the system shows the animation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this sound like a reasonable way to proceed? Any alternative suggestions?</p>

<p>One area I'm concerned about is the data merge part. Can an AE project be set up to automatically do that at the time of rendering (i.e. initiated by <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/automated-rendering-network-rendering.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aerender.exe</a>)?</p>
","<p>After Effects can be automated using the Adobe extendscript scripting language,  and can be run from the command line, meaning that it can be integrated into other processes.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/aftereffects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Extendscript</a> is JavaScript and it works across Adobe's product line (to varying degrees, you can use it to script Photoshop for instance). If you have a JavaScript developer available then this would be a relatively straightforward task.</p>

<p>There are also third party frameworks such as <a href=""http://dataclay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Dataclay</a> that make the process easier for non-technical users to avoid scripting, but they are relatively pricey, though they might work out cheaper than hiring a developer and rolling your own.</p>

","<p>A custom video resolution has no bearing on quality here; only the choice of encoder, bitrate/rate factor and other parameters will impact the final result.</p>

<p>Youtube's player frame on its site is always 16:9, so if your video has an aspect ratio other than 16:9, YT will automatically add black bars as necessary. No need for the uploader to do so. However, if you decide to embed videos hosted on Youtube elsewhere, you can specify a custom frame size in your embed code which matches the aspect ratio of your uploaded video. In which case, your video will be displayed with no black bars. So, best practice is to never manually append black bars.</p>

<p>I have used handbrake to try and accomplish this but I am not sure how to make the best settings for this. Here's what I have come up with, but I am not sure what exactly I am getting out of it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4VwEm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I don't necessarily mind if the video is anamorphic or not as long as it consistently displays 640 x 480. I don't know if it makes a difference, but this will be web videos in an HTML5 player. Currently, the player is designed to declare only the video width, so the height is whatever the ratio-correct number should be. I honestly don't know if this works for anamorphic videos.</p>

<p>All I really want here is the best settings to convert this HDV to an Mp4 that will be shown in an HTML5 player with the full screen aspect ratio at a maximum resolution of 640 x 480.</p>
","<p>Whenever you publish something to end-users you ALWAYS want square pixels, everything else WILL make problems.</p>

<p>So just convert your anamorphic video to a square pixel aspect ratio. Handbrake should automatically handle that, the settings you have right now should output a video with square pixel aspect ratio. Just add the vertical resolution.</p>

<p>Is there any reason why you would want to crop your video to 4:3? A down-scaled 16:9 square pixel resolution would equal to 640x360 for a ""SD"" resolution (bare in mind there are several different DVD standards) and I would suggest you to use that resolution and don't just crop your video unless you have an artistic reason for that.</p>

<p>If handbrake is unable to handle the non-square pixels you will have to reside to use either a full fledged video editor or alternatively FFmpeg.</p>

"Best HD camcorder for recording sports","438","","<p>I’m looking to start recording sporting events, specifically professional wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA) events. Initially these will be recorded for DVD, but one of the events will be self-produced and I’d like it to be of good quality that I could potentially sell it to a local TV station.</p>

<p>What should I look for in a HD camcorder for recording such fast-paced events?</p>
","<p>Nothing really. All recent camcorders are more than enough for what you want.</p>

<p>Two things to look: </p>

<ol>
<li>That shutter speed can change so that you can define how smooth motion you want</li>
<li>That they offer fast zoom/focus capabilities for sports.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any recent cam-corder from major companies already covers this.</p>

<p>If you want quality sound you should also look for a camcorder that has an external mic jack so that you can connect your own microphone. This raises the budget a lot.</p>

"Transfer project from one application to another","432","","<p>As a beginner, I would like to know how important it is which software I decide to start out with. (Currently eyeing Adobe Premiere Elements and Sony Movie Studio 13).</p>

<p>I realize that whichever one I'll use, if I decide to switch application, I'll need to learn the other's interface and terminology. However, I was wondering about something else - Can I transfer a project from one to the other. Say I want to make a change to a video I created in one application, and obviously I don't want to input the created video (both because I lose resolution, and because I want each sound track separate etc.) - is it possible to transfer the video to other video editors, or will this project be ""stuck"" to this editor?</p>
","<p>There are ways to transfer projects between different video editing programs, but they are <strong>very</strong> limited. Take a look at <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/14885/how-can-i-save-the-project-for-premiere-cs-5-5/14887#14887"">my answer here</a>; this question is about transfering projects between different versions of Premiere Pro, but the answer is basically the same. You can export a project as an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_decision_list"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edit Decision List (EDL)</a>, however this will only contain the arrangement of the clips in the timeline (namely your <em>edit decisions</em>, hence the name), any effects, e.g. color-grading, will be lost. Another format that does basically the same is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Authoring_Format"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AAF</a>. I'm not sure about the differences between both formats, but either way, most of your post-production efforts will be lost when transfering the project to a different program.</p>

<p>Also, this applies to prosumer-/production-level software. I'm not sure whether ""low-end"" software supports importing and exporting EDL-files. If I remember correctly, it's not possible with Premiere Elements; don't know about the Sony programs (you should be able to find that out over the developer's websites and/or Google).</p>

","<p>I don't think there is a way to accomplish this, since you can apply effects on nested sequences as well as to single clips, which means the nested sequence might look different in the main sequence than it does in the nested one. My humble guess is that that is also the reason why Premiere does not use the existing preview files.</p>

<p>A workaround would be to export the nested sequence and re-import the rendered file in your project, replacing the nested sequence. This of course means you won't be able to make changes to that part of your video anymore, as well as a slight loss in quality (unless you export the sequence using a visually lossless codec such as ProRes or DNxHD) ...</p>

lets start:</p>

<p>we need a 3d model of a phone, lets say, an iphone (properly modeled, textured), then we need a shot of a moving finger which we will use later on. lets say we have everything.</p>

<p>after we have the idea, what we should do with the finger(adequately having this shots on green screen so we can remove the background) we animate the phone in a 3d package, after we are satisfied with the result, we render the phone sequence out from the package (properly lighten and rendered with alpha channel - ready for compositing)
Open after effects or any other compositing software, we put the a white background as solid, then we put the phone sequence on top of the background, the sequence goes, we put the finger where we want him to interact with the phone, since our phone has no animations on it, we can put them in 3d or we can add them in after effects, a little bit of tweaking and there you are, you got your 3d rotating phone with a finger and a hand interacting with it.</p>

<p>if we want to comp anything with the phone in aftereffects, we need the rotation and camera information from the 3d package, lets say cinema4d, we can export ae proj file out, with all the info wee need, and later use that data in after effects to have the perfect sync. Other way around is to have a properly UV for the phone, and put in animation sequence on the screen material, the render it out, then we have just to sync the figer with the animation.

"How did cameramen manually focus in the film days?","427","","<p>In the days before LCDs and digital cameras, manually focusing an interchangeable lens still camera wasn't a whole lot different than it is today. In most designs, you had a mirror that gave the photographer a through-the-lens view, allowing them to accurately focus. When the shutter button was pressed, the mirror flipped out of the way, exposing the film.</p>

<p>However, this method is obviously not usable for the continuous focusing required by video camera operators. Modern cameras solve this problem by using Live View. How was this problem solved in the film days?</p>
","<p>There are two main ways this was solved:</p>

<h1>1. Measuring Focus</h1>

<p>When using this method, the focus puller measures the distances at every point during the shot, and then pulls focus to these marks, at times making adjustments when an actor or grip misses their mark.</p>

<p>This still occurs today, however is becoming less prevalent due to the filmmaking styles being used (handheld, where the same marks are not hit each time).</p>

<h1>2. Video Assist</h1>

<p>Using one of several methods, including half-silvered mirrors, CCD sensors behind the film negative, and telecine transfers, a video split is made. On modern productions shooting on film, this split is what is sent to 'Video Village', where the director sits.</p>

<h2><strike>Telecine Transfer</strike> (Not the correct term)</h2>

<p>I've never really understood how it worked, until now, so I present this lovely diagram from Wikipedia:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqiaC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In essence, the light shines in and exposes the negative. After that, it passes through a series of half-silvered mirrors, each time being split into separate light components and recorded onto an imaging chip. These are them combined, and displayed in the viewfinder, or as a video-out.</p>

<p>One side effect of this method, is the mechanical shutter is visible, as a black screen lasting 1/50th of a second, 25 times a second (whenever the negative itself is not exposed).</p>

<h1>3. Parallel Sight</h1>

<p>Common throughout the 1950s and 60s, having a parallel sight (separate lens, like what you had on a cheap film point-and-shoot camera) allowed the operator to see approximately what was being exposed onto the negative.</p>

<h1>4. Half-Silvered Mirror</h1>

<p><strong>Update: Added from AJ Henderson's comment below.</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned in the comment, a very cheap way of getting an image to a viewfinder was to simply use a half-silvered mirror, somewhere between the lens and the negative. In this way, half the light transmitted through the lens exposes the negative, and half is seen through the operator's viewfinder.</p>

<p>This method does not allow for multiple viewfinders, monitors, or screens, unless another split is created.</p>

<p>I put it into AME to reexport it as DNx115 but when I set it to 1920x1080 23.976 I see letterboxing top and bottom. It says the source clip pixel ratio is 1 and mine is 1.. tried the others for kicks but none get rid of it. </p>

<p>Why am I getting letterbox for this conversion?</p>
","<p>Because 4096 / 1920 = 2.13333 and 2160/1080 = 2.  They are different aspect ratios, so yes, they end up letter boxing when you convert between them.  That is the expected result.</p>

<p>The 4K format you are using is a multiple of 2K and is not the same widescreen aspect ratio as 1080p.  You can't translate between them without letterboxing, though there are several different competing ""4k"" resolutions, so it won't hold true for all ""4k"" formats, but it does for the one you are working with.</p>

<li>There are hundreds of codec/container combinations out there, and maybe your NLE has just problems with the one that you have on your disk. Ex- and importing on different computers/NLEs/operating systems may introduce more unsupported combinations. </li>
</ul></li>

<li>This is about inter-frame vs. intra-frame codecs. The article <a href=""http://www.batchframe.com/quick-tips/tip.php?t=3"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Inter-frame vs Intra-frame | BatchFrame.com"">""Inter-frame vs Intra-frame""</a> has a short explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, inter-frame encoding [...] means that a video file contains sets of grouped frames that reference each other in order to produce an image. [...]
  Intra-frame compression means that each frame is individual and contains all of its own information. The file size will be bigger, but the computer doesn't have to look around to find what it needs.</li>
  </ul>
  Examples of inter-frame codecs are the H.264/mpeg family, while Apple ProRes and Avid DNxHD are intra-frame. GoPro Cineform may also be an intra-frame codec, but I couldn't find enough info to verify it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But to make it short, you only have to consider transcoding, if your playback speed on the timeline is not smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Special filters that should be applied before working with the NLE</p>

<ul>
<li>This may be the case, if you have some filters/effects that your transcoding software can apply, but not your NLE. Or your NLE sometimes forgets these effects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, there are some good reasons to transcode, but you should know, if they apply in your case and are worth the effort. Then choose a high quality intra-frame codec, but not mpeg.</p>

"What equipment should I get for starting out making professional quality films?","425","","<p>I want to start two short film projects but I don't know what equipment I need to get a good professional quality result. I've been saving some money so I hope budget is not a problem. Also, what's most commonly used to record audio in this kind of project? I want to get the sound from two people talking with the camera placed far away from them. I'm trying to make an independent production company so I'm seeing this as an investment. The cheaper the better though.</p>
","<p>For videography, the best bang for your buck is, hands down, going to be an entry level DSLR and a decent lens.  For audio, if your budget can allow for it, I suggest getting a stand alone multi-track recorder.  The Zoom H4n is a particularly popular model with videographers for its low price and decent (though not superb) audio quality.  (Update: The H5 and H6 are now available offering significant upgrades over the H4n, but also at a slightly higher price point.)</p>

<p>There are far better options and values as you get more skill in the field, however for starting out, you probably don't want to invest too much until you get some experience under your belt.  It's easy to spend upwards of $10 to $15 grand on a nice videography setup as you get more and more professional, but a $1500-$1700 setup with something like a Canon T4i or Lumix G2 with a moderate level lens and an H4n or similar for recording audio (with some basic shotgun or lavaliere mics) is a decent start.</p>

<p>Also, be sure not to skimp on a tripod.  You'll want a solid, sturdy tripod (probably aluminum) with a good fluid tripod head to make sure you can get steady shots.  Just a solid tripod alone can run you in to the $350 to $500 range.</p>

<p>If you'll be shooting indoors, you may also need a light kit.  A cheap 3 point lighting kit can be had for a couple hundred dollars, though depending on what you intend to shoot, you may be able to get by without this initially.</p>

<p>So overall breakdown I'd recommend starting out is around $500 to $600 on an entry level DSLR, $150 to $300 on a lens (if your DSLR body supports video auto focus, such as the Canon T4i, a stepper motor lens is needed), about $280 for an audio recorder, about $100 to $200 on mics, about $400 on a tripod and optionally about $150-$250 on lights.  Altogether, that's about $1600 or $1850 and you should be able to make some pretty solid professional looking stuff.  </p>

<p>It does add up quickly, but the good news is that you can improve on the gear incrementally over time once you have the basics.  If you do have more than 2 grand to start out with, I'd spend a little bit extra on the lens or the camera body to get better low light performance and better background blur.  Better mics or mic boom arms also couldn't hurt and if you do go with lights, light modifiers or more powerful lights is also never a bad investment, though the best place to spend any extra money is going to depend on the kind of shooting you are planning on doing.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer and time!</p>
","<p>A fig rig would be an excellent choice for an action piece. If the fig is out of your budget range look at the Opteka X-Grip. Cheap ($30) and pretty flexible, especially if you mount it sideways instead of with the handle parallel to the lens barrel when the shot needs it.</p>

<p>Also if you have access to After Effects spend some time learning the stabilization and tracking capabilities. That will probably improve your shots, helps with rolling shutter issues too that you may experience on a DSLR.</p>

<p>Borrow a tripod. Lots of tripods sitting around in closets in this world.</p>

<p>Edit: Audio is the achilles heal of DSLR video. Make sure you take that into consideration. You can pick up some decent but cheap shotgun microphones that will plug into the D7000, that will help. Also consider grabbing an H4, or several H1s.</p>

"inserting video clip into another video but keep original audio","423","","<p>I need to replace video in a larger mp4 file with a smaller mp4 clip - but leaving the original (larger clip) audio intact.</p>

<p>So for example I might want the first 2 seconds of SmallClip.mp4 to replace the video in LargeClip.mp4 starting at (say) 10 seconds in to LargeClip.mp4.</p>

<p>The format of both clips is likely to be identical, so I'm hoping I can copy instead of decoding for speed etc (I'll have to do it a lot).</p>

<p>Finally, I might want to do exactly the same thing but in several places in LargeClip.mp4 - all places in the output getting the video replaced with the same input clip's video.  I'd be happy to do this in multiple oerations if neccessary but if it were possible on one command so much the better :)</p>

<p>I'm reading up on the options for ffmpeg but I'm new to it and haven't figured it out yet.  Any help much appreciated!</p>
","<p>You can use the concat demuxer in ffmpeg to do this. For accurate splicing, re-encoding is needed which is what the commands below do.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Prepare the concat text file</p>

<p>You must first create a plaintext file, say, <code>concat.txt</code>, like this</p>

<pre><code>file 'LargeClip.mp4'
inpoint 0.0
duration 10.0
file 'SmallClip.mp4'
inpoint 0.0
outpoint 2.0
file 'LargeClip.mp4'
inpoint 12.0
duration 5.0
file 'SmallClip.mp4'
inpoint 23.0
duration 4.0
file 'LargeClip.mp4'
inpoint 21.0
</code></pre>

<p>This shows the first 10 seconds of LargeClip, then the first two seconds of smallclip, then resumes the Largeclip at 12:00, shows it for 5 seconds, then splices in 23:00 to 27:00 of small clip, switches back to LargeClip at its 21:00 and keeps it till its end. These timecodes, in seconds, refer to the source file timecode, not of the assembled output.</p>

<p>Make sure that the sync of LargeClip isn't broken, i.e. after switching to SmallClip for 12 seconds, you want to resume LargeClip 12 seconds later from where you left it off.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Concat the video streams</p>

<p>This command will skip the audio since we don't to splice the audio streams.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f concat -i concat.txt -an -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -fflags +genpts spliced-vid.mp4
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Insert the audio from LargeClip</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i spliced-vid.mp4 -i LargeClip.mp4 -c copy -map 0:v -map 1:a Final.mp4 
</code></pre>

","<p>Have you considered buying an entirely separate set of QR plates to unify your entire setup? For instance, in our setup, we use a tripod, a monopod, and a GlideCam with various attachments for each of these (rail systems, teleprompters, etc.).

"Properly working with vector files","420","","<p>I have a project that I've edited in Davinci Resolve 12 where I want to add a logo in the beginning. However, Resolve won't import either PDF, SVG or EPS format, so I created a high resolution PNG of the logo instead. Even though the PNG file looks fine on its own when looking at it, when bringing it into Resolve, it gets very pixely.</p>

<p>As a backup solution, I tried importing the original PDF into Final Cut Pro X instead and exporting a MOV file that I could bring into Resolve. However, the logo got pixely when exporting it from FCPX as well.</p>

","<p>Ok, so I solved it myself, and it wasn't pretty.</p>

<p>To be able to work with my vector file in Davinci Resolve 12 (and in Final Cut Pro X without loosing any detail), I first had to convert it into a font. Yes, you read that correctly. I had to create a font where I assigned my logo to a specific character and then use the font in my editing program.</p>

Its fine and rendering times are ok, but I recently began toying around with After Effects and the computer begins to lag behind.</p>

<p>I have more or less 1000 dollars to blow and I found a Dell XPS 8900 for around that price. I checked the specs sheet and it seemed really good.</p>

<p>An i7 6700 Quad-Core processor, 16GB of RAM expandable to 32GB, 2TB 7200rpm drive and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 745 with 4GB of RAM. </p>

<p>I don't shoot in 4k in my spare time and when they ask me to, I'm not the one editing the footage.</p>

<p>Is this good enough and fast enough? If not, any recommendations for a PC or a laptop is greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>For editing, I would definitely get a desktop PC, and a custom built one at that, not one from the shelf, as the latter will always be more expensive. Also, this way you only have to pay for the parts you need and can avoid bottlenecks. For example, the PC you mentioned doesn't have an SSD, so hard drive speed will be a limiting factor. Also, the GPU is sub-par compared to the CPU. </p>

<p>Here's what I would recommend, should be doable with 1000 $ (Look out for assembling fees, some dealers will charge you up to 100 bucks, some will do it for 20. You could also do it yourself if you are confident enough):</p>

<ul>
<li>An i7-processor. Since you should be getting a GPU anyway, you can get a Xeon E3 processor instead (basically an i7 without an integrated graphics unit, it's slightly cheaper). For example, I have the <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/80910/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1231-v3-8M-Cache-3_40-GHz"" rel=""nofollow"">Xeon E3 V1231 v3</a>.</li>
<li>An nVidia GPU with CUDA support. You could get a GTX 970, even though they are somewhat outdated. Alternatively, you could wait for the new Pascal architecture cards, however those will be much more expensive at launch. Alternatively, you could get an AMD R9 390, which only supports OpenCL but might be ever so slightly more powerful than the GTX 970.</li>
<li>A cheap HDD for storage as well as an SSD for fast editing. You don't need a Samsung Evo, it's a myth that those are better than the cheaper brands. For example, I have a 250GB Crucial BX100 and it's working perfectly fine.</li>
<li>At least 16 GB RAM.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm trying to gather info for a project here at work where we need the ability to remotely control various cameras during a webinar presentation from a host computer.</p>

<p>Ideal would be the cameras have the ability to pan/tilt/zoom on their own, but as I've found out PTZ cameras are expensive.</p>

<p>I know we can use something cheap like the Logitech Orbit camera, but we'd really like the ability to have decent video cameras hooked up to a multi-input control video box and then also have them on tripods that can control their p/t/z if that even exists.</p>

","<p>You want a Pan/Tilt head.  Zoom will depend on having a camera that can have the zoom remote controlled and a remote control that can hook in to the zoom.  A pan tilt head can generally either be left sitting on a table or threaded on to a tripod.  They are, however, not cheap.  Expect to spend at least $300 for a cheap one and more if the camera ways more than a couple pounds.</p>

","<p>Ducking is a great solution for broadcast audio (for example, muting crowd noise when a commentator is trying to explain what's happening on the field).  In production, the limitations of ducking become apparent: sometimes it's too much or too little, sometimes it needs to be faster than the default, or slower.  These are things that are not necessarily obvious the first time you listen, but become obvious after the second or third listening.</p>

<p>Broadcast audio production presumes you hear things only once, so the limitations of ducking are acceptable.  If you are producing material that people might watch more than once, you really should do the ducking manually, setting audio keyframes and moving the volume manually to maximize not only quality and intelligibility, but also emotion and impact.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBwH4.png"" alt=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2UZl4.png""></p>
","<p>This happens with <code>interlaced video</code>. Interlaced video is drawn to the screen in two passes, first the odd lines from top to bottom, then the even lines from bottom to top.</p>

<p>This is a legacy thing inherited from the days of good ol' CRT tubes when the dots on the screen was drawn using a beam; and to optimize the physical limitations of that the beam could not be all places at once this method where used together with phosphoric layer to reduce flicker.</p>

<p>With this you end up with two half frames (odd and even lines). Now, this is also the way video is captured on many video cameras. The exception is progressive recording where a single frame is recorded at once, like with analogue film cameras.</p>

<p>The problem you see happens when something moves fast and the odd lines captures one position of the object, while the process is about to capture the even lines the object has moved enough to be visible on the two merged half-frames.</p>

<p>Of course, you can drop one half-frame and use various techniques to for example interpolate the remaining lines, but always with a loss of quality as a result.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Allow me to edit out commercials anywhere in the video.</p>

<p>Any modern editor can do this (<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html"">Adobe Premier</a>, <a href=""http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegassoftware"">Sony Vegas,</a> <a href=""https://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/"">Final Cut</a> etc) including light-weight (ex. <a href=""http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/"">Pinnacle Studio</a>) and <a href=""http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html"">free editors</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After editing, it keeps the 5.1 Surround Sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Provided your original clip contains 5.1 channels and your editing environment is set up with (and can support, see more professional packages) 5.1 support, and you export in a format that support 5.1, this is granted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Burn the video to a Blu-Ray player or save it to disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As long as you export in a format supported by the BD-disk creator software, or a format that can be trans-coded, no problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ability to add menus too my Blu-Rays.</p>

<p>This most BD-disk creator software can do (see for example <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/encore.html"">Adobe Encore</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there are logos on the screen(say ESPN logo), be able tell the software to find all instances and remove it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very specific task and as you say, you need to tell the software to find these. You can do this by combining a tracker to the logo and a script that can follow. When logo is ""lost"" for the tracker, init a method in the script that do what you want. This as said, will be very specific and it will require you to program your script very specific.</p>

<p>IMO it will be quicker to go through these manually. especially if you know the material you're working with or at least what to expect of it.</p>

<li>Hide everything except the Events and Projects that belong together in the same Library. Event Manager X is a great tool for this, as Jason suggested in the comments.

"How to calculate the length of the video file that was encoded so far?","402","","<p>I am using <code>ffmpeg</code> to convert a video file to H.264 format. If I call <code>ffprobe</code> while <code>ffmpeg</code> is still running the duration of the video is not known. Only when <code>ffmpeg</code> finishes the <code>ffprobe</code> will display the duration.</p>

<p>Similar, if I run <code>mplayer</code> to play the video while it is still being encoded the duration is either unknown or displays incorrectly.</p>

<p>Is there a way to know duration of the resulted video (h264 in .mkv container) while it is still being encoded by <code>ffmpeg</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <em>I will make the question a little bit more clear.</em></p>

<p>I am interested in knowing how long is the video which was encoded <strong>so far</strong>. Let's say the input file is 1 minute 45 seconds long. The resulting file should preserve the length. But I would like to know how much did <code>ffmpeg</code> encode <strong>so far</strong>. If we can determine the length of the video after conversion is done, shouldn't there be a way to determine the length of the video that was already processed and ready to be played?</p>
","<p>Short answer is No.</p>

<p>Longer answer is, it depends.</p>

<p>If you're encoding a file, then generally the output is the duration of the input, unless there's speed change or trim filters or <code>-ss, -to, -t</code> options applied. For a live input, FFmpeg will stop the encode when it encounters EOF on the input, so unless you know that, you won't know the output duration. For multiple inputs of differing duration, it will depend on what the command is e.g. is there a <code>-shortest</code> in there, is there an <code>amix</code>, which defaults to the longest of the inputs, or <code>amerge</code> which terminates upon the shortest input.</p>

<p>By default, the ffmpeg console readout will display the progress of the encoding in realtime i.e. the duration encoded, so far.</p>

"Container Type that doesn't corrupt on Encoding Crash","400","","<p>I've been produce videos on YouTube for a few years. I understand a vast majority of encoding options for x264 (My preferred encoder).</p>

<p>I used to use MPEG-4 containers (.mp4) with my videos, however my system isn't the most powerful and the encoder will sometimes crash mid-encoding, causing the file to be unreadable because of how MPEG-4 file data is organized.</p>

<p>So I switched to using FLV as the container, and remuxing it to MPEG-4 after recording is done. FLV's organization of the data allows the file to be read, even if the file was never completed. I don't understand much about the actual formats, but Id suspect it's an absence of a footer in the format for FLV.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having with FLV, is that when I used MP4, I record with multiple audio tracks, so that I can edit them independently. FLV does not support multiple audio streams.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is a container for x264, that's still high quality, allows for multiple audio tracks, and can still be read if encoding crashes.</p>

<p>I am recording with a program called OBS-Studio (OBS Multi-Platform), which allows the following containers for x264: FLV, MP4, MOV, MKV, TS</p>

<p>Are any of those last 3 formats capable of such functionality. I have tried a few days of research and can't find anything regarding this.</p>

<p>But in both cases the subtitles came out stretched. Is there anything I can do to get them square—either with the ffmpeg command or the subtitle file? I'd rather not stretch the video twice, it's already looking a bit shabby.</p>

<p>It can also include information like production name, date, cameraman, director, timecode, etc. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Myiln.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>That gadget actually combines TWO different functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>SLATE which is the lower portion that identifies Scene / Take / Roll, etc. in written form so that the camera(s) can document exactly what this clip is. Without that information editing would be an absolute nightmare for big productions.</li>
<li>CLAPPER which is the part at the top. Essentially two sticks that are snapped together to establish picture vs. sound SYNCHRONIZATION. The camera(s) can see exactly when the two parts come together, and the microphone can ""hear"" when the sticks snap. That sound transient is used to exactly synchronize the sound recording (which is typically done on a separate recorder) with the film or video recording. </li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes they even put a wireless mic on the slate/clapper to properly ""hear"" the snap, especially for huge scenes where there is no microphone near where the slate/clapper needs to be (to be seen by all the cameras).</p>

<p>What people CALL that gadget depends on tradition and the preferences of the director, etc.</p>

"Avid import wmv file, just audio no video","382","","<p>I've got a few wmv files, when I import them into avid it seems that the video channel is not being imported. There's just audio. </p>

<p>Am I missing something in the import stage? Or in the handling of the sequence?</p>
","<p>This is likely due to the video codec that you are using. First, an explanation of terms is required: WMV is a container format. These can contain one or more video or audio streams - with video this is normally one video &amp; one audio stream; and these are encoded with various codecs (coder/decoder). I'm not very familiar with the WMV format - for editing I use proper intermediate codecs (Apple ProRes in my case; more in this in a moment), and I prefer MP4 as a delivery codec.</p>

<p>There are broadly three 'types' of video codec: capture codecs, that a video camera will use to record the video; intermediate codecs, that are more suited to post-production editing (they trade larger files for requiring less processing power &amp; the ability to easily cut on any frame); and delivery codecs, that are more compressed (so they can be streamed over the internet, or so you can fit a decent length on a physical medium like a DVD, or for broadcast). There is some overlap between these (many DSLRs use h.264, which is designed to be a delivery codec, to capture video).</p>

<p>This stuff also applies to audio - though there you should use uncompressed PCM audio. However, since audio decompression requires far less processing power, some NLEs will allow you to get away with compressed audio.</p>

<p>I have never heard of the WMV format containing any intermediate formats, as far as I know it's a purely delivery format. That's probably the cause of your problem. I've never used Avid, so I don't know  exactly which intermediate codec you should use. Since it's designed by Avid, the DNxHD codec is a good bet for video (you should convert your audio to PCM audio while you're at it).</p>

<p>Your video editing software probably came with a media conversion tool. You could also use the command-line-based <a href=""https://ffmpeg.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">ffmpeg</a> (<a href=""http://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a>) to encode to DNxHD. For the following command, you would need to adjust the bit rate - here it is 36 megabits/second - see <a href=""http://www.itbroadcastanddigitalcinema.com/ffmpeg_howto.html#Encoding_VC-3"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for some information on what you should use. Note that the ffmpeg syntax used in that guide is somehat out of date; you should use <code>-c:v</code> instead of <code>-vcodec</code> and <code>-b:v</code> instead of <code>-b</code>. This following command will also convert the audio to uncompressed 16-bit PCM, for maximum compatibility:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.wmv -c:v dnxhd -b:v 36M -c:a pcm_s16le output.mov

"How to help the autofocus feature of an amateur camcorder","380","","<p>I just acquired an amateur camcorder (Samsung HMX-Q10) that has only a few settings available, most of them are automatic.</p>

<p>I tried to shoot a video of me playing a bass guitar cover but it seems that the image is always slightly out of focus. I'm just slightly blurred but with HD image this kind of detail is really noticeable.</p>

<p><strong>Shooting environment</strong> : me standing in front of the camcorder (~2-3 meters) with an instrument, in my appartment (walls mostly white), natural winter/cloudy lighting, white /  bright brown background, black clothes, red guitar.</p>

<p><strong>Cam specifications/settings</strong> : Full HD 1920x1080/50i, Exposure Value : 0, Shutter 1/50 of a second (there is a ""low light mode"" that set it to 1/25 but it adds colored artifacts).</p>

<p>I can't notice that the image is blurred on the camcorder small monitoring screen, but when I open the video on the computer it is more obvious (especially because the guitar brand label is blurred), so without proper feedback it is quite hard to manually set the focus.</p>

<p>So what can I do to help the autofocus ?<br>
What can I change in the shooting environment to improve its accuracy ?</p>

<p>I'm thinking, maybe the lighting, the colors (background / clothes), some camcorder settings, another element I forgot ?</p>
","<p>I reviewed the specifications for the Samsung HMX-Q10 and have to say there is not a whole lot of information e.g., optics has no mention of ""Minimum Focus Distance"". So we are pretty much in the dark on the near boundary of the depth of field.</p>

<p>(a little rant on auto-focus)</p>

<p>Most auto focus systems have two modes: Single AF and Full-time AF. Single AF translates into setting the focus once, focusing what ever the sensor picks up first usually in the center of the frame (there are other possible areas depending on the camera, but I'm guessing this Samsung is limited to center weighted focus). Single AF keeps the same focus area during the whole shot. Full-time AF changes focus according to what is changing in the frame. This would be good for tracking a sports event or something moving. Unfortunately the Samsung specs don't mention any of this so I am not sure if this camera has two modes, or one, or if one mode, which one Samsung made the default.</p>

<p>Here is how I would approach shooting your bass playing.</p>

<p>1) mount the camera on a tripod so the camera is steady.</p>

<p>2) Likely 1 meter to 2 meters will be far enough away to be in focus. I recommend that you
   experiment with this to see if 1 meter is better than 2 or if 2 is better than 3 meters.</p>

<p>3) light the set with as much light as you can as this will force the auto-exposure to
   'stop-down' the iris as in a smaller aperture, which translates into more depth of 
   field.</p>

<p>4) in front of the camera, dead center, put a chair or something where you will be playing,
   (use some gaffers tape to mark this spot off camera on the floor assuming your not
   going to show your feet) this will force the auto-focus to focus on the space you are
   going to be.</p>

<p>5) set the camera zoom to full wide (the wider you set the lens, the greater the depth
   of field).</p>

<p>6) press the record button, walk to your spot toss the chair or prop that was standing in
   for you and start your action. All the stuff that happened before you started playing
   your bass can be cut out in post production.</p>

<p>Alternately you can have a friend stand in for you on your mark before you start the camera, you could even have them give an intro then decide later to keep it or cut it and go direct to the bass playing. Also, you could have an assistant do all this camera work for you while you stay in place to start the show.</p>

<p>Quick review:
1) tripod to steady the camera,
2) lots of light,
3) set zoom to widest angle,
4) have your spot in focus before you start.</p>

<p>What is the best wattage between these two for a near natural lighting? If not what is the right ammount of wattage to archive it?</p>
","<p>Wattage has nothing to do with achieving natural lighting.  The amount of diffusion and placement does.  More light is ALWAYS better because it results in more signal to the camera and more options as far as ISO, aperture and shutter speed.  </p>

<p>Nothing you setup with artificial lights (particularly on your budget) will come close to the level of the sun on even a cloudy day.  This doesn't matter though as long as you provide enough light for the camera to pick it up and spread it out through diffusers and light placement and reflectors such that you get a natural look.</p>

<p>I'd suggest reading some on 3 point lighting if you want more information on light placement and get the biggest diffusers you can, though on your budget, you will be hard pressed to get even a decent 3 point light kit, let alone any kind of diffusers.  (A decent large diffuser alone will run over $100.)  Your best bet is to put all the money in to the best light kit you can get and get diffusers later.  Proper three point lighting will still be fairly natural looking.</p>

"How to make sense of video file formats?","378","","<p>In digital video, there are all these different kinds of files: m4v, mov, mkv, mts, mp4, mpeg, and a host of others, and I can't seem to find a clear answer as to what each is good for.</p>

<p>(By contrast, when you're taking still pictures, you have two choices: JPG or RAW; with JPG, you basically know what the file contains, and with RAW, it's going to vary by camera manufacturer. I know it's a little more complicated than that, but it's nothing like the explosion of options available in digital video.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems like the video's file extension doesn't tell you what's inside the file. From what I understand, a .mov file (for example) could contain just about anything.</p>

<p>Then there is this whole thing about h.264, AIC, ProRes, iFrame, AVCHD, DV, HDV -- at least I think those all belong to the same category, but I'm probably mistaken.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me understand all the different variables that are in play here so that I can make intelligent choices about what I do with the files coming off my camcorder?</p>
","<p>File formats are essentially wrappers, a container of sorts. The video information is encoded in a codec (Coder/Decoder). Some file formats only work with certain codecs. This is due (in part) to corporate/organizational pissing contests (or format wars - remember dvd+ vs. dvd -?). Codecs come with varying degrees of compression. The more compressed a codec is, the smaller your files will be, but they will also potentially be losing information, in the same way that a RAW file saves everything from CCD, and JPEG compresses the file by dropping repeated information. Also, most pro level NLEs (like Final Cut Pro (not FCPX)) play nicer with codecs that are less compressed. The more compressed it is the more the computer has to work to decode and re-enconde the information when you make changes (moving on the time line, cutting, adding effects etc.)</p>

<p>Recommendations:
For recording and editing (HD), pick a low compression, high quality codec such as DVCProHD, AVCHD, Apple ProRes.</p>

<p>To export for sharing I recommend H.264. It is supported nearly universally and is very good quality with relatively small files. BluRay videos are actually encoded in an ultra high quality H.264</p>

<p>One other note: if your camcorder saves files in a weird format (ie. not mov, mpeg, mp4), you will need to use a transfer process in your NLE. Be sure to save the ENTIRE folder structure from your memory card, not just the mts, mxf, or whatever files.</p>

<p>More tips: if you're not sure what codec a file is in, you can open it in QuickTime and hit cmd+i to open the inspector window. It will have all the codec information there.
Additionally, on Windows there is a small utility called G-SPOT which can show you what codec are you using on that file etc.</p>

"How do I resize the canvas of a image layer in After Effects?","377","","<p>I'm using <strong>After Effects CC 2017</strong>. I've imported a PNG image with transparency, then I added a simple <strong>CC Light Wipe</strong> effect:</p>

"Tool to transcode Canon PF24 MTS files to native 24p?","373","","<p>Many Canon AVCHD camcorders record 24fps in a format they call PF24, which essentially disguises the 24 fps in a 60i stream by applying 3:2 pulldown.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they do this so well that to my knowledge editors can't detect it automatically and apply the reverse transformation. I have verified that this is true for Sony Vegas Pro 10 on Windows and FCPX on OS X, which treat these files as regular 60i material. When these clips are added to a 24p timeline they get the regular deinterlacing treatment, which looks awful.</p>

<p>Are there any tools (command line preferred) that can take a .MTS file with PF24 material and perform the inverse telecine process to convert to native 24p with minimal quality loss?</p>
","<p>The usual tool recommended for this is JES Deinterlacer, which apparently has an adaptive method of finding and removing the 'smear' frames. I haven't used it myself.</p>

<p>The reason this is an issue is that the field cadence used for PF24 is (stupidly, IMO) different from the typical telecine cadence, which is what most 'inverse telecine' algos detect and remove. So applying standard inverse telecine just adds another layer of mess-up to the video.</p>

"Android - Media Encoder HEVC Plays, FFMPEG HEVC Won't","367","","<h2>The Problem</h2>

","<p>With <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/users/1871/mulvya"">Mulvya's</a> help, I figured out the issue. FFMPEG was using a codec tag of <code>hev1</code>, while Media Encoder was using <code>hvc1</code>. Nothing I tried in FFMPEG would change this. </p>

<p><a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/users/1871/mulvya"">Mulvya</a> suggested I use mp4box to repackage. <code>mp4box -add out.mp4 -new final.mp4</code> didn't work. But, after a little more searching, I ended up following the suggestion <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32152090/encode-h265-to-hvc1-codec"">here</a> and used mp4box to extract the raw .hvc file from the file that FFMPEG gave me, and repackaged it into a new mp4 file. That seemed to fix it.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>Something that <strong>doesn't</strong> make sense is the fact that I ran a Media Encoder file through FFMPEG with <code>-c copy</code>, and the resulting file had a codec tag of <code>hev1</code>, but it still played on the Odroid players. Based on that, I wouldn't have expected the solution above to work, but it did.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - As pointed out by <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/users/1871/mulvya"">Mulvya</a>, the explanation for the above note is that even with the tag <code>hev1</code>, the stream from Media Encoder has the PS where the player expects it.</p>

"How are 3-dimensional overlays synchronized with videos?","367","","<p>One popular feature on TV nowadays is to create 3D overlays on top of the recorded content. Also, as the camera changes direction or position, the 3D content view is subsequently adjusted. How is this implemented?</p>
","<p>There are two different approaches that can be used.  Motion/Camera tracking and Motion Control.</p>

<p>In Motion or Camera tracking, multiple non-coplanar fixed points in the scene are tracked and from that it is possible to extrapolate the position of the camera within the scene.  This information can then be fed into a virtual camera used to generate the output from the 3d model such that when the 3d model output is superimposed over the video, the movements line up.</p>

<p>Motion Control is similar but uses a special camera rig to either track the camera movement exactly or to reproduce a movement plotted in the 3d software exactly in real life.  This is the more precise but also much more sophisticated approach as it requires far more elaborate gear to do.  It also allows for more accurate tracking of things like change in zoom verses actually moving the camera in (which are otherwise only evident by fairly subtle shifting of perspective and vanishing points.)</p>

<p>The result of both is effectively similar though.  You end up with data on how the camera moves in the real life scene and it matches the movement done in the 3d scene.  There are other factors such as lighting that also have to be matched for the best looking composition.  Then both outputs are brought in to a composition package like After Effects where they can be overlayed and blended together.  Sometimes various additional effects like depth of field and other virtual camera effects may be applied to help it blend.</p>

<p>Another thing is that if anything in the real scene needs to move in front of the 3d object, then they need something called a mask layer.  This is normally produced by rotoscoping, which is a process of updating the image on every frame to follow the subject.  This mask then tells the compositing software that the real video plate should be placed over the 3d plate on the areas where the mask is painted.  Otherwise the 3d plate is used over the real plate.  Alpha channel blending is used to convey information about the transparency of a 3d shape such that the image behind it can be visible.</p>

<p>If the 3d object has any refractive properties, then the real life plate may be fed into the 3d software as an environment.  Then the 3d render engine can actually sample information from the environment in order to figure out refraction in things like a glass object or a 3d object with a mirror.  Since it is mapping a 2d environment onto a 3d one, a lot of the selection of how the environment is applied would be done manually though.</p>

Thjey have also said that they will <em>never</em> charge for h.264 video that is freely distributed.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/14694/mp4-h-264-patent-issues/14699#14699"">MP4 / h.264 patent issues?</a>
for more info.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> if your video is free to view, then h.264 is free for you to use, and as @LordNeckbeard points out, it's a ripper of a codec, so knock yourself out.</p>

"Is H.264 subject to exploits / are some H.264 codecs subject to exploits?","364","","<p>How safe are H.264 streams from exploits? More exactly, are the consumer-grade H.264 codes generally ""safe""?</p>

<p>I am currently gratuitously transcoding A/V files to avoid being exposed to possible exploits. This was after I noticed that some older video files will have very curious errors in them, errors that make me wonder if they are indeed exploit attempts (""strange, why's there a STRING in the middle of the stream?""). I do know that in some older formats/codecs, there were indeed past exploits.</p>

<p>Since H.264 codecs are a bit more modern than some of the older ones, I would like to know if such an elementary stream is safe in the ""usual suspect"" players: Windows Media, VLC, Quicktime and the major browsers (I use Chrome and Firefox, but should include Safari and InternetExploder just in case).</p>

<p>In that case, if the video is an H.264 elementary stream, I would not need to do a sanitization transcode step, and just create a new MP4 container. This would at least remove any container-based exploits. In other words:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i &lt;file&gt; -c copy newcontainer.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>(or -c:v copy, and transcode the audio, etc).</p>

<p>Clearly, white room safety would require transcoding everything, but that's getting all Felix Unger.</p>
","<p>All anyone might be able to say is that there are no <strong>known</strong> holes in the various players.  (I don't know if that's true, just that it's impossible to know that there are no undiscovered bugs in a complex piece of code.)  H.264 streams are complex enough to have lots of corner cases.  They're parsed with speed-optimized code written in C and assembly.</p>

<p>You're quite correct that this is a HUGE attack surface, esp. when you allow arbitrary input formats, including ones with crufty old demuxers / decoders written by some random guy a long time ago, who might or might not have had security in mind.  <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/01/ffmpeg-and-thousand-fixes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> about ffmpeg security fixes is quite interesting.</p>

<p>re: ascii strings inside video files.  That's not uncommon at all.  x264 output embeds a string like</p>

<pre><code>x264 - core 142 r2455 021c0dc - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - Copyleft 2003-2014 - http://www.videolan.org/x264.html - options: cabac=1 ref=6 deblock=1:2:2 analyse=0x3:0x133 me=umh subme=10 psy=1 psy_rd=1.00:0.50 mixed_ref=1 me_range=24 chroma_me=1 trellis=2 8x8dct=1 cqm=0 deadzone=21,11 fast_pskip=1 chroma_qp_offset=-4 threads=6 lookahead_threads=1 sliced_threads=0 nr=200 decimate=1 interlaced=0 bluray_compat=0 constrained_intra=0 bframes=6 b_pyramid=2 b_adapt=2 b_bias=0 direct=3 weightb=1 open_gop=0 weightp=2 keyint=250 keyint_min=25 scenecut=40 intra_refresh=0 rc_lookahead=60 rc=crf mbtree=1 crf=25.0 qcomp=0.60 qpmin=0 qpmax=69 qpstep=4 ip_ratio=1.40 aq=1:0.50
</code></pre>

<p>And of course <code>strings</code> will find lots of sequences of characters in the ascii range, just by random chance.  Some containers use sequences of ascii characters as the magic values to indicate what type of object something is.  e.g. mp4 has ""moov"", ""mdat"", and other atoms.  If you can pick any sequence of 4 bytes for your format, you might as well pick ASCII characters to make things easier to debug.</p>

<p>I think transcoding all incoming video would incur a HUGE quality / CPU / storage overhead.  Transcoding with nightly builds of ffmpeg would potentially shield you from known bugs in the typically old version of ffmpeg in VLC stable releases, and whatever bugs are in closed source stuff from Microsoft and Apple.</p>

<p>Remuxing is not a bad compromise.</p>

<p>There's also a balance between destroying metadata vs. passing through more potentially harmful stuff.  (e.g. chapters, subtitles, ...)</p>

<p>If I were actually doing this, I'd probably store my output in mkv files.  Using a different container is maybe better insurance against any weirdness from an input mp4 getting passed on to an output mp4.</p>

<p>Also, if you're actually doing this, I guess you'd run ffmpeg (or MP4Box for just mp4->mp4 remuxing) in a sandbox chroot or vm, or even just as an un-privileged user, so successful exploits are contained.</p>

<p>However some cameras have audio jacks inputs, to connect external microphone to them. And your Samsung NX1000 have one.

So it is impossible to connect your microphone to your DSLR directly.</p>

<p>You need computer to convert digital signal to analog, and then connect it to your DSLR. It can be achieved with some kind of microcomputer like Raspberry Pi.

Maybe some settings on the PC should be adjusted for this to work properly. But it depends on your operating system.</p>

<p>What Vegas is doing is taking the single channel audio from the timeline, duplicating it, setting a left and right channel, then cuts the set bitrate in half for each channel. So if I want 96kbps mono, I actually end up with  stereo, 48kbps on each channel.</p>

<p>Is this an inherent issue with MainConcept file types? I notice that with others I can actually select mono in the audio tab, but not with MainConcept. I thought I read a short half sentence saying as much on some forum, but not sure.</p>

<p>If there is a way to have an HTML5 compatible MP4 with mono audio, please tell me how.</p>
","<p>The Mainconcept or Sony codecs in Vegas are subpar for low-bitrate output such as needed for HTML5 use. Use ffmpeg to generate your HTML5 videos. Yes, mono audio is acceptable for HTML5 use, but once you use ffmpeg/x264 for generating those videos, the 6kB/s savings you get from switching to mono audio won't matter much if at all.</p>

<p>Get the 32-bit static build of ffmpeg from <a href=""http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Render a high bitrate Mainconcept MP4 from Vegas, say, 12 Mbps. And then run the following ffmpeg command:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i ""vegas-output.mp4"" -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 96k -strict -2 -movflags +faststart ""html5-video.mp4""
</code></pre>

<p>If you still want mono audio, insert</p>

<pre><code>-ac 1
</code></pre>

<p>after aac.</p>

<p>If you don't like the quality or size is too large, then play around with the CRF value. They go from 0 to 63 with lower being better. 18 to 28 is the usual range you want to stick with. </p>

"Ghost position keyframes in After Effects","360","","<p>I have an animation in After Effects where I am animating a slider to move up and down at certain points. The slider should be mainly stationary, but moves occasionally in line with other actions on the project.</p>

"how to use h264_omx on RaspberryPi","359","","<p>I'm using RaspberryPi 1gen B+, for push stream to web through rtmp. But I find my CPU usage came up to 90%+. This is how I use it:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -re -f concat -safe 0 -i playlist.txt -vcodec copy -acodec aac -f flv ""rtmp://example.com:1060""
</code></pre>

<p>so I want to use the GPU for decode/encode. After google research, I found ""h264_omx"", and I've implement the h264_omx: </p>

<pre><code>pi@pi:/usr/src/ffmpeg $ sudo ./configure --enable-omx --enable-omx-rpi
sudo make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>so I use:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -re -f concat -safe 0 -i playlist.txt -vcodec h264_omx -acodec aac -f flv ""rtmp://example.com:1060""

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YRClP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YRClP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>But the CPU usage still runs to 90%+, what's worse, the video become indistinct and only have 5fps. </p>

<p>so, what's wrong with me? Is it possible for 1gen B+ to hardware codec?</p>
","<p>The first priority here is to determine the bottleneck, particularly on the encoding end first, then moving on elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is noted by the comment on the choppy video stream, indicating frame-skipping.</p>

<p>To do that, we need to isolate the task that takes up the heaviest CPU load.</p>

<p>Try running the FFmpeg snippet with audio encoding only, as you copy the video stream, then monitor CPU load:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -re -f concat -safe 0 -i playlist.txt -c:v copy -c:a aac -f flv ""rtmp://example.com:1060""
</code></pre>

<p>That omits the video encoding phase, so see the new CPU load.</p>

<p>Next step, enable the video encoder but copy the audio stream intact:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -re -f concat -safe 0 -i playlist.txt -c:v h264_omx -c:a copy -f flv ""rtmp://example.com:1060""
</code></pre>

<p>Now, with that snippet, monitor the CPU load again.</p>

<p>You're likely to observe that its' either workload (video or audio encoding) that takes up the larger share of the CPU load, and from there, you can then tune the encoder(s) as you see fit.</p>

<p>To see encoder options for the <code>h264_omx</code> encoder, run:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -h encoder=h264_omx
</code></pre>

<p>And for the <code>aac</code> encoder:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -h encoder=aac
</code></pre>

<p>Then tune the culprit with an acceptable preset and/or settings <em>until an acceptable compromise in quality vs CPU load is reached</em>. Note that some functions such as auto-inserted filters tend to run on the CPU, contributing to the heavy load on the encoder's end.</p>

<p>You can confirm this by running:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -loglevel debug -re -f concat -safe 0 -i playlist.txt -c:v h264_omx -c:a aac -f flv ""rtmp://example.com:1060""
</code></pre>

<p>And monitoring the output. Learn what filters are being auto-inserted, and see if modifying the filter strings (via <code>-vf</code>) assists with the processor load.</p>

","<p>Your source sets the quality ceiling, so transcoding to ProRes won't improve the video quality.</p>

<p>Most likely, the H264 files generated by your camera will be constrained baseline profile i.e. I- and P-frames only, and on a modern machine, decoding shouldn't be an issue. I edit H264 (baseline or main profile) all the time on my i7 and occasionally i5 with nVidia CUDA-enabled GPUs.</p>

This is all offline captioning and the goal is accuracy in copy, placement and timing.</p>

<p>The other main thread (and skill) is live writing or real-time captioning, which is done with stenowriters (chord typing) as used by court reporters. These are always delayed by some time because of the need to hear, interpret and input. It's almost always done remotely, with the caption writer networked into a local encoder. The same bureaus usually offer both live and offline.</p>

If so what would the fps and frame resolution?</p>

<p>Also, what compression method will I need to use? </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>summary: yes, depending on content, with a good encoder h.264 can look pretty good at 240kib/s video bitrate, at NTSC 720x480p30.</p>

<p>With modern codecs, you don't need to downscale the rez too far.  If there isn't a lot of noise in your source, you're just putting the same complexity into fewer pixels.  You shouldn't encode 1080p at 270kb/s, though :P.  There is overhead to having more macroblocks, and diluting the complexity across too many pixels probably means worse results from quantizing the DCT coefficients.  Lower resolution lets you turn up the CPU-usage knob on your codec while still being realtime, though.</p>

<p>For a test encode, I have a lossless source of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHVkegpW_ok"" rel=""nofollow"">sintel trailer</a>.  (3D animation with fades between scenes, and significant amount of changeless).  So it's probably actually a really bad test case...</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i sintel.y4m -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf crop=1920:816:0:132,scale=640:-1 -ssim 1 -psnr -tune animation -preset slow -b:v 270k 640x272.x264.270k.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>That does quite well, with an average QP of 18.03(I) / 23.44(P) / 24.93(B).  SSIM Mean Y:0.9852979, PSNR Global:44.801 at 231.37 kib/s.  (a still section at the end leaves x264 undershooting the target bitrate for one-pass).  I left psy optimizations enabled, so x264 is trying to do what looks best, not what scores highest on SSIM or PSNR.  Just useful as a ballpark figure.</p>

<p>I have a live-action source that's not too noisy.  I picked a portion that just has one actor moving around on stage, everyone else standing still, and no camera motion.  So it might be similar in compressibility to a someone talking while looking at a webcam, in front of a mostly-constant background.  (stuff like this matters a LOT for compressibility).  About 1/3 of the screen is black background.  (so black the encoder knows you can't see anything, and hardly spends any bits, I assume.)</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -ss 2410 -t 30 -i vid.yadif3.1,mcdeint3.1.10.ffvhuff.mkv -c:a opus -b:a 32k -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 30 -vf framestep=2 -ssim 1 -psnr  -preset slow -b:v 240k  2410+30.slow.opus.230k.mkv
</code></pre>

<p>Source is 60p deinterlace output, from NTSC DV or something.  Anyway, with those ffmpeg options, it stays as 720x480@30p (with non-square pixels, display aspect ratio = 16:9).  Output looks pretty darn good considering the bitrate, and the singing sounds good, but has some artifacts.  (audio source is not noisy, and there's no accompaniment, just soloist + chorus.)</p>

"Text fading in a clip in Shotcut","355","","<p>I make YouTube videos sometimes and Shotcut has always been my go-to for video editing, but I am working on a video now and can't figure out how to fade text in and out while a clip is playing. Help?</p>
","<p>It has been a long time since you asked the question. Maybe you have found your answer to your question in mean time. I am going to answer it anyway for you and for all others that are using this video editor.</p>

<p>I am using Shotcut in version 17.03.02.</p>

<p>There are probably more elegant and simple ways of doing this. The way I like to do it create a SVG file with the text I want (for example in Inkscape). I import this SVG into Shotcut and put in a separate video track above the main track and leave compositing enabled. Then I add fade-in and fade-out video filters to the SVG-Text video and enable the option ""Adjust opacity instead of fade with black"" for both filters. You can also adjust the duration of the filter/filters.</p>

<p>So to sum up:</p>

<ol>
<li>create <strong>svg</strong> file with your text</li>
<li>add a <strong>video track</strong> with the svg file </li>
<li>leave <strong>compositing on</strong></li>
<li>add <strong>fade-in/out filters</strong> and adjust duration</li>
<li><strong>check</strong> ""Adjust opacity instead of fade with black"" in both fade filters</li>
</ol>

<p>I am new in video editing, so any suggestion or even keyword will help.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>After Effects and masking are both total overkill for this problem.</p>

<p>First you want a video editor, not a complex VFX system, as your baseline.  If you have After Effects, you likely also have Premiere Pro.  Drag and drop each video onto a separate video layer.  In Premiere Pro, each video layer has an Effects tab that includes a Motion effect.  The Motion effect includes scaling and translating video (shifting it left/right or up/down).  Scale each video to 50% (they should all scale toward the middle of the screen), then translate each video to their respective corner.</p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is to crop the videos as you wish.  In Premiere Pro, there's a video effect in the Transitions category called Crop.  By cropping left, right, top, and bottom by a certain number of pixels, you will get the rectangle (or square) you want.</p>

<p>But almost any video editor at all has Layers, Scale, Translate, and Crop.  That's what you need to solve your problem.</p>

"Is 8k UHD or even 4k UHD actually necessary?","353","","<p>Hello I'm new to StackExchange so I apologize if I'm asking this in the wrong place.</p>

<p>My question though, at what point does the resolution of a tablet, monitor, television etc. make no difference to the human eye? Will the standards ever stop or will companies keep on milking our wallets forever (silly question really)?</p>
","<p>It all depends, of course, on what you are watching and where you are watching it. For instance, if you are showing something on a huge screen in a movie theater, you could definitely perceive a difference between 1080p and 4K. If you are looking at your phone, perhaps not as much. For standard computer monitor sizes, it's still fairly easy for many to see a difference at 4K, purely because we sit so damn close to our monitors.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that there are scenarios in which you need to <em>shoot</em> in 4K in order to <em>distribute</em> in 2K or 1080p. You may need to zoom into one part of your shot and crop most of it out, which you can get away with if the footage you shot was a higher resolution than what you need to output at. This also applies to any footage that you may need to stabilize (i.e. windy drone footage) since stabilization requires cropping your frame. So in these situations, we not only need cameras to shoot in 4K+, but also monitors and devices that can play them back in their full resolutions.</p>

<p>While there are certainly diminishing returns on ever-increasing resolution on small consumer devices, there are people who absolutely perceive the differences between 4K and lower resolutions. Up to 8K and beyond, I'm not so sure, but for the moment, we have not actually crossed that threshold.</p>

"If I can buy SSD, how do I best use it to improve video editing?","351","","<p>I am a small hobby editor. Just for fun, nothing serious. Hence: I don't know really much about the technical side at all, and most things I just don't understand. I'm really just a consumer.</p>

<p>I do have a good PC already: i7 4.00 Ghz, GTX 980.</p>

<p>I have 4 HDD's now, all 7200rpm: 1TB, 2TB, and 5TB(external). And one 500GB as primary containing my OS.</p>

<p>Now money restricts me a lot, so I can buy now ONE SSD and not even the greatest. I see an EVO of 500GB I can afford. </p>

<p>So how do I use that the best for video edit preformance?</p>

<p>I will have to keep all my source material on the HDD's. So I will import files from HDD into my Edit-program to edit.</p>

<p>I'm thinking to have my OS and all other programs on the SSD. But install only my Edit-program on the 2TB HDD and use that entire HDD ONLY for the Edit-program.</p>

<p>Or even the exact other way around: keep my OS and other on the HDD as it is, since I don't care much about fast boot or 'quickly open programs'. And install my Edit-program on the SSD and use the SSD only for that.</p>

<p>I searched google and internet for days trying to find a good answer for me, but I guess all other editors know too much to have such a low profile question lol.
I did find lots of editors claiming to have great benefit from SSD, but all of them had many SSD's so they could have their OS, Edit program AND their source material on SSD's. I can't possibly afford that now and I'm even wondering if one SSD will do me any good. If all the benefit I will get is that my Edit-software starts up really really fast, I wont bother...</p>

<p>Sorry for my rambling but I truly have no idea how I could make it work best. The ONLY reason I want to buy the SSD is to improve video editing, I have absolutely no other desire for it. </p>

<p>Any tips or advice I would highly appreciate!</p>

<p>ADDED: Maybe also useful info? My Edit-program is Cyberlink Powerdirector 15. I's very affordable and can still do nice things for it's price.
I mostly edit 1080p using quite a lot of multiple track splitscreens, multiple effects and transisions.
(Wow, I got 6 reputation and Bronze medal already? That wasn't hard lol :-)</p>
","<p>All computer performance optimization is based on understanding critical paths (bottlenecks), then removing or relaxing the bottleneck until there is nothing more you can afford to improve (possibly because there is simply no known widget, at any price, that will improve whatever else is on your critical path).</p>

<p>Some very common critical paths in video editing are</p>

<ol>
<li>Reading video data from disk</li>
<li>Rendering video data (for display and/or for writing to disk)</li>
<li>Writing video data to disk</li>
</ol>

<p>When you import video data into a project, rarely is it all loaded into RAM, though it could be.  If it is loaded into RAM, then buying an SSD is only going to speed up the initial loading of your RAM--a one-time benefit.</p>

<p>More often, video is buffered into RAM, but it fundamentally lives on disk, and thus disk speed becomes important as you play or scrub through your files.  If you have 1080p ACVHD stream, it uses approximately 28Mb/sec of bandwidth.  Modern HDDs can average 25MB/sec to 120MB/sec or more, depending on whether they are connected via USB2, USB3, USB3.1, SATA, eSATA, etc.  But if you need to load and display from 8 streams, it can try to read 28Mb/sec times 8 streams = 28MB/sec from the disk, but because the streams are likely scattered across the disk, it has to issue many seeks and buffer lots of data, leading to uneven performance.  An SSD is an advantage here because the seek time is virtually zero.  A single SATA SSD could easily handle 8 and perhaps 24 streams without choking.</p>

<p>However, the computer's CPU and GPU are typically designed to handle HD and perhaps quad HD video, meaning that they are going to begin to choke if they have to display 24 simultaneous streams.  But 4-8 should be OK.</p>

<p>To optimize your system, you should use a system profiling tool to see just how much disk bandwidth your system delivers under load vs. the calculated bandwidth of your video streams.  And you should measure how much video rendering performance your CPU/GPU can do vs. the estimated complexity of your streams (are they all just passed through a virtual switcher, or does every frame have scaling, translation, cropping, blur, sharpening, noise reduction, color correction, etc)?  You can then do some math: how much does it cost to close X% of the gap for each different gap you can measure.  Which dollars have the greatest impact on closing the gaps you can close?</p>

<p>You might find that indeed an SSD is just the ticket.  Or it might be that your GPU is really your rate-limiting step.  Most serious video editing workstations are a collection of many high-end components.  Having just one piece of the puzzle might only speed things up by 5%, whereas having all of the pieces, even if only half as good as the best, can speed things up by 50%.</p>

<p>It does take a little technical knowledge to profile and tune a system, but what it really takes is dedication to the process and good measurement tools.  Or enough money to keep buying bits until you can no longer see any improvements.</p>

"Canon 600d vs Sony PD170 for video production","348","","<p>If you were to develop a short film, which one of these two cameras would you use?
In a recent discussion with a friend he was claiming that a camera like the Canon 600d can produce videos of much better quality compared to a Sony PD170. Is he correct? Can somebody show me some evidence to support this (or the opposite)?</p>
","<p>It's a little bit subjective. DSLR footage, straight off the camera, is very crisp and clean. Whereas a PD170 has a bit more of a 'video' look. So first off you'd have to decide what kind of look you wanted to go for. </p>

<p>In most cases you would choose to shoot on a DSLR, simply because the image is more visually appealing. </p>

<p>Pros of DSLR:</p>

<ul>
<li>better looking footage (subjective, although a common view)</li>
<li>can attach a variety of lenses (i.e. fish-eye)</li>
<li>smaller body, more mobility</li>
<li>no need to import footage off a tape, just copy and paste off SD card onto computer</li>
<li>it's cheaper</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros of PD170:</p>

<ul>
<li>don't have to worry about the camera overheating (can shoot as long as the tape and/or batter allow. DSLRs tend to overheat after 10minutes of straight shooting)</li>
<li>larger body. Easier to do handheld with just the body alone</li>
<li>can plug in a microphone directly into the camera. This avoids having to use a clapper before each take and avoids the need of syncing audio and video</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, those are the main points. If you're looking to make a film cheaply, DSLR is the way to go. But don't forget about sound; good sound is integral to a film.</p>

<p>it appears that for each of them in playback (using mplayer and vlc) the first frame will be frozen for about 8 seconds while the audio starts from 00:00:00. So the audio remains about 8 seconds ahead of the video stream throughout.</p>

<p>When I try to convert them with FFmpeg, copying the video and audio codecs, I get a ton of ""buffer underflow"" and ""packet too large"" errors (which probably has to do with the codec etc. as per: <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/835871/how-to-make-an-mpeg2-video-file-with-the-highest-quality-possible-using-ffmpeg"">https://superuser.com/questions/835871/how-to-make-an-mpeg2-video-file-with-the-highest-quality-possible-using-ffmpeg</a>). If I convert it to another video and audio codec, it's fine - no buffer underflow/packet too large errors. But the audio remains out of sync with the video. </p>

<p>I have also tried passing the ffmpeg conversion <code>-itsoffset -8.0</code> to the input file and the audio is still out of sync, even though the video then does appear to advance from 00:00:00 in playback for the converted file. </p>

<p>Not sure if there is anything else I can do about this but I am wondering if it's possible to get this audio and video synced. I have also tried mencoder with <code>-mc 0</code>, <code>-noskip</code> and <code>-vf harddup</code> options and that actually syncs the video for the first portion, but then the audio and video fall out of sync after about 30 minutes or so in.</p>

<p><strong>Update - some input and output details:</strong></p>

","<p>You didn't specify if you want the first 8 seconds of Audio (it appears you do not) but you can split the input into separate Video and Audio files using ffmpeg (deMux).</p>

<p>Then with a second call to ffmpeg use ""-ss"" before the Audio's ""-i"" to chop off the first 8.07 seconds and use ""-copy"" to Mux them back  together (this is lossless).</p>

<p>Using ""-itsoffset"" before the ""-i"" of the Stream with ""-copy"" is another solution. Using ""-aresample"" can change the length of the Audio but you'll ruin Lipsync if it's a Video with people talking (as opposed to, for example, a Video with people walking down the street with traffic noise).</p>

"What types of cables support closed captioning?","347","","<p>For example, I know that HDMI cables explicitly do not send a CC signal to the TV, even if the source and TV both support it.</p>

<p>I assume that coax cable does support it since I can use a digital antenna and receive CC on my TV from digital over the air broadcasts (in the US).</p>

<p>Is there any other cabling that will carry the actual CC signal for the TV to decode?</p>

<p>I am currently sending a DVI signal to projectors in an auditorium and I am sending the same image by VGA over CAT5 to HDTVs in our lobby. We may need to add Closed Captioning to the lobby feed only so I do not want to change the image going to the projectors in the auditorium.</p>
","<p>Your question was initially confusing because you had focused on ""cables"" which is not the correct way of looking at this.</p>

<p>Once you've decoded a video signal to components, the <strong><em>closed</em></strong> captions are no longer available. If they were not inserted as <strong><em>open</em></strong> captions (aka subtitles) then they're simply not there.</p>

<p>So any transport that removes the Line 21 caption data or the digital caption packets eliminates your ability to defer captioning at the distant end -- you must insert the captions / subtitles before transport. That's the case with DVI / VGA / HDMI.</p>

<p>If you must allow the ability to choose a captioned or non-captioned display at the distant end, you would have to send two component feeds (e.g. two CAT5s), one captioned and one plain, and A/B switch them at that end.</p>

  <p>How to produce this no-shadow effect?</p>

<p>Some examples will explain this best.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2wwUA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
<sub>When close to a subject, the light rays from a large light source strike the subject from many angles. The closer the light is, the softer its shadows are.</sub></p>

<p>Images and captions from <em>Light – Science &amp; Magic: An Introduction to Photographic Lighting</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many lights do you think are required?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be done with one light, but it should be a large light source relative to the object. This doesn't mean the light itself was large, but the area the the light is being emitted from was large enough to cause scattered, soft light.</p>

<p>This is often done by placing diffuse material between the light source and the subject such as a soft box attached to the light, a diffusion panel from a cheap collapsible reflector, a light shed/tent that you can make yourself, or even some tissue paper (make sure it doesn't catch on fire). This results in a light quality similar to an overcast sky.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would some classical bulbs that I have at home work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know what a classical bulb is, but sure, you could possibly use typical household bulbs if they provide enough light for your camera and if you properly setup the scene. Don't forget to set the white balance. Use the same type of bulbs; don't mix types due to the potential differences in color temperature.</p>

"Trimming mp4 videos","345","","<p>I have a GoPro4 video, came out in mp4. If I try and trim in GoPro studio, not only have to jump through hoops but I then have to export - choose an encoding etc...itsends up being a .mov file (i assume for further editing) but  is larger than the original, even after being trimmed. If I compress I lose quality !!</p>

<p>Now if I use quicktime trim feature - it really does seem to trim it and leave it I'm its exact same format.</p>

<p>How is quicktime doing this? Why doesn't GoPro studio, nor iMovie, Nor Final CutPro X seem to be able to do a simple trim ???</p>
","<p>Cutting a video at a keyframe, without the slow and lossy process of decoding and re-encoding it, is only possible in the special case where you aren't applying any effects, overlays, rescaling, or anything.  And where you're happy with bitrate and decoder requirements of the input.  (e.g. h.264 High Profile, Level 4.0)</p>

<p>Perhaps fancier editting software thinks it's beneath them to detect that special case, and copy a subsection of the h.264 video and AAC audio bitstreams to a different file?  (in either the same or a different container format.  e.g. you could remux to mkv, or m2ts.)  Or maybe you just need to look in a menu somewhere to activate that special case.</p>

<p>Using ffmpeg, you can do what I think you're saying Quicktime's trim is doing:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -ss start_offset_seconds -t length_seconds -i input.mp4  -shortest -codec copy -movflags faststart trimmed.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>That runs about as fast as your hard drive can copy, since it's not re-encoding the video.  (codec = copy, not libx264).</p>

<p>To more directly answer your ""how is it doing this?"", google up remuxing.  ""mux"" (short for multiplex) is the term for putting multiple streams into a single output stream/file.  (1 video + 1 audio + 0 subtitles is the usual case.)</p>

"How do I do this Text animation in Sony Vegas (..or AE)?","343","","<p>Sometimes, when I have a look at music videos, I see lyric texts coming up. They are shaped in a rectangle, with different sized words. An example is this, which I made quickly.

<p>What is this effect called?</p>

<p>Let's say I have a music video. And I want to add lyrics to it, just like the example. How would I do this, animated, showing one by one in Sony Vegas Pro 13, or Adobe After Effects (Preferably Sony Vegas, I at used to the controls more)?</p>
","<p>It's called <a href=""http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/10-free-after-effects-templates-typography/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kinetic Type</a> generally (that link is for Templates). Depending on what you're looking to do you either need to do it manually or can use scripting to auto-fill a list of words. If you auto-fill with a list its generally more randomized, so if sequence is important. Like you want the Lyrics to appear in the order they're spoken you must do it manually.</p>

<p>You can use After Effects or Flash to create something like this.</p>

","<p>The video you showed is simply a stop motion video, not an animation.</p>

<p>So you aren't going to be able to simply send a jpg off somewhere and have it come back as a video.</p>

<p>There are plenty of video houses that will happily make you a video like this, but it is time consuming. Usually they video the entire process of drawing the art, then cut out frames - to ensure they keep in important key frames.</p>
