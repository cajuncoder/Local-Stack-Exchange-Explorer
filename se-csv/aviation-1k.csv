"What is the dark spot visible below the cockpit on A-10s?","134952","","<p>On most A-10s I have seen, the area under the cockpit is darker than the rest of the plane. Is there a reason for this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Q2HT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>It's a false cockpit, a type of camouflage <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US4448371"">patented in 1980</a> by Keith Ferris, a US artist and camouflage designer. From some angles, it makes it difficult to determine the orientation of the aircraft. The Canadians were the first to apply it; pictured is a CF-18 Hornet with one:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kls6Jm.jpg"" alt=""Canadian CF-18 Hornet, inverted, with false canopy.""></p>

<p>Notice how at a glance, it takes a second to realize the Hornet is inverted and pulling towards the ground. During dogfights this can be enough to make opposing pilots think the aircraft is going a different direction. It might not seem like much in a photo, or if you're watching an aircraft fly past at an air show or airport. In the stress of combat while pulling extra Gs it's more than enough to confuse or delay a reaction.</p>

<p>For the air to ground mission, this is particularly important. If an A-10 encountered antiaircraft fire or an enemy aircraft it would have to rely on its own agility to escape or gain the upper hand. Other nations have adopted this technique — I've seen French and Russian types, and possibly Gripens of some air force. As far as I know, the A-10 is the only US aircraft regularly camouflaged in this way.</p>

"What is the difference between a turbofan and a turboprop engine?","133351","","<p>I'm not an aircraft expert and I just realized that there are two different terms - turbofan and turboprop. I always had them combined in my head as a term for a large jet engine (like you would see on a 747). Apparently this is not the case though. So what is the difference between them? Are there other types of ""turbo"" engines?</p>
","<p>Both engines use a turbine for power. This is where the ""turbo"" part of the name comes from. In a turbine engine, air is compressed and then fuel is ignited in this compressed air. The energy produced by the ignition turns the turbine. The turbine is then able to drive both the compressor at the front of the engine and also some useful load. In airplanes, it produces thrust.</p>

<p>The first jet engine was a <strong>turbojet</strong>. This is a simple turbine engine that produces all of its thrust from the exhaust from the turbine section. However, because all of the air is passing through the whole turbine, all of it must burn fuel. This means it is inefficient, and the solution is the turbofan.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8BkMh.png"" alt=""Jet engine schematic""></p>

<hr>

<p>In a <strong>turbofan</strong>, the turbine primarily drives a fan at the front of the engine. Most engines drive the fan directly from the turbine. There are usually at least two separate shafts to allow the fan to spin slower than the inner core of the engine. The fan is surrounded by a cowl which guides the air to and from the fan. Part of the air enters the turbine section of the engine, and the rest is bypassed around the engine. In high-bypass engines, most of the air only goes through the fan and bypasses the rest of the engine and providing most of the thrust.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ryeeA.png"" alt=""Turbofan engine schematic""></p>

<hr>

<p>In a <strong>turboprop</strong>, the turbine primarily drives a propeller at the front of the engine. There is no cowl around the prop. Some air enters the turbine, the rest does not. The propeller is geared to allow it to spin slower than the turbine. Although this diagram shows only a single shaft, many turboprops have two, with a high pressure shaft driving the compressor and a low pressure shaft driving the propeller. Some engines such as the popular <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_Canada_PT6"">PT6</a> also reverse the flow direction multiple times.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hD8lr.png"" alt=""Turboprop engine schematic""></p>

<hr>

<p>Turboprops are more efficient at lower speeds since the prop can move much more air with a smaller turbine than the fan on a turbofan engine. The cowl around the turbofan's large fan allows it to perform better than an open propeller at high speeds, but limits the practical size of the fan.</p>

<p>At supersonic speeds, turbojets have more of a performance benefit. They develop all of their thrust from the high velocity turbine exhaust, while turbofans supplement that with the lower velocity air from the fan. Since the air from the fan is also not compressed nearly as much as the core turbine flow, it is also harder to prevent the flow from going supersonic and causing losses.</p>

<p>The Concorde used turbojets because it was designed to cruise for long periods at supersonic speeds. Modern fighter jet engines are turbofans, which provide a compromise between efficiency and speed.</p>

<p>There are other benefits and drawbacks between turbojets, turbofans, and turboprops, but I think they are beyond the scope of this question.</p>

<p>Work has been done on creating a ""propfan"" engine, in an attempt to get the efficiency of a turboprop and the speed of a turbofan. They have yet to come up with a viable design.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHaHH.jpg"" alt=""Prop fan engine schematic""></p>

<p>Elsewhere in aviation, turbine engines are used in </p>

<ul>
<li><p>helicopters, as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_Canada_PT6T"">turboshaft engine</a> driving the rotors instead of a propeller, and with a freewheeling clutch to enable autorotations</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit"">APU</a>s in jet aircraft and large turboprop aircraft</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Turbines also find use outside of aviation in power plants (to generate electricity), and even vehicles (like the Abrams tank).</p>

<p>Turbocharged piston engines use a turbine much differently from the examples above. Instead of being the primary power source, the turbine only assists the piston engine. A turbocharger uses a turbine to compress air sent to the engine intake. The increased compression helps the engine generate more power. The turbine of a turbocharger is driven by engine exhaust gasses, and a supercharger is similar but is directly powered by the engine. See the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"">Wikipedia page</a> for more detail.</p>

"What happens when an airplane stalls and why do pilots practice it?","103085","","<p>When a non-pilot hears the word stall, it brings to mind what happens when a car stalls -  the engine quits. It seems like that would be a dangerous scenario in an airplane. </p>

<p>From a non-pilot perspective, what happens when an airplane stalls and why is it important for pilots to practice it?</p>
","<p>Stall was an unfortunate choice of words for an engine that suddenly quits since the aerodynamic stall in aviation means something very different and isn't related to the aircraft engine at all<sup>1</sup>.  </p>

<p>To a non-pilot, an aerodynamic stall can best be described as the situation where there is not enough air flowing over the wings to create the amount of lift needed to hold up the airplane. </p>

<p>The main reason that student pilots practice stalls is to learn the telltale signs that occur just before it happens and to make the recovery procedure automatic.  If pilots can recognize an impending stall, they can take corrective action to either avoid the stall altogether or to recover as quickly as possible.  </p>

<p>Outside of training, inadvertent stalls typically only occur shortly before landing and after takeoff, when the pilot gets distracted while already at a slow speed.  In both of these situations the airplane is very close to the ground, immediately requiring the correct action from the pilot in order to avoid a crash.  This needs to be instinctive and corrected using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">muscle memory</a> so that it is accomplished as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The next logical question is usually:  <em>How does a pilot fix an airplane that has stalled?</em>  </p>

<p>Fortunately, airplanes are designed so that even during a stall the tail is still effective<sup>2</sup> and the pilot is able to use it to force the nose down.  This makes the airplane go faster, since it is pointed down towards the ground, and gets more air moving over the wing which allows it to create enough lift for the airplane to start flying again.  During practice it is usually pretty uneventful, but when it happens at a low altitude there may not be enough time to regain flying speed before the airplane crashes.</p>

<p>For more information, AOPA has a great Safety Publication targeting flight instructors called <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/inst_reports2.cfm?article=5318"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Why we teach slow flight and stalls</em></a> which is available on their website.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> However, the sail on a sailboat can also ""stall"" when there isn't enough wind and since they have been around since 3,000 BC I guess that technically this usage of the word applies to both situations.  </p>

<p><sup>2</sup> There are some stalls in particular airplane designs known as deep stalls that can be unrecoverable.  I don't think that this is important when describing it to a layperson though.</p>

"What is common number of flight hours a year for an airline pilot?","97353","","<p>Reading various reports including number of flight hours of the pilots I always wonder how it relates to years of service. In most professions, people work 40 hours a week, which gives around 1900 hours a year (assuming 4-5 weeks vacation as is usual in Europe). But pilots seem to have much fewer <em>flight</em> hours. I even read that in certain military operation the norm was 750 hours in a year. But that was difficult military operation and I haven't seen any number for common airline operations.</p>

<p>So how many flight hours is usual for full-time airline pilot to log in a year? And what does he do in the rest of his duty time? Or does he have less duty time than the usual 40 hours a week?</p>
","<p>Flight hours are limited to 30 hours in 7 days, 100 hours in a month and 1000 in a year.  Scheduling rules also say I need at least 1 day off a week, so 6 day trips are the max for me (121 US domestic scheduled).  </p>

<p>Let's look at a typical trip, which at my company tended to be a 4 day trip.  You want good productive trips, but you can't always get them.  On a 4 day trip let's say I have 6 hours of flight scheduled each day, or 24 hours scheduled that week.  I am getting paid the better of 24 hours or the actual flight time.  Now let's look at my duty day.  For a 6 hour day with 4 legs it was not unheard of to have a 12 hour duty day.  So now for a 4 day trip, I'm ""at work"" 48 hours and being paid for half of that.  Now consider that I'm not going home every night and my trip starts at 6 am on Friday and ends at midnight Monday night -- that totals to 90 hours away from home.</p>

<p>How does this compare to a 40 hour work week in an office?  In that case you are on duty 40 hours, getting paid 40 hours (or salary) and if you have a 1 hour commute one way, you are spending 50 hours away from home.</p>

<p>Back to the flight schedule.  A given month will have trips less productive than 24 hours and although you can probably build a 96 hour month if you tried, the average line of flying is typically going to be 75 hours of flying.  You can ballpark that will equate to 150 duty hours and 300 hours away from home for the month.  </p>

<p>Extrapolate that to a year, and you have 900 flight hours, 1800 duty hours and 3600 hours away from home.  I would say this represents the average US domestic 121 pilot.  Some do more, some do less, but this is pretty typical.</p>

<p>What do we do with all of that duty time that isn't flying?  Let's see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eating</li>
<li>Updating charts</li>
<li>Checking the weather</li>
<li>Checking the paperwork</li>
<li>Coordinating with gate agents, ramp agents, fuel agents to make sure we leave on time</li>
<li>Programming the FMS and getting our IFR clearance</li>
<li>Preflighting the airplane</li>
<li>Postflighting the airplane</li>
<li>Doing the weight and balance</li>
<li>Sleeping</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, that all of these activities require we are at the airport, in the secure area and we are not being paid.  The pay clock starts (roughly) when the airplane is buttoned up and the parking brake is released and ends when the parking brake is set and main cabin door opened.</p>

"What are the differences between Bearing vs Course vs Direction vs Heading vs Track?","93600","","<p><a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/a/54659/50720"">This answer</a> from English.SE does not focus on aviation, and does not explain 'Track'. </p>

<p>In basic, simple English, would you please compare and contrast all 5 terms in my question's title? The differences between 'course' vs 'heading' was generously explained <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/7998/128"">in this answer</a>.</p>
","<p>This is how I explain it, hopefully it helps more than hinders!</p>

<p><strong>Heading:</strong><br>
This is where my nose points - and seeing as my nose is attached to my head, this is where my head (and thus my machine) is pointing relative to North.</p>

<p><strong>Course:</strong><br>
This is my INTENDED path of travel that I have calculated taking into consideration winds, variation and declination.</p>

<p><strong>Track:</strong><br>
This is my ACTUAL path traveled over ground - just like a set of tracks I would leave behind in the snow or sand, relative to North </p>

<p><strong>Bearing:</strong><br>
This is the angle <em>between</em> the location of an object, machine or destination <em>and</em> either:<br>
- my heading. This is called 'Relative Bearing'.<br>
- or magnetic  north (direction toward the magnetic north pole). This is called 'Magnetic Bearing'.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Xqzo.jpg"" alt=""Diagram""></p>

<p>So from the picture, if I take off from Springfield enroute to Shelbyville. My <strong>course</strong> (the intended path) is due East, or 090 degrees. I notice my winds are Southerly (from 183 degrees / to 003 degrees), so I make my <strong>heading</strong> 095 degrees to compensate for wind drift (or 5 degrees crab into the wind).</p>

<p>If my calculations are bang on, my <strong>track</strong> should be the same as my <strong>course</strong>, however I misjudged the winds, finding out my resulting <strong>track</strong> over the ground is 081 degrees - I must correct (by increasing) my <strong>heading</strong> to get back on <strong>course</strong>.</p>

<p>Now with some airports, the navaids (NDB or VOR) are not directly at the airfield but some distance away, so if I wanted to either fly directly to the NDB or figure out my position in space during enroute nav checks, I would take the bearing to the NDB/VOR either relative to my <strong>heading</strong> or relative to magnetic north to find its position. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

"Can Microsoft Flight Simulator help me learn to fly (or make me a better pilot)?","89788","","<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator has ""flight lessons"" with a virtual flight instructor, some of which teach concepts that are taught during actual flight training.  These simulators are becoming <em>very</em> realistic, and I can see them being helpful as an introduction to a subject prior to running the hobbs meter and paying for actual flight time.  Will this experience help or hurt someone who decides to become a real pilot?  Is it a tool which can help students/instructors in an actual training environment? </p>
","<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/744/7691"">@Pondlife gave a very good answer</a>, and I'll add a few bits to that.</p>

<p>Even after having gotten my license, I still use Flight Sims (mainly Microsoft FSX and X-Plane 10) for some practice.</p>

<p>Before flying into an unfamiliar airport, or over an unfamiliar area, I'll often load it up in a simulator, and fly it.</p>

<p>Especially when I was a student, I found this incredibly helpful for my long cross country flights.   You can look at a map all you want, but its still not the same as sitting in the simulator, and looking around (<em>""I see the mountain on my left.... and the lake below me.  I can follow this valley all the way to the aiport...""</em> etc).   And I've generally found the simulator, with good terrain and textures loaded, can be pretty close to reality.   <p>The night before I did a student flight from <a href=""http://skyvector.com/?ll=46.61734816682296,-123.93806388012696&amp;chart=1&amp;zoom=6&amp;plan=A.K1.KBFI:G.47.43112208056429,-122.21923828336968:A.K1.KPLU:G.46.53801903196894,-122.4243164083625:G.45.966933325303984,-122.55703233623723:G.45.689467140542064,-122.72421092615514:A.K1.KVUO"" rel=""noreferrer"">KBFI to KVUO</a>, I flew the entire thing in FSX.   The next day, it really felt pretty much like making the same flight all over again.   Based on the landmarks, timing, views, etc, I knew exactly where I was, and I was confident that everything was going right.</p>

<hr>

<p>That said, in my opinion there are some things simulators do very poorly.<br>
Some of these are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Take offs</strong><br>The application of power and left-turning tendency on the ground just doesn't feel realistic at all.  The climb out doesn't feel right.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Landings</strong><br>Ground effect is difficult to observe in a simulator.  The flare doesn't feel like reality, and touching down (or bouncing) is not realistic at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross Control, Slip, Spin &amp; Unusual Attitudes</strong><br>Anything beyond basic maneuvers up to 30 degrees bank or 20 degrees climb doesn't match reality.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Because of these limitations, I would NOT use a flight simulator to try to learn Take Offs, Landings, or certain maneuvers.  (You can learn the ""procedure"" in a simulator... when to reduce power, when to add flaps.  But the ""feel"" will be all wrong).</p>

<hr>

<p>If you're going to try to incorporate Flight Sim into your training, there are some basic things you should do:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Spend LOTS of time configuring it</strong><br>Unlike a video-game, this is not ""plug-n-play"".  Spend time learning <em>all</em> the controls.</li>
<li><strong>Turn on Realism</strong><br>When adjusting your controls, set all ""null-zones"" to zero, set ""Sensitivity"" to maximum, turn off helpers like ""auto-mixture"" and ""auto-rudder"", etc.  (However, I do keep ""Gyro-Drift"" turned off in my sim.  Its annoying, and adds little practical value)</li>
<li><strong>Turn on Weather</strong><br>The flight simulators typically come pre-setup with zero wind, good weather, standard temperature, etc.   Configure yours to pull from real-world weather sources, or add some clouds, a variety of winds, and don't always fly at noon.  Set the timing for early morning flights, twilight flights, night flights, etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Another ""fun"" area where Flight Simulators can be slightly helpful is in Emergency Procedures.<p>Typically in real-world training, my instructor told me:  ""We're going to practice engine-out emergencies"" and my mind immediately starts preparing for that... And naturally, we have to do them at a safe altitude in a safe area.</p>

<p>In a flight simulator, you can set up the computer to give you a random emergency at a random time.   You might get the problem on short-final, or over a metro-downtown area.  Something that you just <em>can't</em> do in reality.</p>

<p>I haven't had any real-life emergencies, so I don't know how accurate flight simulator is.  But I believe that <em>some practice</em> is better than no practice at all, and flight sim lets me fly into storms, icing, get lost in fog, fly approaches below minimums, have an engine seize up on me, etc, all without risking my butt or a $200,000 airframe.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Since @Lnafziger suggested more specifically addressing flight training:</em></p>

<p>I do believe that Flight Sim can help with certain aspects of training, but in other areas, it is no help at all, or actually harmful.</p>

<p><strong>Training Areas simulators can help with:</strong><p></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Procedures</strong><br>Reviewing steps and procedures <em>before</em> going in the air.  For example, for a student, steep turns or stall recovery can be a little nerve wracking at first.  It may be much easier (and cheaper) to do it in a sim with an instructor, discussing all the steps and reasons for actions.  Then when the student gets in the air, they won't have the ""feel"" for it, but at least the general process is already familiar.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navigation</strong><br>Tuning and identifying VORs, and interpreting the needles can be done just as well be done on the ground as in the air.  If the sim has good, realistic terrain (I prefer <a href=""http://www.megascenery.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">MegaSceneryEarth</a>), it can also be used for some visual reference lessons.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instrument interpretation</strong><br>Scanning and cross-checking the 6-pack of instruments can be done in a simulator just fine, and a student can practice doing it for long periods of time for a fraction of the cost of flight-time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Training Areas simulators are very bad at:</strong><p></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>On the ground &amp; Outside the plane</strong><br>Anything on the ground, such as taxiing and parking, or anything outside the airplane, such as pre-flight inspection, or weather interpretation, just doesn't work in a sim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Radios</strong><br>I haven't seen any flight sims that really work for the practice of talking on or listening to the radios.  (I haven't used VATSim, which <em>might</em> help).  I don't think there's any good substitute for actually flying in a real airspace while simultaneously engaging in real radio conversations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feel</strong><br>Even the best full-motion sim isn't a substitute for the forces a student feels in a real airplane.  This is especially true on ground-reference maneuvers, takeoffs, and landings, where I feel sims fall far short of reality.  No one will ever get a ""feel"" for the plane from a simulator.</p></li>
</ul>

"When to use Beacon, Anti Collision, Strobe, Logo and Navigation lights?","84564","","<p>During taxi, the taxi-light are used, and I think the landing lights are required to be used up to 10.000 feet for all commercial flights.</p>

<p>However, my question is regarding the above mentioned lights: Beacon, Anti Collision, Strobe, Logo and Navigation lights. When are they to be used, and when should they not be used? What is the meaning and purpose of each one?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/aim_basic_4-03-14.pdf"">Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)</a> is a great place to look for questions like this, and has this on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>4-3-23. Use of Aircraft Lights</strong></p>
  
  <p>a. Aircraft position lights are required to be lighted on aircraft
  operated on the surface and in flight from sunset to sunrise. In
  addition, aircraft equipped with an anti-collision light system are
  required to operate that light system during all types of operations
  (day and night). However, during any adverse meteorological
  conditions, the pilot-in-command may determine that the anti-collision
  lights should be turned off when their light output would constitute a
  hazard to safety (14 CFR Section 91.209). Supplementary strobe lights
  should be turned off on the ground when they adversely affect ground
  personnel or other pilots, and in flight when there are adverse
  reflection from clouds.</p>
  
  <p>b. An aircraft anti-collision light system can use one or more
  rotating beacons and/or strobe lights, be colored either red or white,
  and have different (higher than minimum) intensities when compared to
  other aircraft. Many aircraft have both a rotating beacon and a strobe
  light system.</p>
  
  <p>c. The FAA has a voluntary pilot safety program, Operation Lights On,
  to enhance the see-and-avoid concept. Pilots are encouraged to turn on
  their landing lights during takeoff; i.e., either after takeoff
  clearance has been received or when beginning takeoff roll. Pilots are
  further encouraged to turn on their landing lights when operating
  below 10,000 feet, day or night, especially when operating within 10
  miles of any airport, or in conditions of reduced visibility and in
  areas where flocks of birds may be expected, i.e., coastal areas, lake
  areas, around refuse dumps, etc. Although turning on aircraft lights
  does enhance the see-and-avoid concept, pilots should not become
  complacent about keeping a sharp lookout for other aircraft. Not all
  aircraft are equipped with lights and some pilots may not have their
  lights turned on. Aircraft manufacturer's recommendations for
  operation of landing lights and electrical systems should be observed.</p>
  
  <p>d. Prop and jet blast forces generated by large aircraft have
  overturned or damaged several smaller aircraft taxiing behind them. To
  avoid similar results, and in the interest of preventing upsets and
  injuries to ground personnel from such forces, the FAA recommends that
  air carriers and commercial operators turn on their rotating beacons
  anytime their aircraft engines are in operation. General aviation
  pilots using rotating beacon equipped aircraft are also encouraged to
  participate in this program which is designed to alert others to the
  potential hazard. Since this is a voluntary program, exercise caution
  and do not rely solely on the rotating beacon as an indication that
  aircraft engines are in operation.</p>
  
  <p>e. Prior to commencing taxi, it is recommended to turn on navigation,
  position, anti­collision, and logo lights (if equipped). To signal
  intent to other pilots, consider turning on the taxi light when the
  aircraft is moving or intending to move on the ground, and turning it
  off when stopped or yielding to other ground traffic. Strobe lights
  should not be illuminated during taxi if they will adversely affect
  the vision of other pilots or ground personnel.</p>
  
  <p>f. At the discretion of the pilot­in­command, all exterior lights
  should be illuminated when taxiing on or across any runway. This
  increases the conspicuousness of the aircraft to controllers and other
  pilots approaching to land, taxiing, or crossing the runway. Pilots
  should comply with any equipment operating limitations and consider
  the effects of landing and strobe lights on other aircraft in their
  vicinity.</p>
  
  <p>g. When entering the departure runway for takeoff or to “line up and
  wait,” all lights, except for landing lights, should be illuminated to
  make the aircraft conspicuous to ATC and other aircraft on approach.
  Landing lights should be turned on when takeoff clearance is received
  or when commencing takeoff roll at an airport without an operating
  control tower.</p>

"What are the advantages of squawking 7700?","81593","","<p>I was reading this <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2163/how-do-commercial-pilots-send-distress-signals"">question</a> about how do pilots send distress signals in emergency scenarios, and that got me thinking...</p>

<p>In voretaq7's answer, he states that there are three ways to send distress signals, one of them is by the aircraft's transponder</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three transponder codes are reserved for unusual/emergency situations:<br>
   - <code>7700</code> for general emergencies.<br>
   - <code>7600</code> for loss of communication    (radio failure).<br>
   -  <code>7500</code> for hijacking or other unlawful    interference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can understand the reason to squawk both <code>7500</code> and <code>7600</code> in the appropriate situation, but I'm failing to understand why squawk <code>7700</code> in an emergency scenario.</p>

<p>So that's what I'm thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In case of a hijack, the ability to squawk <code>7500</code> to silent alert the ATC of the situation, without the hijacker knowing, <strong>is an advantage</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>In case of a radio failure, where you can't alert the ATC over the radio, the ability to squawk <code>7600</code> and make them aware of your situation, <strong>is an advantage</strong>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Is it common for pilots to squawk <code>7700</code> in emergency scenarios?</li>
<li>What are the advantages, for the pilots, to squawk <code>7700</code> in emergencies situations?</li>

","<p>If you make a radio call, unless you are on 121.5 (or 243 military), then only the station you are talking to will initially know about the emergency. Initial calls should always be with the unit you are working with unless you are VFR.</p>

<p>If you squawk 7700, then all stations in transponder range, including possible airborne stations such as AWACS and SAR will know right away that you are in trouble, with position, altitude and possibly aircraft type and flight number.</p>

<p>If VFR, you might not be talking to anyone and may not have the frequencies of nearby units easily to hand.</p>

<p>Squawking 7700 is definitely a good thing.</p>

<p>You mentioned being busy.  The mantra drilled into everyone is ""aviate, navigate, communicate"".  In most circumstances, fly the plane, fly it where you want it to go, then tell someone about it.  Squawking 7700 will be one of the last actions carried out.</p>

"How dangerous is flying in a single-engine plane?","73569","","<p>Some people consider flying small planes very dangerous. Just how dangerous is it to fly in a light single-engine plane? For example, how does the fatality rate compare to driving a car, riding a motorcycle, etc.?</p>
","<p>I get this question a lot from people who are apprehensive about flying with a private pilot.  I'm afraid I won't be reducing these fears in any way.  Let's review some general statistics during 2008.  Note - these stats aren't specific to light or single engine aircraft:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://apps.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_02_14.html"">NTSB</a> reported there were 1.21 fatalities per 100,000 flight hours for private aircraft (Part 91 operators).  </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/main/index.aspx"">NHTSA</a> reported there were 1.26 fatalities per 100 million miles travelled by automobile</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can equate that to about 2 million hours (estimating an average speed of 50mph). This gives us 0.063 fatalities per 100,000 driving hours.</p>

<p>Private aircraft have a fatality rate about 19 times greater than driving.  It is also true that a majority of the accidents that occur are pilot error (71%) and could have been prevented. </p>

<p>There are risks involved when taking to the sky as a private pilot and understanding these risks is part of the continual learning process.  The key to safety is performing careful planning, keeping current and proficient, knowing when to cancel flights or turn around and not to exceed your capabilities or the capabilities of your aircraft.  </p>

"Why do jet engines use kerosene rather than gasoline?","72502","","<p>Could you run a jet with gasoline? Why do all jet engines use kerosene?</p>
","<p>You can persuade a turbine engine to run on just about anything that can burn. So the decision of which fuel to actually use depends on the side factors including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>availability</li>
<li>cost</li>
<li>emissions</li>
<li>hot section temperature</li>
<li>chemical reactions with engine parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coal dust is rather difficult to pump around, and the rampies don't like shovelling</li>
<li>liquid hydrogen (used in the Space Shuttle) requires a lot of storage and has the nasty habit of freezing anything it touches, like rampies.</li>
<li>ethylacetylenedecaborane is unpleasantly toxic (rampies union again) and the combustion byproducts were rather abrasive to the engine's innards</li>
<li>trimethylaluminum would reduce the engine complexity (no igniters needed) because it has the nasty habit of igniting instantly upon contact with air, so leaks are rather dangerous.</li>
<li>natural gas is commonly used as a turbine fuel in pumping stations: it's already there and thus is ""free"". The required pressure vessels make it impractical to use as an aircraft fuel.</li>
</ul>

<p>So kerosene basically became the standard turbine fuel because it's:</p>

<ul>
<li>cheap: kerosene makes up a rather large fraction of crude oil. When you measure your fuel load in tons a few cents per litre makes a difference.</li>
<li>safe to handle: relatively non-toxic, doesn't ignite all that easily</li>
<li>storable and transportable in common structural metals</li>
<li>doesn't clog up the engine</li>

<p>Does that mean that there was no Air Marshal on board (or one of them was?).</p>

<p>Aren't air marshals present on every flight?</p>
","<p>The exact number of air marshals is not public information, and they certainly don't disclose what flights they fly on or other operational details. However, the number <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/25/us/air-marshals-cut/"">has been reported</a> to be on the order of ~3,000-4,000 and reports indicate the number has decreased somewhat since then. All of them are, of course, not on duty 24/7/365. There are around <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CSoyXSzfPawJ:sos.noaa.gov/Datasets/dataset.php%3Fid%3D44%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us"">87,000 flights</a> a day in the US alone, but only around 28,000 are commercial passenger flights, where air marshals are presumably most likely (hopefully there's not a need for air marshals on military flights, for instance). </p>

<p>So for some back of the envelope math, let's conservatively say there are 3,500 air marshals who all work five days a week, they all work alone (in reality, they appear to work at least in pairs), and they somehow manage to average protecting four flights a day. Even with these conservative assumptions, that would only be 5000 flights/day covered by air marshals. From this, it should be clear that there cannot possibly be an air marshal on every commercial flight in the US. </p>

<p>The President of the Air Marshal Association/CWA (their union), not entirely a disinterested party, <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2014/08/07/5-myths-about-air-marshals/13724331/"">agrees</a>:</p>

""If you were to attempt to place a team of just two FAMs on each flight, it would require an agency of over 75,000 FAMs (accounting for training and days off). FAMs cover a very small percentage of commercial flights.""</p>
  
  <p>Which flight air marshals get on is determined by a computer program that assesses the probability of threat based on the aircraft, departure and destination cities, as well as the amount of fuel on board. This is the threat matrix that comes out of the missions operation center.</p>
  
  <p>The TSA will not release statistics on the number of air marshals. TSA's Pascarella acknowledges only ""many thousands."" But Biles estimates that there are approximately 3,300 FAMs and of those, 34% are filling ground assignments in training, operations and management.</p>
  
  <p>""We call them 'chair marshals,' riding out their career in management,"" says Biles. That leaves 66% of the workforce to perform in-flight security duties.</p>
  
  <p>""If one accounts for vacations, sick leave, medical leave and days off, some air marshals working in operations have told me that this accounts for less than one half percent of all U.S.-flagged aircraft being covered by federal air marshals,"" he says.</p>

<p>I've never fully understood what N1 and N2 are on engine instruments and how they relate to thrust and the position of the throttle.</p>
","<p>Conceptually, N1 is the fan (or, fan <em>speed</em>) and is most related to your thrust (since the fan produces more thrust than the core on today's big motors). The N2 is the engine core, and the N2 gauge is used mainly during engine start: on initial starter engagement, the N2 starts turning first, and things like adding fuel+ignition and then later disengaging the starter are based on specified N2 speeds. As long as you have N1 rotation before lighting the engine off, N1 isn't all that important during the start. But once it is running, power is generally set with reference to the N1 (or fuel flow or EGT or EPR) rather than the N2.</p>

<p>Why are/were magnetic headings used in aviation?</p>
","<p>The ""heading"" refers to the direction an aircraft is pointing. For a Magnetic Heading, this is in relation to Magnetic North. For a True Heading, this is in relation to True North.</p>

<p><strong>True North</strong> is directly over the earth's axis.</p>

<p><strong>Magnetic North</strong> is somewhere over Canada, moving towards Russia.</p>

<hr>

<p>To get the <strong>Magnetic Heading</strong>, you just read it off the magnetic compass.</p>

<p>To get the <strong>True Heading</strong>, you need to first read the magnetic compass, then either add an Easterly, or subtract a Westerly, magnetic variation; based upon the isogonic lines on your sectional (the purple dashed lines labeled 5°W, 3°E, etc).  </p>

<p>Because of this, in the past, magnetic headings were used because a simple compass could be used. Finding reliable true headings was difficult until the era of things like the gyrocompass (patented in 1906 (Germany) and 1908 (USA)) and more recently, GPS.</p>

"Why do jet engines get better fuel efficiency at high altitudes?","59435","","<p>I'm told that this is true, but I can't imagine why.  It seems like the fact that there is less air would make the engines less efficient...  But that probably just shows how little I know about jet engines.</p>
","<p>For a quick explanation you need to know that</p>

<ul>
<li>Thrust is the difference between the entry impulse of the air entering the engine and the exit impulse of the heated fuel-air mixture leaving the engine. Impulse is mass times velocity, and expressed with a mass flow $\dot m$, thrust T is $$T = \dot m \cdot (v_{exit} - v_{entry})$$</li>
<li>The exit impulse is increased by accelerating the airflow through the engine, and the acceleration is achieved by heating the air.</li>
<li>Each gram of fuel heats up a given mass of air by a certain number of centigrades. The definition of the energy content of fuels is given as the capacity to <a href=""http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/British-thermal-unit-Btu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit</a>. The definition of one <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Calorie</a> is similar, but in metric units. Since the heat capacity of both water and air are almost constant at moderate temperatures, the starting temperature makes little difference to the absolute temperature increase when a given amount of energy is added.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thermal efficiency</h2>

<p>Thermal efficiency is the ratio between the mechanical work extracted as thrust and the heat energy spent on heating the air, and it is affected indirectly by the flight altitude. Please see the Wikipedia article on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carnot cycle</a>. This and similar cycles describe the workings of all combustion engines in thermodynamic terms. Basically, it says that the efficiency of a combustion engine cannot be greater than the temperature ratio between the temperature increase from  ambient ($t_{amb}$) to the maximum temperature $t_{max}$ of the process, divided by the maximum temperature. All temperatures must be expressed as total temperatures, where 0° means 0&nbsp;K or -273.15°C. Operating in colder air makes the ratio bigger and improves efficiency.
$$\eta_t = \frac{t_{max} - t_{amb}}{t_{max}} $$
<p>
If $t_{amb}$ is 290&nbsp;K (16.85°C or 62°F) and the fuel heats up the air to 1400&nbsp;K (2060°F), the thermal efficiency according to the formula above is 79.3%.</p>

<p>At cruise altitude $t_{amb}$ is only 220&nbsp;K (-53.15°C or -63.7°F), and the same fuel flow relative to air flow will lift the maximum temperature only to 1320&nbsp;K (in reality even less; for a more precise reasoning see below). Now the thermal efficiency is 83.33%! If the maximum temperature is maintained, both thrust and thermal efficiency will go up; the latter to 84.3%.</p>

<p>In reality the total efficiency will be lower because we have not included <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7910/why-is-a-higher-bypass-ratio-more-efficient-at-lower-speeds"">propulsive efficiency</a>, friction effects or power offtake by bleed air, pumps and generators. Propulsive efficiency describes <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8819/is-there-any-equation-to-bind-velocity-thrust-and-power/8822#8822"">how well the acceleration of air</a> is performed.</p>

<h2>Heating the fuel-air mixture</h2>

<p>Burning a fuel-air mixture will add thermal energy to it, about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene#Properties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">43&nbsp;MJ for every kilogram of kerosene</a> (if we assume complete combustion). The isobaric <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heat capacity</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">specific heat of air</a> (close enough, the mixture has very little fuel but lots of air in it) is 29&nbsp;J per mol and per K, so those 43&nbsp;MJ will heat 1000&nbsp;mol of air by 1483&nbsp;K. The heat capacity changes slightly with humidity and temperature, but litte enough that we can consider it constant for this purpose. If the air starts at 220&nbsp;K, precompression in the intake will heat it to approx. 232&nbsp;K, further compression in the engine will heat it up to approx. 600&nbsp;K if we assume a compression ratio of 25, and this is the temperature at the entry of the combustion chamber.</p>

<p>Those <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=mass%20of%201000%20mol%20of%20air"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1000&nbsp;mol of air weigh about 29&nbsp;kg</a>, and adding a full kilo of fuel and burning the mixture will heat it to 2083&nbsp;K. If you want more details about the parameters in a typical jet engine, please see the diagram in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11481/why-are-turbine-blades-not-made-out-of-titanium-only-compressor-blades/11483#11483"">this answer</a>. Since the mixture picks up speed as it burns, the fuel mass is also heated and combustion is never complete, the maximum temperature given here will not be reached in reality.</p>

<p>If we start on the ground with an air temperature of 290&nbsp;K, the temperature in the intake would drop slightly because we will not be flying fast enough for any precompression to happen in the intake. Now the compressor will heat the air to 730&nbsp;K, and again adding and burning that kilo of kerosene will heat 1000&nbsp;mol of air to 2213&nbsp;K. Ideally.</p>

<p>In reality, the engine control will see that the limit temperatures are not exceeded, but here we can play with the numbers as we like. The exact values will certainly be slightly different (more frictional heating in the compressor, heat loss to the outside, slight drift in specific heat with temperature), but the gist of the explanation is correct.</p>

<h2>Explanation in layman's terms</h2>

<p>Burning the fuel-air mixture heats it and makes the gas expand. This happens at nearly constant pressure and in a restricted volume, so the only way to make room for this expansion is for the gas to flow faster. Nearly constant pressure  means that the density of the gas must decrease. The density ratio between the heated and the unburnt gas is proportional to its <strong>temperature ratio</strong>, measured in absolute temperature.</p>

<p>However, the amount of fuel burnt determines the <strong>absolute</strong> temperature increase, the <strong>difference</strong> in degrees between the burnt gas inside the combustion chamber and the unburnt gas at the intake. For a given amount of fuel, the <strong>temperature ratio</strong> which can be achieved with an absolute temperature increase becomes smaller the higher the temperature of the unburnt gas is. Thus, efficiency decreases with higher temperature of the intake air.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xz3sD.jpg"" alt=""commercial jet img""></p>

<p>How about military planes? They get really close when in formations... Is there a minimum distance?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jd5j2.gif"" alt=""Military formation img""> </p>
","<p>The question specifically asks about FAA regulations, so I will try to provide specific citations.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For a commercial airliner (as the question asked), separation will <em>usually</em> be at least <strong>3 miles laterally</strong>, <em>or</em> <strong>1,000 feet vertically</strong>. In the enroute environment -- at higher operating speeds above 10,000 feet and based on the type of Radar and distance from the antennae -- a <strong>5 mile</strong> rule is applied laterally. This is true in <em>most but not all</em> situations. There are exceptions: see below.</p>

<p>Note also the ""or"": it is allowed (and in fact rather common) for two jets to cross paths at the same moment, with one 1,000 feet directly above the other. The 3 miles is only required if the jets do not have at least 1,000 feet of vertical separation.</p>

<h2>Pilots</h2>

<p>The regulations do not set a specific distance that pilots flying under VFR must maintain from each other. There's just the following blanket statement:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d2302efbd7d0368b9999a00eba1d3f0a&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10.2.4.6&amp;rgn=div8"">§91.111, Operating near other aircraft</a>: (a) No person may operate an aircraft so close to another aircraft as to create a collision hazard. (b) No person may operate an aircraft in formation flight except by arrangement with the pilot in command of each aircraft in the formation.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the catch-all ""careless or reckless operation"" clause:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d2302efbd7d0368b9999a00eba1d3f0a&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10.1.4.7&amp;rgn=div8"">§91.13, Careless or reckless operation</a>: No person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another.</p>

<p>Pilots flying under IFR are subject to the same kinds of rules, and are still responsible for maintaining separation from other traffic when in visual conditions. The rules are the same: the pilot is given the discretion of deciding what a ""safe distance"" is.</p>

<p>Actual distance limits only come into play for the air traffic controllers, who are responsible for providing minimum separation distances between IFR traffic.</p>

<h2>Air Traffic Controllers</h2>

<p>The set of FAA regulations for air traffic controllers is <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/index.htm"">FAA order 7110.65</a>. These regulations are quite complicated and there are lots of exceptions and corner cases for various scenario. I'll try to give only the most basic rules here, but note that a full reading of 7110.65 would be necessary to understand all the minutiae.</p>

<p>Vertical separation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0405.html#atc0405.html.1"">4-5-1 Vertical Separation Minima</a>. In general, 1,000 feet for IFR traffic (with exceptions).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0707.html#3oJ190JACK"">7-7-3 Separation</a>, <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0708.html#MpJ186JACK"">7-8-3 Separation</a>, <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0709.html#rpJ398JACK"">7-9-4 Separation</a>. 500 feet for VFR aircraft (with exceptions).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lateral separation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0505.html#PiK190JACK"">5-5-4 Minima</a>. In general, 3 miles in the terminal environment and 5 miles in the enroute environment (with exceptions).</li>
</ul>

<p>Things get more complicated in the following scenarios, and exceptions apply to them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oceanic environment (<a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/TOC.html#Chapter%C2%A08.%20Offshore/Oceanic%20Procedures"">7110.65 Chapter 8</a>).</li>
<li>Approach environment, especially at large/busy airports with parallel runways and special approach monitoring radar. (<a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/TOC.html#Chapter%C2%A03.%20Airport%20Traffic%20Control-%20Terminal"">7110.65 Chapter 3, Sections 9 &amp; 10</a>).</li>
<li>Nonradar environment (anytime the controller is not able to ""apply radar separation"") (<a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/TOC.html#Chapter%C2%A06.%20Nonradar"">7110.65 Chapter 6</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>For these scenarios the regulations are rather lengthy and complicated, so I would simply refer you to Order 7110.65 in general.</p>

<h2>Military</h2>

<p>When flying in airspace controlled by ATC, military pilots must follow the same rules as civilian aircraft. ATC will keep them separated according to the rules above. However, there are two main exceptions to this.</p>

<p>When flying in formation, such as for training, aerial refueling, or intercepting aircraft, they are much too close for ATC to provide safety. In these cases, ATC will allow the pilots to fly under MARSA (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARSA_%28aviation%29"">Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft</a>). In the case of interception, if the fighter pilot is not able to see the aircraft they are intercepting before the minimum separation, they must break off. They can only fly under MARSA if they can actually ensure visual separation.</p>

<p>The FAA can also define an MOA (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operations_area"">Military Operations Area</a>). Once military aircraft enter this area, ATC is no longer responsible for them and they are under MARSA. When the aircraft leave the MOA, ATC resumes control. They can still be under MARSA for a formation, but ATC will keep that formation separated from other traffic.</p>

<p>In tactical formation flying, there is no limit. The <a href=""http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/"">Blue Angels</a> routinely fly with <a href=""http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx"">only 18"" separation between the wing tip and the cockpit canopy</a>. Combat aircraft fly a variety of different formation patterns at varying distances, and pilots are extensively trained on each pattern and what the appropriate/safe distances are. (For example, a fingertip formation allows for much closer flying than a line-abreast formation.)</p>

<p>Traveling in the opposite direction from B to A you'd have a tailwind, and with the same 500 knot airspeed you would make the trip in roughly 4 hours.</p>

A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737"">Boeing 737-400</a> seats about 150, has a maximum range of about 2,400 miles, and a cruising speed of about 473 knots (almost double the range, and over 1.5 times the speed). But its burn rate is about 3,000 liters per hour (793 gallons).</p>

<p>So is it a strict trade-off? Speed for Efficiency? Well, not entirely.</p>

<p>TAS is <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_airspeed"">true airspeed</a></em>. That is, <code>the speed of the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying</code>. However, an <em>decrease in density</em> (e.g. high altitudes; air is less dense) will yield an <em>increase in TAS</em>. Thus, it is easier to fly at the same <em>true airspeed</em> at higher altitudes. Since jets are generally used on longer flights (where much of the time in the air is spent at high cruise altitude), they have to work less to fly the same speed as they would 10,000 feet below. There are other reasons why jets are more efficient at high altitudes - they have to combine less fuel with the thinner air, and there is less drag at high altitudes.</p>

<p>So why don't propeller planes fly at high altitudes then? Well, part of it is that turboprops are <em>less efficient</em> at higher speeds <strong>and</strong> higher altitudes, and jets (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan"">turbofans</a>) are <em>more efficient</em> at both (obviously to a point, but airliners don't fly fast or high enough to decrease their efficiency again).</p>

<p>Since jet engines can also produce more thrust, they are better suited to large airplanes, which are the ones used for <em>long distances</em> (e.g. if you wanted a propeller plane the size of an Airbus A380, you would need a lot more than 4 engines). So jets are used in situations where they are more economical, and props where they are more economical.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>Turboprop characteristics</p>

<ul>
<li>Efficient at low speed, low altitude</li>
<li>Low thrust</li>
</ul>

<p>This leads to smaller aircraft on shorter, slower routes, like you've observed, since they don't <em>have to</em> climb or fly fast to get there in a reasonable amount of time. Also these short hops generally require <em>fewer passengers</em>, or flying a second flight is better than needing a much bigger plane.</p>

<p>Turbofan characteristics</p>

<ul>
<li>Efficient at high speed, high altitude</li>
<li>High thrust</li>
</ul>

<p>This leads to larger aircraft on longer, faster routes, like you've observed, since they <em>need</em> to fly higher and faster to get there in a reasonable amount of time. Also since these routes are more ""popular"", and it costs so much to fly that far, it makes more sense to put more passengers on one plane, than two.</p>

<p>In general, an airline would <em>not</em> sacrifice fuel for faster flights <em>if that was the only advantage</em>, unless they knew there could be a price premium for the faster flight (e.g. Concorde).</p>

"How are runways numbered?","56644","","<p>I'm not a professional pilot, just an enthusiast, so this might seem obvious to others; but I noticed that airports don't use sequential numbering for runways, starting from 1.</p>

<p>Liverpool (for example) has runway 9/27; so how are these numbers assigned? Also, what do Left and Right signify?</p>
","<p>Runways are usually numbered according to their direction, more precisely called runway magnetic bearing or QFU (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code"">see Q codes</a>).</p>

<p>Consider a plane flying toward the runway on final approach in a day without any wind. Divide its magnetic heading by 10, round it to the nearest whole number and you'll usually get the runway number. For example, if the magnetic heading is 345° then 345/10=34,5, so the runway number will be 35 which will be a runway used for landings (and takeoffs) to the north.</p>

<p>Opposite ends of the same runway have different numbers, 18 (which represents 180 degrees) apart. A runway with 35  for landings to the north will have runway 17 for landings to the south. Even though these are the same strip of concrete, they are treated as separate runways by pilots and controllers.</p>

<p>If there are two airports near one another with runways at the same angle, sometimes one of the airports will add or subtract one from the runway number to help planes differentiate between the airports.</p>

<p>Occasionally a runway number will change when the magnetic declination angle changes in such amount, making the runway magnetic bearing divided by 10 and rounded to the nearest whole number increase or decrease.</p>

<p>Some runways in areas of large magnetic declination use true instead of magnetic headings for the runway numbers. This is not unusual in northern Canada and Greenland.</p>

<p>When there is more than one parallel runway at an airport, L, R, or C may be appended to the runway number for Left, Right, or Center. These are based on the approach direction, so, for example, the runway 35L would be called 17R from the opposite direction.</p>

","<p><strong>White has some significant thermal advantages over color.</strong> In most cases, this is probably just a benefit in terms of keeping the cabin slightly cooler. In the case of 'plastic' airplanes (those built with composite construction), some airframes <em>require</em> the use of white paint on upper surfaces to keep some elements within limits. <a href=""http://www.diamondaircraft.com/library/19/10/Temperature_limitation.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Early Diamond Aircraft designs had a 38° C</a> outside air temperature limit, <strong>past which the main spar is not considered structurally sound</strong>. </p>

"How is pressure related to air density?","54450","","<p>This is confusing to me:</p>

<p>Since pressure increases with temperature (I don't know why), how can air density decrease with temperature. In a hot day then pressure would increase and air density decrease? How is that possible? </p>

<hr>

<p>@casey @steve V. @StallSpin</p>

<p>The point is this: FAA writtten says:
The altimeter will indicate lower altitude than actually flown in a temp warmer than standard. I understand that this way: this an example</p>

<p>1) Indicated Altitude: 12.000ft
   True Altitude: 12.000ft
   Temperature: -9 Celsius (STD)</p>

<p>Then suddenly the air temperature changes from -9 to +20 (Example) and in a couple of minutes we have: </p>

<p>Indicated Altitude: 12.000ft
   True Altitude: 14.000ft
   (In warmer than stantard, pressure increases so the aneroid waffers in the altimeter will contract indicating lower altitude (lets say it indicated 10.000), then the pilot will climb ""back"" to 12.000 but in reality (true altitude) he is climbing to 14.000.</p>

<p>Am I getting this right?</p>

<p>2) Now another thing, temperature decreases with altitude, so aneroid waffers are expanded with altitude.</p>

<p>Does the aneroid waffers mesure density or pressure?</p>
","<p>The atmosphere approximates an ideal gas, and as such you can relate pressure and density through the ideal gas equation.  The form we use in meteorology uses mass density and is given by:</p>

<p>$$p={\rho}RT$$</p>

<p>where $P$ is pressure in units of Pa, $\rho$ is density in units of kg m-3, $R$ is the gas constant for dry air (287 J kg-1 K-1) and $T$ is temperature in Kelvin.  This assumes a dry atmosphere and humidity will decrease density for a given pressure.  Consideration for water vapor is usually brought in by changing temperature into virtual temperature $T_V$ where $T_V=T(1+0.61q)$ and $q$ is the mixing ratio of water vapor (units $kg~ kg^{-1}$). </p>

<hr>

<p>Pressure increases with temperature because the particles have more kinetic energy (which is proportional to $T$).  Imagine a box full of bouncing balls, if these balls start moving faster the balls will hit the walls of the box harder, imparting more force on the box.  Pressure is merely force per area, so if the force increases but the box stays the same size, the pressure has increased.</p>

<hr>

<p>Air density can decrease with temperature if pressure is also decreasing.  If pressure is constant, this cannot happen (they would be inversely related).  Any time you specify a relation between any two of pressure, density or temperature you must hold the third constant or specify its behavior.</p>

<p>For example, hot air rises, but why then is it cold on top of a mountain.  The answer is that hot air is less dense than the cold air surrounding it for a constant pressure, and being less dense it rises.  With a mountain, the pressure is decreasing, and we likewise find in the atmosphere that temperature decreases with decreasing pressure.</p>

<hr>

<p>On a hot day what tends to happen is that the surface, which is being warmed by the sun, heats the lowest level of the atmosphere, reducing its density (it is at the same pressure as its surroundings and its T rises).  This will eventually drive convection and mix this warmer air vertically.  Given enough time, this will reduce the mass in the column of air and therefore reduce the pressure at the surface.  These are called ""heat lows"" and you can see them forming in the desert areas and they play roles in sea breeze formation and the monsoons.</p>

<hr>

<p>To address the expanded question:</p>

<p>The point in the FAA written is best understood by forgetting that we fly at constant altitudes -- we don't.  In level flight we fly on constant pressure surfaces which we then translate to an altitude.  In any given column of atmosphere, if it is warmer than standard a given pressure surface will be higher and when colder than standard the pressure surface will be lower. </p>

<p>To illustrate, let's consider you are flying at 3000 ft or roughly 900 mb.  Everywhere on this pressure surface will indicate 3000 ft on our altimeter for its current setting.  If we go somewhere hot, this pressure surface rises, and so we climb (though we think we are level) with this pressure surface but because the pressure has not changed, we still indicate 3000 ft.  However, we are higher than 3000 ft in reality.  </p>

<p>This follows into your next question.  Aneroid wafers detect pressure changes and your altimeter displays an altitude <strong>not</strong> corrected for temperature.  This is why your true altitude can vary with temperature for a constant indicated altitude.  When you correct the altitude for temperature we call this ""density altitude"".  </p>

<p>So back to my example above, your are flying along at 900 mb and indicating 3000 ft, and heading into warmer air.  The pressure surface starts to gently rise and as it does you are not yet following that rise and your altimeter will indicate a descent.  In true level flight you will begin to fly into higher pressure in this case as the 900 mb surface rises above you and the aneroid wafer in your altimeter will indicate a lower altitude and a descent.  You correct this and climb back up to the 900 mb pressure level so that your altimeter will once again indicate 3000', all the while actually gently climbing on this pressure surface.  You won't really be cognizant of this while flying however, and will just minimize vertical speed and maintain altitude blissfully unaware that you are really flying on a sloping constant pressure surface.</p>

<p>To better illustrate this, consider the following figure:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lJp5d.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this figure the reds signify a warmer than average column of air and the blues a cooler then average column.  The whitish area in the middle is a column at average temperatures.  The black solid lines are isobars (lines of constant pressure).  The dashed black line is a true altitude above the surface. Finally, the bold black line is the pressure level that corresponds to the true altitude of the dashed line at ISA conditions.</p>

<p>What you should notice is that the pressure levels in the warm column are spaced further apart because the air is less dense and more of it is needed to produce the same pressure (as pressure is just the weight of all the air above it).  Likewise in the cool column the pressure levels are spaced closer together because the air is more dense than standard.  </p>

<p>To tie this into the discussions above, consider yourself in the standard column (white background) at the true altitude above ground represented by the dashed line.  Your altimeter does not sense this true altitude but instead senses the pressure outside of the airplane.  This will be roughly calibrated to your true altitude (uncorrected for temperature) but using the local altimeter setting.  Now as you fly either to the left or to the right and maintain a constant indicated altitude, you will track along the bold line, as this is the pressure that corresponds to your true altitude at standard temps.  As you fly toward a colder column you will in reality descend, and you will climb as you fly into the warmer column. </p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDPb4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Actually, there are three types of trails an aircraft can leave in the sky:</p>

<h3>1. Condensation of water vapor in the exhaust gas and/or the wake</h3>

<p>This needs the very cold, very dry air at higher altitudes between 6000m and 12000m. Water vapor in the exhaust stream condenses and, pushing the local air above its saturation water content, forms a white, frozen mist. Also, particles from partially burnt fuel form condensation cores wich stabilise the contrail and let it grow over time from humidity already present in the air. Depending on the atmospheric humidity, these contrails disappear rather quickly by sublimation or can stay in place for hours and even grow into cirrus clouds. They are called <strong>con</strong>densation <strong>trails</strong> or short ""contrails"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ASEI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ASEI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<em>Cirrus clouds triggered by aircraft contrails (picture <a href=""http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/CONCERT/images/contrail_cirrus.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</em></p>

<p>While the added water vapor in the exhaust gas helps in contrail production, the condensation happening in the pressure field around an aircraft can already produce a contrail all by itself. If the relative humidity is close to saturation and the condensed droplets freeze quickly, the aerodynamic contrail will disappear rather slowly. The same condensation happens also at lower altitude but will not leave a contrail  in temperatures above 0°C. Fog (liquid droplets) will vaporize quickly, but when frozen the condensation will last longer, until the water is re-absorbed by the air by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sublimation</a>, a much slower process than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evaporation</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Oil mist or smoke flares</h3>

<p>The third source is shown in your picture: Oil is injected into the hot exhaust stream which forms a dense mist. This can be done with jets and piston engines, and gliders or parachutists use smoke flares. Once they are ignited (in most cases electrically) they burn down and cannot be switched off.</p>

"What are different types of weights of an aircraft?","50759","","<p>When looking at different aircraft's specifications or in POHs/AFMs, there are several different weights of the aircraft mentioned (e.g. maximum take-off weight, maximum landing weight, operating empty weight).</p>

<p>What do they mean and how they are different?</p>
","<p>The different terms represent different weights or masses<sup>1</sup>. For each flight, the weights are taken into account for several reasons.</p>

<p>A brief description about these is below:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturer%27s_empty_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Manufacturer's empty weight</a> (MEW)</strong><br>
Also called <em>Manufacturer's Weight Empty (MWE)</em> or <em>Licensed Empty Weight</em></p>

<p>It is the weight of the aircraft ""as built"" and includes the weight of the structure, power plant, furnishings, installations, systems and other equipment that are considered an integral part of an aircraft.</p>

<p>This excludes any baggage, passengers, or usable fuel<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-fuel_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zero-fuel weight</a> (ZFW)</strong></p>

<p>This is the total weight of the airplane <em>and</em> all its contents (including unusable fuel), but excluding the total weight of the usable fuel on board.</p>

<p>As a flight progresses and fuel is consumed, the total weight of the airplane reduces, but the ZFW remains constant.</p>

<p>Maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW) is the maximum weight allowed before usable fuel and other specified usable agents (engine injection fluid, and other consumable propulsion agents) are loaded.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_empty_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Operating empty weight</a> (OEW)</strong> (Roughly equivalent to <em>basic empty weight</em> on light aircraft)</p>

<p>It is the basic weight of an aircraft including the crew, all fluids necessary for operation such as engine oil, engine coolant, water, unusable fuel and all operator items and equipment required for flight but excluding usable fuel and the payload.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Payload</a></strong></p>

<p>It is the carrying capacity of an aircraft. It includes cargo, people, extra fuel. In the case of a commercial airliner, it may refer only to revenue-generating cargo or paying passengers.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_takeoff_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maximum takeoff weight</a> (MTOW)</strong></p>

<p>This is the maximum weight at which the pilot of the aircraft is allowed to attempt to take off<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_takeoff_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Regulated takeoff weight</a> (RTOW)</strong></p>

<p>Depending on different factors (e.g. flap setting, altitude, air temperature, length of runway), RTOW or <em>maximum permissible takeoff weight</em> varies for each takeoff. It can never be higher than MTOW. More information is on <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/44144/65"">this answer</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_landing_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maximum landing weight</a> (MLW)</strong></p>

<p>This maximum weight at which an aircraft is permitted to land<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_ramp_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maximum ramp weight</a> (MRW)</strong><br>
<em>also called maximum taxi weight (MTW)</em></p>

<p>It is the maximum weight authorized for maneuvering (taxiing or towing) an aircraft on the ground.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_gross_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aircraft gross weight</a></strong></p>

<p>It is the total aircraft weight at any moment during the flight or ground operation. This decreases during flight due to fuel and oil consumption.</p>

Having a Physics background, I tend to agree and know the difference between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_versus_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">weight and mass</a>. I did not use <em>mass</em> as most of the references I included referred mass as weight. However, using correct terminology, all the weights mean mass. Thanks <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/users/572/sentryraven"">SentryRaven</a> for pointing it out.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>: <strong>What is the different between usable fuel and unusable fuel?</strong><br>
<em>Usable fuel</em> is the fuel on board an aircraft that can actually be used by its engines. The small amount of fuel that cannot be drained from the tanks is the <em>unusable fuel</em>. For calculation of range, usable fuel is used. For weight and balance total fuel (usable + unusable) is used.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>: This restriction is due to structural, design or operational limitations.</p>

"What are the differences between fuel types (comparing with vehicles)?","50647","","<p>I find it funny that at gas stations, generally you can purchase ""regular"" gasoline (in various octane levels) or diesel. At airports, generally you can purchase 100LL avgas or Jet-A.</p>

<p>Can you compare diesel to Jet-A, and ""regular"" gasoline to avgas? If so, what are the differences? Why are there only two classes of fuel - are there others that I don't know about?</p>
","<p>Broadly speaking, there are three families of motor fuel that you're probably interested in: <strong>Diesels</strong>, <strong>Kerosenes</strong>, and <strong>Gasolines</strong>.<br>
The difference between the families mainly has to do with the molecular weight (and thus boiling point / vapor pressure) of the fuel components - in order above from heaviest to lightest. The differences within each family are related to refining, blending, and additives, as well as process controls imposed on the fuel.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Diesel Family</h2>

<p>In the diesel family we have things like Highway Diesel and the various grades of home heating oil.  </p>

<p>For transportation purposes these fuels are used in compression-ignition engines (""diesel engines""), where a high temperature and pressure will cause the fuel to ignite and burn, producing power.<br>
For other purposes (like heating) we basically light the stuff on fire and are happy it burns.</p>

<h2>The Kerosene Family</h2>

<p>The Kerosene family are close cousins of the Diesels, including K-1 and K-2 Kerosene (obviously) and Jet-A.</p>

<p>Jet-A is a high-purity kerosene based fuel manufactured under a specific ASTM standard (D1655), with specific physical properties, and is used in jet turbine engines.  Fuel not meeting the Jet-A specification is generally recycled in the production chain for other purposes (for example it may be used in blending kerosene for heating, or blended into highway diesel).</p>

<p>Jet-A is suited for turbine engines, but can also be burned in other compression-ignition piston engines like diesel can (there are a wide variety of <a href=""http://www.deltahawkengines.com"">aerodiesel engines</a> available from several manufacturers).</p>

<p>Other grades of Kerosene are used for motor fuels, cooking fuel (""camp stove fuel"" is typically kerosene) heating, lighting, etc. depending on their refining and purity.</p>

<h2>The Gasoline Family</h2>

<p>In the gasoline family we have Avgas, Autogas, and ""Gasohol"", all designed for use in spark-ignition engines.</p>

<h3>Aviation Gasoline (Avgas)</h3>

<p>Avgas actually comes in several grades, all manufactured to an ASTM standard (D910), with specific physical properties and specific permitted and required additives (such as Tetra-Ethyl Lead - TEL).   </p>

<p>The grade (octane rating) of aviation gasoline is identified by colored dyes added to the blend.<br>
The colors used in the US are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Green: AvGas 100 (100/130 Octane)</li>
<li>Blue: AvGas 100LL (100/130 Octane)<br>
(This was formulated as a replacement for AvGas 100, with half the lead - hence 100<b>LL</b> - Low Lead)</li>
<li>Red: AvGas 80 (80/87 Octane)</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally 100LL is the most widely available aviation fuel because it works in the widest range of engines. </p>

<h3>Autogas (automotive gasoline)</h3>

<p>Automotive gasoline comes in multiple octane grades, but generally it's all varying blends of ""regular"" (87 octane) and ""premium"" (93 octane or higher).<br>
Automotive gasoline is manufactured under a different ASTM standard from Aviation gasoline (there are several applicable standards, D4814 is commonly used), which permits different additives including ethanol (usually up to 10%).  </p>

<h3>""Gasohol""</h3>

<p>Gasohol is a slang term for automotive gasoline with <em>any</em> amount of ethanol blended into it, but these days it's often used to refer to blends like E85 (85% Ethanol, 15% gasoline stock).<br>
Flex-fuel car engines and a few other specialty engines are designed to burn this fuel.</p>

<hr>

<h2>So what's the difference?</h2>

<p>Why don't we burn highway diesel or heating kerosene in a 747?<br>
In a word, purity. The additional controls imposed on Jet-A fuel by the associated standard produce a product with well-known properties. When you fuel a plane with Jet-A you can be confident that fuel won't freeze in the tanks at altitude (at least not unless you cold-soak it below -40 degrees). You also know the fuel will be ""clean"" and won't gunk up fuel filters or leave deposits inside the combustion core of the engine that can cause problems later.</p>

<p>On the other hand we don't burn Jet-A in a Mack Truck because it would be prohibitively expensive: Highway diesel doesn't have to meet the same strict tolerances as jet fuel, and theres no reason to burn a more tightly specified (and thus more expensive) fuel when a less expensive one is readily available.</p>

<hr>

<p>The difference between Aviation Gasoline and Automotive Gasoline is a bit more subtle: the core blend stocks are extremely similar, but the additive packages are very different.</p>

<p>The biggest concern for aviation users is usually the ethanol commonly blended into automotive gasoline: Rubber components in aircraft fuel systems were not designed to handle alcohols, and can be damaged/degraded by ethanol.  </p>

<p>For cars the concern is the lead found in aviation gasoline. Any ""modern"" car (with a catalytic converter and oxygen sensors in the exhaust system) can't burn leaded fuel as the lead byproducts in the exhaust will foul both the catalyst matrix and the oxygen sensors (though a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Belvedere"">1950s Plymouth Belvedere</a> would have no trouble burning the stuff).</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/avgas/"">Work on an unleaded aviation fuel is ongoing</a> - theoretically the fuel that comes out of that process could be equally suitable as a road fuel and an aviation fuel, however the chances of it making its way to your corner gas station are relatively slim, except possibly as a blend stock from batches that don't meet the final specification for a 100-octane unleaded aviation fuel, but are suitable for recycling into automotive gasoline blends.</p>

"What is the difference between OAT, RAT, TAT, and SAT?","49038","","<p>When I first started flying jet aircraft, I found different instruments that measure temperature in different ways and it was quite confusing.  </p>

<p>What is the difference between Outside Air Temperature, Ram Air Temperature (RAT), Total Air Temperature (TAT), Static Air Temperature (SAT), and any that I might have missed?</p>
","<p>As you measure temperature moving at high velocities, your outside thermometer will measure a higher temp than what is actually outside (what a non-moving thermometer would get). That's because as the air rams into your thermometer it gets a little bit compressed, and that makes it heat up a little bit. </p>

<p>Amazingly, some smart people have even calculated how much that ""ram rise"" is, and you can actually compensate (well, in theory) from the indicated temperature to calculate what the actual outside air temp is: </p>

<p>$$Ram~Rise=SAT\times0.2\times{M}^2$$</p>

<p>Where $SAT$ is Static Air Temperature in Kelvin, $M$ is Mach number</p>

<p>Problem is, not all instruments will compress that air in the same way, and not all of them will pick up this Ram Rise entirely. So they will publish a $K$, a ram-rise-coefficient (also called recovery factor) meaning how much of from the theoretical Ram Rise they actually pick up.</p>

<p><strong>(OAT/SAT) Static Air Temperature</strong> = noted as $T_S$, actual temperature of the air outside, the same your thermometer will pick up if you were not moving 
(say, in a balloon?)</p>

<p><strong>(RAT) Ram Air Temperature</strong> = noted as $T_M$, actual measured temperature by your instrument.</p>

<p>$$RAT=SAT+k\times{Ram~Rise}$$ </p>

<p><strong>(TAT) Total Air Temperature</strong> = noted as $T_T$, total temperature as measured by an instrument with $K$-coefficient of $1$.  </p>

<p>$$TAT=SAT+Ram~Rise$$</p>

"What are the pros and cons of high-wing compared to low-wing design?","47759","","<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a high-wing vs. low-wing aircraft design? When might one prefer one to the other?</p>

<p>Is the answer the same for large and small aircraft?</p>
","<p>This is actually a really hard question to answer, as there are a ton of factors. I'll try to cover a few.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong> is probably the reason you most hear when it comes to GA pilots. 
<ul>
<li>High-wing aircraft offer better visibility below the aircraft, especially for passengers in 4-seat or larger aircraft, as the wing doesn't block it. </li>
<li>Low-wing aircraft can offer better visibility above the aircraft, as the wing remains mostly out of the field of view.</li>
<li><em>Note that a lot of midair collisions involve mixed types; low-wing aircraft descend into high-wing, or high-wing aircraft climb into low-wing.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Landing characteristics</strong> are different, as low-wing aircraft can incur more ground effect than high-wing.</li>
<li><strong>Aerodynamic stability</strong> of the two designs differs a bit; the center of lift can be higher in a high-wing design, often offset with dihedral in low-wing aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Ground clearance</strong> (and debris protection), specifically in multi-engine aircraft, is going to be greater when engines are mounted on a high wing rather than a low wing. This is true of both propeller and jet engines, although propellers tend to have a larger radius for a given aircraft size.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a bunch more, but that ought to get the <del>argument</del> discussion going.</p>

"Why do large aircraft have their engines mostly on the wings, while smaller ones tend to have them in the tail or the tip?","46869","","<p>Large passenger planes almost always have their engines hanging from the wings, Fighters usually have them in the rear, and small Cessnas have them on the nose.</p>

<p>What is the reason for these variations in design?</p>
","<p>Small aircraft need very low mounted wings to allow for a decent cabin height. The last commercial airliner which required the passengers to climb over the wing spar on their way to their seat was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_247"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boeing P-247</a>. Low wings do not allow the necessary space for engines, so the next best location is on the rear fuselage. Also, small aircraft have a relatively short fuselage, and the gear can be made short (and light) without risking a tail strike on rotation.</p>

<p>Fighters need to have small moments of inertia, especially in roll, so they cannot afford to put engines on the wings. Even the Me-262 was initially planned with fuselage-mounted engines, that's why it had this peculiar triangular fuselage cross section. Only when the engines grew in diameter during development they had to be placed on the wing.</p>

<p>Pros of rear-mounted / fuselage-mounted engines:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wing is clean, having low drag and optimum conditions for lift creation.</li>
<li>The engines are easy to access (if mounted at the rear fuselage. Different story with buried engines!).</li>
<li>Smaller vertical tail needed for asymmetric thrust conditions.</li>
<li>Shorter, lighter landing gear possible (if rotation capability is not compromised).</li>
<li>Low roll inertia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons of rear-mounted / fuselage-mounted engines:</p>

<ul>
<li>No bending relief for the wing; heavier wing spar needed.</li>
<li>No help in flutter supression (a mass ahead of the elastic line helps).</li>
<li>Possible interference with wing wake at high angle of attack.</li>
<li>Forces the tail to be a T-tail configuration.</li>
<li>More structure needed to carry the thrust forces forward.</li>
<li>Intake noise is more audible, especially for passengers in the rear seats.</li>
</ul>

<p>This picture of a Cessna Citation X should illustrate the point nicely.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SZT3m.jpg"" alt=""Cessna Citation X, demonstrating low wing and short gear""></p>

"Why don't small planes use turbine (turboprop) engines?","46834","","<p>Turboprop engines are <strike>more fuel efficient</strike><sup>1</sup>, lighter for the same power, mechanically simpler and consequently more reliable.  They are also slightly easier to operate (no need to fiddle with mixture) and burn cheaper fuel. As a result they replaced piston engines in all transport aircraft long ago. So why didn't they find their way into small GA planes (basically everything above 8-10 seats uses turboprops, but in the 4-seat category, nothing does)?</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sub>Actually looks like I was mistaken. Reciprocating engines seem to be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_specific_fuel_consumption"">more efficient</a>.</sub></p>
","<p>First, piston engines are <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1086/rotary-engine-planes-in-commercial-flights/10037#10037"">more efficient than turboprops</a>, so their operational cost are lower. This also means that the system mass (engine plus fuel) for a trip is lower once you go beyond small ranges. In a helicopter, the engine mass is more important, because average flight times are much shorter, so you find many helicopters with turbo engines and only few with pistons.</p>

<p>Next, there is a well developed infrastructure for maintenance on those pistons, and new turboprops would need new, expensive infrastructure (trained people, tools, spare parts ...)</p>

<p>And then there is simply no incentive to develop a new GA engine. The expense to get it certified is too large for the rather small market. This is the same as for Diesel engines.</p>

What is the lifespan of one airframe on average in general use by airlines, before it is scrapped?</p>
","<p>Metal fatigue is normally the limiting factor of an aircraft's lifespan. Fatigue cracks build up every flight (start &amp; landing), called a cycle. Therefore the design life of an aircraft is typically given in cycles.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SORHl.jpg"" alt=""Metal fatigue"">Metal fatigue cracks</p>

<p>source: <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/2012_q4/2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boeing</a></p>

<hr>

<p>For long haul aircraft, that make relatively few cycles, the design lifespan is in the order of 40 000 cycles. For short haul the number is higher, sometimes up to 111 000 cycles. </p>

<p>For example, the Boeing 747 has a design number of cycles of 35 000, the MD-80 has 110 000. </p>

<p>An aircraft should be operable for about 30 years before reaching the cycle limit. The lifetime can be stretched by special inspection and maintenance programs.</p>

"If I own land, can I create a private runway on my property for my own use?","44736","","<p>In the United States, if I own land that has an area suitable for landing a small general aviation airplane, can I just create a private runway, or do I have to officially be registered with the FAA or some government agency?</p>
","<p>In short: Yes, you can. The FAA doesn't really care, as long as you're not going to interrupt class B or C operations. And honestly as long as you're not hosting a dozen other aircraft, how are they going to tell the difference between a field and an airstrip? If you want it on a chart or you are near special airspace, you need to contact the FSDO and talk to them about it (it's good to do that anyway). They will send someone out to survey it and talk with you, and hopefully approve it.</p>

<p>It's the local authorities that usually ends up being troublesome. Your state/county/city might have laws that apply, and you'll need to find that out on your own. A friend of mine spent just a few days talking/meeting with the FAA on his strip, but spent weeks dealing with the state transportation department and a local ban on new grass strips which he sat right on the border of (as in it was a ban in a 50 mile radius and his house was on mile 50). </p>

<p><em>I don't own my own private jet so I'm afraid I can't check for myself.</em></p>

<p>How does security work around privately owned planes landing in public airports?</p>
","<p>Here in the US (you didn't specify where, and this is different in other countries), traveling domestically in your own private aircraft is much like traveling in your own private car.</p>

<p>Except in very specific situations, you are not generally required to go through security, and at many, many smaller general aviation airports airport security is almost non-existent, or at the very least they are not checking passengers and their luggage.</p>

<p>If the police have a reason to suspect that something illegal is taking place (they have reasonable cause) then they can search the airplane, but again, much like in your car, this doesn't usually happen.</p>

","<p>A license, once granted, is good forever (barring some enforcement action).</p>

<p>But, you need more than just a license to fly.  To <em>use</em> your license, while flying solo, you also need a Medical Certificate (if required for the aircraft or flight rules) and a Current BFR (Biennial Flight Review).</p>

<p>Medical Certificates are good for 5 years until you're 40, then good for 2 years.
Its a quick trip to an FAA approved doctor to examine you for any obvious medical conditions.</p>

<p>A BFR is a review with an instructor every two years to make sure you're still proficient and safe.  If all goes well, it takes about 90 minutes.</p>

<p>If your 90-day landings have lapsed, you can quickly fix it with 3 trips around the pattern, taking off and landing each time (touch-n-go during the day, or full-stop at night).  Then taxi back to the ramp, pick up your passengers, and go on your way.</p>

<p>As the airfoil angle of attack changes, the pressure field changes. Due to this, the <em>center of pressure changes with variation in the angle of attack</em>. In the airplane's normal range of flight attitudes, if the angle of attack is increased, the center of pressure moves forward; and if decreased, it moves rearward.</p>

<p>As the center of gravity (the point where the weight of the body acts) is fixed, this movement of center of pressure affects the  stability of the aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>Aerodynamic Center</strong> The resultant (or the pressure forces) also cause a moment on the airfoil. As the angle of attack increases, the pitching moment at a point (for example, the center of gravity) also changes. However, the pitching moment remains constant at a particular point, which is called the aerodynamic center.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/09cSD.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/09cSD.jpg"" alt=""Aerodynamic Center""></a></p>

<p>Source: www.theairlinepilots.com</p>

<p>For symmetric airfoils in subsonic flight the aerodynamic center is located approximately 25% of the chord from the leading edge of the airfoil. This point is described as the quarter-chord point. </p>

<p>Thus the <em>aerodynamic center does not change with variation in angle of attack</em>. Due to this, the aerodynamic center, rather than the center of pressure is used in the analysis of longitudinal stability.</p>

<p><strong>Neutral Point</strong> Consider the whole aircraft. The lift of the wing acting through the center of pressure is in front of the center of gravity of the aircraft. This causes a destabilizing motion (increase in lift to increase in angle of attack causes a nose up moment, further increasing angle of attack). This is counteracted by the moment produced by the lift of the horizontal stabilizer (which is a small wing), acting behind the center of gravity.</p>

<p>As the center of gravity is moved aft, the main wing lift moment arm increases and the aircraft stability decreases. The aircraft is said to be <em>statically unstable</em>.</p>

<p>As the aircraft is stable when center of gravity is in the nose and unstable when center of gravity is in the tail, there is a position in the middle where the aircraft is neither stable nor unstable i.e the stability is neutral. This point is called the neutral point. The neutral point is fixed for a particular aerodynamic configuration of the aircraft.</p>

","<p>It depends on the engine.

"Why are the lights inside commercial airplanes turned off during take off and landing?","40942","","<p>Before landing and taking off, I notice the lights inside commercial aircraft are greatly reduced. I don't buy the explanation of power saving in case full thrust is needed as nowaday lights don't need a lot of energy and the crew says we can use the smaller reading lamp to continue reading. I suppose this is something to do with security but I don't understand what.</p>
","<p>This is for safety reasons. </p>

<p>Take-Off and Landing are the two most critical phases of flight and thus, every additional step to ensure survivability, be it even just adjusting the light, is taken.</p>

<p>The interior lights or cabin lights are adjusted to match the exterior environment, so that in case of an emergency, especially if the interior lights fail, your eyes are already accustomed to the light setting and you do not require additional valuable seconds for adjustment to a possibly darker or brighter environment. The lights are usually adjusted at dusk, night or dawn to match the exterior environment.<a href=""http://gofar.aircanada.com/go-far-answers/question/cabin-lights-dimmed/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></p>

<p>If the cabing lights do not fail during an emergency, the dimmed light also makes it easier to identify the ""EXIT"" signs which illuminate and make the guidance lighting on the floor easier to follow. The bright emergency lighting is more prominent to identify when the cabin light is dimmed, saving valuable seconds as the aircraft is evacuated.</p>

<p>This also ties in with having to raise the blinds on the windows. The blinds need to be raised during take-off and landing irrespective of the outside light situation, however, with a darker cabin, any outside light source, especially from fires or other hazards is easier to identify by the crew, making the decision process of whether one side could be inappropriate to use for evacuation faster, e.g. fire on port side --> no evacation on that side.</p>

<p>The blinds are therefore raised to allow a better view for cabin crew of the outside area and external aircraft parts, such as engines, wings, etc.

","<p>On a pilot-vs-FBW system perspective, as mentioned in the comments to the question, the most notable difference is the authority priority:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Boeing trusts more the pilots: they can supersede the Fly-by-wire automatic commands by exerting enough force on the controls</p></li>
<li><p>Airbus trusts more the FBW system: if the system is fully functional (""Normal law"") it will always have priority over the pilots to protect the aircraft and keep it in the envelope, but they still have room for ""non-standard"" maneuvers, e.g. commanding bank angles between 33° and 60°. The autopilot can be activated and de-activated at will by the pilots, and it sits on top of the FBW envelope protection.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>One of the most famous examples where this comparison emerges (and the subsequent debate about which approach is better) is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines_Flight_006"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">China Airlines 006</a> accident.
I won't go into detail, there is the <a href=""http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">accident report</a> that will provide much more information that I can remember, but suffice to say that this 747 was recovered from a quite unusual attitude</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jef6s.jpg"" alt=""China Airlines 006 attitude history""></p>

<p>As mentioned in the wiki article, the report states that the passengers were subject up to 5 gs during the maneuver and the stress on the horizontal tail surface has been so great that as a result it was damaged:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wXm0h.jpg"" alt=""China Airlines 006 tail damage""></p>

<p>The usual argumentation goes along the lines that, would this had been an Airbus, the pilots would not have been able to save the aircraft.
See for example <a href=""http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:22554e85-9506-4410-9fb3-9ad6af4b2c8d/W._Falkena_-_PhD_Thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this PhD thesis</a> at page 184 of the pdf, section 6.2.3 ""Pilot Authority at the Boundary"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is likely that if the aircraft had prevented the crew from initiating control commands that would lead to aircraft damage, the aircraft (and passengers) would have been lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with such a comparison? It focuses on the recovery after the unusual attitude was achieved and totally forgets about the sequence of events that lead to it or, to the very least, assumes that an Airbus would have responded in the same way to the preceding events (then why make a comparison at all?)</p>

<p>An honest comparison would take into account this and acknowledge that an Airbus in Normal Law would not enter a spiral dive in the first place, even with an engine out, as bank protection/attitude-hold would prevent it.</p>

"What's the functional difference between PAPI and VASI?","40720","","<p>PAPI and VASI seem to be very similar in the the information they provide - i.e. are you on the glide slope or off it. Is there a functional difference between the two? If there is a difference, and one is superior to the other, is there a construction cost savings where an airport might chose one over the other?</p>
","<p>A PAPI and a VASI are very similar in the the information they provide. The only functional differences between the VASI and PAPI is that the VASI has the red over the white, the PAPI the white actually goes to the right of the red, and the PAPI offers higher precision (or more glideslopes depending how you look at it a larger airliner with a high cockpit may elect to fly a slightly higher glidepath). The concept is the same though.</p>

<p>A <strong>VASI</strong> looks like this:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGBaq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong>:</p>

<p>As the saying goes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Red over White, you're alright. (on glidepath)</p>
  
  <p>Red over Red, you're dead. (too low)</p>
  
  <p>White over White, you're out-of-sight (too high)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ygdlp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A <strong>PAPI</strong> like this:
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/PAPI_Jersey_Airport.JPG"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A regular VASI only offers one glide slope and is designed for an aircraft where the cockpit isn't so high up. <em>However</em>, there is a such thing as two-light PAPI, and a three-bar VASI. So either of them can really be tailored to fit the costs and types of aircraft flying to that airport.</p>

<p>In the case of a four-bar PAPI it is higher precision. Since the PAPI systems uses a narrower beam of light you must fly the glide path more precisely than the VASI to stay on the beam. The PAPI, with its extra lights, forewarns you when you are drifting from the desired glide path.</p>

<p><a href=""http://airportlightingcompany.com/images/PAPI-Diagram.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://airportlightingcompany.com/images/PAPI-Diagram.gif</a></p>

<p>So one red light would indicate slightly above glide slope, two and two would indicate the normal glide slope, and three red lights would indicate slightly below the glide slope on a 4-bar PAPI. A Three bar VASI works in similar fashion except there are only two glide paths with two reds being the lower, two whites the higher.</p>

<p>All of the above applies to modern aircraft.</p>

<p>Previously, say the 1970s and before, 2 seat fighters were sometimes necessary due to the technology available at that time. The F-4 and F-14 for example, the 2nd seater operated the radar because the pilot really couldn't keep his head in the cockpit when engaging multiple enemy contacts or when the fight was close in. Head up displays weren't available so the aircraft systems available to the pilot by necessity was kept limited in order to limit pilot overload. </p>

"How does thrust reversal work on a jet engine, and when should it be used?","39317","","<p>A two part question this time, though they are closely related enough that I figured I'd knock them out all at once.  I figure the first question probably informs the second question anyway.</p>

<p>Firstly, how does a jet engine flip over to reverse thrust?  I'm assuming the turbine doesn't actually switch directions.  Is there a set of blades towards the rear of the engine that divert the flow forward again?  How's that work?</p>

<p>Probably more topically:  When is the right time to apply reverse thrust?  I'm assuming you ought to be on the ground (that seems like a given), but are there checks that a pilot has to do before engaging the reverse thrust?  Are there times when it's not used, or when it possibly just isn't necessary?</p>
","<p>The engine does not move, the air flow is only redirected. The method of redirecting the flow varies with the size, configuration, and manufacturer of the engine. The flow does not need to be directed completely forward; the flow is generally mostly outwards and partially foward. This is still enough to create significant drag and slow the aircraft down.</p>

<p>In smaller and older engines, the entire flow is redirected. This corresponds to the first to configurations below. Buckets or clamshell doors close over the jet flow to redirect the air.</p>

<p>In larger engines, particularly high-bypass turbofans, only part of the air is redirected. This corresponds to the last configuration below. The core air from the engine still exits normall, but the bypass air from the fan is redirected. Since the bypass air on these engines is a much greater flow than the engine core air, this results in a net reverse thrust. There are multiple mechanisms, but the general idea is to deploy doors that block the bypass air and send it through the sides of the engine cowl.</p>

<p>Turboprop aircraft just change the pitch of the propeller blades such that the propeller pushes air forward instead of backward. The pitch in which the blades provide reverse thrust is called the ""beta range.""
<hr>
In civil aircraft, reverse thrust is only used when on the ground. There are typically interlocks in the system that prevent the thrust reversers from deploying if the aircraft does not sense that it is on the ground. Once the aircraft touches down, the pilot will deploy the reverse thrust. Some military aircraft like the C-17 can use reverse thrust in the air. This enables them to perform very steep descents.</p>

<p>Reverse thrust is more of an ""optional"" method of braking (see this <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1219/for-large-jets-what-is-the-primary-means-of-slowing-down-after-landing"">related question</a>), only to provide extra stopping power when needed. This particularly helps when braking force is less effective, such as in rain or snow. Before landing, pilots will take into account the wind, aircraft weight, runway length, and any contamination of the runway (rain or snow). Based on this they will know what kind of braking force is needed and whether they should use thrust reversers.</p>

<p>The thrust reversers don't always have to be operational for an aircraft to fly. Some operators choose to disable them, which decreases maintenance costs. The thrust reversers can also break, in which case they will be mechanically locked to prevent them from deploying until they can be fixed. Pilots will consider this when they are computing their landing distance.</p>

<p>The most basic form, as found on most light aircraft is elevator trim. Usually operated by a wheel, it moves the elevator up or down by a small amount in the same sense as the yoke (back to go up, forward to go down). This can be used to settle the aircraft into straight flight.</p>

<p>Another form of trim is rudder trim. Often found in larger light aircraft and twin-engined aircraft it can be used to adjust for a crosswind to keep the aircraft flying straight. On multi-engine aircraft it can also be used to trim out the differential thrust caused by one engine failing.</p>

Having seen air-borne personnel lining up and parachuting out of a C130, what is preventing flights from equipping each passenger with a life-saving parachute? Is it very technically challenging for an untrained person to deploy a parachute, or are there other reasons?</p>
","<p>Qualification: I worked at a sport parachute center as an instructor for 10 years and I hold an FAA Master Parachute Rigger certificate. I believe that qualifies me as an expert on the subject.</p>

<p>The majority of the <strike>above</strike> other statements here are correct. In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The door of a pressurized passenger plane cannot be opened in flight for the stated reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>the door of most larger passenger planes cannot be opened in flight after you depressurize the cabin because they swing forward. Push a sheet of plywood against a thunderstorm-grade wind and see how well you do. Now multiply the wind speed by 5.</p></li>
<li><p>even if you blow the door out with explosives, the chances of an orderly exit are slim. At airliner speeds an orderly exit is critical if you expect to survive the jump. Street clothes will be torn to shreds. Oh, and it's COLD up there.</p></li>
<li><p>you cannot depressurize an aircraft over 12,000 feet altitude without the passengers passing out rather quickly. If you can control the plane down to this altitude, you don't need the parachutes.</p></li>
<li><p>it is <em>extremely</em> difficult to exit an unstable aircraft that is built for sport parachuting (in-flight door, suitable handles, door already open). If the plane is spinning and you are beside the door you might get tossed out and then struck by other parts of the airframe. If it's a larger plane and the door (or you) are away from the current axis of rotation, good luck. Yes, jumpers have successfully exited a crippled jump plane. None of them want to try it again.</p></li>
<li><p>modern sport parachutes use steerable ram-air canopies. Jump one of these without any training and you will hurt yourself landing. Most emergency parachutes are round. Jump one of those without any training and you <em>will</em> break something when you land. 200 untrained people jumping ram-air canopies all at once will result in a number of collisions and entanglements, which are typically fatal for all involved.</p></li>
<li><p>exiting an airplane below 1000 feet is really not practical. I would do it IF a) the plane is currently under control; b) landing is not practical; c) It's really 1000 feet, not less; d) I'm sitting beside the door. Possible scenario is the engine goes boom and I know there's nothing but rocky land ahead of us. Of course my gear is already on my back ready to go, and I know how to use it. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There have been many cases of a jump plane experiencing engine problems on the way up. By the time the pilot turns around, the cabin is usually empty. There have also been cases where jump planes have crashed on takeoff. None of the (very experienced) jumpers on board thought about anything other than tightening the seatbelt. </p>

<p>Points I disagree with: (although they do not change the outcome)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Emergency parachutes (seat-pack types) are available for far less than sport rigs. Maybe $1,500 each. Weight around 8-10kg. Putting a purpose-built one on would be not much more complicated than a 4-point harness. This was seriously considered back in the 1950's - aircraft seats were designed with parachutes built in.

"What is different between a B737 and B757?","38027","","<p>Both are single aisle, 3 by 3 seating planes.  Both are vaguely similar in length (with appropriate models).  But they have fairly different ranges.  </p>

<p>For similar sized airplanes, why the big difference?</p>
","<p>Although the 737 has grown over the years, the 737 and 757 remain in different size classes. Both models can be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS"">ETOPS</a> certified, although the 757 is more often used in long flights.</p>

<p>At the time the 757 was introduced (in the 80's), the 737 classic series was current. For the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B737#Specifications"">737-400</a>:</p>

<p>Passengers: 146<br>
Length: 119 feet<br>
Wingspan: 95 feet<br>
Wing area: 1135 sq feet<br>
MTOW: 138,000 lb<br>
Takeoff distance: 8000 feet<br>
Range: 2160 nm<br>
Thrust: 2x 23,500 lbf<br>
Max fuel: 5,311 US gal</p>

<p>The 757 was significantly larger. For the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B757#Specifications"">757-200</a>:</p>

<p>Passengers: 200<br>
Length: 155 feet<br>
Wingspan: 125 feet<br>
Wing area: 1951 sq feet<br>
MTOW: 255,000 lb<br>
Takeoff distance: 6500 feet<br>
Range: 4100 nm<br>
Thrust: 2x 43,500 lbf<br>
Max fuel: 11,489 US gal</p>

<p>The 757 is about 35 feet longer, seats about 50 more passengers, and flies about 2,000 nm further (roughly twice as far). The extra range is due to the larger wingspan and longer fuselage, being able to carry more fuel. For this reason, the 757 is used on longer and busier routes, while the 737 is used on shorter, less busy routes.</p>

<p>In the 90's, both models were updated. The 737 was significantly upgraded, including new wings and a new engine, which increased its efficiency. The 737 NG series eventually included the <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/737family/pf/pf_900ER_back.page"">737-900ER</a> model, currently the largest 737 model.</p>

<p>Passengers: 180<br>
Length: 138 feet<br>
Wingspan: 117 feet<br>
Wing area: 1341 sq feet<br>
MTOW: 187,700 lb<br>
Takeoff distance: 9843 feet<br>
Range: 3235 nm<br>
Thrust: 2x 28,400 lbf<br>
Max fuel: 7,837 US gal</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B757#Specifications"">757-300</a> was also introduced. This was a stretched version of the 757-200.</p>

<p>Passengers: 243<br>
Length: 178 feet<br>
Wingspan: 125 feet<br>
Wing area: 1951 sq feet<br>

Range: 3595 nm<br>
Thrust: 2x 43,500 lb<br>
Max fuel: 11,489 US gal<br></p>

<p>Although the more efficiency gains of the new 737 bring the range up to nearly that of the 757, the 757 remains significantly larger.</p>

<p>The only reason (and I'm not sure if I should answer my own question) is that they need something to shoot warning shots over the bow of another airplane. But that seems an awful amount of weight for this rare occasion. And it'd mean loading tracer rounds.</p>

","<p>You can find the 4 segment climb profile described for transport category airplanes in the <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/PHAK%20-%20Chapter%2010.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25) Ch 10</a> and codified in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d5dad51bd56dabc931580b1171f72b2d&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.11.2.155.13&amp;rgn=div8"" rel=""noreferrer"">14 CFR 25.111</a>.  The full 4 segment profile described below assumes an engine failure at $V_1$ and stipulates a climb and speed profile to clear obstacles.  During normal all-engine ops this profile is still technically in place but you'll hit your speed and altitude targets in such a way that you'll takeoff into a climb with increasing airspeed and no intermediate level off (you will still likely use parts of the profile for your flap retraction schedule).</p>

<p>The segments of the climb are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Liftoff to 35' and $V_2$<br>
At liftoff you are assumed to be in takeoff configuration with at least one engine not operating.  After liftoff you will retract the gear and accelerate to $V_2$ while climbing.  The goal here is the reach 35' height before the end of your takeoff distance.  Note that for propeller aircraft, this height is 50' instead of 35'.</p></li>
<li><p>35' to acceleration height flown at $V_2$<br>
During this segment you climb at $V_2$ until you reach a height at which it is safe to level off and accelerate.  This height is called the acceleration height and is normally 400' AGL.  However, this value can vary per runway and will be available to you in your performance data for a particular runway.  </p></li>
<li><p>Level flight at acceleration height to $V_{FS}$
You are clear of all obstacles, and now your goal shifts from altitude to airspeed.  Level the airplane and accelerate.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue climbing at $V_{FS}$ to 1500' (typical)<br>
Once $V_{FS}$ is reached you will continue to climb at that airspeed.  This will also mark your transition from takeoff flaps to a clean configuration.  The height of 1500' is a typical value but may be different based on obstacles for a specific runway.</p></li>
<li><p>Enroute climb<br>
Upon reaching 1500' (or whatever altitude is used in the previous segment) at $V_{FS}$ you transition into your enroute climb.  At this altitude you will begin to perform checklists for the engine failure you experienced between $V_1$ and liftoff and your after takeoff flows and checklists.</p></li>

","<p>Yes It's true. And yes it's related to pressure. </p>

<p>Have you heard of ""The bends"" or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"">decompression sickness</a>? </p>

<p>As divers go deeper the pressure increases. The longer you dive and deeper you go the more nitrogen is absorbed into your blood as a dissolved gas. As you return to the surface the pressure reduces and the nitrogen reverts to gas bubbles.</p>

<p>This decompression needs to be done slowly so the nitrogen can pass back out through your lungs.  If you ascend too fast the nitrogen can form bubbles in your blood (Just like when you open a bottle of coke.) which can be painful and possibly fatal. </p>

<p>Even once you have finished diving you will still have residual nitrogen in your blood which will take time to release.</p>

<p>Air pressure reduces further when you fly. If you finished a dive and got in a plane the rapid climb in altitude would result in a drop in pressure similar to a rapid ascent while diving. So you would run the risk of getting the bends.</p>

<p>Small planes aren't pressurized. But even pressurized planes might not maintain atmospheric pressure when flying.</p>

</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect this heavy depends on the type of the aircraft, so lets assume we are considering a small airplane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely right, it does vary widely. The parameter you're asking about is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio#Glide_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glide ratio</a> and it is directly related to another parameter called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio#Glide_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lift-to-drag ratio</a> or <strong>L/D ratio</strong>. This is a fundamental characteristic of the aerodynamics of a particular aircraft. L/D ratio varies with airspeed; for determining best engine-out glide performance, the L/D ratio at ""best glide airspeed"" is used. ""Best glide airspeed"" is the speed that maximizes the L/D ratio, and this maximum value is known as <strong>L/D<sub>max</sub></strong>.</p>

<p>The maximum L/D ratio (L/D<sub>max</sub>) of a Cessna 172 is about 9, so its glide ratio is about 9:1 - for every 9 units traveled forward it will lose 1 unit of altitude. So, it will glide about 9,000 feet for every 1,000 feet of altitude available. This is a fairly typical value for small planes.</p>

<p>To show you how widely variable this is, a modern glider can achieve ratios above 60:1, while the Space Shuttle ranged from about 1:1 at high speed, early in reentry, to 4.5:1 on final approach.</p>

<p>Notably, large transport aircraft tend to have significantly higher L/D ratios than small aircraft: a 747 can achieve an L/D<sub>max</sub> of about 17:1. With an altitude of 33,000 feet (~10,000 meters) that would mean a gliding distance of 100 miles (~170 Km).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What governs the 'glideability' of the plane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As above, its lift-to-drag ratio. Very casually speaking this is just a measure of how ""aerodynamic"" the airplane is, comparing its capability to generate lift with the drag it creates in the process. The better its lifting capabilities, or the less drag it generates, the higher the ratio.</p>

<p>For more information, I highly recommend a free online book on aerodynamics called <strong><a href=""http://www.av8n.com/how/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">See How It Flies</a></strong> by John Denker. It is written for pilots, not mathematicians or physicists, so it explains the concepts very intuitively without a lot of equations. It talks about L/D ratio and explains some of the factors that affect it. (I would recommend this book to any pilot anyway.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible, for an airplane with an engine/engines, to leverage this to save fuel while flying, or are they too heavy/otherwise unable to do this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since glide ratio is directly related to (indeed it's the same thing as) L/D ratio, you could say that airplanes already do take advantage of it. The higher their L/D at cruise airspeed, the more fuel-efficient they will be (because less thrust will be required to counteract drag in steady-state flight).</p>

<p>For example, if the pilots see a large flock of birds at some distance in front of the airplane, and they want to reduce speed suddenly. What will happen if an airplane doesn't have such brake?</p>
","<p>An airplane can slow down and reduce its speed while in flight. The easiest way to do so is to reduce the amount of thrust that the engines are producing. This will produce an almost immediate reduction of the airspeed, especially if the plane is maintaining the same altitude. </p>

<p>There are also devices called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_(aeronautics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">air brakes</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(aeronautics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spoilers</a> that can be further used to reduce speed.

<p>If an airplane reduces its speed too much, it will of course stall and start dropping precipitously, at which time the airspeed usually also increases again.

"Why is water in the fuel tank bad?","34279","","<p>I mean, on the one hand it seems kind of obvious, if you had a fuel tank that was mostly water then you would lack combustible materials for the engine, but I get the impression that having any water in the fuel tank at all is considered a really bad idea.</p>

<p>Why is that?  Is it all right to have a very small amount of water in the fuel tanks?  Is there a defined percentage of liquid in the fuel tank that must be fuel in order to operate safely? (say 99.87% or something?)  And does this differ from prop to turboprop to turbofan to jet?</p>
","<p>Fuel systems are in general fed by gravity, at least until the fuel leaves the tank, where sometimes (always if the tank is lower than the engine) a pump pushes it toward the engine. This means that fuel is generally extracted from the bottom of the tank (or slightly above the very bottom to avoid having small particles from the bottom of the tank clogging up the fuel filter, incidentally this also introduces the concept of <code>unusable fuel</code>, as the stuff remaining at the bottom of the tank, although there are a lot more factors to this).</p>

<p>Fuel is less dense than water, meaning it'll float on top of the water. Or if you want to think of it the other way around, water is heavier and will sink to the bottom, right where you're trying to get your fuel to feed to the engine. Water doesn't burn very well and the engine will stop. Avgas is generally 0.72 kg/l and Jetfuel around 0.82 kg/l (water being 1 kg/l, see have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"" rel=""nofollow"">SI</a> units work well that way?).</p>

<p>A tiny amount of water probably mix with the fuel and simply reduce the power output slightly, whereas anything more will be drained from the tank first, and it'll be very hard to restart the engine. You'd have to pump all the water through the cylinder and out the exhaust, and I don't think this is generally possible in flight, especially right after takeoff which is generally the case when you have water in the fuel (could be right after switching tanks too though).</p>

<p>I don't know much about turbine engines, but I suspect they're less susceptible as the water will not prevent relighting the engine (the pumps will simply push the water out, there's no cylinder that could fill up with water), and you'll generally be using up more fuel on the ground making the problem readily apparent. This is pure speculation though.</p>

  <p>b. Model Aircraft Hazards in the NAS. While aero-modelers generally are concerned about safety and exercise good judgment when flying model aircraft for the hobby and recreational purposes for which they are intended, they may share the airspace in which manned aircraft are operating. Unmanned aircraft, including model aircraft, may pose a hazard to manned aircraft in flight and to persons and property on the surface if not operated safely. Model aircraft operations that endanger the safety of the National Airspace System, particularly careless or reckless operations or those that interfere with or fail to give way to any manned aircraft may be subject to FAA enforcement action.</p>
  
  <p>c. Determination of “Model Aircraft” Status. Whether a given unmanned aircraft operation may be considered a “model aircraft operation” is determined with reference to section 336 of Public Law 112-95:</p>
  
  <p>(1) The aircraft is flown strictly for hobby or recreational use;</p>
  
  <p>(2) The aircraft operates in accordance with a community-based set of safety guidelines and within the programming of a nationwide community-based organization (CBO);</p>
  
  <p>(3) The aircraft is limited to not more than 55 pounds, unless otherwise certified through a design, construction, inspection, flight test, and operational safety program administered by a CBO;</p>
  
  <p>(4) The aircraft operates in a manner that does not interfere with, and gives way to, any manned aircraft; and</p>
  
  <p>(5) When flown within 5 miles of an airport, the operator of the model aircraft provides the airport operator and the airport air traffic control tower (when an air traffic facility is located at the airport) with prior notice of the operation. Model aircraft operators flying from a permanent location within 5 miles of an airport should establish a mutually agreed upon operating procedure with the airport operator and the airport air traffic control tower (when an air traffic facility is located at the
  airport).</p>
  
  <p>d. Public Law 112-95 recognizes the authority of the Administrator to pursue enforcement action against persons operating model aircraft who endanger the safety of the National Airspace System. Accordingly, model aircraft operators must comply with any Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR).</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Model aircraft must not operate in Prohibited Areas, Special Flight Rule Areas or, the Washington National Capital Region Flight Restricted Zone, without specific authorization.</p>
  
  <p>e. Model aircraft operators should follow best practices including limiting operations to 400 feet above ground level (AGL).</p>
  
  <p>f. All other operators and for additional information on Unmanned Aircraft Systems please visit: <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/uas/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.faa.gov/uas/</a> .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this is ""guidance"" and recommended procedures that the FAA ""encourages voluntary compliance with"" in order to ""reduce the potential for hazards and create a good neighbor environment with affected communities and airspace users.""</p>

<p>That being said, any city/county/state could have rules on their books, but there is not national guidance for this.</p>

<p>The high-pressure turbine is, with the combustion chamber, very hot (more than the exhaust nozzle). You may read this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade"">Wikipedia article</a> which has a short list of materials used for turbine blades (with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade#List_of_turbine_blade_materials"">alloys names</a> and cooling techniques).</p>

<sup>(source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan"">Wikipedia</a>)</sup></p>

<p>(To understand temperatures and pressures, remember the fan pushes about one ton of air per second in high power turbofans.)</p>

<p>All quotes are from <a href=""http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ANASAGUIDETOENGINES%5B1%5D.pdf"">Nasa Guide To Engines</a>, 2007, except stated otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1903, the Wright brothers built an aluminum
  block engine because of its light weight compared to cast iron. Its
  melting point of 660 °C was well above the engine’s operating
  temperature, so for them it was a good choice. However, aluminum could
  not be used in the hotter parts of a turbine engine where temperatures
  reach of 1800 °C or more because it would melt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fan</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This typically does
  not get very hot (&lt;150 °C) so aluminum, titanium, or stainless steel
  are all suitable for the fan blades. Most engines use titanium because
  it has a high strength-to-weight ratio, is corrosion and fatigue
  resistant, and would be able to withstand the impact of a bird strike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Compressor section</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pressure of the air can be raised up to 30 times and the
  temperature, depending on the number of stages in the compressor, can
  rise to 1000 °C. Here the materials must have high strength at high
  temperatures; must resist fatigue, cracking, and oxidation; and also
  must resist “creep.” Creep is the tendency of a material to slowly
  change shape when stressed at high temperature. Since no single metal
  would have all the desired properties, an alloy (a mixture of metals)
  is used. Very high- temperature alloys are called superalloys and are
  generally nickel-, cobalt-, or iron-based alloys. Aluminum and/or
  titanium are added for strength, and chromium, as well as rare earth
  elements like yttrium, are added to improve corrosion resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Combustion chamber</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temperatures can exceed 1800 °C and again superalloys are used, but
  without the titanium or aluminum for strength because there are no
  moving parts. Instead, refractory metals are often added to a
  superalloy. These are metals of unusually high resistance to heat,
  corrosion, and wear such as tungsten, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum,
  and rhenium. They are used in alloys and not as pure metals because
  they are among the densest of all the elements, a negative property
  when it comes to aircraft that need to keep weight to a minimum.
  Ceramics and ceramic-metal mixes are also used here because of their
  high heat resistance. We are familiar with pottery, tile, crucibles,
  and fire bricks as types of ceramics. They have very high melting
  points and don’t require the cooling systems like those needed to keep
  metals from melting so they make for lighter, less complicated engine
  parts. The down side is that they tend to fracture under stress, so
  engineers seek to create new ceramics composites that incorporate
  other materials to improve properties.</p>

<p><strong>Turbine</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKcxt.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKcxt.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>High-pressure turbine blade (source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Components_of_jet_engines"">Wikipedia</a>)</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first set of turbine blades are in the highest pressure, hottest
  part of the gas flow and are generally made of nickel-based superalloy
  or ceramic blades. Unheated outside air is circulated through channels
  inside of the turbine blades to keep them from melting in this extreme
  environment. Further down the engine lower pressure turbine blades
  often sit. Since the gases have somewhat cooled by this point, the
  blades can be made of iron-based superalloy or even stainless steel.
  It is interesting to note that for strength, the metals used for
  turbine blades are often grown as a single crystal. A close look at
  most metals and alloys show that they are composed of crystals (also
  called “grains”), and the places where the crystals meet are called
  grain boundaries. A material is weaker at the grain boundaries than
  within the grains—especially at high temperatures— so turbine blades
  fashioned from metal formed as a single grain (no boundaries) are
  stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Casing</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although it need not withstand high temperatures like the core of the

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, because of the limitations of older navigation systems, none of the polar routes we fly crosses exactly over the North Pole. At the Pole, an airplane’s compass changes from a due-north heading to due south, and that change of course could potentially lead to problems with ­earlier-generation autopilot systems. Fortunately, that is not an issue with the latest generation of long-haul aircraft, such as the Boeing 777s we fly, whose source of navigation is the extremely precise Global Positioning System (GPS). Nonetheless, to make polar flying equally effortless for both the new generation and the previous generations of aircraft, <strong>none of the approved civil polar routes comes closer than about 60 nautical miles from the Pole</strong>.</p>

"If my parachute fails to open, why should I aim for land rather than water?","33335","","<p>I was watching these 'what if' parachute failure videos on YouTube and everywhere they say do not choose water over land. Why should we not choose water and what happens if we land in water? </p>

<p>One such video: <div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

","<p>If your parachute fails to open entirely you are almost certainly extremely dead no matter where you land, however occasionally people do survive. A partial failure of a chute is much more survivable. You will be coming down much faster than you would with a good chute, and you are going to get injured, probably badly. Think broken legs and arms with neck or back trauma. You may sustain a concussion as well, and you will certainly go into shock. </p>

<p>If you come down in the water you will be injured <strong>and</strong> unable to keep yourself afloat, and it will be much harder to rescue you. On land help will be much closer and, and as <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/45507/if-my-parachute-fails-to-open-why-should-i-aim-for-land-rather-than-water#comment117552_45507"">@RonBeyer says in comments</a>, you can't drown on land. </p>

<p>Land has features which may help you survive: trees, vegetation, hay bales, crops, snow, and many other things may cushion your impact enough to make the difference between life and death. Water is the same wherever you go, and doesn't have nearly enough give to cushion an impact. </p>

"What materials are plane windows made of?","33153","","<p>I've always wondered, what are those dual-layered (bonus: sometimes they have a little &lt;2mm hole, why is it there?) windows commercial jets put next to their seats made of?</p>
","<p>Generally aircraft windows are made of what we colloquially call ""plexiglass"" of some kind (Lexan polycarbonate is common in light General Aviation aircraft, acrylic plastics are also used).  This material is light, relatively strong (not shatter-proof, but it'll take a moderate beating) and has decent optical properties.<br>
Its major drawback is ""crazing"" -- hairline cracks on the surface of the material that form over time from dirt, stress, temperature, UV exposure, and the like.</p>

<hr>

<p>Bonus answer: The little hole serves a couple of purposes, but the biggie is pressure relief/equalization. <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/170548/"">This gets discussed over on airliners.net a lot</a> and they've covered it pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>Basically the hole ensures that the cabin pressure is pushing against the outer (primary, usually thicker) sheet of plexiglass, which is plug-wedged into the fuselage structure and can't go anywhere.<br>
Should the outer pane be damaged the hole will also theoretically bleed cabin pressure off at a controlled rate - though how successful that equalization is would depend on your altitude (and thus the pressure differential between the cabin and the outside air) and the degree of damage to the outer pane.</p>

"What is the difference between ""flight level"" and ""altitude""?","32673","","<p>I have seen references to ""FL180"" and ""FL300"", and I know that they stand for Flight Level 180 and Flight Level 300. I've also seen references to ""an altitude of 18000ft"" or ""an altitude of 30000ft"".</p>

<p>What is the difference between <em>flight level</em> and <em>altitude</em>, how do they relate to each other, and when and why would one be used instead of the other?</p>
","<p>Flight levels use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_altitude"" rel=""noreferrer"">QNE</a> or pressure altitude, while altitude references <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNH"" rel=""noreferrer"">QNH</a> or local pressure adjusted to sea level pressure.  Altitudes are used at low levels and flight levels at higher levels.  The transition between altitudes and flight levels differs by country and is generally just above the highest obstacle in that country.  In the US the transition altitude/level is 18,000' / FL180.  Some countries transition as low as 5000' / FL050 and the transition altitude/level may vary from airport to airport.  </p>

<p>In the altitudes knowing accurate elevations relative to the ground and obstacles is important for collision avoidance and this is the reason QNH is used here.  Each airport will report QNH and controllers will issue the current QNH as needed.  You need to know the QNH for obstacle / terrain avoidance but you need to be using the same QNH as those around you for aircraft vertical separation.</p>

<p>Above all terrain/obstacles the only thing we care about is vertical separation, so we no longer need to know about the actual pressure and instead use a standard reference pressure, QNE / 1013.25 hPa / 29.92"" Hg.  </p>

<p>Note that flight levels drop the last two zeros of the corresponding altitude and so 30,000 is FL300, not FL30000.  When checking in with a controller, FL300 would be pronounced <code>flight level tree zero zero</code>. </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that an altimeter cannot actually determine altitude.  It can only determine pressure (technically local static pressure compared to a reference pressure).  It converts this pressure to an altitude using a calibrated non-linear scale.  To illustrate the point, look at this map of 500 mb heights:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbYKc.gif"" alt=""US Map of 500 mb Geopotential Height""></p>

<p>500 mb correlates to 5500 m or 18,000 ft in a standard atmosphere.  In a real atmosphere this height varies and is not actually level.  An airplane flying ""level"" at FL180 from LAX to NYC last night will have actually descended almost 300 m while indicating a constant altitude.  These deviations in true altitude from indicated altitude are acceptable, however, since they effect everyone equally in the same locality and separation is maintained.  </p>

","<p>Well, it does look pretty, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Boeing wanted to reduce the noise generated because of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_blast"">jet blast</a> of the engines. Many airports around the world are implementing new noise regulations.</p>

<p>As <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2005/december/ts_sf07.html"">mentioned by Boeing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To combat the sound of jet-blast from the rear of the engine, Boeing,
  General Electric, and NASA developed serrated edges called chevrons
  for the back of the nacelle and the engine exhaust nozzle. The
  chevrons reduce jet blast noise by controlling the way the air mixes
  after passing through and around the engine.</p>
  
  <p>The acoustic liners and chevrons are such effective noise suppressors
  that several hundred pounds of sound insulation may be eliminated from
  the fuselage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As NASA was involved, <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/bridges_chevron_events_prt.htm"">they state</a> <em>(my paraphrasing)</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chevrons are the sawtooth pattern seen on the trailing edges of some
  jet engine nozzles. <strong>As hot air from the engine core mixes with cooler
  air blowing through the engine fan, the shaped edges serve to smooth
  the mixing, which reduces turbulence that creates noise.</strong></p>
  
  <p>... The new Boeing 787 is among the most modern jets relying on
  chevrons to reduce engine noise levels. It sports chevrons on the
  nacelles, or fan housings.</p>

","<p>There are two main systems of aircraft type designations: IATA and ICAO codes. The ones you mention are IATA codes (all 3-character) and are often used for shortened aircraft type designation in public information.</p>

<p>Both code types are <a href=""http://www.airlinecodes.co.uk/arctypes.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">listed here with the corresponding full aircraft types</a>. As you can see, the IATA information covers the type and variant, including some features such as winglets, but not necessarily extended range models or sub-variants with different engines. It also differentiates between freighters and passenger versions. </p>

<p>Despite the additional digit, ICAO codes are less precise and often include several variants such as freighter as well as passenger variants of the same type.</p>

<p>The codes given in your question translate to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>733</strong>  - Boeing <strong>73</strong>7-<strong>3</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>734</strong>  - Boeing <strong>73</strong>7-<strong>4</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>735</strong>  - Boeing <strong>73</strong>7-<strong>5</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>738</strong>  - Boeing <strong>73</strong>7-<strong>8</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>73G</strong>  - Boeing <strong>73</strong>7-<strong>7</strong>00 (7th letter of the alphabet)</li>
<li><strong>73H</strong>  - Boeing <strong>73</strong>7-<strong>8</strong>00 with winglets (8th letter of the alphabet)</li>
<li><strong>762</strong>  - Boeing <strong>76</strong>7-<strong>2</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>763</strong>  - Boeing <strong>76</strong>7-<strong>3</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>772</strong>  - Boeing <strong>77</strong>7-<strong>2</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>773</strong>  - Boeing <strong>77</strong>7-<strong>3</strong>00</li>
<li><strong>777</strong>  - ambiguous <strong>777</strong> type</li>
</ul>

<p>(all passenger aircraft)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as @Ralph J mentions, it's not always clear which type of code is used. Mostly, a 4-digit-code will be an ICAO code and a 3-character-code will use the IATA system, but because some ICAO codes only contain 3 digits, this isn't always reliable. For example, if you read ""DC6"", it could be the IATA code and refer to the passenger version, or it could be the ICAO code and you wouldn't know if it refers to the passenger or the freighter version.</p>

"Why is the air traffic control profession so commonly perceived as ""stressful""?","30549","","<p>In my experience, almost every time the topic of air traffic control (as a career) comes up in conversation, someone makes a remark like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Air traffic control - isn't that a very stressful job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that this point could be debated, surely there are many other ""stressful"" jobs which don't receive this kind of response.</p>

<p>My question is this: <em>How did the ""stressful"" air traffic control job become such a common perception?</em></p>
","<p>Some very spot-on comments, some comments that are totally ignorant of the job. I am a retired ATC, 32 years.  I worked at one of the world's busiest and most complex US facilities (as described by many independent sources).</p>

<p>Have you ever:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heard a family on the other end of the radio screaming just moments before they were obliterated in the air by a military fighter flying VFR? </li>
<li>Tried in vain to find a way to contact the occupants of Payne Stewart's jet only to watch helplessly as it finally crashes after several hours of flight?</li>
<li>Had 30+ airliners in your sector which happens to be dotted with Level 5 thunderstorms?  The amount of airspace you now have has decreased substantially and the aircraft all need to deviate. They all want to either go in different directions, or they all want to head towards the few clear spots left. You sit there for 2 hours directing aircraft to basically thread a needle at 500mph and pulling out every trick in your book to ensure that there is enough space to ensure all 30+ aircraft (and more, because those aircraft never stop coming) make it through your airspace without encountering the dangers of severe weather or coming into physical contact with another aircraft. Aircraft that are often executing movements that they don't have clearance for, which requires quick and accurate reaction from the controller.</li>
<li>Dealt with one of the times when a corporate jet ""flames out"" at 43,000 feet and immediately descends through a dozen or more jets flying the same path, requiring the controller to immediately clear all of those aircraft out of the path of that corporate jet.</li>
<li>Had a small twin prop lose all electronics and be unable to navigate properly while in a thick cloud layer.  His portable radio is not working properly, so radio communications must be short and accurate. (Remember, you have another sector full of aircraft that you are also providing services to). Finally, his portable radio fail.  Right before that, you ask the pilot if he has a cell phone. He does.  You give him a phone number and you and he are able to communicate via telephone to finally guide him to a safe landing at Newport News Airport.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could write a book about many specific events that controllers have experienced.  The ""pucker factor"" events.</p>

<p>But the real stress is the long term chronic stress that the job presents.
Certainly, there are facilities that are both low traffic and have uncomplicated operations. If you are lucky enough to work at one of these (and willing to accept the low end of the pay scale) then stress is probably much lower and stressful events infrequent.  But for the majority of controllers (who work at a number of very high traffic facilities; air traffic in the US is higher and more complicated than the next 29 countries' air traffic, combined) the stress is a chronic, continuous level (not the big adrenalin-pumping situations) from being attached to your position for several hours, trying to maintain a constant ""big picture"", maintaining situational awareness, issuing control instructions to ensure that SAFETY is always the first product of your efforts.  Many, if not most, controllers will most likely retire with high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep disorders, etc. that despite best efforts to exercise and live a healthy lifestyle will probably affect a controller for the remainder of their life.</p>

<p>Certainly, other jobs are stressful, and I would never try to compare one as ""more stressful"" than the other.  The top ones are all stressful.  But those that try to downplay the stress of air traffic control would only need to visit a busy air traffic control facility for a day and they would see and probably feel the stress themselves.</p>

<p>I have a very good friend that is an FBI field agent in Washington, DC.  He has worked on some very high-profile cases.  We were talking one day and he said something about the stress of air traffic control.  I chuckled saying that at least I wasn't being faced by some of the most dangerous people in the country. But his response was that in his job they have detailed plans for what they do.  His raids were in the middle of the night when these people were asleep and unsuspecting.  He had a well-trained team that each had specific responsibilities.  They had plenty of firepower and protective equipment.  He said that most of his operations were quite easy and they experienced little resistance. He did have moments of intensity, but he (who had visited an air traffic facility) did not think the stress he experienced was anywhere near to what he saw at the air traffic control facility.</p>

<p>But I still would not want to be a law enforcement officer, nor a school teacher for that matter!  My personality was a good match for the job of air traffic control.  But now that I am retired, I take blood pressure medicine, am borderline diabetic despite a regular exercise program and am within a healthy weight and eat very healthy.  I also still have sleep apnea and other sleep issues that I see a sleep doctor several times a year for.  All of my present health issues, which are well-controlled, are according to the doctors a direct effect of the stresses of being an air traffic controller.</p>

<p>Air traffic control IS stressful.  Is it more stressful than other jobs? I doubt it. And to argue about whose job is more stressful is a silly exercise. The trick is having a personality that meshes with the job.  If you are in a job that is not a good match, that is stressful.</p>

"How do aircraft keep fuel from freezing while in flight?","30517","","<p>On aircraft which fly above 30,000 feet, the temperature can often can get to temperatures below Jet-A's freezing point. </p>

<p>For example: at 36,000 feet the standard outside air temperature is -56.5°C (-69.7°F) and is well below Jet-A's freezing point of -40°C/F. </p>

<p>What measures are put in place on aircraft to mitigate the risk of the fuel in the tanks freezing and preventing the engines from operating?</p>
","<p>Much like water, exposing fuel to below freezing temperatures does not instantly make it freeze.  It takes some amount of time, and as long as the fuel is not exposed to below freezing temperatures long enough to make it freeze, it won't be a problem.</p>

<p>How much time?  That depends on a number of factors like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Type of fuel</strong>

<ul>
<li>Jet A (common in the US) has a freezing point of -40 C</li>
<li>Jet A1 (common outside the US) has a freezing point of -47 C</li>
<li>Jet B (common for some military aircraft and very cold airports) has a freezing point of -60 C</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Initial fuel temperature</strong>

<ul>
<li>If you fuel in the middle east during the middle of summer, the fuel will be a lot warmer than when you fuel in Siberia in the middle of winter.  Warmer fuel will take longer to freeze.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outside air temperature</strong>

<ul>
<li>Much like trying to freeze water to form an ice cube, the colder the air around it, the faster that it will freeze.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aircraft speed</strong>

<ul>
<li>The faster that the airplane goes, the more friction there is as the air flows over the wing.  This heats up the air close to the wing and makes it take longer for the fuel to freeze (see previous point).  The temperature at the wing is known as TAT:</li>
<li>For example, at an actual temperature of -56.5 C (SAT) and Mach 0.72 the TAT is -34 C, but at Mach 0.80 the TAT is -29 C.</li>
<li>For more information about SAT -vs- TAT, see my answer about <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/1796/69"">Air Data Computers</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quantity of fuel</strong> 

<ul>
<li>Much like a small pond will freeze before a large lake, in order to get fuel to freeze you need to lower the temperature of all of it.  </li>
<li>The more that there is, the longer it will take.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aircraft design</strong>

<ul>
<li>Some aircraft run hydraulic lines close to the fuel so that the heat will help slow down the freezing.</li>
<li>Some aircraft constantly pump fuel to keep it moving and mixing if it tends to freeze in one part of the tank before the rest</li>
<li>Some aircraft use fuel to cool the engine oil using a heat exchanger, and return the warmed fuel to the tanks</li>
<li>Many other design factors</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, fuel will not freeze in the typical amount of time that an aircraft is aloft.  If particular routes pose a problem, there are several options that the operator and pilot have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a fuel with a lower freezing point</li>
<li>Fly at a lower altitude where it is not as cold</li>
<li>Choose a route with warmer temperatures</li>
<li>Increase the speed of the airplane</li>
<li>Carry extra fuel</li>
<li>Transfer fuel in a way to keep fuel warmer.  Typically this is done by transferring fuel from the relatively warm fuselage tanks to the wing tanks which are exposed to more of the cold air.</li>

"Why does the US President fly in an obsolete 747-200?","30504","","<p>The Boeing VC-25A (""Air Force One"") is a heavily modified 747-200. The two current airframes (SAM 28000 and 29000) were put into duty in 1990 and are slated to be replaced in 2017, although I suspect that latter date is optimistic. </p>

<p>These two 747-200s are among the last remaining 747-200s in service. I suspect that they are the best-maintained 747-200s in the world and they have considerable sunk costs in their custom rigging, but even when the aircraft were put in service in 1990 their model had already been replaced by the 747-300 (1982) and 747-400 (1989).</p>

<p>Why hasn't the VC-25A been replaced to keep up with the times? A 747-400 airframe is lighter, faster, and bigger (let alone a 747-8). These would all seem to be suitable features for what is most probably the most important aircraft in the USAF fleet. Is there some attribute of the 747-200 that makes it particularly well-suited for this role despite its obsolescence in the market?</p>
","<p>The 747-200 derivatives used for transporting the President of the United States are VC-25's operated and maintained by the United States Air Force. The US Air Force tends to keep planes for a long time, as they still operate 707 and B-52 aircraft twice as old as these 747's. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4"">E-4 aircraft</a>, also based on the 747-200, have been in service for 40 years. The reasons for keeping the VC-25 aircraft flying are similar to these other examples.</p>

<p>A lot of work went into the VC-25 aircraft. They have been modified to add aerial refueling capability, defensive mechanisms, and include extensive additional electronic equipment for communications. Installing the special interiors was also a major task. As with a bomber or AWACS, there is a large initial investment in development to design the systems and build the aircraft. Upgrading components and providing proper maintenance allows these aircraft to perform their missions long after their entry into service.</p>

<p>Another difference is the engines. The 747-200B model has GE CF6-50E2 engines producing 52,500 lbf thrust each. The VC-25 aircraft have newer CF6-80C2B1 engines producing 56,700 lbf thrust each, which is the same engine as the 747-300. Newer engines go a long way towards improved performance.</p>

<p>As DeltaLima notes, these aircraft do not spend nearly as much time in the air as commercial aircraft. Yet there are many commercial aircraft in service with similar or greater age, including some 747-200 aircraft.</p>

"What is the purpose of the sharp pods under airliner wings?","30386","","<p>What are the pods with the sharp trailing edges underneath the wings of large airliners, as shown in the image below?
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjH0J.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My best guess would be fuel tanks</p>
","<p>They are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-shock_body"" rel=""noreferrer"">Anti-shock bodies</a>.</p>

<p>In the transsonic speed range (above about Mach 0.7), aircraft drag is governed by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule"" rel=""noreferrer"">Whitcomb area rule</a>, which basically says that to minimize drag, the aircraft cross-sectional area must change as smoothly as possible, independent of its actual shape. It is somewhat counter-intuitive, but well established.</p>

<p>Compare this Junkers patent drawing (via Wikipedia):</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule#mediaviewer/File:Patent_932410_Seite_5.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Patent_932410_Seite_5.gif/220px-Patent_932410_Seite_5.gif"" alt=""Junkers patent drawing""></a></p>

<p>which shows various combinations of positioning engines to adopt the area rule.</p>

<p>For the usual aircraft design the cross-section increases over the engines that hang ahead of the wing leading edge and then the thick part of the wing and wing box (the thicker part of fuselage where wings connect), but the wing tips are too thin and the cross-sectional area would decrease too quickly, so something needs to be attached to the trailing edge to make the reduction of cross-sectional area smoother. The anti-shock bodies are usually conveniently combined with flap actuator and track fairings.</p>

<p>There are however <em>some</em> aircraft that have anti-shock bodies combined with other functions, e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu-134"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tu-134</a> (and many other designs by Tupolev Design Bureau) retracts landing gear in its anti-shock bodies (which are just one large on each side):</p>

"What is the coordinate system used in an Aircraft?","30242","","<p>I know that from nose to tail the aircraft is divided by STA (station). At least for Boeing and Airbus this is the case but I am not familiar with other manufacturers.  However, there is also two other dimensions that give every location of an aircraft an identifiable point location. It's obviously not x,y,z.  What is this coordinate system and approximately what does one unit along each access mean in terms of inches or centimeters?</p>
","<p>Stations (STA), generally Fuselage Stations (FS), designate location along the length of the aircraft, increasing from nose to tail. Generally station 0 is somewhere in front of the airplane. One reason for this is that if the airplane grows longer, there still won't be any negative stations, and sections of the plane keep their station numbers. FS 100 can also be placed at an important location (looks like the firewall below).</p>

<p>Water lines (WL) designate location in the height of the aircraft, from ground up. You can probably guess by now that these are holdovers from the marine industry. Like the stations, water line 0 is generally a bit below the aircraft, possibly to have WL 100 at the center of the fuselage, or WL 0 could be at the bottom of the fuselage.</p>

<p>Butt lines (BL) designate location left/right on the aircraft, generally centered in the middle.</p>

<p>While the main system is based on the whole airplane, different parts (like the wings) have their own system of STA, WL, and BL.</p>

"Is joining the air force a good way to become an airline pilot?","29849","","<p>I've always loved the air force. However, my main goal is to become an airline pilot. Would joining the air force affect becoming a commercial airline pilot?</p>

<p>I am asking because if I join the air force, I am committed to seven years of service. Would this put me behind other pilots? Or, do airlines like pilots with military backgrounds?</p>
","<p>Honestly, every U.S. Air Force pilot I know, who wanted to retire to the airlines, got hired on with no problems.  The ex-Air Force pilots I know have all gotten immediately put into the big planes: A380, 747, 767, 787, etc right from the start.  This is because the airlines know that an ex-military pilot has had some of the best training and experience in high pressure situations. </p>

<p>That being said, in the USA it is very hard to become an Air Force pilot.  You have to contract with the Air Force before they even let you know if you can go to pilot training.  That means, if you don't make the cutoff for pilot training, you have to spend at least 4 years in the Air Force.  If you do make it through Air Force pilot training you have to contract for 10 years after you finish flight school, which means about 12 years from your date of commissioning.  This will take a good 16+ years out of your life, including the time spent in college.  However, you will progress from your first flight all the way to potentially flying F-22s in under two years - a rate of progressing you won't see anywhere else.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, if you don't want to join the military then you shouldn't.  By joining the military you are expected to give your life for people you may not know, or even care about.  That aside, there's no point in spending a minimum of 16 years doing something you don't like, or fighting for a cause you don't support just to become an airline pilot.  If you can find a good airline cadet program, or scholarship, you can become a great airline pilot, it will just take a longer time to progress from one aircraft to another.</p>

<p>Just a little tangent.  That being said, I'm currently an AFROTC cadet, and I had no military background.  I love AFROTC, the US Air Force, and the USA.  I'm currently applying for a pilot slot in the U.S. Air Force, but if I don't make it I would be vary happy taking other jobs, too.  The key is to have small, achievable goals that you can take one step at a time.  </p>

<li>Rectangular</li>
<li>Eliptical</li>
<li>Tapered</li>
<li>Sweptback</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are more. What are the different types of planform out there?</p>

<p>Each must have its own advantages and disadvantages. What are those?</p>

<p>What's a good example of each?</p>
","<p>The wing planform (which is the shape and layout of wing) for each aircraft is mainly based on the aerodynamic requirements. There are other considerations like stealth, controllability etc. The basic terminology in the wing geometry is given in the figure below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZbSP.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZbSP.gif"" alt=""Wing Geometry""></a>
<br><sup>Source: grc.nasa.gov</sup></p>

<p>Most of the wing platforms in use (or have been used) fall under one of these categories. </p>

<p><strong>Elliptical</strong> Aerodynamically, the elliptical planform is the most efficient as elliptical spanwise lift distribution has the lowest possible induced drag (as given by thin airfoil theory). However, the most important disadvantage of the elliptical wing is that its manufacturability is poor.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous aircraft with elliptical planform is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire"" rel=""noreferrer"">Supermarine Spitfire</a>, used in Battle of Britan.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the elliptical wing was not decided to minimize induced drag, but to house the retractable landing gear along with guns and ammunition inside a wing that had to be thin. As per designer Beverly Shenstone,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ellipse was simply the shape that allowed us the thinnest possible wing with room inside to carry the necessary structure and the things we wanted to cram in. And it looked nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some aircraft like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seversky_P-35"" rel=""noreferrer"">Seversky P-35</a> had a semi elliptical wing, with only the leading or trailing edge elliptical.</p>

<p><strong>Rectangular</strong> Arguably the simplest wing planform from a manufacturing point of view, the rectangular wing is a straight, untapered wing. A good example would be the light general aircraft like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-38_Tomahawk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Piper PA 38</a>.</p>

Licensed under Public Domain via <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Commons</a>.</sup></p>

<p>The main disadvantage of this wing is that it is aerodynamically inefficient.</p>

<p><strong>Tapered Wing</strong> This is a modification of the rectangular wing where the chord is varied across the span to approximate the elliptical lift distribution. While not as efficient as the elliptical lift distribution, it offers a compromise between manufacturability and efficiency.</p>

<p>A very good example of aircraft using this type of wing is the North American <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang"" rel=""noreferrer"">P-51 Mustang</a>, which became the premier USAAF escort fighter against the Luftwaffe.</p>

<p><strong>Constant Chord with Tapered Outer</strong> This is midway between the rectangular and the tapered wing, with the inner part having constant chord and the outer part having a taper.</p>

<p>Almost all of the wings seen so far are used in subsonic aircraft due to the large drag caused by them in the transonic regime. Most of the wings used in supersonic aircraft fall under one of the following categories.</p>

<p><strong>Delta</strong> The delta is a very low aspect ratio wing used in supersonic aircraft, most notably in the European designs. The main advantages of the delta wing is that is efficient in all the flight regimes (subsonic, transonic and supersonic). Also, the wing offers a large wing area for the shape, reducing wing loading and improving maneuverability.</p>

<p>The delta wing design is also very strong structurally, offering large volume for internal fuel. The delta wings are also quite simple to build and maintain.</p>

<p>The main disadvantages are that they have high induced drag due to low aspect ratio and also that they should have high angle of attack at low speeds (takeoff and landing), mainly due to fact that at these speeds, lift is generated by vortices. To compensate for this, they have high stall angles.</p>

<p>A very good example for this wing is the Dassault <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_2000"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mirage 2000</a>, which is an example of tailless delta i.e. without horizontal stabilizers.</p>

<p>A variant of the delta wing used in some aircraft is the one with horizontal stabilizer (tailed delta), the most famous of them being the Russian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21</a>.</p>

<p>Another variant is the one used by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eurofighter Typhoon</a>, the so called cropped delta, where the tips of the delta are 'cut off' to reduce drag at high angles of attack. </p>

<p>Yet another variant of the delta wing (this planform is very popular in combat aircraft), is the so called double delta, where the leading edge angle is not constant, but has two different values. One good example of this is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Tejas"" rel=""noreferrer"">Light Combat Aircraft</a> 'Tejas' under development in India.</p>

<p><strong>Trapezoidal</strong> The trapezoidal wing is a high performance configuration such that the leading edge sweeps back and the trailing edge sweeps forward. This is mostly found in combat aircraft from the US. </p>

<p>This wing configuration offers efficient supersonic flight and has very good stealth characteristics. However, the wing loading is quite high, resulting in reduced maneuverability, especially instantaneous turn rate.</p>

<p>This wing configuration is used most notably in the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.</p>

<p><strong>Ogive</strong> The Ogive is a type of supersonic wing used in high speed aircraft. This is a complex mathematical shape derived for minimizing drag, especially at supersonic speeds. They offer excellent supersonic performance, with minimal drag. However, they are extremely complex and manufacturing is difficult while their subsonic performance is poor in comparison.</p>

<p>The most important aircraft using this wing is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde</a>, one of the two supersonic commercial aircraft.</p>

<p>The wing planforms can also be classified on their sweep and variability.</p>

<p><strong>Swept Back wings</strong> The leading edges of these wings are swept back. This is done order to reduce drag in transonic speeds, which is determined by the velocity normal to the wing.</p>

<p>This planform is used in almost all high speed commercial airliners. A good example would be the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boeing 787 Dreamliner</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Swept Forward Wings</strong> One disadvantage of the swept back wings is that due to the flow characteristics, the ailerons stall before the flaps (i.e. outboard wings stall first), which can lead to controllability issues. In order to overcome this, swept forward wings were used  in a few (experimental) aircraft.</p>

<p>The man problem with swept forward wing is that it produces wing twisting as it bends under load, resulting in greater stress on the wing root than for a similar straight or swept back wing. One of the few aircraft to use this wing is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-47"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sukoi Su-47 Berkut</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Variable Sweep Wings</strong> For high speeds (transonic and supersonic), the swept wing is most suitable while for low speed (subsonic) flight, unswept wings are better. Varaible sweep wings were used to optimize the wing planform over a wide range of speeds. The main problem with this type of wing is the mechanical complexity.</p>

<p>Though most of the aircraft have used these planform, a number of other wing shapes have also been tried.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Victor"" rel=""noreferrer"">Handley Page Victor</a> used a Crescent shaped wing. </p>

"Why do planes always land on rear wheels instead of the nose wheels?","29450","","<p>Various times, I have seen and felt myself that the plane always lands on the rear wheels, but not the front wheels. Why do the pilots land it on the rear wheels instead of the front? Does it have some advantage to it or is it a rule?</p>

<p>Is this required for all the planes (irrespective of size, type) to land only on the back wheels?</p>
","<p>Aircraft land on the <strong>main</strong> wheels. For aircraft with nose wheel it is the back ones, but for aircraft with tail wheel (also called “tail-draggers”) it is the front ones. In either case the main wheels are very close to centre of gravity and carry most of the aircraft's weight, the nose or tail wheel only carries a small fraction of it.</p>

<p>The aircraft must land on wheels that are close to the centre of gravity (longitudinally). If they were not, the force on the wheels would create a moment that would violently pitch the aircraft. Actually, tail-draggers tend to bounce on landing a bit because there still is some moment left and in case of tail-draggers it pitches the aircraft up.</p>

<p>Early planes were almost all tail-draggers, because that layout is more robust, handles unpaved runways better and has less drag when the gear is fixed. It however provides poor directional control especially once the tail lifts off the ground during take-off roll. Later most designs started to use nose-wheel, because it provides better directional control, is directionally stable, makes the floor level when the aircraft is standing so loading is easier and visibility during taxi is much better and with invention of retractable landing gear the drag didn't matter any more.</p>

"Why do pilots have the ability to turn off the transponder in-flight?","29439","","<p>These days, when reading news about missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200, I keep coming across a scenario where pilot might have deliberately turned off the transponder which is used for the communication of flight with ATC.</p>

<p>When there is a possibility that any bad thing can happen when pilot turn off transponder, why would one give the ability of turning off the transponder to a pilot when he/she usually depends on instructions from ATC or flight control. Is there anyway that ATC can turn on transponder back from ground?</p>
","<p>Basically everything that consumes power on an aircraft can potentially cause interference, short-circuits, or otherwise jeopardize the safety of flight and therefore must be switchable. Sometimes the switch is in the form a button, otherwise by a fuse. </p>

<p>There are several particular reasons that the transponder can be turned off.</p>

<p>If the transponder malfunctions, it may cause interruptions to all ATC surveillance in an area. There have been occurrences in the past that due to a fault the transponder it was basically acting as a radar jammer. </p>

<p>In one particular incident it took a while before the aircraft that caused it was identified and after requesting the pilot to switch of the transponder, secondary surveillance was restored. </p>

<p>Another reason is that when the aircraft is at the gate, the transponder is switched of to reduce the amount of radio transmissions. 100 aircraft on the surface of a large airport can produce a massive Radio Frequency noise, which negatively affect radar systems. When taxiing, radar replies are useful for aircraft identification, hence the transponder is switched on at push-back or engine start. </p>

<hr>

<p>For an example to see how such requirements are worded in aircraft certification regulations, see rbp's answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>The focus here and in the media<sup>1</sup> on the transponder in relation to hijacks is a red herring. If an aircraft is hijacked, there are way more important things to worry about than an active radar transponder.<br>
If hijackers turn off the transponder it means that they have access to the cockpit already. </p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sub>This answer was written shortly after flight <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370"">MH370</a> went missing while en-route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Initial speculation focussed on a possible hijack scenario.</sub></p>

"Why are Inline Engines more commonly used than Radial Engines?","29422","","<p>Back in the early days of aviation radial engines were very popular, it seemed like all of the big planes of the 20s, 30s and early 40s used them.  But some time during WWII (or so it seems to me) aircraft manufacturers switched from radial engines over to inline engines.</p>

<p>Why was there a switch?  Why do modern manufacturers rarely, if ever, use radial engines?</p>

<p>Example of a Radial Engine for those who are unfamiliar:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9yKP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p><strong>The big advantage of radials at the beginning was their large frontal area</strong>, <strong>which meant they could be air cooled</strong>. An inline air cooled engine can run pretty hot on the rear cylinder. The bigger the engine, the more of an issue cooling becomes. There are some huge air cooled radials, in sizes that would be unthinkable for an air cooled inline engine.</p>

<p><strong>As technology advanced, more complex water cooled engines became more popular</strong>. However <strong>air cooling was still a big advantage in military planes</strong>, due to the absence of a delicate cooling system that could be damaged, enabling radials to persist in this arena. Of course these days no-one would dream of putting a piston engine in a fighter. </p>

<p>Nowadays liquid cooling is almost universal for piston engines in general applications, with small aircraft being one of the few areas where air cooling has managed to hold out to some extent (see below.) In the absence of a military application that prefers air cooling, <strong>the large frontal area has become the radial engine's downfall</strong>, due to the large aerodynamic drag it produces. The other problem is that <strong>the valve gear is quite complicated, which means overhead camshafts and multiple inlet/exhaust valves per cylinder are impractical.</strong> This makes efficiency vs power to weight ratio a big issue as follows: </p>

<p>For an engine to have good power to weight ratio it must run at high RPM. To run at high RPM it must breathe effectively. To do this with just two valves they have to open wide. To stop them colliding with the piston, the compression ratio must be low, which limits efficiency. Hence most modern engines have more than two valves per cylinder to get around this problem.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_engine"">Excellent animation of the valve gear</a>, which also tends to illustrate the difficulty of putting more than 2 valves on a cylinder. Also, lots of history (obviously.)</p>

<p>In World War II both Double Wasps (46L air cooled radial) and Merlins (27L water cooled V, licensed from Rolls Royce in Britain and built locally by Packard) were used by the American military. I once read a very good authentic World War II discussion about the tactics of when to use air cooled radial fighters and when to use water cooled ones. Unfortunately I can't find it. <a href=""http://www.ww2aircraft.net/forum/aviation/radial-vs-liquid-cooled-engines-33738.html"">Here's one of the many discussions on the subject.</a> Note that the Merlin had overhead camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder, like modern engines, whereas the Double Wasp obviously did not.</p>

<p><strong>Modern air cooled engines</strong></p>

<p>I am more of an engine guy than a plane guy, but I've just been looking at modern air cooled aviation engines. They are only available in much smaller sizes than typical WWII fighter engines. Typically they have 4-6 cylinders, too few for a radial, but enough to cause cooling problems on the rear cylinder in an inline.</p>

<p>The compromise is a flat (boxer) engine with 2 or 3 cylinders on each side. This also overcomes two other problems with radials: upper cylinders obstructing pilot view and oil collecting in the lower cylinder when stopped. You also have at least one of these problems with an inline, depending if you mount it upright or inverted.</p>

<p>Small aero engines can be either water cooled or air cooled. The designer has to ask: given the issue of reliability in aviation, does the weekend pilot really want an engine as complicated as the one in his car, with water cooling, cambelts and engine management, all of which could go wrong?</p>

<p>The air cooled engines I've seen (Lycoming) do only have two valves per cylinder, all driven from a common camshaft. (A simpler choice than the cam ring on a radial) I haven't seen an air cooled flat engine with overhead cams and multiple valves per cylinder, but it would be easier achieve than doing the same thing on a radial.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the yaw damper?</li>

<li>Is it ever required for certification or operation?</li>
<li>How does it work?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_damper"">yaw damper</a></strong> is, in simplest terms, an ""autopilot"" for yaw. When engaged, it operates the rudder (or whatever yaw control method is available in exotic aircraft, like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit#Flight_controls"">B-2 flying wing</a>).</p>

<p>Its primary goal is to counteract the typical <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_roll"">Dutch roll</a> aerodynamic mode of many aircraft. It also helps keep turns <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_flight"">coordinated</a> by automatically providing the necessary rudder inputs to avoid <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideslip_angle"">slipping/skidding</a> in a  turn.</p>

<p>In normal aircraft the yaw damper <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot#Stability_augmentation_systems"">is part of the automatic flight control system (AFCS)</a> or ""autopilot."" It can usually be engaged on its own without the rest of the autopilot. On the other hand, most autopilots require the yaw damper to be engaged when the rest of the autopilot is engaged (you can have yaw damper without autopilot, but not autopilot without yaw damper).</p>

<p>For large / transport aircraft, the yaw damper is usually engaged throughout the entire flight profile except for takeoff and landing.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/part-25/subpart-B"">It is required equipment</a> (link is to FAA certification regs but similar regs apply elsewhere) in many (most?) transport aircraft, which tend to suffer Dutch roll instability, but flights can sometimes still be made if the yaw damper is inoperable per the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_minimum_equipment_list"">minimum equipment list (MEL)</a>, with restrictions. This depends on the exact aircraft type and any extra operator policies (company rules). Note that usually an inoperable yaw damper also precludes the use of the rest of the autopilot.</p>

<p>Modern digital yaw dampers are part of an integrated digital autopilot system. They use accelerometers and rate sensors to determine the aircraft's motion. It then runs the numbers through special algorithms to determine what rudder inputs need to be made in order to damp any Dutch roll and to coordinate a turn. It then provides those rudder commands to a servo or hydraulic system which operates the rudder.</p>

"Can a fighter jet be stolen?","28491","","<p>What (if any) sort of pilot authentication systems do fighter jets have?</p>

","<p>Military aircraft rarely have any sort of keys or any sort of authentication systems, they rely on physical security measures to prevent people from getting to the airplanes in the first place, like fences, dogs, cameras, guards, and of course guns. </p>

<p>If there were no physical barriers then you have 3 major barriers to being able to steal a fighter jet:</p>

<ol>
<li>Support: just about every military fighter aircraft has an assigned crew to prepare it for flight and help the pilot(s) get in it. Without this crew you'd have to get the airplane powered up, fueled up, and then you'd have to figure out how to get into it and get the ladder removed. There's a lot of knowledge you'd need to do all this, just knowing how to open the canopy isn't going to be immediately obvious</li>
<li>Starting: starting up a fighter isn't like starting a car, you don't hit a button and everything happens for you, there's fuel tanks and pumps, hydraulic systems, electrical systems, and engine management. You'd have to know where to find all of the switches, dials and levers, and the sequence in which to use them. This isn't something you'd be able to guess, you'd need knowledge of the particular airplane</li>
<li>Flying: high performance jets are challenging to fly, and by flying I mean aviating, navigating, and communicating. Although modern fighters have a lot of computers to help out with this the systems require a great deal of training to use, and if you don't know exactly what you are doing you are most likely going to dig a big hole in the ground </li>
</ol>

<p>If you know how to start and fly the airplane there's nothing stopping you from doing it, provided you can solve the problems of prepping and getting in the airplane. In fact, it's been done when pilots defect with their airplanes, see the comments below for some great examples. </p>

In particular, the SMOH and SFOH acronyms are thrown around a lot for used aircraft.  What are the differences between these acronyms, and what are their purpose for a potential airplane buyer?</p>
","<p>With many airplanes the longevity of the engine is a major factor in the price of the aircraft. Piston aircraft engines are generally good for 2000 hours of operation before they need to be overhauled, which is almost always painfully expensive. The more life left on the engine the higher the value of the airplane. SMOH and SFOH both have to do with the time since the engine was overhauled, both are in hours:</p>

<ul>
<li>SFOH = Since Factory Overhaul</li>
<li>SMOH = Since Major Overhaul</li>
</ul>

<p>A factory overhaul means that the engine was sent back to the manufacturer for its overhaul, where a major overhaul could be done by anyone. In general factory overhauls are consistently good whereas non-factory overhauls vary more in quality. Factory overhauls are more expensive as a result. </p>

<p>If you see an airplane that has 300 hours since overhaul then there's plenty of life left, if you see one that has 1700 hours on the clock you know you are going to have to fork out a lot of cash much sooner, but you can get the airplane much cheaper. </p>

"Why are the cockpit controls of airplanes so complicated?","28180","","<p>For a layman like myself, the cockpit of every single modern airplane that I've laid my eyes on seems like a complex, intimidating mess with knobs, buttons, screens and levers literally covering every single square centimeter. Every time when seeing this, from my point of view, chaos of control surfaces and indicators, I'm always thinking to myself ""This HAS to be possible to make easier!""</p>

<p>Maybe my intuition is correct. Maybe it isn't. Anyhow, I can see a lot of possible reasons why one actually would want cockpits to be designed in this way. Maybe it makes it harder for an amateur to just wing it (no pun intended) and make it looks like (s)he knows what (s)he's doing. Maybe it forces the pilot to really understand every single nuance of the plane and its operation before even being able to taxiing. Maybe it fosters speed and security in an emergency situation by having everything accessible right away, accessible through muscle memory on the part of the pilot.</p>

<p>Or maybe most cockpit designers like to make the operation of aircraft a pain in the behind for everybody else. I don't know.</p>

<p>What's the design philosophy behind the design of the cockpit controls?</p>
","<p>I would argue that the controls of an aircraft are <strong>not</strong> complicated, but rather that they are simply foreign to you.  </p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, the various controls in the aircraft do one thing:  Turn something on, or turn it off.  They are quite simple actually, but what makes it appear complicated to you is that there are so many of them.  As you learn about the airplane (especially modern ones) you will see that these individual controls are grouped together by system, in a way that actually makes pretty good sense.</p>

<hr>

<p>To put it in perspective, let's say that you had never seen a laptop computer before:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zll9U.jpg"" alt=""laptop""></p>

<p>This...  <strong>thing</strong> (remember, you've never seen one before!) has 94 buttons on the top alone!  It has all kinds of little jacks and plugs on the outside.  It has things that pop open from the side.  It's just...  <strong><em>complicated</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Then someone points out that most of the buttons on the top are buttons that you can press to make a letter show up on the screen.  This takes much of the mystery out of the complicated mess on the top, but then as you start to learn more you figure out that some of the less commonly keys are grouped together by function.  You have the arrow keys, the function keys, the key modifiers, the CD controls...  Suddenly it doesn't seem quite so complicated anymore.  </p>

<p>You complain to your friend that the monitor (hey, we've learned a fancy new word!) is a little too small, and they suggest that you hook up an external monitor.  We can do that??  Of course, that's what this port is for.  Cool, now that's one less mystery.  This goes on, and before long you can even pick up a different brand of laptop, with different buttons and pretty much figure it out on your own.  Before long...  the mystery is gone and it's just a laptop computer.</p>

<hr>

<p>And so it goes with airplanes.  Newer airplanes are being designed with fewer switches and gauges.  Take a look at the progression in the Falcon 900 series aircraft:</p>

<strong>Falcon 900EX-EASy</strong></p>

<p>Each iteration has fewer and fewer controls and instruments.  You may even say that they look less complicated.  However, I can assure you that each newer model has far more capabilities and a lot more to learn in order to understand and safely fly the airplane.  They each have the full capability of the model before it, along with additional features and more to learn.  Certain systems no longer have switches or dials and you have to look through different menus in order to access them.</p>

"What is ETOPS and how does it work?","27853","","<p>According to <a href=""http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2015-03-18-Boeing-747-8-Intercontinental-Receives-FAA-Approval-for-330-Minute-ETOPS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this press release</a> by Boeing earlier this year, the 747-8 has received its ETOPS 330 rating. This is required by all 4-engined planes made after February 2015 to fly beyond 180 minutes from an en-route alternate airport.</p>

<p>Does this apply only when one engine has already failed? I understand four-engine jets usually continue to their destination on three engines. And how does this compare to the 747-400. Can it fly ETOPS 330+ routes? I remember them doing missions that twin-engine aircraft couldn't because of their lack of ETOPS.</p>

<p><em>A follow-up question for those who are interested: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/15783/why-does-etops-not-apply-to-older-4-engine-aircraft/15838#15838"">Why does ETOPS not apply to older 4 engine aircraft?</a></em></p>
","<p>ETOPS stands for <strong>E</strong>xtended-range <strong>T</strong>win-engine <strong>O</strong>perational <strong>P</strong>erformance <strong>S</strong>tandards, a rule which permits twin engine aircrafts to fly routes which, at some point, is more than 60 minutes flying time away from the nearest airport suitable for emergency landing. ETOPS may also be interpreted as <em>Engines Turn or Passengers Swim</em>.</p>

<p>It is not a rule which applies after an engine has failed. Rather, it is a set of regulations and standards which must be met if an airliner wishes to fly its planes more than 60 minutes away from a suitable emergency airport.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Early combustion engines were noticeably unreliable. It was not uncommon for a 4-engine piston aircraft to arrive at its destination with only 3 engines running. Twin engine aircrafts, as a result, were required to fly dogleg paths to stay close enough to an adequate airport.</p>

<p>Aircrafts with more than 2 engines were not restricted by this rule. Thus, many transatlantic flights were flown with Boeing 747s and L-1011s, since airliners can fly a more direct route with these aircrafts.</p>

<p>As engineers gained more experience in jets, they slowly recognized that jet engines are much more reliable than their piston counterparts. The FAA began to approve flying twin engines 120 minutes away from a suitable airport. This made twin engine aircrafts popular, because the fuel efficiency of flying a twin is much better than flying a 4-engine 747 or A340.</p>

<h2>Certification</h2>

<p>ETOPS certification requires both the <strong>aircraft</strong> and the <strong>airline</strong> to comply with a set of standards.</p>

<p>For the aircraft, the manufacturer must demonstrate that flying with only one engine is relatively easy for the flight crew, safe for the airframe, and an extremely remote event.</p>

<p>The airline must demonstrate that its flight crew training and maintenance procedures are up to a higher standard. Pilots, engineers and staff must be specially qualified for ETOPS.</p>

<p>Recently, more operators are adopting the ETOPS approach to non-ETOPs routes. They discovered that the approach offers significant improvements in reliability, performance and dispatch rates. The cost of application is later offset by reduced maintenance costs, and costs associated with diversions, delays and turn backs.</p>

<h2>Flight Plan</h2>

<p>An ETOPS flight plan may look something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y0XkS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Let's say the aircraft's ground speed (with one engine inoperative!) is 450 knots. By drawing circles with radius 450nm around alternate airports, we can obtain areas which the flight must stay within. The flight path always stays inside one of these circles. If we are operating under ETOPS 120, we will draw the circles at 900nm.</p>

<p>Actual flight plans are slightly more complex, since winds aloft (sometimes more than 100 knots) will affect the aircraft's ground speed. Dispatchers use software to calculate a route, taking aircraft weight, fuel consumption and winds into consideration.</p>

","<p>There have only been a few aircraft built with forward-swept wings. Most notably was the X-29, which you have pictured above. Russia/USSR built one more recently in 1997, the Sukhoi Su-47. One of the biggest claims as to the superiority or an advantage of a forward-swept wing was increased maneuverability. However, in the case of the X-29, as noted in the <em>Flying Qualities Evaluation of the X-29A Research Aircraft</em>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The high pitch instability of the airframe led to wide predictions of extreme maneuverability. This perception has held up in the years following the end of flight tests. Air Force tests did not support this expectation. For the flight control system to keep the whole system stable, the ability to initiate a maneuver easily needed to be moderated. This was programmed into the flight control system to preserve the ability to stop the pitching rotation and keep the aircraft from departing out of control. As a result, the whole system as flown (with the flight control system in the loop as well) could not be characterized as having any special increased agility. It was concluded that the X-29 could have had increased agility if it had faster control surface actuators and/or larger control surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Su-47 was indeed a highly maneuverable aircraft, capable of pulling 9 Gs, however, its immediate predecessor, the Sukhoi Su-37, was capable of pulling <em>10 Gs</em>. So it's not clear whether a forward swept wing has any real positive impact on maneuverability.</p>

<p>However, stall characteristics are very different. Air tends to travel towards the rearmost end of the wing. On a standard configuration (Rear-swept wing), this of course moves from the wing root to the wingtip. On a forward-swept wing, however, this moves from the wingtip to the wing root. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MLcNp.png"" alt=""Airflow characteristics of swept wings (image courtesy of wikipedia)""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a result, the dangerous tip stall condition of a backwards-swept design becomes a safer and more controllable root stall on a forward swept design. This allows full aileron control despite loss of lift, and also means that drag-inducing leading edge slots or other devices are not required. With the air flowing inwards, wingtip vortices and the accompanying drag are reduced, instead the fuselage acts as a very large wing fence and, since wings are generally larger at the root, this improves lift allowing a smaller wing. As a result maneuverability is improved, especially at high angles of attack. At transonic speeds, shockwaves build up first at the root rather than the tip, again helping to ensure effective aileron control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the capability of the X-29 to have the tips of its wings <em>bend down</em> when at high angles of attack, the X-29 remained controllable at an angle of attack of 67 degrees. However, thanks to modern advances in thrust vectoring, the F-22 Raptor is capable of <em>sustaining</em> an angle of attack over 60 degrees.</p>

<p>With inherent instability and problems with extra stresses on the airplane for only moderate or supposed but not observed gains in instability, it is unlikely we will see combat aircraft with forward swept wings any time in the near future. Other technologies have enabled similar or enhanced performance without the need for novel concepts. </p>

"How does ILS (Instrument landing system) work?","27399","","<p>How does <strong>ILS</strong> (Instrument landing system) work?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Lxwt.jpg"" alt=""ILS""></p>

<ul>
<li>I know it provides guidance to the runway by  two signals, one modulated at 90 Hz, the other at 150 Hz, but how the airplane lock on those signals?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvfL2.jpg"" alt=""ILS""></p>

<ul>
<li>Which system in the plane is responsible for the ILS? Is the autopilot responsible for it?</li>
<li>If autopilot is used for an ILS approach, at what point does the pilot take manual control?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The ILS works using two components, a localizer and a glideslope.  The frequencies for the localizer are between 108.1-111.95 MHz and the glide slope between 329.15-335.0 MHz.  These frequencies are the carrier waves that the modulation you mention takes place upon.  A pilot is only concerned with the localizer frequency as the navigation equipment knows the paired glideslope frequency for any given localizer frequency.  </p>

<p>The equipment for transmitting the signals is pretty well described in your question.  The localizer antenna broadcasts two lobes down the length of the runway for a few miles (typically 18 nm, but some airports like LAX have a much longer serviceable distance).  The glideslope antenna sits around the 1000 ft touchdown zone markers on the runway, offset a little bit from the runway.  It broadcasts a its own two lobes centered around a 3 degree slope (this can vary by installation).  The glideslope is generally usable about 10 nm from the runway, but is generally not used that far out.  </p>

<p>The equipment in the plane responsible for using this signal comes in a few parts, an antenna, a radio and a navigation instrument.</p>

<p>The localizer signal is received the antenna used for the normal navigation signals (VOR) and there will be an additional antenna for the glideslope signal.  These signals will first go to a nav radio, which the pilot uses to select the localizer frequency (or a VOR frequency).  If a localizer frequency is selected, the radio will also listen on a specific glideslope frequency.  </p>

<p>The data from the radio is then sent to whatever instrument you are displaying the data on.  </p>

<p>The most primitive instrument is the VOR head with glideslope-type of needled navigation instrument.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tb0C3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A step up from that is an HSI, which is a bit more intuitive to fly and has better facilities for handling localizer back courses.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6g3zE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On the top end you have electronic primary flight displays that display data on a CRT or LCD screen.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eXZBL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The basis of all of these are following two needles that are shown to the pilot.  One moves side to side and tracks the localizer, and the other moves up and down and tracks the glideslope.  If both of these are centered you are in the middle of both beams and on course.  The position of the needle is determined by which lobe of the transmitter is being received stronger than the other.  When both lobes are received equally the needle will be centered. </p>

<p>To your last question, the pilot has control over the airplane for the entire approach.  The ILS does not take over the airplane.  The autopilot may be <em>slaved</em> to follow either just the localizer, or both the localizer and glideslope, or the pilot may hand fly the approach.  In both cases however, the pilot is in control, not the ILS.</p>

<p>The ILS is usable for at least 10 miles from the antennae.  At many airports you will track the localizer portion of the signal much further out than this.  You will stop using the ILS normally at 200 ft above the ground, although there are special ILS approaches with lower minimum altitudes that require special equipment and training. The majority of ILS approaches however, require the pilot to observe certain visual cues before descending below 200 ft AGL.  </p>

"What's the typical cost (and its breakdown) for a long-haul commercial flight?","27132","","<p>I realised that this question is very broad, but I intend it as an example to illustrate the actual costs incurred by a typical long-haul commercial flight.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this question, I would assume the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A380 or (modern) B747 in typical 3-class configuration</li>
<li>Full occupancy</li>
<li>12 hours flight time (or more)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the cost position I can think of right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Aircraft amortisation</li>
<li>In-flight crew salaries</li>
<li>Ground crew salaries (boarding crew, aircraft preparation and cleaning, luggage loading, etc.)</li>
<li>Catering</li>
<li>Various insurances</li>
<li>Airport fees (landing tax, etc.)</li>
<li>Overflight fees</li>
<li>Administrative cost (managing/issuing tickets, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I missing? What would be the absolute (and relative) cost budget for each of these? </p>

<p>Bonus question: in airline operations, is this cost typically handled as ""per flight hour"" (as in general aviation), ""per flight"", or in another way?</p>
","<h2>Fuel</h2>

<p>The fuel consumption of the A380 is about 11 metric tonnes per hour. With a fuel price of <a href=""http://www.iata.org/publications/economics/fuel-monitor/Pages/price-analysis.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""IATA Fuel price table"">\$1000 per metric tonne</a>, this results in \$11000 per flight hour. </p>

<h2>Amortization</h2>

<p>An A380 will cost about \$350M. The aircraft will be used for about 25 to 30 years, but let's assume the amortization period is about 20 years with a residual value of \$50M. With an interest rate of 5%, you would pay about \$24M per year. </p>

<p>That is about \$2740 per hour, or \$0.76 per second, flying or not. 
Assuming a usage of  60%, taking into account turn around times at the gate and maintenance downtime,  it boils down to \$3915 per flight hour. </p>

<h2>Crew</h2>

<p>Captain costs <a href=""http://www.askcaptainlim.com/salary-propilot-78/307-singapore-airlines-pilots-salary.html%20Singapore%20airlines%20salaries"" rel=""noreferrer"">\$160K per year, the F/O \$90000</a>. Let's assume they fly about 60 hours per month, the combined flight deck crew cost is about \$350 per flight hour for the base salary. Another \$80 needs to be added for allowances bringing the total to \$430 per flight hour. </p>

<p>Cabin crew rate would be around $40 per hour, so for 20 crew the cost will be \$800 per flight hour.  </p>

<p>Also allowances for overnight stays and hotel costs need to be taken into account</p>

<h2>Airport charges</h2>

<p>These vary extremely between airports. You can basically break the costs down into costs related to the aircraft, the passengers and various taxes by the government. </p>

<p>Aircraft cost usually are related to the Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM) of the aircraft and the noise category. A Boeing 747-400, while less heavy than an A380, will in some cases be more expensive due to the higher noise level. Many airports differentiate between peak and off-peak hour landings. </p>

<p>I can't find accurate data for the A380 but an old table that I have for the Boeing 747-400 suggest that total the cost vary between about \$6000 to \$25000. </p>

<h2>Overflight charges</h2>

<p>Fees are levied by countries whose territory is flown over, mainly to cover ATC cost. The cost is typically based on the distance flown and the MTOW. For a 747-400ER over Europe, the fee is on average <a href=""http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/publication/files/customer-guide-2014-version-8-0-with-coversheet.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">145EUR per 100km</a>. Assuming an average speed of about 900km/h, the hourly cost is about 1300EUR/h. These costs are lower over the high seas and over the US. </p>

<h2>Rough total</h2>

<p>Based on the above, the total will be between \$22,000 and \$41,000 per hour.</p>

"How much should it cost to get IFR-rated? What to look for?","27037","","<p><em>(Related to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/627/how-much-generally-speaking-does-it-cost-to-learn-how-to-fly"">this question</a>)</em></p>

<p>Many pilots have told me that an IFR rating is the most valuable thing i can do to improve my flying and margin of safety.   </p>

<p>I know there are courses as quick as, ""Get your IFR in 10 days!"", but I'm unsure if that's  quality training that will stick with me.   </p>

<p><strong>How much should it cost for a robust, worthwhile IFR program for single engine land airplanes?<br>
What would distinguish a worthy program from one that merely meets minimums?</strong></p>
","<p>The Part 141 flight school that I used to work at quoted around \$7,000 for their instrument package, which was 30 hours of dual flight, 20 hours of ground instruction, and 10 hours of PC-ATD simulator time. They were a Cessna Pilot Center using the old CPC King Schools course. It was a good course, and while numbers varied, I did have a couple of students who squeaked by right on the Part 141 course minimums. Other pilots added 5 to 10 hours more flight training into the mix.</p>

<p>In general, my gut says that it should cost an average pilot who has 100+ hours and flies semi-regularly between \$7,000 and \$9,000; probably closer to the low end than the high end, especially if the student does a bunch of self study at home on a flight simulator, possibly using VATSim as a simulated ATC.</p>

<p>As far as what to look for, I would recommend a Part 141 course just because the FAA is involved in the course standards, and instructor standardization is (supposed to be) part of the 141 criteria. It might be worth asking what their first-attempt pass rate is on checkrides, but that's not a meaningful long-term measure of the course's quality, just a short-term one.</p>

<p>You should find a course whose syllabus makes sense, includes simulator training and scenario-based flights, and make sure you work with an instructor you like. They can't be your best friend - they very well might need to give you some serious critique or cut a lesson short because things aren't going well - but you should be happy to spend a couple of hours a foot away from them in the cockpit.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/267122/"" rel=""noreferrer"">From here:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The amount of flex is really a product of the material. The wing requires a specified ultimate strength; with metal, that translates into a given amount of flex. This can be varied within limits, but it is really the material, its stiffness to yield point ratio, and its fatigue properties, that control how much flex you are going to end up with. CFRP is a very different material, and has much less stiffness for the same yield point, and has essentially no fatigue problems. This is beneficial in that it provides a smoother ride in turbulence; the wing acting essentially like a giant leaf spring. There is some lift lost due to the nature of the curvature, though. However, this is relatively small.</p>

<p>The cargo holds in typical airliners are indeed pressurized. Take a look at a cross section of an airliner (A380 here):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ytbmj.png"" alt=""A380 Fuselage Cross Section""></p>

<p>The round shape of the fuselage outline is very efficient at withstanding pressure. Because of that, everything within the fuselage shape is pressurized. This includes the cargo hold below. Only cargo holds located behind the aft pressure bulkhead would be unpressurized, and these are mainly found in smaller aircraft.</p>

<p>The floor of the passenger cabin is not designed to withstand that pressure, because the flat surface would need to be much heavier to do so. Decompression events <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title14-vol1/xml/CFR-2011-title14-vol1-sec25-365.xml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">are considered by regulations though</a>, so there are vents that allow the pressure to equalize. In older aircraft without these vents, a decompression event can cause the floor of the cabin to collapse, as in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_96"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this incident</a> (and because it wasn't addressed, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_981"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one too</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are cargo holds heated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes. This will depend on the aircraft type. <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/241772"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There</a> <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/275381/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">are</a> <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/75643/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many</a> <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/13748"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">threads</a> over on the TechOps forums about this. The temperature can be adjusted depending on the cargo load.</p>

<p>Although the air outside the plane is cold, the walls are insulated (also for fire protection), and being pressurized along with the cabin helps too. Even in unheated cargo holds, the temperature should be above freezing. For example, <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/22604/12976"">the cargo bay of a 767 stays above 7˚C but with heat stays above 18˚C</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do they have lights? (Aren't some lit for animals?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do have lights, mainly for ground crew during loading and unloading. See <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_06/textonly/s01txt.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Boeing page</a> about fire protection where it mentions that ""another safety feature on many newer airplane models prevents the cargo lights from operating in flight"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and what about Fedex-type cargo-only aircraft?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These aircraft are still based on the airliner models (and sometimes converted from airliners). Therefore, they have the same pressurization system. The cabin is still pressurized, or they would have to put in some type of bulkhead behind the cockpit.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.acp-logistics.com/boeing-b747-400f-charter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This includes</a> the cargo version of the 747 (both upper and lower areas are pressurized).</p>

"What happens when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier?","26551","","<p>What happens when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier? Why can't it break the sound barrier near the ground?</p>
","<p>The expression ""sound barrier"" was created maybe 70 years ago when approaching the speed of sound made aircraft react in unanticipated ways. Actually, there is no fixed barrier, and in reality the transition can be rather smooth, provided the aircraft and its pilot are prepared for it.</p>

<p>The speed of sound is the maximum speed with which small pressure changes will propagate through a medium, so at subsonic speed the air ahead of the aircraft can react to the approaching aircraft. Pressure and speed will change smoothly while air flows around the aircraft. As a consequence, the center of local pressure changes (its lift force) acts at around one quarter of chord, such that the aircraft is balanced when its center of gravity is at the same location.</p>

<p>At supersonic speeds, the air will be taken by surprise - at one moment all was calm and quiet, and suddenly the air molecules get kicked around by an unknown intruder. Pressure changes suddenly, through a shock, so instead of a smooth transition, at supersonic speed there are regions of similar pressure, separated by sudden drops or jumps. As a consequence, the center of pressure changes shifts backwards to 50% of chord. If the center of gravity remains at a quarter chord, the consequence is a strong pitch-down moment: The aircraft will nosedive.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, a control surface deflection, which could redistribute the lift between wing and tail surface, will not necessarily work in the same way as it would at subsonic speed: the aircraft might become uncontrollable. See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/5048/why-does-supersonic-flight-detach-airflow-from-a-wing/5055#5055"">this answer</a> for a mode detailed explanation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2dlm.jpg"" alt=""sound propagation""></p>

<p>The cone you see in the right picture is a Mach cone, which would be caused by a supersonic aircraft. The picture was shamelessly copied from <a href=""http://hronrad.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/two-wings-is-megl-che-one-1-some-notes-about-sound/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog</a>.</p>

<p>The trick is now to give the air some advance warning where it counts, even when the aircraft travels at supersonic speed. This can be achieved with wing sweep, because if the sweep angle is larger than the cone angle in which pressure changes will propagate at supersonic flight speed, the air flowing over the wing will be forewarned, thus reacting similarly to subsonic flow. To correct for the inevitable shift in the center of pressure, the tail surfaces are bigger and full-flying in supersonic aircraft, so they work in trans- and supersonic flow. Also, by pumping fuel, the center of gravity can be shifted backwards, so less trim change is needed.</p>

<p>The sound barrier can be broken at any altitude, if the aircraft has a sufficiently powerful engine and is stiff enough. Normally, to save weight, the designers set a limit for maximum dynamic pressure (= air density times air speed squared), so the structural deformation at this maximum dynamic pressure is small enough. Note that the deflection of its ailerons will deform the wing of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eurofighter</a> at maximum dynamic pressure to an extent that three quarters of aileron effectiveness is lost - the ailerons cause a twisting moment which warps the wing such that it works like the wing warping mechanism in the Wright Flyer, only in opposite direction to the aileron input.</p>

<p>Since density drops with increasing altitude, the same dynamic pressure is reached at higher speed, allowing aircraft to fly faster the higher they fly. The next limit is given by the local heat near the stagnation line. If air is decelerated, its temperature will <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_temperature"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">increase with the square of the speed difference</a>. The maximum speed of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F-22</a> was reduced from Mach 1.8 to Mach 1.6 to avoid overheating the sensitive composite wing structure.</p>

"Can a plane fly without the Vertical Stabilizer?","26379","","<p>What would happen if a plane (for the sake of the question let's say that the plane is an Airbus A380) lose its  Vertical Stabilizer?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yP7rR.png"" alt=""Vertical Stabilizer""></p>
","<p>The plane will probably crash.</p>

<p>The vertical stabilizer provides stability in yaw to conventional aircraft. Aircraft such as the B-2 manage to provide stability through computer control, and aircraft such as the Northrop flying wings are designed to fly without one. But if an aircraft designed to be stable using a vertical stabilizer loses that surface, it will be very difficult for pilots to stabilize manually with the remaining systems. While roll and differential thrust will both affect yaw, they will both be slower to react than a rudder, especially in a large aircraft like an A380. This can also damage the hydraulic systems, making it more difficult to control the remaining surfaces.</p>

<p>If experienced test pilots are at the controls (as in the B-52 incident below), or if the failure is anticipated and trained for, it's possible that the aircraft would be controllable enough to land safely. However, as the incidents below show, this kind of failure does not happen often, and can easily exceed the crew's ability to control the plane.</p>

<p>Examples where this has happened:</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123"">Japan Airlines Flight 123</a> lost most of its vertical stabilizer when the rear pressure bulkhead failed. Despite also losing hydraulic systems, the pilots managed to keep the plane in the air for a while, but ended up crashing into a mountain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_587"">American Airlines Flight 587</a> lost its vertical stabilizer when the pilot's rudder inputs over-stressed the structure. It crashed shortly after.</p>

<p>In 1964, a B-52 <a href=""http://www.talkingproud.us/Military/B52%20No%20Tail/B52NoTail.html"">lost most of its vertical stabilizer</a> due to extreme turbulence. The pilots were able to extend air brakes on the wing tips to provide some stability. The Air Force sent up a chase plane to help guide the pilots, and provided engineering guidance from the ground. The crew were able to bring the plane back for a safe landing (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJuEAQbxWRo"">see a video</a>). There were at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_structural_failures"">three other instances</a> where the vertical stabilizer failed on B-52's, all ending with the loss of the plane. This particular flight was conducted with test pilots to intentionally fly through turbulence, recording data to help understand the failures on the other aircraft. However, the flight encountered unexpectedly severe turbulence, leading to the separation of the vertical stabilizer.</p>

"What is Cost Index?","26239","","<p>I'm not sure if it's just in Boeing aircraft, but I've heard that Cost Index has something to do with flight planning but have no idea what it is.</p>

<p>What is it for and how is it calculated? (I'm happy for the simple version of the calculation if it's too hard to explain)</p>
","<p>The cost index is a number used in the Flight Management System (FMS) to optimize the aircraft's speed. It gives the ratio between the unit cost of time and the unit cost of fuel. </p>

<p>With this number, and knowledge about the aircraft's performance, it is possible to calculate the optimal speed for the aircraft, which results in the lowest total cost. </p>

<p>Speeds slower than the optimal speed will result in less fuel burn, but also in more flying time. The cost of the extra flying time outweighs the fuel savings at speeds below the optimum speed.</p>

<p>Speeds faster than the optimal speed will result in more fuel burn, but also in less flying time. The saving of less flight time do not outweigh the fuel burn at speeds above the optimum speed. </p>

<p>A low cost index means that the cost of time is low or that fuel is expensive. It will result in a low speed. High cost index means high cost of time (e.g. passengers about to miss their flight connection) or low fuel price (rare these days). </p>

<p>At the minimum cost index (0) only fuel counts. This will result in the aircraft flying at Maximum Range Cruise. At the maximum cost index only time counts. This will result in the aircraft flying at Maximum Cruise Speed (V<sub>mo</sub> / M<sub>mo</sub> with a buffer) </p>

<p>Airlines generally have a standard cost index they use for planning and adjust them on a flight by flight basis. </p>

"Does temperature affect takeoff performance?","26079","","<p>A few days ago, a Copa flight from Porto Alegre to Panama was delayed from noon until 12:30 AM. The company explained that the high temperature (about 40 degress Celsius) would require a longer runway for takeoff since the air was thinner, and that resulted in non-operational conditions for the wings and engines with the available runway length.</p>

<p>One source (in portuguese): <a href=""http://www.radioguaiba.com.br/Noticias/?Noticia=515816"">http://www.radioguaiba.com.br/Noticias/?Noticia=515816</a></p>

<p>Is this true? Can a high temperature really prevent takeoff?</p>
","<p>Yes, temperature effects airplane performance <em>both</em> the engine itself and the aerodynamics involved.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Density Altitude?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard
  temperature. As temperature and altitude increase, air density
  decreases. In a sense, it's the altitude at which the airplane ""feels""
  its flying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How Will High Density Altitude Affect Flight?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a hot and humid day, the aircraft will accelerate more slowly down
  the runway, will need to move faster to attain the same lift, and will
  climb more slowly. The less dense the air, the less lift, the more
  lackluster the climb, and the longer the distance needed for takeoff
  and landing. Fewer air molecules in a given volume of air also result
  in reduced propeller efficiency and therefore reduced net thrust. All
  of these factors can lead to an accident if the poor performance has
  not been anticipated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.aopa.org/Pilot-Resources/Safety-and-Technique/Weather/Density-Altitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tips for Flying in High Density Altitude Areas</a></p>

<p>One way of looking at it is that higher temperatures make the airplane fly the way it would at a higher altitude where the air is less dense. An airplane cannot climb to infinity, it has what is called a service ceiling [and an absolute ceiling] that the aircraft can no longer climb any higher. This also because of a decrease in air density, but for a different reason. Raising the temperature of the air also decreases this air density. You can use an <a href=""http://wahiduddin.net/calc/calc_da.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air Density Calculator</a> or a <strong>Density Altitude Chart</strong>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iPYzc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>to determine how the aircraft will fly. It is especially important at airports with short runways or high actual altitudes [Denver, Colorado for example] where the aircraft already may need to be near maximum performance. </p>

<p>If the density altitude is 4,000ft than that means that airplane will fly like it was at 4,000ft at standard atmospheric temperature. Standard atmospheric temperature [at sea level] is 15 degrees Celsius or 59 degrees Fahrenheit. An airplane departing at a sea level airport, at 100F would feel like it is already flying at over 2600ft. An airplane departing at a 5,000ft airport would feel like it is already flying at over 8700ft. If clearing the trees at the end of the runway was already a concern at this particular airport it may not happen anymore.</p>

However, <a href=""http://www.flightradar24.com/39.66,-86.27/10"">FlightRadar24</a> for the area doesn't seem to show them at all. </p>

<p>It's dim enough that I couldn't make out the markings on the choppers before I went inside, but at least one or two are local news stations, and the third is either another news station or a police chopper.

","<p>FlightRadar and similar websites use <a href=""http://www.flightradar24.com/how-it-works"" rel=""nofollow"">several sources</a> for aircraft detection, most commonly they use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast"" rel=""nofollow"">ADS-B</a>. Not all General Aviation aircraft, to which helicopters would count normally, are equipped with transponders that are capable of emitting ADS-B data, so they would not show via regular means on FlightRadar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primary technology that Flightradar24 use to receive flight information is called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B).</p>
  
  <p>ADS-B is a relatively new technology under development which means that today it's rarely used by Air Traffic Control (ATC). Our estimations show that roughly 65% of all commercial passenger aircraft (75% in Europe, 35% in the US) are equipped with an ADS-B transponder. For general aviation this number is probably below 20%. But this percentage is steadily increasing as ADS-B will become mandatory for most aircraft in most airspaces around the world, by year 2020. When mandatory, ADS-B will replace primary radar as the primary surveillance method used by ATC.</p>
  
  <p>Flightradar24 has a network of more than 4,000 ADS-B receivers around the world that receives plane and flight information from aircraft with ADS-B transponders and sends this information to our servers. Due to the high frequency used (1090 MHz) the coverage from each receiver is limited to about 250-400 km (150-250 miles) in all directions depending on location. The farther away from the receiver an aircraft is flying, the higher it must fly to be covered by the receiver. The distance limit makes it very hard to get ADS-B coverage over oceans.</p>
  
  <p>About 99% of Europe is covered with ADS-B receivers. There is also good ADS-B coverage in USA, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Brazil, Russia, Middle East, India, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. In other parts of the world the ADS-B coverage varies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other option is to receive the regular Mode-S transponder signal by a technique called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateration"" rel=""nofollow"">Multilateration (MLAT)</a>, however the FlightRadar website states that this is something that only works reliably at high altitude, at least 5 000 to 10 000 ft.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In some regions with coverage from several FR24-receivers we also calculate positions of non-ADS-B equipped aircraft with the help of Multilateration (MLAT), by using a method known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). By measuring the difference in time to receive the signal from aircraft with an older ModeS-transponder, it's possible to calculate the position of these aircraft. Four FR24-receivers or more, receiving signals from the same aircraft, are needed to make MLAT work. That means that MLAT coverage can only be achieved above about 5,000-10,000 feet as the probability that signal can be received by four or more receivers increases with increased altitude.</p>
  
  <p>Most parts of Europe are today covered with MLAT above about 5,000-10,000 feet. There is also some MLAT coverage in North America, Mexico, Australia and Brazil. More areas will get MLAT coverage during 2014 and 2015.</p>

"How does wing sweep increase aircraft stability?","25540","","<p>I was told at one point that the sweep of a wing can help with the straight line stability of the craft, in fact I think it's one of the main systems that keeps flying wings flying straight (like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit"">B-2</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_N-9M"">N9-M</a>, which comes from the 40s, way before the use of flight computers for stability...).</p>

<p>Why is that?  Are there trade offs between that stability and say, speed?  Is there a such thing as too much sweep?</p>
","<h2><em>Directional stability</em></h2>

<p>When a swept wing is flying in a sideslip, the windward side behaves like a wing with less effective sweep $\varphi_{eff}$ and the leeward side like one with more effective sweep. Wing sweep  causes a flattening of the lift curve slope for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The effective angle of attack is reduced by the cosine of the sweep angle.</li>
<li>Only the component of speed normal to the quarter-chord line of the wing is creating lift, so a swept wing creates less lift per area than a straight wing.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xdpbx.png"" alt=""SB-13 in sideslip""></p>

<p>The increased lift rolls the aircraft, but also produces increased lift-induced drag which pulls it back to straight flight. The sketch above shows this for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaflieg_Braunschweig_SB-13_Arcus"" rel=""noreferrer"">flying wing glider SB-13</a>. This effect is so strong that swept, high-wing configurations need anhedral to keep the sideslip-induced rolling moment down.</p>

<p>For completeness, also the side force $Y$ of fuselage and winglets is added and shows that the winglets help a lot to create directional stability. This is needed in case of the SB-13 because it has a nearly elliptical lift distribution. Using a triangular distribution (N9-M) or even a bell-shaped distribution (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten_brothers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Horten</a> flying wings) avoids the need for winglets, but causes higher induced drag in straight flight. Another downside is a low directional stability at high speed, because this sweep effect increases with the lift coefficient on the outer wing.</p>

<h2><em>Longitudinal stability</em></h2>

<p>Wing sweep also helps in longitudinal stability by stretching out the wing lengthwise. This is important for flying wings which lack a separate tail surface. By changing flap angles at the center or the wing tips, the lift at the most forward or most backward sections can be changed for pitch control, and more sweep increases the lever arm of these changes. Also, in swept flying wings natural static stability can be achieved without the use of reflex airfoils, but by applying washout. Again, the higher the sweep angle, the less washout is required.</p>

<h2><em>Too much sweep?</em></h2>

<p>Easily! Sweeping a wing creates lots of problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sweep reduces the lift curve slope and the maximum lift of a wing. The maximum landing attitude with a highly swept, slender wing is severely limited by wing tip clearance, so swept wings need powerful high-lift devices.</li>
<li>Sweep causes the boundary layer to be washed outboard, which will cause nasty stall behavior once a specific ratio of wing aspect ratio and sweep has been exceeded. This can be somewhat limited by wing fences, but should better be avoided altogether.</li>
<li>Sweep changes mean that bending moments will partially get converted to torsion moments, requiring a torsional stiffening of the wing.</li>
<li>For flying wings, sweep will let the aircraft center pitch up and down when the wing flexes. This creates a powerful interaction between the fast period mode (which is only moderately damped in flying wings) with the wing bending mode, resulting in flutter.</li>
</ol>

<h2><em>Why sweep a wing at all?</em></h2>

<p>Generally, an aircraft designer will allow only as much sweep as necessary. 
Wing sweep reduces drag when the aircraft flies with transonic or supersonic speed. Now the Mach effects depend only on the normal speed component, so they are proportional to the cosine of the sweep angle. For the N9-M this was not a factor, however, the B-2 benefits from it with a higher <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_divergence_Mach_number"" rel=""noreferrer"">drag divergence Mach number</a>.</p>

"Can civilians buy military aircraft?","25336","","<p>Say one wanted to buy a retired F-14, or F-5, or a BAE Hawk. Could I do it?</p>

<p>Obviously this would mean stripping out radars, weapons, rwr, and any other sensitive equipment, but after this, would it be possible?</p>

<p>Is there some kind of procedure for this?</p>

<p>EDIT: What is the typical way aircraft are released for sale? Is it common?</p>
","<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>Yes it is possible to buy old military aircraft; they are frequently listed in the pages of aircraft sales periodicals like Controller, Trade-A-Plane, Barnstormers, etc.  Popular piston engine military aircraft include the P-51 Mustang, AT-6 Harvard and T-28 Trojan.  East Bloc jets like the L-39 and MiG-15 are also big sellers, due to their affordability to acquire and maintain.  A number of historical organizations like the Commemerative Air Force operated old WWII fighters and bombers for display and exhibition.  And the unlimited category class at the Reno Air Races is dominated by rebuilt and souped-up WWII fighters like the P-51 and F8F Bearcat. </p>

<p>However it is illegal to buy MILITARIZED aircraft, that is those equipped with weapons, either internal or external, military mission systems eg fire control radars, FLIR/Designators, electronic warfare suites, advanced engines or any other type of equipment or system which have national security classifications or ITAR restrictions associated with them.  Sales of weapons systems like this requires Congressional approval, though, strangely enough, one could argue these restrictions violate the Second Amendment of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The United States has recently clamped down on the sales and imports of military surplus aircraft for this reason.  Nevertheless sales of these products are still occurring.  I recently saw ads for the sale of Panavia Tornado ADV aircraft which the UK is selling off to the highest bidders.  Most likely these birds suffer some sort of demilitarization process.  This usually entails mutilating the airframe to cutout wing hardpoints, removal of the radar and cannon and replacement of these items with counterweights - possibly even restrictions on the engines, stripping out datalink busses and classified avionics LRUs, etc.</p>

<p>UPDATE - One notable case of a civilian trying to acquire a military aircraft that gained national attention involved the Pepsi Bottling Company.  It centered on the following television advertisement for their Pepsi Points promotional campaign.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

            </div></div></p>

<p>As it turned out these 'Pepsi Points' could be traded on the open market at the time (as opposed to needing the additional trouble of buying Pepsi products for them) for $0.10/point.  An investor named John Leonard spent 700,000 USD to acquire the required 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, then sent them into PepsiCo and demanded a Harrier in return, claiming that PepsiCo had made an offer in the ad.  PepsiCo refused and Leonard sued.  The judge in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_v._Pepsico,_Inc."" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leonard v. PepsiCo</a> ruled that this did not constitute a legitimate offer as required by contract law and that the ad suggested the Harrier simply to be farcical.  Later versions of the ad featured the price of the jet changed to 700,000,000 Pepsi points for added deterrence.</p>

<p>Some airframes were destroyed or donated to museums to prevent spare parts from being exported to unfriendly nations; this was the fate of the poor F-14.  All Tomcats which could not be donated as artifacts or for gate guard/pole duty were chopped up and sold for scrap.  The fact that Iran still operates some 70 or so F-14s and concerns about spare parts for the AWG-9 radar sets and AIM-54 missiles ending up there was the primary motivator for this.  Hollywood producer Donald Bellesario attempted to acquire a flyable F-14; the sale was denied.</p>

<p>Still some aircraft make their way through the bureaucratic paperwork and end up in civilian hands.  There is at least one F-16A and one F-18A which are in the hands of private owners and the Tornados discussed above will join those ranks shortly.</p>

<p>In order to choose a motor  you need to determine how much weight you are planning to take, and then work out the thrust required to lift the quadcopter .Also , when purchasing motors  you need to consider Watt’s and Efficiency as well apart from Motor KV and Thrust.The higher the Efficiency, the better it is.The manufacturer/seller of Motors will provide the specifications about the Motor. This will help you to find out the thrust,power, rpm etc of the motor.</p>

<p>Quadcopters have 2 clockwise(CW) and 2 counter-clockwise(CCW) propellers and it has two flight configurations. X config and + config. In X config two arms will face front side while in + config only one arm will face front side. If you are making Quadcopter with plus config you can tune your quadcopter easily by  single axis tuning method .</p>

<p>Increased propeller pitch and length generally  draws  more current. Also the pitch can be defined as the travel distance of one single prop rotation. In other words, higher pitch means slower rotation, but will increase your vehicle speed which in turn will use more power.If your intention is to do acrobatics, you will need torque propellers which provide more acceleration and it puts less pressure on the power system. Lower pitch propellers will also improve stability.A higher pitch propeller moves greater amount of air, which could create turbulence and cause the aircraft to wobble during hovering. If you notice this with your quadcopter, try to choosing a lower pitched propeller.</p>

"What is the difference between Hobbs Time and Tach Time?","25127","","<p>Over in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/5022"">this answer</a> there's a description of Hobbs Time versus Tach Time, and how the Hobbs counts hours while the tach time is equivalent to ""hours at cruise RPM"".</p>

<p>How do these two ""clocks"" work, and what do these numbers mean in practical terms for flying and maintaining an aircraft?</p>
","<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbs_meter"">Hobbs Time</a></strong></p>

<p>In most planes, the Hobbs clock is started and stopped based on an oil pressure switch, so it starts when the engine starts, and stops when the engine is shut-down. While it's running, it just ticks off a tenth of an hour every 6 minutes, based on ""regular wall clock time"". So a tenth of idling on the ramp is the same as a tenth at cruise.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tach_Timer"">Tach Time</a></strong></p>

<p>The tach clock isn't really a clock at all, it doesn't actually measure time, it really measures engine revolutions. But it's calibrated such that a tenth of an hour of tach time is clicked off when the engine is at cruise RPM for 6 minutes. In other words, if the plane is at cruise RPM, the tach clock will be clicking off tenths of an hour at the same rate as the Hobbs clock, and the same as the watch on your wrist. But if the engine is idling at an RPM speed that's half of what cruise RPM is, then the tach clock will be running at half the speed of the Hobbs clock.</p>

<p><strong>Relation</strong></p>

<p>So, for the tach clock, less ""time"" is clocked when the plane is idling on the ramp, or flying at low RPM. For short flights (where ramp idling time is a significant percentage of total time), and flights where you're doing a lot of pattern work (and thus operating at low RPM), tach time will be significantly less than Hobbs time.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>When an engine is replaced or overhauled, that engine is considered to be ""zero time"". Whether they actually reset the tach gauge to 0 when the engine is overhauled, or if there's a way to put a time on a brand new tach or Hobbs meter when the old one dies and is replaced, I dunno, but in general, I'd assume that the aircraft's engine and airframe log books are really the official recording of the progression of airframe/engine times, so I don't know that it's particularly important whether the tach is set to the engine's time, or if it's really just used as an incremental meter.</p>

<p>It seems to be coming from the AC vents of aircraft. I think its a quite common phenomenon as the cabin crew didn't even paid any attention to this. 
But I saw it for the first time. What is this?</p>

<p>Aircraft Details : <a href=""https://planefinder.net/data/aircraft/VT-IDE"" rel=""noreferrer"">VT-IDE</a> (A 3.5 year old A320)</p>

<p>The departure location was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Patnaik_International_Airport"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bhubaneshwar</a> and the approximate weather was: 
Temperature : 28 °C
Humidity ~ 85%
Clear Sky, good visibility</p>
","<h3>Short answer</h3>

<p>The cabin was filled with unconditioned air from the outside, warm and nearly saturated in water vapor, and the dew point (see below) close to the ambient temperature. The conditioning system while injected cold air in the cabin decreased the temperature below the dew point. Invisible water vapor (gas) was converted into visible water droplets (liquid).</p>

<p>The water droplets are nearly immediately re-evaporated in warmer air remote from the AC outlets. Eventually all cabin air with its high level of water vapor will be circulated into the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/24809/why-is-air-mixed-with-bypass-air-on-the-a-c-of-an-aircraft?lq=1"">water separators</a> of the packs, and as pointed out by @JanHudec the humidity level will be kept low during the rest of the flight, removing the possibility of condensation.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Why does water vapor condense?</strong></p>

<p>The quantity of water vapor in air is named water saturation ratio (or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity"" rel=""noreferrer"">relative humidity</a>) and is expressed as a percentage. 0% means air is dry, 100% means air is fully saturated and cannot contain more water vapor. If vapor is added then it immediately condenses into water droplets. Contrary to water vapor, water droplets are visible.</p>

<p>Saturation occurs at certain combinations of temperature and pressure. For a given pressure, the higher the temperature, the larger the quantity of vapor than can be present without condensation. So condensation can occur when the temperature decreases.</p>

<p><strong>Dew point</strong></p>

<p>The temperature at which it occurs is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point"" rel=""noreferrer"">dew point</a>. When air temperature has not yet reached the dew point, but is close, and the temperature is for some reason decreased below the dew point, then water vapor condensation occurs. The quantity of water vapor at the dew point is called water vapor capacity of air, it increases exponentially with air temperature:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gKaRK.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gKaRK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>(<a href=""https://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/lemke/geog101/text_notes/07a_saturation_curve.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</sup></p>

<p>For sake of accuracy: When water vapor is present in air, it is continuously condensed and evaporated. The dew point is the point where condensation occurs at a greater rate than evaporation and water droplets start accumulating.</p>

<p>The dew point may be measured with a wet thermometer:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6ntd.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6ntd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>(<a href=""https://www.starpath.com/catalog/accessories/1328PJ.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</sup></p>

<p><strong>Dew point and fog/mist</strong></p>

<p>The dew point is important in aviation because if the temperature is close to the dew point over the ground, then you may find fog at this location. When the dew point is very lesser than the ambient temperature, then fog is unlikely to happen. See <a href=""http://w1.weather.gov/obhistory/KLAX.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">KLAX ASOS reports</a>, and compare relative humidity, visibility and temperatures:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVEGQ.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVEGQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>  </p>

<p>As indicated when the dew point is close to the temperature, the humidity percentage is high, and the visibility low, with fog occurring.</p>

<p><strong>Air conditioning on commercial aircraft</strong></p>

<p>AC is provided by a system that usually takes high pressure air from the engines, mixes it with air taken from the cabin, and control the temperature and moisture (and pressure as part of the pressurization function) before injecting it in the cabin. Moisture is controlled by condensing water vapor and removing it by centrifugal force. For a full description see <a href=""http://www.smartcockpit.com/download.php?path=docs/&amp;file=B737-Air_Conditioning_Systems_Summary.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">ECS</a> for Boeing and <a href=""https://fr.scribd.com/doc/270658665/A320-21-Air-Conditioning-System"" rel=""noreferrer"">ACS</a> for Airbus. Relative humidity value in cabin is kept about 20%.</p>

<p><strong>You case at Bhubaneshwar</strong></p>

<p>The airport weather is 28°C and 85% humidity. Cabin air is assumed to be in these conditions before the AC is switched on and starts conditioning air at 20°C and 20% humidity.</p>

<p>This warm air is clearly in excess of water:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relative humidity value must be decreased from 85% to 20%.</li>
<li>Air must be cooled from 28°C to 20°C, cooling decreases the water vapor capacity. From the curve above, saturated air contains 27g of water vapor per kg of air at 28°C, and 17g at 20°C.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other humidity values:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b93aw.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b93aw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>  </p>

<p>When air is cooled at 20°C, 6g/kg are condensed into water droplets. When the relative humidity is lowered to 20%, the water vapor capacity is decreased to 3.4 g/kg and 13.6 additional grams are condensed.</p>

<p>Each kg of conditioned air creates 19.6 g of water droplets. A typical cabin of 150m<sup>3</sup> containing about 175 kg of air, delivers 3.5 kg of condensed water (that's only for a cabin without passengers, as perspiration and breathing will add more water, continuously):</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the condensation happens in the AC system and the water is collected by the water separator.</li>
<li>Before the cabin is initially cooled, air from the AC system meets the warm and nearly saturated air of the cabin. This triggers condensation in the cabin around the AC outlets. But most of the water evaporates again at some distance and vapor will eventually be collected by the water separators.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common examples of condensation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Frost around the freezer pipes: Air with water vapor enter the fridge when the door is open. When air starts to be cooled below the dew point by the pipes, condensation occurs and ice forms around them.</p></li>
<li><p>Air exhaled when the weather is cold. Air in our lungs is not saturated due to the high body temperature, but becomes saturated when it starts cooling.</p></li>
<li><p>Air saturated by water vapor coming from a pressure cooker.</p></li>
<li><p>As pointed out by @RyanMortensen, saturated air on car windows (when the temperature decreases during the night, or when air is saturated without temperature change, because there is more water/rain in the air that can be evaporated naturally -- Increasing car temperature above the dew point is the solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Fog and clouds formation: Fog because the ground is colder than the surrounding atmosphere (early in the morning), cloud because air is cooled below the dew point while it climbs (pressure and suddenness play also a role).</p></li>
<li><p>Dew :-)</p></li>

"Why does an aircraft as big as the Airbus A400M use turboprops?","24891","","<p>Why is it that a plane as big as the C-17 (the A400M is slightly smaller though) use turboprops instead of turbofans? Both aircraft seem to have the same purpose and are both capable of landing at short runways. So why does the A400M have turboprops?</p>

<p>I want to know why two very large planes have different propulsion systems.</p>
","<p>This answer needs some background information.</p>

<p>What became the A400M started as the Future Large Aircraft or FLA in 1983. Airbus was worried what to do with their engineers after work on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family"">A320</a> was completed, and the next projects, soon to be called TA9 and TA11 (TA for Twin Aisle; they would eventually mature into the A330 and A340), were still far, far away. So the idea of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transall"">Transall</a> follow-up was dreamed up to keep Airbus busy, and the engines for this plane would help <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snecma"">Snecma</a> to fund the development of their next engine after the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFM_International_CFM56"">CFM56</a>. Yes, the FLA started life with four turbofans!</p>

<p>However, the European military did not like to have turbofans on something that should have the shortest <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_field_takeoff"">field length</a> requirements possible, and especially their desire for the new transport aircraft to backup under its own power made them to demand turboprops. So in the late Eighties the FLA was converted to turboprops. These were to use the core of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snecma_M88"">M88 engine</a>, so Snecma would be happy with the new configuration.</p>

<p>This project went through many ups and downs in the quarter of a century between its start and the first flight of the A400M, and many of the sometimes ugly details should better never be mentioned …</p>

"What are the basics of flying non-revenue?","24717","","<p>I've never worked for an airline, but I know that one of the benefits of working in the industry is that you can fly for free or almost free on a space-available basis.  I realize that every airline is slightly different, but what's the general procedure for this?  To provide a concrete example, let's say I live in New York and want to non-rev to Miami tomorrow.</p>

<p>How would I know if a space is available?  How far ahead will I know that I have a seat?  Can more senior employees beat me out or is it first come, first served?  Do I need a boarding pass?  If not, how do I get past the TSA checkpoint?</p>

<p><strong>In general, how does flying non-rev work?</strong></p>
","<p>There are a few classes of Non-rev travel.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jumpseating</li>
<li>Online pass travel</li>
<li>Interline pass travel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jumpseating</h3>

<p>This is open to pilots and flight attendants, air-traffic controllers (not sure if this is currently true, but it used to be), certain company and government officials (e.g. the FAA and others). </p>

<p>In general pilots can only occupy pilot jumpseats and flight attendants can only occupy flight attendant jumpseats.  I know of cases where pilots can sit in the FA jumpseats but this is largely a topic of the Pilots and FA Union contracts.  In general pilots can jumpseat on any other 121 carrier and some 135 carriers.  Note that jumpseating does not necessarily mean you'll be in the cockpit, as current regulations stipulate you should not sit in the cockpit unless there are not seats in the cabin available.  </p>

<p>If you list for a jumpseat you will generally be the lowest priority for a cabin seat, boarding after all other non-rev travelers and then in a specified priority order jumpseaters will fill up the cabin and then the cockpit jumpseats until space is exhausted.</p>

<p>Jumpseating is the most versatile of the options, but the most limited in who can use it.  It is good to keep in mind your jumpseat agreements probably allow jumpseating on cargo 121 carriers in addition to passenger 121 carriers, so keep Fedex, UPS, Atlas, etc in mind when travelling.  Your spouse/kids won't be able to join you though.  </p>

<h3>Online Pass Travel</h3>

<p>The specifics of this travel depends on your airline, but I will speak in general terms.  Pass travel is usually available to the employee, the employeers domestic partner or spouse, the employees minor children and the employees parents.  There is usually also a program for a limited number of passes for friends (buddy passes).  </p>

<p>Pass travel is usually limited to your airline those you have a business relationship with.  For example a regional carrier can usually pass travel on the legacy carrier they contract with.  A legacy carrier can usually pass travel on its regional contracts.  If a regional contracts with multiple legacies, you sometimes only pass travel on the legacy system of the legacy you perform flights for.  It can be complicated.</p>

<p>There is always a defined priority for pass travel.  In general employees ride before spouses/parents/children who ride before buddy passes (except when travelling together, you may all share the priority of the highest priority pass on the itinerary).  When multiple companies are involved, the priority levels may reflect a higher priority for the company operating the flight employees than the legacy/regional contract carriers.  </p>

<p>Again, this will vary greatly from company to company and you will learn the specific rules that apply to you when you are hired somewhere.</p>

<h3>Interline travel</h3>

<p>These passes are known as ID75, ID90, etc where the number is the percent discount from a <em>full fare</em> ticket.  You can generally buy passes for yourself, your spouse/domestic partner and your children.  No buddy passes.</p>

<p>To get an ID90, you visit your travel office and request an interline ticket for a specific city pair.  For example you can buy an ID90 for Rome - NYC.  You get an old school paper ticket for that route and no specific airline.  When you want to use the ID90, you present it to the ticketing agents for the airline you want to ride that flies the route you want to fly.  They will in turn issue you a non-revue standby boarding pass.  These are generally lower priority than online pass travel when it comes time to board.  These tickets are fully refundable, so they are often purchased as backups to get home when travelling in case you cannot get back with online passes.</p>

<h3>How it all works</h3>

<p>If you are the employee, you have a company ID and use this to get through security.  If you are the spouse/partner/child/buddy, then you will print out a standby boarding pass and use that to get through security.  You can check bags, which will get tagged standby and <em>should</em> board if you do.  It can be good to remind the gate you have bags checked when you get a seat.</p>

<p>If you are flying on your own carrier or under your legacy brand, you generally have computer access to the passenger boarding totals.  These can often be hard numbers of people booked, checked in and standbys listed.  You can use this to gauge the likelihood of getting on a plane.  If you are travelling offline then a carrier might have a phone number available but they may only tell you ""it looks good!"" or ""it looks bad"" and will not divulge numbers.</p>

<p>Once you are at the gate, you play the waiting game.  You will have a boarding priority which may look something like this for a legacy carrier flight:</p>

<ol>
<li>Legacy pilots</li>
<li>Legacy flight attendants</li>
<li>Legacy retired pilots/FA</li>
<li>The legacies regional contract pilots / FA</li>
<li>Legacy spouse/parents/domestic partner/kids</li>
<li>The regional contract spouse/parents/domestic partner/kids</li>
<li>Codeshare pass agreements</li>
<li>Buddy passes</li>
<li>Interline passes</li>
<li>Cabin jumpseats</li>
<li>Cockpit jumpseats</li>
</ol>

<p>This will assuredly vary based on who you work for and who they contract with, and is just to illustrate the complexity of the priority structure.  Within each category listed above there is an internal priority that for many is based on date of hire, others based on time of listing.  Again, this varies.</p>

<p>After all the confirmed revenue passengers board, the gate will board the revenue standby passengers, and once they are on and the number of empty seats is known (misconnects, people not in the boarding area 15 minutes prior to departure, etc), they will board according to the non-rev priority.  When the cabin is completely full, no more non-revs may board except for the jumpseaters, who may then fill the available jumpseats.</p>

<h3>Putting it together</h3>

<p>If you wanted to non-rev from NYC to Miami tomorrow and your company flies that route, then you just wake up in the morning, list yourself, take a look at the boarding totals and head to the airport.  If you don't even want to do that and you are a pilot, you just go down to the airport, find a gate with a plane headed to Miami and list for the jumpseat on that plane.  If the many rules of priority work out, you get on and you go to Miami. </p>

<h3>Some considerations</h3>

<p>Pass travel often has a dress code.  Don't show up in a tshirt and shorts unless you know you are allowed, you can be denied boarding.  Make sure all of your pass riders are behaving themselves.  This is especially important to impress on anyone you give a buddy pass, as when they screw up as a pass rider, <em>you</em> can have your pass travel suspended as punishment. </p>

"Why not mount airliner jet engines above the wings?","24533","","<p>It seems that most airliners put the engines below the wings, i.e. the Boeing 7*7 series and the Airbus A3** series. This requires long (heavy) landing gear, and the engines are close to the ground which may cause damage to the engines (ingest debris) or the ground.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F6xmR.jpg"" alt=""FOD""></p>

<p><strong>Why not mount the engines <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-72"" rel=""noreferrer"">above the wings</a></strong>? In addition to the shorter (lighter, stronger) landing gear, the plane would be easier to service and embark / disembark. <strong>What are the major disadvantages to having the engines above the wings for civilian airliners?</strong></p>

<p>The question <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1397/how-does-the-mounting-location-of-a-jet-engine-affect-aircraft-performance""><em>""How does the mounting location of a jet engine affect aircraft performance?""</em></a> addresses the performance issues affecting engine placement but answers do not cover over-wing placement extensively and focus only on performance and not other operational issues or design advantages.</p>
","<p><em>Maintenance</em></p>

<p>Having the engines below the wing makes them fairly easy to access, even if some kind of lift is needed. Putting them above the wing would make them much harder to get to. Dropped a tool? Better start on that wing repair too. This includes both general access to the engine and the procedures for removing and installing the engine.</p>

<p><em>Structure</em></p>

<p>An engine below the wing is fairly stable, since it is hanging from above. It naturally wants to keep hanging downwards. Mounting the engine above the wing would be less stable. It naturally wants to tip over.</p>

<p><em>Noise</em></p>

<p>If an engine is under the wing, it helps to block some of the noise from at least the mid cabin. An engine above the wing would expose much more of the cabin to noise. It could reduce the ground noise while in flight, though.</p>

<p><em>Aerodynamics</em></p>

<p>The top of the wing is the most sensitive part aerodynamically. This is why items like fuel tank access panels are placed on the bottom. Having an engine and pylon on top would affect the flow over the top of the wing.</p>

<p><em>Safety</em></p>

<p>Engines falling off the wings tends to be a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_1862"">bad</a> <a href=""http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20110518-1"">thing</a>. But if they were above the wing, they would tend to fall down onto the wing, which would still not be good. It would be harder to have then break away in a crash. Also, in the event of an uncontained failure, the wing would not provide any protection to the fuselage.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course there are benefits, such as the reduced noise, less ground clearance required, no interference between the jet blast and the flaps, and less chance of FOD being ingested. As new engines get larger fan diameters, the constraints become more difficult. Some concepts of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-48"">blended wing body</a> design put the engines on top of the body. But for the current design of aircraft, the benefits of having the engines below the wing are greater than those of the alternatives.</p>

"How do pilots see at night if airplanes don't have front lights?","24491","","<p>How can pilots identify threats ahead of them if they don't have front lights like cars?</p>
","<p>Short answer: they do have front lights!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zr9aC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Longer answer: There's lots of stuff for a ground vehicle (such as a car) to hit, because there's lots of stuff close to the ground.  There's not much in the air for an aircraft to hit, besides other aircraft.  Lights on an aircraft in flight are to help the airplane <em>be seen</em>, not to help the airplane see.</p>

<p>On landing, forward-pointed lights are nice to have, but since runways are illuminated, it's possible to land safely without them.  Airliners in particular will probably never be landing on a darkened runway and need to worry about hitting invisible terrain or obstacles ahead, because they're always either above the obstacles or they're on a known safe descent path.</p>

","<p>Small planes tend to have keys, but not all.  The bigger the plane the less likely a key is needed and once you get into jets, I can't think of any that need keys for engine starts.  The starting and securing of engines with no keys comes down to switches and knobs.  </p>

<p>Likewise with exterior doors, on smaller planes including private end executive jets, you can find keyed exterior doors and luggage compartments.  With transport jets at airlines you won't find keys. To secure those doors the jet bridge is pulled away from the airplane so there is no physical access to the boarding door. </p>

"How do you calculate minimum runway lengths for Part 135 operations using the 60% rule?","23813","","<p>FAR 135.385 requires that at your destination airport your flight planning shows that you could make a full-stop landing ""within 60 percent of the effective length"" of the runway when flying transport-category turbine-powered aircraft.</p>

<p>For piston-powered aircraft FAR 135.377 has a similar 70% rule.</p>

<p>How do you calculate minimum runway lengths under these rules?<br>
Can you use 80% of the runway? What if the runway is wet? </p>
","<h1>Required runway length for landing</h1>

<p>The minimum runway length required for landing under Part 135 operations is, believe it or not, the same as Part 91: You need to be able to land and stop within the available runway length specified in the AFM.   This is what you use when you are getting ready to land.</p>

<p>That being said, since you reference the ""60%/80% rules"", there is a more stringent requirement that is required as part of your <em>preflight planning</em> and specified in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f6264ba184562097b414fe34a507ebbe&amp;node=14:3.0.1.1.11.9.3.14&amp;rgn=div8"" rel=""nofollow"">14 CFR 135.385</a></p>

<h1>60% Rule for Large Turbine Transport Category Airplanes</h1>

<p>This rule is specified in 14 CFR 135.385(b), and says (in part):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>no person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane unless its weight on arrival ... would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to follow the regulation by the letter, you need to take 60% of the runway length and compare it to your actual landing distance.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We want to land on a 6,000 ft. runway, so our max allowable landing distance is 3,600 ft.:</p>

<p>$$6,000ft\times60\%=3,600ft$$</p>

<h2>Determining minimum runway length</h2>

<p>Sometimes pilots prefer to ask the question in a different way, and ask ""what is the minimum runway distance needed for the current conditions"" instead of ""what can my maximum landing distance be.  To calculate this, we simply re-arrange our formula above like this:</p>

<p>$$Minimum~Runway=\frac{Actual~Landing~Distance}{60\%}$$</p>

<p>If our actual landing distance is 3,000 ft. then we would need a minimum field length of 5,000 ft.:</p>

<p>$$\frac{3,000ft}{60\%}=5,000ft$$</p>

<h1>80% Rule</h1>

<p>The 80% rule specified in 14 CFR 135.385(f) works exactly the same way, but can only be used by an ""An eligible on-demand operator"" if approved in accordance with their Operations Specifications (A057 and C049) and the procedures listed in their Flight Operations Manual.</p>

<p>You would then replace the 60% with 80% in the above calculations.</p>

<h1>Wet Runways</h1>

<p>14 CFR 135.385(d) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less than that required by paragraph (b) of this section) has been approved for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane Flight Manual, no person may take off a turbojet airplane when the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that the runways at the destination airport may be wet or slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway length required under paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, you use the information from your AFM for wet runway landing distance, or if it isn't provided (since it isn't required), you do the same calculation that you did before but include an additional 15%.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p>Taking the example from the 60% rule and assuming that it is wet, we have a max landing distance of 3,130 ft.:</p>

<p>$$\frac{6,000ft\times60\%}{115\%}=3,130ft$$</p>

<h2>Minimum Runway Length When Wet</h2>

<p>The minimum runway distance with a 3,000 ft. actual landing distance would be 5,750 ft.:</p>

<p>$$\frac{3,000 ft\times115\%}{60\%}=5,750ft$$</p>

"Why do I get that funny stomach drop feeling right after takeoff?","23640","","<p>Right after take off 1-2 minutes into flight I get this stomach drop ""roller coaster"" feeling for split second.  It freaks people out thinking they are about to crash!  Why is that??</p>
","<p>It happens when the airplane levels off after takeoff, usually either at the first assigned altitude or at a safe altitude where it will be accelerated in order to retract the flaps.   The feeling is a result of negative vertical acceleration.  It can also happen at other times during the flight, such as during turbulence or when starting a descent.</p>

<p>Basically you and the airplane are both in a steady climb and when the aircraft levels off you continue to move up faster so it (via the seatbelt) keeps you at its same level and decelerates your own personal vertical climb.</p>

<p>It is just like the feeling you get in a roller coaster.</p>

<p>My wife calls it a wee-hill!  :-)</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another more familiar example happens anytime that you are traveling in a car:</p>

<p>If you are in a car moving at a constant speed (let's say 55 MPH) you are moving at the same speed along with it.  </p>

<p>When the brakes of the car are engaged, they slow the car down but your inertia tends to keep you moving in the direction that the car was going.  This will be more noticeable as the brakes are applied harder and harder because the deceleration of the car is more extreme.  </p>

<p>You will notice this as pressure against the seat belt as the car holds you in place.  You are still moving forward, but you are getting slower (decelerating).  In an airplane the exact same thing is happening only it is in a vertical direction instead of a horizontal direction like in the car.</p>

<p>What you are feeling is your stomach floating up a little inside your body, because while the seat belt is holding you down, it doesn't hold your stomach in place!</p>

"What does feathering mean and how does it work technically?","23611","","<p>Before I ask ""What does Feathering mean when it comes to Jet/Propeller Engines"" I have to say what I think I know:</p>

<p>Feathering jet/prop engines mean achieving a sufficient turbine rotation speed at which, the general functionalities such as VFG drives (elec), pumps, etc. could start operation. </p>

<p>I would very much appreciate an explanation with any anomalies.</p>
","<p>Feathering is not engine starting, and also is not used in turbine (excluding turboprop) aircraft. In a piston or turbo prop aircraft, in the event of an engine failure, to decrease drag so you can either glide farther or have better performance on the remaining engine(s), you can set the prop pitch lever so instead of facing at a right angle to drive air backwards and produce thrust, the propeller will instead turn edge-first into the airstream, reducing drag. Not all propeller airplanes have this capability, but it's an added safety feature.</p>

<p>In motorgliders (both light sport aircraft and primary) without retracting blades, the feathering position turns the prop so that the edge faces into the airstream and also locks the propeller so it no longer turns.</p>

"Can you fly a light GA airplane into a major hub? What operational considerations are there if you do?","23509","","<p>I did my training around the Seattle area, and was told that landing at SeaTac Airport (the region's major International/Commercial airport), while not strictly forbidden, was definitely frowned upon because it can slow down and interfere with the big planes on schedules. To discourage GA aircraft from using the big airport, they have a variety of landing fees, ramp fees, and prior-approval requirements.</p>

<p>But later, I moved near MCI, and was told that landing at the big airport was no big deal.  That they're actually happy to have little planes there.</p>

<p>If you fly small GA planes, do you land at the major airports in your area?</p>

<p><strong>What advanced preparations can you make to minimize your impact on the ""big boys"", and remain a good airspace citizen?</strong></p>
","<p>Can you?  Absolutely, and air traffic control will treat you (almost) like any other airplane.  You are supposedly handled on a first-come-first-serve basis (reality is slightly different with different aircraft speeds, etc.).  Do the airlines like it if you slow them down?  No, but it's part of the system and the way that it works.</p>

<p>Very often, there are multiple runways at bigger airports, and sometimes there are even shorter runways that are dedicated for airplanes that don't need to land on the same one as the ""big boys"".  Even if not, they will work you in.</p>

<p>Now, that being said, <em>very often</em> there is a better option.  As you said, there are usually high fees at the big airports, so landing at a smaller satellite airport can often save you money <strong>and</strong> save you time because you won't have to taxi as far or sit and wait in line to get out.  An extra 15 minutes by car can be better than an extra 30 minutes while taxiing. </p>

<p>As far as being prepared, it isn't really much different than smaller airports <em>other</em> than the fact that ATC is <em>much</em> busier.  They don't have the time/tolerance to keep repeating instructions to you, and expect you to be ""on your game"".  When they rattle off taxi instructions like ""Cessna N1234, taxi to the ramp via Alpha, Tango, Echo, and Xray. Hold short of runway 23."" they expect a quick readback and for you to follow instructions exactly because they need to move on to the next guy.  </p>

<p>It will also help everyone out if you don't fly your final approach the way that most people are taught for an entire 10 mile final:  very close to your actual landing speed.  In fact, you are usually landing on a runway that is 4X+ the distance that you need and you can slow down fairly quickly (especially compared to a jet), so if you can fly an extra 20 (or 80) knots as long as possible, it will be greatly appreciated and keep traffic moving.  Make sure that you leave yourself enough time to slow down at the end and above all else, <strong><em>be safe</em></strong>.</p>

"What exactly is an FBO and what services are provided?","23473","","<p>To most non-U.S. pilots who have little or no experience flying in the U.S., the concept of a FBO is not very well understood.</p>

<p>What exactly is a FBO and what are the services that it can provide? I've heard that they can refuel your plane, move it to a hangar, clean it, provide preflight planning facilities, etc.</p>

<p>Is there a charge for these services (I guess so) and if so, what can be expected? I've also seen many airports with multiple FBOs. How does that work?</p>

<p>All I know is that FBO stands for ""Fixed Base Operator"".</p>

<p>This may seem like a very stupid question but in Europe there's no such thing. If you need fuel you either taxi to the pump and fill up or call up the fuel provider (if you're lucky because they usually only serve private jets).</p>
","<p>A Fixed Base Operator (FBO) is an entity - usually a commercial company - which provides ""aviation services"" at an airport. One of the main services they provide is fueling, either full service or a self service pump.  They don't all provide both 100LL and JetA, but most do.  </p>

<p>Larger ones provide other services, such as catering, lavatory service, pre-flight briefing computers and wifi access, ground power units, and tie down or hangar space for parking.

"In what cases does it make sense to buy a plane before you begin pilot training?","23354","","<p>I'm halfway through a 10-year plan to pay for pilot training and buy my own plane (or a share of one).  When I was introduced to flying by a friend, he said if he had the chance to do it over again, he would have saved up and bought a plane before he started instruction.</p>

<p>The benefits he mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn in the plane you'll be flying.</li>
<li>Avoid ""throwing away"" rent money.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I've seen in most cases, though, is that most people get their license before getting a plane.  </p>

<p>Thus my question: when does it make sense to buy a plane before training for your PPL?</p>
","<p>I will mention some considerations that were not mentioned above. First of all, it does make sense to buy a plane for training, and it can save you a lot of money on rent but you need to be aware of what you are doing. The positive side is that airplanes do not depreciate as fast as most assets of their kind (it is not unheard of being able to sell an airplane for practically the same amount as you bought it several years ago). However, consider that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Usually an airplane you want to train in (something sturdy and easy to control, like a C-150) is not an airplane you would like to fly most of the time (traveling in a 150 is not a lot of fun, now a twin Comanche is a different story...).</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance costs for a student pilot (even with various restrictions) can nearly negate the advantage of not having to rent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, if you would like to buy an airplane to <em>mostly</em> train (and have some fun occasionally) and then sell and buy a 'travel' (or aerobatic) airplane, it can save you money. It is better to get your private first, however, so you can concentrate on initial training (which is a handful) without worrying about the 'pleasures' of plane ownership.</p>

"Is passenger weight distribution important on a commercial flight?","23271","","<p>This is something I've wondered about for a long time.  On really large airplanes, like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-400"">747-400</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380"">A380</a> for example, I would assume that the weight of the passengers on board is a significant to the flight characteristics of the plane. And it seems like it would be pretty easy to put all the passengers in an odd place (like all at the front or back) and as a result significantly change the flight characteristics of an aircraft.</p>

<p>So, assuming I'm right (tell me if I'm not), how do commercial aircraft counter this problem? Do they do their best to distribute passengers throughout the craft with seat assignments? Or do they have ballast they can move around (like fuel ballast)?  Or is the weight shift not significant enough to warrant anything along these lines?</p>
","<p>On the EMB-145 the passenger cabin was split into 5 zones and we were given passenger totals in each zone from the flight attendant prior to leaving the gate.  If balance is off (this happened quite rarely for us) you would tell the flight attendant ""I need 2 passengers from zone 5 moved to zone 1"" or ""I need a passenger from zone 3 moved to zone 2"" or some other similar instruction.  The flight attendant would solicit volunteers and if no one did, they would instruct someone to move.  The move was only for takeoff and once airborne they could go back to their normal seat.</p>

<p>After moving passengers we would re-calculate the weight and balance to verify we were in the envelope and set takeoff trim.</p>

<p>Similar methods are used in larger airplanes with the cabin split into zones.</p>

<p>The only time we would use ballast is when we had a full cabin and not enough bags in the cargo (not common).  In those cases we would ask ops for ballast and they would put something in the cargo.  They would try to make it useful if an outstation needed something else they would just load 50 lb bags of sand.</p>

"What is an Inertial Navigation System? How does it work?","23200","","<p>In <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/2274/609"">this question</a>, the answer notes that some ADS-B systems are connected to Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), and says they are less accurate than GPS.  What exactly is an INS?  </p>

<p>A couple sub questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is it less accurate?   </li>
<li>The other post mentions they tend to
develop biases as they get older, why is that? </li>
<li>Are they being phased
out?  Or are they used as backup?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Inertial Navigation Systems, unlike other navigation systems, do not depend on external (radio) measurements. Instead an INS keeps track of its position by accurately measuring acceleration (accelerometers) and rotation (gyroscopes). It therefore works in remote areas where there are no ground based navaids available. </p>

<p>Initially, the INS gets its position from pilot input at the gate, or in more recent systems from GPS, sometimes even during flight. By measuring all the accelerations and rotations and integrating them into speed and direction the position is tracked. In doing this, the INS has to correct for the rotation of the earth and the related Coriolis force. </p>

<p>Due to small inaccuracies in the measurements the velocity error and, with that, the position errors grow over time. </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> has quite a detailed article about the history and working of the INS.</p>

<p>While raw INS position has mainly been replaced by GPS measurements on oceanic flights, the system is not being phased out. GPS is a sensitive systems and by crosschecking it with INS, errors can be detected in both systems. It is often used as a backup to GPS. </p>

<p>Integrated GPS / INS systems provide better systems integrity and allow the navigation system to coast through short GPS outages with high accuracies. In addition to that, the (laser) gyroscopes of the INS are often used to provide data to the digital artificial horizon displays in the cockpit and to the auto flight systems. In this case the term Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) is used, which acts as a basis for the INS.</p>

"Why is the maximum speed of current fighter aircraft lower than those from the 1960's and 1970's?","23123","","<p>While reading about the characteristics of the newest fighter aircraft, I observed that their maximum speed is lower than of the aircraft in the same roles half a century ago.</p>

<p>For example, the iconic F-14 and Mig-25 have a higher maximum speed than their modern equivalents.</p>

<p>After the Cold War ended, the major air forces are only engaged in ground support and bombing against low-tech opponents who use asymmetrical warfare, and no modern scenario would see the top fighter aircraft directly engaging each other any time soon. However, for any fighter aircraft in the interceptor role, I would expect speed should be an important characteristic. Also, military aircraft are designed and introduced over a long time period, and are expected to be used for many decades. </p>

<p>Why did maximum speed become less important? Wouldn't it be easier to design even faster fighters now than with the technology available 50 years ago?</p>
","<p>Speed was life in air combat until the jet age. The pilots who became Air Force generals in the Fifties had learned their trade in the Thirties when speed was the most-desired quality in a fighter. Naturally, the ability to be faster than any adversary was very important to them. When the requirements for new fighter aircraft were written in the Fifties, those generals made sure that a higher top speed was part of the specification.</p>

<p>When those supersonic-capable aircraft were used in real conflicts, something very surprising and unforeseen happened: They did hardly ever fly supersonic. When the Air Force in the late Sixties accumulated the flight data from several years of Vietnam war air combat, they found that all aircraft had accumulated just minutes at Mach 1.4 and only seconds at Mach 1.6 out of more than 100,000 combat sorties¹. Never was even Mach 1.8 flown in aircraft which had been optimized for Mach 2.4 (F-104, F-105, F-106A, F-4D/E and F-111).</p>

<p>To cite from this study why speed stayed mostly subsonic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first of these reasons lies in the shape of the turn rate vs Mach number relationship for an aircraft. […] In combat, each pilot has the tendency to to fly his aircraft so as to maximize his turn rate. He thus gains angular position on the enemy which, in turn, may permit a missile launch or a gun firing. […] It can be seen that the pilot's urge to maximize his turn rate will unfailingly drive his Mach number to about 0.7. Thus, if the pilot is going to join in combat, […] his speed will inevitably drop to subsonic speeds. […]
  Note also, that even if the turn rate is held constant while increasing the speed, […] the turn radius and load factor increase, bringing with it increasing problems of keeping the enemy in sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second reason given in the study is the dramatically smaller <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_radius"" rel=""noreferrer"">combat radius</a> (the maximum distance the airplane can travel from its base, accomplish an objective and return) once the aircraft starts to fly at supersonic speeds. Even for flying into the combat arena supersonic speed was rarely advantageous. Northrop studied a multitude of intercept cases and found that speeds above Mach 1.1 were almost never helpful because they curtailed the combat radius severely.</p>

<p>Now you need to know that the top speed is an important driver in airframe design. Flying at Mach 2+ requires <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9066/why-cant-jet-engines-operate-with-supersonic-air-and-how-do-they-slow-it-down/9222?s=5%7C0.1494#9222"">heavy and complex intakes</a>, a heat-resistant structure, high wing sweep and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/17706/how-does-a-supersonic-jet-engine-differ-from-a-subsonic-jet-engine/18729?s=12%7C0.2316#18729"">heavy, low-bypass engines</a>. This all degrades the combat qualities at high subsonic speed, which was where those aircraft were used the most. Building into them the capacity for Mach 2+ made them worse for what they were actually used for.</p>

<p>From the late Sixties on this lesson was incorporated into the newer designs like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon"" rel=""noreferrer"">F-16</a>. Stealth again decreased the importance of supersonic capability, and the maximum sustained speed of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor"" rel=""noreferrer"">F-22</a> was actually reduced from Mach 1.8 to Mach 1.6 to reduce the heat load on the composite wing leading edge.</p>

","<p>With respect to avionics and fault logs, flight legs is just one more data point. It's not any more important than any other piece of data, but it does have value. Avionics are not structure and don't care as much about pressurization cycles, but it can be a factor - the pressure change between sea level and 8000 cabin altitude does have some effect. It's just that avionics can easily count flight legs and it makes for an easy way to organize the fault logs along with flight phase.  </p>

<p>It is useful data when trying to find the root cause of an intermittent fault in a piece of avionics.  Fault logs typically log at least 20 legs before they ""roll over"" and overwrite old data.  With some aircraft flying 6 or more legs a day, that ensures the plane can get to a base with maintenance before the fault gets overwritten.  </p>

<p>The value is the ability to help detect patterns.  I've seen faults that only occur on the first leg of the day after the plane was parked overnight at a very humid airport. Re-creating the conditions allowed us to duplicate the fault. The problem was a flaw in the conformal coating (sealant) on a circuit card that allowed moisture to cause a short.  Once the unit had operated for an hour or so, the heat had dried it out and it worked fine.  </p>

"Why does it take so long to develop modern military jets?","22890","","<p>In the 1960's, it took three years to produce a flying prototype of an aircraft that flew faster than anything before, was built out of a novel construction material, used a new type of fuel, and was incredibly advanced: the Lockheed A-12. Its successor the SR-71 was the first aircraft with stealth technology applied, and stayed in service for decades.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMS3g.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMS3g.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_A-12"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> page of the A-12:</p>

<ul>
<li>March 1959: a pre-design <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_A-12#/media/File:LockheedA-11.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drawing</a> differing from the final configuration</li>
<li>26 January 1960: order of 12 A-12 aircraft  </li>
<li>25 April 1962: first flight of the prototype. </li>
</ul>

<p>The F-35 program is a modern day jet platform program. It took 5 years to develop and build a winning prototype, and then 5 years for first flight of a production machine. It has been in the news for years for delays and cost overruns - latest problem is with the <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com.au/f-35-hypoxia-luke-afb-oxygen-problem-2017-6?r=US&amp;IR=T"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oxygen system</a>.</p>

<p>From its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The JSF development contract was signed on 16 November 1996,</li>
<li>26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin, whose X-35 beat X-32</li>
<li>15 December 2006 F-35 first flight</li>
<li>In 2012, General Norton A. Schwartz decried the ""foolishness"" of reliance on computer models to arrive at the final design of aircraft before flight testing has found the problems that require changes in design.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to the uninitiated, it seems like half a century ago, the awesomest plane on earth could be delivered for service three years after finalising design. The successor SR-71 was developed in 2 years, had the addition of the side chimes for reducing radar cross-section, and was so much ahead of its time that it could stay in service for decades. Now, it takes 10 years from contract sign to first flight of a production machine that remains experiencing design problems until the present day, and then a further 10 years to debug all problems.</p>

<p>The A-12 engineers faced very complicated problems as well, yet they could solve them in record time. What am I missing? Why does development take so much longer?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>How about this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase.</li>
<li>The first YF-16 was rolled out on 13 December 1973, and its 90-minute maiden flight was made at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB, California, on 2 February 1974.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update: the answer. -- Updated update: more would make the question too long, I've added an answer.</strong></p>

<p>Multiple very good answers list the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer types expected to take on more roles</li>
<li>Lack of competition</li>
<li>No urgency imposed by war</li>
<li>Therefore, no work force experienced in rapid solving of extremely complicated problems</li>
<li>Peace-time politics having to justify budget decisions to the voters.</li>
<li>Better testing and greater safety imposing more time demands.</li>
</ul>

<p>All are very good points. The light attack aircraft with short development time is illustrative, as is <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/16886851"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article in The Economist.</p>

<p>I still have great difficulty in accepting that: </p>

<ul>
<li>A reason would be the complexity of the problem, which is very often quoted. All aerospace problems are extremely complex, that is nothing new. But now nobody can tackle them anymore? That was the basis of my question.</li>
<li><s>Having fewer airframe types saves cost and/or development time, this seems evidently incorrect.</s> Pointed out in @Hephaestus Aetnaean's answer </li>
<li>It should cost <em>twenty</em> years to properly develop an aircraft. Upgrades during the life cycle, sure. On the number of lines of code as reason, <a href=""http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> is some perspective. 8 Million Lines Of Code (MLOC) compares with Firefox and the Chevy Volt, 24 MLOC with Apache Open Office.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Additional points are made below - by writing in big black letters. Not sure if that makes the point more valid.</p>

<p>Cost-wise, the F-35 indeed beats <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine%27s_laws"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Augustine's</a> law XVI. The <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/16886851"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> in The Economist from 2010 referenced above has the predicted F-35 in the plot, according to @Hephaestus Aetnaean the cost is even lower, just below the $10^8$ dollar line:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qmajh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qmajh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So the year in which all of the US defence budget can buy only one aircraft may be postponed from predicted 2054 to maybe 2074?</p>

<p>Development time wise (which is what the question is about), it is pointed out that F-35 development time is 2.5 times F-16 time. That is a big leap in a bit over two decades. Yes development time of European jets is long as well, perhaps due to smaller defence budget of smaller countries? Ironic that they are setting the standard in this.</p>

<p>Long software development time - has software engineering not developed methods to tackle large complicated problems? Especially where the problem - and solutions - increase incrementally? Does better testing and off-line simulation not allow for decoupling off of the project critical path, and therefore save time instead of requiring more? I opened up a question on Stack Exchange Software Engineering, and they mention that FireFox has 20 millon lines of code.</p>

<p>I don't want to knock the F-35, it's indeed an awesome platform. If it ends up a capable platform for a reasonable price, that is great and I wish all the best to pilots carrying out their mission in service of their country. And perhaps the long development time and multiple news items remain only a memory.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong></p>

<p>Too long to include in a question edit, refer to my answer below.</p>
","<p>First of all, it took at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_A-12#Design_and_development"" rel=""noreferrer"">five years</a> even back then, but your observation is absolutely correct. You  would need to go back one more decade to find a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk"" rel=""noreferrer"">frontline fighter</a> that was designed within two years.</p>

<p>The reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Urgency: Back then, the Cold War arms race forced both sides to continuously improve. Together with the advances in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/23117/why-is-the-nose-of-the-mig-21-shaped-so-differently-compared-to-other-fighter-ai/23127#23127"">weapons</a> and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21987/why-is-the-maximum-speed-of-current-fighter-aircraft-lower-than-those-from-the-1/21988#21988"">tactics</a>, this meant that upgrading older airframes did not suffice.</li>
<li>A trained workforce: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21544/what-do-aircraft-designers-like-burt-rutan-do-to-cheaply-practice-geting-good-at/21557#21557"">Experienced</a> engineers back then had worked on a dozen new designs (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer)#Aircraft_contributions"" rel=""noreferrer"">or more</a>), so they had developed a gut feeling how to design the next one. Today, one can be lucky to have brought a single one into the air within a lifetime.</li>
<li>Complexity: As aircraft become <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14354/are-strategic-bombers-still-useful-or-are-fighters-taking-over-this-role/14362#14362"">ever more expensive</a>, their specs are mulled over for years. The time it takes to write today's specs is reflected in the sometimes contradicting demands put on a new design. Every new design has to be a Jack of all trades which will increase development time. A lot.</li>
<li>Culture: Today's culture is very risk-averse. Contrast that to the Fifties, when the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_F-100_Super_Sabre"" rel=""noreferrer"">F-100</a> went supersonic on its second test flight and went on to be involved into 889 accidents, causing the death of 324 pilots over its operational career. Design and testing was much less thorough, leaving more complicated effects like flutter or fatigue to chance and accepting others like dangerous stall characteristics. Today, we evaluate and test much more because we can and try to avoid mishaps at almost all cost. That takes time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't stress the importance of the second point enough. When the first aerodynamic dataset for the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25310/why-do-all-new-european-fighter-jets-have-delta-wings/25318#25318"">TKF-90</a> was sent to the simulation guys at MBB, it was rejected because the coefficients were obviously ""wrong"". As it turned out, the guy in simulation had spent his entire career with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavia_Tornado"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tornado</a> data, so this was all he knew. In my time, I tried to lobby for a cheap design just to keep people trained, but got nowhere with the beancounters running the company. For them, every engineer was the same. In their eyes, experience can be judged by an engineer's degree and company-funded training is a waste of money. See, the training issue goes all the way up to the top! If even the bosses have little idea what it takes to design a good aircraft quickly, you get what we have today.</p>

<p>Note that complexity not only concerns the airframe. Modern programs are mostly multinational and spread over as many constituencies as possible. The amount of coordination of such an artificially increased workforce is immense. Also, testing all states of a complex airframe takes much more time and risk management means that quick trials are impossible. Back then, the strategy was mostly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_X-3_Stiletto"" rel=""noreferrer"">trial</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_DH_108"" rel=""noreferrer"">error</a>, whereas today every program is tested to death to avoid any failure.</p>

<p>Have you ever read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine%27s_laws"" rel=""noreferrer"">Augustine's Laws</a>? This is a great book with a lot of profound insights into the military aviation business. And when even the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_R._Augustine"" rel=""noreferrer"">CEO of Lockheed</a> cannot make a dent in the system even though he has demonstrated a deep understanding of its faults, you know how little can be changed.</p>

<p>Because you used the SR-71 as an example: This combines all points in the extreme.</p>

<ul>
<li>After the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident"" rel=""noreferrer"">U-2 incident</a> and without working satellites, urgency was extreme. People worked almost around the clock to get the new design into operation. Contrast this with today where a flight test is postponed for the slightest risk. Delays? Who cares!</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kelly Johnson</a> hand-picked the best engineers from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California#Aviation"" rel=""noreferrer"">Burbank</a> offices and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/22765/why-did-the-cl-400-suntan-have-engines-on-the-ends-of-its-wings/22767#22767"">had been working on Mach 3 designs</a> for almost a decade before. Also, the most time-consuming detail of the Blackbird family of aircraft, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_J58"" rel=""noreferrer"">their engine</a>, was ready when he started. I remember from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rich"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ben Rich</a>'s autobiography that Kelly could predict the heat load of a shockwave with only a few degrees of error just by guessing back then. To develop this kind of experience takes a lot of wind tunnel data! And he had almost complete liberty to decide how to proceed. No beancounter dared to second-guess his decisions. Compare that with today …</li>
<li>The Blackbird family of aircraft was meant to do one thing only. Fly fast. No demands on turn rate, field length or a wide variety of external loads. Also no dozens of mission profiles, high and low, loiter and penetration, air superiority and bombing with one platform. That helped to get it out the door quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>That the Blackbird family was not replaced by something better was caused by … wait for it … the ever <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Isinglass"" rel=""noreferrer"">increasing cost of new designs</a>. It simply was the last in a long line.</p>

"Why are planes slower at higher altitudes?","22775","","<p>On many flight simulators, I have noticed that planes tends to get slower with increasing altitude. For example, I can reach 1100 knots just above the sea level in Google Earth flight simulator(F16), but only about 400 knots at 11km with the same plane.</p>
","<p>This is because what you are looking at is the IAS indicator (Indicated Air Speed).
This represents the amount of relative air which flows over and under the wings of the plane. This is what creates <strong>lift</strong> and enables the plane to fly. This is why this instrument is so important and belongs to the primary flight instruments.</p>

<p>This is not to be confused with GS (Ground Speed), which can be sensed by IRS (Intertial Reference System), or by the GPS. Ground Speed is not relevant to pilot an aircraft, but it's still useful for example to determine the ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival), and for fuel estimation during flight.</p>

<p><strong>The IAS indicator indicates a lower speed because the more you climb, the less air there is.</strong> So even the air flows faster, the global pressure feeling is lower.</p>

<p>So, actually <strong>planes are not slower at higher altitudes</strong>. They are faster (at least most planes whose flight envelope force them to fly faster when they are higher, otherwise they would stall, because they would have to increase their Angle of Attack too much to counterbalance the lack of air flowing above and under the wings). But when they reach their target Mach speed, their speed will decrease slowly as the outside air temperature is decreasing until end of climb.</p>

<p>Sorry for the picture being in French... But as you can see, the flight envelope of an airliner forces him to actually fly faster as it is climbing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Different speeds</h1>

<p>There are different speeds on an aircraft, and it can be quite confusing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>IAS (Indicated Airspeed)</strong> is what the instruments directly sense. It is computed by subtracting the static pressure (static ports are placed on the fuselage, vertically to relative airflow) from the total pressure (pitot tubes are placed parallel to relative airflow. This gives a <strong>measured dynamic pressure</strong> which is then displayed in knots, km/h or mp/h. This speed is showed on most general aviation aircrafts as the main speed indication (but it's actually not a speed and more a 'pressure of air feeling').</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CAS (Calibrated Airspeed)</strong> is the same as IAS, but without instrument errors. It gives a speed related to the <strong><em>real</em> dynamic pressure</strong> felt by the aircraft. This speed is showed on most airliners as the main speed indication (for pilot and autopilot).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TAS (True Airspeed)</strong> is the same as CAS when at 15°C, 0% humidity, 1013,25 hPa (29.92 inHg) (ISA, International Standard Atmosphere). This time it is literally the air speed (speed of the air): it is the <strong><em>real</em> speed at which the relative air flows around the aircraft</strong>. It takes into account the fact that air density is not always the same. This speed is used when measuring or referring to an aircraft performance during cruise for example. It is also used during flight planning before the wind has been taken into account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GS (Ground Speed)</strong> is the speed of the aircraft relative to the surface of the Earth (the equivalent of the speed showed in a car). In an airplane, we cannot use wheel speed to measure it because we are in the air, so we need GPS or IRS to do this. If there is no wind outside, TAS and GS are the same. If there is 30kt tailwind, GS is 30kt higher than TAS. This speed is used to know when you will arrive at your destination airport, and to know if you will have enough fuel (because the wind is taken into account). This speed is also used when the aircraft is on the ground (when taxiing, or more generally at low speeds when wheels are on the ground). Airlines or airports fix speed limitations when taxiing. The only way to know if you respect the limits is to look at the Ground Speed. Also, the airspeed indicator usually won't be active below a certain speed (45KIAS for the B737).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, why is the primary airspeed indication (IAS or CAS) the wrong speed (not actual speed) of the air flowing around the aircraft?
This is because this wrong airspeed represents actually <strong>the real pressure feeling</strong> around the wings that is <strong>responsible for the lift</strong>. It is this parameter that we need as pilot and it is used in aircraft manuals to describe the V-speeds. It's perfect that IAS and CAS are not corrected with altitude and temperature, because if we know that our airplane stalls at 120kts for example, we won't need to care about altitude or temperature. Our airplane will stall at that same speed regardless of altitude and temperature. If we would use TAS, stall speed would be constantly changing and it would be more difficult to keep the aircraft in good and safe flying conditions.</p>

<p>Trouble is that not all windsocks are calibrated the same way. <strong>How do I find out what wind velocity will bring my airport windsock to a fully erect state?</strong></p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kUsD.jpg"" alt=""Wind Sock""></p>

<p>The stripes are actually useful:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The first stripe indicates a 3-knot breeze<br>
(The wind sock has turned and aligned with the wind - usually you should look for an anemometer near the wind sock to determine if there's any appreciable wind because often the first segment is held open by the frame.)</li>
<li>The second stripe is ~ 6 knots</li>
<li>The third stripe is ~ 9 knots</li>
<li>The fourth stripe is ~ 12 knots</li>
<li>The last stripe is 15 knots or higher</li>
<li>If the windsock is missing you probably shouldn't be at the airport.</li>
<li>If the pole is missing you're probably on your way to Oz.</li>

"What do the terms 'holding out' and 'common carriage' mean?","22604","","<p>A pilot with a new commercial certificate is excited at the new world of getting-paid-to-fly they have opened up.  That is, until their instructor or good friend reminds them of 14 CFR 119 and the grey line that separates operations that do or do not require an operating certificate.</p>

<p>It is cut and dry that a commercial pilot can be paid to do certain things, but when you decide you are going to start doing things for a friend (""yea, I can transport XYZ for you on my next trip to Kalamazoo"") things start to get murky. Especially once your friend starts paying you, you make a habit of transporting things and he tells his friends about your service.</p>

<p>At what point are you holding out your services to the public and when do you cross the line from private carriage into common carriage?  How far can you go without an operating certificate.  </p>

<p>I'm looking for regulatory answers or anything written from a FSDO, basically anything not anecdotal.  </p>
","<p>Oddly enough, ""common carriage"" is not defined in the FAR's, but that is because it is a ""common law term"" and not specific to aviation.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22647"">AC120-12A - Private Carriage Versus Common Carriage of Persons or Property</a> contains guidance that can be used to help determine whether or not an operation falls under common carriage.  Take a look at it for specific examples, but the ""plain language"" version is:</p>

<p><strong>Common Carriage:</strong> A carrier becomes a common carrier when it ""holds itself out"" to the public, or to a segment of the public.</p>

<p><strong>Holding Out:</strong>  A carrier is holding out when they represent themselves as willing to furnish transportation within the limits of its facilities to any person who wants it.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to ""hold out"", but the basic idea is if <em>someone in the general public comes to you</em> and asks you to fly them and you agree, you are probably holding out.  Any form of advertising demonstrates a clear sign that you are holding out.  There are also other activities that qualify, so look over the AC if you have further questions, and if that doesn't answer it your best bet is to contact an aviation lawyer.  You could also contact your local FSDO with questions.</p>

<hr>

<p>As far as transporting a third part for hire, both common and private carriage require an air carrier certificate issued under 125 or 135 depending on the size of the airplane<sup>1</sup>. This means that your trip for a friend would be in violation because you don't have the required air carrier operating certificate.  (Thank you @p1l0t for clarifying this for me!)</p>

"Could an electric engine provide the same performance as jet engines on current aircraft?","22399","","<p>I have looked at various questions on this SE site regarding this topic but I have not really found a satisfactory answer. Some comments <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9940/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-ducted-fans-in-designs-such-as-the/9949#comment19200_9949"">here</a> regarding torque and power in electric motors vs gasoline engines were helpful. Additional info also found <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/19569/how-many-kilowatts-to-get-an-electric-747-8-airborne"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Underlying my question is the assumption that battery technology will considerably advance from what is available commercially now. Simply assume that providing the electric motor with enough power is not an issue and that the weight of the battery is equal to fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to build an electric aircraft engine that would allow current commercial airplanes the same capabilities as jet engines available today do?</strong></p>
","<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>To look at a medium-range aircraft, let's base the engine on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFM_International_CFM56"" rel=""noreferrer"">CFM56</a> or the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAE_V2500"" rel=""noreferrer"">IAE V2500</a>. Those engines produce between 100 and 150 kN static thrust. In cruise, their thrust is <a href=""https://engineering.purdue.edu/~propulsi/propulsion/jets/tfans/cfm56.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">considerably lower</a> due to the low density in cruise altitude and due to them moving at Mach 0.8. Let's use a value of 25 kN - this is enough so that two of them will comfortably push an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family"" rel=""noreferrer"">A320</a> class airframe through the thin air at altitude.</p>

<p>The power to produce such an amount of thrust is force times speed. The speed when flying with Mach 0.8 in <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=speed%20of%20sound%20at%2035000%20ft%20altitude"" rel=""noreferrer"">35.000 ft</a> is 240 m/s, so the power produced by one engine is 6.0 MW. Now <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio#Electric_motors.2FElectromotive_generators"" rel=""noreferrer"">let's look up how big and heavy</a> an electric motor has to be to produce 6 MW continuously. As you can see from the linked Wikipedia page, the results are all over the place. Big, industrial motors come in at less than 1 kW/kg, so our motor would weigh more than 6 tons. The smaller motors for electric airplanes are pushing 10 kW/kg, the power-to-weight ratio of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_GE90"" rel=""noreferrer"">GE90 turbofan</a>, but will lose some of that when scaled up to size. Remember, even at 98% efficiency the motor will generate 120 kW of heat - this needs to be removed, and operating in thin air doesn't make this easy.</p>

<p>With current technology the motor could achieve maybe 2 to 3 kW/kg - this means the motor driving our hypothetical engine comes in at 2 to 3 tons. Add to this the fan and the fairing of the jet engine (we will not need the high-pressure part and all the turbines), but double the fan weight because we need to compensate for the missing high-energy core flow. This will maybe weigh 50% of the CFM56 / V2500, so we need to add another 1.2 tons.</p>

<p>The electric motor will be twice as heavy as the parts it replaces. There is still some work to do before it can gain an advantage over current jet engines, but it has some potential because it does not dump half of the energy supplied to it overboard in a hot, fast-moving, noisy gas stream.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Since so many people get excited about me omitting the energy density aspect of electric propulsion, even though the question did expressly desire to leave this out, here are <strong>two</strong> things to consider. Energy density is only half of the problem of electric storage.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials"" rel=""noreferrer"">energy density</a> of jet fuel is around 43 MJ/kg, while Lithium polymer batteries achieve not even one MJ/kg. But this comparison is linear thinking - realistically, the current will be produced either by a high-efficiency turbine-generator combination, or by fuel cells, burning hydrogen at twice the efficiency of a conventional jet engine. Since hydrogen packs 142 MJ per kilogram, at twice the efficiency the electric airliner would need only 162 kg of hydrogen for every ton of kerosene in a conventional jet. Yes, I know, even then its volume will still be a problem.</li>
<li>If any form of batteries is used, the fact that empty batteries weigh as much as full ones is the final nail in the coffin of battery-powered flight. While your average long-range jet <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_fraction"" rel=""noreferrer"">lands at 60% of its take-off weight</a>, the battery-powered jet would need to schlepp those heavy batteries all the way to the final destination. To be competitive, those hypothetical batteries would need to have <strong>twice</strong> the energy density of kerosene.</li>

"What do the callouts ""approaching minimums"" and ""minimums "" mean?","22389","","<p>When landing, what exactly do the phrases ""approaching minimums"" and ""minimums"" mean in a commercial jet aircraft,  when heard from the onboard cockpit voice.</p>
","<p>The ""Approaching Minimums"" callout is made by the Pilot Monitoring (or, in some cases equipment, the GPWS -- Ground Proximity Warning System) as the aircraft is descending on an instrument approach and has reached an altitude 100 feet above the minimums for that approach -- the Decision Altitude (DA -- typically used for a Cat I ILS, and set as XXX' MSL) or Decision Height (DH -- typically used for a Cat II or Cat III ILS and set as XXX' or XX' on the Radio Altimeter) or Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA -- typically used for a nonprecision approach and set as XXX' MSL).  The response by the Pilot Flying is usually standardized and indicates he is looking outside in order to acquire the visual references he'll need to land.</p>

<p>The ""Minimums"" callout is made at the minimum altitude, and this is the point that the Pilot Flying has to make a decision -- continue or go around.  His response at this point is again standardized so that the other pilot is entirely clear on the course of action.  His response is usually something like ""Landing"" or ""Continue"", or else ""Go Around.""  Often, the autopilot comes off at this point as well &amp; you hear the horn indicating such on the CVR as well.</p>

"How do jet fighters get to war?","22354","","<p>Currently Australia is <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-18/prime-minister-to-farewell-troops-at-williamtown-raaf-base/5753396"">deploying F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to the UAE</a> to fight in Iraq. Obviously the UAE (and Iraq) is a very long way from Australia and well beyond the typical range of one of these aircraft.</p>

<p>On TV they literally showed the Australian Prime Minister waving goodbye while the jets took off and flew into the distance, which for some reason seemed odd and made me wonder about how fighter jets are typically ferried to a distant war.</p>

<p>I kind of assumed they were loaded onto an aircraft carrier and shipped there, but Australia doesn't have an aircraft carrier so obviously this isn't the case.</p>

<p>I assume they must therefore fly, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they fly hop to hop within their usual range refuelling at each stop? Where would these stops be? I assume they can't just refuel at a civilian airport in an arbitrary country and would have to be an air force base belonging to a close ally.</li>
<li>Do they fly continuously with aerial refuelling? Does the tanker need to make hops to refuel?</li>
<li>Do they swap their weapons for extended fuel tanks which provide enough range to fly continuously to the UAE?</li>
<li>Are they actually shipped via regular military cargo ship and the ""departure"" on TV just for show?</li>
<li>If they do fly continuously, it seems like flying non-stop for ~13 hours in a cramped fighter pilot cockpit would be unreasonable (even commercial pilots take shifts), or would they fly supersonic and perhaps reduce this to 5 or 6 hours?</li>
</ul>

<p>Answers don't necessarily have to be Australia -> UAE specific, I'd also be interested to know how the US deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan for example and if the process is consistent or depends on the aircraft and location.</p>
","<p>To answer the list in order:</p>

<p><strong>Do they fly hop to hop?</strong></p>

<p>An F-18 can go 3,000km unloaded (ordnance adds a <em>lot</em> of drag) and that's plenty from Australia. You can get to the Middle East in 4 hops, no air-to-air refuelling required. Although if you do an in-flight top-up you can add more than the regular range because you don't need to burn any fuel getting back up to cruise altitude.</p>

<p><strong>Where would these stops be? Surely not at civilian airports?</strong></p>

<p>Military aircraft often use civilian airports - they run on Jet-A just like everything else. Fighters were not an uncommon sight at the general-aviation terminal where I'm from. Loaded warplanes are a political issue, unloaded ones are a good day's business for the airport's fuel merchants. (note that fighters are almost never completely unloaded - the ammunition for the gun has a significant effect on the airplane's trim. But you can't see it.)</p>

<p>An external fuel tank can be added in place of weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Are they actually shipped via regular military cargo ship?</strong></p>

<p>Fixed-wing aircraft are typically not boxed for surface shipping. Helicopters are - no wings to remove and rotors can be folded up very easily.
Carrier-based aircraft will depart from land - the only way you get a Hornet off of a docked carrier is with a crane, so they typically launch everything when still offshore, and load the aircraft the same way on departure.</p>

<p>The USA has enough carriers that they would not deploy a carrier-based fleet like this. If they are adding / replacing aircraft there are probably enough already in Europe - send those where needed and replace them in the normal course of events.</p>

<p><strong>Would they fly supersonic to reduce travel time?</strong></p>

<p>No, they won't go supersonic to reduce the flight time. > Mach 1 consumes so much fuel you'd never get there. Fighters have supersonic capability so they can get there or run away as needed, but it's never used for very long. The Concorde was designed from the beginning for Mach 2 cruise, so it didn't use afterburners once at Mach 2. Subsonic flight suffered as a result, fighters would not accept the subsonic flight handling issues as that's rather important to them :-)</p>

<p>Bombers are often deployed directly from home bases. All modern strategic bombers have global range with in-flight refuelling. You don't leave North Dakota, blow up something in Longwayfromherestan and get home for dinner, but you don't land anywhere else either. Yes, it's many hours in the same seat but the military crews are used to it.</p>

"How do pilots manage to keep aircraft on centerline during taxi?","22157","","<p>Cockpits usually seem to have windows that are high up and it doesn't seem from pictures that they would allow a pilot to look down so easily while sitting in their seat. Please correct me if that is wrong because that is the basic assumption of this question.</p>

<p>Then how do pilots know where the centerline is on the taxiway and runway? They always seem to taxi with nose wheel almost always on that line even when turning. Are there some instruments that help them? Or its the same logic as in a car as to how you find out where the lines are?</p>
","<p>Aligning yourself in the middle of a straight taxiway isn't a problem. On the 747, if you put yourself in the middle of the taxiway as you see it beyond the nose, you'll be in good shape. If you're the captain, you can hold yourself a little left of the perceived center, but not much, because you're looking at from an eye level over 30 feet up as I remember. If the taxiway has those little metal reflectors sticking up on the centerline, you can play games trying to keep one of the nose wheels hitting them. You can just barely feel going across them. Or, since the nose gear is two wheels, you can play with getting the reflectors between the two wheels if you're really bored.</p>

<p>Turns on a taxiway present a bit more of a challenge insofar as keeping the center line because the nose gear is behind you, but one develops a feel for it. A 90 degree turn from a narrow taxiway onto another narrow taxiway is a little challenging, especially if the taxiway you're on T's into the one you're turning onto. All you'll see out the front window as you start the turn is grass. Also, on narrow taxiways, you can't see the taxiway out the side window from your normal sitting position.</p>

<p>If you need to do a 180 on a runway, you need to remember that when you first get yourself on, say, the right side of the runway, the nose gear isn't there yet, and the wing and body gear have even further to go.  You have to run yourself along the side of the runway a sufficient distance so that the airplane is aligned with the edge of the runway before you start your turn.</p>

<p>Personally, I found taxiing a 747 one of the more fun things in life.</p>

<p>Given that a plane may need to fly from one country to another, is there any standardisation across the globe? Does planes manufactured by Boeing use one system and planes made by the Airbus another system? If not, wouldn't it be very easy for pilots to make calculation error?</p>
","<p>Outside US, SI is generally used for <strong>everything except altitude, distance and speed</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Altitude: 1000 ft happens to be reasonable vertical separation, which is somewhat easier to calculate with than the corresponding metric figure 300 m.</li>
<li>Distance: There are two quantities that were never converted to decimal. Time and <em>angle</em>. Since we didn't switch to gradians, it makes sense to keep nautical mile, which corresponds to 1 minute along meridian or equator, as it makes calculating distances from navigational maps somewhat easier. If the maps were marked in gradian coordinates, 1 gradian would be 100 km and kilometres would be used.</li>
<li>Speed: Obviously based on the unit of distance in use.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States (most former Soviet countries) and China (and I am not sure whether some other Asian countries), metric system is used for everything. I believe in Russia they recently switched to flight levels based on feet, but they do use metres below transition altitude.</p>

<p>Before second world war, aircraft built in continental Europe usually had instruments in metric units as well. However before the war aviation was more advanced in the USA, instrument procedures were developed in USA and after the war there was surplus of US-built planes, so most of the world just adopted the US procedures including the units they used as everybody using the same units was more important than any personal preferences. Without these reasons we'd be probably using metric in Europe for everything too.</p>

"Flying in a helicopter with open doors: why don't people fall out?","21978","","<p>This has been puzzling for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Every action movie or military documentary features helicopters with no door or with open doors and yet people inside look like they couldn't care less. Apparently they're not falling out...</p>

<p>Why is it so?</p>
","<p>Aircraft, fixed-wing or rotorcraft, have limited capability to produce a sideways force, so they simply can't throw you out.</p>

<p>It is a matter of physics. Inertial forces (gravity and centrifugal force) act on you and the aircraft the same, so they won't make you move relative to the aircraft. The only force between you and the seat is caused by the aerodynamic forces. And the wing or rotor can only produce significant force vertically, and some torque with help of control surfaces. But for lateral force there is only drag of the fuselage and the vertical stabilizer and, in most helicopters, anti-torque rotor, which don't produce that much force unless there is really bad turbulence or in some cases if the handling is really bad.</p>

<p>When aircraft turns, it banks to be able to produce the necessary side force, so the resulting force is still mostly straight to the floor.</p>

<p>Of course the other reason is that all aircraft and helicopters have seat-belts and the people sitting by open door usually have them on—except for skydivers, who have the parachute on already, and rescue divers who are tied to the winch instead.</p>

"Can the Airbus A380 safely fly with two engines out on the same wing?","21931","","<p>I know twin-engine jets can safely take off and fly with one engine out (i.e. all thrust only on one side).  Of course quad-engine jets are also able to fly safely in case one engine is out.</p>

<p>Would the rudder be able to compensate the thrust imbalance?</p>

<p>Note: Two engines out on the same wing is not a very likely scenario, but it's not impossible.  For example, on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas_Flight_32"">Qantas 32</a>, damage from the number 2 engine explosion impacted fuel and control lines of engine 1.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, jet fuel is typically not safe. When I, as a complete outsider, hear of fuel dumping, I imagine a whole bunch of dangerous corrosive fuel being dropped on whatever happens to be below, and it sounds like a frankly awful idea.</p>

<p>Dumping fuel sounds dangerous but it is not.  It is not going to explode.  Jet-A can be compared to kerosene and I don't have that statistic so let's compare it to Diesel Fuel which is not dissimilar to Jet-A.  Diesel Fuel at 400&deg;F(204&deg;C) is as volatile as gasoline is at 70&deg;F(21&deg;C).  Obviously that is a big difference.

","<p>They are flaps or doors on the engine cowling that open up in order to provide increased cooling airflow for the engine. <a href=""http://cdn.avweb.com/media/newspics//piper_twin_cowl_flap.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">They look like this</a> when open. They are generally controlled by a handle in the cockpit (some aircraft have electric cowl flaps with an open/close switch).</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that the open flaps also increase drag. So on airplanes equipped with cowl flaps, they are generally opened for low-speed, high-power situations such as takeoff. This is the harshest operational regime for the engine since it is at its highest power and relatively low cooling airflow due to low airspeed. They are then closed either reaching cruise or reaching a point where the airplane can transition to a lower-power, higher-speed climb profile.</p>

<p>They're not specific to radial engines, but do tend to be more common in older aircraft (there are exceptions though). Newer airplane and engine designs are more likely to have sufficient inherent cooling airflow to not require cowl flaps.</p>

Wait until you're established on course, in a cruise-attitude (instead of a climb), and everything is settled and running smoothly.  Then know your position, and how you're going to report it.

"What does ""Information <letter>"" in ATC transmissions mean?","21410","","<p>When listening to ATC broadcasting (at least for ULLI), phrase <code>""Information &lt;Charlie|India|whiskey|etc.&gt; on board""</code> may be heard. Charlie, India, Whiskey, etc. refer to ""C"", ""I"", ""W"" but what do these codes mean? What kind of information is this?</p>
","<p>This is a simple versioning system used in ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service).
ATIS messages contain information about the wheather at the airport, runways in use etc. This information is transmitted on a dedicated radio frequency and repeated in a loop. The ATIS messages are updated frequently as the wheather or operations on the airport change. Every time a new ATIS message is generated, the letter is changed. </p>

<p>Example of an ATIS message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is Schiphol arrival information <strong>Kilo</strong>, main landing runway
  18Right. Transition level 50. Two zero zero degrees, one one knots.
  Visibility 10 kilometres. Few 1300 feet, scattered 1800 feet, broken
  2000 feet. Temperature 15, dewpoint 13. QNH 995 hectopascal. No
  significant change. Contact Approach and Arrival callsign only. End of
  information <strong>Kilo</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now when for example the temperature or pressure at the airport changes, the ATIS information is updated: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is Schiphol arrival information <strong>Lima</strong>, main landing runway
  18Right. Transition level 50. Two zero zero degrees, one two knots.
  Visibility 10 kilometres. Few 1300 feet, scattered 1800 feet, broken
  2000 feet. Temperature 16, dewpoint 13. QNH 994 hectopascal. No
  significant change. Contact Approach and Arrival callsign only. End of
  information <strong>Lima</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The flight crew will listen to the ATIS often before they are in contact with the Air Traffic Control of the airport. They note the information in the ATIS, together with the information version letter. </p>

<p>On first contact with the airport's Air Traffic Control, they will then state what version of the ATIS they have listened to. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Schiphol approach, this is KLM1234 with information Lima.</p>

<p>The Air Traffic Controller can then verify this is the latest version of the ATIS, or if there is newer information available that should be passed on to the flight crew. </p>

"How does an aircraft taxi?","21302","","<p>Does an aircraft use its engines to taxi or is it always pulled by some other vehicle?</p>

<p>I have seen a small lorry pulling it sometimes; is it really pulling the huge thing, or does the aircraft use its own power somehow?</p>
","<p>Aircraft are not always moved with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushback"">tugs</a> (the small vehicle you refer to). Much of the time, they operate under their own power.</p>

<p>Airliners are generally pushed back from the gate using a tug, as that's the simplest and most efficient method. They then taxi to the runway (and all the way up to the gate, after landing) using their own engines to provide thrust. This is true of both jets and propeller aircraft.</p>

<p>Some work is being done on self-contained electric-powered ground propulsion; one major player in this area is a company called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WheelTug"">WheelTug</a>.

"How does the mixture of an engine affect the engine's operation?","21239","","<p>I know that in most piston aircraft that there is a mixture control for the engine. My question is, how does the mixture control affect the engine's operation and what type of situations dictate a particular mixture setting? Would an incorrect mixture setting be detrimental, a minor effect or nothing at all?</p>
","<p>Simple Answer: Running the engine lean or rich at different altitudes.</p>

<p>Longer Answer: There are a couple of reasons you want to adjust the mixture of a aircraft engine.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Since air density changes with altitude, it's a good idea to be able to change the fuel/air mixture at different altitudes.  If you did not adjust the mixture at high altitudes you may not get full power because the air is thinner and now there is same amount of fuel being mixed with less air.  All the unburnt fuel can cause issues like loss of power and/or fouling of plugs.</li>
<li>Being able to lean the mixture at higher altitude lets you save fuel, so you can go further on a full tank.  (hence saving money)</li>
<li>Running a engine rich can help cool engine.  Fuel acts like a coolant in this manner.  Typically on climbing you want to run the engine a bit rich because your going slower and less air is able to help cool the engine.</li>
<li>Traditional piston powered aircraft engines are shut off by pulling the mixture to the off position.  This starves the engine and burns off remaining fuel in the cylinders.</li>
</ol>

<p>This topic can also bring up other discussions.  Like EGT, CHT, running an engine rich of peak or lean of peak, monitoring fuel flow rate with a flow meter, and fuel injectors on fuel injected systems.</p>

"Why is the Cumulonimbus cloud formation so dangerous?","21113","","<p>I once heard my pilot friend say that it's really dangerous to fly near any Cumulonimbus cloud formations... Something about that it could drag the plane into it.</p>

<p>Cumulonimbus :</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O2s15.jpg"" alt=""Image of Cumulonimbus cloud formation""></p>

<ul>
<li>Why is it so dangerous?</li>
<li>How is it created?</li>
</ul>
","<p>A cumulonimbus cloud (CB) is dangerous because of the processes occurring in them.  At a minimum you will have an updraft and a downdraft containing rain.  The particular CB you posted in your picture is typical of severe convection.  The anvil is spreading out along the tropopause and there is significant overshooting tops over the anvil.  This indicates the updraft in this cloud is very strong and there is a lot of energy in this storm.  A storm like this likely has hail near the updraft, very strong winds both up and down and severe turbulence within the interface between and around the strong up/down drafts.  There can also be very active in-cloud lightning as well as cloud-to-ground discharges.  </p>

<p>Threats near the storm are turbulence, lightning, large hail and significant downdrafts (e.g. microbursts).  Threats within the cloud are severe turbulence, very strong updrafts (some as high as 100 m/s or more) and downdrafts containing torrential rain, hail and lightning.</p>

<p>To better illustrate the magnitude of vertical winds, here is a quick plot from a modeled storm I am working with.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRKvJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this plot the reds are updraft and blues are downdraft with the scale on the right in meters/second.  The plot covers 20 km x 20 km area at a height of 5.4 km, which is close to 18,000 ft or 500 mb.  This corresponds to the main updraft in a supercell and you can find areas where less than 5 km cover a vertical wind gradient of 50 m/s.  If you were penetrating this at any decent airspeed you would be in for a very rough ride.
 This storm only had 1800 J/kg CAPE and updrafts can be much faster than this. </p>

<hr>

<p>CB clouds are (typically) realized from a release of convective available potential energy (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_available_potential_energy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CAPE</a>), which is simply a measure of how much warmer a parcel rising from the surface is than its surroundings as it rises.  In an environment that is favorable for convection (CAPE, vertical windshear) where there is ample moisture and a mechanism to force parcels to rise to their level of free convection you can end up with a CB cloud.  A CB is simply a cumulus cloud with rain falling out of it and whether this is a small rainshower or a severe rotating supercell is determined by the environment the storm occurs in.  </p>

"What is the difference between a POH and an AFM?","21062","","<p>Some aircraft come with a Pilot Operating Handbook and some come with an Aircraft Flight Manual.  Why the different name, and is there a difference between them?</p>

<p>The difference between the two is mainly in length and content: an AFM is usually a thinner document, satisfying the requirements of <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.10#14:1.0.1.3.10.7.106"" rel=""nofollow"">FAR 23.1581</a> and not much else, while a POH contains these required items plus other information like system diagrams (The contents &amp; format of a POH are standardized in <a href=""http://gama.aero/files/gama_specification_1_october_1996_pdf_498ca05388.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">GAMA's Specification 1</a>).</p>

<p><em>Parts</em> of the POH (like the Limitations section) are FAA-Approved, and serve as the AFM, and both documents are typically associated with a specific airframe (by serial number).</p>

<p><strong>A better explanation might be this:</strong><br>
The <code>AFM</code> is a regulatory document (it's contents are prescribed under the section of the regulations the aircraft was certificated under - Part 23, Part 25, etc). The <code>POH</code> is a GAMA-defined document whose contents meet the regulatory requirements of an AFM, and present other information in a standardized way so that a pilot can go from a Cessna to a Piper to a Mooney to a Socata and browse the book to learn about the airplane they're about to fly with all the information presented the same way no matter who the manufacturer is.</p>

<hr>

<p>The other two types of documents you may encounter are an ""Owner's Manual"" (which usually goes along with a thinner AFM &amp; provides some of the information found in the newer-style POH) and a Pilot Information Manual (PIM) which is a ""generic"" version of the POH which many pilots buy so they can study the procedures without removing the regulatory document from the aircraft.</p>

"How much, generally speaking, does it cost to learn how to fly?","21039","","<p>One of my life goals is to learn how to fly a plane. I can't do it now due to time constraints, but I am curious: How much, in general terms, does it cost to learn how to fly? I.e. piloting lessons, license fees, etc. I would be doing it in the US.</p>
","<p>Assuming a regular private pilot's license (i.e. not sport/recreation), a part 61 instructor, and a rented aircraft, then you need to budget for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aircraft rental (this usually includes oil and fuel)</li>
<li>Instructor time (air and ground)</li>
<li>Materials (books, DVDs, charts, fuel tester etc.) as recommended by your instructor</li>
<li>Headset</li>
<li>Third-class medical</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Written test fee</li>
<li>Examiner's fee for the actual test</li>
</ul>

<p>If we assume the aircraft costs \$120/hr wet (i.e. including oil and fuel), an instructor costs \$40/hr and you need 50 hours to be ready for the test (40 is the minimum required) then you can do a calculation like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>35 flying hours with instructor: \$5600</li>
<li>15 flying hours solo: \$1800</li>
<li>15 hours ground school (instructor's time): \$600</li>
<li>Materials: \$500</li>
<li>Headset: \$500</li>
<li>Third-class medical: \$150</li>
<li>Renter's insurance: \$700 (per year)</li>
<li>Written test fee: \$150</li>
<li>DPE test fee: \$400 (plus \$120 rental for the aircraft)</li>
<li><strong>Total: \$10,520</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can play around with these numbers, there's a lot of variation and research is obviously important. But the single largest cost will be the number of flying hours you need, so anything you can do to reduce that time is worthwhile and the simplest - but unfortunately not the easiest - way to do it is to fly as much as possible, i.e. several times a week. Given weather and other factors, you should probably even plan to fly more than you actually can on paper: a bunch of flights will certainly be cancelled.</p>

<p>You can also train in the most 'minimal' aircraft you can find: a two-seater aircraft without a glass panel could be \$50/hr cheaper than a four-seater with a G1000. Unless you have a very clear idea about what sort of flying you'll do in the longer term there's no point in paying for anything that isn't directly required for the private pilot's test.</p>

"How do airlines pay for their planes?","21021","","<p>Taking <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"">easyJet</a> as an example, they have <a href=""http://corporate.easyjet.com/~/media/Files/E/Easyjet-Plc-V2/pdf/content/press-info-kit.pdf"">a fleet</a> of over 200 A319's and A320's. At a price tag of around \$90m per plane, that equates to about \$18bn.</p>

<p>Given that their turnover for 2012/13 was around \$7bn, and their net profit was only \$660m, how exactly do they own so many planes? Are they financed long-term? Are they leased?</p>

<p>How are the deals structured for the big airlines when purchasing new planes?</p>
","<p>The overwhelming majority of major airlines do lease at least some of their aircraft. And most airlines who choose to buy do not end up paying that full price tag.</p>

<p>In the case of Easyjet, around half their fleet is leased (as of 2013). Leasing allows airlines with weak balance sheets or with poor future prospects to increase capacity without locking capital.</p>

<p>In fact, the largest aircraft owners are aircraft leasing companies. For example, GECAS (General Electric Capital Aviation Services), the largest aircraft lessor, currently owns around 1,700 aircraft, being operated by 230 airlines around the world.</p>

<p>There are other (not state-owned and generally low cost) airlines, such as Ryanair, who are fond of owing most of their aircraft. What Ryanair does is negotiate very good procurement deals with Boeing (by buying large packs of planes, all being B-737s), use them for around 5 years, and then sell them before their price has gone down too low. This takes a burden on their debt levels, but seems to work for them so far on the long run.</p>

<p>This aircraft resell value is an important aspect to consider when comparing leasing vs purchasing, as well as tax incentives derived from amortization.</p>

<p>Legacy carriers (many of them state owned), on the other hand, have a tendency to purchase most of their fleet, and keeping them around for the full lifespan of the machine (around 30 years).</p>

<p>The actual price a company pays for a given aircraft is not public (understandably) and most figures you would be able to find are related to ""list prices"". However, in 2005 Ryanair was forced to disclose facts about one of the massive (by the time) purchases of Boeing aircraft. Apparently, they paid <a href=""http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002250601_ryanair23.html"">less than half of the public list price</a>.</p>

"Why do airplanes not have manual transmission?","20668","","<p>I have limited experience with flight simulators but I have never bumped into a plane with manual transmission while, on the contrary, it's very common for other means of transportation (like cars and bikes) that rely on engine with some form of transmission control. </p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to know if it's actually true that no airplane have (or had) manual transmission and, secondly, why that is so. </p>
","<p>Aircraft have <strong>fixed</strong> gears (when they have gears at all)! However in a sense a variable-pitch propeller can be considered analogous to transmission in a car and it was manual in some aircraft.</p>

<p>The power transmitted by propeller is, within some reasonable range, proportional to its rotation rate. And so is, again within some reasonable range, the power produced by the engine. So for slow planes a fixed pitch propeller with connected by fixed gear does a decent job. As you open the throttle, the engine speed increases, so does the propeller and that's exactly what it needs to do to transmit the power. Simpler aircraft have no gears at all and propeller is mounted directly on the engine shaft, higher power engines often have 2:1 reduction gear as the engine rpm would be too high for a propeller.</p>

<p>Now at higher speed, the apparent propeller pitch is reduced as the air is already moving, so it would spin faster and faster and eventually too fast for the engine. To counter this, faster propeller-driven aircraft have variable pitch propeller. As speed increases, it is set to higher angle of attack (coarser) so it keeps delivering power without increasing rpm.</p>

<p>Early variable pitch propellers had manually controlled pitch, but quite quickly constant speed propellers were developed (many WWII aircraft had them already) where a weight-on-spring controls the propeller pitch so that constant rpm is maintained. The manually controlled units required a lot of attention and the constant-speed system is rather simple, so manual pitch control was quickly abandoned.</p>

<p>And that is kind of equivalent to perfect variable gear transmission. The pilot still has a throttle lever and a propeller pitch lever and selects power and rpm independently. Higher rpm allow higher power, but don't require it, so landing is usually done with low power, but max rpm so the engine reacts quickly if power is added (does not need to spin up). During cruise some more moderate value is selected (according to manufacturer recommendation) to reduce wear of the engine. </p>

<p>Turboprop engines always have constant-speed propellers, because in a turbine engine the difference between turbine speed at idle and at full power is not actually that big. Again the rpm limits maximum power, so landing is done with low power, but high rpm and the engine reacts quickly when power is added.</p>

<p>Last the turbojet/turbofan engines just turn the turbines and compressors as they need. It's not much different from the fixed propeller really, though the jet engines now usually have variable guide vanes in the stator (that are just linked to rpm).</p>

"Is a firm landing an indication of the pilot inexperience?","20628","","<p>In a commercial airplane, when a landing has been a bit firm, a passenger may think it was not perfect, or maybe performed by an inexperienced pilot.</p>

<sup>(<a href=""http://vinemoments.com/tnt-boeing-747-400-hard-landing-dusseldorf/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</sup></p>

<p>A perfect landing is seen by passengers as one where the contact with the runway is almost imperceptible. Is that true? are there other technical or regulatory explanations?</p>
","<p>First of all, the landing should be in the touchdown zone. Often I see pilots try to achieve a very smooth landing but floating far out of the touchdown zone before touching terra firma. Then they have to brake hard and taxi of at the far end. There are no points for landing outside the touchdown zone, even if it is the smoothest landing imaginable. In many overruns, landing late is a contributing factor.</p>

<p>A good landing is in the touchdown zone, firm enough to quickly spin up the wheels (and prevent wear by smearing rubber over hundreds of feet), and not so hard that it bounces up again. In calm winds, that can be very smooth, cross wind and wet / contaminated runways require a bit more of firm landing. </p>

<p>Hard landings<sup>1</sup> can occur due to turbulence (wind shifts), upslope of the runway or when the air density above the runway is lower due to heating (typically in calm winds, with sun heating the runway surface)  </p>

<p>So a hard landing is not necessarily an indication of pilot inexperience. However, some of the hardest landing I have ever experienced were when I joined in a training flight where new airline pilots were practicing landings in a Boeing 737 for the first time after their simulator training. I wouldn't be surprised if the runway was dented :-)</p>

"What is an afterburner and how long can a jet fly on afterburner?","20547","","<p>I heard this word so many time in military documentary about jets, especially fighter jets, but I don't fully understand what it is or how it works. In a documentary from the Discovery Channel, all but one fighter needed to engage afterburner to reach supersonic speed. Could you tell me why is that?</p>

<p>The documentary also states that a fighter jet rarely engages this system. If the afterburner system can make a jet fly faster, why don't they use it all the time? Is that because of the airframe cannot handle supersonic airflow for a long period of time?</p>
","<p>An afterburner is a secondary combustion system which burns additional fuel downstream of the combustion chamber, to further increase thrust at the expense of much higher fuel consumption.</p>

<p>This is the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 afterburning turbofan, variants of which power the USAF's 4th-generation fleet of F-15s and F-16s:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wn32d.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wn32d.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The final spoke-looking thing just beyond the turbine fins, plus all the space between the turbine core and the exhaust nozzle, is the afterburner. In this area, fuel is sprayed directly into the exhaust stream from the turbine core, where the heat from the air leaving the core is enough to ignite it. This additional pressure adds to the thrust produced by the turbine.</p>

<p>As I said, though, the tradeoff is increased fuel consumption, <strike>sometimes</strike> usually dramatically so. The F-16 at full military power and low altitudes burns about 8000 pounds of fuel an hour, which with a full droptank configuration gives it about 2 hours' flight time. Cruising at higher altitudes, that flight time can be further extended as both the higher altitude and the lower throttle setting (about 80%) reduce fuel flow rate by up to 40% versus low-altitude flight.</p>

<p>In full afterburner at low altitudes, the F-16 can burn in excess of 64,000 pounds an hour. At full throttle, a U.S.-variant F-16 with maximum external fuel stores has about 20 minutes until it's on emergency reserves (which would only last an extra minute or so at full afterburner). The speed gain is minimal; the F-16 cruises at between 450-550 knots, while full afterburner only increases that to about 700-800 knots with a typical underwing loadout. So, burning 8 times the fuel, you get around a 50% speed boost.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT: Can any other aircraft perform this?</em></strong></p>
","<p>The F-111 has, like many aircraft, a fuel dump port so it can get rid of a lot of heavy fuel rather quickly. Most aircraft have the dump ports on the wings, the F-111 designers put it in the tail between the engines. End result is if you dump fuel and briefly light the afterburner you will ignite the liquid fuel in your wake creating a rather spectacular trail of fire.</p>

<p>Aerodynamically it's completely useless, financially it's very expensive, you'd only do it in combat if you were suicidal as it greatly increases your IR signature right where you don't want it, but at an airshow it does look totally badass, especially as the afterburner is adding a lot of noise at the same time.</p>

<p>I would expect any pilot who does a dump-and-burn outside of an airshow (or an emergency) will have his own tail set on fire by the air wing's commanding officer.</p>

<p>The SR-71 had a similar issue - it leaked like a sieve on the ground. Rotating for takeoff would occasionally set fire to the JP-7 on the runway leaving a burning trail behind it much like the Road Runner.</p>

<p><strong>Reply to the video:</strong>
watch the takeoff section carefully. You can clearly see the afterburners come on before the fuel dump starts.</p>

<p><strong>Reply to about half the comments:</strong>
Highly unlikely they designed it to do this. The F-111 was one of the earlier swing-wing planes, that meant that you can't put much on the wings. And as the bigger tank is in the fuselage anyway, someone would have looked at the space between the engines and thought it was just right for a dump pipe. The flame effect was probably discovered later.</p>

Older runways may still use an outdated scheme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Runway threshold markings come in two configurations. They either consist of eight longitudinal stripes of uniform dimensions disposed symmetrically about the runway centerline, as shown in FIG 2-3-1, or the number of stripes is related to the runway width as indicated in TBL 2-3-2. A threshold marking helps identify the beginning of the runway that is available for landing. In some instances the landing threshold may be relocated or displaced. </p>

<p>With regard to how to tell the difference between Configuration A and B, Advisory <a href=""http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/8852E94E6586FDD28625700300509565?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=standards%20for%20airport%20markings"" rel=""noreferrer"">AC 150/5340-1J</a> goes into significantly more detail. It states that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The threshold markings may have either of the characteristics in (1) or (2) below, but after January 1, 2008, only those characteristics in (2) will be acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The details:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Configuration A.</strong> The runway threshold marking consists of eight longitudinal stripes of uniform dimensions spaced symmetrically about the runway centerline as shown in Figure 1. The stripes are 150 feet (45 m) long and 12 feet (3.6 m) wide and spaced 3 feet (1 m) apart, except for the center space, which is 16 feet (4.8 m). For runways less than 150 feet (45 m) in width, the length of the markings is not changed, but the width of the markings, spaces between markings and distance of markings from the runway edge are changed proportionally. For runways greater than 150 feet (45m) in width, the width of the markings and spaces between the markings may be increased proportionally or additional stripes may be added to both sides.</p>
  
  <p>The rule for Configuration A markings requires scaling the width of the stripes and their spacings (and the outboard spacings from the runway edges) proportionally, keeping the length fixed. For a runway 150 feet wide the Configuration A stripes are 12 ft wide with 3 ft spacings (and an 8 ft spacing from the inboard stripe to the centreline, leaving 10 ft between the outboard and runway edge). The Configuration B stripes are given a fixed width of 5.75 ft with spacings of 5.75 ft also. If a Configuration A scheme were used on a narrow runway such that the stripes were equal to the width of the Configuration B stripes, the runway width would need to be about 72 feet (12 ft stripe width for a 150 ft runway width scaled to 5.75 ft for 71.875 ft). For a 72 ft wide runway bearing the Configuration A scheme the spacing between stripes would be reduced to slightly less than 1.5 ft. The difference between the schemes therefore ought to be apparent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Configuration B.</strong> For this configuration, the number of stripes required is related to the runway width as indicated in Table 2. The stripes are 150 feet (45 m) long and 5.75 feet (1.75 m) wide and spaced 5.75 feet (1.75 m) apart except the center space is 11.5 feet (3.5 m) as shown in Figure 1. The outboard edges of the outboard stripes extend laterally to within 10 feet (3 m) of the edge of a runway or to a distance of 92 feet (27 m) on either side of a runway centerline, whichever results in the smaller lateral distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is further borne out by a <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/certalerts/media/cert0404.rtf"" rel=""noreferrer"">May 2004 advisory (CERTALERT 04-04)</a> which states:</p>

"How can a helicopter be designed without a tail rotor?","20166","","<p>How will the main rotor torque be balanced if a helicopter doesn't have a tail rotor? </p>
","<p>The torque in a helicopter is generated by the engine driving the main rotor in one direction, which causes the fuselage to spin in the other direction. The tail rotor shaft is horizontally mounted and hence creates it own 'lift' to provide anti-torque. The pitch of the tail rotor gives directional control.</p>

<p>Common ways to design a helicopter without a tail rotor:</p>

<p><strong>Tandem rotors</strong> : Two main rotors mounted one in front of the other. The rotor discs spin in opposite directions. All power from the engines is used for lift. Example: <strong>CH-47</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wWQGO.jpg"" alt=""CH-47""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Transverse rotors</strong> : Two main rotors mounted side-by-side. Example: <strong>Kamov Ka-22</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Kamov-Ka-22.jpg"" alt=""Ka-22""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Co-axial rotors</strong> : Two rotor discs are mounted one on top of the other. The engine units power both rotors. This structure requires a very complex swashplate mechanism. Example: <strong>Kamov Ka-25</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a0WFb.jpg"" alt=""Ka-25""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Intermeshing rotors</strong> :  In this main rotor assembly, the two set rotor masts are installed at a slight angle to each other, in a transversely symmetric manner, so that the rotor blades intermesh without colliding with each other. Example: <strong>Kaman K-MAX</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mywa7.jpg"" alt=""Kaman K-MAX""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Tip jet</strong> : This is an interesting solution to the no-tail-rotor problem. Instead of driving the rotors with a turboshaft engine, compressed air is sent through nozzles installed at the tips of rotor blades. The engines effectively push against the air rather than the helicopter fuselage. The rotor spins just like a Catherine wheel. Example: <strong>Hiller Hornet</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mmi2I.jpg"" alt=""Hiller Hornet""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>NOTAR</strong> : NOTAR - NO TAil Rotor uses a fan inside the boom to build a high volume of low-pressure air, which exits through two slots and creates a boundary layer flow of air along the tailboom utilizing the Coandă effect. The boundary layer changes the direction of airflow around the tailboom, creating thrust opposite the motion imparted to the fuselage by the torque effect of the main rotor. Example: <strong>MD-900</strong></p>

"Do lights on aircraft flash in a specific pattern?","20067","","<p>On a clear night, everyone can spot planes quite easily: they have flashing lights. I have noticed that the pattern seems different for different planes, and tried to find a meaning. </p>

<p>What I saw so far is that they seem to have three lights that flash, two at the wings, one at the tail. Those at the wings flash two times (approximately per second, in quick succession), and that one at the tail flashes only once, along with the first flash of the wing.</p>

<p>Now that explains two patterns I seem to see from further away: Two flashes and one flash. It is probably that I am just not seeing the wings flashing for those where I only see one.</p>

<p>So far so good, but then again sometimes I see planes with more flashing, and those are faster. I had difficulties to count them, but it's at least three, maybe four quick flashes. </p>

<p><em>Do these different patterns have any meaning?</em> I tried to match up the planes with the flight radar information, but since it is quite crowded around here, I wasn't really able to identify them. But whenever I saw that quick flashing ones, there was a military plane around, is that just coincidence?</p>
","<p>Civilian aircraft have flashing lights based on manufacturer design preference.  As others have stated, aircraft like Boeing and Airbus have different patterns.</p>

<p>However, military aircraft can often select the pattern they want to use.  This helps military pilots identify key tactical aircraft during night operations, such as the tanker flying around the carrier.  It is definitely not coincidental that you noticed military aircraft with a unique pattern, although I'm truly shocked at your attention to detail.</p>

  <p>In the early 1920's the force from a rotating cylinder was used to power a sailing ship. The idea, proposed by Anton Flettner of Germany, was to replace the mast and cloth sails with a large cylinder rotated by an engine below deck. The idea worked, but the propulsion force generated was less than the motor would have generated if it had been connected to a standard marine propeller! </p>

<li><p>If the cylinder rotation accidentally becomes slow or stops, its lift disappears completely. This plane will never be able to glide. </p></li>
<li><p>If a gust blows from backside during a slow flight (takeoff or landing), the cylinder wings generate a down force. </p></li>

"Why don't pilots always use autoland?","19953","","<p>In aeroplanes that are equipped for autoland and landing at an airport with a working and adequate instrument landing system for the conditions, why would a pilot choose not to use autoland?</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say it's due to some of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Autoland is stressful and labour-intensive for pilots compared with flying the plane normally down to the ground in VMC.</li>
<li>Autoland produces less comfortable or otherwise ""worse"" quality landings.</li>
<li>Using autoland is less fun or enjoyable for the pilots.</li>
<li>The use of autoland is restricted by aviation regulations.</li>
</ol>

<p>But I don't have any sources to back up these claims.</p>


","<p>There are a number of reasons why pilot don't use autoland all the time, even if the airport and aircraft are equipped with the right equipment.</p>

<p>To name the two most important ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pilots need to practise their flying technique. If they would always
fly autopilot, they would lose the skills to fly. Skills that they
need when the autopilot does fail. There are phases of flight where
it is better or even required to let the autopilot do its job, but
landing is one the things pilot are allowed to and need to be capable
of doing themselves. Of course autoland needs to be practised as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto land requires very accurate ILS guidance. Even if the airport is
equipped with calibrated ILS Cat IIIb equipment (required for
autoland), the signals will be degraded by traffic that is operating
near the ILS antennas. Under low visibility circumstances, when
pilots cannot land visually, traffic spacing is increased and ground
vehicles are not allowed anywhere near the ILS antennas to ensure the
best possible signal quality. This is a standard part of the Low
Visibility Procedures (LVP) of all airports. The downside of this is
that the capacity of the airport is reduced. If autoland would be
performed while there is no ILS signal protection, the effects can be

So electronic devices that uses 12, 5 or 3V may contain their own voltage converter (though this is less and less true with modern efficient switch-mode converters). If DC conversion was as much efficient as AC conversion, we wouldn't see high-voltage lines. Last but not least, it's easier to switch, because the current is null twice per cycle. DC must be switched at full current, which is expensive and weight costly. (thanks mins)</p>

","<p>The primary reason is probably that it ensures there is no confusion between passengers, crew, or infants. Technically, ""passengers"" is the number of seats occupied, ""crew"" is both the pilots and flight attendants on duty.

"How can I tell the difference between Spitfires and Hurricanes in photos?","19593","","<p>The Spitfire was one of WW2's iconic aircraft, its fame coming from its spectacular performance in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain#Fighters"">Battle of Britain</a>. But in that battle, Hawker Hurricanes outnumbered Spitfires 2:1. </p>

<p>Often articles about Spitfires use images of Hurricanes. How can I tell the difference between a Spitfire and Hurricane visually?</p>
","<p>There are quite a lot of differences, some more subtle than others, but I tend to find this is the best angle for identification: the side view. Although as we'll see later in this answer, the top/bottom view has a fairly obvious difference, and there's a clue that we can use to identify from the front or rear</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0FzKw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0FzKw.jpg"" alt=""Hurricane and Spitfire""></a></p>

<p>So what are you looking at?</p>

<p>On the left is the Hurricane. It's <strong>slightly larger than the Spitfire</strong>, although that's not always a great help from distance. Perhaps more usefully, the fuselage is fundamentally different shape:  I'll elaborate on this in several areas where we can directly compare.</p>

<p>Firstly, the <strong>rear fuselage</strong>. At first glance the two are very similar, but the Hurricane has a much more pronounced ""drop"" to the tail, while the Spitfire's is a ""rise"".</p>

<p>What do I mean by that? Follow the line of the top of the cockpit canopy: the Hurricane's fuselage behind the canopy drops away, while the bottom of the fuselage is relatively flat. On the Spitfire, it's reversed - the top of the fuselage follows the line of the canopy, while the bottom comes up to meet it. It's a subtle difference at first glance, but once you've seen it once it's a very clear distinction. When looking at the Hurricane's rear fuselage, it almost appears to have a ""dog leg"", where the rearmost area drops in relation to the middle of the aircraft. The Spitfire's follows a much more continuous line</p>

<p>The Spitfire is also clearly much more sleek - it's a ""pencil"" shaped fuselage, long and thin and curvy. The Hurricane is more blunt and ""solid"".</p>

<p><strong>Other differences?</strong> Look at the tail. The Spitfire's is relatively small and curves upward from the top of the fuselage in a smooth curve, while the Hurricane's comes off at a sharper angle. Similarly the Hurricane's horizontal stabilizer is higher - almost in line with the top of the fuselage.</p>

<p>The Engine cowling shape, as with the cockpit, is different: where again the Spitfire's continues a nearly straight line from the bottom of the cockpit, the Hurricane's has a distinct curve.</p>

<p>If you can get closer, you will also note that the Hurricane's fuselage is almost ""ridged"" - it's a metal frame with a fabric covering, and that gives it a bumpy appearance, vaguely visible on the above photo.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9xQb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9xQb.jpg"" alt=""Spitfire Hurricane front""></a></p>

<p><strong>What about if you can't get a side view, though</strong>? Here's the Spitfire (below) and Hurricane (above) from the front... but you can see the same from the rear</p>

<p><strong>Well from the front</strong>, there's a single very nice clue under the fuselage: the radiator housing: that box-like structure hanging from the bottom of the plane. The Hurricane has one, and it's on the centre of the fuselage. The Spitfire's is not, it's under the right wing. On some later models, there are two, one under each wing.</p>

<p>The next photo is included mostly for the wing shape, but the aforementioned radiator boxes are visible too: from this, we can tell the Spitfire is a relatively late war model: a Mk IX (9) onward: although there are other subtle clues that suggest this is a much later model... the 5 bladed propeller indicates a Griffon engine, so a Mk XIV (14) or later. Anyway, we can see the Hurricane's single centre radiator, and the Spitfire with one under each wing</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDtZd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDtZd.jpg"" alt=""Spitfire Hurricane underside""></a></p>

<p>And finally, <strong>how about the bottom</strong>? Well, the Spitfire's wing is extremely distinctive: it has an ""Elliptical"" wing, shared with only one or two other aircraft. Once you can recognise the Elliptical wing, you can recognise the Spitfire very easily in flight. The Spitfire's wing, particularly the trailing edge, is very curved compared to most other contemporary aircraft. The Hurricane's wings are much more conventionally shaped, with both leading and trailing edges being straight (a trait shared with aircraft like the Typhoon/Tempest, P-51, Me109, A6M ""Zero"" and most other aircraft from the WW2 era)</p>

<p><strong>Late War Spitfires</strong> (the above is a Mk 22) are even more distinctive: they have a ""bubble"" canopy that protrudes entirely from the fuselage.</p>

"Why did this plane fly in a zigzag pattern?","19567","","<p>I was tracking flight NKS739 from LAX to SEA this morning and saw that it made some some odd turns. If you look at the track from FlightRadar24.com you can see that it was heading toward SEA then it took a large turn to the right then to the left then returned to its original course.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kqtc2.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kqtc2.jpg"" alt=""FlightRadar24 screenshot showing Spirit Airlines flight NK739 flying in a zizgag some 400 km before its destination of Seattle and then flying in a mostly straight line again afterwards.""></a></p>

<p>This does not look like the usual technical glitch from Flightradar24, and FlightAware shows the same track. There was no weather anywhere in the area. There were many aircraft in the area at the time and none of them made any unusual turns. There are no MOA's in the area (most of it is over a national forest) and none of the other aircraft seem to be avoiding anything in the area. I tried to see if LiveATC.net had a recording but that's Seattle center's area and they don't appear to have a feed for ZSE.</p>

<p>I can't come up with any reason for such an odd deviation. The aircraft arrived in SEA and there didn't seem to be any problem. It immediately turned around and made another flight which was uneventful. </p>

<p>Is there anything that might explain this deviation? Is it just a glitch?</p>
","<p>Alrighty then, that took some detective work.</p>

<p>Here's another flight around the same time, SkyWest 4458, which arrived 2 minutes later. Notice it's one deviation, compared to two deviations in your example.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7R4zE.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7R4zE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Weather seemed fine, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport"">KSEA</a> has TBFM (Time Based Flow Management) since Aug 2013. If the ATC asks a plane to delay its arrival time, the way it's done is to deviate from the route, then get back on it again—that's if slowing down alone won't meet the time target.</p>

<p>Pilots then use the RTA (Required Time of Arrival) function of the FMC. Initially the function was rarely used, but now with <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/"">NextGen</a> in the U.S., SESAR in Europe, and similar systems elsewhere, it is frequently used.</p>

<p>It can be arranged way ahead of the airport, i.e., it can be ordered by the approach controller, yet the center controller of another ARTCC delivers the message.</p>

<p>It looks exactly like that. Deviate, if not enough, deviate the other way.</p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p>The system is called ERAM (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8IvvgWPjCo"">En-Route Automation Modernization</a>).</p>

<p>ERAM detects future conflicts, and based on that, traffic is asked to speed up, slow down, or deviate to slow down further. It reduces/eliminates hold time.</p>

<p>Europe—the first to use it in 2012—refers to it as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJxX-a8rcc"">initial 4D trajectory management</a>. Planes arrive at waypoints at agreed times.</p>

<p>For whatever reason—most probably sudden traffic influx—they were asked to slow down.</p>

<hr>

<p>The difference between this, and the regular vectoring/doglegging in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control#Approach_and_terminal_control"">terminal area</a>, is the way it is predicted, coordinated, and then relayed to airplanes <strong>far from the airport.</strong></p>

<p>Below you can see as the jet turned, it slowed down as well. The initial upward spike is just the tailwind when the plane turned.</p>

"Does the B787 (Dreamliner) operate with higher cabin pressure?","19441","","<p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuselage is almost completely made of composite carbon fibre material, which is not susceptible to metal fatigue.</p>

<p>The main reason why the cabin pressure in a pressurized aircraft is kept as low as possible is to reduce the expansion and shrinking of the fuselage due to changes in pressure differences, reducing metal fatigue in the long run. </p>

<p>Does the 787 use higher cabin pressures than other commercial aircraft? Boeing <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2006-10-30-boeing-air-usat_x.htm"">touted this as one of the revolutionary new features of the aircraft</a> back in 2006, but does it actually use higher cabin pressure now that the plane is in use by airlines?</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/paris2013/pdf/BCA/bck-787%20interior.pdf"">this document by Boeing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Altitude: How High Is Just Right?</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Today's airplanes are pressurized to a typical cabin altitude of 6,500
  to 7,000 feet (1,981 – 2,133 m), with a maximum certification altitude
  of 8,000 feet (2,438 m). Because the advanced composite materials that
  make up the 787’s fuselage do not fatigue, the 787 can be pressurized
  more, which allows for lower cabin altitude levels. </p>
  
  <p>Studies at Oklahoma State University explored the effect of altitude
  on passengers to determine optimum levels. After testing at various
  altitudes, it became clear that lowering the cabin altitude to 6,000
  feet (1,830 m) provided meaningful improvements. Lowering the cabin
  altitude further, however, provided almost no additional benefit.
  Based on that knowledge, Boeing designed the 787 to be pressurized to
  a maximum cabin altitude of 6,000 feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if we assume a constant altitude of 43,000 (the 787's service ceiling<sup>1</sup>), we would get a maximum differential of:</p>

<ul>
<li>6,000 ft Cabin Altitude = 9.06 psi</li>
<li>8,000 ft Cabin Altitude = 8.11 psi</li>
</ul>

<p>This would indeed be a higher cabin pressure than what Boeing considers ""typical"" at maximum altitudes.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> It is probably actually an even bigger difference since the ceiling of a lot of airplanes isn't this high so the max differential would be even lower.</p>

<p>They are not defined in an IATA glossary I looked at but I did find this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Definition of Flight Segment</h2>
  
  <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the international trade body for airlines around the world, defines a flight segment as the operation of a flight with a single flight designator between the point where passengers first board an aircraft and the passengers' final destination. A flight designator includes an airline code, which has two letters or a number and a letter in combination, and a flight number of up to four digits. A flight segment can include any number of stops where passengers board and deplane the same aircraft operated by a single airline.</p>
  
  <h2>Comparison of Flights and Legs</h2>
  
  <p>A flight is defined by the IATA as the operation of one or more flight legs with the same flight designator. Unlike a flight segment, a flight may involve one or more aircraft. The IATA defines a leg as the operation of an aircraft from one scheduled departure station to its next scheduled arrival station. A flight segment can include one or more legs operated by a single aircraft with the same flight designator.</p>

"What is a ""Flight Director""?","18858","","<p>What is a <strong>Flight Director</strong>, and how does it differ from <strong>Autopilot</strong>?</p>
","<p>The flight director is related to the autopilot system. It displays a guide on the artificial horizon, which shows the attitude of the airplane, but does nothing to control the plane. The guide represents a reference of an airplane attitude that will follow the parameters set for the autopilot. The pilot can manually fly the plane directly where the flight director indicates, and by doing so the plane will follow the parameters set for the autopilot.</p>

<p>If the autopilot is engaged, autopilot flies the plane to follow the flight director. The flight director serves as a visual indication of where the autopilot wants the plane to go. Although a flight director typically accompanies an autopilot system, some aircraft have a flight director without an autopilot.</p>

<p>The procedure to engage them is to first turn on the flight director, which will show where the autopilot wants the plane to be, and then to engage the autopilot, which will then automatically fly the plane.</p>

<p>This is what the autopilot controls can look like.</p>

"Why do we still use pilots to fly airplanes?","18805","","<p>With the recent advances in drone and remote control technology, why are there still commercial and military pilots?</p>

<p>I understand that there can be some serious tactical advantages to human pilots in military operations, but for patrol and commercial flights what are the advantages of a human pilot in the aircraft as opposed to a drone or a remotely controlled airplane?</p>
","<p>That's a good question, and brings up a joke that many pilots know well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""What's going to be in the cockpit of the future?""</p>
  
  <p>""A dog and a pilot.""</p>
  
  <p>""A dog?  Why a dog?""</p>
  
  <p>""Well, the dog is there to keep the pilot from touching anything.""</p>
  
  <p>""Ummm, why have the pilot then?""</p>
  
  <p>""Well, someone has to feed the dog! ""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technology has improved to the point where airplanes can pretty much fly and even land themselves.  They are even getting pretty good at handling ""normal"" emergencies like engine failures and depressurizations.</p>

<p>Where pilots really shine though are the type of abnormal and emergency situations that aren't ""in the book"".  </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232"">When an engine flies apart and shreds the hydraulic lines on all three redundant hydraulic systems</a>, a computer will be out of options because it was never programmed to handle that (because it was considered ""virtually impossible"" when it was designed).  A pilot on the other hand can analyze and experiment until he finds enough of a solution to keep the airplane in the air as he works through other issues.</p>

<p>During a total electrical failure, the computers won't be much good.  Sure, you can design redundant systems and make it so that it ""can never happen"", but what about <strong>when</strong> it does?</p>

<p>There are also all of the little things that a pilot is constantly making decisions on how to handle.  Some examples could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the airplane fly with a particular feature inoperative?  </li>
<li>What about multiple features inoperative?  </li>
<li>How do they interact with each other?  </li>
<li>What do you do when the passengers take too long to board and you are going to miss your departure slot?  </li>
<li>What do you do when the ground crew forgets to close a door?  </li>
<li>What about when the tug driver doesn't push you back <em>quite</em> far enough?  </li>
<li>Or ATC wants to change you to a different runway?  </li>
<li>Or you <strong>ask</strong> ATC to change you to a different runway because it might save a few minutes and that will keep you from having to deice again?  </li>
<li>Or another airplane unexpectedly pulls out in front of you while taxiing?  </li>
<li>A pilot can see ""ugly"" clouds off the end of the runway and decide that it would be better to wait a bit before taking off.  </li>
<li>What happens when a flock of birds suddenly appears during the takeoff roll?  </li>
<li>What happens when a passenger gets sick or unruly?  </li>
<li>When do you need to divert and when can you continue? </li>
</ul>

<p>On a typical flight, a pilot will make hundreds of small decisions that can make a big difference in the flight.  Any one of these (or one of the tens or hundreds of thousands of other things that could happen) could trip up a computer.</p>

<p>The pilot is also there as the ""final authority"".  If a hacker were to somehow hack into the automated systems, a pilot can always disconnect them and fly the airplane manually.  He can turn off systems, he can be...  Well, the pilot can be creative and a computer can only do what it was programmed to do.</p>

<p>Right now when a drone crashes it isn't such a big deal because <em>nobody was on board</em>.  If an airliner with a load full of paying passengers crashes it is a <strong>big</strong> deal.  Even just one.</p>

<p>Many of these problems can be overcome.  Some of them already have been.  Some of them may never be fully handled in an automatic way but maybe we could still do automated flights with an acceptable level of safety.  Some automation is actually <strong>better</strong> than some pilots in certain areas.</p>

<p>However, the biggest reason that we don't have fully automated passenger airplanes is because the general public feels comforted by a <strong><em>person</em></strong> being up front who can take over and carry them to safety if needed.  Even if the technology were 100% ready for automated passenger flights, I think that the number of people willing to purchase a ticket would be so low that it would be financially unfeasible for an airline to deploy it.</p>

"How do long-haul pilots cope with boredom?","18614","","<p>Imagine you're in a large jet on a long route on a major airway -- say, for example, you're in a 747 going LHR-JFK at night. It's dark, you're over the Atlantic, and ATC has cleared you to just keep on heading along at FL330 (or equivalent) for another ~1500 nautical miles.</p>

<p>As it has throughout much of the flight, the autopilot is effectively flying the plane. There's nothing on the weather radar, no adverse meteorological effects expected, and ATC ensures that aircraft are well separated. In short, other than occasionally changing radio frequencies, there is very little for you to do.</p>

<p>Just a week ago, you were in the simulator, practicing spin recovery, instrumentation inop procedures, engine failures epsilon before V<sub>1</sub>, and all sorts of other <em>fun</em> things that required your attention. In your spare time, you're a private pilot and enjoy flying VFR at lower altitudes with the occasional bit of aerobatics mixed in, and practicing what to do in all sorts of rare eventualities at odd attitudes. In other words, you like flying planes. Now, your job is to check that the sophisticated flight computers are still flying this plane, and that ATC have done their job properly. They are, and they have. For the next few hours, you're going to be doing nothing but sitting in a chair watching blackness roll past. You can't even talk to the guy next to you about the weather -- there isn't any!</p>

<p>How do long-haul pilots cope with boredom on long, uneventful segments? Is my above scenario completely not plausible (aside from the lack of weather) -- is there always <em>something meaningful to do</em> during a 7+ hour long flight? I would expect that pilot boredom or distraction would be a safety-critical situation, yet I cannot imagine a situation that involves two humans sitting in chairs in a small room for a long period of time where they will <em>not</em> be bored or distracted at some point. </p>

<p>Do airline transport pilots ever ""hope"" for ""something interesting"" to happen?</p>
","<p>From what I know, airline transport pilots do not get large chunks of free time on a typical long-haul flight which you described. They may get small intervals of free time (e.g. 10-20 minutes), but for sure, not hours. They do need to constantly monitor if the airplane is flying on the correct course, on the assigned altitude, remaining fuel amounts and several other tasks, <em>even when auto-pilot is engaged.</em></p>

<p><strong>So what do pilots do when they are not flying at all?</strong></p>

<p>Primarily, it depends on company policies. Delta <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/10/28/pilots.cockpit/index.html?eref=rss_us"">does not allow pilots</a> to do anything not related to flying the airplane:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You can't read a novel, but you could read a manual about procedures
  or about the airplane,"" ... ""You can't read a newspaper. You can't use
  a laptop. That's strictly prohibited.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But generally speaking, pilots engage in causal chats between themselves and flight attendants (when they visit the cockpit)<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>When there are more than two pilots, one is generally allowed to get some rest. They can also browse through magazines or read some books or flight-related material, but mostly stay alert and available. Some will study for an upcoming proficiency or rating. One of the two pilots can go to the bathroom too. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/30/travel/feat-delta-captain-lockout/"">Getting locked out depends on pure luck.</a></p>

<p>So in a nutshell, there are several different activities/tasks pilots will engage into, each different for a particular flight.</p>

<p>This is a funny little anecdote I recently read, which fits this discussion very well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Murphy's law grants you a heap of emergencies once you start feeling
  bored in the cockpit.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>: <em>As a ordinary passenger, I don't visit the cockpit, but I have noticed a few times what the flight attendants do. When they have free time, they have many things to talk about between themselves. Sometimes, they engage in small talk with passengers. They check their schedule and flights for the remainder of the day. Although the duties of flight attendants and pilots are entirely different, there are a bunch of activities which require their attention, and they can pass the time without getting too bored.</em></p>

"Why are airplanes riveted and not screwed?","18555","","<p>Replacing airframe panels and inspecting hard-to-reach parts would be easier with screws, I presume. So why are rivets used?</p>
","<p>Rivets need to press the two parts together AND to transmit shear. The pressure results in friction which is responsible for a considerable part of the load transmitted between two riveted panels. In order to hold up to the maximum possible amount of shear, the rivet needs a smooth surface. A thread would make it much more vulnerable due to the notch effect of the thread.</p>

<p>Since skin panels and flanges vary in thickness, a LOT of different screw sizes would need to be kept on stock so that every combination of panel thicknesses is covered with a fitting screw which has just the right amount of smooth shank length. Rivets, on the other hand, will be hammered to the right length during manufacture, so only a few sizes are needed to cover all those panel thicknesses.</p>

<p>Historically, metalworking tools were much less precise than today. For optimum shear transmission, the bolt must sit tightly in its hole. In the past, this could  not be done with screws, but only with rivets which grow thicker when set in place. And since aviation regulation authorities are VERY conservative, the easiest to certify joints are those proven rivet joints.</p>

<p>Also, repairability is not so bad with rivets, especially if you can reach only one side. The rivets get drilled out (with a slightly larger diameter drill) and after inspection the parts are riveted together again. And if you need the lowest mass for a given strength, again rivets win over screws. The difference might be small for the individual rivet, but it adds up for the whole airframe.</p>

"Is there a difference between MEA and MOCA within 22 nm of a VOR?","18484","","<p>As we all know from our instrument training, the MOCA is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas the MEA is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MINIMUM EN ROUTE IFR ALTITUDE (MEA)- The lowest published altitude between radio fixes which <strong>assures acceptable navigational signal coverage</strong> and <strong>meets obstacle clearance requirements</strong> between those fixes. The MEA prescribed for a Federal airway or segment thereof, area navigation low or high route, or other direct route applies to the entire width of the airway, segment, or route between the radio fixes defining the airway, segment, or route. </p>

<p>The only difference in language is the bit about 22 miles from a VOR.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you're within those 22 miles, there's no practical difference between a MEA and a MOCA, right?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aJe1W.png"" alt=""MEA/MOCA difference on V84 within 22 NM of PMM""></p>

<p><strong>If that's true, why is there an 1800 foot difference between the MEA and the MOCA within 22 miles of the PMM VOR on V84?</strong></p>
","<p>You are right. Within 22 nautical miles of the VOR, there is no practical difference between an MEA and a MOCA.</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that the 22 nmi is only a limitation if navigating via VOR's.</p>

<p><strong>14 CFR - CHAPTER I § 91.177  Minimum altitudes for IFR operations</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Operation of aircraft at minimum altitudes.
  Except when necessary for
  takeoff or landing, or unless otherwise
  authorized by the FAA, no person may
  operate an aircraft under IFR below—</p>
  
  <p>(1) The applicable minimum altitudes
  prescribed in parts 95 and 97 of this
  chapter. However, if both a MEA and a
  MOCA are prescribed for a particular
  route or route segment, a person may
  operate an aircraft below the MEA
  down to, but not below, the MOCA, provided
  the applicable navigation signals
  are available. <strong>For aircraft using VOR
  for navigation, this applies only when
  the aircraft is within 22 nautical miles
  of that VOR</strong> (based on the reasonable
  estimate by the pilot operating the aircraft
  of that distance)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The MOCA provides ""obstacle clearance requirements for the entire route segment,"" so if the applicable navigation signal is GPS, and you're receiving it, then you've met the requirements. This is why sometimes you see a MOCA on segments which aren't within 22 nmi of any VOR.</p>

<p>One other <em>practical</em> difference to keep in mind is that, especially in mountainous areas, you're much more likely to get radar coverage, and have better communcations clarity, at the MEA than the MOCA (I saw this a lot in Idaho). In those cases, ATC is probably going to prefer the MEA.</p>

","<p>Wind direction mostly, planes take off best when facing in the wind as that means free airspeed so the takeoff roll is shorter.</p>

<p>In busier airspace (with multiple towered airports) each airport coordinates the corridors so they don't intersect depending on available runways, prevailing winds and relative demands on the airports.</p>

"Could airline tires be deflated in mid-flight to reduce weight?","18396","","<p>As a means of weight reduction to reduce fuel consumption, could the tires on an aircraft’s landing gear be deflated once airborne then re-inflated just prior to landing?  Is that feasible and safe?</p>
","<p>It's a good question. Estimations of 120 kg weight savings of compressed air in the tyres have been made, that is not inconsiderable. A detailed estimation with dimensions from <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/faqs/aircrafttiredims.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a>. The B777-300 has tyres size 52 X 21 R 22:</p>

<ul>
<li>52 is outside diameter in inches = 1.32m</li>
<li>21 is tyre wide in inches = 0.53m</li>
<li>22 is rim diameter in inches = 0.56m</li>
<li>Side area of the tyre itself = $\frac {\pi}{4} (1.32^2 - 0.56^2) $ = 1.23 m$^2$. </li>
<li>Volume of the tyre = side area * width = 1.23 * 0.53 = 0.65 m$^3$. The B777 has 12 of these wheels so total tyre volume = 7.8 m$^3$. </li>
<li>Air at 1 bar pressure = 1.225 kg/m$^3$. Twelve wheels at 16 bar contain 7.8 * 1.225 * 16 = 153 kg of air.</li>
</ul>

<p>Weight savings in the order of magnitude of 150 kg, every trip for two to three decades, are nothing to sneeze at. Consider it the other way around: how sane would a person be if they would propose to put an extra 150 kg permanently on board because the extra fuel would be inconsequential?</p>

<p>To re-inflate the tyres, all infrastructure is on board already: jet engine final compressor stage pressure is definitely higher than the required 16 bar. From Rollys Royce The Jet Engine issue 5:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BF2j9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BF2j9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After cooling off from 700C - 1000K, to 30C = 300K, that is in the order of magnitude of the required air pressure for re-inflating the tyres. So technically, all is possible. The tyres can be re-inflated with existing infrastructure on board. Of course not with the existing unmodified infrastructure as it is now, it will need to be tweaked, but order of magnitude wise everything is on board already. Tweaking a tyre pressure inflator in the 21st century is a much simpler task than inventing the first autopilot in 1930. I mean come on guys.</p>

<p>Aluminium 1inch tubing weighs about a kilo a meter, and the engines are very close the wheels. 10 m extra tubing would be a lot. The hydraulic oil has a heat exchanger with the fuel in the wing, which is super cold just before landing, having spent all this time at -30C. Let's say that the total re-inflation installation weighs 30 kg tops.</p>

<p>Where the whole idea falls apart is in the safety aspects. We're approaching an airport with low fuel reserves and with flat tyres, too many things can go wrong and Murphy pops his head up from every corner. The undercarriage is a considerable weight and contributes virtually nothing to the flying and economic capabilities of the aircraft, but we better make sure that it pops out <em>every time</em> and can cushion the last stage of flight before all passengers can get safely off board.</p>

<p>In air passenger transport, if safety needs to compete with economics, safety wins every time.  </p>

<p>@mikerodent suggests in a deleted post that the tyres could be filled with helium. Not a bad suggestion actually: helium weighs 0.164 kg/m3, weight saving for the B777-300 is 132 kg and the tyre does not need to be re-inflated. The answer deserves to be undeleted and accepted.</p>

"How close is X-Plane experience to real flying?","18379","","<p>I started using X-Plane and am surprised at the easiness of flying (using a flight controller). Does this simulation software reflect how it is to fly (in any way) in reality?</p>

<p>From using the simulator, I understand that all I need to do is to switch the engines on, turn the brakes off and fly. Are there any additional things apart from a pre-flight checklist that an actual airline pilot has to do?</p>

<p>In addition, I understand that I haven't dove into the details of navigation in X-Plane as I am just wondering if the basics of the simulator software reflect real life conditions.</p>
","<p>X-Plane is a much truer simulation of flying than that flight game Microsoft used to make. In fact, when coupled with certified hardware and a CFI, X-Plane can power a sim that you can actually log FTD time in.</p>

<p>Since you ask about airline flying for your comparison, there is a lot more to that than just the flying. An airline pilot is, with few exceptions, always operating under instrument flight rules (IFR). This means flying in the clouds with no reference to anything but instruments, weather as bad as a few hundred feet visibility and strong crosswinds for landing and takeoff are all part of normal ops. You are also operating under ATC, so radio ops are normal. The only comparable computer simulation of ATC to reality is VATSIM (as mentioned in comments), though it doesn't approach the level of busyness that you'll find in some airspace and airports (with the exception of some of their organized fly-ins).</p>

<p>A transport category jet is also a bit more complicated than ""turn the engines on, release the brakes and go"". The only computer sims that capture the level of detail properly are ones like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBylLsDIHog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A-10 simulator by DCS</a>. Before you can start the engines, you need to first power the aircraft and perform your receiving checklists, and if you are the first flight of the day, additional first-flight checks. These cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thorough pre-flight walkaround inspection</li>
<li>Powering the airplane on batteries</li>
<li>Transition to ground power (GPU) or start the APU for power</li>
<li>Verifying the state of all systems</li>
<li>Fire test</li>
<li>Stall warning test</li>
<li>Anti-ice system test</li>
<li>Checking oxygen levels and masks</li>
<li>Autopilot test</li>
<li>Backup instrumentation checks</li>
</ul>

<p>Before pushback:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verifying fuel load</li>
<li>Get load information from flight attendant/gate agent/dispatch/ramp supervisor</li>
<li>Calculate weight and balance, move passengers and/or bags if needed</li>
<li>Get ATC clearance and program FMS</li>
<li>Flight crew and cabin crew briefings</li>
<li>Weather briefing </li>
<li>Start APU and disconnect ground power and ground air conditioning</li>
<li>Get clearance for pushback</li>
</ul>

<p>During pushback:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Before engine start"" checklist</li>
<li>Set bleeds / packs for engine start</li>
<li>Communicate with ground crew for engine start</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can start an engine. Unlike a small airplane where you start the engine by turning a key in an ignition switch, <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1959/how-are-turbine-engines-started"">in bigger airplanes its a series of knobs and buttons to press, sometimes dependent on certain events during the start</a>. Engine parameters must also be monitored in case an abort becomes necessary.</p>

<p>At this point you can get a taxi clearance and start moving toward the runway. You'll go through a couple more checklists, ""after start/taxi"" and ""before departure"", to prepare the plane for taxi and takeoff. Once you are on the runway, with all checks completed, with more fuel than your minimum dispatch release, and an ATC clearance you may then release the brakes and go flying. One pilot will fly and the other will monitor instruments. </p>

<p>Much of the above is beyond the typical scope of X-Plane, though some can be addressed with specific aircraft add-ons, manuals and software like VATSIM. </p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of a delta wing compared to a swept wing?","18359","","<p>What advantage does a delta wing have over a swept wing with high AR for supersonic flight? And what disadvantage does a delta wing have over a swept wing with high AR for transonic flight?</p>

<p>The Concorde is made to cruise at supersonic speed--delta wings.</p>

<p>Most commercial airliner--swept wing with high AR.</p>

<p>Would you design a supersonic airplane with the conventional airliner swept wings? On the other hand, would you design a transonic flight with delta wings?</p>
","<h2>Benefits of a delta wing:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Due to the large root <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/5005/what-is-the-chord-of-a-wing"">chord</a>, a delta wing combines low relative wing thickness with a sufficiently thick wing spar for a lightweight structure. Since a low relative thickness keeps <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7451/what-is-the-area-rule/7454?s=12%7C0.1295#7454"">wave drag</a> down (a drag component which occurs only in supersonic flow), this makes delta wings especially attractive for supersonic aircraft.</li>
<li>The large root chord gives the delta wing a high internal fuel volume even at a low relative thickness.</li>
<li>The large root chord also provides it with a large surface area which helps to bring the minimum speed of the aircraft down.</li>
<li>With sufficient leading edge sweep, a delta wing produces <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21069/what-is-vortex-lift/21071#21071"">vortex lift</a>, so <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/5048/why-does-supersonic-flight-detach-airflow-from-a-wing/5055#5055"">flow separation</a> can be turned into a means of increasing lift.</li>
<li>A delta wing is naturally stable in pitch, therefore it does not require a separate tail surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drawbacks of a delta wing:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The large wing area causes more viscous drag for the same amount of lift compared to a high <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/716/what-dictates-the-aspect-ratio-of-an-aircrafts-wing/8797?s=11%7C0.1924#8797"">aspect ratio</a> wing. Swept wings have a better lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) than delta wings.</li>
<li>High-lift devices like fowler flaps are hard to integrate into delta wings. The higher relative thickness of regular airliner wings allows to integrate large flaps more easily, and the rearward location of the trailing edge of a delta wing will produce intolerable pitching moments if such flaps would be deflected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, the moderately swept high aspect ratio wings of subsonic airliners are ideal for flight at high subsonic Mach numbers. Delta wings are superior only in supersonic flight, and due to their good low speed characteristics they offer the best overall compromise for supersonic aircraft.</p>

Note the canard wing, which has little sweep and a low aspect ratio: This kind of wing is ideal for supersonic flight, provided it has a low relative thickness. The main wing of the XB-70 is a delta wing to keep the take-off and landing speeds relatively low and offers the best compromise of low and high speed characteristics. Also, the wing tips could be deflected downwards to improve directional stability at supersonic speed and to improve L/D by using the waverider effect.</p>

"Why are delta wings not commonly used in commercial airliners?","18266","","<p>Delta wings are most commonly seen on military aircraft. I understand that delta wings are ideal for supersonic flight, and provide high maneuverability. </p>

<p>Having high maneuverability and speed are good characteristics for commercial airliners. But, most of the commercial airliners do not use delta wings (Except for Concorde and Tu-144). </p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any specific reasons for this?</li>
<li>Are there any regulations that prevent using delta wings in commercial airliners?</li>
<li>Does it cost more in maintenance?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There's a thread on <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/91699/"" rel=""noreferrer"">airliners.net</a> about the same topic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most prominent and useful aspects of the delta wing is the fact that it increases an airplane's critical Mach number (the speed at which some air passing over any part of an aircraft - usually the wing - reaches Mach 1.0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By increasing the critical Mach number, it makes supersonic flight much more feasible on delta wings than on conventional wings. </p>

<p>Delta wings are particularly happy even at a high AoA (angle of attack). This is because of the reaction lift generated by the wing, and the vortex created at the leading edge of the wing. Hence, airplanes with delta wings have a much higher tolerance to stalling. This makes it easier to attain higher vertical speed, also known as ""rate of climb"" safely.</p>

<p>But on the flip side:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the downsides of deltas is that they create more drag, because of the bigger surface area, but they do have a bigger internal volume (for fuel, for example) which could lead to a smaller fuselage, or more space in the fuselage for other things. Another disadvantage is higher landing and take off speeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last point is particularly important. The Concorde's already small number of usable airports was reduced because the runways needed to be long enough to accommodate for the 160 KIAS landing speeds (for comparison, typical turbofan-based airliners lands at 130-140 KIAS).</p>

<p>As a result of the higher takeoff/landing speeds, the  cost of maintenance of vital components such as the brakes and tyres is higher. Moreover, the high landing speeds can even lead to greater stress on the airframe. So, indirectly delta wings do contribute to a higher cost of maintenance. </p>

<p>Other disadvantages of delta wings I can think of is the lack of a flaps/slats system. Delta wings don't require flaps as they can simply reduce their airspeed by increasing the AoA, but the lack of flaps reduces their subsonic efficiency, and increases the takeoff distance and takeoff velocity. For instance, the Concorde's delta wings produced very little lift during takeoff prior to rotation, necessitating high takeoff speeds of nearly <strong>220 knots</strong>! </p>

<p>As an answer to your second question, I could not find anything about regulations relating to the use of delta wings on airliners.</p>

<p>All in all, delta wings work well for niche purposes such as supersonic aircraft, but their disadvantages and poor operating economics make them impractical for subsonic flight.</p>

<p>However, as you can see here, the now-scrapped Boeing Sonic Cruiser attempted to make the best of both worlds by combining a conventional wing with a delta wing, to form a wide, ""cranked-delta"" wing design.</p>

"Can a commercial airliner sink to the bottom of the ocean?","18225","","<p>Is it possible that a commercial airliner could hit the ocean surface at such an angle that it made a deep dive intact, got filled with water, sank, and got stuck in mud at the floor of the ocean?</p>
","<p><strong>Can a large modern jet airliner plunge intact underwater from flight?</strong></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Large airliners are not desgned for this and are not even strong enough to make a landing on water in less than perfect conditions.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9LoF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
<sup>E.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Airlines_Flight_961"" rel=""noreferrer"">961</a></sup></p>

<p>striking the surface at a larger angle would certainly lead to widespread disintegration.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible for a large modern jet airliner to sink intact?</strong></p>

<p>Yes (as near as makes no difference)</p>

<p>Almost all large aircraft impacting the sea surface in an emergency or uncontrolled will break up immediately and catastrophically.</p>

<p>One notable exception was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549"" rel=""noreferrer"">US1549</a>, an A320, which was landed on water without breaking up. It was described as ""still virtually intact though partially submerged and slowly sinking"". The left engine detached and sank.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m6hja.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So a controlled landing on water is possible under extremely favourable circumstances. It would then be possible for the aircraft to sink in more-or-less one piece without creating a large amount of floating debris.</p>

"Why are planes using rivets & not welded construction?","18167","","<p>I was motivated to ask by this question: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/6312/why-are-airplanes-riveted-and-not-screwed"">Why are airplanes riveted and not screwed?</a></p>

<p>Why not welded construction? Is welding these alloys too difficult? I come from a refining background &amp; in a lot of hazardous duties welded construction has become the norm because integrity is easier to guarantee than screws, bolts or rivets. </p>

<p>Just wondering what's different in aviation? Isn't repair, safety, weight &amp; aerodynamics all better with a welded construction?</p>
","<p>Short answer: High-strength aluminium alloys are tricky to weld correctly. Aluminium is such a fine material for aircraft structures that the need to rivet it is gladly accepted.</p>

<p>Two things are important:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While steel has a temperature range in which it gets more and more runny, aluminium alloys change from solid to liquid within a few degrees. Also, heat conductivity in iron-based alloys is lower than in aluminium, so heating steel locally will keep the surrounding material cooler and more solid compared to aluminium. While welding thin sheets of steel is trivial, it needs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3NTAuDjuYA"">lots of experience in aluminium</a>. For very thin sheets, special equipment like a water-cooled copper backing on which the aluminium sheets rest, so their back is cooled, are needed. Also, the melting temperature of steel and titanium is high enough for it to glow long before it melts, while aluminium will melt without giving you any optical hint of its temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>High-strength aluminium is produced by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_hardening"">progressively aging and precipitation hardening the material</a>. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_aluminium_alloy"">usual alloys use copper</a> atoms dispersed through the aluminium matrix which locally distort the atomic lattice and strengthen it. If they are heated and rapidly cooled by welding, the copper distribution would be changed and the material would be weakened around the welding area. To harden the finished structure again is rather impractical in most cases, so riveting is the better alternative.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A third speciality is the oxide layer on aluminium, which has a higher melting temperature than the base material. You need an AC <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_tungsten_arc_welding"">TIG</a> welder to disrupt the aluminium oxide layer, so your choice of welding techniques is rather limited.</p>

<p>Also, riveted structures are easier to inspect and to repair. Most repairs need to remove aircraft structure for access, and a riveted structure is easier to disassemble and to put together again after the repair using slightly thicker rivets.</p>

<p>My experience with aluminium welding stopped at 4mm thick sheets; while thicker ones were easy to weld, I never managed to weld thinner ones. You sit in front of your structure and heat the spot where you want to start welding. Watching it through the darkened head screen you wait until the spot under the arc becomes glossy, which signals that the surface has started to melt. Now you need to add your welding wire like crazy to keep the spot from heating more, and get the spot moving. If you fail to do so, a second later you will have a hole under your arc, because the aluminium has molten completely and has fallen away. Doing this with 2mm sheets was a pure exercise in futility for me - the moment the surface became glossy it fell away already.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Thanks to @voretaq7 for sharing the link about friction stir welding in the comments! This is made possible by precise positioning of the parts and a computer-controlled welding head and will see wider application in the future. Eclipse Aerospace claims it helps them to avoid 60% of rivets in their jet aircraft.</p>

","<p>There are no major differences between a turboprop used on an airplane and a turboshaft used on an helicopter. All power is collected by the turbine shaft which rotates the blades through a gearbox.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are different types for aero-engines, including turbojet, turbofan, turboprop and turboshaft (I exclude the ramjet which is not used in civilian aviation).</p>

<p>All types are based on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine"" rel=""noreferrer"">gas turbine</a>, but the way the turbine participates to the motion is different.</p>

<p>While airplanes use all types, helicopters cannot use the jet action/reaction principle (tip jet excluded for simplification).</p>

<p>The gas turbine can be the same for turboshaft and turboprop engines, but will be fitted with appropriate elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The rotational speed of the shaft will be adjusted to accommodate the rotor or the propeller. This is done using a gear reduction system. An helicopter rotor turns slower than an airplane propeller.</p></li>
<li><p>Air intake and exhaust are adapted. It rather common to have the air intake on the opposite side of the power output shaft. For a pulling propeller, this means the intake will be aft, and air must be collected forward and ducted to the engine intake.</p></li>
<li><p>The power output shaft is usually used to bear the propeller tension caused by the lift, while on an helicopter, the rotor tension is borne by the frame.</p></li>
<li><p>The accessory box is usually powered by the compressor side of the engine.</p></li>
<li><p>A turboshaft don't provide the bleed air extraction, there is no cabin pressurization required.</p></li>

"Are fighter jets designed to be so inherently unstable that a human can't fly one unassisted?","18059","","<p>I'm told that in order to be more maneuverable fighter jets are designed in a way that makes them impossible for a human to control without the help of a flight computer.  Is this actually true?  Would a modern fighter (like an <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor"">F-22</a> or <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-35"">Su-35</a>) crash if the stability computers died?</p>

<p>Further, if this is true, what design techniques are making them unstable and how do they help with maneuverability?</p>
","<p>My short answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stability is reduced by shifting the center of gravity aft.</li>
<li>Shifting it past the neutral point makes the airplane unstable, so movements away from the trimmed state are accelerated. This increases maneuverability.</li>
<li>Flight computers are multiple redundant, if one dies the others take over.</li>
<li>Slow unstable airplanes can be flown by a human pilot, but not fast unstable airplanes.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the long answer, let me first clarify terms:</p>

<p>Static stability is the tendency of a system to return to it's old state after being disturbed. Take a pendulum: If you pull it to one side, it will return to the middle. Eventually.</p>

<p>Dynamic stability is the tendency of an oscillating system for the oscillations to die down over time. Take the same pendulum: It will swing from side to side, and  friction will ensure this happens with ever smaller amplitude.</p>

<p>Now we need to add dimensions, all three of them: Pitch, roll and yaw. An airplane can be stable in one dimension and unstable in a different one. I understand your question such that you ask about the static pitch stability (or longitudinal stability) of fighter aircraft.</p>

<p>The Wright Flyer was longitudinally unstable (see <a href=""http://authors.library.caltech.edu/21217/1/CULaiaawfp84.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for more). Once aircraft designers learned that aircraft can be made to fly stable, and learned that this is of immense benefit in pilot training, static stability became a requirement for new aircraft. When war in Europe broke out, the British forces were equipped with a superb <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Aircraft_Factory_B.E.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">training aircraft</a>, but it was so stable that it took effort and time to convince it to change course. They were shot down in droves.</p>

<p>From now on, low stability was a prime requirement for fighters and aerobatic aircraft. Static stability is proportional to the control forces (more precisely: To the hinge moment of the respective control surface), so reducing stability gave pilots more response for the same effort. Longitudinal static stability is measured as the relative distance between neutral point (NP) and the center of gravity (CG). See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3902/why-is-managing-cg-centre-of-gravity-important-for-aircraft/3927#3927"">here</a> for more. Longitudinal static stability is achieved by placing the CG ahead of the NP. Shifting the CG back gives you a more responsive airplane, but also one which is more easily disturbed by gusts.</p>

<p>This is the design technique you asked about. Pretty simple, right?</p>

<p>Once you shift the CG aft of the NP, stability is lost and the airplane will increase deviations from the trimmed state. This can be helpful if you want large angle changes, and quickly. An unstable aircraft only needs a small kick and will do the rest of the maneuver all by itself. </p>

<p>This is how it helps in maneuverability. But it is even more helpful to reduce the inertias, especially around the roll axis, for a faster response. That is why all combat aircraft have their engines close to the center.</p>

<p>Of course, negative stability is not acceptable when you need to take your hands off the stick to get a map out or to pee on a long flight. So without computer control, the limit was a CG position near, but not aft of the NP.</p>

<p>With supersonic aircraft, things got more complicated. Now the aircraft operates in two flight regimes, one where lift acts at the quarter chord of the wing and one where it acts at mid-chord. Aircraft with low static stability become very stable in supersonic flight, and the tail surface has to create a high down-force so that the sum of all lift stays where the CG is. Creating lift always incurs a drag penalty, and in supersonic flight it has to be payed twice: One for the excess lift on the wing (which is needed to compensate for the tail's down-force) and one for the down-force on the tail.</p>

<p>Using a flight control computer offers the possibility to allow the pilot to let go of the stick without the aircraft going off course. Now the stick does not command elevator deflection, but pitch rate, and the CG can be moved back from maybe 12% of MAC (mean aerodynamic chord) to -2%. If you compare the wing areas of stable and unstable jets (Jaguar and Mirage F-1 are prime examples), you will see how much is achieved just by going back with the CG by a few percent of wing chord.

<p>Both configurations have the same airfield and combat performance!</p>

<p>Can a human still fly such an aircraft? In glider competitions, the more daring pilots fly with relaxed static stability and have no problem to keep the aircraft under control. Even the Wright brothers could handle their unstable airplane, and handling improved when they moved the CG further back (If you want to know why, please post a new question. This answer is getting too long already!). However, the speed of an aircraft's pitch response is proportional to flight speed (and inverse to the pitch moment of inertia), so faster aircraft are harder to control. You can compare dynamic pressure with the stiffness of a spring: A stiffer spring moves the eigenfrequency of a spring-mass system up, and the same is true for the eigenvalues of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_dynamic_modes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">equations of motion</a> of an aircraft. Given that the reaction time of a good pilot is at least 0.1 s (and more if he/she is tired), it is impossible to counteract motions with frequencies of more than a few Hertz. The lag means that the reaction comes too late and will support the motion. See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faB5bIdksi8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube clip</a> how that works out in practice. This crash was due to wrong signal gains, not a classic instability (after all, the flight computer was still working, but produced too strong elevator deflections).</p>

<p>I would venture to say that a human can still barely fly an unstable jet at low speed (after all, Tom Morgenfeld almost got the YF-22 under control), but once he firewalls the throttle, he will be always behind the plane, and will crash it soon.</p>

<p>Size helps: Bigger planes have lower eigenfrequencies, and light, big vehicles are easy to control, regardless of stability. All Zeppelins were completely unstable in yaw and above the critical airspeed of an airship (again, please ask for a more detailed answer on this aspect) also in pitch, but with one person each for the vertical and the horizontal control surfaces, and enough people on board to rotate them after 2 - 4 hours, nobody felt the need to make Zeppelins naturally stable.</p>

<p>If one computer dies, the others take over. Most unstable configurations have four parallel computers which cross-check their result to catch any malfunction. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_rafale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dassault Rafale</a> uses only three, but adds safety by clever algorithms for checking the results.</p>

<p>So I understand how the chart works, I'm just unclear about the ""Elevation 5,000ft. Altimeter at 29.52"". </p>

<p>My inclination is to assume that the meaning is sea level pressure is 29.52, and therefore we should adjust our input for ""PRESS ALT FT"" to be the altitude that reflects that average pressure, which would be 500 feet.</p>

<p>We round up for safety, so assume PRESS ALT=1000' and TEMP=30° Celsius, we would have a ground roll of <code>890'</code> and a takeoff distance of <code>1645'</code>, right?</p>

<p>Another question: Where do I find the official documentation for converting barometric pressure into the altitude that has that average pressure?</p>

<p><strong>Good thinking, but no.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When the altimeter setting is 29.92, the pressure altitude is the same as the field elevation.</strong>  When the altimeter setting changes, you must apply a conversion factor to the field elevation to get pressure altitude.</p>

<p>In this case, the altimeter setting is 29.52, which means that your conversion factor will be about 380 feet:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jksxg.png"" alt=""Image from PHAK showing altitude correction of 380 feet""></p>

<p>Therefore, the actual pressure altitude will be <strong>5,380</strong> feet.</p>

<p>If you round up for safety, the takeoff distances will be <code>1455</code> and <code>2855</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>We can get a little more precise than that, though.</h2>

<p>To calculate the ground roll at 25 celsius, we can interpolate between 20 and 30 degrees:</p>

<h3>5,000 feet</h3>

<p>$\left[ \left(1315 - 1215\right) \over 2 \right] + 1215 = 1265$ ground roll at 5000</p>

<p>$\left[ \left(2525 - 2320\right) \over 2 \right] + 2320 = 2422$ 50 ft obstacle at 5000</p>

<p>To correct for pressure altitude, we do the same thing at 6000 feet...</p>

<h3>6,000 feet</h3>

<p>$\left[ \left(1455 - 1345\right) \over 2 \right] + 1345 = 1400$ ground roll</p>

<p>$\left[ \left(2525 - 2320\right) \over 2 \right] + 2320 = 2732$ 50 ft obstacle</p>

<h3>5,380 feet</h3>

<p>$\left[ \left(1400 - 1265\right) * 0.380 \right] + 1265 = 1316$ ground roll</p>

"Why does manifold pressure increase with power?","17912","","<p>Whilst writing an answer to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/13715/which-precautions-should-i-take-when-flying-in-very-cold-hot-weather/13722#13722"">this question</a>, I remembered something I don't really understand.</p>

<p>The partial vacuum in the inlet manifold is caused by the piston descending with the inlet valve open during the ""suck"" phase of the Otto cycle.  It is this vacuum that causes fuel to be pushed into the intake, the greater the vacuum, the greater the fuel added to the inlet charge and the greater the power.</p>

<p>Since the needle valve is on the manifold side of the throttle butterfly along with the input to the MAP gauge, why does the manifold pressure <strong>increase</strong> with power?  I would have thought more power, more ""suck"", lower pressure; more pressure, less ""suck"", less fuel.  </p>

<p>I'm obviously wrong since that's not how it works but why?</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3313/why-does-manifold-pressure-increase-when-you-turn-on-carb-heat"">The answers to this question</a> get close but I'm still missing something (and I'm sure will soon be embarrassed by the obviousness of the answer).</p>
","<p>Manifold pressure is actually a measure of the <em>vacuum</em> pressure between the throttle and the cylinders. The more the throttle is opened, the closer that manifold pressure returns to atmospheric pressure.  </p>

<p>The amount of fuel provided to the engine depends on the pressure difference between the manifold and the throttle body.  The throttle body pressure will decrease as the throttle is increased, because of greater rate airflow across the venturi (faster air -> lower pressure).  The manifold pressure will increase as throttle is increased, due to the greater flow of fuel/air mix into the manifold (greater <em>mass</em> of air flowing into a fixed volume -> higher pressure).  So the pressure difference will get larger as the throttle is increased.  </p>

<p>For example, would it be a credible theory that the pilot de-pressurized the 777 flying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370"">Malaysia Airlines Flight 370</a> and flew it off somewhere? </p>
","<p>The answer depends on what kind of aircraft you're talking about, and how much control the crew has over the pressurization systems.</p>

<p>For example, in theory you <strong>could very well reduce or completely shut off the air to the cabin on a 777</strong>. This could also be done by a single crew member alone. The pilots have full control of this system should say the one of the engines produce bad air to that cabin and would needed to be switched off.</p>

<p>As for the oxygen masks- these are for emergency descent use and have a generator that runs out after about 15 minutes. The crew bottles last a bit longer I think, but these will also have a limit, and doing any attempt to break through the bullet-proof cockpit door in those conditions I'd imagine would be very difficult, since I'm not sure you're still picking up the amount of oxygen you normally would.</p>

"Why don't big commercial planes have full aircraft parachutes?","17820","","<p>On smaller aircraft, like some <a href=""http://cirrusaircraft.com/caps/"">Cirruses</a> for example, they have parachutes attached to the body of the aircraft that can help the plane <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/heres-how-a-small-plane-looks-when-it-descends-via-parachute-instead-of-crashing/362105/"">get to the ground safely</a> in an emergency.  </p>

<p>I'm wondering why commercial aircraft (like, say, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737"">Boeing 737</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family"">Airbus A320</a>) don't do this?  I figure it might have to do with the speed a jet moves at, or maybe the altitude, but I was hoping to get a more complete answer by posting the question here...</p>
","<p>The reason for not using full aircraft parachutes can be stitched together by looking at the many related questions. Let me do this for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parachutes will only help when something essential fails at <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2186/why-are-commercial-flights-not-equipped-with-parachutes?rq=1"">sufficient altitude for parachute deployment</a>. As paul said <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9243/why-dont-commercial-jet-aircraft-have-a-break-apart-parachute-escape-system"">here</a>, most accidents happen at take-off and landing where a parachute cannot be successfully deployed.</li>
<li>Parachutes big enough to slow down a whole airliner will be very heavy, reducing payload and increasing the number of flights to transport the same number of passengers. The biggest parachutes designed so far were for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">solid rocket boosters of the Shuttle</a>, and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9243/why-dont-commercial-jet-aircraft-have-a-break-apart-parachute-escape-system"">paul</a> gave their mass a 3 x 990 kg plus 550 kg for the drogue chute. Wikipedia gives the mass of one SRB at 91,000 kg. Scale this for the zero-fuel mass of an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family#A320"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A-320</a> of 62,500 kg, and the mass will be approx. 2,500 kg. That is equivalent to 25 passengers, or 16% of the A-320's capacity. Adding the parachute will translate into 16% more flights, just to compensate for parachute mass. This is most likely underestimating the true impact because I did not add the mass for structural reinforcements.</li>
<li>The opening shock at travel speed would destroy both airplane and chutes. If we want the parachute system to work in as many cases as possible, we need to make deployment possible at up to Mach 0.85, and then the maximum g-load on aircraft and passengers must not exceed 6 g. (See <a href=""http://www.aero.polimi.it/~anghi/bacheca_sp/materiale_didattico/ACSDG_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/6411/aircraft-with-the-pilot-in-a-prone-position-and-g-force-effects/6418#6418"">Eiband diagrams</a> which give time- and direction-dependent limits for the maximum deceleration a human being can survive). This is possible with staggered deployment of several chutes with increasing size, and by sewing parts of the canopy and the parachute's strings together, so they can rip apart during opening, which slows the unfolding process. But I expect that this will add to the mass of the parachute system. It will certainly add to the mass of the aircraft's structure, which is currently limited to <a href=""http://www.satavirtual.org/fleet/A320LIMITATIONS.PDF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">+2.5 / -1.0</a> g.</li>
</ol>

<p>By looking at point 2 above alone, it becomes clear that the addition of parachutes will most likely drive up air travel casualties. If we need 16% more flights to make the cruise part less dangerous, and still <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8447/airline-safety-what-happened-between-1959-and-1962/8452#8452"">most accidents happen during take-off and landing</a> (which are now 16% more numerous), we gain little. Crashes now involve less passengers, but their number goes up. Tickets will become 20% more expensive at least (more if the parachute system costs something, which is very likely), and we all know how the majority of passengers votes when faced with a choice of dearer, somewhat safer flights and 20% cheaper flights at almost the same accident risk.</p>

"How is a missile lock detected?","17734","","<p>I am wondering how a fighter aircraft involved in a face-off detect a missile lock from a trailing aircraft, so that it can make preventive maneuvers?</p>
","<p>To add some data to Matthew's answer: <br/>
Anti aircraft missiles come in basically 4 types (some others have been tried but aren't in common use).</p>

<ol>
<li>Active radar homing</li>
<li>Passive radar homing</li>
<li>Infrared homing</li>
<li>Laser guided</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>Active radar homing has a radar in the missile sending out signals. Those signals can be detected and classified by the target aircraft.</p></li>
<li><p>Passive radar homing has a receiver in the missile reacting to specific signals bounced off of the target by the launching system. These too can be detected and classified by the target aircraft.</p></li>
<li><p>Infrared missiles are completely passive and can't be detected this way.<br/></p></li>
<li><p>Laser guided missiles are like passive radar homing missiles, except they react to reflections of a laser beam rather than a radar signal. These too can of course be detected and classified with appropriate sensors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There have been some attempts at detecting missiles by their own infrared signature, typically their engine exhaust. But this is problematic because most of that is of course blocked from the missile's target by the missile body, and also many missiles will spend a lot of their flight towards the target in an unpowered glide state, thus not having a hot engine exhaust.</p>

<p>Other systems generally can't be detected by the target either. Think optical guidance using a radio link with the missile (while you might be able to detect the link, you can't readily know what it's doing or that you're the target if you do recognise it as a missile guidance link).</p>

<p>Optical guidance using control wires is not generally used with anti-aircraft missiles, but sometimes anti-tank missiles using these systems are used against slow flying aircraft. These are utterly impossible to detect.</p>

"Why can't jet engines operate with supersonic air and how do they slow it down?","17634","","<p>Typically jets cannot operate when intake airflow is supersonic relative to the engine. Why is this so? Also, why are scramjets able to use supersonic air?</p>

<p>To slow down the air to subsonic speeds, the air passes through a shockwave (if I understand correctly). How does this slow down the air?</p>
","<p>To avoid shock waves on the compressor blades which would make the engine unusable both because of the very large pressure fluctuations that would cause fatigue and failure of blades, and because of the high level of drag that is developed in supersonic flows that would have the effect of slowing the blades down as they rotated. In fact the engine just wouldn't run with a supersonic flow going into it. </p>

<p>Also the flow needs to be slowed down as much as possible to allow enough time in the combustion chamber for the fuel to burn completely.</p>

<p>So... a cone or ramp shape at the inlet is used to create a little shockwave in front of the engine slowing down the oncoming air to subsonic speeds and allowing the jet engine to operate efficiently.</p>

<p>A ramjet is able to use the compressed air because it is designed to do so. An excellent case study is the SR-71 Blackbird, which had engine cones that moved forward and backward based on speed/altitude, to transition from a turbine to a ramjet mission profile. (Fun fact: That plane is so darned fast that the limit to it's speed comes not from engine power, but from <em>MELTING THE PLANE</em> because it is going so fast.) The SR-71 had ""Bypass doors"" to close of the main turbine of the engine when operating on a ramjet profile.</p>

<p>A <strong>ramjet</strong>, sometimes referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd, is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incoming air without a rotary compressor. Ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed; they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill. A ramjet powered vehicle, therefore, requires an assisted take off like a JATO to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust. Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around Mach 3. This type of engine can operate up to speeds of Mach 6.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nwUTv.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A <strong>scramjet</strong> is a variant of a ramjet airbreathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow. As in ramjets, a scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to forcefully compress the incoming air before combustion, but a ramjet decelerates the air to subsonic velocities before combustion, while airflow in a scramjet is supersonic throughout the entire engine. This allows the scramjet to operate efficiently at extremely high speeds: theoretical projections place the top speed of a scramjet between Mach 12 and Mach 24.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbUF3.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There are though multi-engine planes that have each propeller rotating different directions, but in the case of <strong>single</strong> propellers, it seems that clockwise rotation is dominant, or even the only option. Is there any <strong>single</strong> propeller plane with counterclockwise rotation?</p>
","<p>I wasn't able to find any good historical references, so this answer is pure opinion.  (sorry).  I'll break this down into two separate questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any reason for single-engine propellers to turn the same way?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes.  When flying, the spin direction of the prop has several effects.  Helical prop wash, p-factor, gyroscopic precession, differing blade angles of attack all are due to the asymmetry of spinning in a single direction.  An experienced pilot will want to understand and compensate for these effects when necessary.  It is easy to see that once this is understood, a single configuration will be preferred within a community to minimize differences between aircraft.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any reason to prefer CW rotation over CCW as a convention in a single engine plane?</li>
</ul>

<p>None that I am aware of.  It appears to be simply an accident of choice.  I had wondered if the majority of engines available to early manufacturers was in that direction and made it preferable, but I couldn't find anything suggesting that.  <strike>Indeed today the majority of automobile engines rotate the opposite direction.</strike>  Making (piston) engines rotate the other direction is not a huge problem.  Twin-engined aircraft and watercraft often have counterrotating engines and propellers.</p>

"What is the maximum wind speed a Boeing 737-800 can deal with during takeoff and landing?","17503","","<p>I'd like to know how safe the Boeing 737-800 is during takeoff and landing when it's windy. What are the maximum wind speeds for cases of tail, head and cross winds? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I've found this resource <a href=""http://www.b737.org.uk/limitations.htm#Wind_Limits"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.b737.org.uk/limitations.htm#Wind_Limits</a>, but I'm quite unable to understand the data:</p>

<p>According to the table (which only shows x-wind data), the max wind speed depends on the so called ""braking action"", but I don't know what exactly is nor what it depends on.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>The same resource points out the max tailwind speed, as well as other info: 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpMz2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpMz2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>As your source shows, the maximum tail wind is fixed and fairly simple.</p>

<p>Getting slightly more complex, there is technically no maximum headwind I'm aware of, although most airports will close when the wind gets much above 50 knots, and even with the wind coming almost straight down the runway, you still get some crosswind component, which factors in. Expect to see many pilots divert in winds much above 40 knots even if the airport is open, especially if gusting to above 50.</p>

<p>Crosswinds are a little different as they depend on the braking action - basically how grippy the runway is. Simplified, you can think of it as a scale from dry weather, through slightly and very wet, then slush and ice. The grippier the runway, the more the tyres will grip and the higher crosswind the aircraft can deal with. The higher numbers in the chart you show are for a dry runway (good on your chart) the lower numbers for wet or icy (poor on your chart) runways.</p>

<p>Although it's written in terms of 'braking action', it's really a measure of grippiness, and it's important both when braking, but also for the ability of the tyres to prevent the aircraft sliding laterally off the runway. This job doesn't solely come down to the tyres, but they're part of it. This is also a large part of the reason why landings and takeoff have different maximum crosswinds on some aircraft.</p>

"Flight Level Change or Vertical Speed - When to use it?","17251","","<p>I've heard that some pilots have this difficulty to determine the correct use of both features. So, which is the difference between using the vertical speed, instead using the flight level change during a descent? When, and how to use it?  </p>
","<p><strong>FLC mode maintains airspeed</strong> during a climb or descent, while <strong>VS mode maintains a specific vertical speed</strong>.</p>

<p>Often air traffic controllers will request that you ""maintain 250 knots in the descent"" or something to that effect, which is much easier to achieve when using Flight Level Change. As another answer points out, by maintaining airspeed, climbs are made safer as the autopilot will not attempt to maintain a rate of climb regardless of whether or not the airspeed is safe.</p>

<p>FLC mode is typically only available in advanced autopilots, and as far as I know they need to connect to an Air Data Computer to get the necessary information.</p>

<p>How to use FLC would depend on the equipment available to you: </p>

<ul>
<li>aircraft with auto throttle will maintain speed and an appropriate rate of descent automatically. </li>
<li>for aircraft without auto throttle you'd set your target altitude, enable FLC, adjust your target speed if needed, and set your throttle for climb or descent to maintain the desired altitude change rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm referencing the Garmin GFC700 as it's the only autopilot I've used with FLC mode, but I imagine the same steps and rules would apply.</p>

"How high can propeller airplanes fly?","17207","","<p>Is there a maximum height a propeller airplane could fly?</p>

<p>Just for comparison: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit"">Low earth orbit</a> is about 160,000m.</p>

<p><strong>Upper bounds</strong>: I don't know. I guess at some point there is not enough air to get lifted.
And nobody build an airplane with solar cells that flies to space.</p>

<p>I guess important factors for such an upper bound are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Weight of the airplane,</li>
<li>Size, shape and speed of the propellers</li>
<li>Speed of the propellers</li>
</ul>
","<p>It is a matter of power source (and engine aspiration in case of air breathing engines), wing loading and aerodynamic efficiency. With current technology, the limit is around 100.000 ft (30 km), as proven by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_aircraft#NASA_Pathfinder.2C_Pathfinder_Plus.2C_Centurion.2C_and_Helios"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pathfinder and especially Helios</a>. I doubt that much more is possible with really useable aircraft.</p>

<p>Aerodynamics first: The altitude factor of $c_l \cdot Ma^2$ tells you how much lift can be produced at a given flight Mach number, and the wing loading then gives you the minimum density for sustained flight. 0.4 is a good value for $c_l \cdot Ma^2$, and 30 kg/m$^2$ is a feasible wing loading for flight at 30 km. See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3343/is-an-atmospheric-geostationary-satellite-feasible-with-current-technology/3348#3348"">this answer</a> for more detail.</p>

<p>If the power source needs ambient air (piston engine), the plane needs triple-stage compressors or turbochargers, which have been <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob_Strato_2C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tested up to 20 km altitude</a> and should be good for maybe 24 km. They are finicky devices; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Condor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing Condor</a> rarely flew at its maximum power because the stages of the turbochargers would oscillate in an alternating sequence of surges. One stage would race ahead, causing the other to surge, which made the first surge and free up the other to race ahead, and so on.</p>

<p>Above approximately 24 km, solar-electric propulsion looks like the best option currently. In all cases you can only fly subsonic, so the minimum practical wing loading will limit the maximum altitude. Aircraft like Helios are very delicate already, so they can only be launched in calm weather and are at risk of being blown away by high altitude winds. Payload is minimal, and depending what the aircraft is supposed to do besides flying high will give you a limit on the maximum altitude between 24 and 30 km.</p>

<p>Going to orbit in a propeller driven device is completely illusory. There is not enough matter to push against at higher altitudes, and the theoretical propeller diameter would be measured in Kilometers (or miles, if you prefer that unit). The structural mass would be prohibitive. Also, propeller thrust is inversely proportional to flight speed, and there is no way to accelerate with a propeller to escape velocity. The thrust would be just a rounding error away from zero at 7.9 km/s.</p>

<p>This speed is required to escape earth's gravity by flying fast enough around it so that the centripetal force equals the aircraft's weight and is called orbital velocity. The higher the orbit becomes, the more energy is required to reach it. In order to gain enough energy, a propeller aircraft would accelerate in the atmosphere to a speed quite a bit higher than the desired orbital velocity and then convert that kinetic energy to potential energy to lift its trajectory above at least 100 km, the internationally recognized altitude where spaceflight starts. Note that this phase of the flight requires inverted flight if the acceleration takes some time. The maximum flight Mach number would need to be maybe 12 or even 15 so this maneuver is possible at all.</p>

<p>In short: Going to orbit with a propeller? Forget it!</p>

  <p>The heading indicator is fundamentally a mechanical
  instrument designed to facilitate the use of the magnetic

  making straight flight and precision turns to headings difficult
  to accomplish, particularly in turbulent air. A heading
  indicator, however, is not affected by the forces that make
  the magnetic compass difficult to interpret.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>OBS</strong> (Omni Bearing Selector) knob is on the CDI, it is not its own instrument. The knob allows the selection (via the outer ring) of the radial (course) you wish to track from a VOR ground station. When tracking a radial you only track left/right deviation and thus only a single needle is required (the first picture you have). For instrument flying you also need to track the glide slope for an approach and thus vertical deviation may also be displayed on a CDI. When on an instrument approach the CDI is used to track the left/right deviation from the runway (not a VOR). </p>

"What is the difference between Best Rate of Climb and Maximum Rate of Climb?","17078","","<p>Is there a difference between <strong>Best</strong> Rate of Climb and <strong>Maximum</strong> Rate of Climb?  </p>

<p>From my research, best rate of climb trades ground distance for altitude (i.e. steeper climb, more altitude per unit time).  Since an aircraft cannot climb faster than its max rate, these appear to be two different labels for the same concept.</p>

<p>Am I missing some nuance between the two?</p>
","<p>Generally when GA pilots talk about climb performance we speak of two different <em>airspeed</em> values:</p>

<p><strong>Best Rate of Climb <em>speed</em></strong> (V<sub>y</sub>) gets you the most altitude per unit time (feet per minute).<br>
When you want to get to cruise altitude quickly for maximum efficiency you'll aim for the best <em>rate</em> of climb so you spend the least time at lower, less efficient altitudes.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Angle of Climb <em>speed</em></strong> (V<sub>x</sub>) gets you the greatest altitude per unit of ground distance (feet per mile).<br>
When you've got a FAA-Standard 50-foot-tree at the departure end of the runway you'll aim for the best angle of climb to ensure you don't wind up in the tree.</p>

<p>Those speeds are useful to us as pilots, but the exact rate of climb (feet-per-minute) for those speeds will vary: A fully loaded plane will climb more slowly than one that's just got the pilot and a few gallons of fuel on board, and that's where the ""maximum rate of climb"" enters into the discussion:</p>

<p><strong>Maximum rate of climb</strong> is the number of feet per minute you can get climbing at the ""best rate of climb"" airspeed.</p>

<p>If someone is being sloppy in their usage ""Maximum Rate of Climb"" could mean ""Best Rate of Climb"" (pitch for V<sub>y</sub> and you get what you get), but if you're being precise in your usage and really talking about the <em>rate</em> of climb it would mean <a href=""http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~lutze/AOE3104/climb.pdf"">the theoretical maximum rate of climb</a> in feet per minute based on the current conditions and aircraft weight.</p>

<hr>

<p>Maximum rate of climb under a given set of conditions is useful information to know if you need to clear terrain at some point on your flight path and want to be sure you can climb fast enough to do so: If you're starting from sea level and need to clear a 5000 foot mountain that's 5 minutes away but your plane can't manage more than 500 feet per minute at best-rate-of-climb speed under the current conditions you'll need to reconsider your flight plan to either avoid the mountain or climb in a circle somewhere until you can clear it.</p>

"What is the weight budget of a fully loaded A380?","17047","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A380"">Wikipedia</a> provides some numbers (typical empty weight, MTOW, max fuel capacity, etc.), but I can't seem to find more detailed figures. For a purpose of this question, let's assume a fully loaded A380 in typical 3-class configuration (~530 passengers) and fuel for a long haul flight (>10h).</p>

<p>So, what is the typical weight of the passengers + luggages? Is any additional cargo typically carried? If so how much? What about the weight of crew and catering? And fuel weight? (Fuel weight will depend on actual flight duration, so the answer should mention the corresponding flight duration.)</p>
","<p>These weights are all based on the maximum an aircraft will ever see. The maximum allowed weight of passengers (+luggage) and cargo (called payload weight) is the difference between the <strong>Operational empty weight</strong> (about 270,000 kg) and the <strong>Zero fuel weight</strong> (361,000 kg). This means the payload weight is about 91,000 kg. The passenger and crew weight can be estimated by the following numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>175 lbs per pax + 30 lbs of baggage for short medium range distance (or 40 lbs for long range)</li>
<li>175 lbs per crew member + 30 lbs of baggage$^1$</li>
</ul>

<p>So let's say that (for easier calculations) the average passenger + luggage weight is 100 kg.
When we assume 530 passengers and 25 crew, then the weight would be $555\times100=55,000kg$. That leaves 36,000 kg for cargo.
All the weights listed are, of course, maximum weights. That means that an aircraft in general does not meet these values.</p>

<p>The maximum fuel weight is the difference between <strong>maximum ramp weight</strong> and <strong>zero fuel weight</strong> (which is $562,000-361,000=201,000kg$). About 2,000 kg is taken for the time the engines are running while the aircraft did not yet take of (for taxiing etc). This is the difference between maximum ramp weight and MTOW.</p>

<p>The amount of fuel varies so much per flight that I really can't say anything about it. It depends on the air pressure in the flight path (aircraft choose their routes depending on that, for a faster flight), weather along the route, and much more. For quite a good overview I suggest for you to read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_planning#Fuel_calculation"" rel=""nofollow"">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

"Why don't pilots parachute from small planes that are in distress?","16998","","<p>There was <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2186/why-are-commercial-flights-not-equipped-with-parachutes"">another question</a> that asked why commercial flights don't have parachutes.  The almost ubiquitous response was that the parachutes would be useless because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most accidents with commercial airliners happen on take off and landing, and there is no time to parachute.</li>
<li>In order to get to a position where 100+ people can successfully jump out, you'd most likely need to descend some 20,000 ft and then maintain straight and level for a good 3 to 5 minutes once you got past 12,000 (so people have oxygen to breathe when they jump).  And if you can descend and maintain level flight, you might as well land.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what about in a light, single engine plane (think <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cessna 172</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Piper Cherokee</a>)?  Engine failures in small aircraft, for example, seem to be more common, so you have more accidents that start high above the ground.  Thus, you usually have a few minutes before you're going to hit the ground and there's often only 1 or 2 passengers (rather than 100). Plus, you're usually already at an altitude where you don't need oxygen to bail out.</p>

<p>With that in mind, couldn't you put the plane into a shallow dive to keep it from stalling, trim it to keep it going straight and then bail out?  It seems like a somewhat practical solution, yet I have never heard of anyone doing it. </p>

<p>Why do pilots often try to find a road to land on or a lake to ditch in when trouble strikes instead of just bringing a parachute and bailing out?</p>
","<p>Mainly because in the situation that you describe, the airplane is perfectly capable of flying.  You don't <strong>need</strong> an engine to fly as airplanes are designed to glide without it. Part of every pilots training is how to land the airplane when this happens. </p>

<p>Many of the same issues also apply in the smaller airplanes.  Unless the pilot and the passengers fly around with their parachutes on, it would be quite difficult to put them on in the confined space, in a high stress situation, and with the very limited time available.  Even if they did, untrained people are going to be hurt (probably quite badly) during the landing even if everything else with the jump goes well. (See my answer on your linked question for some of the things that can go wrong during the jump.)</p>

<p>You are also creating a hazard with the aircraft not being piloted and crashing into a random place on the ground.  All of this when the airplane could have just glided in for a landing in a field or on a road.  Most of these types of emergencies end quite well, and even a lot of the accidents will have fewer injuries and deaths than if people were jumping out all of the time. As an added bonus, the airplane can even be used again! </p>

<p>On the other hand, a major structural failure that makes the aircraft incapable of flight could be a reason to jump.  This is <strong>extremely</strong> rare however, and even if one has a parachute in this situation it may be impossible to exit the airplane safely because of high G forces and the possibility of hitting the airplane as you are both tumbling through the sky.  </p>

<p>Some manufacturers are now building <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_Recovery_Systems"">ballistic parachutes</a> into the airplane which can bring the entire airplane down safely in these situations.  This is much more safer, reliable, and does  have a positive impact on safety in these extremely bad situations.  For just an engine failure though, I doubt that most pilots would even fire the ballistic parachute if there were suitable landing spots within gliding distance. </p>

<p>My view is that you would have a far greater safety impact by requiring everybody in a moving car to wear a helmet.  Would it improve safety?  Absolutely.  Would people want to do it?  A few would (and perhaps a few do), but the general population doesn't want to be inconvenienced by something that is only a remote possibility.  The odds of a parachute helping you in a typical GA airplane is far more remote than the odds of the helmet helping you in a car.</p>

"What are the differences between Normal and Utiltiy Categories","16979","","<p>In the operating handbooks for GA aircraft, there are often weight and balance limitations listed for both <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Utiltity</strong> category operation.  If I restrict the loading to the Utility category envelope, I want to know what regulations and prudence allow me to do over the Normal category envelope.</p>

<p>I am guessing that there are a set of regulatory certification standards for each category, as well as a list of specific restrictions for each type certificate.  What are these definitions and where are they found?</p>
","<p>From a regulatory standpoint the governing regulation is FAR 23 (airworthiness standards for what we'd generally call ""small"" airplanes - Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, and Commuter category). </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.10.1.59.3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAR 23.3</a> is probably what you're interested in, and tells us:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Normal Category</strong> is limited to airplanes that have a seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of nine or less, a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less, and intended for nonacrobatic operation.<br>
They go on to specify that nonacrobatic operation includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any maneuver incident to normal flying<br>
(for very vanilla definitions of ""normal"" - they expect you to use some common sense here!)</li>
<li>Stalls (except <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/18859/what-is-a-whip-stall"">""whip stalls""</a>)</li>
<li>What most pilots recognize as the ""commercial flight test maneuvers"": Lazy eights, chandelles, and steep turns, but with an angle of bank not greater than 60 degrees in any of these maneuvers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Utility Category</strong> is the same type and size of airplane, but approved for ""limited acrobatic operations"" - this <em>may</em> include intentional spins, as well as the ""commercial maneuvers"" with higher bank angles (greater than 60 degrees, up to 90 degrees).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acrobatic Category</strong> is the same type and size of airplane, but approved for acrobatics  without any restrictions ""other than those shown to be necessary as a result of required flight tests"" -- basically ""airplanes that can go upside-down"".</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The commuter category is boring: It's basically the normal category, but with more engines (at least 2) and more seats (up to a maximum of 19). Commuter category aircraft can also have a higher maximum takeoff weight (up to 19,000 pounds).</p>

<p>An aircraft can be certificated in any combination of the Normal, Utility, and Acrobatic categories if the aircraft meets the requirements of the appropriate category (as specified later in FAR 23).  An aircraft certificated in the Commuter category may not be certificated in any of the other categories however.</p>

<p>Generally the restrictions you find on aircraft are not regulatory ones (from the FARs) but Operating Limitations (in the POH or placarded on the aircraft) which you must comply with (per Part 91 of the FARs).  </p>

<p>For example, the Cessna 172 and the Piper Warrior are both dual-category aircraft (Normal and Utility), and specify a ""Utility Category CG Envelope"" in their weight and balance charts.</p>

<p>The Piper Warrior is <em>not</em> approved for spins in the utility category (they are placarded with <code>SPINS PROHIBITED</code>). they also have other restrictions for utility category operations which are found in the POH and on aircraft placards (e.g. <code>UTILITY CATEGORY - NO BAGGAGE OR AFT PASSENGERS</code>, and maximum entry speeds for other acrobatic maneuvers).</p>

<p>Most Cessna 172s <em>are</em> approved for spins in the utility category and are not placarded against them. (Certain aircraft with specific STOL kits installed are <em>disapproved</em> as a result of the kit, and have placards prohibiting them).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the formation of the vortex, the pressure inside it decreases significantly as compared to the ambient pressure. This results in a significant drop in dew point (which was already below the ambient temperature before the formation of the vortex) but along with it, there is an even greater drop in the vertex core temperature, which transforms the water vapour into water droplets and hence we are able to see the vortices trail coming out of the rear endplates.</p>

"Are there advantages when operating with CG near forward or aft limits?","16851","","<p>If the center of gravity of an airplane is too far aft, it will become more unstable</p>

<p>Iif the CG is too far forward, then drag will increase due to increased angle of attack.</p>

<p>But what are the benefits to operating with the CG near the aft, or forward, CG limits? In what situations would one choose to do so?</p>
","<p>A CG near the aft reduces drag by reducing the necessary downforce that has to be supplied (usually) by the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/439/95"">tailplane</a>.<br>
This is also a point for competition gliding (more often than not you have water ballast in the vertical tailplane to compensate for those love handles). Aerobatic gliders sometimes feature aft lead ballast to enable maneuvers like tailspins which are not possible with a forward CG. </p>

<p>Aft CGs come with reduced stability, which can be a severe flight-safety concern (e.g. in case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28flight%29#Unrecoverable_spins"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unrecoverable spins</a>).<br>
Some fighter aircraft feature inherently unstable aerodynamics (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermaneuverability#High_aerodynamic_maneuverability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">super-maneuverability</a>) which offer great agility (e.g. turning rates), but need constant input by a flight constrol system (and woe if that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Q0Qywyd_4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fails</a>, e.g. via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot-induced_oscillation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pilot Induced Oscillation</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>A forward CG results in greater flight stability and reduced danger of sudden stalling, but also increased drag (because of the increased downforce required from the tailplane).

<p>When the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trijet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tri-jets</a> were developed, no sufficiently large and powerful engines were available. They were already cheaper to operate that the four-engined aircraft, and too large to have sufficient power with just two.

<p>Another reason is increased engine reliability: With three or four engines, an engine failure is less of a problem than with just two engines per airplane. Previously, route planning had to keep a maximum distance of 60 flight minutes to a diversion airport. In 1964, this was waived for three-engined aircraft, but twins were still bound to this restriction.

"What is a 'deep stall' and how can pilots recover from it?","16673","","<p><a href=""http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050816-0"">West Caribbean Airways Flight 708</a> which crashed in 2005, fell victim when their plane encountered a deep-stall. From my understanding, only certain planes can 'deep-stall'</p>

<p>How can pilots recover their plane to recover from a deep stall?</p>
","<p>A deep stall or a super stall is a condition where the wake of the wing impinges on the tail surface and renders it almost ineffective. The wing is fully stalled, so the airflow on its upper surface separates right after the leading edge, which produces a wide wake of decelerated, turbulent air. Consequently, the dynamic pressure at the tail surface is much smaller than in unstalled flight, which is the main reason for the reduced effectiveness.</p>

<p>Consider this case: The aircraft flies in a nose-up attitude, but on a downward flight path. Consequently, the angle of attack of the wing $\alpha$ is much beyond its normal operating range, causing a fully separated upper surface flow. Due to the T-tail configuration, the wake is hitting the elevator such that all of it is shielded from the regular airflow.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WufBe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The pitching moment of this configuration over angle of attack (blue line) looks something like this. First there is a stable region with a negative gradient at low values of $\alpha$, followed by a minimum when the wing stalls, and then a region with a positive gradient, where the separation unfolds and the tail moves into the wake from above. This region is unstable in pitch, so without control input the aircraft will not stay there, but either pitch down or up until it reaches a stable region again. At high angles of attack follows another stable region with a negative gradient:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r1g2r.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Note that we have two trim points, one in the regular range of the angle of attack, and one way out to the right. In both cases the aircraft has a stable trim condition, so small disturbances are answered with force changes which will keep the aircraft at one of these points. Between the two, there is another equilibrium point, but here the airplane is unstable. If it pitches up slightly there, the pitch up will accelerate until it reaches the upper trim point.</p>

<p>Now consider the control power of the horizontal tail. When it flies in undisturbed air, it can trim a wide range of angles of attack. In the deep stall condition, however, its control power is much reduced, resulting in a much smaller range of trimmable angles of attack. If the lower end of this range is right of the point where the pitching moment crosses into positive values (here at $\alpha$ = 24°), the aircraft cannot escape with elevator deflections!
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5JWlX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Please note that the control power is not sufficient to enter the deep stall with quasi-stationary trim changes. The pilot needs to pitch up quickly and has to overshoot the static trim range in order to cross into the stable region above 30° angle of attack. There, his range of trimmable $\alpha$s is too small to achieve the same overshoot backwards.</p>

<p>To get out of this trap needs other changes: Either shift the center of gravity forward, or try to drop one wing. Unfortunately, both the ailerons and the rudder will also be much less effective due to the massive separation and the wake. In a number of cases, even experienced test pilots could not escape this condition.</p>

"Why does the B-52 take off without rotating?","16667","","<p>In the answer to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/21594/8730"">this question</a> it is noted that the B-52 takes off without <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_%28aeronautics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rotating</a> and climbs out in a nose-down attitude. Why was it designed this way?</p>
","<p>The reason was to give the bombs the place close to the center of gravity.</p>

<p>Wing sweep (for high cruise Mach numbers) in combination with a high aspect ratio of the wing (for low induced drag) made it impossible to place the landing gear in the wing, so it had to be integrated into the fuselage. The main landing gear normally needs to be <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/16447/landing-gear-position-on-caravan/16455?s=1%7C0.3305#16455"">close to the center of gravity</a> (slightly behind for a tricycle gear, slightly ahead for a taildragger), but this space was needed for the massive bomb bay. Since the bombs will be dropped somewhere along a bombing mission, dropping them should not upset the balance of the aircraft, so no compromise was possible.</p>

<p>This problem existed already during the development of the 6-engined <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-47_Stratojet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">B-47</a> a few years before. In both designs, two pairs of landing gears were chosen, one pair ahead and one pair aft of the bomb bay, and the aircraft lost its ability to rotate for takeoff. Due to the powerful fowler flaps the attitude in cruise and at slow speed could be made identical. The downside is more drag during the take-off run, since the wing produces more lift, but this could be tolerated in a strategic bomber with air refueling capabilities.</p>

They also had to put the bomb bay into the center fuselage and the main gear had to be placed so far aft that the M-50 could not be rotated the usual way with the elevator. To solve the problem, the engineers devised what they called the ""galloping bicycle"". When the aircraft reached 300 km/h, the forward gear rapidly extended to rotate it to 10°.</p>

"What is the best method to time your round out or flare in Cessna 172?","16521","","<p>I am a student pilot and I usually round out too high and I am not sure why. Can somebody  guide me how to make decision whether I am too high or not.</p>
","<p>There are some good answers here. I would just like to add a few points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I don't like this idea of feeling for ground effect. I think this is unreliable, and will be different in different aircraft and conditions. I can only imagine the aircraft in a steeper than usual descent when I think of this, and not detecting ground effect because you have flown through it and hit the ground - hard.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to memorise the picture on the ground before take off, when sat in the cockpit. This will help.</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware of your peripheral vision, particularly around the sides of the dash (if you can see the runway that is). So while you should be looking in the middle distance, when the sides of the runway reach the same level as you, you are there.</p></li>
<li><p>You should always have some sink rate, so flaring too much and flying level or climbing, is clearly not right. So for example, rather than just pulling back on the stick to flare, reduce power at the same time as flaring just a little. That should increase your sink unless you are still a bit fast (Actually, if it does not thats an indicator that you are a bit fast).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you see lots of pilots kind of ""feeling for the ground"" by pulling back and then easing off then pulling back some more. Eventually the aircraft runs out of airspeed and falls the last 5 feet or so and the landing isn't too bad. A better technique would be to fly to the runway, fly level a little while, and just trying to keep the aircraft level by gradually applying back pressure. The gradual reduction in speed does the rest.</p>

<p>Also relax! And practice! That's the hard bit given the cost of flying!</p>

<p>P.S. I'm not a flight instructor, my only claim to fame is successfully landing a full motion 737 sim once with no instruction apart from air traffic responding to my Mayday call and telling me to fly the initial approach at 170 and threshold 130 (and giving me vectors to the ILS). Hope this helps you though.</p>

<p>The actual rule is long and verbose, but pretty common sense. The important <em>regulatory</em> bits for most personal aircraft are just two points though. You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have ""an adequate number"" of self-contained ash trays<br>
You don't want flicked ash or a snubbed cigarette to start an in-flight fire.</li>
<li>Have ""No Smoking"" signs you can illuminate, if the passenger/crew compartments are separated<br>
This doesn't apply to most of us since our ""personal"" airplanes are light singles, but if you've got a fancy twin with a curtain or door between you and the passengers you'll need those signs.</li>
</ul>

<p>For ""commuter category"" aircraft there are <em>even more</em> requirements. Those requirements don't apply to most ""personal"" planes, so even though it's probably a good idea to meet some of those requirements if you're going to allow smoking in your personal aircraft they're not <em>legally required</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>All that said, while it's <em>likely</em> legal (unless you've removed your ashtrays or your plane didn't come with them) common sense generally dictates you don't want to smoke in your plane - It's bad for the vacuum-driven instruments' filters, will require even more attention to cleaning the inside of your windows, and a loose cigarette in turbulence or a bunch of ashes blown about by an open air vent can be a pretty substantial distraction.</p>

"What is a ""cross check""?","16222","","<p>Shortly before take-off, and again before landing, the cockpit (no way to tell whether it was the Captain or First Officer) came on over the speakers, stating:</p>

<p>What is a cross-check?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.askthepilot.com/how-to-speak-airline/"">This website</a> has the definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crosscheck is a generic term used by pilots and flight attendants

"Is it illegal for Joe Public to listen to ATC in the UK?","16215","","<p>I recall that in the UK (unlike in the rest of the world) we have a law forbidding the listening to of air traffic control, dating back a century, to the days of paranoia over spies!</p>

<p>What is this law, exactly? Is it illegal for a member of the public to listen to live ATC in the UK? Are there any exceptions?</p>

<p>It seems like something of a grey area, but some sources claim that listening to a delayed feed (or historical recording) works around this law; is this true?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/spectrum-enforcement/guidance"">Yes, it is illegal</a>.  </p>

<p>The UK has some <em>very strange ideas</em> about Radio, which bear no resemblance to the reality of physics and how radio actually works. Foremost among those ideas is the idea that you are only legally allowed to listen to transmissions intended for ""general reception"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The services that can be listened to under the definition of general reception are:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>licensed broadcasting stations;</li>
  <li>amateur and citizens' band radio transmissions; and</li>
  <li>weather and navigation transmissions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Radio scanners should not be used to listen to any other radio services, including illegal radio stations (pirates) (by virtue of the fact that they are not licensed radio stations).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aviation-band transmissions are not on Ofcom's list, so even though they are broadcast entirely ""in the clear"" and anyone with an appropriately tuned AM receiver could hear them you are legally prohibited from listening to them.</p>

<hr>

<p>Providing feeds to LiveATC would also appear to be a violation, though it's not clear to me that listening to LiveATC streams would put <em>the listener</em> in violation of the law.</p>

<p>From the same Ofcom site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… it is illegal to listen to anything other than general reception transmissions unless you are either a licensed user of the frequencies in question or have been specifically authorised to do so by a designated person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… it is also illegal to tell a third party what has been heard in a transmission a person has listened to illegally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So anyone <strong>providing UK aviation band transmissions to LiveATC</strong> <em>may</em> be in violation of both of those laws, but I'm not certain what that means for LiveATC <em>listeners</em> (that would be a question to ask Ofcom).</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why was this cockpit much more complex than any other modern day aircraft</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, as others have noted, you imply Concorde was modern when you compare it with ""other modern"" aircraft. OK, it was a ""jet-age"" aircraft, but it wasn't a 21st Century design. it was designed before ""glass cockpits"" were possible, in the 1960s. There were no real multifunctional displays then, so there had to be a switch or dial for every possible action and every possible parameter the pilots might need to know about.</p>

<p>The main difference is probably the flight engineer's panel on the right. Modern aircraft have two pilots in the cockpit and no flight engineer. I imagine that increased automation in engine controls mean that the engine management by the crew is much simpler and requires fewer controls and dials. These are now typically located in the center of the main instrument panel above the thrust levers etc.</p>

<p>For comparison, here's (a somewhat poorly stitched panorama of) a 747 cockpit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>or a fighter jet?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of the controls and instruments are duplicated in a two-pilot cockpit. In a fighter jet, you only see one set of instruments and controls. Also a one-engine plane will have a quarter the engine controls of a four engine plane. Fighters probably lack an APU.</p>

<p>Although fighters have additional switches etc for armaments, airliners have additional switches etc for passenger related facilities (seatbelt lights, a/c? etc), security (cockpit door), cabin-crew comms and so on. They also may have more fuel tanks and maybe more means to move fuel around in flight to trim the aircraft. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It looks to have much more buttons and controls,</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern glass cockpits just hide all that complexity, just imagine you could rotate 90% of what you see out of view.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>and very small(interesting) screens.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no screens at all. There is a colourful moderately-complex artificial horizon instrument which also shows aircraft attitude and a few other things. The visual part is essentially mechanical rather than created by a light-emitting digital display.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Also, its steering was much different than you would see in any other aircraft.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shape of the control yoke may be slightly unusual but it operates the same was as any more common yoke design. You push it forward and back to control the pitch using the elevator (or elevons) and you rotate the top part left or right to control roll using ailerons (or equivalent control surfaces). There are buttons on the had grips to control a few functions. I think the shape was partly to make it easier to get in and out of the seat.</p>

"Are “Kennedy Steve’s” various jokes allowed in ATC communications?","16049","","<p>Forgive me if there is an obvious answer to this, but I was just listening to this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtnsp5qQKS0&amp;list=PL_ei74pHoe4qfmuVrmQYP1LLJL25paqnr&amp;index=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">“Kennedy Steve” playlist</a>, and he seems to joke a lot more than most ground controllers I’ve listened to.</p>

<p>I have three questions about this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it legal for air traffic controllers to joke on the air at all, and definitely this much?</li>
<li>Are Ground controllers held to the same rules regarding communication as Tower, Approach/Departure, or Center?</li>
<li>Is it more serious for a pilot to start joking on ATC, or for a controller to, in terms of consequences?</li>
</ol>
","<p>(US-based answer)</p>

<p>Yes, it's legal. Yes, everyone - including pilots - is held to the same standard of professionalism. And there are no real consequences for anyone (usually). The simple fact is that we're all human beings and humor, slang and jokes are all part of how we communicate and even handle stress.</p>

<p>Legally, the FAA doesn't regulate radio communication, the FCC does. Of course, the FAA has aviation regulations and guidelines that apply, but they're very general (as they should be). Using standard phraseology is strongly encouraged at all times for clearer, quicker communication. <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/ATC.pdf"">The ATC orders</a> 2-4-14 say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the words or phrases in radiotelephone and interphone
  communication as contained in the P/CG or, within areas where
  Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is in use, the
  phraseology contained in the applicable CPDLC message set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, stick to standard phrasing. But there's nothing in there about avoiding humor or jokes.</p>

<p>As for different controllers, they all follow the same standards for radio use no matter where or on which frequency they're working. In my experience, the quieter the frequency the more likely it is that someone - controller or pilot - will joke or even have a brief conversation. I was once taxiing a C172 to the far end of a 12,000ft runway - which takes some time - and the tower controller asked me a few short questions about my accent, where I was from etc. But I was the only aircraft on his frequency at the time and I'm sure he wouldn't have done it if it would have impacted operations or safety in any way.</p>

<p>Which brings me to your final point. In normal circumstances, no one cares about this stuff at all because a) it has no significant impact on anything, and b) it makes life a little more interesting for everyone. It's practically impossible to fly cross-country for more than half an hour without hearing someone make a joke, chat with someone else (briefly), or even complain about something. And again, in normal circumstances that's completely fine: no one expects pilots and ATC to act like robots with a limited vocabulary.</p>

<p>But, if a joke or non-standard phraseology causes offence or a misunderstanding or - in the worst case - an incident of some kind then the FAA or NTSB could be interested. <a href=""http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/directline/dl7_say.htm"">This column</a> from <a href=""http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/"">NASA's ASRS team</a> has some examples of reports of problems causes by non-standard phraseology, including this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I called for clearance to St. Louis as follows: 'Clearance delivery,
  company ident, ATIS info, federal aid to St. Louis.' Federal aid was
  meant to mean FAA clearance in a joking fashion. The Controller
  misinterpreted this to mean that we were being hijacked and called the
  FBI and airport police...I used no 'standard' phraseology to indicate
  nor was it my intent to indicate we had a hijacking...I will use
  absolutely standard phraseology in the future..."" (# 248982)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href=""http://www.flyingmag.com/news/audio-atc-joke-causes-boeing-777-abort-landing"">this incident</a> got quite a lot of attention, even <a href=""http://www.ajc.com/news/business/air-traffic-controller-restricted-after-telling-de/ngMfW/"">outside the aviation press</a>. I don't think it makes sense to say that it's 'more serious' for ATC to make jokes than pilots because every incident is different anyway.</p>

<p>All in all, joking on the radio is like joking in any professional context: if it doesn't disrupt your work or other people's work, if you're not insulting people or wasting their time, and if you're not saying anything stupid or dangerous then no one really minds.</p>

"In an airliner, does the Captain or the First Officer fly the airplane?","16028","","<p>If there is such a thing as a 'normal' flight (in a commercial airliner), who flies the plane? Is it usually the Captain, the First Officer, or whomever needs the hours?</p>
","<p>At the commercial airline level, there is very little difference between a captain and a first officer, other than the amount of time that they have been at the company (seniority).</p>

<p>Typically, each of the two pilots takes turns flying the airplane.  For instance, if today's trip is from Miami to Charlotte to Chicago to Atlanta to Miami, the captain may fly from Miami to Charlotte, the first officer from Charlotte to Chicago, the captain from Chicago to Atlanta, and the first officer from Atlanta back to Miami.</p>

<p>The duties in the cockpit are divided between the <strong>Pilot Flying</strong> (PF) and the <strong>Pilot Not Flying</strong> (PNF)/<strong>Pilot Monitoring</strong> (PM).  These duty positions are independent of the captain/first officer designation.  The PF is responsible for physically flying the airplane (usually only during takeoff and landing) and for controlling the autopilot.  If the autopilot acts up, the PF immediately takes over.</p>

"Can the cockpit windows on commercial airliners open during flight?","15848","","<p>I  observed that the cockpit windows on the commercial airliners actually open - good for a hot day while waiting on the airfield, I suppose. Is there a mechanism which prevents the window from being opened when airborne? </p>
","<p>I'm sure that the cabin pressure difference prevents this at altitude when the cabin is pressurized, due that they often slide inwards and then to the side.</p>

<p>That being said, Boeing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQZzTPd1HJw"">produced a video</a> showing that it's no problem flying with an open window on the 737 if say it opens on takeoff. You can close it assuming it's not damaged or you can land with it. They also showed that the <strong>side window can be opened in flight</strong> in case for instance visibility is impaired through the main window, and while it hardly looks comfortable, it can be done. This assumes that the cabin is unpressurized.</p>

<p>For Vulcans, I can speak with first hand experience.  Each crew member had a stainless steel ""pee tube"", a funnel, which fed into a rubber bladder.  They are emptied and cleaned during the after flight inspection.</p>

<p>I was changing a radio under the rear crew table where the electronics, navigator and radar operator sat.  This involved squeezing down behind the seats to lie under the table, disconnecting and unfastening the radio, hauling onto your chest then pushing it up onto one of the seats and reversing the process to get out from under the table.</p>

<p>As I pushed the radio up onto the seat, I knocked one of the pee tubes and bladders out of it's clip holder which then emptied the contents onto me and the radio.</p>

"What exactly is a QRH?","15837","","<p>In <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2854/when-are-aircraft-required-to-dump-fuel-for-emergency-landings/2856?noredirect=1#comment5587_2856"">this question</a> about aircraft dumping fuel I was told that there may possible be guidance in the QRH.  I know that there are a lot of guidelines given to pilots, but I've never heard of this one.  Would anyone care to explain, from a pilots perspective, what exactly a QRH is and how it's used in modern aircraft operation?</p>
","<p>A QRH is a Quick Reference Handbook and is an approved (by some overseeing entity) document specific to an airplane and operator that contains checklists for just about anything the airplane can experience.  At my airline we had copies in the airplane and also in our company flight manual (CFM).</p>

<p>The entry point into a QRH checklist is one of a few things</p>

<ol>
<li>Memory items</li>
<li>EICAS message</li>
<li>An abnormal event</li>
</ol>

<p>For option 1, there are various checklists that must be memorized and performed at a moments notice with no reference to the checklist.  Some of these are things like trim runaways, engine fire/severe damage, emergency descent.  Once the memory part of the checklist is complete you refer to the printed version of the checklist in the QRH to verify and perform additional steps beyond the part you were required to memorize.</p>

<p>For the other options, any time anything abnormal happens or an EICAS message is presented, there are indices by procedure name and also by EICAS message into a specific procedure in the QRH to follow.  These procedures may reference other procedures.</p>

<p>For example, If I were to experience a dual engine failure, I would pick up my QRH and find the procedure ""DUAL ENGINE FAILURE"", this procedure says I should have the master warning light illuminated (and an aural triple chime) and I should see the EICAS message (in red) ""ENG 1-2 OUT"".  After verifying this presentation and verifying I am in the right procedure, I would perform:</p>

<pre><code>Airspeed....................MINIMUM 260 KIAS
Altitude....................MAXIMUM FL250
Oxygen Mask (if required)...DON
APU.........................START
ENGINE AIRSTART procedure...PERFORM  (note, this is another QRH procedure)

CAUTION: IF THE APU HAS BEEN USED TO START THE ENGINES, 
         DO NOT ALTERNATE THE FADECs AFTER START

Note: If the APU is not available, only equipment supplied by the 
      Essential DC Bus 1 and 2 will be available.  Engine windmilling 
      should drive engine driven hydraulic pumps and supply hydraulic
      pressure.

<p>Advantages of ducted fans would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduced noise</li>
<li>Better containment of broken blades</li>
<li>protection of ground personnel when the engine is running</li>
<li>Smaller size than a comparable propeller</li>
<li>They look like a fancy jet engine. This is probably the main motivation of Airbus for their use on the E-Fan.</li>
</ul>

<p>For almost all aircraft designers, their drawbacks have weighed more heavily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less efficiency, because a smaller <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8819/is-there-any-equation-to-bind-velocity-thrust-and-power/8822#8822"">mass of air</a> is used for propulsion</li>
<li>Additional friction drag and weight from the shroud</li>
</ul>

<p>The highest propulsion efficiency is possible with a large, slow-spinning prop. Once flight speeds approach the speed of sound, the propeller has to become smaller to avoid supersonic propeller tips, and then the shrouded design becomes more attractive. Electric airplanes so far are not fast enough to profit from this effect. I would be very skeptical of the increased thrust claim - both efficiency and thrust of the E-Fan ducted fans are lower than what a well-designed propeller can offer.</p>

<p>The addition of the shroud only increases thrust when compared to the naked fan, but the fan is a poor replacement for a decent propeller at low speed.</p>

  be sufficient.  Many pilots do not realize that this distinction is
  ATC's way of prioritizing two or more aircraft with an emergency at

<p>She also included some of the most important factors to consider when deciding to declare an emergency:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Is the aircraft in immediate danger?</li>
  <li>Does the aircraft require immediate assistance?</li>

Don't forget that you can also change your mind.  If you declared an Urgency condition and decide that you need more assistance/priority, you can always ""upgrade"" it to a Distress, and vice-versa. </p>

"Is it possible for a modern commercial airliner to stop being tracked without substantial mechanical failure?","15718","","<p>I was speaking to someone about the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370"" rel=""nofollow"">MH370 incident</a>, and they suggested that a hijacker could turn off the device that sends the plane's current position, resulting in the appearance of a catastrophic midair failure.</p>

<p>I assume that such functionality could not be turned off, but I could be wrong. Is there any way that this could be done? Could an aircraft's internal tracking systems be ""turned off"" midair, and also not be located by external tracking like radar?</p>
","<p>The device you are talking about is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_%28aeronautics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">transponder</a>.  This is a device that listens for a signal (an interrogation) and responds with information about the airplane including an ATC assigned code, altitude information and additional aircraft info for certain equipment.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways ATC watches airplanes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_surveillance_radar#Primary_radar"" rel=""nofollow"">Primary Radar</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_surveillance_radar#Secondary_radar"" rel=""nofollow"">Secondary Surveillance Radar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The transponder is interrogated by the Secondary radar and the response is listened for.  Even with no transponder, the aircraft can still be tracked by primary radar.  This is just a normal radar that is good at seeing airplane sized objects and not so great at seeing weather and can occasionally spot a large flock of birds.  The primary radar is what provides the ""blip"" on radar and tracks the airplane.  The datablock ATC has on the airplane comes from the secondary, so what ATC will see is a blip with no information.  Turning off the transponder is as simple as setting it to OFF or pulling a circuit breaker and yes, it can be selected OFF in flight, it is just a switch.</p>

<p>The problem with radar is that it only works so far from a radar transmitter and the further away you are the higher you must be to be seen by the radar.  Over the ocean away from land, you are going to be on the fringe of radar or out of radar contact completely and thus unable to be tracked directly by ATC (at this point, non-radar procedures such as position reporting and ETAs can be used to track positions).  </p>

<p>The flight in question was apparently visible by a military radar before it disappeared from the scopes (it allegedly observed what appeared to be a turn back toward its origin).  </p>

","<p>Stand on its rotor head? yes, maybe. Spin? not for long.</p>

<p>The rotor hub and blades are quite strong and can take the helicopter weight at-least temporarily (leaving aside the balancing issue). The blades are designed to overcome stresses in flapping and can take the load. The rotor hub however, is not designed to take loads in this attitude (it is designed to lift the helicopter, and not push it) and its capability is an open question. You could put the helicopter upside down, but its going to be a brief affair with no guarantee that the parts will ever work again properly.</p>

<p>However, in case you want to spin the helicopter, you run into a number of issues. You could clamp the blades down and try to spin, but the rotor hub will struggle to take the load. The load path from the rotors to the fuselage is designed to take lifting loads and not this. </p>

<p>But first, the dynamic loads- helicopter systems below the rotor hub are not designed to take rotating loads, let alone the horribly unbalanced one like a fuselage. Even the lightweight helicopter blades are balanced to prevent and unsafe vibrations -in a case like this, the rotating fuselage would most likely tear apart the helicopter before anything else.</p>

"What is the main difference between an ETOPS certified and non-ETOPS certified plane?","15640","","<p>ETOPS stands for Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards, a rule which permits twin engine aircraft to fly routes which, at some point, are more than 60 minutes flying time away from the nearest airport suitable for emergency landing.</p>

<p>However, it does not mean that a non-ETOPS plane <em>physically</em> cannot fly an ETOPS route, as American Airlines proved when they <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/13/9320061/american-airlines-accidentally-used-the-wrong-plane-to-fly-to-hawaii"">accidentally used</a> a non-ETOPS certified plane to operate ETOPS-required LAX-HNL route. Everything went well except the cancelled return flight.</p>

<p>So, <strong>what is the difference between an ETOPS certified plane and a non-ETOPS certified plane when they are the same model?</strong></p>
","<p>The FAA ETOPS certification requires a certain standards from<em>both</em> the airline (the operator) and the aircraft (the manufacturer). </p>

<p>As far as the manufacturers are concerned, the ETOPS certification is given for a particular <em>aircraft-engine combination</em> satisfying certain requirements. The <a href=""http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2007_register&amp;position=all&amp;page=1873"" rel=""nofollow"">FAA ETOPS Rules</a> Section A deals with the Airplane-Engine Type Design Approval. According to the document, the type approval involves a two step process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, the FAA determines that airplane systems meet certain design standards for safe operations during an airplane diversion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of these requirements are,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The aircraft should have at least three independent electrical generators.</p></li>
<li><p>Auxiliary Power unit (APU) (when required) can start after the airplane has been cold-soaked for several hours and can run reliably for the remainder of the flight.</p></li>
<li><p>System safety analyses have to show that expected system failures will not prevent safe landing at a diversion airport. </p></li>
<li><p>Systems with time limited capabilities,which typically is cargo fire suppression, need to have the capacity to support a maximum length diversion,
including a 15-minute allowance for a hold or go-around at the diversion
airport</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second part of the approval process is an evaluation of engine in-
  flight shutdowns and other significant airplane system failures that have
  occurred while the airplane-engine combination has been in service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The aircraft-engine combination should have at-least 250,000 engine-hours for evaluation, though this can be reduced with compensating factors. The airplane-engine combination should maintain a target IFSD (In Flight Shut Down, defined as ""When an engine ceases to function (when the airplane is airborne) and is shut down, however briefly, whether self induced, flightcrew initiated or caused by an external influence."") rate at or below 0.02 per 1,000 engine-hours for 180min ETOPS approval.</p>

<p>The manufacturer should also demonstrate that flying with OEI doesn't cause undue stresses to the aircrew and is safe for the airframe.</p>

<p>The ETOPS design approval has to be <em>applied for</em> with FAA and obtained after the relevant processes. Thus, the same aircraft will not have ETOPS approval if the engine is different or even the same aircraft-engine combination won't have ETOPS approval if used by another airline or if no certification was sought.</p>

<p>There is another method of getting ETOPS approval called the 'early' ETOPS approval which </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...takes a systems approach to the development of an airplane and engine. ... an applicant must demonstrate that the design flaws on previously designed airplanes are not present in the new airplane. The applicant must also consider how the maximum length flight and diversion affect the design and function of airplane systems to ensure that they have the capability and reliability for safe ETOPS flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After ETOPS certified, the airplane-engine combination and the operator are under continuous monitoring with the certificate being withdrawn in case of lapses or IFSD goes above the target rate and the manufacturer's corrective action does not eliminate the unsafe condition.</p>

<p>As far as the LAX-Hawaii incident is concerned, according to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/14/american-airlines-wrong-plane-hawaii-flight"" rel=""nofollow"">American Airlines Spokesman</a>, both aircrafts (the 'correct' ETOPS airplane, A321H and the wrong one sent, A321S) had the same configuration, but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two small differences in terms of equipment to allow ETOPS certification. Since you can’t divert for medical [on a Hawaii bound flight], you’re required to carry extra medical oxygen on board and an extra fire suppression canister</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also reports that the (ETOPS certified) A321H <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-airlines-aadvantage-pre-consolidation/1583923-2-class-airbus-a321s-32s-32b-sharklets-service-aug-2014-consolidated.html"" rel=""nofollow"">has extra fuel tanks</a>, which the (non ETOPS certified) A321S didn't have, though the AA spokesperson had said that the fuel tanks and range were the same.</p>

"How does TCAS work?","15569","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCAS"">TCAS</a> is obviously a fantastic piece of kit, but I was wondering: exactly how does it work?</p>

<p>What I mean is, how does it determine whether to tell a pilot to climb or descend when there's traffic?</p>

<p>Also, can you give an overview of the various types of TCAS, and how planes agree a resolution?</p>
","<p>TCAS works by sending interrogations to other aircraft's transponders. The transponder will reply to the interrogation in a similar way it responds to radar. From the time difference between the interrogation and the reply, the distance to the other aircraft is calculated. The reply itself contains the altitude of the other aircraft. </p>

<p>The explanation below gives an insight in the basic working of the TCAS algorithm. In reality it is more complex to deal with all kinds of exceptional situations.</p>

<p>The distance and the altitude difference with the other aircraft is tracked to identify a trend. From successive distance measurements the closure rate is determined. With the closure rate and the current distance (slant range) an approximation is made of the time to the closest point of approach (CPA). This is done by simply dividing the range by the closure rate, the result is called 'range tau'. The same is done in the vertical plane. Dividing the difference in altitude by the vertical speed difference leads to the vertical tau.  </p>

<p>If both tau's are less than certain threshold, a Traffic Alert (TA) is raised. When the tau's are less that another (lower) threshold, a Resolution Advisory is given. The TA is a 'heads up' indication, the RA is an instruction that must be followed by the pilot to reduce the collision risk. 
The threshold times depend on the altitude, ranging from 20 seconds (&lt;1000 ft AGL) to 48 seconds (> FL200) for TA's and from 15 seconds (&lt;2350 ft) to 35 seconds (> FL200) for RA's. Below 1000 ft AGL, RA's are inhibited. </p>

<p>Originally TCAS did only give Traffic Advisories in the form of a ""Traffic, traffic"" annunciation. There was no avoiding action indicated. </p>

<p>With the introduction of TCAS II in the second half of the '80s the Resolution Advisory made its entrance. </p>

<p><strong>RA selection</strong> </p>

<p>In selecting a resolution advisory, there are two basically two steps. The first step is to select a sense, either upward or downward. This is based on a calculation of how much altitude difference can be achieved at the CPA by either starting a climb or descent, assuming the target will maintain its vertical rate. In the calculation the reaction time of the crew and acceleration and climb / descent rate of the aircraft is assumed (5 seconds, 0.25g, 1500 fpm).  </p>

<p>The second step is to select a magnitude. The algorithm is designed to be the least disruptive to the flight path, whilst still achieving a minimum vertical separation.</p>

<p><strong>RA coordination</strong> </p>

<p>When a RA is selected, it is transmitted to the other aircraft. When the other aircraft receives that message, it will only use the opposite sense for its own RA. In the rare case that both aircraft transmit their RA intent at the same time, the aircraft with the higher Mode S address will give in and reverse its RA sense if it is conflicting with the other. </p>

<p><strong>Algorithm versions</strong></p>

<p>Over the years various improvements are made to TCAS II. The initial TCAS II systems had version 6.0 of the algorithm, later replaced by 6.04a in the mid 90's. Further system evaluation lead to the development of version 7.0, implemented from 1999. Following a near mid-air collision in Japan in 2001 and a mid-air collision over Uberlingen, Germany further changes were made leading to version 7.1. </p>

<p>Changes that were made include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the wording of the RA's </li>
<li>logic to limit the vertical path deviations</li>
<li>logic to prevent nuisance alerts in RVSM airspace and on closely spaced parallel runway operations</li>
<li>logic to detect non-compliance to an RA</li>
<li>improved RA sense reversal logic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TCAS &amp; ATC</strong></p>

<p>TCAS RA's take precedence of ATC instructions. The fact that one of the two aircraft followed ATC instructions, and the other TCAS RA's contributed to the Uberlingen accident. 
In case a pilot is getting a TCAS RA he should notify ATC. </p>

"What is the ""optimal"" age of a fighter pilot?","15533","","<p>Fighter pilots are always portrayed as young, fit men (and woman), in their 20s and 30s - and most of the F16 pilots I know are that age.</p>

<p>However, today someone, who is over 50 years old, mentioned that he was asked to be an F22 pilot.  His background is astonishing, flying in multiple ""wars,"" and he was even the commander of the Thunderbirds in F-16s for a while.   </p>

<p>Even though this man clearly has the background of the stereotypical F22 pilot, would age be a problem?  Wouldn't someone whose body could take more abuse be better suited for that type of assignment?</p>
","<p>It depends on what you mean by ""optimal"".</p>

<p>For a dogfight, the optimal age is probably 30. At this age a person has lots of experience, but still maintains their full mental agility, ability to calculate and energy. In a dogfight your ability to think fast and calculate your next move is the critical factor.</p>

<p>For combat missions, however, 40-45 may be more optimal, because experience, judgement and knowledge becomes more important. Knowing when to attack, how to attack, how to make your approach, how to do your mission setup, and many other things become the product of long experience. For complicated missions in enemy territory, it is better to have someone with long experience, rather than a young hotshot.</p>

<p>Once a person hits about 60-65 years in age, their mental ability to calculate declines significantly. Nevertheless, experience can make up for it in some instances. For example, at age 63 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Smyslov"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vassily Smyslov</a> was a candidate for the world chess championship, an amazing accomplishment for a person of that age. Emanuel Lasker took 3rd place at Moscow 1935, a premier chess tournament, at the age of 66, which was practically a miracle. These are exceptions, however. In general, once a person gets into their 60s, their mental ability deteriorates. Therefore, the age 50-55 can be considered the maximum age at which experience and judgement can be used effectively in high speed combat situations.</p>

<p><strong>Complex Mission Role</strong></p>

<p>To investigate my basic assertion that optimal age for a combat mission (not air supremacy) pilot is 40-45 I investigated pilot astronauts. Since astronauts are selected from large numbers of candidates and have short careers typically, it is a safe assumption that their average age is what NASA considers to be ideal. According to <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19930020135"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA Technical Report 1304</a> the mean age for all selected pilot candidates is 39.90 years old. If we assume a pilot has a 5-year career, then my guess for optimal age matches perfectly with NASA's selection choices. This may be considered strong evidence that for a pilot executing complex missions, the optimal age range is, indeed, 40 to 45 years.</p>

<p><strong>Air Supremacy Role (""dog fighting"")</strong></p>

<p>To determine the optimal age for air supremacy (""dog fighting""), if we had access to the USAF's (or other country's) exercise data over time, we might get an idea since we could calculate an ELO rating for each combatant and identify to the top exercise fighters of all time. Unfortunately this kind of data is not released as far as I know, probably because the armed services do like naming or identifying particular soldiers. I do strongly suspect, though, that if such a study was done it would show the ""best in the world"" air supremacy pilots would be clustered around the age of 30. To check this, I tried summarizing statistics from WW2 German fighter pilots. Using birth data on 470 German aces I generated the following plot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NHyaK.png"" alt=""fighter pilot stats""></p>

<p>In this chart, the bar chart is the total number of aces grouped by date of birth. The blue dots are the average number of victories for that birth year group. What this chart seems to show is that performance is remarkably consistent between the ages of 18 and 32, with a slight advantage to the younger pilots, but then declines significantly. The 1922 group was significantly skewed by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Hartmann"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Erich Hartmann</a>. If we eliminate him as an outlier, the top group is the class of 1920 which would have been between the ages of 19 and 25 during the war. This seems to show my original guess was wrong, and that dogfighting is dependent more on quick reflexes and fast thinking than on experience, which hands the edge to the young.</p>

If you want more info on the benefits of an inverted V-tail, make sure you read KeithS's answer, too.</p>

<p>In the Global Hawk the V-tail was chosen to mount the engine above the fuselage for better IR shielding from below. The two tail surfaces also shield the exhaust from the side without affecting aerodynamics negatively.</p>

<p>The Aerosonde configuration was chosen after Tad McGeer had experienced in 1990 from the 1/5th scale RC model of the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/12413/uav-project-in-aerospace-department/12415#12415"">Perseus UAV</a> of <a href=""http://www.aurora.aero"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aurora</a> that a tail-mounted propeller would stabilize the aircraft to the point that it became practically uncontrollable. A <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3306/why-are-push-propellers-so-rare-yet-they-are-still-around/3320#3320"">pusher propeller is more efficient</a> than a tractor propeller, which also explains the propeller location on the Predator.</p>

<p>If it strikes you how many of the UAVs have V-tails: This allows to use fewer components (surfaces, connectors, actuators), and since all are moved by computer control, the issue of a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3741/how-do-the-beech-bonanzas-ruddervators-work/3744#3744"">mechanical mixer</a> does not exist.

The lower maneuverability possible with V-tails is also not an issue - reconnaissance UAVs fly mostly straight and level.</p>

<p>The high aspect ratio wings are helping in extending the range and especially the flying time of observation drones. Similar to glider wings, the long and slender wing will offer the lowest drag for a given lift at subsonic speed.</p>

<p>In the end, each detail has been chosen deliberately and can be well explained. There is no conspiracy to make UAVs look different from Cessnas.</p>

If you fly in an older aircraft it looks worn out and it is susceptible to stains etc. Why do they not use one of the hard flooring options like linoleum?</p>
","<h2>The answer: High heels!</h2>

<p>The <a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JackGreen.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">local pressure of high heels</a> would punch a hole in the aluminium or composite flooring, and a carpet is the lightest way to distribute the loads such that the local pressure from high heels can be tolerated. <strong>This</strong> is the real reason.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the floor of the fuselage also very high localized loads can occur,

</blockquote>

<p>Other reasons are improved noise absorption and damping of vibrations. Nobody likes it when the floor panels start to resonate when excited by  some engine or pump frequency.</p>

<p>With composite panels now in widespread use for cabin interiors, manufacturing flaws need to be covered, and carpets serve this purpose well. From <a href=""http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/advanced-materials-for-aircraft-interiors"" rel=""noreferrer"">Compositesworld.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because sandwich panel facesheets are very thin, core print-through is
  common. Further, pinholes can form as phenolic resins outgas during

  are surfaced with some type of decorative material to cover surface
  flaws. Floor panels can be painted or covered with flame-retardant

"Why don't black boxes have their own GPS?","15422","","<p>In too many cases of unfortunate incidents, hunting for FDR (or CVR also) is a major challenge.<sup>1</sup> There are many or all answers recorded on that device.</p>

<p>Why a locator (GPS linked) cannot be included in the black box? It has its battery which runs for several days and very rigid outer shell.</p>

<p>Ordinary cell phones are GPS enabled which pinpoint their location with the accuracy of a couple of feet. So why there cannot be a more sophisticated technology added to the black boxes?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>: <em>I am aware that most of FDRs/CVRs are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unrecovered_flight_recorders"" rel=""nofollow"">eventually recovered</a>.</em></p>
","<p>First let's and define what ""too many cases"" means in terms of cold, hard, unfeeling numbers (as best we can):</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unrecovered_flight_recorders"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia has a list (admittedly incomplete) of crashes where the CVR/FDR was not recovered</a>. There are 16 crashes listed. I'll further add Air France 447 (which took ""a long time"" to find), and MH370 (which is currently unrecovered), bringing the total to 18.  </p>

<p>As Wikipedia admits their list is incomplete I'll double-and-round that in the name of being pessimistically conservative and say that since 1965 there have been 50 cases where it has taken ""a long time"" to recover the flight recorders (or they were never recovered). </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents#Aircraft_Crashes_Record_Office_.28ACRO.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In a single year there can be over 100 ""incidents""</a>. Even if we assume the CVR/FDR data wouldn't be useful for all of them there are still many hundreds (if not thousands) of incidents since 1965 where the cockpit voice recorder and/or flight data recorders have been recovered along with other wreckage or damaged airframes - often within a matter of days or hours (as soon as investigators can <em>get to the wreckage</em>). That's a pretty good track record.</p>

<p>One could certainly argue (legitimately) that ""one unrecovered flight recorder is too many"", and indeed the goal is to always find the recorders and analyze their contents.<br>
If we're being realistic about this though we're going to have to accept the fact that <em>sometimes you're just not going to recover the recorders</em>: Aircraft crashes are messy, high-energy affairs and often involve inhospitable recovery environments like ""the bottom of the ocean"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone has better statistics close at hand I would love to review them and update this answer. Otherwise, it should be obvious that the above is an <em>extremely</em> rough off-the-cuff estimate, and should not be taken for any research or investigative purposes.<br>
  In case it's not obvious - well I just said it.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Now, to the meat of your question:</p>

<p>Theoretically you <em>could</em> include a locator beacon in the CVR or FDR - incorporating a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_radiobeacon#Digital_mode:_406.C2.A0MHz_beacons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">406MHz ELT</a> into the black box design is possible (you could even add a GPS to encode the device's location, though it would be of limited additional value with the inherent location accuracy of the 406MHz locator signal and satellite search system).</p>

<p><strong>So why don't we do it?</strong></p>

<p>As <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/2657/64"">Lnafziger pointed out</a>, airliners are already required to carry emergency locator transmitters - in any case where such a beacon would function including one in the CVR/FDR would be redundant with existing equipment in the aircraft.</p>

<p>Further practical problems arise when you consider <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_data_recorder#Design"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the kind of abuse a ""black box"" is subject to</a> -- These things need to survive a crash (up to 3400 Gs), crush forces, fire, and immersion in water under pressure.<br>
Your typical distress beacon requires an antenna and a view of the sky, both of which would be in serious doubt after a crash:  The black box may be inside or under wreckage, required external antennas may have been torn off or burned away, and distress beacon signals are unlikely to be received if the recorder is under water (this is why current generation recorders have sonar ""pingers"" to assist in locating them).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To easily illustrate the sort of problem radio devices have with ""stuff"" between them and the sky, try this experiment: Take your cell phone, wrap it in aluminum foil to simulate the skin of a plane, put it in a zip-lock bag, and take it to the bottom of a pool. I bet you won't be able to get a call on that phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Given the numerous failure modes (all of which are fairly high-probability in a real-world crash scenario), and the fact that we <em>usually</em> have a pretty good idea of where an aircraft is when a crash does happen, there isn't much to be gained by including additional locator technology in the CVR/FDR designs at this time - it just adds more components that would need periodic testing and recertification to ensure they are functioning properly and would activate appropriately in the event of a crash, while not appreciably improving our odds of finding the recorders.</p>

"What's the advantage of the F4U Corsair's gull wing design?","15271","","<p>What is the advantage of the F4U Corsair's gull wing design?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B7rMQ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B7rMQ.jpg"" alt=""F4U CORSAIR""></a></p>

<p>Is there also a disadvantage to this? The wing design just seems odd, and as far as I know it is one of the only planes to use this design.</p>

<p>Is this because the technology advanced so fast, or because the wing design was flawed?</p>
","<p>The wing shape in the F4U Corsair is called the inverted gull wing. The main reasons for use of this is the large propeller used in the aircraft.</p>

<p>The Corsair design was in response to the US Navy RFP (Request for Proposal) in 1938, which mandated the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should have maximum attainable speed</li>
<li>The stall speed should be 70 mph</li>
<li>Minimum range of 1000 miles</li>
<li>Bombs should be carried under the wing (this was supposed to be dropped on aircraft formations from above, which didn't work out)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to achieve this, the Vought engineers used the largest available engine, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-2800_Double_Wasp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prat and Whitney R2800 Double Wasp</a> radial engine (this was done as the Navy, in a change of heart, vowed to consider designs with liquid-cooled engines, in contradiction with a policy settled in 1927 that required air-cooled engines for shipboard aircraft). Also, the wing area of F4U was the largest naval aircraft of its time.</p>

<p>During design, the oil cooler and supercharger inlets were moved to wing leading edges. In order to extract power from the engine, a large (~4m dia) propeller was chosen. This large propeller caused problems with ground clearance, which necessitated an increase in the landing gear length.</p>

<p>The Vought team overcame this by choosing an inverted gull wing, which starts out with a strong anhedral, and then curved upwards to strong dihedral, with landing gear at the lowest point in the bend. </p>

<li>Shortened landing gear</li>
<li>Elimination of the need for wing fillets, and reducing drag as the wing and fuselage were perpendicular.</li>
<li>Simplified wing folding (the wings were folded at the lowest point), with the folded wings nearly at the height of the propellers. This enabled simple automatic mechanism for folding/unfolding, unlike the F6F Sto-wing which was manual, as the hydraulic mechanism added too much weight.</li>

<p><strong>Steel</strong> is used in components where strength or part life is most important, like landing gear and other important structural elements, as well as many fasteners. <strong>Titanium</strong> is used where weight and high temperature are important, such as around the engines. <strong>Composites</strong> are traditionally used for many less-structural applications such as panels and fairings, but may also be used in the empennage (tail surfaces) or on the interior as floor beams. <strong>Other</strong> materials will include alloys like nickel, as well as specialty materials like rubber, plastic, and fabric, which are used mostly in the cabin.</p>

"Why are pilots deemed unfit to fly after emergency ejection?","15247","","<p>There are many instances where pilots need to eject out of the cockpit due to emergency situations, and after such an ejection from some modern aircraft, pilots are deemed unfit to fly airplanes for some years. Why is this done? What is the minimum number of years after which a pilot is deemed fit to fly again?</p>
","<p>Ejection Seats are not a free ticket out. They are incredibly violent and rough on your body. This newspaper article has a more chilling quote from an interview: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About <strong>one in three will get a spinal facture</strong>, due to the force when the seat is ejected - the gravitational force is 14 to 16 times normal gravity and it might be applied at 200G per second. Bruising and abrasions are typical from the shock of the chute opening or the air blast. In the early days, there were cases where pilots would eject into very-high-speed air and it would whip their arms behind and break them, pop their shoulders out; same thing could happen to the legs. <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/how-dangerous-is-it-to-eject-from-a-fighter-jet-20120730-239mp.html"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, it is very possible to get back pains and a host of other problems as a result of ejecting. Since these type of things are not that easily reversible, you'd rather take the safe path and remove then from the cockpit than put then back in a work environment that known is pretty hard on your body. Aircrew seem to agree:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was the most violent thing I’ve ever felt in my life,” says one of the B-1 crew members, whom the Air Force asked me to identify as “Captain IROC.” “I lost a full inch in height,” because his spine absorbed such tremendous G-forces. <a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/how-things-work-ejection-seats-29088450/#eVsKyTAhpzQS7pBE.99"">Source</a></p>

<p>Modern ejection seats are however increasingly intelligent and will gauge the ejection force applied to the conditions, cutting down the number of serious cases. </p>

<p>This <a href=""http://emj.bmj.com/content/17/5/371.full"">paper</a> discusses the symptoms of four individuals who crashed their jets in mid-air. The medical problems encountered with ejection can be classified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Injuries from the emergency that causes ejection—fire or collision.</li>
  <li>Canopy jettison: burns from “MDC splatter” and cuts from fragmented plastic. For these reasons, aircrew are always advised to wear their visors down, to protect the face.</li>
  <li>Firing of ejection gun: spinal injuries.</li>
  <li>Entering airflow: wind blast may cause lung damage; seat tumbles at variable speed, which may be as high as 180 rpm. (All seats have a drogue parachute or deployable aerodynamic panels to prevent tumbling); flail injuries to extremities.</li>
  <li>Parachute deployment: snatch injuries.</li>
  <li>Landing: lower limb injuries.</li>

"What is a vortex generator?","15190","","<p>I saw a vortex generator mentioned in an aircraft listing.</p>

<p>What is a vortex generator?</p>
","<p>To be more general, a vortex generator is a small angled plate installed on an outer surface of an aerodynamic body. The angle of the plate causes the air to swirl, creating a vortex behind it. This effect allows the air flow to remain ""attached"" to the surface even at points where the flow without a vortex would separate from the surface.</p>

<p>One of the most common uses of vortex generators is on aircraft wings forward of the ailerons. When the aircraft wing <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/6366/1696"">stalls</a>, the flow detaches from the wings. This means that the flow will detach before it reaches the ailerons, making them ineffective. The use of vortex generators helps the ailerons to provide control even if the rest of the wing is stalled.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w74Gh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>What are the advantages/disadvantages of these engines and why are they not more common?</p>
","<h1>Advantages</h1>

<ol>
<li>Compression-ignition engines have higher compression ratio which leads to being more efficient. So the aircraft range improves and on longer flights payload capacity may improve as well. Fuel consumption is usually about 30% lower.</li>
<li>The higher efficiency combined with the fact that Jet-A fuel is cheaper mean they have lower operating cost. Especially since in Europe the leaded avgas is heavily taxed to discourage it's use for environmental concerns.</li>
<li>They should be a bit more reliable. A diesel engine needs high pressure fuel pump, but apparently there are less problems with those than there are with spark-plugs.</li>
<li>They are somewhat easier to operate, since they don't have separate throttle and mixture controls.</li>
<li>They don't suffer the problems associated with incorrect settings of those controls, namely knocking/detonation and pre-ignition.</li>
<li>Turbo-charging them does not carry the risk of pre-ignition and most of them are turbo-charged, so the performance does not decline as fast with density altitude.</li>
<li>There is lower risk of fire since jet/diesel fuel is less flammable (has higher ignition temperature).</li>
<li>Jet-A has much wider availability, especially in the third world, so it's easier to plan for fuel stops on a flight through say, Latin America or Africa</li>
</ol>

<h1>Disadvantages</h1>

<ol>
<li>They are heavier for the same power, because they need to be made from stronger material due to the higher compression ratio and because they need to have larger cylinder volume because of lower maximal rpm. On longer flights the reduction in fuel weight often makes up for the heavier engine.</li>
<li>Turbo-charging comes with specific operating procedures unfamiliar to those used to normally aspirated engines and a slight lag in thrust lever (it's not a throttle) response.</li>
<li>As others mentioned, small airports may not have jet fuel yet. This is probably better in Europe where the pressure to phase out 100LL avgas is stronger. Some engines also use automobile diesel fuel or even either jet or diesel fuel as diesel engines are less picky about what they burn.</li>

<p>Now granted these are completely different aircraft. What I'm wondering, is why one aircraft can remain so useful for so long, while others quickly become obsolete. </p>
","<p>Three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The B-52 stayed useful by taking on ""easier"" roles as it aged.</p>

<ul>
<li>It actually started life as a high-performance penetrator, relying on speed and altitude to stay safe. Think Early Cold War, shortly after WWII.</li>
<li>When ground-launched missiles improved, the B-52 was forced into flying low-altitude penetration underneath radars (a role for which it was NOT designed and rapidly wore out the airframe) accompanied by a host of other aircraft to protect it and help it penetrate defenses. Despite their escorts, we lost low-dozens of B-52s in Vietnam.</li>
<li>Later in the Cold War, the B-52 was completely outmatched by air defenses (fighters, SAMs, etc), and had little hope of penetrating defenses (at either low or high altitude) to drop nuclear bombs.

You can't bomb your targets until the air defenses have <em>already</em> been defeated---after the ""first week"" of a war, the most critical phase, when you need them the most. In other words, the B-52 (and B-1) are relatively easy to shoot down, so they're not nearly as useful as they used to be. You can't fly them unless many of the toughest enemies are already dead. So you can't use them as often as you want.</li>
<li>@MSalters phrased it quite nicely: the reason the B-52 (and B-1) hasn't changed is because other aircraft are doing the hard work for them (tearing down enemy defenses), and such aircraft have advanced <em>immensely</em>. But that amount of support is quite resource intensive, so if you wanted to fly B-52s in the ""first week"" when enemy defenses are still effective, you'll need a lot of help:<br><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGbs8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGbs8.png"" alt=""value of stealth""></a><br> <sup>(Image source: <a href=""https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AFA/def574d3-a429-454b-a3e8-e5073c93ca6b/UploadedImages/MI%20DD%20Bomber%20final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beyond the ""Bomber"": The New Long-Range Sensor-Shooter Aircraft and United States National Security</a> - Lieutenant General David A.

<li><p>We didn't build enough B-1s and B-2s to replace it, so we kept some B-52s to fill in the gaps (we don't have any other suitable heavy bombers in inventory, this is the <em>only</em> choice).</p>

<ul>
<li>The 100 B-1Bs were just a stopgap until the B-2 showed up, of which we meant to build 132 (cut to 21 airframes). Had the Cold War continued, the B-2 would have comprised the bulk of today's bomber force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We were busy buying new fighters and cargo planes.</p>

<ul>
<li>The official, stated goal is to recapitalize the entire bomber fleet (less the B-2) because it's increasingly obsolete. That's worth repeating: <em>the B-1 and B-52 are near obsolete</em>. They're not nearly capable enough. The next bomber isn't another B-1, B-52, or modded 747 because we don't want to maintain the <em>same</em> capabilities. We want <em>more</em> capability--much more--than what we currently have. We've only waited this long because <a href=""http://www.northropgrumman.com/AboutUs/AnalysisCenter/Documents/pdfs/The_2018_Bomber_the_case_for_a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replacing the airlift and fighter fleets took priority</a>.</li>
<li>The LRS-B (new stealth bomber; formerly NGLRS) will replace the B-52 starting around next decade. The contract is expected to be awarded very soon. The Pentagon <a href=""http://www.defensenews.com/story/breaking-news/2015/09/02/new-air-force-bomber-testing-stealth-wind-test/71572050/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">briefed a select group earlier this month</a>. Looks very promising---well managed, on budget, very capable, and surprisingly mature. 

<ul>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The B-21 (ex-LRS-B, ex-NGLRS) was indeed awarded 27 Oct 2015, a month and a half after this post was originally written. Very little is known, but it is indeed a stealthy bomber (the official render closely resembles the outer mold line of early B-2 iterations before the redesign). And it is indeed on time and under budget by ~9% (APUC = <a href=""http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/626131/air-force-awards-lrs-b-contract/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">\$511M</a> vs. the \$550M requirement, FY10\$).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In short, we still fly the B-52 today because we don't have a choice, not because we want to.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Parting thoughts</strong>: </p>

<p>I want to emphasize that the B-52 did <em>not</em> remain effective in its intended role (penetrating the USSR on Day 1), upgrades notwithstanding. </p>

<p>Yes, the B-52 survived multiple replacements (eg XB-70, B-1A), but not because it was more capable (it wasn't; the B-70/1A went higher/faster/lower/with more payload), but because those potential replacements couldn't outpace Soviet defenses <em>either</em> and so were cancelled in favor of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles... except the B-2, which <em>could</em> outpace Soviet defenses but was curtailed when those Soviet defenses disappeared. The B-52 survived basically because of luck: against the XB-70 and B-1A, it was the incumbent, already bought and paid for; against the B-2, history smiled.</p>

<p>Also, the B-52 did not ""survive"" the B-1B. The B-1B was never meant to replace all B-52s in the first place. The B-1B was meant to fill an urgent requirement as a stopgap from ~1985-1995 until the B-2 could enter service. Unlike previous B-52 would-be replacements, B-1B production was not cut short: 100 were ordered, and all 100 were delivered, essentially on time and on budget (<a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/notes/N3616.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">though that was actually partly the problem</a>).</p>

<p>Thankfully the B-52's range and payload kept it productive during its long service.</p>

"What happens if a parachute does not open while skydiving?","14956","","<p>While skydiving we have to jump from the airplane at a certain altitude above Earth. So if for some reason the parachute doesn't open, then will that person (or any object similar to a human body) fall to Earth or will it be incinerated/vanish in the sky due to air-friction in space before coming down to the Earth?</p>
","<p>The majority of the heat developed during reentry of a space-vehicle comes from air compression not friction. Remember, to go into space, you don't have to go very high, but to orbit you will have to <a href=""http://what-if.xkcd.com/58/"">go very <em>very</em> fast</a>, and it's not the fall that produces the heat, it's the slowing down part.</p>

<p>If you had a human fall without a chute, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity"">terminal velocity</a> (where air resistance cancels gravity and you continue downward at a constant speed) would be around 100-200 mph, not nearly enough to cause any kind of heat (or cars would burn up by going normal cruising speeds). To get higher terminal velocities, you'd have to go a lot higher, where the air is a lot less dense, higher than any skydiver have, and as far as I can tell <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Baumgartner"">Felix Baumgartner</a> did not experience any incineration during his jump.</p>

"Is there a website similar to FlightRadar24, but showing general aviation?","14930","","<p>As far as I am concerned, FlightRadar24 reads out transponder responses.</p>

<p>As most engine driven aircrafts have at least a mode C transponder, is there a site that displays such traffic as well?</p>
","<p>Yes, and no.<br>
FlightAware (and I believe FlightRadar24) will show General Aviation aircraft (I panned around a bit and found <code>N802AF</code>, a Pilatus, buzzing around over Bethlehem, Pennsylvania just now).</p>

<p>The catch is most of these systems are fed with ATC data, and generally only pick up flights that are either on an instrument flight plan, or which have picked up flight following &amp; been entered into the ATC system by the controller who set up the strip.  </p>

<p>Most light GA aircraft are flying around VFR (transponder code 1200), and don't show up on these flight tracking sites. Similarly if you're assigned a ""local"" transponder code rather than a system-wide one  you typically won't show up on the tracking sites either (this is often the case when you're flying VFR and go through Approach/Departure for Class C or Class B transitions/arrivals).</p>

<hr>

<p>As more of the fleet is equipped with ADS-B this coverage may improve, as anyone can set up an ADS-B receiver and skim the traffic data. That data is currently only broadcast when a ""participating aircraft"" (ADS-B <em>Out</em> equipped) is in the area though...</p>

<p>Is there something I should do about it? Or do I assume somebody in ATC has seen it?</p>

<p>Is there anything anyone should do in similar circumstances?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3DF3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3DF3.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>
","<p>Really there's nothing you should do in cases like these.</p>

<p>Flightradar24, FlightAware, and similar services should not be used for flight safety purposes, and most of them specifically state so in their terms of service (such as sections 12 and 14 of <a href=""http://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"">Flightradar24's terms and conditions</a>). Their sources may go down for whatever reason -- that does not mean that the plane has crashed.  </p>

<p>These services can only track what ATC controllers can (for the most part), so it's more likely that if there is a real issue, that they'd notice without the general public making a fuss.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this specific case the flight was being tracked using <code>MLAT</code> (designated by the radar type <code>T-MLAT</code>, which is shown in your animated image file). MLAT flight track accuracy relies on the accuracy and number of the receivers in the area, and according to Flightradar24's website, MLAT generally <a href=""http://www.flightradar24.com/how-it-works"">only works above 10000 feet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>MLAT</h3>
  
  <p>In some regions with coverage from several FR24-receivers we also
  calculate positions of aircraft with the help of Multilateration
  (MLAT), by using a method known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA).
  By measuring the difference in time to receive the signal from
  aircraft with an older ModeS-transponder, it's possible to calculate
  the position of these aircraft. Four FR24-receivers or more, receiving
  signals from the same aircraft, are needed to make MLAT work. That
  means that MLAT coverage can only be achieved above about 10000-20000
  feet as the probability that signal can be received by four or more
  receivers increases with increased altitude.</p>
  
  <p>MLAT coverage is today limited to some parts of Europe and North
  America, but expanding fast.</p>

<p>So as the aircraft descends below 10,000 feet there is an increasing chance that you will lose it on Flightradar24's tracking system.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UBEMX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>What's the point of escorting the flight while it has been threatened by a passenger? How do they help to eliminate the threat?</p>
","<p>Fighter jets escorting planes after various sorts of emergencies seems to be standard procedure in many countries, you hear about it quite frequently. It's sometimes implied in the media that if the situation would turn into a 9/11-type hijacking it might be necessary to shoot the plane down but nobody seems willing to fully clarify who could take such a decision and under what conditions on the record.</p>

<p>Now, in most cases, there isn't even a suggestion that a hijacking is happening but it's difficult to determine that in a timely manner and there are still two things fighters can do in other cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a visual confirmation of the situation aboard the plane (Is the plane damaged? The cockpit windows obscured? Who is in the cockpit?)</li>
<li>“Guide” a pilot who has lost communication to an airport.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, one factor is that being able to scramble jets is often seen as a basic requirement to assert sovereignty (witness the mini-controversy in Switzerland when it was revealed that the air force could not do it at certain times of the day) so politically it seems difficult to entirely give up on it, even if it could be argued that it's a waste of money for smaller countries to maintain an air force that does very little beside this type of missions.</p>

"What exactly are the functions of an aviation headset?","14813","","<p>All I know from Google searching is that they provide hearing protection and ATC communication maybe? Do pilots have to attach them or are they wireless? Who can the pilot reach using them?  How much hearing protection does a pilot need? For instance, how does a pilot figure out how many decibels of protection is needed say for a Cessna 172? Must headsets always be worn? I'm interested in knowing all aspects of the uses of an aviation headset.</p>
","<p>Aviation headsets are just like gaming headsets on a computer or console gaming system, except they are sturdier and much more expensive.</p>

<p>At the basic end of the spectrum, an aviation headset is just a big clamp style pair of around the ear headphones with a microphone.  The cable from the headset has 2 plugs (for airplanes) or one plug (for helicopters).  These two plug styles are equivalent electronically, with the helicopter cable having an extra conductor in order to include the microphone and headphones in the same plug. The two-plug variant has one plug for the headphones and one of the microphone.  These differ from gaming headsets in that the headphone plug is 0.25"" (the kind a nice stereo receiver uses) and the microphone plug is 0.206"".  This difference in sizes is to avoid mixing up which plug goes in which jack.</p>

<p>Aviation headsets fall into two broad categories: passive noise reduction and active noise reduction (ANR).  The passive noise reduction headsets rely on a good seal around the ear and a strong clamping force (e.g. David Clarks).  Active noise reduction are somewhat less ""clampy"" and provide less passive protection but make up for this with the active protection.  An ANR headset is money well spent, but these do top out at around \$850-\$1000 for the top models from Lightspeed and Bose respectively.  ANR headsets must be powered to work properly but all ANR headsets still function without power as passive noise reducing headsets.  Power for an ANR headset can come from a battery box or from aircraft power but not interchangeably.  Aircraft power requires panel installation of a plug specific to the headset brand (a single connector provides power, headphone and microphone connections).  In general, unless you happen to own an airplane and install the power plug, you should get the battery version of a headset.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of these headsets is to reduce the noise in the cockpit (they can be very loud) in order to avoid hearing loss (yes, it is that loud) and to facilitate clearer communication with ATC.  </p>

<p>For quieter airplanes there are in-ear headsets that have more in common with earbuds than the bigger headsets.  Some of these are just earplugs wired for sound and some use molds of your ear to provide the seal.  </p>

<hr>

<p>The headset is connected to the airplanes audio panel.  Audio panels vary in complexity but their basic job is to provide an intercom for communication between occupants of the airplane and access to the com radio for communication with ATC.  The audio panel is also able to monitor (listen) the navigation radios certain types of beacons.  In transport aircraft the audio panel is also tied into the passenger address system and the flight attendant's phones in the cabin.</p>

<p>The headsets can be operated in a hot mic setup or the mic can be explicitly turned on and off.  The hot mic is the usual method and the audio panel provides a squelch control so you aren't broadcasting the cockpit noise when not talking.  The ATC transmissions are via a push-to-talk (PTT) switch.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Aviation headsets for the most part do not need to be approved to use in airplanes, but in some situations for US registered aircraft, the requirement of an approved headset can be mandated (some (all?) 121 carriers).  The FAA standards for approval are specified in TSO C-57a and C-58a.  You'll find many, but certainly not all, aviation headsets conform to these orders.  They define minimum performance characteristics of the electronics, speakers, microphones, etc that make up the headset.</p>

<hr>

<p>How much hearing protection is needed depends greatly on the specific airplane in question.  Jets can be on the very loud end of the spectrum (EMB-145) or they can be quiet enough that even passive noise reduction is largely unnecessary.  For the noisy end of the spectrum peak wavelengths can be well in excess of 100 dB.  I can find reports of 130 db in some smaller airplanes and reports of 84 db in a 737 during cruise, but these numbers are all anecdotal in nature.  What is important to take from these is not the specific numbers but that they are high enough to cause hearing loss during prolonged exposure.  The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders defines 85 dB as the threshold for hearing damage from long or repeated exposure. </p>

<p>Passive headsets generally advertise noise reduction around 20 dB (23 dB for the venerable David Clarks) and some people will wear earplugs under a headset to further increase the passive noise reduction. A cursory look at ANR headsets reveal that they tend not to advertise their performance and instead specify maximum ambient noise levels for ANR to properly function (around 120-125 dB for Bose and Lightspeed headsets).  I can personally add an anecdote that both the Lightspeed Zulu and Bose X make dramatic changes in noise level (both of these headsets are now outdated and replaced by newer versions).  </p>

<p>For most smaller airplanes you will wear the headset from startup to shutdown.  As you get into the large jets I have observed crews that wear minimal headsets during takeoff and landing, but not always during cruise.  These airplanes were quiet enough that they were not needed.  On turboprops and smaller jets that I have been in, headsets were worn throughout the flight.  </p>

<hr>

<p>On newer ANR headsets in particular you will find some extra features beyond just being a pair of headphones and a microphone.  These extras include a 3.5 mm auxiliary jack to connect external music and bluetooth to connect your phone or other device to the headset.  These typically come with circuitry to automatically mute or greatly decrease the volume of these inputs when ATC is transmitting.   </p>

","<p>It isn't a black and white issue of who has higher authority.  A pilot in command (PIC) is the ultimate authority for the safe operation of his airplane.  An air traffic controller is the authority for the block of airspace or pavement he controls.  </p>

<p>When you are operating under ATC, it is your responsibility to comply with their instructions as long as they fall within the regulations, they are safe and you are able to comply,  If ATC issues an instruction contrary to regulation or something that would compromise safety, that is when you exercise your PIC authority to deviate from their instruction.  If you are unable to comply, you exercise your authority to deviate and explain why you are deviating.  When you cannot comply with an ATC instruction, for whatever reason, it is the job of ATC to accommodate your and move other airplanes out of your way.</p>

<p>The regulatory basis for the PIC authority and ability to deviate from ATC instructions is in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10#14:2.0.1.3.10.1.4.2"">14 CFR 91.3</a></p>

<p>Absent an emergency, an urgent need* or an inability to comply with ATC, a pilot is required to obey an ATC clearance.  Given this relationship and its exceptions, its is hard to quantify who has a ""higher"" authority.  Both are the ultimate authorities of their domains, but who overrules who is dependent on the situation.  In general however, ATC will be issuing proper clearances that a pilot is bound by regulation to follow, though the pilot must exercise his authority to execute that instruction in a safe manner.</p>

<p>*Urgent needs include things like TCAS RA events and things like weather deviations.  In most cases ATC will help you out with a deviation, but if a controller refuses to allow a deviation, I would happily exercise my PIC authority to safely operate my airplane and turn left/right a few degrees rather than penetrate a thunderstorm updraft.  </p>

<hr>

<p>In the particular case above, the audio exchange between DL2422 and Atlanta ground is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: Good morning Atlanta ground, delta 2422 approaching 3 South taxi Quebec</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DL2422 is at the southern exit of ramp 3 and requesting taxi with ATIS information Q.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Delta 2422, behind the MD88 from your right, runway 27R, taxi via Mike and hold short of Dixie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ATC has instructed DL2422 to let an MD88 pass from right to left, to taxi on taxiway M to runway 27R but to hold short for taxiway D (in ATL D is ""Dixie"" due to the larger number of ""Delta"" airplanes).  To follow this instruction, an airplane should taxi south from spot 3S on taxiway L5, cross L and then turn left on M, then taxi on M, stopping short of D and awaiting further instruction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: OK behind the 88 from the right, 27R Mike short of Dixie, DL2422</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, DL2422 acknowledges this correctly.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ground</strong>: DL2422 they won't let you go to Charlotte until 57 minutes after the hour, time now 29 after</p>
  
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: OK copy 57, DL2422</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DL2422 has been issued a wheels-up time, but their taxi clearance has not been amended.  They are still cleared to taxi via M short of D.  Sequencing to meet this time will happen east of D in further clearances.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ground</strong>: DL2422, you are supposed to be on M  </p>
  
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: Yes sir, we're going out there right now.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Looks like you joined L  </p>
  
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: You know what, we'll taxi out there any way we want unless you tell us to, I don't like your attitude.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Ground</strong>: I don't have an attitude sir, I'm just saying it looks like you joined L instead of M and I'm just trying to correct you before you stay on L.</p>
  
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: Ok, cause my god, there's another plane out there, its like 6 miles away.  Your attitude is really something sir, we're out here on M. Good morning.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Good morning.  There was no attitude, I was just trying to correct you, that's my job to correct you if you mess up.  I'm just trying to make sure everyone is doing what I ask them for certain reasons.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>DL2422</strong>: You make a mistake every 2-3 minutes, but my attitude is not like yours, we're out on M and you didn't tell us how to get there so next time you can try doing that.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DL captain is making a scene and a very roundabout argument that the taxi route did not specify how he was supposed to transition from spot 3S to taxiway M.  I agree that this is the case, but do not understand why any assumption would be made other than to taxi straight out and turn left on M.  </p>

<p>This is a good example of a minor deviation that had DL2422 just turned right and then left and said ""oops, fixing that, joining M, thanks!"", then that would have been the end of it.  This captain's unprofessional display will instead net him disciplinary action and classify his deviation as ""willful"" rather than ""accidental"".  </p>

<p>For a clearer visualization of the event, see this image:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zfor.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zfor.png"" alt=""ATL""></a><br>
In this image, the green circle is the starting point of DL2422 and the blue line is the cleared taxi route with the assumed transition to M via L5.  The short red line is the initial taxi route DL2422 took.  It is not clear where they transitioned to M, so I did not extend the red route past the first possible transition.</p>

<hr>

<p>There appears to be some controversy over the verbiage of ""behind"" used in the ATC taxi clearance.  The only reference I can find to this word in a cursory search is in FAA order 7110.65 (ATC procedures) in section 3-7-2 that gives example taxi clearances.  This does not define ""behind"" but does give distinct examples that clearly differentiate ""behind"" from ""follow"".  Given that I cannot find a better reference, all I can offer instead is years of experience in a 121 cockpit based at busy airports like IAH and EWR and plenty of visits to others like ORD, ATL, LAX, DTW, IAD, etc where clearances involving the words ""behind"" and ""follow"" are quite common.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Behind</strong> Use of this word means that you are waiting for an aircraft to pass.  You are giving right of way or yielding to the traffic in question.  This clearance is often given when holding short of an intersection and waiting for perpendicular traffic to cross the intersection before you continue through it.  Much like waiting at a stop sign in a car.  You are not expected to follow the airplane in question and even if you are assigned a turn to taxi along the same route as the airplane, you have your own clearance and are not following that aircraft.  </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Continental 1234 taxi to runway 22R at W via K hold short of S"", followed by ""Continental 1234 you'll see a B767 passing right to left on S, behind him continue to runway 22R at W via K R hold short of W""</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case it is quite explicit that an airplane will be passing across your route of taxi and after it passes you are to continue taxiing straight ahead -- not to follow that airplane.  Consider an alternate setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Continental 1234 taxi to runway 22R at W via K hold short of S"", followed by ""Continental 1234 you'll see a Citation from the right at S, behind him taxi via S W hold short of R.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, you are waiting for traffic from the right again, but this time you are turning left after it passes.  You will be taxiing behind it, but you are <em>not</em> following it.  The Citation has a clearance to taxi S, cross runway 29, to parking.  Your clearance is S turn right on W -- to follow the Citation would be wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow</strong> Use of this word means you are going to fall in behind this airplane and follow it wherever it goes.  You clearance is no longer a specific taxi route, but simply to follow the airplane.  </p>

<p>Examples:  </p>

<ul>
<li>""Jetlink 1234, your sequence is the third airbus to your right, the one painted purple.  Follow that airplane to runway 22R at W.  Once behind him, monitor tower, you are number 28 for departure."", which will be followed by</li>
<li>""United 3412, hold short of J, let the EMB-145 get in line then follow him to runway 22R at W.  Monitor tower passing L, you are number 29 for departure""</li>
</ul>

<p>These clearances are used to get airplanes in line in a specific sequence and simplify giving repeated complex taxi instructions when you can just follow to conga line to the runway.</p></li>

"What happens during a checkride for a private pilot license?","14737","","<p>For a Private Pilot License in USA, what happens when a student takes his/her checkride? I want to know the sequence of events. According to my knowledge, which is sort of vague, things proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Student takes an oral and written exam (not sure if it's on the same day of checkride or prior to that).</li>
<li>Examiner asks student to plan a cross-country flight.</li>
<li>Examiner and students go for this planned cross-country flight.</li>
<li>Examiner may or may not cancel this plan and ask student to go back (does not affect result).</li>
<li>At the end, examiner tells the student if he/she has passed or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I do not know is:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much of the above is accurate?</li>
<li>And how long does it take?</li>
<li>How are emergency procedures created and tested?</li>
<li>Who makes sure that the weather is suitable for flying?</li>
<li>What if the checkride has to be cancelled for reasons not controlled by student?</li>
<li>What else did I miss?</li>
</ul>
","<p>That's pretty much the checkride in a nutshell - for all the details on what's expected you should refer to the <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_standards/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAA Practical Test Standards</a> for the rating you're pursuing.</p>

<h3>Before your checkride</h3>

<p>At some point before your checkride you must take a ""knowledge test"" (the ""written exam"") - you must pass that exam in order to qualify to take the checkride (the ""practical test"").<br>
The results of the knowledge test are good for 2 years.</p>

<p>You will also receive instruction from your CFI specifically for ""checkride preparation"" (you must have 3 hours of this instruction within the 60 days prior to taking your checkride).</p>

<p>Usually your instructor or school will arrange for an examiner. Be sure to find out where he wants you to plan your cross-country trip to, and also ask for his weight (so you can do the weight and balance calculations), and the cost of the checkride (so you can have the money ready).</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Oral Exam</h3>

<p>The day of your checkride<sup>1</sup> you'll probably spend at least as much time on the ground with the examiner than in the air.  </p>

<p>You'll start with the practicalities: making sure your <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentid/185868"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">8710</a> is in order, <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1199/what-are-the-requirements-to-take-the-private-pilot-check-ride"">verifying your eligibility</a>, and paying the examiner. </p>

<p>Next, you'll go over your logbook with the examiner (do everyone a favor and bookmark all the things they'll need to see), and then you'll be given <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr483zBbQKw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a thorough oral grilling</a><sup>2</sup> by the examiner.</p>

<p>You'll be expected to know your aircraft's V speeds, it's useful load, and its fuel capacity (in gallons and hours), and you might have to be able to answer intelligently based on a scenario, like ""supposed you want to take 3 members of your football team's lineup on a 300 mile trip...""</p>

<p>There will also be scenario-based regulatory questions (""You're taking your friends for a flight in the spring, but you haven't been in an airplane all winter. What do you need in order to be able to conduct this flight?"")</p>

<p>You will also be expected to plan (or have planned, depending on the examiner<sup>3</sup>) a cross-country flight (including a weight and balance calculation using the examiner's weight, and possibly including one or more fuel stops), and be able to explain your decision-making process for things like the planned course (if you don't fly in an absolute straight line) and your proposed altitude(s) and en-route waypoint(s).</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> - Usually you do the oral exam, then go fly.  Sometimes you may do the oral one day and the flight portion another day - for example if the weather is lousy.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> - This video is a little old, but a lot of it is still valid.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> - You used to have to complete the flight plan the day of the exam, within 30 minutes, but that requirement has vanished from the PTS. </p>

<hr>

<h3>The Flight Exam</h3>

<p>Every examiner conducts this a little differently - the tasks can be done in any order as long as they're all accomplished - but everyone I know has had the same basic sequence of events on their checkride.</p>

<p>After the oral you're going to get an update to your weather briefing (because you should), do a preflight inspection, get in the plane, and go fly your cross-country.</p>

<p>I've never met anyone who has actually flown the whole cross-country flight -- The examiner will typically have you fly through one or two waypoints to demonstrate that you can actually navigate, then you'll be told that something has gone awry and you need to divert (""The guy in the back is sick, take me to the closest airport before he hurls."").<br>
When you've demonstrated your ability to navigate and divert, you'll usually cancel your flight plan (if you opened one) and break off to do the required air work.</p>

<p>At some point during your checkride the examiner will give you an engine failure, because aircraft engines are supremely unreliable whenever an examiner or CFI is in the right seat. You will be expected to pick a suitable landing point, establish a glide to that landing point, and run the ""engine failure"" checklist appropriate to your plane.  The engine usually ""miraculously restarts"" at some point once the examiner is confident you would have been able to put the plane down on your intended landing spot.</p>

<p>The air-work consists of all the require flight maneuvers, such as steep turns, stalls, slips, and slow flight, the required ground reference maneuvers, and basic instrument maneuvers.</p>

<p>Once the air work is complete you'll return to the airport (or maybe to the airport you diverted to) for the dog-and-pony-show landings (one go-around -- usually called by the examiner with something exciting like ""There's a moose on the runway! Go around!"", one normal landing, one short-field landing over an FAA-Standard 50-foot giraffe, and one soft-field landing).</p>

<p>If you mess up and the examiner has to fail you they will tell you immediately after finishing the maneuver that you busted on. You <em>usually</em> have the option of continuing the test and completing the remaining tasks unless you did something that made the examiner fear for his or her life (if you're comfortable continuing this reduces the number of tasks you'll have to complete when you re-take the checkride).</p>

<p>Assuming you don't screw any thing up too badly, scare the examiner, or hit anything taxiing back to the ramp you're a private pilot - the examiner will fill out the appropriate paperwork, sign your logbook, and issue you your temporary certificate.  </p>

<hr>

<h3>Your specific questions that I didn't answer above</h3>

<p><strong>How long does it take?</strong><br>
My checkride took about 3-4 hours -- about 1-2 hours for the logbook review &amp; oral, just over an hour in the plane, and about an hour of ""miscellaneous bits"" (re-briefing the weather, the preflight, securing the plane after the practical portion of the test, completing the IACRA paperwork to make your new certificate/rating official).</p>

<p><strong>How are emergencies created/tested?</strong><br>
The standard engine failure is usually created by pulling the throttle back. Your examiner may throw other curve balls at you (like handing you the foggles and saying ""You just flew into a cloud, get us out of it.""), or create random distractions (""dropping"" their pen during climb-out appears to be a favorite from reading other people's checkride stories).<br>
What's important isn't how the situations arise, but how you handle them.  The examiner wants to see you fly the airplane safely, run the appropriate checklist(s), and handle the emergency in such a way that they're confident if it happened for real you'd be able to do the right thing.</p>

<p><strong>Who makes sure the weather is suitable for flying?</strong><br>
<em>You do!</em> You are acting as Pilot In Command for your checkride, and you are expected to exercise sound judgment.<br>
The examiner is not going to let you take off into a thunderstorm or gale-force winds (examiners have excellent self-preservation instincts. Most of them are or were flight instructors.), but if the <em>examiner</em> has to be the one to say ""Yeah, I don't think we should fly in this weather"" that's a guaranteed failure.</p>

<p><strong>What if the checkride has to be cancelled for reasons not controlled by the student?</strong><br>
If you've already started (e.g. taken the oral, but can't do the flight portion because of weather, or the plane develops a mechanical problem) you'll receive a ""notice of discontinuance"" and reschedule the remainder of the exam.<br>
Typically you can do this within 60 days, and you'll only have to do the portions of the exam you didn't do previously (though you can be re-tested on everything).<br>
The same thing happens if you or the examiner have to cancel the exam for reasons not related to your aeronautical performance (that triple-breakfast-burrito on checkride day was <em>NOT</em> a good idea and you need to get back on the ground <em>RIGHT NOW</em>).</p>

<p><strong>What else did I miss?</strong><br>
Probably a lot. I probably missed a lot too.<br>
My checkride wasn't that long ago but I really don't remember much about it.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that the DE will bust you for one deviation or one wrong answer on the oral. That's simply not true. You must perform at an ""acceptable level of competence,"" and only if you fail to perform at such a level will you be failed. The best way to avoid this is to acknowledge the deviation by saying something like ""I'm low, correcting,"" and then correct. That way the DE knows you know what is happening in the plane, and that you are taking positive steps to correct it.</p>

<p>Also, don't think the DE can read your mind. Brief out loud everything that is happening in the plane: annunciate the checklist items, and say ""takeoff checklist complete"" when you're done; when you scan for traffic or make a clearing turn, say ""clearing""; if you see a plane say something like ""traffic, 4 o'clock low, opposite direction, no factor."" The more you say, the more the DE knows how you think, and aeronautical decision-making is one of the most important skills a pilot must learn.</p>

"Should full flaps be deployed on takeoff?","14722","","<p><strong>Are full flaps ever used on takeoff?</strong> </p>

<p>One flying book I read strongly discouraged anything more than quarter flaps on most planes due to the amount of drag produced. I was just wondering if there are any scenarios where full flaps might be necessary.</p>
","<p>First, you have to remember on some configurations, the lower stages of flap will mostly add drag and very little lift. Sometimes that extra notch of full flaps is only there to change the camber of the wing to add a bit of a nose down attitude to help with visibility on landing. Both are items you do not require on takeoff.</p>

<p>Now, when selecting flaps for take-off there are two things to consider: runway length and obstacles to clear after the runway:</p>

<p><strong>Runway Length</strong></p>

<p>Generally when lowering flaps your $V_{\text{mu}}$ (the speed at which you become airborne, “minimum unstick speed”) will decrease. This  means a shorter runway for normal stages of flaps. As you continue to add more flaps your $V_{\text{mu}}$ will be lower, but because of the added drag, which decreases acceleration,  it will actually take a longer distance to reach that lower $V_{\text{mu}}$. There is a sweet spot in-between, though. “Take-off Flaps” is not always designed to give you the shortest takeoff roll.</p>

<p><strong>Obstacle Clearance</strong></p>

<p>And that is because once airborne, the more flaps you have deployed, the higher the drag, the less excess thrust available, thus the less you can climb. Simply put, you are now flying at a low speed and barely climbing. Not a good idea if there are tall trees waiting for you at the end of the runway.</p>

<p><strong>It would be illegal</strong>  to take-off on full flaps if:</p>

<ul>
<li>POH says it is prohibited,or</li>
<li>For commercial flying, if the flap setting does not provide the minimum required gross obstacle clearance climb gradient (depending on the type of operation and number of engines, between 2.4%-3.0% ).</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Diagrams in news organisations graphics published in March and April 2014 vary widely in what they show and appear to be artistic impressions. These should not be relied on in any way.</p>

<p>To calculate a variety of likely flight paths, it seems Inmarsat engineers, and other parties to the official investigation, used a number of sets of information including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>satellite communication timings giving distances from satellite.</li>
<li>satellite communications frequency variations giving relative motions.</li>
<li>knowledge of variations in satellite orbit.</li>
<li>knowledge of variations in satellite temperatures (daylight exposure etc)</li>
<li>knowledge about signal processing timings in various equipment.</li>
<li>characteristics of the aircraft (load, fuel consumption rates, etc)</li>
<li>autopilot modes of operation (route, heading, track. magnetic, true, ...)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis was improved and refined over time, resulting in newer estimates of the flight path and final coordinates.</p>

<p>Other independent groups of people have published their own analyses which come to broadly similar conclusions. E.g. the self-titled ""Independent Group"" associated with <a href=""http://www.duncansteel.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Duncan Steel</a></p>

  <p>""The investigations team received the complete <strong>raw Inmarsat satellite data</strong>, which included the <strong>six handshakes</strong> at approximately 3 pm on Wednesday, March 12.""</p>
  
  <p>""This type of data is not normally used in investigations of this sort.
  It is only because we have so little other information to go on in this difficult and unprecedented situation that the data is being used.    </p>
  
  <p>""Upon receiving the raw data, the Malaysian authorities immediately discussed with the US team how this information might be used. The US team and the investigations team then <strong>sent the data to the US</strong>, where further processing was needed before it could be used.    </p>
  
  <p>""Initial results were received on Thursday, March 13 at approximately 1.30 pm, but it was agreed by the US team and the investigations team that further refinement was needed, so the data was again sent back to the US.    </p>
  
  <p>""The results were received at approximately 2.30 pm on Friday, March 14 and presented to the investigations team at a high-level meeting at 9 pm on Friday.
  The <strong>UK AAIB</strong>, who had also been processing this data independently, presented their results - which <strong>concurred</strong> with ours and those of the US team – at that meeting.   </p>
  
  <p>""The Prime Minister was briefed on this satellite information at 8 am Saturday, March 15 and publicly announced it at the press conference at Saturday lunchtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(my emphasis)</p>

<p>Obviously the above does not describe the actual calculations involved. However it does confirm that the satellite data had <strong>six</strong> handshakes (presumably at hourly intervals up to 08:11).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Early speculation</h2>

<p>The graphic below, illustrates one idea for how these track might have been deduced. It is a result of speculation rather than a reporting of information actually provided by the people who made the calculation.</p>

<p>The graphic suggests that the NTSB calculated possible paths based on data that is not public and that the NTSB were able to assign probabilities to those paths. As far as I know, neither Inmarsat, the NTSB nor the Australian government (or it's agencies) have made public the data or method of calculating these tracks.</p>

<p>The graphic below suggests several Inmarsat pings were used (the example shows 01:11, 02:11, 04:11, 05:11, 06:11, 07:11 and 08:11 but these are probably speculation). </p>

<p>So far as is publicly known, there was no ping at 09:11 or later which suggests the flight ended between 08:11 and 09:11. This is broadly consistent with maximum fuel range of the aircraft. The labelled NTSB solutions suggest that NTSB calculated that no other <em>constant speed (and heading?) tracks</em> fit the data.</p>

"How do aircraft stall warning systems work?","14536","","<p>If an aircraft stalls, there are stall warning systems called as Stall computers. Anyone has idea how they predict that its a stall and how they raise the alarm/warning?</p>
","<h2>Audible Warning</h2>

<p>On light aircraft there is a reed (much like used on a musical wind instrument) mounted on one wing root, which is angled such that at the Angle of Attack which would cause a stall, the reed ""plays"" which can be heard in the cockpit. </p>

<p>Here is a view of where this system is mounted on a Cessna</p>

<p>On some aircraft, it is a similar principal, however instead of a reed, it uses a fin which at critical AoA pushes a micro-switch which activates a buzzer/horn inside the cockpit.</p>

<p>Here is the assembly on a Beech 18</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.eaa1000.av.org/pix/beech18/stall.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">stall warner http://www.eaa1000.av.org/pix/beech18/stall.jpg</a></p>

<p>So, if you ever see anyone doing this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.boldmethod.com/images/pages/about-us/aleks-first-kiss.jpg"" alt=""kiss the wing""></p>

<p>They are not kissing their aircraft for good luck, merely testing the stall warn as part of pre-flight checks!</p>

<h2>Tactile Warning</h2>

<p>In addition to an audible reed/buzz/horn, most aircraft also provide tactile feedback to the pilot of an impending stall. In purely mechanical aircraft the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot when approaching a stall. In hydraulic or fly-by-wire aircraft, this is provided by a mechanical ""stick shaker"" linked to the same system as sounding the audible alarm.</p>

"Why do airplanes have to retract landing gear?","14428","","<p>Why do all the airplanes have to retract their landing gear, once they reach some specific height? Why can't they simply leave their landing gear deployed all through the flight?</p>
","<p>In the early days of aviation it was simply easier to have the gear fixed. The landing gear adds drag, but so does <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biplane"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a second wing</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_wires"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wire braces</a>. Airplanes generally did not fly very fast or far, so the drag from the landing gear (and that other stuff) was not a big issue. The first design with retractable gear <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/13231/1696"">dates to 1911</a>. Since then, retractable gear has been a design decision each airplane must make.</p>

<p>Retracting the gear into the airplane allows for a cleaner form, which reduces drag. However, this is at the expense of added weight. The retract system, which is usually hydraulic, must be added, and the plane must be designed to make room for the gear somewhere at least mostly inside the aircraft. The plane must also be designed to handle situations where some or all of the gear does not extend properly. For planes that need to be fast and/or efficient, retractable gear is worth the reduction in drag.</p>

<p>The additional drag has to be supported by the structure as well. Aircraft with retractable gear will have a maximum speed at which the gear can be extended. Even gear with proper fairings would add significant drag at the speeds airliners fly at. This would be much more critical at supersonic speeds. In these cases the weight of reinforcing the gear could be even higher than the weight of the retracting system.</p>

<p>Particularly smaller general aviation planes tend to not have retractable gear. The retract system adds extra weight and complexity (and therefore cost), which will be fairly significant in a small plane. Fixed gear is simple and can be designed to minimize drag as much as possible. These planes do not typically need to fly fast or have large range, so the added drag is less of an issue. Other small planes do have retractable gear, which will allow for greater speed and range. The PA-32 type shown in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/16438/1696"">Dave's answer</a> was later produced in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-32R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">retractable gear version</a> as well.</p>

"What happens when the logbook of an aircraft is lost?","14376","","<p>If the logbook for an aircraft is lost, how does one replace it? Is the airplane still airworthy?</p>
","<p>In order to state the plane is airworthy you must be able to show that all AD's have been complied with and that the aircraft is within annual (or 100 hour) inspection; these proofs are typically found in the logbook so no, without the logbook your aircraft is probably not airworthy. It may be possible to fly the plane legally in the US anyway if you receive authorization from your FSDO (which, I believe, would be a ""ferry permit"").</p>

<p>It's not legally required that your logbook be complete to the beginning of time, just that it shows the current requirements are met (along with the signatures/cert numbers of the AI's that are stating them to be met). However, an incomplete logbook is very important from a resale point of view. Not having complete logs will make a plane very difficult to sell and will certainly affect the price most purchasers would be willing to pay.</p>

"Can commercial airliners fly over hurricanes?","14288","","<p>When Patricia was making landfall yesterday I opened up Flight Radar 24 to see if there were any planes flying around or near it.  As I had expected, there were a couple of storm watching planes near the hurricane, but what surprised me is that there were some commercial flights that seemed to be going over portions of the hurricane...</p>

<p>So, I'm curious, can commercial aircraft go high enough to simply fly over a hurricane, assuming they take off and land at airports that are not effected by the storm?  Or perhaps they can only safely fly over the fringes and need to stay away from the eye?</p>

<p>Basically, can airliners fly over hurricanes, and if so can they fly over all of it, or just parts?</p>
","<p>In general, no- except in emergencies or 'small' hurricanes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Commercial aircraft usually fly <em>around</em> bad weather (like hurricanes), not over it.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the hurricanes can reach upto 50,000+ ft height, making it all but impossible for most modern commercial aircraft to fly over them (except maybe you're flying a Concorde). Even for smaller storms, the convective process over the hurricane will cause severe turbulence, affecting overflying flights.</p></li>
<li><p>Even for hurricanes where the  aircraft can fly over, there is the problem of safety- What will happen is something happens (for example engine failure) and the aircraft has to descend to lower altitudes? Obviously no one wants to descend into the storm.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some aircraft <a href=""http://www.hurricanehunters.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">that do fly into hurricanes</a> for scientific experiments. These are crewed by trained (and experienced) specialists and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/29/flying-into-hurricane-ire_n_936225.html?ir=India&amp;adsSiteOverride=in"" rel=""noreferrer"">involve a lot of detailed planning</a>. For example, the aircraft are equipped with radar that helps in avoiding the worst parts of the storm. Still, it is risky and the aircraft is exposed to significant loads and vibrations not usually exposed in commercial service.  </p></li>

"Who authorizes low visibility takeoff operations for airlines, and what is required?","14284","","<p>A <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/281/takeoff-and-landing-in-zero-visibility"">previous question</a> pondered the legality and safety of low visibility Part 91 takeoffs. I am wondering about the requirements for low visibility takeoff for commercial airline operators (e.g. Part-121 scheduled operations). I know of authorizations for operators down to 600 RVR (though I believe I recall 300 RVR for one carrier out of DEN), and various requirements for other increments below standard takeoff minima.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which RVR are authorized and what ground equipment requirements need to be met to use them?</li>
<li>What authorizes (regulation? op spec?) these reduced visibility operations? </li>
</ul>
","<p>The Part 121 regulation that governs low visibility takeoffs are specified in 14 CFR 121.651.  It references company OpSpecs and 91.175 and Part 97:</p>

<hr>

<p>""Standard"" takeoff minimums are specified in 14 CFR 91.175 and would be the highest of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-standard takeoff minimums specified on the airport charts (FAR 97)</li>
<li>For aircraft, other than helicopters, having two engines or less — 1 statute mile visibility.</li>
<li>For aircraft having more than two engines — 1⁄2 statute mile visibility.</li>
<li>For helicopters — 1⁄2 statute mile visibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpSpec C056 is issued to all 121 carriers, and basically just spells out the ""standard"" takeoff minimums that I listed above, and specifies that RVR must be used if it is available on the runway.</p>

<hr>

<p>OpSpec C078 is normally issued and allows taking off with lower than standard visibility as long as the airport doesn't already have published higher than standard takeoff minimums.  This is a fairly involved OpSpec with several optional paragraphs, and operators may be approved for takeoff operations down to and including 300 RVR.  For those not familiar with the term, RVR (Runway Visual Range) is the distance that a pilot can see down the runway, measured by automatic equipment,  and is measured in feet in the US.</p>

<p>It offers approvals for the following visibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>1/4 SM / RVR 1600:
<ul>
<li>Touchdown zone RVR (or mid RVR if touchdown zone is inop) is controlling:</li>
<li>Requires ""runway markings or runway lighting provide pilots with adequate visual reference to continuously identify the takeoff surface and maintain directional control throughout the takeoff run."" (Basically as long as the pilot feels comfortable, but specifically mentions HIRL, CL, and RCLM as okay.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RVR 1000 (optional)
<ul>
<li>Touchdown zone RVR and rollout RVR (A mid-RVR report may be substituted for either if they are inop, but still must have two systems) are both controlling</li>
<li>Requires Runway Centerline Lights (CL)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RVR 500 (optional)
<ul>
<li>Touchdown zone RVR, mid RVR, and rollout RVR are all controlling (one may be inop)</li>
<li>Requires Operative runway centerline lights (CL)</li>
<li>Requires Runway centerline markings (RCLM)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RVR 300 (optional)
<ul>
<li>Requires a takeoff guidance system</li>
<li>Requires operative high intensity runway lights (HIRL)</li>
<li>Requires operative runway centerline lights (CL)</li>
<li>Requires serviceable runway centerline markings (RCLM)</li>
<li>Front course guidance from the localizer (if applicable to the system used)</li>
<li>Crosswind less than 10 knots</li>
<li>Touchdown zone RVR, mid RVR, and rollout RVR are all controlling (one may be inop)</li>
<li>Requires special training requirements for both the PIC and SIC</li>

"Why do the engines seem to power down and then back up after take-off?","14194","","<p>What is the phenomenon on a commercial airliner (say, a 737-800) where shortly after takeoff and before we reach 10,000 feet the engines feel like they slow down dramatically or even power off momentarily, then spin back up?</p>

<p>This happens fairly frequently when I'm flying and, although I'm used to it, it still takes me by surprise every time!</p>
","<p>There are several kinds of power reduction which could happen after takeoff:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cutback (noise reduction when the airplane is very low, after takeoff)</li>
<li>Climb thrust</li>
</ol>

<p>Both are set on the CDU (Control Display Unit, the screen and keyboard of the FMC, Flight Management Computer).</p>

<p>Since you describe a <strong>temporary</strong> and <strong>dramatical</strong> power decrease, this should be the <strong>cutback</strong>. When you hear the power increase again, it must be that the setting goes from cutback to climb thrust.</p>

<h1>In the B737-800</h1>

<h2>The cutback option on the CDU</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>This is the CDU (Control Display Unit), where you set up the cutback. It is in the second page of TAKEOFF REF. Here is the screen before turning cutback ON.<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J0R8F.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqKdS.png"" alt=""Cutback off""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ACCEL HT</strong> : This is the height (above ground level) at which we will let the plane accelerate (we will lower the pitch a little bit and gradually retract flaps).</li>
<li><strong>EO ACCEL HT</strong>: Same as above, but applies when one engine is not running (Engine Out Accelaration Height). This setting will be used in case of engine failure after takeoff.</li>
<li><strong>REDUCTION</strong>: This is the height at which the thrust setting will go from TOGA to CLIMB. We need maximal thrust during takeoff, because it's a critical phase and it's safer. But at the same time, keeping this setting too long decreases the engines lifetime because of the high temperature. It also burns more fuel, it's noisier and less environment-friendly. That's the reason why the airplane won't climb with maximum thrust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But this question is about cutback. Here is CDU again after turning cutback ON.<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VnVEX.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wRcM.png"" alt=""Cutback on""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CUTBACK N1</strong>: This will be the target N1 setting when the REDUCTION height will be reached. The Auto-throttle together with the EEC will arrange for maintaining this lower shaft speed (here you can see it's 84,6%). This will be a lot less noisy but will still provide enough power to climb!</li>
<li><strong>EO ACCEL HT</strong>: Same as above</li>

"How does one become an airline pilot in Australia?","14167","","<p><strong>I am 19 years old and from a young age I have always wanted to become a pilot at an airline. Becoming one is my biggest dream, to me an airline pilot is the most coolest jobs - I get goosebumps just by thinking about me in that position.</strong></p>

<p>I have finished my high school education and hope to go to Australia to study in order to become a pilot. However, most of the university programs don't give me the feeling that I can become a pilot. Most of what is learned and practiced is in small planes, even the career opportunities don't mention that one will become an airline pilot.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the best and fastest way to make my dream come true? What should I do?</p>

<hr>

<p>The only course that has got me attracted to is the one that's in Swinburne University, but then again, <strong>small planes</strong>. I am fine with flying small planes, but where does that big jump to airplanes happen, if it's not taught in university. Where do I learn it? Does anyone know the procedure or the best place to train to become a pilot?</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, I'm not an Australian so I will be an international student. I have checked for jobs in my home country airlines, they require a minimum of 5000 hours of flight, does this mean normal plane flight hours? Where will I get these hours covered from? Of course this many hours aren't offered in university. </p>
","<p>I am Australian and I hope I can help. </p>

<p>Firstly, you don't need to fly through a university. There are hundreds of private flight schools here which are of great quality, and very few of them are associated with a university. More and more international airlines are sending cadet pilots to our schools. Most of them offer theory courses in addition to the flying, or you can always self study. </p>

<p>Having said that, the university courses are great and airlines like people with a degree (but it's not mandatory to have one). You'll be paying more though, it's a trade-off. </p>

<p>Your comment about small planes - All flying is initially in light aircraft - even if you got an airline cadetship you start small. No single course in Australia or anywhere will let your first flight be in a jet. </p>

<p>Speaking of airline cadetships - these are definitely the best and quickest way to get into an airline cockpit but the positions are highly competitive (and maybe not open to international students, I don't know). But you can still get an airline job without a cadetship...</p>

<p>The normal progression is this - you can technically get a flying job after 150-200 hours of private training and flying, having achieved your commercial pilot licence (CPL). I say 'technically' because if you only have minimum hours and minimum qualifications you have to look very hard for a job. Most people straight away get an instructor rating, so they can get a job teaching people to fly. Other early jobs include sightseeing flights, parachute flights, and mail flights to remote towns. </p>

<p>Your training will have been in light aircraft, but fortunately Australia has possibly the largest light aircraft industry in the world, so there's lots of jobs in these planes. It's highly unlikely that your first job will be in anything bigger than a 6 seater plane. </p>

<p>If you get extra qualifications (such as multi-engine endorsement, and instrument rating), you can get more jobs, and gradually fly bigger aircraft. </p>

<p>After you have your CPL, the next big step is the Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). Regional airlines here generally require as a minimum, 1000 flying hours in light aircraft, the multi engine rating, the instrument rating, and passes in the ATPL theory exams - note that you don't necessarily need the ATPL licence itself. It will take most people a couple of years until they get this experience.</p>

<p>If you have that much experience flying 6 to 8 seat aircraft, it's not actually a huge leap to the 20 seat planes of the regional airlines, and the airlines will train you for this step. And once you've flown those for long enough any airline can train you to their jet.</p>

<p>Of course if you want to go back home after the training it will be different. But no school here can train anyone to go straight to an airline. You've got to do the small things first. Think of it as character building!</p>

<p>I'm sorry but I'm a bit rushed for time but I hope I've helped a bit. Australia is one of the best places in the world to train in my opinion (but I might be biased!). Please ask if you have any more questions. And good luck. </p>

"Why couldn't the A380 secure any orders for two straight years?","14167","","<p>The double-decker aircraft has failed to win a single <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Airbus_A380_orders_and_deliveries"" rel=""noreferrer"">order</a> from any new airline customer for two years now. Comparing its orders and sales with its biggest competitor, the B747 it had received 315 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747#Orders_and_deliveries"" rel=""noreferrer"">orders</a> in its first 10 years, about 40 years back. Today though, the A380 has recieved 317 in its first 8 years, but it failed to receive even a single order in past two years. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s true the market hasn’t developed as much as we’d have liked,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said this month. “This plane was probably launched 10 years too early.” (<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-26/airbus-a380-haunted-by-lack-of-orders-marks-decade-in-the-skies"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why couldn't the A380 sell as much as the B747, even though it has won many admirers in a shorter period of time. Also, a rough <a href=""http://planes.axlegeeks.com/compare/242-282/Airbus-A380-800-vs-Boeing-747-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">comparison</a> shows A380 is worth its price, when compared to 747-8. But the 747-8 is still getting more <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-8#Orders_and_deliveries"" rel=""noreferrer"">orders</a> than the A380.</p>

<p>Update : Iran Air has finally ordered some A380s in February 2016.</p>
","<p>Several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A380s are <em>really</em> expensive.</strong> Unit cost for an A380, depending on interior appointments, is about \$375 million. The 747-8 is about \$357 million. The 777-300ER is about \$320 million, the last variants of the A340 about \$275 million, and the 787 about \$200 million. The 380 might be the biggest airliner ever to fly, but it's also the most expensive. Keep in mind these jets can't fly every day, requiring you to buy a couple more than the schedule requires and rotate them in as maintenance is required on each airframe. That means A380 operators have at least one three hundred and eighty million dollar airframe sitting on the tarmac not making money on any given day (in fact, up to 55 days at a time for the 6-year ""D check"" maintenance, not counting lower-level maintenance performed more often as well as any unscheduled maintenance).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Airbus could not/cannot build them fast enough to meet initial orders in a timely manner.</strong> Airbus received 189 initial A380 orders prior to the airframe's scheduled start of production in 2007, plus 27 A380F variant orders, and has received 128 since production began (though the freighter orders were cancelled). To date, it's only delivered about half due to a combination of issues found during full-scale production that delayed ramp-up, and currently its pace is about 30 planes a year, giving it about a 3 year backlog of remaining orders (some of which have been sitting in the build queue for 10 years). It initially prioritized passenger variants for Emirates, which put in the largest single order (almost half of total orders) to handle that airline's primarily long-haul schedule. As a result, everyone else got pushed off until many (including FedEx and UPS which were waiting for freight versions) cancelled their orders and went to Boeing for 747-8Fs or 777-ERFs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jumbos represent a serious cost-revenue risk that most airlines are no longer willing to gamble on.</strong> You use a jumbo jet when you need to move a lot of people at one time. That typically means a high-demand, long-distance route that calls for nonstop service, but that you don't want to have to fly any more times than you have to. 747s used to be used for high-volume domestic connectors in the US during and immediately after the regulation era, between major cities like New York, Chicago, LA, Houston, Miami etc. They were also used for major intercontinental flights, primarily because regulations required more than two engines for trips extending a certain distance beyond the nearest divert field. However, the 747 is a 50-year-old design with only incremental improvements made in efficiency. Four engine jets in the modern air transport market require you to fill the plane every time, and with ETOPS-rated two-engine widebodies now making many of the same flights that previously required three or more engines, the A380, even with the most efficient engines ever put on a commercial airliner, is at least three decades late to the jumbo party, and is entering the market at a time when the 747 is being phased out of most fleets in favor of more economical widebodies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The A380 was designed for an air travel market that hasn't materialized.</strong> Airbus was betting big (NPI) on airport congestion and increased passenger counts during the 80s and 90s requiring a shift to fewer flights on larger-capacity planes to reduce pattern and gate congestion. Except for a few major metropolitan areas that simply cannot grow their airports anymore (O'Hare, LaGuardia/JFK, Heathrow etc) that hasn't really been the case. 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis have seen passenger counts plummet from post-regulation highs, which has reduced total flights and allowed smaller planes which are more efficiently scheduled. In addition, Denver opened up the largest airport by land area in the world (so it has plenty of room to grow), while Atlanta, Dallas, Charles de Galle and others are busy primarily because they're massive complexes with efficient layouts that can support a major airline's hub operations. The use of jumbos in general is therefore very risky, and many airlines, in addition to passing on the A380, are phasing out the venerable 747 that was previously unchallenged in this class, in favor of something a little more economical in the next smaller widebody class, like the 777, 787, A340 or A350. That was Boeing's bet, that smaller, high-efficiency jets would be the wave of the future over pure size, and it seems to be paying off as Boeing, despite higher production capacities, has more 787 orders than it has capacity for the foreseeable future, while Airbus's competing A350 is more or less getting the overflow (and it can't even meet that demand; 700 orders, 5 produced).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The A380 really doesn't solve the problem it was created for, and in fact causes more problems for airports than it solves.</strong> A super-heavy like the A380 creates monumental wake turbulence that poses a danger to other planes, which requires ATC to space following traffic further back (up to double the time/distance compared to a midbody), while for smaller jets (even widebodies), approach control can usually get away with a little more than standard 2-minute spacing unless the plane behind it is a much smaller regional jet or GA prop. So, the A380 can carry about 520 passengers in mixed-class configuration (Emirates' 6-star config seating only about 490), but takes up two ""slots"" in the approach pattern, while a 777 can carry 320 passengers in mixed-class layout and can be spaced much more closely to other airliners. So in terms of maximizing total passenger movement at an airport, two 777s or A340s are better than one A380.</p>

<p>At the gate, the A380 causes even more headaches. It's so honkin' <em>big</em> that adjacent gates typically can't be used while it's parked, and it often requires additional jetways to efficiently board and deplane its passengers. As one example, DFW's Terminal D was fairly recently renovated to be the airport's primary international terminal, including Gate 16 in the southwest corner specifically intended to allow 747s to park with minimal adjacent gate disruption (17 couldn't be used, but 18 was available for smaller jets and 15 around the corner could handle pretty much any size):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OldV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OldV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>When the A380 came to DFW in 2014, with Qantas replacing the 747 on the famous Flight 7 and Flight 8 from Sydney to DFW (the longest scheduled passenger flights by travel time in the world), and Emirates commencing service to and from Dubai with A380s, DFW had to redesign this corner of the airport entirely, basically having the A380 come in diagonally to Gate 15. Gate 15 then services first class, 16's jetway was moved and extended to load and unload the lower deck, and a third jetway, 16X, was built adjacent to 16 solely for the A380's upper deck. The jetways for Gates 14 and 17 then had to be lengthened considerably to allow their use with a 380 at the ramp, otherwise the superjumbo would essentially take up 4 entire gates while parked:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.uta.edu/engineering/_images_2015/events/4903863_G.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://www.uta.edu/engineering/_images_2015/events/4903863_G.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kMkfF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kMkfF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As an aside for scale in the last image, Gate 14 to the right is in Sun Country livery which would make it a 737-700, while the American jet at the very top at Gate 19 is still in older livery, and with its long narrow body the best guess is a 757-200. Gate 17 looks like an Air Canada Rouge so with the body length I'd say A319, and Gate 18 is in new American livery so it's a 737-700. None of them really big aircraft by today's commercial standards, but they're certainly not puddle-jumpers either (all aircraft at this terminal are for international flights), and the Emirates A380 at gates 15/16/16X absolutely eclipses them all. It is a <em>big</em> jet.</p></li>

"Is it considered good or bad practice to raise the flaps right after touchdown?","14104","","<p>This question is about light, tricycle, single engine aircraft.</p>

<p>I have made it a habit to raise the flaps right after touchdown (when the nosewheel is on the ground). My instructor used to do that every time during initial training so I took over the habit.</p>

<p>It makes sense to do this for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>better braking performance because lift is reduced while rolling out</li>
<li>less crosswind effect, reducing the risk of loss of directional control after landing</li>
<li><em>(less important) it's part of the after landing checklist, so when it's done, it's done</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, I was recently checked out on a C182 that I wanted to rent in Florida and when I raised the flaps right after touchdown the instructor shouted ""<em>what the &lt; beep > are you doing? You should <strong>never</strong> raise the flaps until you've turned off the runway</em>"". He couldn't provide a good reason though, so when I told him about the things I listed above he simple mumbled something about keeping my attention on the runway instead of fiddling with the flaps lever (which is a something I don't even have to think about)</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>Is it really a bad idea to raise the flaps that soon after landing? Or is it actually a good habit?</strong></p>

<p><em>(I noticed that most airliners also wait until they're clear of the runway, but these jets have spoilers to get rid of all the lift)</em></p>
","<p>You should wait until clearing the runway before performing <strong>any</strong> non-essential checklist items because you are still in a critical phase of flight and at a relatively high risk while still on the runway.  You should focus 100% of your attention to controlling the airplane (don't stop flying the airplane until you come to a complete stop) and watching for other traffic (or someone crossing the runway in front of you) that might be a hazard.  </p>

<p>There is also the possibility that in a retractable gear airplane you could accidently retract the gear if you are moving things while still preoccupied with landing.  Once you exit the runway and come to a complete stop, you can devote the proper attention to the after landing checklist so will be more likely to complete it correctly without missing any items that may become an issue on your next flight.</p>

<p>That being said, follow the guidance in your POH.  Sometimes there are abnormal situations that actually call for this, like voretaq7 mentions in his answer, the Cherokee POH references it as a short field landing technique.</p>

<h1>FAA Guidance</h1>

<p>The FAA also covers this in <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2091-73B.pdf"">AC 91-73B - Parts 91 and 135 Single Pilot, Flight 
School Procedures During Taxi Operations</a>.   It says (in part):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>7. SINGLE-PILOT PROCEDURES.</strong>   </p>
  
  <p><strong>a. General.</strong> </p>
  
  <p>...  </p>
  
  <p>In addition, upon  landing, no items should be changed or moved until
  the entire aircraft has crossed the respective  runway’s hold short
  line. </p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p><strong>NOTE: After the entire aircraft crosses over the landing runway’s hold  short line, conduct after-landing checklist items, based upon
  company  procedures, before contacting ATC for taxi instructions.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>You could also fail a checkride for doing this</h1>

<p>The PTS also repeatedly stresses the  objective: </p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Utilizes after landing runway incursion avoidance procedures.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To figure out what they mean by that, we can look at their <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/phak%20-%20appendix%201.pdf"">Runway Incursion Avoidance</a> material, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, after landing and upon exiting  the runway, ensure your
  aircraft has completely crossed over  the runway hold markings. Once
  all parts of the aircraft have  crossed the runway holding position
  markings, you must hold  unless further instructions have been issued
  by ATC. <strong>Do not  initiate non-essential communications or actions until
  the  aircraft has stopped and the brakes set.</strong></p>

","<p>For most transport aircraft, aerodynamic efficiency is the key parameter as it allows lower fuel consumption. The layouts you see most often are the most efficient known:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For jets low swept wings with engines mounted under and ahead of the wings and conventional tail is most efficient known layout. Tail-mounted engines used to be common on smaller jets, but as that puts lot of bulk far aft, they are worse with respect to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Whitcomb area rule</a>, worse for weight and balance, and wing-mounted engines also help damp flutter. So new regiojets are switching to engines under wing too.</p></li>
<li><p>Propeller aircraft fly slower, so they have straight wings. Low mounted wings are slightly more efficient, but then the plane has to have long gear to maintain sufficient ground clearance for the propellers, so high wings are more common. T-tail is then simply used to put the elevator above the most turbulent wake of wing and engines.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The only deviations from these three basic layouts are on special-purpose plane that have other more important concern. The most notable is <em>military</em> cargo planes are generally high-wing so they can sit low on the ground for easy loading and unloading using built-in ramp. Their marked <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_(aeronautics)#Anhedral"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anhedral</a> is to avoid overstabilizing the aircraft in roll as both high wing and wing sweep increase roll stability. Earlier regiojet designs used tail-mounted engines for the same reason; to sit lower on the ground so they can be easily loaded via built-in airstairs and these are not too heavy and bulky.</p>

"Where did the standard pressure 29.92"" come from?","14023","","<p>Below the <em>transition altitude</em> (18,000 feet in the US), pilots use <em>local pressure</em> readings to calibrate their altimeters.</p>

<p>Above the <em>transition altitude</em>, pilots set a <em>standard pressure</em> to calibrate the altimeter. The standard pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury or 1013 hPa.</p>

<p>Where did this value come from?</p>
","<p>It is called ""standard pressure"" because 29.92 In-Hg (or 1013.25 hPa) is the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level according to both the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere"">ISA</a> (International Standard Atmosphere) and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Standard_Atmosphere"">US 1976 Standard Atmosphere</a>.</p>

<p>Below 18,000ft, local altimeter settings are used because you need to know how high you are above terrain, or whether or not you're at the proper altitude for an instrument approach, or at pattern altitude, etc. In cruising flight above 18,000ft, except for a few places in the world, you are well above any terrain, so errors in actual altitude of even a couple thousand feet is unlikely to cause a problem. In this case, having all airplanes use a common altimeter setting is useful because it 1. doesn't require you to change it frequently as you pass through changes in pressure, and 2. it helps ATC ensure separation without having to inform flights every 10 minutes of a new setting. It makes sense to use standard pressure in this case because it represents a good baseline average, and you may have noticed that reported altimeter settings tend to average around 29.92 anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, there are instances where you may still need to know the en-route altimeter settings for flight planning purposes. Suppose the minimum safe altitude along your route is 19,000 ft MSL and current pressure is 29.42. If you decided to cruise at FL190, you would actually be flying at about 18,500ft MSL, and would be below your minimum safe altitude. Colder than standard temperature can have similar effect as low pressure, and will result in the airplane being lower than the indicated altitude.</p>

"How are rocket engine nozzles able to survive very high temperatures without melting?","13980","","<p>The temperature of the gaseous products exiting from the nozzle is higher than the melting point of the nozzle material. So how do the nozzles survive without melting despite exposure to such temperatures? What is the feature which enables them to do so?</p>
","<p>There is actually quite a lot of information on the subject in the Braeunig web site <a href=""http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm"">Basics of Space Flight</a>. To give the salient points:</p>

<p><strong>Liquid-fueled rocket engines</strong></p>

<p>Both the nozzle <em>and</em> the combustion chamber itself need to be cooled. Although most of the thermal energy produced is ejected with the exhaust, some of it will indeed push hardware temperatures up if not checked. Techniques include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regenerative cooling, where the propergols (both propergols, or just the fuel) are pumped through a jacket around the nozzle before going into the combustion chamber. This cools down the nozzle, and heats up the propergols that may be cryogenic in nature. This is what was used in the Saturn Vs' Rocketdyne F-1 engines, and the Space Shuttle main engines.</li>
<li>Dump cooling, similar to the above but the fuel used to cool the nozzle is dumped overboard instead of being fed into the combustion chamber and being used as, well, fuel.</li>
<li>Film and transpirative cooling, where a thin film of coolant or fuel is created near the chamber wall.</li>
<li>Ablative cooling, where part of the combustion chamber or nozzle wall is sacrificed. As the material is melted or otherwise burned away, it absorbs some of the thermal energy, thus saving whatever is behind it.</li>
<li>Radiation cooling, where nozzle design is such that heat has time to be evacuated through the part's exterior wall. This is used mainly in small engines, not main.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solid-fueled rocket engines</strong></p>

<p>No information available. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. </p>

<p>It would seem that the nozzle and combustion chamber materials just need to be strong enough to withstand the heat from the burning gasses. It is perhaps worthwhile to note that solid rocket engines are designed to burn just one single time, and for a relatively short period of time (even the Space Shuttle boosters were extensively overhauled before being put back into service, with any necessary parts changed). Rocket engines need to withstand working conditions for just minutes, instead of the thousands of hours an A/C jet engine turbine would be expected to work without failure.</p>

<p>It would also be reasonable to assume -though this is strictly something I am making up on the go, with much hand waving- that of the techniques described above for liquid-fueled rocket engines, at least two could be easily adapted to solid engines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Film cooling, with an extra tank of cooling liquid on board.</li>
<li>Ablative cooling, with some refractive material used to coat the inner surface of the nozzle.</li>

"Why is tailwind during final approach and landing so dangerous?","13896","","<p>I understand that tailwind is typically a good thing during your flight as it increases your ground speed and gets you to your destination faster.  Despite that I get a feeling that pilots typically get very uncomfortable when there is a significant tailwind present during landing.  Sadly, recent proof of this danger was in Aspen, Colorado <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/05/us/colorado-plane-crash/"">accident</a></p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why are tailwinds bad during landing?</p></li>
<li><p>Given ""extra long"" runway for extended rollout, are there any dangers with landing at a higher ground speed?</p></li>
<li><p>How are tailwinds mitigated?  Would ATC just switch the landing direction?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>It's not so much a matter of ""pilots typically get very uncomfortable"" as it is ""pilots recognize that it is an inherently <em>less safe</em> situation"", and pilots (at least the ones you want to fly with) tend to be somewhat safety obsessed.</p>

<hr>

<p>So <strong>Why are tailwinds during landing ""bad""?</strong><br>
The same reason tailwinds in cruise flight are good: you're moving over the ground at a higher speed.<br>
The amount of energy the aircraft has (and thus its landing distance) is roughly proportional to the square of the <i>ground</i>speed.</p>

<p>Let's consider the plane I fly as an example (a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee"">Piper Cherokee</a>) because I know the numbers:<br>
if I'm flying by the book then when the wheels of my plane hit the ground my indicated airspeed should be around 45 knots.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Wind</strong><br>
If there's no wind my ground speed and my indicated airspeed will be about the same - my brakes will have to slow me from 45 knots to a stop before I run out of runway.<br>
The brakes on the Cherokee aren't Porsche brakes (they're tiny little things), but they're up to the task and a book-perfect landing would have me stopped in 600 feet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>15-Knot Headwind</strong><br>
A 15 knot headwind reduces my groundspeed to 30 knots - at 2/3 the speed I can stop much sooner with the same braking force, which means less wear on the brakes and a greater safety margin of runway remaining.<br>
A book-perfect landing in these conditions would have me stopped in about 270 feet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>15-knot Tailwind</strong><br>
A 15 knot tailwind increases my groundspeed to 60 knots. The tiny little brakes on the Cherokee <em>CAN</em> stop me, but they're going to take much longer to do so: A book-perfect landing would take over 1000 feet to stop (nearly twice the ""normal"" no-wind landing roll).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The big consideration above is landing distance -- as you noted in your question you can solve that with a longer runway (more pavement means more room to stop), but <strong>there are other dangers with tailwind landings</strong>, mainly in the fact that <em>Landings don't always go according to plan</em>.<br>
The slower your groundspeed at landing the less energy you have to get rid of if something goes wrong</p>

<p>Consider the three landings I outlined above, but let's add a problem to the mix: One of my tires blows right at touchdown, and the plane veers off the runway into a ditch.<br>
There is much less energy to dissipate with a 15-knot headwind (30kt groundspeed) than there is with a 15-knot tailwind (60kt groundspeed) - it's roughly the difference between crashing your car driving through a school zone versus speeding on a highway.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Fortunately it's really easy to avoid landing with a tailwind -- <em>most</em> runways are bidirectional (Aspen, which you mentioned in your question, is a notable exception due to geography).</p>

<p>ATC (or at uncontrolled fields, the pilots themselves) will ""turn the airport around"" once a certain tailwind limit is reached.  Precisely when that happens depends on the airport and the traffic mix (at my home field, with mostly small piston aircraft, ATC will typically switch the runway when the tailwind component exceeds 5 knots - at JFK they might land a jet with a 10-knot tailwind rather than messing up the arrivals).<br>
Of course there's nothing that says a pilot has to accept a landing with a tailwind: If the pilot is not comfortable with the conditions they can request a runway aligned so the winds are more favorable. (There is a <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/jkf_construction_crosswind_American_pilots_clearance_crosswind_emergency_202510-1.html"">somewhat famous case of an airline pilot at JFK</a> who ultimately decided to declare an emergency to ensure a landing on a favorable runway). </p>

"Why do aircraft have an unusable amount of fuel?","13890","","<p>I learned from <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/13302/how-can-i-correctly-calculate-fuel-for-a-cessna-152"">this question</a> that a Cessna 152 holds 5.6 litres of fuel that it can't use. </p>

<p>Why would it be designed to hold fuel that it cannot burn, especially since water contamination of fuel is a concern?</p>
","<p>Pilot here (with Cessna 152 hours) as well as an engineer who made it most of the way to an Airframe and Powerplant technician license at one point in life.</p>

<p>There are several reasons that conspire to produce 'unusable fuel':</p>

<ol>
<li>Fuel tanks on airplanes have complex shapes - they include baffles and other walls (with holes in them) to prevent oscillations from building up during in-flight movement. Sometimes these baffles are even engineered into the tanks late in the design cycle as testing finds oscillation issues. These baffles result in 'geometric trapping' of fuel in nooks and crannies. </li>
<li>Drawing fuel from a fuel tank is more complicated in a plane - cars are pretty much flat with minor tilts while airframes can have all sorts of odd and sustained directions that the fuel wants to go due to acceleration. Imagine an extended tilted spiral while descending - that fuel experiences far more lateral acceleration over a longer time period that a car would have. Getting the fuel system to pull fuel out from these different angles is challenging (note that I've picked a non-aerobatic maneuver for which the Cessna 152 of your question is qualified here).</li>
<li>All of this is a cost/complexity tradeoff - solutions exist for 1 and 2 above - fighter jets use fuel bladders that have pressure bladders arranged to squeeze the fuel out so that they can get almost all the fuel even at high G-forces and unusual angles. Aerobatic planes have similarly more expensive and complicated systems than the old and cheap Cessna 152.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are other considerations as well, but mostly it comes down to whether the plane in question can justify the cost and effort to get every last drop of fuel.</p>

<p>Things get even more complicated in rockets - the moon rockets (properly the Saturn 5 although it was an upper stage specifically) had special extra engines called ullage motors whose only job was to give the stage a little boost in space to push the fuel towards the rear of the rocket so that the main motors could draw fuel and start.</p>

<p>Addendum edit: @supercat below - the definition of unusable fuel is set by federal aviation regulation part 23, section 959 (<a href=""http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_23-959.html"">FAR 23.959</a>) and basically is the worst case under ""intended operation"" for the particular plane. Since the Cessna 152 is not aerobatically rated, for example, the unused fuel is defined as the fuel level where SOME intended maneuver would be capable of causing a fuel system error. In practice, especially in flat level flight, some of that unusable fuel would be available for use although you are not supposed to plan to use it in your flight planning.</p>

"What exactly is VMO and how does it affect a plane when it is exceeded?","13821","","<p>I read an article that mentioned ""V<sub>MO</sub>"" speeds of a 747 and that the plane, when it exceeds its V<sub>MO</sub>, shakes uncontrollably and destroys itself.</p>

<p>I've never heard of planes doing this and the article explained V<sub>MO</sub> in a way that is beyond my understanding. </p>

<p>For someone that doesn't know much about aviation: </p>

<p>What does V<sub>MO</sub> stand for and how does it affect planes when exceeded? If it does cause the plane to shake to the point that it destroys itself, why is that?</p>
","<p>$V_{MO}$ is a “maximum operating speed”. It is one of many “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds"" rel=""nofollow"">V-speeds</a>” defined for an aircraft that limit operation at various flight phases. All V-speeds are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">indicated airspeeds</a>¹.</p>

<p>The $V_{MO}$ is the maximum permitted speed for the aircraft. This includes a safety margin, so pilots can reasonably fly near that speed. Exceeding it is not immediately dangerous, but as it reduces safety margins, is an incident that should be investigated.</p>

<p>There is another speed, $V_{NE}$, the “never exceed speed”, which is somewhat higher and which marks the point where things start to get dangerous. When the aircraft exceeds $V_{NE}$, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter"" rel=""nofollow"">aeroelastic flutter</a> may develop that will destroy the aircraft and/or important parts may break off as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">dynamic pressure</a> becomes higher than what they are designed for.</p>

<p>Also these speeds have their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number"" rel=""nofollow"">Mach number</a> counterparts², $M_{MO}$ and $M_{NE}$. At high altitude, the same indicated airspeed (IAS) corresponds to much higher true air-speed, since indicated airspeed decreases with pressure, while the same Mach number corresponds to slightly lower true air-speed, since speed of sound only depends on temperature. So at high altitudes, the Mach limits are reached first while at low altitudes the IAS limits are.</p>

<p>Exceeding the $M_{NE}$ has different effect, though also dangerous. Above that speed flow separation occurs above the wing due to supersonic speed of the flow. This leads to loss of lift and significant down-pitching moment (a.k.a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_tuck"" rel=""nofollow"">mach tuck</a>), which aircraft not designed for supersonic flight may not have enough elevator authority to compensate.</p>

<hr>

<p>¹ The airspeeds are given as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">IAS</a>, the speed measured by pitot probes, so they can be directly compared to the indication in cockpit (aircraft with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_flight_instrument_system"" rel=""nofollow"">EFIS</a> (“glass cockpit”) usually correct those measurement errors that can be estimated, showing so called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibrated_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">calibrated airspeed (CAS)</a>). However it may not be just a simple number but may be tabulated depending on other parameters.</p>

<p>In particular $V_{NE}$ and $V_{MO}$ may depend on altitude, because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter"" rel=""nofollow"">flutter</a> depends on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">true airspeed (TAS)</a> and at lower density (due to lower pressure at altitude) the same TAS corresponds to lower <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">EAS</a>/<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibrated_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">CAS</a>/<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed"" rel=""nofollow"">IAS</a>.</p>

<p>² Mach number is true airspeed as fraction of speed of sound. In this case the limiting factor is formation of shockwaves due to the flow speed locally exceeding speed of sound around some parts of the aircraft.</p>

Let me see if I can explain it better.</p>

<p>First, the two easy questions, which were answered well by other questions, but I'll include here as well for completeness:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Could the shuttle perform a go-around?</strong> No. The OMS engines are too weak to make a difference in the atmosphere, and the main engines (which <em>would</em> be powerful enough) are only fueled by the orange external tank which is jettisoned after launch.</li>
<li><strong>Where did it land?</strong> 78 missions landed at the Kennedy Space Center, 54 (including the first) at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base"" rel=""noreferrer"">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, and 1 at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Space_Harbor"" rel=""noreferrer"">White Sands</a>. There were other landing sites designated for emergencies, but none were ever used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, for the <em>really</em> big question of how the shuttle reentered and landed.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2>Orbital Mechanics</h2>

<p>First, a <em>real quick</em> lesson in orbital mechanics. In order to change the altitude of your orbit you make a change in velocity ($\Delta v$). If you increase velocity, you'll increase altitude, and if you decrease velocity, you'll decrease altitude. However, this effect is most pronounced 180° from the position where you made the change. After a complete 360° orbit, you'll be at approximately the same altitude you started at.</p>

<p>This illustrates the effect:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vHwzo.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vHwzo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Starting from the circular orbit (black), if you slow down at point A, you might end up with something like the red orbit, and if you speed up you might end up with something like the blue orbit.</p>

<h2>Deorbit Burn</h2>

<p>Because of the nature of orbital mechanics, as described above, you want to perform your deorbit maneuver on the opposite side of the planet from your intended landing site. This typically occurred over the Indian Ocean for a landing at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>

<p>The burn itself was performed with the shuttle flying tail first and white (top) side facing towards the Earth (heat shield/black side facing towards space). The two OMS (orbital maneuvering system) engines were used to accomplish the required $\Delta v$ (anywhere between 200 and 550 ft/sec depending on the starting altitude). The burn typically took around 2.5 to 3 minutes. This would lower the perigee (lowest point in an orbit around Earth) to within a few miles of the ground (having a hard time finding a source, but I seem to remember it being around 30-40 miles), which was enough to ensure the orbital path would take them into thick atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5HiZ.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5HiZ.png"" alt=""""></a> <sup><a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:STS-116_Shuttle_Engines.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Image Source</a></sup></p>

<p>The OMS engines are essentially larger versions of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system"" rel=""noreferrer"">RCS</a> (reaction control system) jets. RCS jets were used for rotation (attitude) and small translation (velocity in a given direction) changes. The OMS were used for making orbital changes.</p>

<p>Both systems burned the same <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant"" rel=""noreferrer"">hypergolic</a> mixture (monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4)). If the OMS had failed, the RCS jets could have, in theory, been used to slow the shuttle enough for reentry.</p>

<h2>Nose Flip</h2>

<p>Some answers have said that the orbiter would pitch <em>down</em> 140° for the flip. This is incorrect. After the deorbit maneuver was completed, the orbiter would pitch <em>up</em> about 220° until it reached a 40° nose-up angle of attack (referred to as the ""EI -5 attitude"" because they must be in that attitude by at least five minutes prior to entry interface).</p>

<p>They have about 20 minutes between the deorbit burn and EI-5, so there's plenty of time to pitch in either direction. Nose <em>up</em> was likely preferred because the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit#Spacecraft"" rel=""noreferrer"">APU</a> exhaust vents point up near the tail. This naturally causes the orbiter to want to pitch up when the APUs are running.</p>

<p>During this pitch-up, they would fire the <em>forward</em> RCS jets to dump all the forward fuel, unless it was required for center-of-gravity reasons. The forward RCS jets weren't used during reentry, and dumping the fuel reduces potential hazards to the astronauts.</p>

<p>Once in position, open-loop entry guidance would begin, holding the orbiter at 0° roll (wings level), 0° yaw, and 40° angle of attack (alpha).</p>

<h2>Entry Interface</h2>

<p>NASA defines the entry-interface (EI) as an altitude of 400,000 feet. There's no hard-edge to the atmosphere, but this is around the altitude where its effects start to become directly detectable.</p>

<h2>S-Turns</h2>

<p>Some answers have claimed that the shuttle used S-turns for the purpose of slowing down. This is a very common, but over-simplified and arguably inaccurate, explanation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As with any airplane, the shuttle's wings generate lift. As the atmosphere gets denser, the wings are going to generate more lift, and this upward lift will cause the descent rate to slow. In fact if the shuttle maintained a wings-level attitude, it would eventually start to <em>gain</em> altitude causing it to ""skip"" across the atmosphere several times until it was slow enough to fall through. And while technically a skipping reentry would be possible, it would be very difficult to control with any precision.</p>

<p>So, instead, when the decent rate starts to slow, the shuttle goes into a bank. By controlling the bank angle, they're able to control how much upward lift the wings are generating, and, by extension, control their descent rate.</p>

<sup><em>ETAGW Figure 2-5 illustrating lift vector.</em></sup></p>

<p>Or course, with the lift vector pointed sideways instead of upwards, the shuttle is going to start to turn. Due to the incredible speed, the turn radius is enormous, but it does gradually turn nonetheless, and the orbiter develops an azimuth error (the difference between the orbiter's current direction and the direction to the landing site).</p>

<sup><em>ETAGW Figure 2-3 illustrating azimuth error.</em></sup></p>

<p>To correct this azimuth error ($\Delta z$), the orbiter performs ""roll reversals"". In other words, it turns in the other direction. These turns create the distinctive S-turn reentry track.</p>

<p>The first reversal always occurs at 10.5° $\Delta z$. Subsequent reversals occur at 17.5° until Mach 4 when it starts ramping down to 10° at Mach 3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: all mach numbers given anywhere in this answer, or referenced anywhere in Space Shuttle materials, aren't true mach numbers. NASA uses 1000 ft/sec as an approximation of Mach 1, and all mach numbers are multiples of that velocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Ranging</h2>

<p>Obviously, the ultimate goal of reentry is to reach your intended runway at an appropriate speed for landing. While the orbiter doesn't have any engines to help accomplish this, it does have a tremendous amount of orbital energy. Therefore the goal becomes energy management, and more specifically, drag management.</p>

<p>The orbiter has two ways to affect drag during entry: changing angle of attack (alpha), and changing bank angle.</p>

<p>Angle of attack is the quickest way to increase or decrease drag, but the orbiter was only allowed to deviate ±3° from the nominal alpha (40° for most of entry). This is the ""very small alpha envelope"" referred to earlier. The limitation is designed to ensure proper heat protection and maintain vehicle control.</p>

<p>Changing bank angle, as described above, allows you to control your descent rate. A steeper bank angle will result in reaching thicker air faster, and will therefore result in increased drag. A shallower bank angle will keep the orbiter in thinner air for longer, and result in less drag. However, it takes a little longer to see the effect of a bank change than an alpha change.</p>

<p>There are also bank angle limitations because, again, you don't want to skip out of the atmosphere, and you don't want to fall into thick air so fast that it exceeds the maximum drag the vehicle can handle, but it is a larger envelope than the alpha limits. In fact, in early stages of entry, the orbiter could have even flown upside down (with its lift vector pointed towards Earth) if necessary due to an under-burn as the result of a malfunction during the deorbit burn.</p>

<h2>Entry Guidance Phases</h2>

<p>I'm not going to go into detail about entry guidance, but I will say that the primary considerations change as speed and altitude changes, and the entry guidance is broken up into phases to reflect this.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJb90.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJb90.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup><em>ETAGW</em></sup></p>

<p>In the chart above, the middle line represents the nominal profile. The lowest line is the ""equilibrium glide"" profile which is the minimum amount of drag that the orbiter must maintain to avoid gaining altitude and skipping. The line at the top left represents a thermal limit (if the orbiter exceeds it, it might burn up). The line at the upper right represents a dynamic pressure limit (if the orbiter exceeds it, it might break up due to aerodynamic forces).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Preentry</strong>: This is considered open-loop guidance because all it does it maintain 0° yaw, 0° roll, and 40° alpha until the total load factor becomes 0.132g (approximately 3 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> of drag), at which point closed-loop guidance begins.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Control</strong>: Begins at closed loop guidance and ends at a velocity of Mach 19. Tries to maintain a constant temperature within the design limits of the orbiter.</li>
<li><strong>Equilibrium Glide</strong>: Simply provides a bridge between temperature control and constant drag phases. It ends when drag reaches 33 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>. It's named as such because its shape is similar to that of the equilibrium glide profile.</li>
<li><strong>Constant Drag</strong>: Maintains a constant drag rate of 33 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> until velocity reaches Mach 10.5.</li>
<li><strong>Transition</strong>: Designed to transition from the high drag and high alpha of entry to the lower drag and lower alpha required for the orbiter to fly more like an airplane. This phase terminates at Mach 2.5 when TAEM begins.</li>
</ol>

<h2>TAEM</h2>

<p>TAEM stands for Terminal Area Energy Management. The objective in this stage is to get the orbiter lined up with the runway with the correct amount of energy to make its final approach. Again, I'm not going to go into a ton of detail (feel free to ask other questions if you want), but here's the gist:</p>

<p>If all went well in the entry stage, TAEM will begin at about 82,000 feet and 60 nautical miles from the runway (intended ground track, not straight-line distance).</p>

<p>Whereas Entry guidance primarily uses bank angle to manage energy, TAEM primarily uses angle of attack. Below Mach 1, the speedbrake (a split rudder) also helps with energy management.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UyyU5.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UyyU5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>

<p>Phases of TAEM:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>S-Turn</strong>: Usually not required, but the shuttle will perform S-turns if it is too high on energy at the start of TAEM (too high, or too close to the runway).</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: Turns the orbiter towards a point of tangency on the heading alignment cone (HAC) and then flys wings-level until it intercepts the HAC. The tangency point is referred to as ""waypoint 1"" (WP1). During this phase, the orbiter slows to below Mach 1, at which point the commander takes CSS (control-stick steering), which is the closest thing the shuttle has to a ""manual"" mode.</li>
<li><strong>Heading Alignment</strong>: Guides the orbiter around a virtual ""cone"" (see diagram below) until it is in alignment with the runway. It's not <em>really</em> a cone, mathematically speaking, but it's the easiest way to visualize it.</li>
<li><strong>Prefinal</strong>: Establishes the orbiter on the outer glide slope.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFbtJ.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFbtJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup><em>ETAGW Figure 3-13 illustrating the HAC.</em></sup></p>

<h2>Approach and Landing</h2>

<p>The final guidance phase is called ""Approach and Landing"". It begins when the orbiter is below 10,000 feet and established on the outer glide slope (OGS), but no later than 5000 feet regardless of glide slope.</p>

<p>The OGS was a 20° glide slope for ""light"" orbiters (gross weight less than 222,000 pounds) or 18° for ""heavy"" orbiters (by comparison, normal airplanes use a 3° glide slope). Heavy or light depended on what was in the payload bay. The nominal aim point for the OGS was 7500 feet short of the runway threshold, but there was also a ""close-in"" aim point at 6500 feet which was used in the event of a strong enough headwind.</p>

<p>The speed brake was used to maintain 300 KEAS (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_airspeed"" rel=""noreferrer"">knots equivalent airspeed</a> - it's effectively the same as indicated airspeed) on the OGS until 3000 feet, at which time it calculated how much speed brake should be required for landing, and moved to that position. It would re-calculate once more at 500 feet.</p>

<p>At 2000 feet, the orbiter would begin a ""preflare"" maneuver designed to transition from the OGS to the shallow 1.5° inner glide slope (IGS). This was accomplished with a circular pull-up followed by an exponential decay onto the IGS.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vcirr.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vcirr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup><em>ETAGW Figure 4-8 illustrating the preflare geometry.</em></sup></p>

<p>In reality, the IGS is not followed for long, and is more of a guide for making sure you cross the runway threshold on the proper trajectory and get into position to begin the final flare, which is essentially the same as a conventional landing flare in a normal aircraft, except that the shuttle lands at a much higher angle of attack (about 8°) due to its delta wings (more similar to Concorde).</p>

<p>Landing gear was deployed at 300 feet, and if you're interested in landing gear, I wrote a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1109/did-the-space-shuttle-really-wait-until-50-feet-above-the-ground-before-they-put/1126#1126"">whole answer on landing gear deployment</a> once.</p>

<p>The targeted touchdown point was 2500 feet down the runway at an airspeed of 195 knots for light orbiters, or 205 knots for heavy (within +5/-10 knots).</p>

<p>The drag chute (an addition made in the early 90's) would be deployed shortly after main gear touchdown, but not faster than 195 knots, and sometimes they would wait until nose gear touchdown if there was a crosswind. It would be jettisoned at 60 knots to ensure the chute attachment mechanism didn't hit and damage the main engines.</p>

<h2>Control</h2>

<p>(e.g. how was the shuttle able to make attitude changes?)</p>

<p>In early entry, the orbiter is still controlled like a spacecraft, using RCS jets to control attitude. As dynamic pressure (q-bar) increases, the aerodynamic surfaces begin to become active and the RCS jets shutdown as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>q-bar = 0.5 pounds/ft<sup>2</sup> (psf), the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevon"" rel=""noreferrer"">elevons</a> begin to act as trim.</li>
<li>q-bar = 2 psf, elevons begin to act as active control surfaces.</li>
<li>q-bar = 10 psf, RCS roll jets are disabled.</li>
<li>q-bar = 40 psf, RCS pitch jets are disabled.</li>
<li>Mach 10, the speedbrake opens on a pre-programmed schedule to act as pitch trim.</li>
<li>Mach 5, rudder becomes active, initially acting primarily as aileron trim.</li>
<li>Mach 1, RCS yaw jets are disabled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>(e.g. how did the shuttle know where it was at?)</p>

<p>Navigation, in NASA terms, basically means knowing where you are (guidance answers the question ""how do I get where I want to go?""). During entry, the shuttle primarily used <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system"" rel=""noreferrer"">inertial navigation units</a>, which were aligned using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_tracker"" rel=""noreferrer"">star tracker</a> prior to the deorbit burn. As it got closer to the landing site it could also incorporate GPS and/or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_air_navigation_system"" rel=""noreferrer"">TACAN</a> signals into the nav data. OV-105 (aka Space Shuttle Endeavor) had a three GPS units installed and no TACANs, whereas the other orbiters had three TACANs and one GPS unit.</p>

<p>On the HAC, anywhere from about 15k to 20k feet in altitude, the orbiter would pick up the microwave landing system (MLS), which acts sort of like a very high precision ILS. From this, they're able to determine their position with high precision and accuracy. Once acquired, this becomes the primary source of nav data for the remainder of the flight.</p>

<p>On landing videos, you can actually see exactly when they pick up MLS because the altitude tape goes from being sort of jerky, then jumps a little bit and becomes smooth. For example, <a href=""https://youtu.be/KBTqtZIGV6U?t=28m28s"" rel=""noreferrer"">watch here</a> at about the 20k mark (altitude tape is the one on the right).</p>

<p>Below 5000 feet, the orbiter was also able to use a radar altimeter for altitude information.</p>

"What dictates the aspect ratio of an aircraft's wing?","13601","","<p>When designing an aircraft, there has to be a decision as to the aspect ratio of a wing. It's been said that having a higher aspect wing will reduce drag for the same wing area, however most of the time wings are shorter than they can be. So my question is, what exactly dictates the aspect ratio of a wing, and why don't they make them as long as possible?</p>
","<p><strong>Aspect ratio</strong> is the ratio based on the span and chord of an aircraft's wings. The <em>span</em> is the length of the wings measured wingtip to wingtip; the <em>chord</em> is the 'depth' of the wing from the leading edge to the trailing edge, measured in a straight line.</p>

<p>Because very few aircraft have constant chord planforms, this requires a not-very-fancy formula to calculate (<a href=""http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/geom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">source: NASA</a>), so that we can effectively average the chord:</p>

<p>$$AR=\frac{b^2}{S}$$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>$AR=$ Aspect ratio</p>

<p>$B=$ Wingspan</p>

<p>$S=$ Wing's area</p>

<p>Math aside, aspect ratio is chosen based on an aircraft's role or requirements. A need for agility dictates a low aspect ratio, as does a need for compactness. In both cases, fighter aircraft and bush aircraft benefit from agility and small size. High aspect ratios provide great cruise efficiency but can have poor landing characteristics (high drag at low speeds or high angles of attack due to frontal area) that are often offset by high-lift devices like flaps and slats.  </p>

<p>To the second half of your question: even when a high aspect ratio is desired, wings are not made as long as possible for two reasons. </p>

<p>The first is structural; the bending forces associated with wings of extreme length are, well, extreme, and the materials required are pretty space-age. See high-performance gliders, or at the crazy end, solar- or human-powered aircraft, for examples of this. It's just hard to do at the size of an airliner. </p>

<p>The second reason is more practical: space is expensive. An extremely high-aspect ratio wing takes up a ton of space relative to the rest of the aircraft. In an attempt to offset this, early 777s (which had a larger span than 767s and 747s) were offered with folding wingtips, but nobody bought that option and it got dropped.</p>

"Why do aircraft models end their life as freighters?","13590","","<p>There seems to be a tendency that aircraft models are more long-lived for cargo than for passenger service.</p>

<p>For example, both the A300 and MD-11 are all but extinct in scheduled passenger service, but FedEx and UPS still fly scores of them.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the reason an aircraft model goes out of service is not that the planes are too old to possibly continue flying, but that it becomes economically favorable to replace them with newer models with better fuel or maintenance economy etc. Shouldn't those considerations apply with equal strength to cargo planes?</p>

<p>Which factors contribute to passenger aircraft obsolescence <strong>that do not apply equally well to freight</strong>?</p>
","<p>Passenger operations are overwhelmingly scheduled whereas cargo is on demand and thus less easy to plan. The upside: A cargo plane crew will fly quite diverse routes. The downside: Capacity utilisation is worse. This shifts the balance of cost such that fixed cost must be lower than what is possible with scheduled services. As a consequence, older aircraft with lower depreciation cost are preferred. With them it is less costly if they don't move for some hours or even days.</p>

<p><sub>Caveat: Integrators (freight companies which ship door-to-door like FedEx or UPS) run their freighter fleet like a scheduled service, but still their utilisation is lower. Please see @TomMcW's answer for a detailed analysis.</sub></p>

<p>Operating cost are more important when the aircraft flies as much as technically possible. Especially low cost airlines need to operate hardware with the lowest operating cost possible so they survive the next price war. Premium airlines also have a need for the newest planes: This makes them look premium and more safe. Cargo operators have no such incentive to prefer the newest airplanes; they profit from the need of passenger airlines to sell their older hardware off.</p>

<p><sub>Next caveat: Older airplanes are at least as reliable as new ones when maintained well. The need of premium airlines for newer planes is only to impress their ignorant customers, not to increase real reliability numbers.</sub></p>

<p>The Economist wrote in April 2013 about Norwegian Air Shuttle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As fuel prices soared in the mid-2000s, and competition from the likes
  of Ryanair and easyJet intensified, Mr Kjos realised that the only
  route to survival was to buy lots of new, fuel-efficient planes to
  achieve economies of scale, and to base some of them in cheaper
  countries. Boeing and Airbus are straining to keep up with booming
  demand for new aircraft, so by reserving a large chunk of their
  delivery slots NAS is denying potential rivals the chance to refresh
  their fleets with better planes.</p>

<p>If an airline is large enough, ordering new aircraft has the added benefit of saturating supply and denying the same aircraft to its competitors. If oil prices are high, this airline will have won the price war before it started in earnest.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Remember your body still has roughly the same momentum it did when it was in the vehicle - just because you jumped out doesn't mean you're not still moving forward at a rate of speed the human body simply isn't designed for.</p>

<p>Let's reframe your question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you were in a car doing 60 miles per hour and you knew the car was about to crash into a brick wall, would you jump from the vehicle, or would you remain strapped into your seat where the car, seat, seatbelt, and airbag will all help absorb the impact?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with a car, being inside an aircraft and properly restrained will afford you substantial protection from the initial impact, and some of the crash energy will be absorbed damaging the aircraft. That increases the length of time it takes to decelerate your body and gives you a better chance of survival.  </p>

<p>If you jumped out of your friend's Cessna because it's going down and might hit some trees your unrestrained body would be decelerated far more abruptly when <em>you</em> hit the trees (or the ground).<br>
You might survive, but you've lessened your chances considerably (and the Cessna is a best-case scenario - your forward speed would be around 60mph as in the car example.

"How dangerous was the turbulence on this commercial flight?","13503","","<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Having read these great answers I feel a little ashamed for the fear I felt on this recent flight. However, judging by my reaction to the experience and the reaction of those around me on the flight I imagine I am not the only one who felt this way. As others have mentioned here I will agree that passengers are pretty bad at judging turbulence. For those who come to this Stack Exchange site with similar concerns, I hope that you read these answers from those knowledgeable in the field to assuage your concerns.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was recently on a flight that flew in to central Texas coming from Denver. There was bad turbulence on the flight in the last 45 minutes -- the worst I have ever experienced -- and I was curious about what else was going on behind the scenes from the perspective of the pilot and crew.</p>

<p>I do not know the airplane model. It has ~38 rows and 3 seats on each side of the aisle. I was in row 35. It was a standard commercial airplane that would fly across the United States.</p>

<p>We were first told that we were about to enter a turbulent area based on reports of other airliners in the region. We soon entered an area of lightning and dense clouds so thick that there was no visibility outside the windows. </p>

<p>The first drop came unexpectedly in what I can only describe as similar to a bad, bumpy landing on the freeway. The bags rattled pretty hard and loudly and I felt myself leave the seat. It was loud and jarring enough for most of the people in my area to scream out loud. Over the next 45 minutes, these drops happened continuously and randomly, up to 15 times. </p>

<p>Between these big drops the plane felt like it was swaying from the left and right. There were also many tiny dips between the bigger dips. It was extremely tense for everyone on the plane and generally it felt very uneven below us so there was a constant anticipation of another drop.</p>

<p>After the landing gear went down, it was clear that we were ascending again. The pilot explained that there was a ""spacing"" issue on the ground so he was going to fly around and try to land again. The guy next to me said (jokingly?) that this meant the pilot was too scared to land. </p>

<p>The cabin crew looked pretty terrified, and they were chatting to each other throughout the whole ordeal. People were sobbing and weeping all around me and they would yell every time a drop happened.</p>

<p>Obviously, you have little information to go off of but I was curious, from what I have provided, about the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many people on board were fairly traumatized by the experience. Was there any real danger from turbulence this bad? Is this something a pilot might encounter routinely that they would be equipped to handle or does this seem unusually bad?</p></li>
<li><p>What was happening behind the scenes? How does a pilot handle a situation like this? Was there other information about the turbulence that we were not being told?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any other interesting, related information to give me insight into this experience would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>Very little to go on (non-pilots are lousy at classifying turbulence) but my best guess is that you experienced <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/12117/do-we-have-a-unit-to-measure-turbulence"">moderate turbulence</a>. </p>

<p>If it was severe, your description would have been something more like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I couldn't focus my eyes to see. Someone who wasn't belted down was
  flung violently against the ceiling, then slammed to the floor. The
  captain was very assertive, telling the FAs to be seated immediately and
  that all passengers must strap in. The flight attendants wedged the
  service carts into the gaps between the seats and asked some
  passengers to hold them down, before sitting down and securing
  themselves in with their full 4 point harness. During the worst of it, there was no way anyone would have been able to stand, even if you were holding onto the seats or walls. Some overhead bins
  popped open strewing their
  contents about the cabin. There was coffee, cups, plastic glasses,
  books, etc. flying around EVERYWHERE. Several
  people had to be taken off the plane by stretcher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pilots are not ""scared to land"". If it's not safe, they will divert. If the approach is wrong, they will ""go around"" (both perfectly normal) and spacing issues are the most likely reason. Why would the captain lie? </p>

<p><a href=""http://askthepilot.com/questionanswers/turbulence"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ask a pilot.</a></p>

<p>The reaction of passengers is not a good indicator of the level of turbulence but the bottom line is, aircraft are designed to cope with the worst turbulence, and then some. You were perfectly safe.</p>

<p>I have to take issue with your use of ""air hostesses"", I believe you mean ""cabin crew"" or ""flight attendants"".  We stopped calling them that when we realised that they are actually professionals with a vital safety role as their primary function and are of both genders. </p>

"What is ""clearance delivery"" meant for?","13452","","<p>I was recently having a conversation where the term ""clearance delivery"" popped up, and was talking about his time flying into PHX, but in all of my time flying, I've never heard of the term before! Could someone explain to me what exactly is this for, and where would you find this?</p>
","<p>""Clearance Delivery"" is exactly what you've surmised it is - a frequency used on the ground to copy your initial clearance from ATC before you take off.<br>
The idea behind using a dedicated frequency for this is that it avoids tying up the ground control frequency (used for authorizing ground movement on taxiways and such) with long clearances and readbacks.</p>

<p>Clearance Delivery is found at controlled fields. Pilots operating under Instrument Flight Rules will generally use it prior to each flight, and at airfields in class C or class B airspace it's used by VFR pilots as well (since they'll be talking to departure controllers very shortly after take off until clear of the controlled airspace).  </p>

<p>At less busy fields Clearance Delivery is often staffed by the same controller working Ground (e.g. at <a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/KISP"">Long Island / Mac Arthur</a> it's usually the same controller working both positions), and at some airports clearances will be read over the ground control frequency when it's not busy. At busier airports clearance is usually its own position - possibly with multiple frequencies (e.g. at <a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/lga"">La Guardia</a> there is a separate clearance frequency for helicopters).</p>

"How do conventional and T-tails differ?","13415","","<p>What design considerations go into the decision between conventional tails and T-tails?  Functionally the horizontal stabilizer/stabilator are the same in both cases, providing negative lift, the elevator control and a method for pitch trim.  What are the differences though?  </p>

<p>As far as I am aware the T-tails I have flown have T-tails for avoiding propwash (PA-44) or aft engine placement (EMB-145).  Are there other reasons for having a T-tail?  What are the aerodynamic consequences a pilot needs to be aware of with a T-tail (e.g. avoiding hard de-rotation on touchdown, issues at high AOA, etc)?</p>
","<p>There is more to a T-tail than that:</p>

<p>Aerodynamics:</p>

<ol>
<li>The placement on top of the vertical gives it more leverage,
especially with a swept tail.</li>
<li>Depending on wing location, it stays in undisturbed flow in a stall. Note: This is really depending on the details, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_Flugzeugbau_HFB-320_Hansa_Jet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HFB-320</a> had a forward swept wing and a T-tail, which made a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8022/what-is-a-deep-stall-and-how-can-pilots-recover-from-it/8027#8027"">deep stall</a> possible (and in one case fatal).</li>
<li>By designing the junction with the vertical well, the T-tail has less interference drag. It also helps to reduce wave drag, especially when using a well designed Küchemann body (the round, long, spiky thing on the tail junction of a Tu-154) by stretching the structure lengthwise.</li>
<li>It can help to increase the effectiveness of the vertical tail by keeping the   air on both sides of it separated. At the other end, the fuselage does this already, so moving the horizontal tail up does not hurt so much there. As a consequence, the tail can be built lower.</li>
</ol>

<p>Structure:</p>

<ol>
<li>The mass of the horizontal tail on a long lever arm (= the vertical tail) means that the torsional eigenfrequency of the fuselage will go down. This might be a problem in case of flutter.</li>
<li>As a consequence of the smaller vertical tail, a T-tail can be lighter. Note that the increased leverage means that the horizontal tail can be smaller as well. This reduces friction drag and is the main reason why most modern gliders have T-tails.</li>
</ol>

<p>Control:</p>

<p>A T-tail produces a strong nose-down pitching moment in sideslip.</p>

<p>If it were not for the flutter and pitch-down, T-tails would be more widespread ...</p>

"Why does an airplane captain sit in the left seat?","13415","","<p>For almost every airline, the captain sits in the left seat, and the first officer on the right.</p>

<ol>
<li>We know that in most countries <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic"">right-side traffic and some have left-side</a>.</li>
<li>During training, the student sits in the left seat, and the trainer on the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping these two points in mind, why does the captain always sits on left? It is not based on culture (see #1 above), and not on who has more experience<sup>1</sup> to fly an airplane from both seats.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>: I know that there can be a situation when the first officer is more experienced than the captain, but most of the time, it is not the case.</p>
","<p>There are several reasons, mostly historical, or theories behind this:</p>

<ul>
<li>After World War I, most airplanes had rotary engines with left turning tendencies because it followed the torque of the engine. Therefore, turning left was easier than turning right. Because of this, pilots considered left turns as more convenient maneuver, and thus more experienced pilot started sitting on the left.</li>
<li>Since the early days of aviation, the fact that pilot was sitting on the left, they keep the airplane on the right side along the airway. At that time, pilots often navigate visually following roads and railways. Opposite traffic following the same path then pass each other on the left.</li>
<li>Because captain sits on the left, left-hand traffic patterns are more common.</li>
<li>In order to avoid a head-on collision, each airplane must turn right. Since the captain sits on the left, they will have an unrestricted view of the other airplane, and therefore can assess the situation easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>In modern times, almost all airplanes (other than single-pilot airplanes or where one pilot sits behind the other), both seats have full controls to fly the airplane.</p>

<p>Regulations do not specify which seat should be occupied by the pilot-in-command (PIC) or the Pilot Flying (PF).</p>

<p>Please note that <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8177/why-is-the-pic-position-for-helicopters-the-right-seat-rather-than-the-left-sea"">on many helicopters, captains sit on the right side</a>.</p>

<p>I know the inner space of the plane used for passengers and crew is sealed and the pressure is maintained within some range.</p>

<p>However in standard flight altitude of about 10-14 km there is not enough oxygen to breathe.  I am not sure whether the standard oxygen ratio is still about 21% and you only have less air (lower pressure).</p>

"Why do pilots use airways instead of just ""flying direct"" every time?","13279","","<p>These days, on larger/newer aircraft at least, it seems like GPS navigation is pretty much ubiquitous.  So it doesn't seem like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range"">VOR</a>s and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon"">Non-directional Beacons</a> (NDBs) would really get a lot of usage and, as I recall, the reason we have airways is because they were the connection points between VORs and NDBs, right?</p>

<p>Nowadays it seems like a pilot could ""fly direct"" (go directly from one airport to the other without using any intermediary checkpoints) really very easily.  And yet I've been told on several occasions that most pilots use airways.  </p>

<p>Why is that? Why do pilots use airways instead of flying direct every time? </p>

<p>(Or am I wrong and everyone is flying direct and I'm being dumb?)</p>
","<p>Airways simply allow for better management of traffic.<br>
Imagine for a moment that everyone had an off-road capable car, if all the drivers were going ""GPS Direct"" to their destination how would drivers ensure separation? How would you avoid hitting other cars if there were no roads?</p>

<p>Airways are the aviation solution to this problem: Defined routes between navaids (VORs, NDBs, and the like). Airways can also be defined using ""fixes"" defined by GPS coordinates which can provide something closer to ""GPS Direct"" routing while still providing a defined route.</p>

<p>Airways also provide a bunch of other benefits, including:</p>

<p><strong>Traffic Flow Management</strong></p>

<p>Flightplans in Europe are validated by the <em><a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Central_Flow_Management_Unit_%28CFMU%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CFMU (Central Flow Management Unit)</a></em> and checked for criteria such as direction of airways (which can change during the day, e.g. one airway being for eastbound traffic only between 1000 UTC and 1400 UTC), correct flight level ranges and airways correctly connecting waypoints, such as fixes, VORs or NDBs. The bottleneck in all flight operations is understanding airport capacity (how many operations/hour) and sector capacity (how many aircraft handled per sector/per controller). The goal is sometimes to distribute traffic between two sectors, although having the same destination. Below you will find two routings to Düsseldorf - EDDL, one departing from <a href=""http://skyvector.com/?ll=51.41976382570769,7.536254885350317&amp;chart=304&amp;zoom=3&amp;plan=A.ED.EDDP:F.ED.ORTAG:F.ED.KUMER:F.ED.GOTGI:V.ED.WRB:F.ED.TINSA:F.ED.ADEMI:F.ED.INBAX:F.ED.DOMUX:A.ED.EDDL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leipzig - EDDP</a> and one from <a href=""http://skyvector.com/?ll=51.68958500713333,7.13452148690714&amp;chart=304&amp;zoom=3&amp;plan=A.ED.EDDT:F.ED.BRANE:F.ED.GUGSU:V.ED.HLZ:F.ED.PERIK:F.ED.PIROT:F.ED.DENOL:V.ED.HMM:F.ED.XAMOD:A.ED.EDDL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Berlin-Tegel - EDDT</a> (click on links to see visual representation):</p>

<pre><code>EDDP - EDDL
ORTAG Q230 WRB T854 DOMUX

EDDT - EDDL
BRANE Y200 HLZ T851 XAMOD
</code></pre>

<p>The routing from EDDP to EDDL is going via WRB - TINSA - ADEMI - INBAX - DOMUX, which is within the boundaries of a sector called <a href=""http://www.vacc-sag.org/download/sectorfile.php?id=229&amp;check=b9002078cf5fb0272bed17f1fc4ff324"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Paderborn High"" or PADH</a>.</p>

<p>The routing from EDDT to EDDL is going via PIROL - DENOT - HMM - XAMOD, which is within the boundaries of a sector called <a href=""http://www.vacc-sag.org/download/sectorfile.php?id=229&amp;check=b9002078cf5fb0272bed17f1fc4ff324"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Hamm High/Medium"" or HMMH/HMMM</a>.</p>

<p>During peak hours, both sectors are separate and deal with traffic only within their sector, which uses the full capacity of each controller handling the sector. Outside peak hours, the sectors can be combined and worked by one controller. This allows a granular usage of controller resources and airspace.</p>

<p><strong>Separation between Traffic</strong></p>

<p>From the example above we have seen that there is 2 routing endpoints at Düsseldorf - EDDL for traffic arriving from the North-East and South-East, XAMOD and DOMUX. Both waypoints or fixes are respective STAR or transition entry-points for arrivals into Düsseldorf. By using a standardized routing to and from airports, we can now expect traffic to always arrive via these two points from the east, unless other coordination has been achieved by the ATC units involved. Looking at the reverse routing for both airports, we will see these routes:</p>

<pre><code>EDDL - EDDP
NUDGO Z858 BERDI Z21 BIRKA T233 LUKOP

EDDL - EDDT
MEVEL L179 OSN L980 DLE T207 BATEL
</code></pre>

<p>MEVEL and NUDGO are two of the SID exit waypoints out of Düsseldorf, <a href=""http://skyvector.com/?ll=51.68969852167173,7.134521477726325&amp;chart=302&amp;zoom=3&amp;plan=F.ED.XAMOD:F.ED.MEVEL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MEVEL being 10nm north of XAMOD</a> and NUDGO being 26nm east of DOMUX, however the relevant fix here is ELBAL, which is one of the fixes on the SID23L from Düsseldorf to NUDGO, <a href=""http://skyvector.com/?ll=51.419649642834294,7.5362548761497585&amp;chart=302&amp;zoom=3&amp;plan=F.ED.DOMUX:F.ED.ELBAL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">which is 16nm south of NUDGO</a>. With something simple as using standardized entry and exit fixes to and from an airport, we have managed to maintain a traffic flow with ensured separation between departing and arriving traffic, something which would not be possible with GPS direct routing or would require constant ATC vectors.</p>

<p><strong>Handoffs from ATC Unit to ATC Unit</strong></p>

<p>The above examples show different routings and sometimes different sectors handling traffic on these routes. How is traffic handed off to other controllers and where? A handoff consists of moving the radar track of the aircraft from one controller to another and thereafter instructing the aircraft to change the frequency to the next sector controller. Handoffs are initiated at sector boundaries, at specific fixes, which have been agreed on between different ACC (Area Control Centers) or sometimes even within one ACC between single sectors. Since we are already familiar with Düsseldorf airspace, let's use the below routing from <a href=""http://skyvector.com/?ll=51.01663451649939,8.306396477685288&amp;chart=302&amp;zoom=3&amp;plan=A.ED.EDDM:F.ED.GIVMI:F.ED.ERNAS:F.ED.TALAL:F.ED.ERMEL:F.ED.INBED:F.ED.AMOSA:F.ED.IBAGA:F.ED.EDUDU:F.ED.OSBIT:F.ED.TEKTU:F.ED.SOGMI:F.ED.ARPEG:F.ED.BADGO:F.ED.ABILU:F.ED.ADEMI:F.ED.INBAX:F.ED.DOMUX:A.ED.EDDL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">München to Düsseldorf</a>.</p>

<pre><code>EDDM - EDDL
GIVMI Y101 TEKTU Z850 ADEMI T854 DOMUX
</code></pre>

<p>From the graphical represenation you will see that traffic from EDDM to EDDL will pass the waypoint ARPEG, which is close to the destination airport. Before reaching the waypoint ARPEG, aircraft will be under control of either the <a href=""http://www.vacc-sag.org/download/sectorfile.php?id=229&amp;check=b9002078cf5fb0272bed17f1fc4ff324"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hersfeld (HEF) or Gedern (GED) sector</a> (page 5) and need to descend towards the destination airport. The next sector for arriving traffic into Düsseldorf via ARPEG would be Paderborn High Sector (PADH). The agreements between HEF/GED and PADH are that arriving traffic to Düsseldorf via ARPEG is to be expected at FL240 level at ARPEG and released after handoff for further descent through PADH, even if the aircraft has not yet crossed the sector boundary and is not in PADH airspace. These coordination waypoints and handoff procedures are documented in Letters of Agreement between or within an ACC. </p>

<p><strong>Weather</strong></p>

<p>When weather (wrong-way lows, strong jetstreams, storms, etc) affects the Direct route, flight dispatchers will pro-actively suggest routes around it. It's not unusual for NYC-SFO traffic to be routed over Canada or over Kentucky when the Midwest is storming.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions - Free Route Airspace</strong></p>

<p>Where airport and air traffic density allows, the use of airways is not mandatory or in some cases, not even expected or provisioned for. One example is the <a href=""http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/article/files/2011march-free-route-airspace-maastricht.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Free Route Airspace overhead Scandinavia</a>, where a portion of airspace can be freely used between defined entry and exit points. Similar systems are also being discussed by <a href=""http://www.nats.aero/environment/consultations/pc-route-free-airspace/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NATS UK</a> and the  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_Air_Transportation_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAA NextGen Air Transportation System</a>.</p>

"Are wings any more efficient at creating lift, versus orienting the engine's thrust downwards?","13279","","<p>As I understood from <a href=""http://www.empiricalzeal.com/2012/10/12/can-we-build-a-more-efficient-airplane-not-really-says-physics"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>, wings on an airplane basically create lift by pushing air down.</p>

<p>Maintaining the lift force expends energy because air needs to be continually accelerated downwards. In the ""energy budget"" of the airplane, this energy cost appears in the form of extra drag due to the wing, which must be compensated by extra engine thrust.</p>

<p>It seems to me then that the power required to keep an airplane at a constant altitude using a wing is exactly equivalent to the power that would be needed if we would ""simply"" use a downwards-pointing fan instead of the wing.</p>

<p>Now, some posts on this website compare VTOL aircraft to airliners of similar size, and state that VTOL requires much more thrust (e.g. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/23799/what-are-the-reasons-why-we-do-not-have-vtol-commercial-airliners/23806#23806"">here</a> - I would post more links but I'm not allowed to). But according to the reasoning above, shouldn't it require exactly the same amount of power to put a plane in the air, whether using a wing or directing the engine thrust downwards? </p>

<p>Please disregard, for a moment, the technical difficulties and safety issues. They are discussed in other questions related to gimbal thrust and VTOL aircraft. My question has to do with energy expenditure and power.</p>
","<p>Interesting question. Purely empirically, it is the lift-to-drag ratio you are looking for. If you take this value as given for any particular aircraft, you have a direct answer for how much more effective wings are. It is the ratio of the lift to the total drag. The engine only needs to overcome the drag.</p>

<p>With L/D equal to unity you would need the same thrust as for the vertical take off. But even quite ""bad"" fixed wing aircraft would have L/D about 5. Gliders or similar aircraft built with a strong focus on aerodynamics can have an L/D of 50 or more (at least in some narrow range of airspeeds).</p>

<p>So yes, wings are more efficient. About one order of magnitude as a rule of thumb for common aircraft and optimal airspeed.</p>

<p>Why your reasoning with air pushed down is incorrect is more tricky to explain. I'll start with the assumption that, as air passes an airfoil, its speed relative to the airfoil is unaltered, and only the direction changes. (I know air slows down at least because of friction etc., but these are, at least theoretically, avoidable things not related directly to creating the lift. If there is something intrinsically related to lift which makes airflow change not only direction but speed too, then someone will hopefully correct me here.)
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u2Bz6.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u2Bz6.png"" alt=""velocity change over a airfoil""></a></p>

<p>See the image. Airmass moving initially towards the airfoil with velocity $\vec{v_0}$ is deflected down by angle $\alpha$. Therefore the change in the velocity is $\vec{\Delta v}$. This change can be divided into horizontal and vertical components. To hold the aircraft in the air, the vertical component has to be equivalent to the aircraft's weight divided by the mass flow rate over the wing. The vertical component is related to the horizontal by
$$
\Delta v_{\rm horiz}=\Delta v_{\rm vert} \cdot \tan{\alpha\over 2}.
$$</p>

<p>So, from this simplistic view, the drag would be $\tan\alpha/2$ times the lift. Higher mass flow rate over the wing (longer wings, higher airspeed) makes it possible to keep the same lift with lower deflection ($\alpha$), thus less drag due to the generated lift.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Additional comment: how is it related to power and energy</h3>

<p>The answer above is focused on how wings decrease necessary engine <em>thrust</em>, but original question could be interpreted in terms of energy efficiency too. I'll try to add some comments on this part.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>simple example &ndash; rocket engine: not too typical for aircraft, but simple one. Rocket consumes same amount of fuel per second in order to generate a unit of thurst regardless of its size and regardless if it is pointing upward (and is static with respect to air) or forward (and moving through the air). You need to burn proportionally more fuel per second to generate higher thrust. So, for the rocket propulsion, you will save fuel in the same ratio as the necessary thrust decreases.</p></li>
<li><p>Propeller or jet engines are more complicate as their thrust and fuel consumption depends on engine movement through the air too. As David K pointed out in his answer, we can use momentum and kinetic energy of accelerated air to get power needed for unit of thrust.</p>

<p>With some simplifications, thrust is mass flow rate through the engine/prop multiplied by change of flow speed it causes. $T = \dot m \cdot (v_{\rm out} - v_{\rm in}) = \dot m \Delta v$. Power needed for this is $P = \dot m \cdot {1\over2}(v_{\rm out}^2 - v_{\rm in}^2)=\dot m\Delta v\cdot(v_{\rm in} + {\Delta v\over 2})$. Thus
$$
{P\over T}=v_{\rm in} + {\Delta v\over 2}\,.
$$</p>

<p>For stationary engine holding against gravity, higher thrust compared to flying fixed wing aircraft is needed as shown above. If we do not ""cheat"" by increasing mass flow rate through engine (like making it helicopter rotor or using multiple engines), $\Delta v$ has to be increased in  order to achieve the necessary thrust. So you not only need more power because of increased thrust but also more power because of increased Watts per unit of thrust. Note that even ""helicopter cheat"" does not work too well. To match power consumption of engine generating less thrust thanks to the wing's L/D you need to improve P/T too &ndash; by decreasing $\Delta v$, thus increasing mass flow (rotor/propeller radius even more than proportionally to increased thrust).</p>

<p>What about decrease of P/T due to the movement through air? Well, it depends on particular engine and its $\Delta v$. It will be typically in similar order of magnitude as airspeed (or even less), so we can not neglect $v_{\rm in}$ in watts-per-thrust equation above. There is a efficiency penalty when engine works on moving aircraft. But it should be still worth of it as the gain provided by lift is greater.</p>

<p>A simplified example: We have an engine capable of producing enough thrust to lift aircraft vertically. It can be throttled by changing $\Delta v$ without any practical problems or change in its internal efficiency. And let's assume that mass flow rate through it is fixed area $S$ multiplied by air density and multiplied by arithmetical average of speeds of entering and exiting air. For hovering aircraft and stationary engine producing thrust equal to aircraft's weight, $w$ it is
$$w=\dot m \Delta v_{\rm hover} = \rho S \Delta v_{\rm hover}^2 / 2\,;\quad \Delta v_{\rm hover}=\sqrt{2 w \over \rho S}$$
and thus
$$P_{\rm hover}=w\cdot \Delta v_{\rm hover}/2=\sqrt{w^3\over 2\rho S}\,.$$</p>

<p>The same aircraft flying on its wings does only need $w\over L/D$ of thrust. Airspeed is $v_{\rm air}$. Equation for the thrust: ${w\over L/D} = \dot m \Delta v_{\rm flight} = \rho S \cdot (v_{\rm air}+{\Delta v_{\rm flight} \over 2}) \cdot \Delta v_{\rm flight}$. Thus
$$\Delta v_{\rm flight}=\sqrt{{2w\over(L/D)\rho S}+v_{\rm air}^2}-v_{\rm air}$$
and
$$
P_{\rm flight}={w\over L/D}\cdot(\sqrt{{w\over 2(L/D)\rho S}+{v_{\rm air}^2\over 4}}+{v_{\rm air}\over 2})\,.
$$</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not see any way how to simplify and compare $P_{\rm hover}$ and $P_{\rm flight}$ so some concrete numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Light aircraft, 1 ton, 100 knots, $S = 5\,\rm m^2$, $L/D = 15$: $P_{\rm hover} = 290\,\rm kW$, $P_{\rm flight} = 35\,\rm kW$.</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy aircraft, 100 ton, 200 knots, $S = 50\,\rm m^2$, $L/D = 15$: $P_{\rm hover} = 90\,\rm MW$, $P_{\rm flight} = 7\,\rm MW$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, based on these simplifications flying with wings with similar kind of engine should be significantly more efficient in energy terms too. And, additionally, you are already moving forward using power $P_{\rm flight}$. For vertical engine extra power would be necessary for overcoming air drag due to the movement.</p></li>

  <p>With an optimal arrangement and at high angles of attack, such vortex generators, which are known as nacelle <em>strakes</em> or <em>chines</em>, generate a powerful vortex that flows over the wing, where on a slat in front of said wing it delays airflow separation until the aircraft flies at greater angles of attack.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>DC-10 wind tunnel tests showed a significant loss in maximum lift
  coefficient in the flap deflected configurations, with landing slat
  extension, compared to predictions. This resulted in a stall speed
  increase of about 5 knots in the approach configuration. The initial
  wing stall occured behind the nacelles and forward of the inboard
  ailerons. The problem was traced by flow visualization techniques to the
  effects of the nacelle wake at high angles of attack and the absence of
  the slat in the vicinity of the nacelle pylons. The solution was
  developed in the NASA Ames Research Center 12 ft. pressurized tunnel and
  turned out to be a pair of strakes mounted forward on each side of the
  nacelles in planes about 45 degrees above the horizontal. The final
  strake shape was optimized in flight tests. The strakes are simply
  large vortex generators. The vortices mix the nacelle boundary layer air
  with the free stream and reduce the momentum loss in the wake. The
  vortices then pass just over the upper surface of the wing, continuing
  this mixing process. The counterrotating vortices also create a downwash
  over the wing region unprotected by the slat, further reducing the
  premature stall. The effect of the strakes is to reduce the required
  takeoff and landing field lengths by about 6%, a very large effect.</p>

"When are aircraft required to dump fuel for emergency landings?","13239","","<p>I've heard that in a lot of instances a jet that is making an emergency landing is required to dump excess fuel.  In a lot of instances this would make a lot of sense.  For example, if the gear cannot be lowered and the plane must land on its belly.   The last thing you want is a hundred tons of jet fuel involved.</p>

<p>But, I have to assume there are also emergencies where a plane isn't required to dump its fuel.  I just am not sure what they would be?</p>

<p>So, my question is: When are aircraft required to dump fuel before landing (or, at very least, when is it advisable to dump fuel before landing).</p>

<p>Bonus points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How much fuel does an aircraft retain after an emergency dump? I'm
assuming they don't dump it all or they would have no fuel to
maneuver with.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples would be great.</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>For many medium and large sized jets the maximum gross takeoff weight is higher than the maximum landing weight.  If the airplane has an emergency that requires an air return or other landing in the early part of flight, it is very likely overweight for landing.  The plane has 3 options at this point:</p>

<ol>
<li>Land overweight</li>
<li>Dump fuel (if able)</li>
<li>Fly around at low altitude and high power to burn fuel</li>
</ol>

<p>For some airplanes, option 2 is not available.  This includes airplanes that are not equipped to dump fuel (not all airplanes have this capability or have the capability under MEL) or are not approved to dump fuel at their current location and altitude.  For these airplanes, only option 1 and 3 are available.  </p>

<p>The choice between option 1 and 2/3 comes down to what kind of emergency it is.  If you have to be on the ground <strong>now</strong>, you won't care about being overweight, and will just put it down.  If you have time and landing now isn't a priority, then you would choose to dump or burn fuel.</p>

<p>If an airplane chooses to dump, they will generally choose one of two values of remaining fuel:</p>

<ol>
<li>fuel such that they land at the maximum landing weight</li>
<li>absolute minimum safe fuel to land</li>
</ol>

<p>This choice comes down to how likely the landing will end in an accident.  If you are sure the landing will be a non-event (e.g. air return for anti-ice failure) then you'll likely just dump until landing wont be overweight.  Conversely, if you have a control issue or something that may end badly, you want minimum fuel to lessen the potential for fire.  In these cases the ARFF crew will spray the runway with foam to assist in reducing the fire potential.  </p>

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/3m7QNCk.gif"" alt=""Aircraft seat survivability""></p>

<p>From a business perspective (and ignoring any ethical considerations of whether passengers should pay more for a better chance of survival), it would seem to me to make more sense to put your highest paying and likely most regular passengers in the safest part of the plane, the rear.
Yet almost exclusively they are placed in the front, the un-safest part.</p>

<p>So why are First/Business class seats in the un-safer front of the craft and not the safer rear?</p>
","<p>Farhan did an excellent job explaining the answer from a creature comfort perspective, but let me explain why from a the standpoint of safety and public perception of said safety.</p>

<p>Firstly, the difference between the front and the back isn't as stark as the red and green colors might imply.  As your graph shows, the survival rate in the front is 49%, and the rear is 69%, and while a 20% gap is significant, it's not like everyone in the front always dies and everyone in the rear always survives.  </p>

<p>Secondly, planes simply do not crash all that much, and most frequent fliers just aren't worried about dying in a plane crash, so they'd rather the convenience of the front of the airplane.</p>

<p>Thirdly, of those who are worried about dying in a crash, most of them are unaware of the fact they are 20% more likely to do so at the front of the craft.  Most people assume that if the plane crashes, they are just going to die.  Thus, they assume moving to another part of the airplane isn't going to help.  Thus, there isn't really any market demand to move 1st class seats to another location.</p>

<p>As a final thought, I think even knowing the stats, personally, I'd still rather be up front.  I've read of accidents where there were several people near the rear who survived the initial impact and then either <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123"">died from exposure</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Flight_801"">died from a spreading fire because they were too injured or weak to move</a>.

"Are the guns on a fighter jet fixed or can they be aimed?","13062","","<p>Are the (built-in) guns on fighter jets fixed, or can they be elevated up and down or panned right and left for aiming?</p>

<p>In other words are fighter jet guns aimed by pointing the whole aircraft at the target or can they be aimed independently?</p>
","<p>The guns of modern fighter jets are fixed to the airframe—they can't be moved in any direction; the pilot has to maneuver the aircraft to bring the guns to bear. The image shows the mounting of General Electric M61A1 Vulcan cannon in an F-16.</p>

<p>The pilot aims the guns using an optical representation in the Heads-Up Display (HUD). Some of the aircraft use the <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/786464.pdf"">Lead Computing Optical Sight</a> where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... a prediction angle is continually computed and displayed on the Heads Up Display (HUD) as a reticle offset from a fixed reference on the gunsight. ... (which) accounts for ballistic curvature, own motion, and predicted target motion.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, it shows where the shells will pass through at a certain distance. Some aircraft use <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/solohermelin/6-computing-gunsight-hud-and-hms"">Enhanced Envelope Gun Sight (EEGS)</a>. It basically shows a pair of lines which the cannon shells will follow- the lines moves as the aircraft maneuvers, showing the effect of the maneuver on the flight path (of the shell). The correct 'solution' exists when the wingtips of the target touches the funnel lines.</p>

","<p>According to my experience, you have two problems with props:</p>

<ol>
<li>Torque</li>
<li>Exhaust Speed</li>
</ol>

<p>If you use contra-rotating propellers, you eliminate the torque reaction problem because you now have two contra-rotating propellers each cancelling out the opposite's torque.</p>

<p>Also you increase the speed of air accelerated by the propellers, thus the aircraft’s efficiency at relatively high travelling speeds is increased.</p>

<p>Normally, the propeller can only be operated effectively at low Mach numbers and increasing the RPM above a certain point will only cause the air behind the propeller to compress but not accelerate. Using a second propeller with higher pitch angles can generate high enough airspeed without the problem of compression because the second propeller is rotating inside the airstream generated by the first propeller.</p>

<p>Correction
However, having a different speed and pitch WILL induce a torque effect.</p>

"Why are adjustable area jet engine nozzles mostly limited to military use?","13040","","<p>It seems that only jet engines with afterburners use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propelling_nozzle#Types_of_nozzle"">adjustable area nozzles</a> (this means adjusting the <a href=""http://youtu.be/x5ccK94IvsA?t=5m47s"">area</a> of the nozzle but <em>not</em> necessarily the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring"">direction</a>). This includes most fighter jets, as well as bombers like the B-1B and Tu-160. Outside of the military or afterburning engines, they don't seem to be used, even for smaller engines.</p>

<p>What is the reason for this? Is the Variable Area Fan Nozzle (VAFN) concept related?</p>

<p>Wikipedia explains that it is related to supersonic operation; I'm looking for a more detailed explanation about the reasons for this.</p>
","<p>A variable area nozzle helps to adjust the exit pressure of the combustion gases to ambient pressure. When they leave the turbine, the combustion gases have still some remaining pressure which is converted into speed by a convergent contour of the nozzle.</p>

<p>If the combustion gases have enough pressure to be accelerated to supersonic speed, the nozzle is actually first convergent and then divergent to achieve the best acceleration of the flow. The convergent, subsonic flow accelerates until in the section with the smallest area, called the throat, the speed of sound is reached, and the following divergent section accelerates the now supersonic flow further until its pressure drops to ambient pressure. This con-di-nozzle needs to adjust both the cross section of the throat and the cross section of the exit area. Failure to get especially the throat area right will mean substantial thrust loss in operation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ZX3F.png"" alt=""con-di nozzle""></p>

<p>Afterburning engines need adaptable nozzles due to the different operating conditions in dry and wet mode, so they profit the most from adjustable nozzles. Reheating the exhaust gas means to increase its volume, so the nozzle needs to become wider to be properly matched. In general, if the exit speed of the combustion gases is supersonic, an adjustable nozzle is required. Even some early jets without afterburners had an adjustable nozzle: The central cone of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Jumo_004"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jumo-004</a> nozzle could be moved fore and aft, which changed the location of the bulbous aft section, helping to get the throat area right. Note in the picture below that the cross section widens again in the last part of the nozzle, which shows that the exhaust stream of the Jumo engine was mildly supersonic.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GVNW9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Airliner engines would only gain little from an adjustable nozzle, and considering the mass increase of a fully adjustable nozzle, would in total have lower efficiency. Their exit speed is still subsonic - please note that the speed of sound in the heated combustion gas is much higher. At 500°C the speed of sound is almost 560 m/s.</p>

<p>The variable area fan nozzle tries to do for the fan flow what the regular nozzle does for the core flow of a jet. So this is indeed a related concept. The picture below is copied from the US patent 2011/0302907A1 and shows an adjustable end part of the cowling (crosshatched, 54). Even though the exit speed of the fan flow is subsonic, its mass flow is much higher than that of the core in airliner engines. By adjusting the exit pressure by varying the exit area it can squeeze out some performance gains.</p>

"How do airliners cross the ocean without GPS?","13029","","<p>How do airliners cross the ocean without GPS?</p>

<p>Do they use dead-reckoning or are there navigation aids floating out there?</p>
","<p>Well, most airlines <em>do</em> cross the ocean with GPS in today's world.</p>

<p>That being said, most (if not all) transcontinental airliners, and many flying domestic routes as well, have what's called an <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2275/what-is-an-inertial-navigation-system-how-does-it-work"">inertial navigation system</a> (a form of dead-reckoning where gyros and accelerometers are used to compute changes in position). The INS feeds into the flight management computer which is used to cross-check the GPS position, and can be used as a primary navigation source should the GPS signal be lost or corrupted.</p>

<p>Prior to GPS, inertial navigation was the primary means of navigating across oceans. However, a great many airplanes did cross oceans before INS... with varying success. The general idea was to use a combination of dead-reckoning, radio beacons where you can find them (small islands and coastlines), the sun (with the help of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sextant</a>) during the day, and the stars at night. Hopefully, this puts you in position after some period of time to pickup ground-based navigational aids, or to identify a coastline. This actually works pretty well if your wind estimates are good, and the margin for error is high enough. As DeltaLima points out, long-range radio navigation systems also started to emerge around World War II (LORAN and Decca) which had a much greater range than previous radio beacons, and therefore decreased the amount of time required to fly by dead-reckoning alone. By the time inertial navigation became prevalent in the 1970's, airlines were already providing reliable transcontinental passenger flights every day.</p>

<p>Another possible outcome is that your plane is lost in the ocean, never found, and the Discovery Channel funds an expedition to look for you 75 years later.</p>

<p>What distinguishes them? Is there an international standard that determines how aviation crashes are classified or is it based on national regulations?</p>
","<p>There are indeed only two 'official' classifications of aviation incidents, which are defined in <a href=""http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html"">ICAO Annex 13</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accident. An occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft
  which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with
  the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have
  disembarked, in which:</p>
  
  <p>a) a person is fatally or seriously injured as a result of</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>being in the aircraft, or</p></li>
  <li><p>direct contact with any part of the aircraft, including parts which have become detached from the aircraft, or</p></li>
  <li><p>direct exposure to jet blast,</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>except when the injuries are from natural causes, self inflicted or
  inflicted by other persons, or when the injuries are to stowaways
  hiding outside the areas normally available to the passengers and
  crew: or</p>
  
  <p>b) the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure which:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>adversely affects the structural strength, performance or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and</p></li>
  <li><p>would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component,</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>except for engine failure or damage. when the damage is limited to the
  engine, its cowlings or accessories: or for damage limited to
  propellers, wing tips, antennas, tires, brakes, fairings, small dents
  or puncture holes in the aircraft skin: or</p>
  
  <p>c) the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.</p>
  
  <p>Note I.-- For statistical uniformity only, an injury resulting in
  death within thirty days of the date of the accident is classified as
  a fatal injury by ICAO.</p>
  
  <p>Note 2.-- An aircraft is considered to be missing when the official
  search has been terminated and the wreckage has not been located.</p>

<p>And then there is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Incident. An occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the
  operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect the safety of

<h1>As aircraft become stealthier, we'll rely more on the following:</h1>

<ol>
<li><strong>Non-radio sensing</strong> 

<ul>
<li>IR search and track (IRST)</li>
<li>Optical sensing</li>
<li>(EO/IR are/can be combined into essentially an EO/IR telescope. Future designs will use multiple bands (MWIR, SWIR, color HDTV), have wider fields of view</li>
<li>Mid-future: laser tracking and targeting. </li>
<li>High-powered lasers (100s of kW) for fighters <a href=""//youtu.be/Xf2dz_NW1j0"" rel=""noreferrer"">won't debut for decades</a>, but in the meantime they could obtain very high quality bearing, range, speed, and altitude information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Networking and data fusion</strong>

<ul>
<li>Highly integrated aircraft sensors</li>
<li>Off-board targeting</li>
<li>Eg, a very stealthy sensor platform feeding targeting info to less stealthy (even non-stealthy) launch platforms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advanced radars</strong>

<ul>
<li>Multi-band or broadband radars (integrated mid/high-frequency capabilities)</li>
<li>More powerful AESA radars</li>
<li>Better processing</li>
<li>Multi-static arrays to detect side-aspect radar returns. </li>
<li>Side-looking radars. </li>
<li>Again, VLO a/c are not equally stealthy in all directions. They are least detectable from the front aspect.</li>
<li>For instance, the F-22 was to be upgraded with cheek-mounted, side-looking radars, but these were cancelled to reduce cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Even better stealth</strong></li>
</ol>

<h1>Short answer</h1>

<p>Detection ranges will shrink (against other LO fighters). IR sensors <em>may</em> become the primary means of detection. Fighters may cruise at <em>low</em> subsonic speeds to delay detection.</p>

<p>Radar will still remain the primary sensor for years to come (at least 2 decades, the minimum time for adversaries to field large numbers of LO a/c).</p>

<p>Stealth remains essential. </p>

<p><strong>DATA FUSION and NETWORKING become hugely important</strong>; large forces must fight as seamless units. Remote targeting will become more common. Very, very stealthy sensors (eg, F-22 successor) may pass targeting info to less stealthy shooters (eg, F-22, F-35, F-15, missile truck with VLRAAMs)</p>

<p>Future AAMs will feature datalinks and multimode seekers (eg, IR, RF, and laser), improving counter-measure resistance. Many AAMs already have datalinks---shooter guides the missile until the missile's own seeker acquires the target. Advanced propulsion systems debut (multi-pulse motors, ducted-rocket/ramrockets, scramjets), yielding longer range, higher speed, imrpoved kinematics.</p>

<p>Defenses will improve, requiring deeper magazines (smaller weapons and/or larger internal payload bays).</p>

<p>Space, weight, power, and cooling requirements go up. Aircraft grow larger.</p>

<p>Dogfighting will remain rare. Short-range, maneuvering combat will <em>remain</em> unsurvivable with the advent of reliable, high-performance, high Pk, HOBS missiles and helmet-mounted cueing systems. Also, lasers don't miss. (See <code>Myth: guns</code> below.)</p>

<p>5th gen fighters (F-22, F-35) will thoroughly dominate over 4th gen fighters (F-15, Su-35, Typhoon). </p>

<h1>Regarding counter-detection and counter-measures</h1>

<p>Fighters will better hide their RF and IR signature. See: engine exhaust troughs on F-117, B-2, YF-23, and 6th gen fighter concepts. See: AETD, ADVENT, and F135 upgrades. Tails may disappear. </p>

<p>EW (eg, jamming) will remain important (See: <code>Myth: Stealth a/c can't use radar</code>). </p>

<p>DIRCM (directed IR countermeasures, an IR laser to jam/kill missile IR seekers) will protect fighters and bombers. Already slated for the F-35.</p>

<p>Hard-kill missile defenses will debut (likely small anti-missile missiles in near-term; anti-missile lasers 20+ years hence). Today, we rely primarily on soft-kill defenses, like jamming and decoys. </p>

<h1>Answering the question: how will stealth fighters fight each other?</h1>

<p>With better sensors and better stealth. </p>

<p>With mid- to long-range missile shots, but mid-range detection (eg, networked, off-board targeting).</p>

<p>With more lethal weapons (faster/short fight time, improved terminal kinematics, less spoofable sensors).</p>

<p>And with better defenses.</p>

<p>In other words, not <em>unimaginably</em> different from how the F-22 sometimes fights today -- a variation on 5th gen combat. Why? <sup>[See note.]</sup></p>

<p><strong>Because stealth hasn't changed the most critical component of aerial combat since WWI: SA -- situational awareness -- obtain SA and deny it to your enemy.</strong></p>

<li>You'll quickly learn that flying the plane takes a lot more effort and is a lot harder than you imagine. You'll spend much of your time flying the plane (or crashing), not actually fighting... which makes sense because <em>it's the same in real life.</em> (The F-14 has two crew for a reason.) You'll quickly appreciate the luxuries of modern conveniences (like auto-trim). ""Data-fusion"" and ""networking"" will start to mean something. SA will become the difference between life and respawn.</li>
<li>You'll also learn that dogfighting is very dangerous. You'll rely more on your AMRAAMs than you guns (once you learn to use the radar ;)). You'll resent the Russian IR AAMs, which don't show up on your radar warning receiver. You'll learn the F-16 is not nearly as agile at medium altitude as headlines led you to believe... especially not when loaded with weapons, fuel, and sensors. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>To give you a snippet of The Radar Game:</p>

<ul>
<li>In most victories, the target isn't aware they're being shot at. SA was determinant.</li>
<li>The most successful aces don't engage in gladiatorial 1v1 dogfights -- more like hit-n-run.</li>
<li>Points 1 and 2 apply from WWI to the present day.</li>
<li>Reaction times are measured in seconds, a function of detection range and closing speed. Radar increases your reaction time; stealth decreases your enemy's reaction time.</li>
</ul>

<p>[Note well: <a href=""//youtu.be/zxK6O5--9Z0?t=270"" rel=""noreferrer"">5th gen platforms already operate differently from their predecessors (""speed is life"")</a>].</p>

<p>[Note: it goes w/o saying my prognostications are opinions. Although I'm confident in my predictions -- which are vague but reflect longstanding trends and realistic S&amp;T developments -- I don't pretend certainty.]</p>

<h1>Addressing myths</h1>

<h2>Myth: Stealth aircraft can't use radars / turning on radars instantly reveals your location</h2>

<p>Low-probability of intercept functionality allow you to use your radar without being detected you. Principals of operation include using wider-frequency bandwidth (wideband), frequency hopping, using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave signal, using only the minimum power required for the task, and pulse compression. <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_probability_of_intercept_radar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wiki has a good summary.</a> AESA radars are particularly suitable because of their thin, pencil-like beams and minimal side-lobes.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""//web.archive.org/web/20120914110145/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2006/Sep/06Sep_Denk.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Naval Postgraduate School thesis</a> on the detection and jamming of LPI radars.</p>

<p>This is similar to how LO a/c communicate without being detected. The F-35 is equipped with MADL - <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MADL"" rel=""noreferrer"">multifunction advanced datalink</a> - a stealthy, secure, minimum power, high data rate, line of sight comms system. </p>

<h2>Myth: IR sensors render stealth obsolete</h2>

<p><strong>IR sensors do <em>not</em> see as far as radar</strong> (contrary to other answers here).</p>

<p>Against 4th gen fighters (non-stealthy platforms):</p>

<ul>
<li>IRST detection range is typically measured in low-dozens of miles.</li>
<li>The F-15's radar ranges out to 100 nmi</li>
<li>The F-22's radar ranges out to 150 nmi</li>
<li>The E-3 Sentry's radar ranges out to 400 nmi</li>
</ul>

<p>For reference, the F-14's optical (not IR) system could ID and track bombers out to 50 nmi. Perhaps 15-25 nmi for fighters. (Some IR bands are less readily  absorbed by the air than visible light.)</p>

<p>The PIRATE IRST may detect a VLO fighter (with RF and some IR reduction) from these ranges (CSBA):</p>

<pre><code>Altitude  | Mach | Stag temp | Ambient | Contrast | Detection range
==========|======|===========|=========|==========|================
45,000 ft | 1.8  |  85 C     | -56 C   | 141 K    | 150 nmi
45,000 ft | 0.8  | -28 C     | -56 C   |  28 K    |  48 nmi
45,000 ft | 0.5  | -45 C     | -56 C   |  17 K    |
</code></pre>

<p><sup>(150 nmi figure assumes no afterburner, ie supercruise.)</sup></p>

<p>While IR is harder than radar to jam at long range, it can't estimate target range as easily.</p>

<p>Again, IR sensors don't see as far as radar, but they are harder to jam from long range. Historically, NATO fielded better radars and jammers than the Soviets, who therefore couldn't rely as heavily on their radars. So the Russians added IRST capabilities to augment their radars.</p>

<p>Remember also that the US flies dozens of AWACS that usually detect enemy a/c long before even an F-15's radar. So IRST wasn't as critical for US fighters.</p>

<p>The F-22 has a space reservation for IR sensors, but that upgrade was cut to reduce costs.</p>

<p>The F-14 received an EOST relatively early because its main targets were large, Soviet bombers, which are easier to detect. </p>

<p>The US eventually added IRST to late-block F-16's, Super Hornets, and of course the F-35, which fields the most complete IR sensor suite of any fighter. The F-35 has a stealthy, built-in IRST that doubles as a targeting pod. (<a href=""//youtu.be/L2q65qOl1tM?t=42"" rel=""noreferrer"">Demo</a>.) Its DAS also allows pilots to see in a complete sphere (4 pi steradian) around the a/c, even through the floor and headrest (no blindspots); its primary function is missile approach and warning.</p>

<p>The F-35 is an important example here because it'll soon comprise the backbone of NATO aviation for decades. Some 3,400 F-35s are slated for production, more than all F-15s, Super Hornets, Rafales, Gripens, Eurofighters, and Su-27s produced to date <em>combined</em>.</p>

F-16), range, stealth, weapons (gun), software, cost -- I'll direct you to these <a href=""//aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25312/if-all-fighter-jets-become-stealthy-how-will-they-fight-each-other-in-the-futur/25319?noredirect=1#comment60734_25321"">two</a>..<a href=""//aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25312/if-all-fighter-jets-become-stealthy-how-will-they-fight-each-other-in-the-futur/25319?noredirect=1#comment60735_25321"">comments</a> on kinematics, <a href=""//comprehensiveinformation.blogspot.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">this compendium</a>, and <a href=""//reddit.com/r/F35Lightning"" rel=""noreferrer"">this community</a>.

<h2>Myth: Stealth makes you invisible to radar</h2>

<p>Not quite.</p>

<p>Stealth vastly reduces your RCS, but does not completely erase it.</p>

<p>VLO a/c are much, much harder to detect and track. Active radar detection range goes with RCS<sup>1/4</sup>. So a 10x reduction in RCS roughly halves detection range. [See <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar#Radar_equation"" rel=""noreferrer"">radar equation</a>.] </p>

<p>For example, an F-22 or F-35 has an RCS of 0.0001 m<sup>2</sup>. A clean [unarmed] F-16 has an X-band RCS of about 2 m<sup>2</sup>. <strong>The F-22/35 will be detected at 12-22x shorter ranges than the F-15/16</strong>---effectively under 5-10 miles when using a fighter-class radar. That's almost close enough to see [see note] and certainly within IRST range.</p>

<pre><code>Platform | RCS m^2 | 1/range | Detection range
=========|=========|=========|==================
 F-15    | 25      |  1.0    | 100.
Su-27    | 15      |  1.1    |  88.
 F-16C   |  1.2    |  2.1    |  47.
 F-18    |  1      |  2.2    |  45.
Rafale   |  1      |  2.2    |  45.
Typhoon  |   .5    |  2.6    |  38.
Bird     |   .01   |  7.1    |  14.

 F-35    |   .0001 | 22      |   4.5
</code></pre>

<p><sup>(RCS values are ballpark figures for <em>clean</em> aircraft. External stores greatly increase RCS. A typical F-16 loadout for permissive environments (eg, ISIS, COIN) includes 2x 370 gal fuel tanks, 2x 2000 lb JDAMs (or equivalent), 2x AMRAAMs, 1x Sniper targeting pod. 2x AMRAAMs, 2x AIM-9s, a nav pod (eg LANTIRN), and an ECM pod may be added in more challenging environments.

<p>[Note that visual range is theoretically up to 20 miles. But in 99.9% of real life cases it's &lt;5 miles. Often just 2-4 miles.]</p>

<p>Note that once loaded with fuel and weapons, the F-16 and F-15 have much larger RCS values, so will be detected from even further out.</p>

<p>Also, while we no longer use large faceted designs (see: F-117) thanks to modern computing, we still shape our a/c to direct radar energy in certain directions away from the transmitter -- mostly to the sides and above -- in narrow lobes or ""spikes.""</p>

<h2>Myth: Stealth is obsolete / stealth is a hoax / stealth is marketing</h2>

<p>LO remains relevant (and very useful) for the same reason armor didn't become obsolete when antitank guided missiles were fielded. </p>

<p>LO also makes jamming far more efficient. Jamming basically hides your aircraft's 25 m<sup>2</sup> RCS. If your RCS is only 0.0001 m<sup>2</sup>, it takes far less power to hide yourself, and your jamming will work at far greater range. <a href=""//youtu.be/d5T1vPmA-l4?t=6m27s"" rel=""noreferrer"">Primer: how jamming works</a>.</p>

<p>LO technologies drastically reduce detection ranges and warning times. Sensors that work well against stealthy aircraft would work <em>far better against non-stealthy aircraft.</em> </p>

<p>What's the alternative to stealth? No stealth? Make our aircraft <em>easier</em> to detect and track?</p>

<p>All future combat a/c designs must consider signature reduction going forward---at the very least <em>some</em> signature reduction, if not outright VLO designs---camouflaged tanks are always more desirable than this (or <a href=""//i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2012/images/10/19/pinkm60.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>):

<h2>Myth: WWII radars / low-frequency radars make stealth obsolete / an F-117 was shot down by an 1960s radar with simple modifications</h2>

<p><strong>First, the F-117 story is untrue</strong>. The Serbs claimed they made simple modifications to their old Soviet radars, allowing them to easily spot the F-117s. But <a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Dani"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zoltán Dani</a>, the Serbian commander who shot down the F-117 in Kosovo, later admitted on national TV that he never modified the radars, merely used the lowest frequency setting. He explained that he fabricated his story for propaganda. Others alleged he did it to take [more] credit for shooting down the F-117. </p>

<p>Also, NATO jamming support was unavailable the night the F-117 was shot down. Dani was aware, so he turned his radars on a third time without relocating, which allowed him to obtain the fateful radar lock.</p>

<p>But more importantly (and accurately) the F-117 was shot down because of lazy mission planning by the US. The F-117 flew the same route night after night at roughly the same hours. So the Serbs moved their radars directly beneath the anticipated flight path. After a number of attempts were made over several nights, they finally got a lock at just 8 mi (13 km) when the bomb bay doors opened. The F-117 doesn't have a radar warning receiver---the pilot never knew he was directly overflying a SAM radar site (doable, but still ill-advised for any stealth fighter). He only ejected because he visually spotted the missile heading for him.</p>

<p>People forget the F-117 is an old design. It entered service in 1983, just five years after the F-16 and nine years after the F-14. Back then, we didn't know how to integrate radars and other apertures into the skin without compromising its low signature. </p>

<p>To be clear, a kill is a kill, and Dani deserves credit. People also forget that the Serbian forces were motivated, competent, and well-trained---measurably more so than Saddam's air defenses. The Serbs performed much better than the Iraqis and learned much from the lessons of Desert Storm.</p>

<p>The F-117 was only shot down once in its entire career, despite regularly flying into some of the most heavily defended airspace in the world, a feat no other platform could perform without <a href=""//aviation.stackexchange.com/a/21258/7394"">massive support (expensive!)</a>... </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGbs8.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGbs8.png"" alt=""(value of stealth""></a></p>

<p>...or <a href=""//aviation.stackexchange.com/a/21258/7394"">massive losses</a> (save the B-2, F-22, F-35). Stealth alone allowed the F-117 to survive. Even F-15s and Su-35s would have been shot down in droves if we sent them on the same missions alone.

<p><strong>Second, low-frequency radars have several drawbacks:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>extremely large and power hungry, suitable only for ground-based platforms, not fighters. Some are vehicle-based, but as so large, they're only semi-mobile</li>
<li>require large apertures to function, owing to their long wavelengths</li>
<li>easiest to spoof </li>
<li>easy to detect from long range</li>
<li>detection range is grossly over-advertised</li>
<li>resolution is terrible (on the order of kilometers), making them unsuitable for targeting.</li>
<li>the most straightforward countermeasure to low-freq radars is to make aircraft larger. So VLO bombers (large a/c) are far less detectable by low-freq radars

<ul>
<li>(Principal: long wavelengths approach the feature size on aircraft, like tails, so shaping is less effective in redirecting radar returns)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>all the above make them easy targets for long-range weapons like cruise missiles. </li>
<li>for all the above reasons, they're usually used as early warning radars or to cue higher-frequency radars.</li>
</ul>

<p>High frequency radars are suitable for targeting, are more jam resistant, and are smaller/lighter. That's why fighters are optimised for stealth at higher frequencies.</p>

<p>Analogy: you can <em>hear</em> a fly buzzing around your room <em>somewhere</em> (detection), but you must <em>see</em> it to swat it (higher resolution sensor for weapons quality track). You can use your ears to cue your eyes, but you'll never hit it with your eyes closed.</p>

<h2>Myth: WVR combat / dogfighting is the primary arena of aerial combat</h2>

<p>First, WVR combat =/= dogfighting =/= guns.</p>

<p>Second...</p>

<h2>Myth: Guns are the primary weapons of aerial combat. F-4's were massacred by obsolete MiG-21s in Vietnam because they didn't have guns.</h2>

<h3>Common F-4 myth</h3>

<p>When Vietnam started, USAF and Navy F-4's claimed just a 2:1 kill/loss ratio. Here commentators often blamed malfunctioning missiles and lack of a gun.</p>

<p>So the USAF added a gun to the F-4, but their K/L remained at 2:1.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Navy began a new program to better train pilots how to use their missiles. They also trained the maintenance crews how to properly handle and maintain their missiles. They did not add a gun.</p>

<p>By war's end, the ""sluggish"" Navy F-4's claimed a 12:1 K/L ratio against its more maneuverable adversaries like the ""agile"" MiG-21.</p>

<p>That training program? It became TOPGUN. (<a href=""//sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/October-2009/Top-Gun-40-Years-of-Higher-Learning/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>.)</p>

<h3>Welcome to the BVR missile era</h3>

<p>The last fighter v. fighter guns kill was in 1989, an Iranian F-4E shooting down an Iraqi Su-22 (<a href=""//csbaonline.org/publications/2015/04/trends-in-air-to-air-combat-implications-for-future-air-superiority/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CSBA</a>). The F-35's gun is largely for air to ground.</p>

<p>The vast majority of kills over the last 40 years were achieved with missiles:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhIDl.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhIDl.png"" alt=""csba kills""></a></p>

<p><sup>(Global, fixed-wing v fixed wing. ""Other"" includes things like CFIT and flying into your own drop tanks. <a href=""//csbaonline.org/publications/2015/04/trends-in-air-to-air-combat-implications-for-future-air-superiority/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CSBA</a>. See pg 24, pg 36 of 76). <a href=""//redd.it/3x3dpy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Annotation</a>.</sup></p>

<p>In the 1960s, guns still dominated. Most gun kills were achieved by Israelis; they used guns exclusively because no one would sell them missiles. </p>

<p>However, by the 1970s, missiles accounted for more kills than guns. </p>

<p>Even in Vietnam, the AIM-7 Sparrow missile accounted for more kills than any other weapon.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mOXa.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mOXa.png"" alt=""nam aim7""></a></p>

<p>North Vietnam <em>also</em> favored missiles for the balance of its air to air kills, especially as the war progressed.</p>

<p>By Desert Storm, most shots were fired from BVR. Few air to air engagements required any significant maneuvering at all. Only two air to air guns kills were claimed: A-10s vs helos. In another engagement, a helo was destroyed by a laser-guided bomb. In other words, ""A2A"" bombs killed nearly as many a/c as guns in the Gulf War. Iraq also lost 3 a/c to CFIT.</p>

<p>And yes, we make <strong>supremely</strong> better missiles today.</p>

<p>Early AAMs were more akin to guided cannon shells: narrow field of view, short range, and low maneuverability; often only chased a target in front of them (tail chase).</p>

<p>Modern AAMs (HOBS, LOAL) have comparatively stupendous ranges: a modern SRAAM (188 lb AIM-9X Sidewinder) has roughly the range of the original AIM-7 Sparrow (a much larger 500 lb MRAAM); and the new AIM-120D AMRAAM (335 lb MRAAM) has nearly the range of the legendary AIM-54 Phoenix (1000 lb LRAAM).</p>

<p>You will not easily outrun a Mach 3 missile pulling 50 g's with a 200° field of view. Why turn 720° when you can <a href=""//youtu.be/6YMSfg26YSQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">shoot almost directly behind you? (video of AIM-9X testing, 2000)</a>. (Realistically, some level of maneuverability is required for good shots, but far less than for a guns solution.) <a href=""//redd.it/42nst8"" rel=""noreferrer"">More videos, gifs, gfys, and MICA.</a></p>

<p>Reliability. In ODS: shot 28 AIM-7s at BVR, 22 hit the target or fireball; 10x more reliable than AIM-7s in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Essentially, missiles are now far better dogfighters than fighters.</p>

<p>But the best dogfighting weapon <em>by far</em> is neither gun nor missile: it's a wingman. Fighters don't fly alone. When you dogfight, A) you rapidly bleed speed and altitude, and B) your SA evaporates because you can't afford to focus on anything else except the guy you're turning with. You're effectively a sitting duck and blind, an easy target for anyone outside the fight. </p>

<p>Dogfighting is extremely dangerous. Two modern fighters are liable to both die in a dogfight, ie a kill/loss ratio of 1:1.</p>

<p>I know of no pilot who prefers dogfighting over taking BVR shots.</p>

<p>Dogfighting may not be dead. But it sure is on life support.</p>

"Can a Boeing 777 be hacked?","12970","","<p>All this confusion over flight 370 has me wondering if it would be possible to hack into an airplane and control the autopilot or other on-board systems in a way that the pilots couldn't regain control.</p>

<p>I know some basic searching reveals some articles such as <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-12/hacking-an-airplane-with-only-an-android-phone"">this one</a>. If the plane can't be hacked, could someone with the proper knowledge snip or disable the pilot's override?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I know 0 about aviation, but I am a programmer. So my guess would be that anything that doesn't have a physical disconnect would be vulnerable to being hacked without being able to override it.</p>

<p>Additional Disclaimer: This is a question about curiousity / possibility, not a how-to.</p>
","<p>As of currently, the answer to this question is in principle <strong>no for commercial aircraft</strong>, at least not remotely. There are two parts to this:</p>

<p>From a system perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Aircraft systems could probably be 'hacked'- assuming you could for instance screw up the flight computer by changing the chips in the belly- but there is no way you could really pull this off without the pilots noticing the course being way off from the compass for instance, so they'd figure out and shut it off. Many systems are not connected in a way that allows them to be cause damage to others. Systems are also pretty dedicated- if it's supposed to fly the plane, that's what it does, if it's supposed to navigate, that's what it does.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems on aircraft generally a have limited, if any, connection to the outside world. There are a few systems that have the ability to connect to the ground, and this is generally limited to simple text messages. Most of the electronics on the 777 are from the type's introduction in 1994. A decent analogy I think is trying to hack an early cell phone remotely. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And from a practical standpoint:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Aircraft are generally very stiff when it comes to changes- they are often approved in a certain configuration, and that then sticks, so there's little need to change stuff, and hence it's not possible. This applies to the autopilot and flight controls- once it's there, it stays there.</p></li>
<li><p>As a few people have pointed out, these systems are proprietary and closed source, making it difficult to program them if you're an outsider, but in theory it might be possible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that no aircraft, even the computer-intensive Airbus, have really been hacked to any extent, the notion that the entire aircraft would be taken over and flown somewhere is impossible.</p>

<p><strong>As for original question <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-12/hacking-an-airplane-with-only-an-android-phone"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The FAA has determined that the hacking technique described during a
  recent computer security conference does not pose a flight safety
  concern because it does not work on certified flight hardware,” he
  said.</p>
  
  <p>“The described technique cannot engage or control the aircraft’s
  autopilot system using the FMS or prevent a pilot from overriding the
  autopilot,” said Dorr.</p>
  
  <p>“Therefore, a hacker cannot obtain ‘full control of an aircraft,’ as
  the technology consultant has claimed,” said Dorr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a similar accord, I think I heard a story about a Bombardier Dash 8 that got a computer virus once, but I think it never got beyond the navigation system, the most processing intensive part. Unfortunately, I can't find a source for this.</p>

<p>From the site: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main feature of the circular runway is that it will become
  possible to let an aircraft operate always at landing and take-off
  with headwind. Whatever its strength and direction, the Endless Runway
  becomes independent of the wind. When allowing  limited crosswind,
  airspace users can shorten the global trajectory of the flights 
  through optimized departure and arrival routes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from that they seem to hope that they can start/land more airplanes per time unit by shifting the start/landing point thus avoiding the problem that airplanes must not follow other airplanes to close along the same trajectory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In what situations does ATC ask for ident, and is it ever required by procedure?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, ""ident"" is used to help a controller identify an aircraft's secondary radar (transponder) return. By asking the pilot to ""squawk ident,"" the controller can ensure that the aircraft he/she is talking to matches the radar target he thinks is that aircraft.</p>

<p>It can also be used for communication, to allow a pilot to respond if their radio transmitter has failed.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a method to allow a controller to identify an aircraft on radar, per section 5-3-3 of <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/7110.65"">FAA Order 7110.65 (pdf)</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When using only Mode 3/A radar beacon to identify a target, use one of the following methods:</p>
  
  <p><strong>a.</strong> Request the aircraft to activate the ""IDENT"" feature of the transponder and then observe the identification display.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>For lost communication, per section 10-4-4 of <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/7110.65"">7110.65</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take the following actions, as appropriate, if two-way radio communications are lost with an aircraft:</p>
  
  <p><strong>c.</strong> Attempt to re-establish communication by having the aircraft use its transponder or make turns to acknowledge clearances and answer questions. Request any of the following in using the transponder:</p>
  
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Request the aircraft to reply Mode 3/A “IDENT.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last scenario is common when experiencing radio failures. If ATC suspects that you might be able to <em>hear</em> them but not to talk back, they might say something like ""Cessna 12345, if you can hear me, squawk ident."" If you reply by pressing the IDENT button, they can then issue you further instructions and ask you to acknowledge those instructions by pressing IDENT again.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What does the transponder actually do in this mode?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In normal operation, every time the transponder receives an <em>interrogation</em> from a ground station, it replies with a data block containing certain pieces of information. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_%28aviation%29#Ident"">This data block contains</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The encoded pressure altitude (for Mode C transponders)</li>
<li>A 12-bit identification code (this is the 4-digit code you select in the cockpit)</li>
<li>A single extra bit for the ""ident"" flag</li>
</ul>

<p>When you push the IDENT button in the cockpit, the transponder sets that extra ""ident"" bit in its reply data. Anytime the transponder is interrogated while IDENT is active (for a set duration of time after you press the button in the cockpit), its reply data block will have the IDENT bit set. ATC computer systems notice this and cause the IDENT to be shown on the controller's radar display.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What does the controller see on their screen?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the type of radar system in use. Generally the radar target will either blink, its symbol will change (or ""blossom""), or an indication such as ""ID"" will blink in the aircraft's data block (where the callsign is shown).</p>

<p>The AIM has some schematic pictures that show what an IDENT looks like on an ARTS-III scope (an older system still in use at some TRACONs). See <a href=""http://www.faraim.org/aim/aim-4-03-14-229.html"">Figures 4-5-2</a> and <a href=""http://www.faraim.org/aim/aim-4-03-14-231.html"">4-5-3</a>.</p>

<p>I will try to find some pictures of other radar systems such as those used at ARTCCs and newer TRACONs.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Does it depend at all on either the code or the mode the transponder is currently set for?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code doesn't matter. The IDENT flag is an extra bit in the transponder's reply data that's independent of the 12 bits used for the code.</p>

<p>Obviously the IDENT will only be observed if the transponder is operating (not OFF or in a STANDBY mode). But the IDENT works in any mode used by normal civilian transponders (Modes A, C or S).</p>

"Can a pilot fly through a restricted area while flying on a Victor Airway?","12916","","<p>For example if you look at V 23-165-597, from Seal Beach CA to Ocean Side CA, you will notice that it goes through restricted area for Camp Pendleton (R-2503A &amp; D):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V57gU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I was trying to understand what is the rule as far as ATC Clearance to enter those Airspace or any other Airspace in general when you are on those Victor Airways.</p>

<p>Where can I find the FAA rules about these Victor Airways?</p>
","<p>Short answer: yes, with permission. Whether or not you're on an airway isn't really relevant.</p>

<p>The basic regulations on restricted airspace are in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=14:2.0.1.3.10#se14.2.91_1133"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">14 CFR 91.133</a> and they apply to all aircraft on all flights:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) No person may operate an aircraft within a restricted area
  (designated in part 73) contrary to the restrictions imposed, or
  within a prohibited area, unless that person has the permission of the
  using or controlling agency, as appropriate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0304.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AIM 3-4-3</a> also makes it clear that you can enter restricted airspace (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Restricted areas contain airspace identified by an area on the surface
  of the earth within which the flight of aircraft, <strong>while not wholly
  prohibited</strong>, is subject to restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it has details of how ATC handles IFR traffic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. If the restricted area is not active and has been released to the controlling agency (FAA), the ATC facility will allow the aircraft to
  operate in the restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance
  for it to do so.</p>
  
  <p>2. If the restricted area is active and has not been released to the controlling agency (FAA), the ATC facility will issue a clearance
  which will ensure the aircraft avoids the restricted airspace unless
  it is on an approved altitude reservation mission or has obtained its
  own permission to operate in the airspace and so informs the
  controlling facility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you can fly through restricted airspace if the controlling agency gives you permission, either directly or via ATC. In the specific case of the Camp Pendleton restricted areas, the Los Angeles sectional says that you should contact LA Center or SoCal TRACON (for R-2503D), and shows that the areas are not active 24 hours per day:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xDynp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So in theory you can fly through at 3am without asking anyone, but if you're planning a flight that goes through a restricted area you should make sure you get a flight briefing and ask the briefer about that point specifically. And it wouldn't hurt to confirm again in the air before entering, in case the areas 'go hot' suddenly.</p>

"Is a pilot allowed to sleep during a flight?","12915","","<p>While in a flight, a pilot wants to sleep.  Given that the aircraft has an autopilot facility, are they allowed to sleep for a while (e.g., half an hour)? </p>

<p>What would happen if it's not allowed, but they still did it?  Would air traffic controllers know?</p>
","<p>Airline flight crews generally consist of at least 2 pilots. One pilot is designated as pilot flying, the other is the pilot not flying, observing instruments and flight parameters. If required, pilots can use <a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Flight_Crew_In-Seat_Rest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flight Crew in-Seat Rest</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Flight Crew in-Seat Rest</b><br>
  This is the process whereby pilots may take short periods of sleep (naps), while temporarily relieved of operational duties in accordance with carefully prescribed ‘controlled rest’ procedures, when part of a two-man operating crew of an in-flight aeroplane. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not communicated to ATC and only allowed with two pilots present on the flight-deck. It is prohibited to have both pilots participate in <strong>in-Seat Rest</strong> at the same time.</p>

"How do pilots manage to remember ATC instructions?","12875","","<p>Before takeoff, during flight, before landing and for taxiing, pilots are given several instructions by ATC.</p>

<p>Do they mentally remember all instructions? Or do they note them down somewhere such as in a notebook so that they do not forget?</p>
","<p>It depends.  Some instructions are really simple and with a little practice, are very easy to remember.  </p>

<pre><code>Runway 27 right, line-up and wait
Turn left heading 250, descend flight level 120.
</code></pre>

<p>Other ones will be so common, they are just remembered:</p>

<pre><code>Taxi to Gate 1 via Alpha, Alpha 1, Lima 3, cross runway 24, hold short Delta.
</code></pre>

<p>But this is where the danger creeps in.  It is possible, and has happened, that the crew <strong>think</strong> they heard something but actually, the instruction was different today.</p>

<pre><code>Taxi to Gate 1 via Alpha, Alpha 3, cross runway 24, hold short Delta.
</code></pre>

<p>The prudent crew will write it down.  <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9204/what-is-this-component-in-an-airbus-cockpit"">Large aircraft have tables</a>, or boards clipped to the control column on which to write taxi clearances, complex airways clearances and so on.</p>

<p>In some large aircraft, many light aircraft and in helicopters, pilots might wear a kneeboard to write instructions on.  It is a minor advantage to me that I am left handed and as a helicopter pilot, this means that my kneeboard is on my left leg where I can easily write without taking my hand off the cyclic and having it right next to the collective.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jHTJs.jpg"" alt=""TSGT LANCE CHEUNG, USAF. - This Image was released by the United States Air Force with the ID DF-SD-01-07429""></p>

<p><sup><a href=""http://research.archives.gov/description/6514935"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TSGT LANCE CHEUNG, USAF. - This Image was released by the United States Air Force with the ID DF-SD-01-07429</a></sup></p>

<p>Most instructions come in the same order, every flight.  For example, here is a simplified list.  This happens every time so the crew know what's coming next, what it will likely contain, and how to respond:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clearance for the flight plan.</li>
<li>Permission to start and push back. </li>
<li>Taxi instructions.</li>
<li>Departure instructions.</li>
<li>Take off clearance.</li>
<li>Hand-off from departure controller to area controller.
etc etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that any instruction which will cause the aircraft to change it's configuration or location must be repeated.  The controller then also gets to check they've got it right.  This includes things like speed, direction or altitude changes, taxi and departure instructions, frequency and squawk changes etc.   </p>

<p>There are also some words which are only ever used at certain times, e.g. ""takeoff"" is only ever said when an aircraft is cleared to take off.  For example, ""ready for departure"" tells the controller that the aircraft is prepared to take off immediately.  The crew should not say ""ready for takeoff"".</p>

<p>You can sometimes hear a pilot receiving a long instruction, start to read it back, pause, then ask for a repeat.  Very frustrating when you are sitting there waiting to get your request in.  You just know they thought they could remember it, but didn't.  Write it down if it's anything except a simple instruction or clearance.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a complex one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SuperAir 123, cleared to Barcelona via vector departure, fly runway track, climb altitude 5000ft, after passing 2000ft turn right direct Hamm VOR, route as filed, squawk 1234, information Alpha current, startup approved </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crew might write it down like this.  Each pilot develops their own preferred shorthand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>VD RWY TRK 5000 / 2000+ RT HMM / SQ1234 ALPHA / SU</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very brief since they know what each part is and the order they come in.</p>

<p>Since it contains instructions, the crew will then read it back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cleared Barcelona via vector departure, runway track 5000ft, after passing 2000ft right direct Hamm, squawk 1234, Alpha on-board, startup approved. SuperAir 123.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, a good reason to write stuff down is because sometimes (and we've all been there), you think you remember, then turn round to your co-pilot 2 minutes later and ask ""what was that altitude?"".</p>

<p>Here's a great <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D88EZJ2wJ7M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example of someone who didn't have a pen</a> and an approach to writing down clearances.</p>

"Can a passenger jet be towed to safety if it breaks down in midair?","12776","","<p>A car can be towed by a tow truck to the repair shop when it breaks down on the highway. Is it possible for a passenger plane to be towed by an emergency tow plane along the air corridor to the next nearest airport assuming it cannot reach there on its own power (example if it runs out of fuel or both pilots are incapacitated)?</p>

<p>Update:
This question actually consist of two parts. Whether it is feasible and whether this is practical. I have seen a small tugboat towing a barge; a man pulling a firetruck. Before writing off this idea completely, can someone address what's stopping a fighter plane from towing a passenger jet if a proper point of harness is installed?</p>
","<p>Towing is quite feasible, and even landing while in tow is possible - I've done it myself in gliders. The hard part is catching up with the stricken plane.</p>

<p>To stay with Keegan's Boeing 777: It most likely will travel at Mach 0.8 and somewhere between 30.000 and 39.000 ft when disaster strikes. Let's further assume that power fails instantly, so the aircraft, traveling at 240 m/s, will develop a sink rate of 15 m/s just to continue flying. When it sinks, the increasing density allows it to slow down, so at sea level it will fly at 130 m/s, sinking with 8.125 m/s. For simplicity, assume a linearly decreasing sink rate, and the remaining time aloft will be less than 1000 sec or around a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Now the towplane has 15 min to scramble the crew, run up the engines, get take-off clearance and to actually fly an intercept to the stricken airliner. How realistic is that? How many airports are needed to have 777-sized towplanes ready, and how many otherwise unproductive 777s would this scheme need?</p>

<h1>Ground delay programs (GDP)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Ground Delay Program (GDP) is a traffic management procedure  where
  aircraft are delayed at their departure airport in order to  manage
  demand and capacity at their arrival airport. Flights are  assigned
  departure times, which in turn regulates their arrival time  at the
  impacted airport.  </p>
  
  <p>GDP will normally be implemented at airports where capacity has  been
  reduced because of weather—such as low ceilings, thunderstorms  or
  wind—or when demand exceeds capacity for a sustained period.  </p>
  
  <p>GDPs are implemented to ensure the arrival demand at an airport  is
  kept at a manageable level to preclude extensive holding and to 
  prevent aircraft from having to divert to other airports. They are 
  also used in support of Severe Weather Avoidance Plan (SWAP).  (See
  section on SWAP.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Airspace flow programs (AFP)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Airspace Flow Programs (AFP) were introduced in Summer 2006  and
  marked a significant new step in en route traffic management.  The
  principal goal for the initial deployment was to provide enhanced  en
  route traffic management during severe weather events. An AFP  is a
  traffic management process that identifies constraints in the  en
  route system, develops a real-time list of flights that are filed into
  the  constrained area, and distributes EDCTs to meter the demand
  through  the area.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Ground stops (GS)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A ground stop (GS) is a procedure requiring aircraft that meet 
  specific criteria to remain on the ground. The GS may be airport 
  specific, related to a geographical area, or equipment related.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Severe weather avoidance plan (SWAP)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>SWAP is a formalized program that is developed for areas susceptible 
  to disruption in air traffic flows caused by thunderstorms. Each air 
  traffic facility may develop its own strategy for managing the severe 
  weather event. Their plan then becomes part of the overall daily 
  operations plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Special traffic management program (STMP)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A STMP is a long-range strategic initiative that is implemented when 
  a location requires special handling to accommodate above-normal 
  traffic demand, e.g., Masters golf tournament, NBAA Convention, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Gate hold</h1>

<p>Gate hold is not a traffic flow management technique, but is instead used by airports to keep you from starting engines and taxing just sit in line burning fuel when you can't takeoff due to a delay program.  It makes everybody's life better if you don't leave in the first place!</p>

"What are pilot position reports?","12770","","<p>I do a lot of shortwave radio listening, and I often listen to MWARA air traffic radio transmissions based out of San Francisco for flights crossing the Pacific Ocean. When giving position reports the pilots always report fuel, position, and some strange names. Usually they give the strange name, and then report ""NEXT --strange name here--"". Some of the names I've heard are ""Diallo"", ""Gallop"", ""Gitsol"" (sp?). What are these?</p>
","<h1>Navigation Fixes</h1>

<p>The words that you are hearing are navigation fixes that are published on the pacific crossing charts.  They are used so that aircraft can report their position to Air Traffic Control using a standard, easy to say name that is located at a specific geographic location.  </p>

<p>You can think of them like street intersections.  Instead of saying <strong><em>29 degrees 44 minutes 18.8 seconds North, 95 degrees 24 minutes 38.5 seconds West</em></strong> (GPS coordinates), you would say <strong><em>the intersection of South Shepherd Drive and West Alabama Street</em></strong><sup>1</sup>.  In the case of aviation though, they take it one step further and give it a five letter (usually) pronounceable name like the ones that you are hearing on the radio.</p>

<p>The navigation fixes that you refer to are standard reporting points located on airways going between the SW coast of the US to/from Hawaii:</p>

<ul>
<li>GALIP and DIALO are on R576 (outbound airway)</li>
<li>GITLE is on R585 (inbound airway)</li>
</ul>

<p>To see an actual chart and to follow along, the FAA offers <a href=""http://aeronav.faa.gov/digital_enroute_planning.asp?eff=02-06-2014&amp;end=04-03-2014"" rel=""noreferrer"">IFR Enroute Aeronautical Planning Charts</a> on their website (these would be on the PORC chart).  Here is a low resolution excerpt from the area that we are talking about:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTUgm.jpg"" alt=""PORC Chart Excerpt CA-HI""></p>

<p>A typical flight will file an airway with only the start and end fixes along with the airway name instead of specifying every fix on the route.  For instance, it might look something like <code>GALIP R576 OGG</code> which tells ATC that they will fly directly between all of the fixes on the airway: <code>GALIP DADIE DIALO DUSAK DRAYK DENNS OOG</code>.  The filled in triangle at each of these fixes means that it is a <strong><em>mandatory</em></strong> reporting point, and they will be required to make a position report every time that they cross one.</p>

<h1>Position Reports</h1>

<p>Position reports are given in a standard format specified in the <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0503.html#6bG96JACK"" rel=""noreferrer"">AIM 5-3-2</a>:</p>

  <p>(a) Identification;</p>
  
  <p>(b) Position;</p>
  
  <p>(c) Time;</p>
  
  <p>(d) Altitude or flight level (include actual altitude or flight level
  when operating on a clearance specifying VFR-on-top);</p>
  
  <p>(e) Type of flight plan (not required in IFR position reports made
  directly to ARTCCs or approach control);</p>
  
  <p>(f) ETA and name of next reporting point;</p>
  
  <p>(g) The name only of the next succeeding reporting point along the
  route of flight; and</p>
  
  <p>(h) Pertinent remarks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example (from 5-3-1):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Name) CENTER, (aircraft identification), (position), (time),
  (altitude), (type of flight plan), (ETA and name of next reporting
  point), (the name of the next succeeding reporting point), AND
  (remarks).</p>

"What is the difference between the airspace's classes (for non-pilots)?","12735","","<p>When I'm reading about aviation, it's very common to see references to <em>Class B</em> or <em>Class C</em> airspace and airports.</p>

<p>What are the different classes and what are the differences between them?</p>
","<p>Although Lnafziger's answer is correct, I'd like to elaborate on the <em>purpose</em> of the airspace classes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Class A:</strong> This airspace is intended for high-speed, point to point travel.  That is why pilots flying in Class A must be instrument rated and in contact with air traffic control (ATC); aircraft above 18,000 feet are likely to travel quickly and may not have time to avoid each other visually.  This is the upper layer of the airspace system.*</li>
<li><strong>Class B:</strong> This airspace is intended for large airports with lots of jet traffic.  The large number and size of aircraft require space for ATC to get them efficiently in and out of the airports.  Approach control services are provided.  As a result, class B areas are physically large.  It is possible for small aircraft flying under visual flight rules to operate here with explict ATC permission, though permission to enter may be denied during periods of high traffic.  Small piston-powered aircraft land at Class B airports infrequently, typically due to high landing fees and fuel prices.</li>
<li><strong>Class C:</strong> Smaller airports with a mix of piston-powered aircraft and jets.  Most Class C airports are home to flight schools and small aircraft hangars as well as scheduled service by airlines.  While still busy, Class C airports have less traffic than Class B, so ATC doesn't need as much space to keep them organized.  Like Class B, approach control services are provided.  Pilots are only required to establish two-way communication to enter the airspace.</li>
<li><strong>Class D:</strong> The smallest airspace type for tower-controlled airports, traffic primarily consists of general aviation aircraft.  Often these airports handle cargo, business jets, charter service, maintenance or assembly facilities, etc. as well as private aircraft and flight schools.  They also host firefighting operations, airshows, or anything else that needs facilities but would interfere with normal traffic if put at a larger airport.  Although Class D airports are small, some are very busy; others handle only a few flights an hour.  Approach control services are only provided if the airport is near Class B or C airspace.</li>
<li><strong>Class E:</strong> This is the lowest level of ""controlled airspace.""  ""Controlled"" doesn't mean you have to talk to ATC, but that ATC services are available (within the capabilities of radar and radio equipment).  This is general-purpose airspace.  Aircraft flying under visual flight rules can fly more-or-less whatever they want (weather permitting), and instrument flight rules traffic operate under positive control by ATC.  There are regulations in this airspace, but they aren't onerous, and they're designed to accommodate the wide variety of aircraft and activities that are found here.  Some small airports have Class E airspace surrounding them at the ground.  Although Class E is a single class of airspace, there are tighter regulations above 10,000 feet, where there are no speed restrictions (other than the prohibition on supersonic flight over land), compared to at lower altitudes where speeds are limited to 250 knots.</li>
<li><strong>Class F:</strong> See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/406/what-is-class-f-airspace-and-why-is-it-not-used-in-the-us"">What is Class F airspace, and why is it not used in the US?</a></li>
<li><strong>Class G:</strong> This is found near the ground everywhere except controlled airspace around airports, and occasionally at higher altitudes in remote areas (Alaska or the Rockies, usually), but never above 14,500 feet.  Most untowered airports have Class G airspace surrounding them.  This is ""uncontrolled"" airspace, so there is no ATC service available at all.  Radio and radar work better the higher you go, so at low altitudes you just can't expect good results.  Class G serves as a notice that ATC services are unavailable, typically due to a lack of radar coverage.  In remote areas, the same problems occur at higher altitudes (radar won't see you if you go behind a mountain, and sometimes you're just too far) so Class G is found there as well.  Most of the time, the only reason anybody goes into Class G airspace is because they're taking off or landing at an uncontrolled airport, or transiting certain areas that lack radar coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> There are many kinds of special-use airspace, all of which serve as keep-out signs of varying levels from ""please be considerate"" up to ""will shoot on sight.""  In the US, these don't really interact with airspace classification.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>
* Technically, airspace above 60,000 feet is Class E, but nobody goes up there except scientific and spy/military flights.<br/></p>

"How much radiation is an airline pilot exposed to in a year?","12668","","<p>Flying exposes us to more radiation since we are closer to the sun, and there is less atmosphere to protect us.</p>

<p>Consider an airline pilot flying on a routine and frequent basis. How much radiation is absorbed per flight hour, and per year?</p>
","<p>The average additional annual dose for flight crew is 2.19 mSv (milli sieverts).  <a href=""http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html"">http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html</a></p>

<p>The typical annual dose from background sources is 4 mSv (this varies enormously on the Earth's surface). However, as a rough order of thumb, the annual radiation dose of a flight crew member increases by about 50% compared to sitting on the ground.</p>

<p>For comparison with other sources, having a chest CT scan provides you with a 7 mSv dose over the period of a few minutes.</p>

<p>The maximum permitted dose in one year for a radiation worker under US Federal Law is 50 mSv.</p>

<p>For more comparisons of radiation dose, see <a href=""https://xkcd.com/radiation/"">https://xkcd.com/radiation/</a></p>

<p>On a technical point, the premise of your question is incorrect.</p>

<p>Flying exposes us to additional cosmic background radiation because we are at a greater height above the Earth's surface, not because we are closer to the sun. We are protected from cosmic radiation by the presence of the Earth's magnetic field, which extends far into space and is not an issue here except very close to the poles; and more importantly, by the layer of atmosphere above our heads that tends to absorb cosmic rays before they reach the surface. At 40,000 feet, the bulk of the atmosphere by mass is below you.</p>

<p>It is not presently believed that a substantial fraction of these rays are emitted by the sun. For one, you will continue to be irradiated by them at night.</p>

<p>(For interest, if you could see the cosmic background radiation, it would be approximately as bright on the night sky as star light is; for complex reasons the two energies are in rough equipartition.)</p>

"Why does it feel like a plane accelerates just before touching down?","12625","","<p>On commercial flights it often feels like the plane is gets faster just before touching down. What creates that sensation?</p>
","<p>The aircraft flares just before touching down. It descends with a constant velocity, and just before touching down pulls the nose up to reduce the descent. This results in a higher angle of attack, more lift, and a vertical deceleration of the airplane. A passenger perceives this vertical deceleration as a force. Direction of the force is straight down and the aircraft is nose up, you're leaning back, so there is a component of (gravity + vertical deceleration) that pushes you into the back of your seat.</p>

<p>This same effect is used in flight simulators with a motion base. Upon accelerating, the simulator pushes forward like the aircraft does, but also slowly rotates backwards so that the pilot feels sustained seat back pressure. He cannot see the leaning back angle inside the simulator because the horizon of the projected outside visual image does not move. As happens in the aircraft: look forward in the aircraft and your view of the inside of the aircraft is always the same, irrespective of aircraft angle.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYosG.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYosG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
So for your eyes there is no apparent tilt, the inner ear senses rearwards force, and there is increased pressure from the seat backrest. The brain translates this into perceived forward acceleration.</p>

"How are brakes cooled on heavy aircraft?","12618","","<p>As kinetic energy is not stored or recycled, large quantities of heat have to be evacuated in a short period of time when aircraft abort their takeoff or land:</p>

<sup>B777 brake test, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4V680UQ-k"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Youtube</a></sup></p>

<p>Which approximate quantity of energy is transferred to the brakes in a rejected takeoff for heavy aircraft, e.g. B777/A380? What are the typical systems used to cool brakes on these heavy aircraft? Is cooled air or liquid used, or just ram air?</p>
","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <em>order of magnitude</em> of brake energy after a rejected takeoff for a very heavy aircraft is 1 GJ, or 100 MJ per wheel brake.</p>

<p>Aircraft brakes are cooled with ambient air, either through passive airflow or (optionally) through forced air ventilation.</p>

<p><sub>Cutaway drawings of A380 wheel and brake (<a href=""http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/ATR_Brochures-documents/A380_Carbenix_A4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>)</sub></p>

<hr>

<h1>Energy Dissipation</h1>

<p>Takeoff speed for heavy aircraft is about 150 knots or 280 km/h. The maximum speed to reject takeoff ($V_1$) depends on the plane, the load, the wind, and the condition of the runway. Let's assume 150 knots for the sake of a rough energy estimation. </p>

<p>The maximum energy that could be transfered to the brakes is more or less the kinetic energy of the plane at takeoff speed:
$$E_\rm{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$</p>

<p>The actual energy dissipation will be increased by </p>

<ul>
<li>remaining power delivered by engines</li>
<li>tail wind</li>
<li>runway downward slope</li>
</ul>

<p>and decreased by </p>

<ul>
<li>airbrakes</li>
<li>reverse thrust</li>
<li>head wind</li>
<li>runway upward slope</li>
<li>drag</li>
<li>tire heat dissipation and tire wear</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither A380 nor B777 have brakes in the nose gear. (Actually very few heavy aircraft have braked nose wheels. See: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1106/are-there-any-aircraft-with-a-nose-wheel-braking-system"">Are there any aircraft with a nose wheel braking system?</a>)</p>

<h2>Airbus A380</h2>

<p>The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A380</a> is 575 t, and its main gear has 20 wheels. 16 main wheels have brakes and 4 main wheels do not. (See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/33727/why-do-some-a380-main-wheels-have-no-brakes"">Why do some A380 main wheels have no brakes?</a>)</p>

<p>$$E_\rm{TO,max} = 0.5\cdot 5.75\cdot 10^5\,\rm{kg}\cdot\left(\frac{280}{3.6}\frac{\rm{m}}{\rm{s}}\right)^2 = 1.7\,\rm{GJ}$$</p>

<p>The approximate maximum dissipated energy per wheel brake unit for an A380 after RTO is
$$E_{\rm{wheel}} = \frac{1}{16} E_\rm{TO,max} = 110\,\rm{MJ} $$</p>

<h2>Boeing 777</h2>

<p>The MTOW of the heaviest <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">777</a> is  352 t, and its main gear has 12 wheels. </p>

<p>$$E_\rm{TO,max} = 0.5\cdot 3.52\cdot 10^5\,\rm{kg}\cdot\left(\frac{280}{3.6}\frac{\rm{m}}{\rm{s}}\right)^2 = 1.1\,\rm{GJ}$$</p>

<p>The approximate maximum dissipated energy per wheel brake unit for a Boing 777 after RTO is
$$E_{\rm{wheel}} = \frac{1}{12} E_\rm{TO,max} = 89\,\rm{MJ} $$</p>

<h1>Active Cooling</h1>

<p>Aircraft which are foreseen to take-off and land frequently may be equipped with electric brake cooling fans (BCF) which extract the interior hot air to the exterior. The BCF are used during ground time to shorten the turn-around time.</p>

<p>As an example, the main wheels of an A318 equipped with electric brake cooling fans:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rhjw6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rhjw6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a difference between steel and carbon brake disks. Steel disks wear out faster when hot, whereas carbon disks wear out faster when cold. Therefore it is preferable to reduce the cooling of carbon disk brakes to what is required for the following takeoff (<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/33048/17780"">see this answer</a>).</p>

<h1>Passive Cooling</h1>

<p>Many (long range) aircraft have no active brake cooling. Passive cooling is caused by</p>

<ul>
<li>airstream (induced by wind or aircraft motion),</li>
<li>convection,</li>
<li>thermal conduction,</li>
<li>thermal radiation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Passive cooling of aircraft brakes follows <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Newton's law of cooling</a>, which is - in terms of mathematics - an exponential decay (or exponential function with a negative exponent, if you prefer).</p>

<p>It may take many hours of passive cooling to reach the ambient temperature.

"Why don't airliners use in-air refueling systems?","12595","","<p>Right now if an airliner wants to fly a really long distance (eg., a Boeing 787 flying from Seattle to Tokyo), it has to load itself down with lots and lots of fuel, which in turn weighs thousands and thousands of pounds.  This, of course, makes the flight of the aircraft less efficient than it could be<sup>1</sup>.  Thus, if the craft could theoretically carry half as much fuel, that should increase the fuel efficiency of the craft, right?<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Mid-way refueling seems like it would be a <em>Good Idea</em>™ at that point.  Of course, landing would add a heck of a lot of time to the flight, so it seems the better option would be mid-air refueling.  It would allow for the aircraft to be more efficient, without the need for stopping on a long journey.</p>

<p>Boeing and Airbus both make <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress"">a few airplanes</a> | <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A400M_Atlas"">that can do</a> | <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IauN-Bv0tY"">mid-air refueling</a>, in fact one of them is a highly modified 747-200 (properly called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_VC-25"">VC-25</a>) used as Air Force One:</p>

<p>I assume that, because Airbus and Boeing's engineers and sales managers are really quite smart, they have a really good reason that they don't fit/sell this feature on any civilian transportation aircraft.  But I'm not sure what that reason is.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why airlines do not use aircraft that are capable of mid-air refueling?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>If I'm not mistaken, increased weight means an increased AoA to maintain level flight, which in turn increases induced drag from the wing.  Less fuel would mean less induced drag or, if mid-air refueling were common practice, a wing that was designed to be more efficient because it was required to handle less weight.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>I don't know by how much, if it's not that much, well, that might explain why nobody does this.</em></p>
","<p><strong>Fuel Quantity</strong> Unlike smaller fighter jets, you would need to offload a substantial quantity of fuel. For a B777, you're looking in the range of 60 tonnes of fuel for half a tank. The boom of a KC-135 (faster than a basket) can do around 3 tonnes a minute. The math comes to then 20 minutes of aerial refuelling. The KC-46 can do perhaps 180 tonnes, so you might squeeze out three refuelling operations from one flight.</p>

<p><strong>Risk</strong> This is considerably more dangerous than the very conservative safety margins aircraft normally operate within. You would have one aircraft filled to the brim with fuel, and another aircraft with 300+ passengers. A quick search on YouTube is enough to propose this entire thing is very dangerous.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you need to consider that the aircraft needs safety margin to divert should refuelling not work, which cuts into the benefits you can expect.</p>

<p>Many intercontinental routes will be flown at night, making the manoeuvre more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Refuelling Area</strong> Looking at the route you proposed, the closest airfield would probably be in Alaska, at least 500km away. Guess another relevant area would be Iceland/Greenland. Even if you did reroute, you'd get away from the jetstreams that aircraft over the Pacific use lying considerably further south, reducing efficiency. The same scenario applies for eastbound Atlantic flights.</p>

<p><strong>Expensive</strong> You would need to get another aircraft (~$200m for a KC-46) with special equipment and crew training. The receiving aircraft crew would also  need special training. The airframe modifications would be complicated and require certification. Furthermore, you would need to get everybody to agree on some common standard.</p>

<p><strong>Logistics</strong> Planning is difficult. Each aircraft would have to be rerouted to intercept the tanker at a certain time and place. You want to refuel them perfectly one after an other, which is almost certainly not possible. There's just not the volume of aircraft movements feasible for this, especially for the ultra-long flights where it may have the greatest benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Other Landing Benefits</strong> 
Include changing crews and possibly offloading passengers.</p>

<p><strong>Applicability</strong>
The number of flights where this can be practically implemented and used is very limited and for all intents and purposes, you can just land the plane itself and refuel it. Even for the route you propose, it's around 7,500 km which is not a lot for a B777.</p>

<p>Just to be clear I'm not asking about airport parking etc. but how the owner of the aircraft will charge when it is not flying.</p>
","<p>Flying clubs and aircraft renters generally only charge for the time the plane is actually in use. In the U.S. at least, this is commonly measured using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbs_meter"">Hobbs time</a> (actual clock time used, triggered by oil pressure or some other indicator that the plane is ""in use""), or by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tach_Timer"">Tach time</a>, which is a bit trickier but can very roughly be thought of as the amount of wear you've put on the engine. (Strictly speaking it's a count of the number of engine revolutions, converted to ""hours at cruise RPM"".)</p>

<p>For overnight or longer trips, it's common to find a <em>minimum hourly usage per day</em>. For example, if you take a plane on a 3-day trip, and your club/owner requires 2 hours/day, you will be paying for 2 x 3 = 6 hours of Tach / Hobbs / whatever time, even if you didn't actually use the plane that much. You'll pay for the higher of your <em>actual</em> usage or your <em>minimum usage per day</em>.</p>

<p>It's extremely rare in the U.S., but not unheard-of, to encounter an extra fixed fee per day for taking the airplane for more than one day. (I've never personally encountered a fixed fee like this.) I'm not sure if things are different in the U.K.</p>

<p>Hourly rates can also either be ""wet"" (the rate includes fuel: any amount you pay for fuel will be deducted from your rental fee when you return) or ""dry"" (the rate includes the airplane only and you must pay for fuel). ""Dry"" rentals may or may not also require you to pay for oil or other consumables used.</p>

<p>(This is general information. Of course, if your question is specifically about Fly ASG's policies and fee scales, your best bet is to contact them directly. I know nothing about them.)</p>

"Why are fuel tanks in the wings filled first, and why are they used last?","12449","","<p>When fueling airliners, why is fuel filled first in the tanks in the wings and then the center tanks? And why do they use fuel from the center tanks first and then from the tanks in the wings?</p>

<p>From my research I've found the purpose is not to give too much stress to the structure of the wings, but I don't understand exactly how it works. How does having fuel first in the wings and leaving it last in the wings help protect the structure of the wings?</p>
","<p>It's for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-fuel_weight#Wing_bending_relief"" rel=""noreferrer"">wing bending relief</a> (for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_configuration#Wing_support"" rel=""noreferrer"">cantilevered wings</a>). As the generated lift bends the wings upward, the weight of the fuel will counter that.</p>

<p>As the plane loses weight in-flight due to burning fuel, so does the need for wing bending relief (less weight → less lift), that's why the wing tanks are the last to be used.</p>

<p>For context, a Boeing 777-200ER can hold 29 tonnes of fuel in each wing, and each wing measures ~27 metres and is self-supported.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Let's say in our airliner each wing tank holds 100 units (200 total for both tanks), and the center tank holds 200 units, and you have a flight that needs 200 units of fuel.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Correct scenario: By filling only the wing tanks, the weight of fuel in the wings will counter the bending of the lift.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorrect scenario: By filling only the center tank, the wings will bend a great deal (maybe even beyond their design limit). This is not good, and even if it is within the design limits, the repeating [avoidable] stresses will shorten the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/2263/14897"">plane's lifespan</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example for order of use (schedule):</strong></p>

<p>Our flight needs 300 units, based on the above, we will fill the wing tanks, and fill half the center tank.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Correct order: By emptying the center first, we have extended the duration of the wing bending relief.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorrect order: By emptying the wings first, we lose the wing bending relief, while the plane is still heavy.</p></li>

"How does wind affect the airspeed that I should fly for maximum range in an airplane?","12420","","<p>I have heard that wind affects the actual airspeed that I should fly for maximum range in an aircraft. </p>

<p>I understand that wind will not affect the airspeed that I should fly if I am looking for maximum endurance, but what about maximum range? </p>

<p>How (and how much) should airspeed be adjusted for wind in order to get maximum range? </p>
","<p>My answer was rather concise first, and I got the impression that I need to elaborate the question first. The question is about the best airspeed for maximum range. With wind. Best range means you cover the most distance while the wind is carrying the plane with it. If you have a headwind, the longer you stay aloft, the more you are carried back, so you better hurry up. With a tailwind, it helps to slow down because now the wind is helping you to cover even more distance.</p>

<p>But how much? We need to pick that particular speed where the change in fuel consumption just balances the change in speed over ground. I always found that easier to explain with gliders, and there you can really observe which polar point is best. Just picture yourself as an observer on the ground who sees the plane fly by in the distance. If you plot a line with the combination of positions and altitude, there must be one flight speed that produces a line where the flight path angle is the shallowest. This is the desired optimum. That has only little to do with optimum L/D - this is just one other point you can find with a sink speed polar. And it happens to be the point for best glide in still air. But there is so much more that humble polar will tell you, if you look at it the right way.</p>

<p>With powered aircraft you need to pick the polar point where your fuel flow is lowest for the given speed over ground. Basically, you fly like the glider and add enough power to stay at the same altitude. That is all the difference. User2168 has answered that part already with a graphical solution.</p>

<p>OK, now back to gliders. Please look at the plot below which shows airspeed on the X axis and sink speed on the Y axis.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E5kUv.png"" alt=""Optimum Speed for Best Range""></p>

<p>The solution is graphical: You start on the X-axis at the point which corresponds to the wind speed and put a tangent on the sink speed graph. Where the tangent touches the sink polar (blue line), the plane flies at the best L/D for that given wind speed. Move the starting point to positive speeds for headwind and to negative speeds (not shown here) for tailwind. If the term ""best L/D"" is already reserved in your mind, please read this as the ""best polar point"". It is really the same.</p>

<p>Since User2168 has beaten me to the graphical solution, I will add an analytical solution.</p>

<p>For powered flight things become more tricky, because thrust changes with speed. To simplify things, we can say that thrust changes over speed in proportion to the expression $v^{n_v}$ where $n_v$ is a constant which depends on engine type. Piston aircraft have constant power output, and thrust is inverse with speed over the speed range of acceptable propeller efficiencies, hence $n_v$ becomes -1 for piston aircraft. Turboprops make some use of ram pressure, so they profit a little from flying faster, but not much. Their $n_v$ is -0.8 to -0.6. Turbofans are better in utilizing ram pressure, and their $n_v$ is -0.5 to -0.2. The higher the bypass ratio, the more negative their $n_v$ becomes. Jets (think J-79 or even the old Jumo-004) have constant thrust over speed, at least in subsonic flow. Their $n_v$ is approximately 0. Positive values of $n_v$ can be found with ramjets - they develop more thrust the faster they move through the air.</p>

<p>Now for fuel flow: This goes up and down with the power output of the engine. Again a simplification, but it helps to get to grips with the problem and gives useful results. This lets us re-formulate the problem as: At what airspeed do I have the best ratio between power and ground speed? </p>

<p>Mathematically, we want to fly with $\frac{P}{v_w+v}$ at the lowest possible value. $P$ is the power, $v_w$ is the wind speed and $v$ the airspeed. To express the thrust behavior over speed, I break P up into a product of a constant $K_S$, the throttle setting $\delta$ and the speed like this: $K_S\cdot\delta\cdot v\cdot v^{n_v}$. Here is the general solution, pasted as a PNG to save me all the typing in the editor:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5UR8.png"" alt=""formulas""></p>

<p>Please note that implicitly the lift coefficient is on both sides of the equation. To solve it, you need to do it recursively, until speed and lift coefficient match. I took this form because of the similarity to the general form at still wind which can be found in many performance books. This here I didn't find anywhere, and it took me a while to figure it out. Thank you, Lnafziger, for the excellent question! It gave me a chance to learn something.</p>

<p>Now I have put the results into a plot. In order to eliminate the aircraft-specific parameters, it shows the ratio of $c_L$ with wind over $c_L$ without wind. The plot is metric, but will work for all units if you use the same units for wind speed and air speed.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cp0CY.png"" alt=""best cl over speed""></p>

<p>To give an example for the application of the correction factor: If you are flying in a 20 m/s headwind and your best range speed at still wind is 50 m/s (approx 97 kts), the $c_L$ needs to be 70% of the $c_L$ at still wind for piston-powered aircraft. This makes your corrected airspeed 60 m/s (v is proportional to $\sqrt{c_L}$), and now the recursive nature of the formula rears its ugly head. At 60 m/s, the correction is only 77.5%, so we need to do a few loops until we arrive at a point where the airspeed and the correction factor match. In this example, this would be 57 m/s or 110 kts in case of a piston-powered aircraft.</p>

"Is gravity less on an airliner at cruise altitude?","12415","","<p>Is the force of gravity less on an airliner at cruise speed and altitude? I'm not talking about a special reduced gravity flight with a parabolic flight path, just a typical long distance flight.</p>

<p>Seems to me there should be less as passengers are further away from the centre of the earth, and also possibly a tiny effect from the speed the plane as it travels round the curve of the earth (altitude remaining constant) but does anybody actually know how much less?</p>
","<p>There is less gravitational force, but by how much? An insignificant amount.
The gravitational force of attraction between two objects is given by,</p>

<p>$\displaystyle F_{\mathrm g} = \frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{R^2}$,</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>$G$ is the graviational constant,</p>

<p>$R$ is the distance between the object's centers, and</p>

<p>$m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are the masses of the objects.</p>

<p>Instead of finding the variation in force between the aircraft and earth, it would be be better to find the variation in the acceleration due to gravity, $g$ (as $F_{\mathrm g} = m_{\mathrm a} g$, with $m_{\mathrm a}$ being the mass of the airliner)</p>

<p>We have, on earth's surface,</p>

<p>$\displaystyle g = \frac{G m_{\mathrm e}}{R_{\mathrm e}^2}$ </p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>$m_{\mathrm e}$ is the mass of the earth, and</p>

<p>$R_{\mathrm e}$ is the radius of the earth.</p>

<p>For the aircraft at an altitude $h$ above the surface of the earth, this becomes,</p>

<p>$\displaystyle g_{h} = \frac{G m_{\mathrm e}}{\left(R_{\mathrm e} + h\right)^2}$</p>

<p>Taking ratio, we get,</p>

<p>$\displaystyle \frac{g_{h}}{g} = \left(1 + \frac{h}{R_{e}}\right)^{-2}$</p>

<p>Plugging in numbers, we get, for an airliner cruising at 12 km,</p>

<p>$g_{h} = 9.773\ \mathrm{m\ s^{-2}}$,</p>

<p>or about 0.37 % less compared to the sea level value. This is quite small and would not be noticable to all but the sensitive instruments.</p>

"What is the EASA definition of night time?","12382","","<p>EASA requires pilots to log night time and night landings seperate in the personal logbook. Now I'm not sure in which period of time a landing is a night landing and flight time is night flight time. I would appreciate your answer, mabe also with a trustworthy source. </p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.easa.europa.eu/agency-measures/docs/opinions/2011/04/Annexes%20to%20Regulation.pdf"">this handy document from EASA</a>, <code>night</code> is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the period between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, or such other period between sunset and sunrise as may be prescribed by the appropriate authority, as defined by the Member State.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The FAA and ICAO use a similar definition.)</p>

<hr>

<p>You can get the Civil Twilight times from <a href=""http://www.sunrisesunset.com/predefined.asp"">a convenient astronomical calendar</a>, but ignoring the specifics, the same rule of thumb the FAA uses for purposes of night currency will likely work for you too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Night starts one hour after sunset<br>
(Sunset being when the last of the visible sun disc drops below the horizon.)</li>
<li>Night ends one hour before sunrise<br>
(Sunrise being when the first of the visible sun disk breaks the horizon.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This actually cheats you out of a few minutes of ""night"" on either side of the calculation, but it's conservative guidance if you're conservative in what you log you won't accidentally mess up and give yourself more night time than you're really entitled too (i.e. you won't make yourself ""night current"" when you really aren't).</p>

"How does a large cargo plane like the C-130 Hercules take off and land in such a short distance?","12370","","<p>So I was at an air show and saw a C-130J Super Hercules showcasing its capabilities.</p>

<p>The take-off distance it covered was amazingly short (I guess equal to fighter jets), even though it uses propeller based engines. The landing was also super short.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How does such a massive plane manage to take off in short distances ? Is it because it has four engines?</li>
<li>During landing, I couldn't see any thrust reverser (as in commercial jets) in play. What tech does it use to stop so quickly?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Takeoff and landing distance have a lot of variables.</p>

<p>One is certainly thrust. The plane is designed such that it has enough thrust to reach takeoff speed within the available takeoff distance. For landing, the propellers are able to reverse the thrust and add extra braking power to stop in a shorter distance.</p>

<p>Another variable is landing and takeoff speed. If you lower takeoff and landing speeds, it takes less distance to get going and to stop. Being a propeller plane with a straight (non-swept) wing, it is designed to fly slower than jet aircraft. This means the plane needs less angle of attack to fly at slower speeds. The C-130 also has very large flaps for this purpose, and they contribute to lowering takeoff and landing airspeeds in two ways. First, the flaps are very large, which adds more wing area and also deflects more air downwards, increasing lift. Second, the flaps are placed directly behind the engines, which allows the flaps to direct some of the engine thrust downwards, further increasing lift.</p>

<p>Weight is also important. While the C-130 is designed for good performance at 155,000 lb, and can fly at up to 175,000 lb, it will be much lighter in a demonstration. From an empty weight of 75,562 lb, fuel and crew will still leave it well below its typical operating weights. The lower weight means that takeoff performance will be increased by better acceleration and a lower liftoff speed. Landing performance will also be better with a lower landing speed and better deceleration.</p>

<p>The newer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_C-130J_Super_Hercules#Specifications_.28C-130J.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">C-130J</a> also performs better than the older <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules#Specifications_.28C-130H.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">C-130H</a>. The newer engines on the J model produce up to 4,637 shaft horsepower (shp) each (though they are listed <a href=""https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1419/SRG_PRO_Ptcds116iss7.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> at 4,705 shp), while the engines on the H model produce up to 4,590 shp each. The empty weight on the J model is 75,562 lb and on the H model is 75,800 lb. So with the empty weight going down by 238 lb and the power increasing by at least 47 shp, and improved propellers, the J model has better performance. The takeoff distance at 155,000 lb is 3,127 feet for the J model versus 3,586 feet for the H model. The H model can take off in 1,400 feet at 80,000 lb (probably closer to the weight in demonstrations), so the J model can probably do even better.</p>

<p>Is it because of the mountains? In my opinion, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Juliana_International_Airport"">Princess Juliana International Airport</a> is also as challenging as Paro.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do the pilots need a special certification to land there? </li>
<li>How do they achieve this certificate?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The approach to Paro is unbelievably complicated. It is flown visually through a valley with high mountains all around and <em>no sight of the airport until the last moment.</em> Here is a cut of a map with the approach paths:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ME7hh.png"" alt=""Area around Paro Airport (from Google Map) with approach directions""></p>

<p>Approach to runway 15, marked in red, is worse in this regard. The ridge is rather close to the airport, so the final turn usually ends over the runway threshold. The wings get level with 30–50 ft (10–15 m) remaining only (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmGy7qcDwQU"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's a video</a>). The approach to runway 33, marked in blue, allows a bit more of a straight final, but not by much. In either case the aircraft must emerge from the turn with correct altitude, speed and rate of descent. So the pilot has to know landmarks in the valley and how to judge correct approach profile by them. The approaches also often involve turning around higher in the valleys which again must be done by landmarks at places where it is known to be possible. It is this knowledge pilots have to demonstrate before they can attempt the approach (as pilots in command).</p>

<p>There are other airports where pilots have to receive special training to be permitted to fly there, for example the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samedan_Airport"" rel=""noreferrer"">Samedan Airport</a> near St. Moritz in Switzerland, which is similar mix of high altitude, high mountains around and visual approach, though it's still a lot easier as the airport is visible from much greater distance.</p>

<p>There is however nothing similarly difficult on Princess Juliana Airport. It appears approaches to Princess Juliana are only flown to runway 10 and these are over flat sea and flat beach. The runway is visible from great distance and the approach is straight. The featureless water makes it slightly harder to judge height than solid ground, but that's what the approach lights (VASI/PAPI) and distance-altitude table are for (there is no ILS at TNCM, only VOR-DME). And there are many airports with approach over water, so it's nothing unusual for the pilots. If there was approach to runway 28, it would have to be off-axis to avoid the hills on the island, but it does not appear to be used at all.</p>

<p>They couldn't fly with the training captain in the other seat, because they were ATR-42 pilots and the training captain flies A320-family (and possibly still has rating for the older BAe146, but not ATR-42).</p>

<p>He also wrote that while on early flights when temperatures are still low the performance is good, later in the day it becomes marginal and they often needed to follow the valley quite far before they managed to climb above the mountains. Careful planning and weight and balance calculation was always necessary.</p>

","<p>The engine in a typical light airplane (say a Cessna 172 or a Piper Cherokee) has a lot in common with the engine in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle"">classic 1960s VW Beetle (Type 1)</a>: Both engines are horizontally opposed four-stroke four-cylinder spark ignition gasoline engines. Their parts even have similar metallurgy, and broadly similar failure rates.<br>
In fact if you remove the gearbox and install a magneto ignition system <a href=""http://www.eaa.ca/experimenter/articles/2010-02_powerplants.asp"">you basically have one of several ""Volkswagen aircraft engines""</a> that are popular in the experimental market, and have proven to be <em>very</em> reliable if well-maintained.</p>

<p><em>Certificated</em> aircraft engines (the Lycoming and Continentals you would find in our hypothetical Piper or Cessna) have a few other features not found on a Volkswagen engine: They have dual ignition systems (two magnetos, two spark plugs per cylinder) for redundancy in case one fails, and an oil sump designed to hold at least twice the capacity of oil needed for safe operation. They typically also have a manual mixture control to allow the pilot to lean the fuel/air mixture as they climb (the VW Beetle generally didn't get too high above sea level, and when they did the local mechanic could adjust the mixture in the garage because those cars would probably stay at a relatively high altitude for most of their life - aircraft have an annoying habit of climbing and descending <em>a lot</em>, so either a manual mixture control or an <em>altitude-compensating</em> carburetor is necessary).</p>

<p>So what accounts for the price difference? Three things: FAA Certification, Volume, and Liability.</p>

<p>FAA Certificated engines cost quite a bit of money: The manufacturer needs to thoroughly document their design and manufacturing practices, and ensure the engine meets the design requirements and can pass the tests described in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt14.1.33&amp;rgn=div5"">FAR 33</a>. Doing (and documenting) all of this to the FAA's satisfaction is not a small burden, and it adds to the cost of the final product.</p>

<p>Volume is the next problem: As a reward for complying with Part 33 and getting your engine certified you now have the opportunity to sell your engine. To a very small market. There are far fewer piston aircraft than cars, and although piston aircraft engines are often ""worn out"" over the life of an airframe most owners overhaul their engines rather than replacing the whole engine outright. As a result the volume of new engine production is relatively low (and with relatively brisk competition in the overhaul market the manufacturer isn't even guaranteed a substantial amount of <em>that</em> business). As with any other product, when volume is small price goes up to allow a profit.</p>

<p>Liability is the last (and probably largest) factor affecting pricing: Jane Q. Pilot is flying along in his brand new just-off-the-production-line Cessna with her two kids and the family dog when the engine fails. She is unable to make a successful landing, and everyone dies, whereupon her bereaved and distraught husband John immediately sues the mechanic who last worked on the plane, Cessna (who made the airframe), and Lycoming (who made the engine).<br>
Being ready to deal with this kind of high-profile and high-cost event requires a substantial legal team (the cost of which is built into each engine sold), and as the manufacturer is accepting a substantial risk the price gets bumped a bit more to provide a balancing reward (profit).</p>

<hr>

<p>So to answer your bullet-pointed questions which I largely ignored in the explanation above:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Are aircraft engine parts expected to be less likely to fail?</strong><br>
We may have this expectation given the price tag, but in reality they're probably about as reliable as any other well-maintained air-cooled 1960s engine design.  A modern car engine has a number of design and technological advantages over the typical piston aircraft engine, and if we equipped them with dual independent ignition systems and gave them the kind of maintenance aircraft engines get they may well beat aircraft engines in terms of reliability. (Of course a modern car engine also weighs a lot more than a typical aircraft engine, so some money would have to be spent making it lighter without sacrificing that reliability.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is done to allow the engine to function at extreme temperatures / altitudes / air densities?</strong><br>
Surprisingly little: The addition of a mixture control for the carburetor, dual independent ignition systems, and a healthy weight consciousness pretty much covers it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do changes have to be made to allow a piston engine to function while upside down (in a roll)?</strong><br>
Yes (the fuel and lubrication systems for need to be designed to handle zero / negative G loads for an extended period of time), but your typical piston aircraft engine isn't designed to function while upside down: Aerobatic aircraft engines are a slightly different beast, and they cost a little more than their non-aerobatic counterparts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What components are different on an aircraft vs automotive piston engine (magnetos vs. spark plugs, oil system)?</strong><br>
The biggest difference between a 1960s VW engine on a classic Beetle and a 2015 Lycoming O-320 is the dual magneto ignition system. The rest of the parts are largely identical, or at least analogous: Spark plugs look like spark plugs, cylinders look like cylinders, carburetors look like carburetors, etc.<br>
Aircraft engines are also designed for component swaps: Cylinders can be easily unbolted and replaced for example, as can the magnetos, the oil pump, the carburetor, the starter, etc.</p></li>

"What are the advantages of twin-fuselage aircraft?","12288","","<p>During WWII, there were a number of twin-fuselage aircraft (notably bombers but some fighters). They were made by apparently combining two existing single-fuselage aircraft bodies together:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhnF3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Twin-fuselages seemed to disappear after the 1960s but  recently, Virgin Galactic has come out with a twin-fuselage aircraft, the WhiteKnightTwo. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/npyZE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I understand the Virgin design as the space module (SpaceShipTwo) is designed to fit between the two fuselages. But aside from that special case, are there any advantages to twin-fuselage aircraft? </p>

<p>Was their design and introduction in the 1930s-1950s merely a strange historical accident (and if so, what was the reason d'etre then) or do they currently or potentially have advantages over single-fuselages such that we might see their return?</p>
","<p>Depending on the design, one of three advantages made designers choose a twin-boom layout:</p>

<ol>
<li>No structure directly aft of the fuselage, which helped to integrate the propulsion, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_C-82_Packet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">improved access to the cargo area</a>, or improved <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_189"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pilot vision</a>,</li>
<li>Smaller overall surface area for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">two-engine aircraft</a>, or</li>
<li>Shorter development time for high-performance aircraft.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two groups of twin boom designs: Those which were designed that way from the outset, and those which were later derived from single-fuselage designs. You could add a third group, those with two distinct fuselages and an offset pilot position, but an offset cockpit could also be a result of other design considerations. Examples are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_322"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Junkers 322</a> or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blohm_%26_Voss_BV_141"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blohm&amp;Voss BV 141</a>, both single-fuselage designs with an offset cockpit.</p>

<p>The first group comprises aircraft like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airco_DH.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">D.H. 2</a>, the Saab 21 (picture below, <a href=""http://www.airwar.ru/image/idop/fww2/j21/j21-4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>) or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotha_Go_242"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gotha Go-242</a>. Here the designers wanted to create space for the propeller or a loading ramp. Also, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Vampire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some early jet aircraft</a> used a two-boom layout to keep the tail structure free of the jet blast. The advantage is obvious: No structure at the rear fuselage.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PuI3K.jpg"" alt=""Saab-21""></p>

<p>The second group arose due to the performance requirements of modern, all-metal, stressed-skin designs with cantilevered wings. Remember that at the beginning of the 1930s fighters were still biplanes (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Fury"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hawker Fury</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_51"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heinkel He-51</a>), and new designs like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudron_C.460"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Caudron 460</a> or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_108"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Messerschmitt Bf-108</a> showed that sleek aerodynamics and high wing loading were the way ahead. However, unlocking the performance potential possible with these designs required much more powerful engines. The engine manufacturers could increase power output only slowly, so a number of designs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lockheed P-38</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_110"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Messerschmitt Me-110</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Beaufighter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bristol Beaufighter</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_P-61_Black_Widow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Northrop P-61</a>) tried to use two engines. Since there were two engines already with a big space requirement for the turbocharger, Lockheed decided to use a two-tailboom design. Here the advantage was a smaller overall surface area to house two engines, their coolers and turbochargers, and the pilot (picture below, <a href=""http://www.thunderace.org/images/P38/P38.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g0SNu.jpg"" alt=""P-38 in flight""></p>

<p>During the war, again the requirement for more powerful aircraft arose, and to avoid the delay of a fully new design, existing aircraft were combined, shortening the development time greatly. The first of those was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_111#He_111H_and_its_variants"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heinkel He-111 Z</a> (for Zwilling = Twin), which added a fifth engine to be able to pull the giant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_321"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Me-321 transport glider</a>. Joining two powerful aircraft was proposed for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Messerschmitt Bf-109</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109_variants#Bf_109Z_.22Zwilling.22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bf-109 Z</a>), the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_309"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Messerschmitt  Me-309</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_609"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Me 609</a>), the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_Do_335"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dornier Do 335</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_Do_635"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Do 635</a>), the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoia-Marchetti_SM.92"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Savoia-Marchetti SM.92</a> and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">North American P-51</a>, the only one of those to result in an operational aircraft, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_F-82_Twin_Mustang"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F-82</a>. This resulted in an agile aircraft with high speed and high range, which was very useful for escort or reconnaissance tasks. However, only few of those were used operationally, because soon jet aircraft filled that need in a better way.</p>

<p>The main disadvantages of the twin fuselage designs with their offset pilot position is the high radius of roll inertia and the vertical acceleration suffered by the pilot during rolling maneuvers. Especially for a fighter, a fast roll response is the key to success in aerial combat, and a twin fuselage will impose a penalty not suffered by a two-engined aircraft with a central fuselage. This is compounded by the pilot suffering additional vertical acceleration when rolling, which again will reduce the likely roll agility of the twin-fuselage aircraft.</p>

<p>Might we see more twin-boom or twin-fuselage designs in the future? Probably only for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutan_Voyager"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">special purposes</a>, like the example you have given yourself. Another might be the Kensgaila VK-7, a Lithuanian airfoil testbed which combines two <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LET_L-13_Blan%C3%ADk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blanik gliders</a> with a special, exchangeable center section for testing new airfoils under realistic conditions. This one is not even on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-fuselage_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia's list of twin-fuselage aircraft</a>!</p>

<p>Earlier twin-boom transport aircraft like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_C-119_Flying_Boxcar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fairchild C-119</a> or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Noratlas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nord Noratlas</a> have given way to conventional layouts with a raised tail to accommodate the rear ramp. Twin-boom and twin-fuselage designs are less stiff and more prone to flutter than conventional configurations, so the conventional design prevailed and will do so in future as well.</p>

<p>Let's say I happen to spot a fine-looking plane at my local airport and decide the owner probably wouldn't mind if I borrowed her for a little while - what stops me from stealing this plane? On commercial jets, the cockpit door is locked, but as I understand smaller planes don't have cockpit doors. The linked question suggests that single-engine planes have ignition keys, but twin-engine planes don't. Are the outer doors (cabin doors) locked?

"Do turbine engines on multi-engine aircraft rotate in opposite directions to offset torque?","12233","","<p>I'm not an aviator, I guess I'd call myself an enthusiast. I'm also a physics nut. I've always wondered about this but I equally worried my question posed to a commercial airline crew would land me in the Homeland Security Suites.</p>

<p>On helicopters, torque along the vertical axis is countered by a smaller tail rotor (or a twin main rotor rotating in the opposite direction).</p>

<p>My question is whether the turbines/fans of multi-engine jet aircraft rotate in the same direction. I.e., do both the port engine and the starboard engine rotate uniformly clockwise or counterclockwise?</p>

<p>It seems like if that were the case then maintenance might be easier but it would create some instability along the longitudinal axis of the airframe due to torque and moment arms.</p>

<p>Follow up: I guess, then, that single engine propeller aircraft utilize trim presets to compensate for the longitudinal torque generated by their propeller–correct?</p>
","<p>Engines on airliners turn the same direction. The torque isn't as much an issue on jets as it is on props.</p>

<p>A lot of multiengine prop planes have propellers that turn in opposite directions. In turbine engines this can be done in a gearbox to allow the same engine to be used on both sides.</p>

<p>Some turbine engines, such as the PT6, have two turbines turning in opposite directions, but the propeller friction produces additional torque in one direction.</p>

<p>Single engine planes sometimes have the engine mounted at a slight angle to reduce the effect of the propwash (and maybe torque?). The propwash causes imbalance at low speed and high power when the descending blade tends to push air down over the wing on that side, and and vice versa for the ascending blade.</p>

<p>Immediately after takeoff, the rudder of a single engine plane is normally depressed, to some extent, to make up for the uneven torque and propwash. This may be done manually, with trim settings, or both.</p>

<p>At higher speeds, the effect of the propeller torque is not as noticeable because the wings are held ""more tightly"" by the airflow.</p>

"Do helicopters use more fuel when hovering?","12160","","<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/44744/1467"">This answer</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A helicopter uses a LOT more fuel hovering than it does in forward flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? Why?</p>
","<p>Yes it is correct that helicopters use more fuel when hovering: the engine needs to apply more power to overcome drag. Here is a graph of the engine power required for different airspeeds, from J. Gordon Leishman, Principles Of Helicopter Aerodynamics:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0zIO7.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0zIO7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The line for total power goes down between 0 - 70 kts with increasing airspeed, this is caused by the line for induced power: power required to overcome the induced drag of the helicopter blade. The total required engine power is the summation of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Induced power. The power required to overcome the induced drag of lift creation, further detailed below. Propulsive power relates to the engine exhaust velocity now being helpful, and to the rise in induced power at higher speeds due to compressibility drag.</li>
<li>Profile power, required for the blade profile drag.</li>
<li>Parasitic power, for the drag caused by the air frame, rotor hub etc. Zero in the hover, very dominant at top speed. Helicopters have shapes that are way less aerodynamic than fixed wing planes, and this source of drag becomes very significant at higher speeds.</li>
<li>Tail rotor power. Up to 20% of the main rotor power both in the hover and at top speed, very low in the middle due to the helpful vertical tail. At top speed the torque of the main rotor is high and the tail rotor must do more work, unless the vertical tail can be adjusted.  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0dmF.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0dmF.png"" alt=""from Wikipedia for induced drag""></a></p>

<p>Induced power is dominant in the hover. Induced drag is caused by the backwards tilt of the lift vector: the higher the angle between blade and free stream, the more the vector is tilted backwards, which causes both loss of lift and increase of drag. The equation for lift L is:</p>

<p>$$ L = C_L \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot V^2 \cdot S$$</p>

<p>and at a given altitude, the two variables here are $C_L$ (lift coefficient) and $V$ (airspeed at the blade). $C_L$ is an approximately linear function of angle of attack at the blade, so lift increases linearly with blade tilt-back and quadratically with increasing airspeed over the blade.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bu8se.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bu8se.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Above graph from Leishman shows the velocity distribution over the blades when hovering, and at airspeed. Quite a complicated situation - when hovering, the airspeed reaching the blade is only the rotational speed of the rotor, at forward speed the blade going forward has rotational speed plus airspeed. </p>

<p>The helicopter does not roll over and both forward blade and retreating blade deliver the same amount of lift, with the rearward going blade tilted back more than it was in the hover. But the forward going blade is tilted back a lot less: airspeed has a quadratic influence.</p>

<p>Note that the circle in the plot at fwd airspeed is not stalled flow, but reverse flow: the air streams in at the back of the blade. So drag is now negative, the airstream helps to propel the blade! However there is loss of lift in the reverse flow area.</p>

<p>Induced power reduces with airspeed at first according to the simple 1-D impulse consideration (more air mass through the disk), and later increases as the disk is increasingly tilted forward and must do more work to overcome losses from rotor profile drag, airframe parasitic drag, and compressibility drag.</p>

<p>There is also an interference effect of the downwash over the fuselage: in the hover the air streams straight down, while in forward flight the rotor wash is more aligned with the fuselage, catching more of a streamline shape. Parasitic drag is of course dominant at top speed, while offloading the rotor by using fixed wing surfaces reduces the induced power at high speeds - but from hover to moderate forward speeds it is purely the reduction in lift induced power that creates translational lift.</p>

","<p>All airplanes can glide, if they couldn't they wouldn't be able to fly in the first place. When you glide an aircraft you are converting height into airspeed, which you can use to move across the ground. How far you can go across the ground for height lost is called the glide ratio for the aircraft. Gliders have a very high glide ratio as their wings are designed to provide lots of lift at low speeds, fighters have a very low glide ratio as they are designed to provide lift at a much higher speed enabling the fighter to achieve high airspeeds efficiently. </p>

<p>So a fighter will glide, it just won't be able to glide that far over the ground. If a fighter has enough altitude to trade for speed and a strip close enough by it can be done (and has been done in the past) by a skilled pilot. </p>

<p>Using the equation for estimating root bending moment <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/systems-labs-06/spl10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, and the following numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuselage weight: 230,000 kg

<ul>
<li>MTOW: 577,000 kg</li>
<li>Engines: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Trent#Trent_900"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">25,000 kg</a></li>
<li>Fuel: 260,000 kg</li>
<li>Wings: 60,000 kg</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Wing taper ratio: <a href=""http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~mason/Mason_f/A380Dean.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">0.17</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The equation gives a root bending moment of 17,300,000 Nm. Of course, this is just a static load. If you consider a 2.5 g pullup, this could be 43,300,000 Nm. But on the ground, the wings will bend under their own weight. Running the bending equation on the wing weight, and adding in the engines, gives 23,900,000 Nm in the other direction.</p>

<p>As to how it can be trusted: a <strong>lot</strong> of math. Organizations like EASA expect way more accuracy than my above estimate, which requires analysis of the specific loading conditions that need to be met, both static and dynamic, and the specific design of the wing, structurally and aerodynamically, which is how aerospace engineers earn the big bucks.</p>

<p>Of course the A380 is bigger than anything mass-produced before. But the in-depth analysis will take this into account. Airbus has some experience building large aircraft, so they have a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't. Detailed testing is also done, on everything from the nuts and bolts up to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/9415/1696"">entire airframes</a>. All of this information is used to back up the design. Airbus isn't going to invest money in a large test without being reasonably sure it will work, and EASA isn't going to certify a design until it has been successfully tested. Modern analysis allows predicting pretty accurately where and at what load structure will fail.</p>

<p>But even then, with something so large and complex, things happen. Important things like the wings are required to not fail even if they are damaged, and to have redundant load paths so that even if a part fails, the remaining structure will hold. Parts are inspected to look for damage before it becomes critical. <a href=""http://aviationweek.com/blog/easa-extends-a380-wing-crack-airworthiness-directive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Problems are found</a>. More analysis is done, and fixes are implemented. Usually this won't be an issue of ""the wing can't handle the load"", but that ""the wing wears out too quickly"". <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/9418/1696"">Fatigue</a> is harder to predict and design for.</p>

<p>The FAA requirements are in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.11#se14.1.25_1301"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">14 CFR Part 25</a>. This includes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, a factor of safety of 1.5 must be applied to the prescribed limit load which are considered external loads on the structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they must take the maximum load expected without permanent deformation (limit load), and allow a 1.5 safety factor on top of that without failing (ultimate load). In order to show that the structure is capable of meeting the requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compliance with the strength and deformation requirements of this subpart must be shown for each critical loading condition. Structural analysis may be used only if the structure conforms to that for which experience has shown this method to be reliable. The Administrator may require ultimate load tests in cases where limit load tests may be inadequate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that all analysis has to be shown to be reliable. This must either be tested, or compared to the known performance of previous designs. The testing must also be sufficient to prove the requirements will be met.</p>

"Why do fighter aircraft manufacturers still focus on making their planes more dogfight-worthy?","12076","","<p>In today's age, when dogfights are simply a relic from the past, why do manufacturers keep on increasing their aircraft maneuverability, in order to make them better dogfighters. It is more understandable if they were to make stealthier or more efficient fighters, but when the dogfight is extinct, why make planes even more agile and maneuverable? </p>
","<p>That same thinking, ""dogfighting is dead"", got the USAF and USN in serious trouble in Vietnam. The U.S. Armed Forces were convinced that the next major war would be against the Soviet Union directly, in theaters including Europe, Alaska and Canada, and as a result, fighter designs succeeding the very successful Sabre and Super Sabre day fighters used in Korea began emphasizing standoff capabilities, believing the aerial threat would come from various classes of nuclear bomber, calling for fast, long-range missile-armed interceptors as a counter.</p>

<p>That war, thankfully, never materialized. Instead, the U.S. was pulled into more or less another Korea, a proxy war fought between Soviet-supplied and trained Communist forces against a U.S.-backed fledgling democracy. The big, heavy U.S. F-4 Phantom interceptor and F-105 Thunderchief light bomber, neither of which had internal guns, found themselves facing the older like-minded successor to the MiG-15s they faced in Korea, the MiG-17, coupled with the MiG-21 close-range interceptor. Instead of the long-range standoff air war the USAF was built for, US pilots were ambushed at close range by guns and infrared missiles, resulting in a piss-poor 2:1 kill/death ratio in aerial engagements, compared to the 14:1 ratio they enjoyed in Korea.</p>

<p>The result was increased attention paid to ""air combat maneuvering"", and an emphasis on this style of combat in the next generation of fighters adopted by the U.S. military. The F-14 and F-15, though intended to bring back dogfighting (and they did), turned out to be big, fast interceptor-style fighters like their predecessors, that still only had a clear advantage in BVR engagements. So a group of USAF generals, seeing what its allies had been doing with the F-5 Tiger that the Joint Chiefs had more or less passed on (a few trainers, a few aggressor planes, but no combat adoption), commissioned the LWF competition, which would produce the F-16 and F-18 lightweight multirole fighters with an emphasis on the close-quarters maneuverability that the Communist powers never really forgot. </p>

<p>The F-22 splits the difference between the F-15 and F-16's air combat strategies, producing a heavier but highly maneuverable fighter that excels at air combat at any range (but is so expensive that so far the USAF have only deployed them in situations where they would never face any real threat). The F-35, however, is rapidly becoming a disappointment; compared even to the F-16 or F-15E it will replace, it ""can't climb, can't turn, and can't run"", and the A variant is the only one with an internal cannon (which carries only 182 rounds of ammunition compared to the F-22s 480, the F-15's 650 and the F-16's 510); the STOVL B variant and the Navy's C variant won't have guns at all.</p>

<p>In today's military theater, the U.S. enjoys ""air supremacy""; we're fighting largely paramilitary forces with practically zero air to air capability. Tomorrow's theater, however, may be quite different. Diplomatic relationships with a number of Russian-supplied nations including Russia itself are souring day by day, and the U.S. could easily find itself drawn into conflicts over Taiwan, the Korean peninsula, India/Pakistan, the Ukraine, etc, where they'd face militaries fielding Russian jets purpose-built to mix it up at visual range.</p>

<p>In short, while the U.S. hasn't directly fought a conflict against a serious air threat since Vietnam, there are a lot of potential near-future conflicts in which they would get their chance, facing the Sukhoi PAK-FA or Chengdu J-20 with skilled Chinese or Russian pilots at the stick. Even if these fighters aren't fielded in mass numbers, the U.S. would still face the Russians' direct answers to U.S 4th and 4.5-generation fighters, including the MiG-29 and Su-27/30/33.  Many variants of these were specifically designed to out-maneuver the U.S. F-15, F-16 and F-18 (which would likely be the first jets in-theater), and which would still be a match for the F-22 in a visual-range ""furball"".</p>

"What provides the greatest thrust in a high-bypass turbofan engine?","12071","","<p>I'll try to make as much sense as I can with this question.</p>

<p>I've been flying quite often in 2015, and I have recently wondered this question regarding high-bypass turbofan engines. I know that there are two primary parts to the high-bypass turbofan: the fans themselves that pull air from the front of the aircraft through the engine, and the fraction of that air that gets compressed and undergoes combustion inside the combustion chamber.</p>

<p>Given those two main parts that I know about (or so I think I know about), which provides the greatest amount of thrust for the aircraft, the suction and escape of non-combusted air out of the back, or the hot combusted air that is ejected out of the back of the engine?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope this question makes sense.</p>
","<p>I analyzed a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_F100"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 turbofan</a> last semester in my aerothermodynamics course, so allow me to answer this question. The short answer: <strong>the un-compressed air provides the majority of an engine's total thrust</strong> since the compressed air powers the engine.</p>

<p><strong>Correction</strong>: I forgot to mention that the fans also compress entering air. That is, all air entering an engine is compressed a bit by the fan. Some of this compressed air enters the turbojet core and the rest of the fan-compressed air bypasses the engine core. I ignored this for the sake of simplicity, but I should have explained this since you directly asked about air compression in a turbofan.</p>

<p>Long answer: see below!
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7wB2.png"" alt=""Turbofan diagram""></p>

<p><strong>1. The fan(s)</strong></p>

<p>Air enters the engine through a fan (or fans in the case of the F100 engine). These are the giant fans with a spinning insignia in the middle that you see inside an engine.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtPz1.jpg"" alt=""typical jet engine""></p>

<p>Update: The spinning insignia clearly show if the fan is spinning so workers don't get injured.</p>

<p>The fan(s) increases the pressure of the air that enters an engine. Some of this compressed air is diverted around the rest of the engine and is directed straight out of the engine. <strong>The bypass ratio is a measure of how much air bypasses the ""jet"" core</strong> (bypass air/core air).</p>

<p><strong>2. The compressors</strong></p>

<p>The rest of this air is then compressed through a combination of more fans and a converging duct. The data from my thermo project tells me that this stage increases the pressure of the core air by more than 10,000%, but I'm not too sure about that*. Sufficed to say, <strong>this core air now has a lot of energy</strong>--let's add some more :D</p>

<p>Quick note: The compressed air now has insignificant velocity <em>relative to the bypass air</em>. Most of the compressed air's energy is ""in"" its pressure (senior SE members, please correct me if I'm wrong).</p>

<p><strong>3. The combustion chamber</strong> (aka, combustor aka magic chamber)</p>

<p>Now the core air enters the combustion chamber. Here the air enters small chambers, mixes with jet fuel, and is ignited. The main parts-of-an-engine diagram I posted makes it seam like the combustion chamber is one big part of a jet-engine, but really the combustor consists of a bunch of smaller chambers surrounded the main shaft of the engine. Here is a gif that shows what I mean:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttgnh.gif"" alt=""combustion gif""></p>

<p>How the combustion chamber operates is beyond my scope of understanding, but consider that a combustor is essentially trying to keep a candle alight in the middle of a hurricane. Awesome engineering goes into designing better and more efficient (hotter-burning) chambers.</p>

<p><strong>4. The turbine</strong> (aka more magic section)</p>

<p>Now that hot and even more energetic air enters a the turbine section which consists of a diverging (increasing in area) duct and more fans. Whereas the compress ""inserted"" energy into the air, the turbines draw out energy from the air. As the air enters the larger (in volume) turbine area, it expands and spins the turbine fans <strong>which power the compressors and the fan</strong>. This Back Work Ratio (BWR) is a measure of how much turbine power it takes to spin the compressors. </p>

<p><strong>5. The nozzle</strong></p>

<p>The still energetic core air is once again concentrated before being shot out of the back of the engine.This thrust, together with the thrust of the bypass air, propels the air forward following this model:</p>

<p>$F_{thrust} = \dot{m}_{bypass} \times \Delta v_{bypass} + \dot{m}_{core} \times \Delta v_{core}$</p>

<p>Where $\dot{m}_{bypass}$ is the mass flow-rate of air that is bypassed and $\Delta v_{bypass}$ is the change in velocity of that air as a result of the fan.</p>

<p>And $\dot{m}_{core}$ is the mass flow-rate of air that is combusted and $\Delta v_{core}$ is the change in velocity of the core air as a result of the fan, compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine.</p>

<p><strong>The uncompressed air contributes about 60% of the total thrust.</strong> The ""processed"" air loses a significant portion of its energy to powering the engine. However, <em>the compressed air still provides about 40% of the total thrust</em>. Adding an afterburner can increase this contribution to 50%. How is this possible? Dead algae from a billion years ago.</p>

<p>The hydrocarbons in jet fuel pack a lot of energy into a small <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density"" rel=""noreferrer"">space</a> <em>and</em> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy"" rel=""noreferrer"">mass</a> (two completely different concepts). Burning those hydrocarbons releases a lot of energy that powers the fan, compressors, and electric generators of an aircraft before pushing the airplane forward. This high energy in a small place/space is also why electric cars/anything weren't practical until LiPo batteries (story for another article). </p>

<p>I applaud you for noticing that the uncompressed air contributes to an engine's thrust. I think the term ""bypass"" confuses some people into thinking that this air is ""thrown away"". it's not. The bypassed air is actually sped up by a series of fans and imparts forward momentum to the aircraft.</p>

<p>I'm studying Aerospace engineering right now (Whoop!), so my excitement at being able to answer this question rather side-tracked me from your original question, but I hope you enjoy the extra info on how a turbofan operates.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>

<p>The hotter a combustion chamber burns, the hotter the core air gets and the more energy it can provide for engine operation. Furthermore, hotter chambers waste less jet fuel and result in relatively cleaner and safer fumes. Increasing CC max temps and designing the rest of the engine (i.e., the turbine blades) to handle the increase in temp is the cutting edge of engine research. This is one of the most challenging and lucrative materials science/engineering problems in the world since efficiency is paramount in today and tomorrow's aviation industry.</p>

"Do flight recorders float in water?","12049","","<p>In a <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26513506"">recent BBC article</a> regarding the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 (MH-370), the writer refers to a US Naval officer's statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Commander William Marks from the US Seventh Fleet, which is taking part in the search, says he expects the plane's flight recorders to be floating in the water.</p>
  
  <p>""In calm seas, if there were a soccer ball [football] or a basketball floating in the water, the radar could pick it up. They [flight recorders] typically have a radio beacon and so for example our P3 [radar] - if they are flying within a certain range of that - will pick up that radio beacon. We have not yet picked up anything, but that's typically what those black boxes contain.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was under the (potentially incorrect) impression that flight recorders, by nature of the materials needed to protect their contents in the event of a crash, are quite dense and unable to float in water. I base this impression on news reporting of other airliner crashes (such as Air France 447, which crashed in the Atlantic), where the recorders were found some time later on the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Additionally, it seems reasonable to me that one would want to have the recorders <em>not</em> float so that they would come to rest near the other debris on the ocean floor since the recorders are equipped with underwater locator beacons which would aid in locating not only the recorders themselves but also the debris of the plane. If the recorders floated then they could move significant distances from the crash site and other debris, complicating search efforts.</p>

<p>It seems that Commander Marks, the writer of the article, or I (or some combination thereof) misunderstand something about flight recorders and their behavior in water.</p>

<p>My questions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do flight recorders float on water? If so, why?</li>
<li>I know that flight recorders are equipped with underwater locator beacons. Are they also equipped with radio beacons (either an active transmitter or a some passive device like a corner reflector to make them easier to detect with radar)?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The article has been updated, with the section regarding floating data recorders now reading:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Commander William Marks from the US Seventh Fleet, which is taking part in the search, said he expected the plane's flight recorders to be floating in the water.</p>
  
  <p>He said the recorders, also known as ""black boxes"", are fitted with radio beacons that can be picked up by radar.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>You are correct in the assumption that the typical data recorders being used today are too heavy to float.   They are designed to withstand <strong>very</strong> high forces, extreme temperatures, and to withstand corrosive environments (like sea water) for long periods of time. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.avbuyer.com/articles/detail.asp?Id=1858"">For example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A DFDR must obviously have a high degree of ‘crashworthiness.’ The
  first units were required to withstand a momentary shock force of
  1,000gs, the latest test standards now call for a test to 3,400gs for
  a duration of 6.5 milliseconds. The units also have to withstand a
  static crushing force at all of its six axis points of an applied load
  force of 5,000lbs for 5 minutes on each axis. Third, it must withstand
  a 500lbs piercing force test conducted by dropping it onto a ¼ inch
  steel pin from 10 feet. Lastly it must withstand a 1,100°C fire test
  for 60 minutes, and a 260°C oven test for 10 hours. </p>
  
  <p>It is also required that these units are mounted within the tail area
  of an aircraft, away from the potential crushing force of any engines
  mounted nearby. The DFDR must be watertight to a depth of 20,000 feet
  in sea water, and survive at this depth for 30 days - and it must be
  fitted with an underwater locator beacon which will act like a sonar
  transmitter, by ‘pinging’ a signal through the medium of water that it
  might be laying in.</p>

<p>Without seeing the original interview, I suspect that the author of the article got confused during the interview and was told that radar could detect debris the size of a soccer ball that is floating in the water and at a different time mentioned that they would be looking for the radio signals emitted by the black box (which wouldn't even be detected by radar).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>That being said, there <strong>are</strong> black boxes that can float and even eject from the airplane when a crash is detected.  They seem to be more common in military aircraft, and there have been a few attempts to require them in the US (and even have the government pay the $60,000/airplane price) but the bills stalled in congress.  The lawmakers here have recently started discussing this again though.</p>

<p><em>Deployable Black Boxes</em> have been around since the 60's and are a second set of black boxes meant to be a backup to the main ones.  They can be particularly useful when crashing into water or in the event of a major fire because they would not be within the main crash site.</p>

  <p>If you increase the chord, lift goes up almost linearly and stability
  decreases, because now the wing's lift force has a longer lever arm in
  flow direction. By increasing chord, you decrease aspect ratio...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few things I am not understanding, but I think they probably relate quite heavily, so I'm going to ask them together.</p>

<p>Firstly, what is the aspect ratio of the wing?  Is that a reference to the incidence of the wing and how a longer wing would mean a larger percentage of the side of the fuselage is covered by the wing (as seen from the front)?  Or am I way off the mark?</p>

<p>Secondly, why does increasing the chord length decrease the stability of the wing? In my mind a longer wing would mean that the craft is more stable because the airflow is being forced into line for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>Lastly, this all relates to how chord length is considered during wing design.  Are there other factors centered on the chord length that should be considered when designing a wing?  And do those factors change depending on the mission of the craft in consideration (eg., trainer v. cargo plane v. jumbo v. Mach 3 spy plane, etc.)?</p>
","<p>During design, chord length will be the result of wing span and wing area, because those two are what the designer wants to set. To be more precise, he tries to set a certain wing loading, trying to minimize wing area (and weight) such that the wing creates just enough lift for the estimated aircraft mass in all design cases. Take-off, maximum altitude and minimum turn radius are the classics which drive minimum wing area.<P></p>

<p>Now I will focus on aspect ratio, because Jan has already answered the rest with his excellent answer. The higher the aspect ratio, the less the wing tips will influence the airflow around the wing. This means that the wing creates more lift for a given angle of attack, but also that the stall angle of attack is lower. The ratio of wing span to aircraft mass (called span loading) is the driving force for induced drag. However, wing span and aspect ratio will also drive wing structural mass, so you need to find a sound compromise between low induced drag and low wing mass.</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8556/is-a-winglet-better-than-an-equal-span-extension/8579#8579"">What is induced drag?</a> It is the consequence of creating lift over a limited span. The wing creates lift by deflecting air downwards. This happens gradually over the wing's chord, and creates a reaction force orthogonally to the local speed of air. This means the reaction force is pointing up- and slightly backwards. This backwards component is induced drag! The wider the wing is, the more air can be used for lift creation, hence less deflection is needed. Consequently, the backwards tilt of the reaction force is smaller, resulting in less induced drag for the same lift.</p>

<p>If you fly fast, there is a lot of air mass streaming past the wing per unit of time, so you need to deflect the air only slightly. Your induced drag is small. That is why induced drag changes inversely with air speed.</p>

<p>Now you know that for high speed at high density, induced drag is not important. If you design an attack aircraft which has to fly at low altitude, a low aspect ratio will help: The lift increase due to gusts is smaller than with a high aspect ratio wing, and the induced drag is manageable.</p>

<p>How the lift curve slope changes with aspect ratio in subsonic flow is shown in the simple plot below. For a slender body (aspect ratio $\approx$ 0), the gradient of the lift coefficient $c_L$ over angle of attack $\alpha$ is $c_{L\alpha} = \frac{\pi \cdot AR}{2}$. Please note that the red line is only valid for AR = 0! Then the lift curve slope increases up to $c_{L\alpha} = 2\cdot\pi$  for $AR = \infty$ (and zero airfoil thickness and no friction effect), as shown by the blue line.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KRknE.png"" alt=""lift curve slope over AR""></p>

<p>There are more influences, however. Dihedral means that the lift is tilted inwards, and the part which counteracts weight is only growing with the cosine of the dihedral angle $\nu$. Same goes for sweep: Sweeping means that the wing only sees a reduced angle of attack change. If you want to capture all effects, a plot will not suffice. Here is a table with formulas for most cases:

<p>Nomenclature:<br>
    $c_{L\alpha} \:\:$ lift coefficient gradient over angle of attack<br>

    $(\frac{x}{l})_{d\:max} \:$  chordwise position of maximum airfoil thickness<br>
    $Ma \:\:$  Mach number<br>
<P>
Another consideration is wing volume: In most aircraft, the wing will hold most of the fuel, and a long-range aircraft needs big tanks. Sometimes, only choosing a lower aspect ratio will give enough wing volume for the required range. In order to keep induced drag constant, the span will be kept the same, so wing area increases with chord length. This has the added benefit of more lift, so less complex high-lift devices are needed. Since the structural mass of such a low aspect ratio wing with simple flaps is relatively low, the only disadvantage is the higher friction drag of this larger wing.
<P>
If maneuverability is important, wing span needs to be as small as possible. This reduces inertial moments and roll damping, so the aircraft can accelerate faster into a rolling motion and will reach a higher roll rate. This is extremely important in dogfights when the one who points his radar, gun and rockets at the adversary first will win. Here the chord is chosen for sufficient wing area at the minimum practical wing span.
<P>
Now we need to talk about viscous effects. Friction between air molecules and between air and wing. The ratio of inertial to viscous forces is expressed by the Reynolds number, and generally a higher Reynolds number means your friction effects go down, translating into less friction drag and a higher stall angle of attack. Especially for model airplanes, but also for gliders, it is sometimes better to reduce aspect ratio in order to gain absolute wing chord. The Reynolds number increases linearly with wing chord, and this can also be a consideration for choosing wing chord.
<P>
A normal wing has positive camber, and this means that the center of pressure moves forward with increasing angle of attack. Moment-wise, this means that the wing will create a stronger pitch-up moment when it pitches up. This makes the wing by itself unstable, and you need a tail surface to regain stability. Making wing chord longer will increase the unstable influence of the wing relative to the unchanged tail surface. This is why I said that increasing chord will decrease stability. During design, you watch for a size called tail volume. This is the area of the horizontal tail surface, multiplied with it's lever arm expressed as a multiple of the wing's reference chord. If you keep this constant while changing wing chord, your stability stays the same. But then you change your pitch damping, because this is affected by the square of the lever arm. Digging deeper will uncover more consequences, so I better stop here for today.</p>

"Why are propeller airplanes still made?","11958","","<p>Airplanes with propellers were invented a long time ago. After that, jet engines came into existence. My question is: why do we still have propeller engines?</p>

<p>The reasons I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are cheaper;</li>
<li>They cannot achieve very high speed;</li>
<li>They are not very noisy (though not always).</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides these, are there any other reasons general aviation airplanes built nowadays don't have jet engines?</p>
","<p>Jet engines are only efficient at high altitudes and high speed (25,000+ feet or so and 300+ knots or so true airspeed).  The cost of making and operating an airplane capable of flying there is very high, and most general aviation flights have no need of such performance (or expense) hence, propeller airplanes.</p>

<p>Reciprocating engine propeller airplanes are relatively efficient at low altitudes and airspeeds, they are more economical for the average types of general aviation flights.  They are also much cheaper to build and operate than a turbine powered airplane.</p>

<p>Turboprops fill the efficiency gap between reciprocating and pure jet engines, being most efficient at mid altitudes and airspeeds.  Still more expense and performance than most general aviation flights need though.</p>

"How do blimps control altitude?","11897","","<p>If you have an airship filled with helium, how can you adjust your altitude?  i.e. how do you ""go up"" or ""go down""?</p>

<p>Even staying still would be a challenge: The way I see it, you'll never have exactly the same average density as air and therefore will always be either slightly falling or slightly rising.</p>

<p>Is it the case that they have an extra tank of compressed gas as well as vents on the blimp and they make adjustmenst by increasing/decreasing internal pressure of the balloon?</p>
","<p>An airship pilot has three ways of adjusting lift:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every lighter-than-air vehicle needs some ballast to adjust its weight. This could be sand, but mostly water is used.</p></li>
<li><p>A blimp is only partially filled with helium. The envelope is held taut by filling a bag inside with air, called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballonet"" rel=""noreferrer"">ballonet</a>. If you press a little more air in this bag, the overall density of the gasses in the envelope goes up, while the volume stays practically constant. This allows for fine adjustment. Forward and aft ballonets even allow for trimming the pitch attitude.</p></li>
<li><p>When the airship moves, the air does provide a little dynamic lift or downforce, depending on pitch attitude and elevator deflection. This is a little tricky, because airships are not stable, and a pitch-up command will lead to altitude loss below a critical speed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UuUy7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The ballonets in this cutaway drawing of a Goodyear blimp are numbered 2 and 4. </p>

<p>On a calm day, the biggest disturbance is actually the sun. If the envelope is exposed to direct sunlight, it will heat up and the gas within will be heated as well, causing the blimp to rise. If the sun is covered by a cloud, the gas cools down and loses some lift. On partially cloudy days it is not easy to keep the same altitude!</p>

<p>Another threat is an unstable atmospheric temperature gradient. Glider pilots love this, because it will give them strong thermals, but the gas inside the airship will behave similarly to that bubble of warmer gas which causes thermals. When the airship rises, the gas inside cools less quickly than the surrounding air, and the airship will gain lift when it goes up. It becomes really bad on the way down: Now the gas warms up less quickly as well, and the airship loses lift as it comes down. The airship pilot needs to drop some ballast or create more dynamic lift, or his craft will slam into the ground.</p>

<p>Long-range airships like the LZ-127 used a mixture of hydrocarbon gases as fuel. This mixture (called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blau_gas"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blaugas</a>) was balanced to be just as heavy as air and filled some of the gas cells within the envelope. Consumed fuel would be displaced by air, so no lift adjustment was needed on a long trip.</p>

"How do Throttle control and Propeller control work together?","11860","","<p>I haven't been able to understand. </p>

<p>If propeller control controls the pitch of the blades in a constant speed engine, what do the throttle control do?</p>

<p>I've seen (in some normal operation manuals for some planes) that you have a Torque limit and control the Torque with the throttle control, and the RPM with the Propeller Control, but, if the propeller is spinning always at the same speed and the blades are positioned at the same pitch how can the throttle reduce or increase thrust? </p>
","<p>In a constant speed prop, the prop control lever basically changes the speed of the prop (it is not always running at the same speed as you indicate in your question, but rather once the speed is <strong>changed</strong> by the prop control lever, the governor keeps it at that speed). If power (or airspeed) is changed, the blade angle will automatically change in order to keep the prop turning at the same speed (within the limits that it is designed for).  </p>

<p>Since adding power would normally increase the speed of the prop, the governor automatically changes the blade angle in order to keep it at the same speed.  The same is true when power is reduced or airspeed is changed.</p>

<p>Thrust is changed by engine power because, even though the prop is turning at the same speed, the angle of attack of the prop has been changed, which changes the amount of thrust.</p>

"What is a high speed stall?","11844","","<p>I'm told that planes can actually stall when the airflow over the wing goes past Mach 1?  Why does this happen and how do you design an aircraft to avoid it?</p>
","<p>When the velocity of the airflow locally exceeds speed of sound above the wing a shock wave forms and the flow detaches beyond this shock wave.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_tuck#mediaviewer/File:Transonic_flow_patterns.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Transonic_flow_patterns.svg"" alt=""supersonic flow separation""></a></p>

<p>Similarly to stall, the supersonic separation of flow removes the component of lift produced by decrease of pressure on the upper surface of the wing and so the effects are similar.</p>

<p>I causes reduction of lift and because centre of pressure is about quarter chord on the upper surface, but midchord on the lower, it causes a significant pitch-down moment, which might be impossible to recover even if the post-stall lift is otherwise sufficient to keep the aircraft flying straight. This effect is often called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_tuck"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mach tuck</a>. Supersonic planes often have all-moving elevators to have sufficient control authority to compensate for it.</p>

<p>A difference from normal stall is that after supersonic flow separation the lift remains proportional to angle of attack and so the aircraft continues to behave more or less normally except for the change in trim.</p>

<p>Mach tuck may occur as low as Mach 0.7 depending on aircraft design, because the air moves faster over the wing. It can be delayed by using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swept_wing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">swept wings</a>, because the shock waves only form when the air velocity component perpendicular to the wing exceeds speed of sound.</p>

<p>Supersonic aircraft eventually encounter supersonic flow separation, but the lower surface lift is sufficient to balance the aircraft weight at that speed and altitude and the aircraft can continue flying with the upper surface flow separated.</p>

<p>That's not the case with most subsonic aircraft, which for efficiency reasons tend to cruise at altitudes where they have very small margin to stall. As the stall speed increases with altitude while speed of sound slightly decreases with the lower temperature there, the stall speed will eventually equal critical mach number, which creates the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_corner_(aviation)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coffin corner</a> and absolute ceiling for the aircraft. For most civilian transport aircraft the range between stall speed and critical mach number (where drag increases and supersonic flow separation would begin) reduces considerably at cruise altitude, but they usually don't have enough engine power to reach the actual coffin corner.</p>

"How much thrust is needed by an aircraft to have vertical takeoff?","11811","","<p>In some airshows, I have seen some big aircraft (like 737) takeoff almost vertical.</p>

<p>Generally, fully-loaded passenger/cargo planes don't do that, I guess due to safety issues but I think there needs a lot of extra thrust to have an almost vertical takeoff.</p>

<p>So is a vertical takeoff possible in every kind of airplane (without excessive weight and giving full thrust) or only some specific ones can do it?</p>
","<p>First, let's agree on terminology: What you saw in airshows is a vertical flight path. Flying horizontally first, the airplane pitched up until the nose was pointing straight into the sky.  </p>

<p>Surprisingly, no thrust is needed to perform this maneuver. Even gliders can do it. What happens is that kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, the rate of potential energy increase being proportional to flight speed and aircraft mass. If you start fast enough, this vertical flying can be maintained for several seconds, until the aircraft runs out of speed and stops in midair, followed by an uncontrolled drop. Skilled pilots orient the aircraft in the right direction by starting a rotation around the vertical axis at the top of the climb, so the following drop lets them pick up speed again with the correct nose-down attitude. Now potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy until speed is sufficient for a pullout. In aerobatics, this maneuver is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_turn"">a stall turn or a hammerhead stall.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few conditions apply, however. The airplane must be able to fly fast enough to have the needed potential energy to sustain the maneuver through the pitch-up phase. This is helped if its engines add energy, so the kinetic energy bleeds off more slowly. Also, at the top of the maneuver it is flying at zero g, and this requires at least that all items on board are securely fastened. Lastly, the pitch-up needs a load factor bigger than 1 g, and the higher the maximum load factor is, the tighter this pitch-up can be flown.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now the question has been changed: The vertical flight path is flown right after take-off. This limits the entry speed for the maneuver, and gliders will not be able to do this. If we take the 737 from the question and fly it with no payload and little fuel, the flight mass $m$ of a 737-700 is 40&nbsp;tons, and the installed thrust is about 200&nbsp;kN (sea level static). Let's assume that the pilot accelerates after takeoff to a horizontal speed $v$ = 100&nbsp;m/s (194&nbsp;KTAS) while retracting the flaps, the kinetic energy ($0.5\cdot m\cdot v^2$) is equivalent to a potential energy ($m \cdot g \cdot h$) of an altitude gain h of $$h = \frac{v^2}{2\cdot g} = 510 m$$
The engines deliver less thrust with increasing speed; maybe 40% of the weight, so the airplane will still accelerate for the first 18° - 20° of the 90° flight path change. This will delay the point when speed has been bled off and add maybe 150&nbsp;m to h. At 100&nbsp;m/s a pull-up with a radius of 500&nbsp;m will add a load factor of 2&nbsp;g. The pilot needs to pull less first and harder at the end of the maneuver in order to stay within the <a href=""http://home.scarlet.be/ppleducation/Limitations%20737.pdf"">maximum load factor of 2.5</a>. When speed bleeds off, so will wing lift, and in the second half of the pull-up the wing will not create enough lift to change the flight path enough in order to reach the desired vertical attitude. Also, the aircraft will be very low for a safe recovery.</p>

<p>This makes it rather doubtful that an airliner can be pulled up to a vertical climb after takeoff. If the maneuver is started at a higher speed and with a little more distance from the ground, I see no reason why it should not safely be possible.</p>

<p>Why is it that exceeding the speed of sound is acceptable in one situation but not the other?</p>
","<h2>Short answer:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Turbofans need supersonic speed at the fan blade tips to create their high thrust.</li>
<li>Turbofans can tolerate supersonic speeds because the intake creates constant flow conditions irrespective of flight speed.</li>
<li>Efficiency for propellers and fan blades is highest at subsonic flow conditions.</li>
<li>Propellers can turn at supersonic speeds, but since flow conditions are less controlled, the penalty for doing so is much higher than the penalty for a fan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>It is a bad thing to have supersonic fan blade tips, just like supersonic propeller tips are best avoided. But in turbofans it is a price worth paying, because the faster tip velocity means higher dynamic pressure, and the pressure difference between both sides of the fan blade grows with the square of their velocity. This makes the high thrust levels of modern turbofans possible.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpaZ1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpaZ1.png"" alt=""Propeller efficiency over speed""></a></p>

<p>Propeller efficiency over speed (picture <a href=""http://www.enginehistory.org/Allison/XF-84Propulsion.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>). The plot for fan blades would look not much different. The very thin, uncambered airfoil of a supersonic propeller and the added wave drag lower the maximum efficiency, but hold efficiency up into supersonic air speeds.</p>

<p>Note that the propeller on the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21683/did-the-xf-84h-thunderscreech-really-cause-900-sonic-booms-per-minute/21700?s=1%7C0.1966#21700"">XF-84H Thunderscreech</a> did move at supersonic speed. There is nothing inherent in propellers which prevents their tips from moving faster than the speed of sound. On the other hand, the big diameter of a prop requires proportionally more torque to keep the prop rotating against the drag from the supersonic tips. Thus, a fan engine requires less torque per blade to reach supersonic tip speeds on the fan blades.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11884/do-nacelles-around-aircraft-engines-help-in-reducing-the-engine-sound/11891#11891"">shroud of a turbofan engine helps a lot</a> to make the noise from supersonic tips manageable. The XF-84H's noise made people literally sick. But there is more to it: @FreeMan encouraged me with his comment to dive a little deeper.</p>

<p>A supersonic propeller will work well when the direction of flow at every station along the propeller blade is about equal to the local airfoil chord. Since the blade is uncambered, this means that the change in local flow direction at the leading edge can be minimized to the amount which is required to create the desired thrust. But to be able to fulfill this condition you need to match your propeller speed to the flight speed <strong>and</strong> twist distribution. Also, the angle of attack must be compensated for by sviveling this propeller axis into the direction of flight. It will have no <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/312/whats-p-factor-and-why-does-it-occur"">p-factor</a>, but can run at only one speed for a given flight speed.</p>

<p>Contrast this with a turbofan: The intake makes sure that the flow speed and direction at the face of the fan is the same no matter what the flight speed is. This is done by the pressure field in and around the intake which <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11723/why-do-engine-cowl-lips-appear-larger-and-more-blunt-on-the-sides-than-on-the-to/11730#11730"">will spill excess air overboard at high speed or suck extra air</a> in from the sides at low speed. In the fan you can indeed match the local angle of incidence to the airspeed so the fan will work well over its design range.</p>

<p>Generally, a fully subsonic fan would be more efficient. But then the diameter would need to be as large as that of big turboprop engines, and the shroud would become impossibly heavy and produce too much drag. The high dynamic pressure on the fan blades is needed to produce the thrust with the relatively small diameter of a turbofan.</p>

","<p>The <a href=""http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR1003.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NTSB report</a> is a great resource when looking for information about an incident like this.</p>

<p>There is an Engine Dual Failure Checklist discussed starting in section 1.17.1.2 of the report. This includes steps to attempt restarting the engines, and further steps depending on whether or not the engines can be started, and finally steps to help prepare for a forced landing. Pilots train on engine failures regularly, so they are already familiar with the procedures. The report discusses how their actions compared to what the checklists say. Since the incident occurred at such a low altitude right after takeoff, they didn't have time to complete all of the steps. They did what they had time for, and had to make quick decisions about what their options were.</p>

<p>The report also discusses in section 1.17.3.2 the ditching training the pilots received. There was guidance in the manual, but no specific scenarios included in their simulator training.</p>

<p>The autopilot is great for use in normal situations. However, as soon as anything is going wrong, the pilot should take control of the plane. You do not want to take time to figure out ""what's it doing now"" in a difficult situation. So in this situation, the autopilot probably disconnected when the engines went out, or was manually disconnected by the pilots.</p>

<p>Section 1.6.3 talks about the flight envelope protections. I believe these protections are what you are referring to when you say that the autopilot has more control. They are designed to protect the plane from stalling or otherwise exiting controlled flight. Because the pilot was able to start the APU to provide electrical power, the plane remained in the ""normal law"" mode where these protections were available. This limits the control the pilot has in order to protect the plane, in the sense that the plane will override pilot inputs to avoid dangerous situations.</p>

<p>Section 2.7.2 discusses the impact of these protections in this case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The airplane’s airspeed in the last 150 feet of the descent was low
  enough to activate the alpha-protection mode of the airplane’s
  fly-by-wire envelope protection features...</p>
  
  <p>Because of these features, the airplane could not reach the maximum
  AOA attainable in pitch normal law for the airplane weight and

<p>It shows your attitude (nose up / down, bank left / right) relative to a horizontal surface. Basically, it tells you the orientation of the plane if someone were to take a photo of the plane from the outside at this very moment.</p>

<p>It does not tell you which way you are going (e.g. you can be nose up but descending).</p>

<h2>Turn coordinator</h2>

<p>The white plane tells you which way you are yawing (rotation about the normal (vertical) axis)). If you are yawing to the right (e.g. N -> NE -> E), the right wing of the little plane is lower. If you are yawing to the left (e.g. N -> NW -> W), the left wing is lower.</p>

<p>If you are yawing at the <em>standard rate</em> (3 degrees per second), the wing of the little plane will align with the white mark.</p>

"Why doesn't the A380 use its outboard thrust reversers?","11604","","<p>One thing I noticed with the A380 is that it only seems to use the inboard thrust reversers while landing. I suspect it relates to FOD ingestion or perhaps damaging the runway. This is strange though, because the 747-8 (which also has a large wingspan and very large engines), <em>does</em> use all of its thrust reversers during landing.

<p>I've read that most airliners are allowed to take off even when all reverse-thrusters are inoperative. Most of the deceleration is handled by the brakes normally.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the Airbus A380 weighing in fully loaded at 1,265,000 pounds, you might think stopping it within a reasonable distance after landing would require a Phalanx of Heavy-duty thrust reversers.</p>
  
  <p>Truth be told, in the megaliner’s braking system, thrust reversers are the least critical components. Airliners are not required to have thrust reversers, and only the two inboard engines on the A380 are equipped with them. The decision not to install reversers on the A380’s two outboard engines saved weight and lowered the chances that those engines, which sometimes hang over runway edges, would be damaged by ingesting foreign objects.</p>
  
  <p>The two reversers do help slow the A380—but not by much. In fact, unlike the thrust reversers on most airliners, including the Boeing 747 jumbo, they do not stop the aircraft in a shorter distance than brakes and spoilers alone. They do, however, take some of the strain off the brakes and are useful if water or snow makes the runway slippery.</p>

"Why is mid-air refueling worth it? (or is it at all?)","11595","","<p>Surely, mid-air refueling is a cool thing, but is it worth it?</p>

<p>It's obvious that the military, for one, has some requirements to keep aircraft airborne so that they can keep patrolling, for example.</p>

<p>However, that is due to the need to keep the aircraft airborne and is not necessarily because the method is cost-effective.
Flying another aircraft carrying lots of fuel just doesn't seem very money/environment-friendly &ndash; you waste more fuel needed to power the fuel-carrying aircraft in addition to the fuel you would already need.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is mid-air refueling cost-effective under any circumstances? Or is it just an emergency practice?</li>
</ul>
","<p>In some contexts, the economics depends on how special the aircraft you're refueling is.</p>

<p>Consider  something like an AWACS mission. You have this very complex specialized aircraft, with a large, highly trained, crew <em>in addition to</em> the flight crew. If you <em>didn't</em> refuel that during the mission, it might need to spend a lot of its active hours being unproductive en route to and from the war. You would need <em>more of them</em> (and more crews) to reach any given level of in-theater coverage.</p>

<p>On the other hand <em>with</em> aerial refueling you need some tankers scuttling back and forth with fuel for your sentries. But they are cheaper and simpler to operate, cheaper and simpler to crew, and so forth. So even though you may use slightly more <em>aircraft hours</em> in total, the total  <em>costs</em> can be lower.</p>

<p>This doesn't hold to just the same extent for fighters and bombers, because they have to return to base from time to time to stock up on munitions anyway. There are still ""readyness"" types of missions it would be relevant for. The price tag for an F-35 seems to be in about the same ballpark as for a KC-767, but a KC-767 can service <em>many</em> F-35s in a single mission, so having the tankers do the scuttling-back-and-forth can still be an economic win.</p>

<p>Also, it's a good thing for a fighter that gets into combat <em>not</em> to be lugging around enough fuel to get all the way home by itself.</p>

"What happens if a language other than English is used over the radio?","11573","","<p>In many non-English speaking countries, communication with ATC may be conducted either in English or the native language. Famous examples are China, Russia, France and possibly Germany. </p>

<p>When a pilot who is a non-speaker of the native language hears such communication, which is he to do? Just sit back with no idea of what is going on?</p>
","<p>During the 1990s I flew into countries on every continent except Antarctica. As an American English speaker flying U.S. registered airplanes, I never had a complaint that a controller had trouble understanding me, and I was always addressed in English by the controllers. Sometimes, though, I would have trouble understanding the controller's accent and would have to ask them to repeat their instructions.</p>

<p>As you mentioned, in some countries the controllers will address the pilots of that country in their native language. Personally, I always felt that compromised the smooth functioning of the system to a degree, because it denied a good bit of the overall picture of what was happening to the pilots who didn't speak that language. For example, if two airplanes preceding you are being rerouted for some reason, but you can't understand what they've been given (and which you're probably going to be given), you're not as prepared for the reroute when it comes through to you in English.</p>

<p>Even if controllers spoke to you in English, they would typically pronounce place names and fixes as they are pronounced in the native language. My first flights in France were a real problem in this respect. The French controllers were speaking good and understandable English, but the French pronunciation of the place names did not match our English rendition of the names we were seeing (and had never seen or heard before) on the IFR maps (no glass cockpits back then for us). In a couple of instances, we had to request that they spell the names, which didn't make us popular. On one occasion, when we made such a request, another pilot came on frequency and said, ""He means ...."" and gave us an English transliteration if you will of what the controller was saying.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the worst time I ever had understanding a clearance was one from a nominally English speaking controller. We were talking to Scottish control, and received a reroute into Amsterdam from a controller with a very pronounced accent (Glaswegian?). All I was able to get was that at the end he was turning us over to Dutch control and the frequency. I went over to the Dutch, and asked for them to restate what our new clearance was, and I apologized, explaining that I had been unable to understand Scottish control. His first words were, ""That's okay, we can't understand them either.""</p>

"Why are turbine blades not made out of titanium, only compressor blades?","11564","","<p>According to <a href=""http://youtu.be/Hv-e8J8Sq48?t=2m16s"">this video on jet engine blades</a>, titanium is never used for the turbine, because it ""melts and burns at the temperature of the flame"". Only the blades of the compressor are made of this material.</p>

<p>However, the melting temperature of titanium is higher than that of any steel alloys I could find, and titanium produces a protective layer of oxides on the surface. What other properties of titanium make using it impossible?</p>
","<p>Titanium is unsuitable because it will react with oxygen and carbon at high temperature, well below its melting point, making it very hard and brittle. Welding titanium is very complicated because it needs to be shielded extremely well from any oxygen when hot. Ti$_3$O will form above 500°C, and Ti$_2$O above 600°C.</p>

<p>Initially turbine blades were made of steel alloys, but they have been displaced by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconel"" rel=""noreferrer"">nickel alloys</a>.</p>

<p>Also, they operate in an environment which requires constant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade#Methods_of_cooling"" rel=""noreferrer"">cooling</a>, so they can be 200 - 300°C cooler than the turbine entry temperature of the gas coming from the combustor(s). Modern turbine blades are hollow and have a perforation at their leading edge. Pressurized, relatively cool air is forced through the blades and the perforation and flows around the blade's surface, creating a cool sheet of air to shield the blade from the hot gas. Also, before entering the turbine the gas is accelerated, which already lowers its temperature. See the plot below of parameters inside an older engine taken from <a href=""http://www.cast-safety.org/pdf/3_engine_fundamentals.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> source.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLcXa.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Shortly past the fuel injectors the maximum gas temperature of approx. 1800°C is reached, which drops to 1100°C at the entry to the first turbine stage. Note that this temperature has been raised to 1500°C in modern military engines! At the same time, the highest temperature is connected with the lowest speed (30 m/s), and the flow accelerates to 200 m/s directly before entering the first turbine stage.</p>

<p>Titanium in contact with oxygen would lose a lot of its strength at these temperatures, even though its melting point is at 1650°C.</p>

<p>Bonus question: if they did fall out of the sky, I'm assuming it would be in lawn dart mode and not in flat spins?</p>

<p>Footnote 1: While the apocalypse event in Revolution turns out to not be an EMP, you can assume it was something similar for the purpose of this question.</p>
","<p>Older airliners use hydraulics and cables attached to the pilot controls. Some RATs power the hydraulics directly as well so limited control is still possible then. The pilots would get a workout but the plane would safely touch down.</p>

<p>However planes with entirely fly-by-wire systems (no current airliner is completely fly-by-wire) will be completely uncontrollable apart from shifting weight and would glide to the ground. They are made stable so they won't just enter a spin and pancake into the ground.</p>

"How does a Constant Speed Propeller work?","11535","","<p>My explanation of how a constant speed propeller works has always been a little shaky. I know about the ""speeder spring,"" ""counter-weights,"" and how it utilizes the engine oil pressure, but I'd love to know of a simple and easy-to-understand diagram and explanation that I can use to really understand it, and then teach it to others?</p>
","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/24hoB.jpg"" alt=""The pilot valve is resting directly on the flyweights.""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5ARz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Before we get started, I should mention that the most basic constant-speed propellers were driven by balancing air pressure and centrifugal force. The blades were shaped in such a way, or equipped with a counterweight that would cause the blade to intrinsically move to a shallow pitch. However, when air was moved over the blade, it would begin to overpower the counterweight and push the blade to a higher pitch. It's a pretty ingenious design that meant that the prop would automatically be at a high RPM when the plane was moving slowly (takeoff, landing, climbs),  and would automatically move to a higher pitch when the plane sped up for cruise. There is even a single-bladed propeller that utilized this design very efficiently for light aircraft. The problem is that this type of propeller is not pilot-adjustable, and I am assuming you are wondering about adjustable props, so that's what we'll talk about from here on.</p>

<p>In the first picture, observe that the pilot valve is resting directly on the flyweights (separated by a bearing). The second picture better depicts the valve system. So we see that the speeder spring is pushing down on the top of the pilot valve's shaft, which is in turn resting on the flyweights.</p>

<p>First off, the flyweights are turned by the crankshaft, so any change in engine RPM is immediately reacted to.</p>

<p>There are a few ways that the propeller is attached to the piston, and a rack and pinon type gear system is common and easy to imagine. The rack is fixed to the piston so that when it moves, the prop blade's pinion gear is rotated and thus the blade is rotated. Another common type uses a peg that is offset from the center of the blade's circular base. When the piston moves, it pushes or pulls on the peg and because the peg is offset it causes the blade to twist.</p>

<p>Overspeed: When your airspeed increases.</p>

<p>When the RPMs increase, the centrifugal force causes the flyweights to want to spread apart in order to conserve momentum. Because they're in an L shape and have a hinge in the corner, this causes the lower part to rise up, pulling the pilot valve up and compressing the speeder spring. When the pilot valve is raised, pressurized oil from the pump is allowed to flow into the prop hub through a tube that passes through the center of the hub piston. The oil fills a cavity in front of the piston, pushing it backwards. The prop blade is rotated to a higher pitch (closer to feather) which slows the engine RPM. When the RPM is reduced, the flyweights will be under less centrifugal force, and the speeder spring will push them back to equilibrium (on-speed), pushing the pilot valve back down to block the hub oil tube from gaining or losing oil.</p>

<p>Underspeed: When your airspeed decreases.</p>

<p>When the RPMs decrease, there is less centrifugal force acting on the flyweights. Due to their shape as described earlier, they are no longer able to push up on the speeder spring with the same force as before, so the compressed spring will begin to expand. This brings the top of the flyweights in, and their bottoms down. When their bottoms move down, the pilot valve moves down as well and unblocks the hub oil tube. Positive oil pressure in the hub and the blades' built-in tendency to want to move to a low pitch pushes the oil out of the hub and back into the oil system. The piston moves forward and the blades rotate to a low-pitch condition. The flyweights do not necessarily return to equilibrium, especially if you manually set the spring to maximum compression with the prop lever: you want the prop to stay at minimum pitch no matter what.</p>

<p>Loss of oil pressure:</p>

<p>Oil pressure is constantly pushing against the bottom of the pilot valve, trying to force it upwards. The speeder spring is resisting, and while the flyweights are on-speed, the whole system is in equilibrium with the valve blocking the hub tube. When you lose oil pressure, that pressure is no longer holding the valve up and the speeder spring will win, pushing the valve down and allowing the oil to flow out of the hub. This resets the prop to the low-pitch climb setting, giving us maximum power because that's more useful than maximum speed in the emergency situation that is probably about to occur.</p>

<p>So why do we do this?</p>

<p>All propellers are set at a pitch. Theoretically, a propeller is pitched to move forward a certain distance each revolution, just like a screw moving through wood. But unlike wood, air is fluid and difficult to grip. If you imagine screwing a screw into a board, the only way to make it go in faster is to turn it faster. This is because the screw's pitch is fixed. If you could space out the rungs on the screw (increase the pitch) the screw would move through the wood faster but it would become much harder to turn.</p>

<p>An airplane's propeller works much the same way. When we first take off, we need to impart maximum power into the air and it doesn't matter if we don't move forward very far for each revolution, because we're not going very fast anyway. We just want to move as much air as possible. But we will reach a certain point where the only way to speed to is to increase the number of prop revolutions, and that's impractical with our engines. The only alternative is to change the pitch of the blade. We change it to a pitch which allows us to move forward a greater distance with each revolution, in exchange for less power being imparted into the air each revolution. Luckily, we don't need to pump out so much energy, just enough to keep us from slowing down.</p>

<p>If you like numbers, imagine we have an engine and propeller that theoretically (at perfect efficiency) moves forward 1 foot for each revolution, and it can make 1 revolution per second, giving a maximum forward speed of 1 foot per second. That's perfectly fine when we're taking off: we might be moving forward at 0.5 fps, and we have some air being blown backwards a 0.5 fps. When when we level off at cruise, we're stuck at 1 fps. But we want to go 3 fps and we know our airframe can handle it. The easiest option is to turn the engine three times as fast, but unfortunately that would send some pistons flying out of the cowling. So we have to change the prop pitch to one that moves forward 3 feet for each revolution, that way it's still turning at the same rate, but it will move us forward three times as far. Or more likely we're still going 1 fps but only 1/3 RPM and burning 1/3 the fuel! It's here that you can see the issue: if we're burning 1/3 the fuel, we're only imparting 1/3 the energy into the air through the prop, and there's no way we could climb or accelerate quickly (if at all) at that setting.</p>

<p>A final way to think about it is just like the gears on a car. Your transmission allows you to, at 1500RPM, go 10mph or 60mph or any speed in between. The problem is that if you try to accelerate from 10mph to 60mph while maintaining 1500RPM, it will take a much longer time than if you were to bump it up to 2500RPM. High gears are great for cruising and <em>maintaining</em> speed, but are not great for accelerating. They allow you to keep your RPMs low, your torque low, and your fuel burn low, because you don't need that extra energy. A high prop pitch is exactly the same.</p>

<p>A note about multi-engine aircraft:</p>

<p>They are just the opposite of singles. Where singles require positive oil pressure to increase blade pitch, multis require positive pressure to decrease it. This is because in a multi, you want the propeller to feather automatically if you lose oil pressure (because of an engine failure). This removes a significant amount of drag from that side of the aircraft.</p>

<p>They are equipped with either a spring or a nitrogen charge in the hub that is pressurized, pushing the hub piston back to the feathered position. The prop governor works the same way but the pilot valve directs oil to push against the back of the piston, moving it forward and compressing the spring/nitrogen, moving the prop to a lower pitch.</p>

<p>Some are also equipped with an unfeathering accumulator. This is a bottle with a piton in the top (also charged with nitrogen) that fills up with oil when the engine is running. When you bring the prop out of high RPM, the bottle is sealed off from the rest of the system. If you lose oil pressure, the prop will feather like it's supposed to, but there will still be pressurized oil in the accumulator. That way if you manage to get your engine issues taken care of, you can push the prop lever full forward, open the valve to the accumulator, and the pressurized nitrogen will force the oil out of the bottle to put the whole system under positive pressure for a few seconds. This positive pressure moves the hub piston forward and unfeathers the prop.</p>

<p>Now you might think ""If multis feather when they lose oil pressure, why are all those twins out on the ramp sitting there with low-pitched props?"" Well, they have centrifugal locking pins that disappear when the engine RPM is high enough. If it gets low, they will fall back down into a groove around the hub piston or its shaft and lock it into a low-pitch state. This is not a fool-proof system, however, because the pins have been known to stick, and people have been known to shut the engine off with the prop lever less than full-forward. In that case you either need to get some strong guys out there to manually twist the prop back, or you need to waste a chunk of your starter's precious life turning the engine over to create oil pressure to unfeather the prop. Most engines can not start in a feathered state due to the huge drag from the blades being perpendicular to their direction of rotation.</p>

<p>On turboprops:</p>

<p>Although it can vary engine to engine, turboprops use similar systems to multi-engine aircraft but at much higher pressures and with the ability to enter beta mode (reverse pitch). That introduces problems mainly in that the engine will very quickly overspeed with the blade pitch is 0 and the prop is generating no thrust/load. I'm not going to attempt to explain it because I've never really worked with one. <a href=""http://www.aviationpros.com/article/10388997/propeller-control-for-turbo-prop-engines"">This guy seems to do a good job, though.</a></p>

  <p>Possible downgrade of the airman’s certificate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the airman <em>satisfactorily completes the reexamination</em> (5-1424(A)), then the inspector will issue a letter of results. If the certificate had been temporarily suspended, then the <code>FSDO forwards a copy of the letter of results to the Regional Assistant Chief Counsel, who then takes appropriate action to terminate the suspension. If the airman needs use of the certificate immediately, the Regional Assistant Chief Counsel may authorize the inspector to issue a temporary certificate that bears all ratings and limitations from the original certificate.</code> Otherwise, if the certificate had <em>not</em> been suspended, the airman is free <code>to exercise the privileges of the certificate and/or ratings.</code></p>

<p>If the airman does <em>not satisfactorily complete the reexamination</em> (5-1424(B)), then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The airman must be informed in detail of each deficiency. Additionally, if the airman’s certificate had been temporarily deposited at the FSDO and the temporary deposit term is nearing expiration, a decision must be made to suspend the certificate or to extend the temporary deposit period for another 30 days. If, in the opinion of the inspector, the airman could successfully complete another reexamination by obtaining additional instruction, every effort must be made to encourage the airman to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on what the inspector decides, one of two things happens:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) When the inspector decides to allow the airman additional time, the inspector takes the airman's certificate for temporary deposit at the FSDO and issues a temporary certificate. The temporary certificate must have a limitation against carrying passengers and a 30-day expiration date. The airman has 30 days in which to practice or obtain additional dual instruction before being reexamined again.</p>
  
  <p>2) If the inspector determines the airman is unable to establish qualification to hold the certificate or rating, legal enforcement action must be taken to revoke the airman’s certificate and/or ratings. (See FAA Order 2150.3, Chapter 8.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>When is the enforcement action issued?</strong></p>

<p>This is mostly covered in the above sections. Essentially, if you are not found deficient, a revocation of your suspension will begin to be processed or you can just proceed on your merry way. If you are found deficient, then you will either be immediately be issued a temporary certificate with limitations so you can practice to pass another re-exam, or your certificate will revoked as soon as can be legally done (presumably the inspector will tell you not to fly, but I don't have backing for that).</p>

<p><strong>What happens during a 709 ride?</strong> (<em>5-1423</em>)</p>

<p>Part (A) of 5-1423 deals with this, and states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Extent of Reexamination.</strong> The inspector should test the airman only in the areas specified in the letter of notification. However, if other deficient areas are noted during the reexamination, these would also be the basis for failure of the test. For example, during a reexamination when the airman was to be tested on the ability to recognize and recover from stalls, the inspector noted that on takeoff the airman over-rotated to a dangerously high pitch attitude, requiring the inspector to take corrective action. In this situation the reexamination should be discontinued, and the airman should be informed of failing the test because of deficient skills exhibited while en route to demonstrate the maneuvers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part (B) notes that the inspector can place special emphasis on certain areas based on the reason for the letter being issued. You can fail if you are unqualified for <em>any</em> maneuver contained in the PTS for the certificate/rating you are being tested for, as Part (C) notes.</p>

<p>Part (D) notes that the test does not have to be flight-based, though presumably one that <em>did</em> would have some portion of oral examination. (Part (E) allows the test to be taken in a simulator, if it is requested by the airman and approved by the inspector).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Knowledge Reexamination.</strong> The reexamination may be conducted using an oral or knowledge test, devised by the inspector, if the area to be reexamined is one of knowledge rather than skill or flight proficiency.</p>

<p>...it appears that there is a very noticeable left kink in the landing area of runway 32/33R.</p>

<p>According to what I can interpret from Jeppesen's airport data, there doesn't appear to be any indication of this kink: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DrV0d.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DrV0d.png"" alt=""Jeppesen airport diagram""></a><br>

<p><strong>Is that kink actually there</strong>, or is it an artifact of Google's processing of  different images? There is obviously something going on, as you can see both RWY32 &amp; RWY33 markings in the image, while Jeppesen clearly identifies it as 33.</p>

<p>If that kink is actually there, what impact does that have on a pilot landing? I believe the touchdown target is the two long, solid bars at the top left of the image, which excludes the kink, however, there is enough rubber to indicate that touchdowns have occurred much closer to the threshold than that.</p>
","<p>An interesting feature of your question is the apparent double-exposure of runway number in your image. And I suspect it will also account for/explain why you see a kink in an image.</p>

<p>Occasionally, runways change number. The reason for this is basically that runways only have 36 possible designations (1-36) however a runway designated 18 may be orientated anywhere from 175-184 degrees. Usually the actual orientation of the runway is rounded to the nearest 10. hence, a runway pointing at 184 degrees would be designated ""Runway 18"". </p>

<p>Magnetic variation drifts over the years (eg, 10 years ago Southern UK was +3 degrees, now it is +1). This may make a runway which was once 184 degrees magnetic now 186 degrees and that would require its designation to change from ""Runway 18"" to ""Runway 19"".</p>

<p>Now, as for your image, I would guess that Google have taken a grab when it was Runway 32, and (at least partially) again once it had been re-designated (and repainted!) Runway 33. This is backed up with the airport's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_Su%C3%A1rez_Madrid%E2%80%93Barajas_Airport"">wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 20 September 2012, both runways 15/33 were renamed as 14R/32L (the longest) and 14L/32R (the shortest).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The act of stitching images together, and the image processing algorithms in use, mean you get kind of a partial of one image and partial of the other. It is almost certainly not there in real life, and thus has no effect on the pilot's handling around that runway.</p>

"How to do Weight & Balance for Cessna 172?","11387","","<p>What is the best method to do Weight &amp; Balance for a Cessna 172? (If it's possible with a small tutorial!)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_gravity_of_an_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">Calculation section of “Center of gravity of an aircraft”</a> on Wikipedia gives an overview of the steps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Determine the weights and arms of all mass within the aircraft.</li>
  <li>Multiply weights by arms for all mass to calculate moments.</li>
  <li>Add the moments of all mass together.</li>
  <li>Divide the total moment by the total weight of the aircraft to give an overall arm.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The Basic Empty Weight (BEW) of the aircraft will come from the Weight &amp; Balance information that is unique to each aircraft. The computed arm for the BEW may have some rounding error, so treat it as informational. Use the precise figures for Weight and Moment from your aircraft’s W&amp;B.</p>

<p>The arms, distances from some reference datum, will also come from your aircraft’s W&amp;B info: fuel, front seats, rear seats, and baggage areas on a Cessna 172. Copy those into your table as well.</p>

<p>Avgas (100LL) weighs 6 pounds per gallon, so the weight is 6 times the number of gallons.</p>

<p>I like to work top-to-bottom and left to right. For the grand finale, divide the sum of the Moment column by the sum of the Weight column to get the overall center of gravity.</p>

<p>The example below is from my PP-ASEL checkride taken in a Cessna 172. The items in <strong>boldface</strong> are computed values. The digits after the decimal are there for typographical purposes and do not necessarily indicate significant figures.</p>

Before reading this, I thought taxi lights and landing lights were the same, which seems to be true is some cases. I thought those lights were used for approach, taxiing, and take off and were strong lights designed to light the floor in front of the aircraft in the darkest night. Moreover, the answer linked above speaks of exterior lighting. </p>

<p>Now, I got a serie of questions to clarify the role of those ""exterior lighting"":</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the difference between them (landing lights, taxi lights, other exterior lights I never heard of)? </li>
<li>What purpose do they serve and when are they used? (Perhaps it is the same question)</li>
<li>Are all aircrafts equipped with?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There are basically two types of (exterior) lights in an aircraft- the navigational lights, which are required to be switched on from sunset until sunrise and other forms of exterior lights, which can be switched off at the pilot or operated only at some parts of the aircraft operation, like the landing/taxi lights. </p>

<p>A (non-exhaustive) <a href=""http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0263.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of aircraft lights</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Navigation lights</strong> All aircraft are equipped with a steady light near the leading edge of each wingtip. The starboard light is green while that on the port wing is red. The different colors make it possible for an outside observer, such as the pilot of another aircraft, to determine which direction the plane is flying. These are required to be on during operation (in night).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navigation or Position lights</strong> In addition to the red and green lights, most large planes like airliners are also fitted with other steady white navigation lights in various locations like the trailing edges of each wingtip, horizontal tail and top of the vertical tail. The main purpose is to increase the visibility of aircraft from behind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anti-Collision Beacon lights</strong> These are are flashing (or strobe) light assemblies installed on the upper and lower fuselage of aircraft,used to improve visibility of the aircraft. These can be switched off at the discretion of the pilot under some conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strobe lights</strong> High-intensity strobe lights that flash a white-colored light are located on each wingtip. These flashing lights are very bright and intended to attract attention during flight. They are sometimes also used on the runway and during taxi to make the plane more conspicuous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logo lights</strong> These steady white lights on the surface of or at the tips of the horizontal stabilizer are used to illuminate the company's logo painted on the vertical tail. These are usually switched off in airports to improve the visibility of the aircraft.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wing lights</strong> Many airliners feature lights along the root of the wing leading edge that can be used to illuminate the wing and engine pylons in flight. These lights may be used to make the plane more visible during takeoff and landing or to inspect the wings for damage in flight. Pilots can also use the wing lights to inspect the wings and slats for any ice accretion that might build up when flying through clouds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Taxi lights</strong> A bright white lamp is located on the nose landing gear strut of most planes. This light is typically turned on whenever the aircraft is in motion on the ground for greater visibility during taxi, takeoff, and landing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Landing lights</strong> Typically the brightest light in the aircraft, these are fitted on most planes (and helicopters) for enhanced visibility during the landing approach. These lights can also be used to illuminate the runway at poorly lit airports. They can be located in the wing root, in the outboard wing, or somewhere along the forward fuselage (the usual location incase of helicopters), with some aircraft having them in more than one location.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Runway Turnoff lights</strong> Usually located in the leading edge of the wing root, these bright white lamps are intended to provide side and forward lighting during taxi and when turning off the runway. These lights are most useful at poorly lit airports but are usually unnecessary. The lights can also be used in flight if greater visibility is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wheel Well lights</strong> Some planes are equipped with additional lights in the nose and main gear wheel wells. These lights are provided primarily to assist ground personnel in making pre-flight inspections of a plane at night. </p></li>

"For large jets, what is the primary means of slowing down after landing?","11371","","<p>I understand that a large(r) commercial jet slows down after landing using the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wheel brakes</li>
<li>Reverse thrust</li>
<li>Spoilers/flaps/airbrakes</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the effectiveness of each compared to the others? What if one of the first 2 fails? Can an airliner usually be stopped without using wheel brakes or without using reverse thrust?</p>

<p>And what if the runway is slick because of rain, snow or ice? Does that change the equation?</p>
","<p>The brakes are much more effective than anything else, at least for the jet I have experience in (EMB-145).  </p>

<p>Our landing performance data typically assumes full braking application, spoilers deployed and no reverse thrust.  The airplane will most certainly stop without using reverse thrust, just not as fast.  I never tried not using the brakes, and if I were to I would want a light airplane and a very long runway.</p>

<p>As Lnafziger pointed out in the comments, the brakes are part of redundant systems so that they are always available.  In the EMB-145, the brakes were serviced by two independent* hydraulic systems. The inboard brakes were on one system while the outboards were on the other for a total of 4 wheels each with big carbon fiber brakes.</p>

<p>To address the comments on slick runways, assuming braking action allows an attempt to land in the first place, you have to be careful. With reverse thrust alone you may not be able to maintain the runway centerline and directional control may become difficult through uneven deployment of the reversers and other factors.  In this scenario the spoilers are helpful to increase traction and brake effectiveness.  In short, if the runway is slick then the only way I'm attempting a no wheel brake landing is after I delcare an emergency.</p>

<p>Finally, to address the question in the title, the wheel brakes are always the primary means of slowing the airplane.</p>

"How do pilots decide what their cruising altitude will be?","11355","","<p>When filing a flight-plan for a long-haul high-altitude IFR flight, how do pilots select a specific cruising altitude? Typically in the range of 25,000 - 35,000 ft.</p>
","<p>As has been stated, ATC will assign you an altitude, taking into account your requested altitude, traffic conditions, and of course the FAR.</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/3284/1696"">Peter's formulas</a> will apply from a design standpoint. The aircraft designer will use something like that to calculate typical values, which will be included in the aircraft's operating handbook.</p>

<p>The table below is listed by pressure altitude and gross weight. At each combination there will be performance values such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Average N1 (for a turbine)</li>
<li>Max TAT for thrust rating</li>
<li>IAS Knots</li>
<li>Mach number</li>
<li>ISA fuel flow LB/HR/ENG</li>
<li>ISA TAS Knots</li>
</ul>

<p>The flight distance will determine the approximate gross weight, which corresponds to an altitude and cruise speed that provide the best efficiency. Here is an example from a <strong>virtual</strong> 737 handbook, with the values I listed. The optimum performance is in blue. Higher gross weights have been removed for clarity.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOaKF.png"" alt=""737-800 Optimum Cruise Altitude Table""></p>

<p>Airlines may have their own performance tables, choosing a custom balance of efficiency and speed. Dispatchers for the airline will take the flight information and decide on a cruising altitude for filing the flight plan, which the pilot will then receive. As you can see, as the aircraft burns fuel and gets lighter, it will be more efficient at higher altitudes. This is the step climb that Peter mentioned, where the aircraft will climb to higher altitudes as the flight progresses when they are cleared by ATC.</p>

<p>Modern planning systems can take into account weather factors such as winds aloft and turbulence to pick the most efficient route.</p>

"Can any aircraft take off using auto-pilot?","11344","","<p>So there are some types of aircraft that can land under auto-pilot (or is that a trope?). Can those same planes go from stop (at the gate) to in-the-air flight without a pilot actually touching a control column/flight-stick?</p>

<p>Caveats: I'm not talking about UAV's. Also, I'm not concerned about ""would you,"" but rather ""could you.""</p>
","<p>If you are asking if a plane can be taken from the gate all the way to the sky by auto-pilot I'm quite certain the answer is no.  Not because a plane can't configure itself for take off and power up the engines (I'm quite certain it can, though I would defer to more knowledgeable people for that).  Not for that reason, but rather because there is no system in place to electronically guide an aircraft through a series of taxiways all the way to the base of the runway so that it can line up to take off in the first place. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, ATC gives a lot of instructions for ground operations, funnelling aircraft this way and that via taxiway A through Z.  They'd have no way of telling an auto-pilot about these directions, there's no computer to send out signals and there is no voice recognition build into the plane.  If you told the pilots, they would have no way to input the instructions into the autopilot, nor would the autopilot know what to do if it ever received such instructions.  It just isn't designed to follow taxiways.</p>

<p>Also, beyond just taxiway layout, there are a lot of planes in close proximity on the ground, plus bunches of other important vehicles (fire trucks, fuel trucks, de-icers, etc.)  Steering around all of those, faultlessly, would be quite the feat.  We've only just gotten to the point where <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV51BGIzkwU"" rel=""nofollow"">a vehicle can drive across open terrain without crashing itself</a>,  I think a plane navigating an airport (and doing it while minding ATC) is a bit of a ways off.</p>

<p>That being said, I'm not changing my answer.  There still, currently, is no way to convey ATC instructions to the aircraft.  </p>

<p>As a point of clarification: I saw the question as asking about technology in it's current state.  Will we eventually be able to do this.  Heck yes, absolutely.  A great deal of the technology is in place and what's left is either right on the horizon or close to it.  FAA clearance will probably take some time, but we'll get there.  I was mainly answer the question from the perspective of modern tech and what is currently ready to be installed on a plane.</p>

"What is the maximum safe bank angle of a 747?","11325","","<p>This question arose during the comments of another question, linked for the curious:

<p>Because the discussion was interesting, (and to avoid congesting the comments of another user's question), I reposted it here.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the answer to this? Official sources/experience are preferred, but I'll take what I can get.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I was at altitude and suddenly realized we were about to cross into airspace that might get us shot down, I would, smoothly, do 3 things simultaneously: (1) start the nose down to around 25 degrees down, (2) start a roll to a bank angle of 60-80 degrees, and (3) start the power back to idle. At the same time, I'd ask the first officer to deploy the speed brakes, which would give me great roll response. –  Terry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>80 degrees of bank would be a bit excessive no? 60 might be reasonable for an emergency turn, but certainly no more in a 747? (G-forces aside) –  HCBPshenanigans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Terry's reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was thinking of a range because, in an emergency turn, hitting an
  exact degree of bank would be hard. I would, however, not want to go
  beyond 90 degrees because of the possible disorienting nature for the
  flight crew. At 60 degrees, approximately 87% of the wings lift would
  be turning the airplane. At 80 degrees, about 98% of the lift would be
  turning the airplane, so the lesser bank would sacrifice 11% of the
  turning force. I would expect to lose a lot altitude in the turn. I
  can't think of a reason not use 80 degrees. Pax comfort would be a
  non-issue. –  Terry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My most recent response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Idk if you are a real 747 captain (there are quite a few on here), but
  iirc many 747 crashes have happened because when the aircraft banks so
  hard that it loses that much vertical lift, it is very difficult to
  recover from. In addition, some flight systems might malfunction under
  these rather extreme conditions. 60, hell even 70, is much steeper
  than it seems. I seem to remember seeing an episode of that old Air Disaster show about just this. –  HCBPshenanigans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: What kind of difference would the difference between 60 and 70 or 80 degrees of roll make in time to turn 360 degrees?</p>
","<p>The descent angle helps to reduce the lift that the wing needs to provide, in two ways. It leads the aircraft into higher density air, where more absolute lift is possible at the same Mach number. That takes a while, but a more immediate effect comes from pointing the aircraft's nose downwards. Then, part of the gravity-induced forces can be counteracted by drag (D in the sketch below). This is similar to a glider, only with much lower aerodynamic efficiency and steeper angles. Terry reduces thrust and opens the speed brakes to avoid overspeeding, so he can dive as steeply as possible, thus reducing lift requirements.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mkYbA.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Now more of the wing's lift L can be employed for turning the aircraft around. If he wants to achieve a constant sink rate, he still has to produce enough lift to balance weight, but reduced by the cosine of the glide path compared to the level flight condition. At 25° nose down, this is a reduction by 10%.</p>

<p>Now you are concerned about his roll angle. Please note that he wants to create as much sideways component of lift as possible, which will look like gravity to all onboard. At 60° roll angle (I think his 80° are a bit extreme), this works out to twice the normal vertical acceleration, and with the dive actually just 1.8 g, so everyone will feel almost twice the force of normal gravity. With the 80° roll, this will not be a stationary turn and not enough lift will remain to counteract gravity, so the aircraft will accelerate downwards during the turn. It will actually fall out of the sky. When already at Mach 0.85, I would be more careful than Terry, because things get ugly very quickly when Mach goes further up.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dsy3O.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The term $m\cdot\frac{v^2}{R}$ is the centrifugal force which can be afforded by the horizontal component of the lift and which needs to be as big as possible for tight turns (a smaller radius R helps). This is the lift component that Terry needs to pull the aircraft around.</p>

<p>If we stay with stationary turns (without the ""falling out of the sky"" part), the maximum bank angle is given by the maximum load factor of the 747. At 400 KEAS, this is just 1.5g, so even with the 25° nose down attitude the maximum bank angle would be 53°. If you fly slightly slower, the load factor goes to 2g (equals 63° in a 25° descent) and tops out at 2.5g at 310 KEAS (68.7° in a 25° descent). Flying at Mach 0.85 in 30.000 ft will produce an equivalent airspeed of 306 kt in normal atmospheric conditions. The precise value varies with the actual flight speed, and the maximum safe bank angle is in the region of 60° to 70°.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: I see, now you want to know the time to turn around. All I can do is <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2871/how-to-calculate-angular-velocity-and-radius-of-a-turn/3477#3477"">calculate it under the assumption that enough lift is available</a>, regardless of buffeting. In reality, I doubt that even the 48° case will give you a pleasant ride. All results are for the 30.000 ft case, because at 36.000 ft those higher bank angles will not be cleanly flyable due to compressibility effects.</p>

<p>At 60° the airplane flies with 2g, and with 25° nose down still at 1.8g. The turn rate would be 3.77°/s and 180° would be completed after 48 s.</p>

<p>At 70° it flies with almost 3g, and with 25° nose down at 2.65 g which is a little outside of the g limits. The turn rate would be 5.98°/s and 180° would be completed after 30 s (plus the time to roll to 70°, which now starts to become important).</p>

<p>The 80° case becomes really hypothetical, because even with the 25° nose down attitude the load factor will be 5.2g if flown without sideslip and enough lift to prevent overspeeding. The 747 will be close to breaking apart, but maybe a future aerobatic version can fly this maneuver safely. It will result in a turn rate of 12.35° and need 14.6 s for a 180° turn. I would add at least 4 seconds to bank to 80°, but the turn can be completed within 20 s. Hypothetically.</p>

<p>What Terry hinted to when he said he would bank to 80° is not the clean turns I am calculating here, but a dynamic dive where the plane accelerates because not enough lift is left to keep it from falling. To compute this, I would need more aerodynamic data on the 747 and need to employ at least a finite difference algorithm or a lot of paper and pencils.</p>

<p>Just that much: If the 747 is rolled to 80° but the pilot pulls only as many gs as the aircraft can sustain (due to buffeting I doubt that even 2.5 g are possible), the lift will almost exclusively serve to fly a tight turn, but not enough will be left to counteract gravity. Therefore, the aircraft will slip sideways, and directional stability will turn the nose downwards. This will take a while (I am guessing maybe 12 seconds, really a guess), but the aircraft will pick up speed from the beginning of the maneuver. I am a little more scared of flying faster than Mach 0.85 than Terry is, and the various reports <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-20/travel/9204250793_1_passenger-plane-freighters-test-pilots"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">of 747s going up to Mach 0.98</a> support his view that a little overspeeding is OK. It is hard for me to guess how much time it needs to become uncomfortably fast, and then a lot of lift will be needed to pull out of the dive. On the other hand, when the airplane is diving, all it needs is a roll and a pull-out to come out at 180° to the previous course. The pull-out will be performed at a much lower altitude, and creating the gs there will not be a problem.</p>

","<p>Initial work on Radar Cross Section (RCS) reduction concentrated on absorbers and had started in Germany late in WW II. The Americans were not interested at the time, but British scientists documented the results and gained early insights in US RCS research when they pooled their results in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Lockheed started work on the systematical reduction of RCS when they discovered the academic papers of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Ufimtsev"" rel=""noreferrer"">Petr Ufimtsev</a>, a Russian mathematician who explained how to calculate the reflection of radio waves from the 1960s on. Their initial success with RCS reduction on the SR-71 was more luck than systematic work. At the same time, similar insights were gained in Germany where a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBB_Lampyridae"" rel=""noreferrer"">manned prototype of an aircraft</a> (MBB Lampyridae) similar to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Have_Blue"" rel=""noreferrer"">Have Blue prototype</a> proceeded until wind tunnel tests. Then the program came to the attention of US authorities which quickly put an end to it.</p>

<p>In all those cases, the major idea was to restrict the surface to large, flat panels because the edges, not the total area, determine how much energy is radiated back. In that respect, the German design was much cleaner than both the Have Blue and the F-117, but I digress. Those designs can be called first-generation stealth aircraft.</p>

<p>When Northrop joined the RCS work, they found that even curved panels work well - after all, it is edge reduction and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1798/do-similar-angles-on-a-plane-make-it-more-stealthy"">alignment</a> which reduces RCS most. Their initial prototype was for a battlefield observation aircraft (in contrast to the Lockheed attack aircraft) which was called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Tacit_Blue"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tacit Blue</a>.</p>

<p>When work on stealth prototypes was opened at the end of the Cold War, all engineers could pool their knowledge and combine the work on absorbers, edge reduction and edge alignment. This gave rise to the second generation of stealth designs which look indeed quite different to those of the first generation. What also influenced the designs was more understanding of the tactical value of stealth, so the second generation designs do not optimize RCS above all else but arrive at a compromise which <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/36026/why-do-the-f-22-and-f-35-look-similar-to-each-other-and-different-from-previous/36031#36031"">combines low frontal RCS with good agility</a> and multi-role capabilities.</p>

<p>Koyovis is right, but it was not only computer power but also the limitations of early RCS codes which were based - at least in case of Lockheed - on the ideas of Petr Ufimtsev, and he in turn used analytical methods which did not allow to investigate the RCS of curved surfaces. However, the computers at the time were already powerful enough to allow the F-117 to fly at all - in contrast to the MBB design, it is unstable and uncontrollable without artificial stabilization.</p>

<p>In recent times, especially, it's a rare incident that a plane crashed and even some of its passengers survived. So, why has this issue not yet been resolved?</p>
","<h2>Short answer</h2>

<p>The kinetic energy involved in a plane crash is inhumanely high.</p>

<h2>Slightly longer answer</h2>

<p>We can built bombs which will go through concrete roofs and ceilings of a bunker, counting the number of floors they crash through while descending so they can explode at the level where the bad guys sit and not where the widows and orphans are kept. We could equally well build a plane with this kind of strength, so the fuselage stays intact even when it crashes into a mountainside. That's not the problem.</p>

<h2>Limits of the human body</h2>

<p>The problem will be that rescuers will only find dead bodies inside. The human body was ""designed"" to endure things like running into a tree, but not being hurled around at Mach 0.85 and then being stopped almost instantly. Thanks to years of research we now have quite a good idea where the limits are. Martin Eiband collected a lot of data on this, if you want to know more, google for ""Eiband diagrams"". If you want the full picture, read the <a href=""http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA218434"" rel=""noreferrer"">Army Aircraft Crash Survival Guide</a>. It comes in five volumes, and volume 1 covers the design criteria. The Eiband diagram below is lifted from this source.

<p>Note the time scale: A deceleration with 40 g can only be tolerated for a duration of 0.1 seconds; if the deceleration takes more than 1 second, the limit is only 10 g. Now let's see what deceleration distance is required to stop a human with an average deceleration of 10 g. The energy $E$ of a body of the mass $m$ increases with the square of speed $v$:
$$E = m\cdot\frac{v^2}{2} = m\cdot a\cdot s$$
At $a = 98.0665$ m/s², the stopping distance $s$ from an initial speed $v$ is $\frac{v^2}{2\cdot a}$:</p>

<li>Car crash at 30&nbsp;m/s: This needs 4.6&nbsp;m and good restraints, but is generally survivable.</li>

<li>Airliner flies into a mountain (240&nbsp;m/s): 293.7&nbsp;m. To make such a crash survivable, every airliner would need to carry a 300 m boom of stiff material around which would be needed as a crumple zone in an accident. Just think what kind of aft fuselage and tail this would require.</li>
<li>And to top it: Astronaut on a space walk collides with a satellite in an opposing orbit (16,000&nbsp;m/s): 1305.23&nbsp;km. Note that I had to switch units to keep the number manageable.</li>

<p>Please consider lower deceleration limits for elderly and untrained persons; the limit in the Eiband diagram was established using healthy young pilots (and hogs, chimps and corpses for the higher limits. A lot of blood was spilled to arrive at these numbers).</p>

<p>How does the pilot deal with turbulence? Does he or she keep the same altitude? The same speed (relative to the wind)? Increase power?  AoA? </p>
","<p>Most of the time the turbulence we experience is termed ""chop"", which is akin to what you experience on a boat on the lake -- bumps but no real altitude deviations.  With altitude deviations we'll call it ""turbulence"".  Within these broad categories we'll qualify them with ""light"", ""moderate"", ""severe"" and ""extreme"" in reports to ATC and other aircraft.  These reports do suffer from a fair bit of subjectivity with respect to aircraft type (wing stiffness) and pilot experience.  </p>

<p>If it is light chop, I'll generally just ride it out and turn the seatbelt signs on.</p>

<p>The first thing I'll do if encountering moderate chop or turbulence is to query ATC and get ride reports from aircraft ahead of us and at different altitudes than us.  From this information I'll make a determination to ride it out or to request a climb/descent.  If the turbulence was particularly bad, slowing down was an option, but I only came across that need a few times.  Our ability to descend would often be limited by route length and fuel and major lateral deviations also depended on contingency fuel, so in some cases we had no choice but to stay in the chop.  If the turbulent areas were well forecast or had lots of PIREPS, our dispatchers would sometimes route us differently.</p>

<p>The real reason helicopters don't routinely fly to those altitudes is that they're not designed to. As with everything in aviation, performance is a trade off between engineering, aerodynamics and commercial pressures. </p>

<p>There's a big market for helicopters that can fly up to, say, 12-15,000ft. The market for helicopters capable of rescuing climbers from the top of Everest is, at best, limited, and the technical demands of building a craft routinely capable of such a flight will push the costs up dramatically.</p>

<p>In short, they don't because nobody will pay for it.</p>

"What is Class F airspace, and why is it not used in the US?","11062","","<p>I've read that ICAO defines Class F airspace but the FAA has chosen not to use the airspace class in the US. What is the ICAO definition of Class F airspace and how does it differ from other airspace classes? What countries use Class F airspace? Why does the FAA only use A-E and G?</p>
","<p>ICAO Class F airspace is a bit of an odd duck (and the US FAA is apparently not the only agency that thinks so - from a quick check on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class"">Wikipedia</a> it seems more jurisdictions ignore class F than implement it. They only mention Class F as being in use in Germany and the UK).</p>

<p>From a functional/regulatory standpoint Class F is a sort of hybrid between ""Class E"" controlled airspace and ""Class G"" (fully) uncontrolled airspace:<br>
Class F airspace is designated as ""uncontrolled"", but you can get ATC clearances in Class F airspace just like in controlled airspace. The catch is they're ""advisory only"" (so you don't <em>have</em> to comply with them, and all the weight is on the pilot's shoulders ). Similarly ATC will provide separation services to IFR flights in Class F airspace, but they do so ""where possible"", which means they might tell you they can't provide that service and you're on your own with see-and-avoid.  </p>

<p>The general use case for Class F airspace seems to be allowing IFR flights to operate in ""uncontrolled airspace"".</p>

<hr>

<p>As a US pilot (and thus having no experience with Class F Airspace), it sounds like the services provided in Class F airspace are effectively the equivalent of <a href=""http://flighttraining.aopa.org/students/crosscountry/articles/2931.html"">VFR Traffic Advisories (""Flight Following"")</a>: Controllers can give you advisories and make <em>suggestions</em>, but all responsibility is ultimately still on the pilot's shoulders, and you can politely tell the controller to get stuffed if you don't like their suggestions (without needing to declare an emergency to vest yourself with that authority).</p>

<p>In the US we already have the Flight Following system and culture set up for VFR folks (and generally speaking it's available nationwide, irrespective of airspace class, as long as the controller can get you on radar and isn't overworked). We also have a pretty robust Class E airspace nationwide.<br>
Because of this the FAA probably sees no need to designate specific ""Class F"" regions where IFR flights can get the equivalent of ""Flight Following"": If you're VFR you can usually get flight following if you want it, and if you're IFR you should have no trouble staying in controlled airspace (Class A, B, C, D, or E) for your entire route of flight.</p>

"Why are traditional knobs not replaced by touchscreens in cockpits?","11053","","<p>Looking at this picture of an A380 cockpit I see that there are still a lot of traditional switches (meaning manual click on and off or knobs). Being technology so advanced in these days, why is it that traditional switches and knobs are used instead of having a couple of touch screens on which the various controls are placed?</p>

<p>Wouldn't this make it more economic as there would be savings on material and wiring? They could also be less susceptible to failures as traditional switches and knobs still rely on mechanical actions.</p>

<p>Another advantage I could think of is that every pilot could customise positioning of controls and switches based on his/her way of piloting. This could then be reset to a default state every time a new pilot takes over.</p>

","<p>Adding a pilot's perspective to what others have said:</p>

<p>Look at the switches and knobs in an airplane up close some time. You'll notice that nearly all of them have different textures,heights,sizes or shapes. That's intentional. Pilots train and train and train and train on checklists, especially the emergency ones. Muscle memory is a big part of quickly and correctly executing an emergency checklist.</p>

<p>As an example, flap levers/switches normally have a cap or top that is flat and parallel to the wings. It's easy to identify solely by touch.</p>

<p>Checklist item: ""flaps up""
Action: Hand to flap lever (automatic after doing it a hundred times in training), verify feel of lever, move, look to verify</p>

<p>Without the tactile element, every motion would have to be verified by looking before it's made. With the tactile element, the movement can be made and then verified visually while the hand is moving to the next item. In an emergency, every second counts and the savings from tactile + verify matters.</p>

<p>Beyond emergency procedures, they're simply safer. The plane I fly the most has a touch screen display and several non touch devices. In turbulence, the touch screen is basically useless. But, the important devices all have buttons and knobs. I can be banging my head on the ceiling (literally) and still adjust the auto-pilot or radio. In that kind of turbulence, the touch screen device is completely useless.</p>

"What safety features prevent jets sucking in ground staff or equipment?","11026","","<p>There have been some gruesome deaths involving ground staff being sucked into jet engines, presumably because the engine thrust was set well above idle. Are there safety features (besides prudence on the flight deck) that are designed to mitigate this risk?</p>
","<p>No, there are no safety <em>features</em>. Only safety <em>procedures</em> on the flight deck and on the ground.</p>

<p>Basically it all boils down to that nobody may go near any aircraft (jet or prop; they are both similarly dangerous) that may have engines running. When starting the engines, the pilots first turn on the beacon (the red flashing lights on the belly and tail), then check the ground crew has left and only then start the engine(s). And similarly upon landing, the pilots shut the engines down, wait a bit to let them spool down and turn off the beacons; then the ground crew should ask (via radio or the wired intercom connected to a socket at the nose) whether the engines are indeed off and only then they may start working.</p>

<p>Since start-up normally only happens after push-back, so away from the terminal, there is usually no risk then. Upon arrival however the ground crew needs to come to the aircraft relatively quickly and insert chocks to the wheels, so the correct procedures are important.</p>

<p><a href=""http://avherald.com/h?article=46a4ba8a"">Here see a recent accident</a> where ground worker was injured because the procedures were not followed (he was coming from the rear, so he was only blown away, not sucked in).</p>

<li>suction danger 2.2m (7.2ft) from engines (semicircle forward and to the sides of the engine and back to 1.5m behind the inlet) and</li>
<li>exhaust danger to 55m (180ft) behind the nozzles with 30° spread with exhaust velocity exceeding 105km/h (65mi/h) for 17m (55ft) aft of the nozzles.</li>

<p>At full power the suction area grows to 5.9m (19.5ft) radius and the exhaust danger to 275m (900ft) with velocity over 105km/h down to 150m (500ft) aft.</p>

"Why do turbine engines take so long to spool up?","10991","","<p>Piston engines reach full rpm within a second or two, but turbines take much longer. Why is that?</p>
","<p>I'm not an engineer (which might be better suited to answer this) so this is from simplified things they feed pilots:</p>

<p>Jet engines take much longer to spool up (i.e. increase RPM) than piston engines, especially at low RPM because of the pressure ratio/increased airflow necessary to keep the compressor from stalling/surging/blowing up every time when changing power settings.</p>

<p>The (simplified) jet engine cycle contains a compressor that pushes air into a combustion chamber, where it burns, and then blows out the rear end rotating a turbine that moves the compressor from back where we started at. </p>

<p>If you ""add more power"" (i.e. put more fuel in) it takes a while for that extra fuel to produce more thrust, which in turn takes a while to accelerate the turbine, which will make the compressor spin faster, which will finally bring more compressed air into the combustion chamber to utilize all that extra fuel you poured in at step 1. </p>

<p>Adding power all of a sudden will increase the pressure in the combustion chamber, so much that air that is ""upstream"" (i.e still in the compressor) does not want to advance. The extra pressure in the combustion chamber did not have enough time to spool up the turbine, so now the compressor is underpowered to keep ""pushing"" compressed air into the combustion chamber. Air starts flowing backwards (i.e. from combustion chamber to compressor), engine surges, all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>So there is a lag (electronically these days, the pilots can floor the trust levers as fast as they like) when the engines are at low RPM, the FADEC only adds a little bit of extra fuel, waits for the airflow to stabilize, then adds a little more, and so on.</p>

<p>I think the graph below might explain this. Every time you change RPM, you will increase Pressure Ratio (i.e. move up the graph), then you wait a little bit for Air Mass Flow to increase (i.e. move right). If you increase the Pressure Ratio too much, without the accompanying mass flow (which take a while because of inertia) you will enter the surge line.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpOCY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A similar thing happens on spool down, albeit a gentler one.</p>

<p>Compare this with the piston engine where you put more air/gas mixture into the cylinder, it makes for a bigger bang, accelerates the piston faster, and the very next piston cycle you can theoretically get max power.</p>

"Is there a maximum possible size for an airplane?","10985","","<p>Is there any theoretical or practical limit to the maximum number of passengers - and therefore size - one can build an airplane for?</p>
","<p>Yes, there is an upper limit, but that upper limit might change with technological innovation. </p>

<p>An airplane flies because of the lift coefficient $L=\frac12\rho v^2 A C_L$, with $v$ the airspeed, which is a combination of the speed of the plane and the wind speed, $\rho \approx 1 \, \text{kg m}^{-3}$ at a theoretical mimimum of 5 km height (remember that most planes reach 10 km, but I took this a little more extreme to show an upper limit), $A$ the area, and $C_L$ an coefficent with a typical value less than 2, that might change with technological innovation.</p>

<p>So the only factors we can influence are $v$ and $A$. However, if we increase $A$, the mass $m$ increases faster than the area $A$ because there is more material needed to avoid the plane form breaking under the huge forces. Increasing $A$ quadratically gives more than a quadratically in $m$, and hence in the needed $L$.</p>

<p>If we increase $v$, we need more fuel. The amount of fuel per distance unit increases linearily in $v$, because it increases quadratically per unit of time in $v$. Hence $L$ increases quadratically where $m$ only increases linearily. This means that we might do something with increasing $v$. That means that airplanes have to go faster before liftoff, which will need drastically longer takeoff lanes.
Note that we can't keep increasing $v$ because we can't lose control. </p>

<p>In summary, things we can improve are $v$, the speed, $C_L$, with technological innovations and $\rho$ by lowering flying height. However, it is not practical.</p>

"Accelerated Stall, what is it, how do you prevent it?","10972","","<p>I've read a lot of NTSB crash reports regarding small, GA aircraft (just trying to figure out what went wrong and what to avoid.)  There seem to be a lot of reports that talk about ""low altitude high speed stalls"" (accelerated stall) happening on approach.</p>

<p>What is an accelerated stall, and how is it created?  What is the best way to avoid one?  As they seem to cause a lot of GA accidents...</p>
","<h1>Short Version</h1>

<p>An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs at an airspeed higher than normal due to a higher load factor (g loading).</p>

<h1>Longer Version</h1>

<p>When an aircraft is in a bank or when pulling back on the yoke quickly, the wing has to create additional lift to support the aircraft since the load factor has increased.  This increases the angle of attack beyond the critical angle of attack (the point where the wings can no longer produce enough lift to support the airplane) and the airplane will stall even though it is above the normal stall speed for the airplane.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRuQl.png"" alt=""Load Factor Explained""></p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p>Let's say that we are flying an airplane that has a ""normal"" stall speed of 60 KIAS.  If we start a 60 degree banked turn, this will increase the load factor on the airplane by two (2g) and will increase our stall speed by 41% to 85 KIAS.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lW1M0.gif"" alt=""Load Factor Chart""></p>

<p>A fairly common cause of this type of accident is when a pilot overshoots the runway centerline during the turn from base to final and steepens the bank angle in order to ""turn faster"" to get back on final.  Because the stall speed goes up, they can stall the airplane even though they normally never even come close at their current airspeed.  </p>

<p>Instead, they should have just maintained the current bank angle that they had (instead of steepening it) and continued the turn back to re-intercept final using normal maneuvers.  If that couldn't be done in the amount of altitude/distance available, then simply go around and come back to try again (while making the proper wind correction in the turns this time).</p>

"How much force does a 747 land with?","10948","","<p>I've been told before that the runways for large commercial aircraft have to be built to withstand a large amount of force.  But I'm wondering exactly how much it is?  When a 747 touches down, how much force is being imparted from the wheels to the tarmac?  And, further, how much force is imparted into the runway while the plan is braking right after touchdown?</p>

<p>Bonus Points:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much weight does the gear + the wheels absorb and dissipate?</li>
<li>I'm sure there's a range from a ""greaser"" landing with light braking all the way to whatever the highest the main gear is rated for, it would be nice to know both extremes and the mean.</li>
</ul>
","<p>I do not know the exact numbers for oleo stroke and so on, but this is how you would calculate this. A 747-400 weighs 400 tons on take-off and 296 tons on landing, maximum. See <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/startup/pdf/747_perf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for the source of those figures.</p>

<p>Next is the landing speed, this is approx. 160 knots = 82 m/s. Now let's assume the pilot has misjudged the height and does not flare, but slams the aircraft with the 3° approach angle into the runway. It is supposed to survive this, so let's just continue. This gives you a vertical speed of 4.3 m/s, and at 296 tons this is an energy of 2,750 kWs = 0.76 kWh, which needs to be dissipated by the landing gear. Now I make the assumption that the gear stroke is 0.5 m (those who know please put it in the comments, and I will correct the calculation). We have 0.5 m to decelerate a mass of 296 tons from 4.3 m/s to zero. If we assume a constant deceleration, the force will also be constant and the sink speed will decrease linearly.</p>

<p>The average sink speed during this process is 2.15 m/s, so it will take 0.23 s and an acceleration of 18.5 m/s$^2$. Force is mass times acceleration, so the force is 5,473 kN or 1.23 million pounds. This is just the inertial force to stop the descent. While taxiing to the take-off position, the aircraft will press with 400 tons = 878,000 lbs on the runway, since the wings do not yet produce any lift. This shows that even a hard landing does not stress the landing gear so much - after all, the acceleration is just shy of 2 g, acting on a much lighter plane.</p>

<p>In reality, the landing gear of a 747 is staggered, so the inner main gears will touch the ground first. Also, I expect that the force will not be constant along the whole gear stroke. This will change the details of this approximation, but the general magnitude should not be different.</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7485/jet-aviation-on-rough-airfields/7496#7496"">This answer</a> goes into more details on how to calculate the damage an airplane will do to a given runway or apron.</p>

<p>Now for the braking stresses. The landing field length of a 747-400 is 2175 m, and let's just assume that the pilot forgot to use thrust reversers, aerodynamic drag was switched off that day, and all the braking power had to be supplied by the 16 main wheels. Let's also assume that the pilot uses 1200 m of that field length for braking (I'm just making this up to get to an upper limit of what force will act on the tarmac). Now we need to decelerate from 82 m/s to zero within 1200 m. Linear deceleration means an average speed of 41 m/s, so the whole process takes 29.27 s. Dividing speed by time yields a deceleration of 2.8 m/s$^2$. </p>

<p>To bring the aircraft to a full stop, we have an energy of 995,152 kWs = 276.4 kWh to dissipate along a distance of 1200 m. Using again Newton's second law, we see that this requires a horizontal force of 829 kN = 186,322 lbs, which translates into 51,8 kN = 11,645 lbs per wheel. This is certainly more than what happens in reality, but to put it into proportion: The static load per main wheel at the maximum landing mass is 174 kN = 39,150 lbs (assuming that 4% of the mass is carried by the nose gear). This extreme (horizontal) braking force is still less than 30% of the (vertical) static load, which is well below of the maximum braking coefficient of an aircraft wheel on a dry runway. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
CGCampell correctly remarked that emergency procedures at take-off weight will produce the biggest braking loads. Now I will calculate the highest possible braking loads, and for this I need this plot of a polynominal for the braking coefficient, which is the ratio between vertical and horizontal forces before the tire skids. I do not know the source; I collected it somewhere in the past and never found a reason to doubt its validity.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uW35x.png"" alt=""tire friction coefficient""></p>

<p>Shortly before the aircraft comes to a stop, the highest friction coefficient is reached, and then little lift is produced by the wings, so the vertical tire loads are those of the static case. At 96% of 400 tons acting on 16 wheels, this is 24 tons = 235,344 N = 52,907 lbs of downward force per wheel. Since the friction coefficient is 1 at low speed, the same load is transferred horizontally from each wheel to the ground, almost five times more than what I approximated for the landing above. Clearly, going to the limits produces much higher loads.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Formulas used in the calculation:</h2>

<p><strong>How to calculate the deceleration of a mass $m$ from a speed $v_0$ to $v_1$</strong></p>

<p>Energy has no absolute value, we just add or subtract energy. The amount of energy change $∆E$ between the aircraft at a speed $v_0$ and at a speed $v_1$ is:
$$∆E = \frac{m}{2}\cdot (v_0^2 - v_1^2)$$</p>

<p>The unit of energy is the Joule, which equals the Watt-second or the Newton-meter. Thus 1&nbsp;J =&nbsp;1&nbsp;Ws =&nbsp;1&nbsp;Nm =&nbsp;1&nbsp;$\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}$. Metric units are neat, right?</p>

<p>In physics, energy $E$ equals work $W$, and work is performed when a force $F$ travels along a distance $s$. As does the braking force, acting on the moving aircraft:
$$E = W = F_{brake}\cdot s$$</p>

<p><strong>How do we get the rollout distance $s$?</strong></p>

<p>We use the fact that the energy change due to deceleration equals the brake energy:
$$\frac{m}{2}\cdot (v_0^2 - v_1^2) = F_{brake}\cdot s \Leftrightarrow s =  \frac{m}{2\cdot F_{brake}}\cdot (v_0^2 - v_1^2)$$</p>

<p><strong>How can we find the time $t$ it takes to slow the aircraft down?</strong></p>

<p>If the force is constant, the acceleration $a = \frac{m}{F}$ is constant, too. So the speed over time $v(t)$ is:
$$v(t) = v_0 + a\cdot t$$</p>

<p>We decelerate, so $a$ is a negative number. But the same works for a positive acceleration, too. To find the time $∆t = t_1 - t_0$ we make use of the fact that v varies linearly over time, such that the average speed is the arithmetic mean between $v_0$ and $v_1$. And time is just distance divided by speed:
$$∆t = \frac{2\cdot s}{v_0 + v_1} = \frac{m\cdot s}{F_{brake}\cdot(v_0 + v_1)}\cdot (v_0^2 - v_1^2)$$</p>

<p>With such formulas it is always a good idea to compare the units on both sides. Yup, seconds, so the result is really a time.</p>

"Why aren't cell phones allowed to be used in aircraft?","10927","","<p>What problems do cell phones cause? How is using a cell phone in the air different than using it from the ground?</p>
","<p><strong>Why aren't cell phones allowed?/ What problems to cell phones cause?</strong></p>

<p>Most of these cases apparently originate from a series of <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/5947-real-reason-cell-phone-banned-airlines.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unexplained events</a> in the 90s which were believe to be caused by electronic gadgets, hence the ban. This was when cell phones appeared, and there was an aggressive ban as a result. NASA has a <a href=""http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/docs/rpsts/ped.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list</a> which includes some of these and makes for an interesting read. </p>

<p>Now however an increasing list of airlines is allowing them again, depending on jurisdiction. FAA is <a href=""http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/10/faa-ban-lifted/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">working on allowing it</a> from a regulatory standpoint. Bear in mind that phones were probably much more powerful back when these rules were introduced.</p>

<p>Mythbuster (episode 6, 2006) did a test on this by sticking in a powerful transmitter into a business jet. Their <a href=""http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/cell-phones-interfere-plane-instruments.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website</a> gives a slightly different version: It was the FCC, not the FAA, who led the way for this regulation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explanation: Never mind what the chatterbox in the seat next to you
  says about cell phones messing with plane navigation — those metallic
  birds are built airtight against foreign signals and operate on
  entirely different frequencies than cell phones.</p>
  
  <p>So why all the fuss about phones? When you make a call at 10,000 feet,
  the signal bounces off multiple available cell towers, rather than one
  at a time. That means too many phone-happy jetsetters might clog up
  the networks on the ground, which is why the Federal Communications
  Commission (FCC) — not the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) — banned
  cell use on planes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How is using a cell phone in the air different than using it from the ground?</strong></p>

<p>Is it sensible to allow them on aircraft? To quote one of the above sources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>although the FAA recommends that you still switch to airplane mode
  because you’re not going to get a signal 30,000 feet in the air — the
  only hit you’ll take is a dead battery when you land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it's probably not a huge loss if you're flying commercial aircraft at 10,000 meters. In any case, you can't expect a service like you do on the ground, unless like Lnafziger says that the aircraft is equipped with a cellular basestation called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picocell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Picocell</a>, illustrated below:</p>

<li>The SU-25 has an operational ceiling of 16000 ft with max weapons to 23000 ft clean, MH17 was at 33000 ft.</li>

"Why was my flight cancelled due to bad weather while other flights were not?","10797","","<p>I'm stuck in Frankfurt. I missed my connection due to a delay. I was rebooked, but this new flight was also cancelled due to bad weather. </p>

<p>About 30 percent of all flights were cancelled today. However, if the weather is that bad, shouldn't all departures have been cancelled? Why was the weather bad for my flight, but not for other flights that actually departed? </p>
","<p>In general, flights get cancelled when arriving flights are delayed or themselves cancelled. Your flight needs three critical things to depart on time, or at all:</p>

<ol>
<li>an airplane,</li>
<li>flight + cabin crew, and</li>
<li>weather that meets requirements</li>
</ol>

<p>Aircraft may not arrive due to weather diversions (couldn't land with fuel on hand, etc). If there's no airplane, your flight obviously can't depart. Same goes for bad weather at your departure airport - if it's too bad, you can't go. If the weather at your destination is bad, the flight may also be delayed because the airport can't handle as many aircraft as normal. That's fairly straightforward. Where it gets most complicated is the crew.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=6762"" rel=""noreferrer"">Crew have what are referred to as ""duty and rest requirements"" (at least in the US; other jurisdictions have similar rules, possibly with a different name)</a>. A flight crew is ""on duty"" when they're first <em>scheduled to fly</em>, whether the flight happens or not, and the number of ""duty hours"" they can have on a given day are limited. The FAA <a href=""https://www.thebalance.com/faa-final-rule-pilot-duty-and-rest-requirements-282927"" rel=""noreferrer"">last revised these rules in 2011</a>, as far as I know, but I'm not an airline pilot. With the 2011 rules, ""Flight Duty Period limits under the new rules range from nine to 14 hours"". These rules exist to prevent <a href=""https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Fatigue"" rel=""noreferrer"">fatigue, a major cause of aviation accidents</a>.</p>

<p>What this means is that if weather delays cause crews to overfly their limits, they may be unable to operate the outbound flight. With your example of Frankfurt, there is weather causing delays to arriving flights. </p>

<h3>For example...</h3>

<p>If a hypothetical crew with a 10 hour duty limit was scheduled to fly, say, three LHR-FRA round trips (call it 3 hours of flight duty time each round trip; this may not be a valid example), but were delayed on their third FRA arrival by 2 hours, they would exceed their duty limits by 1 hour on the return flight (<code>1.5 * 2 + 1.5 * 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 9.5 + 1.5 = 11 &gt; 10</code>). As a result, they would not legally be able to depart.</p>

<p>Normally, airlines plan for this with ""reserve"" crews that are on call to fill in for missing, sick, overflown, or otherwise unavailable crews so that flights are not seriously delayed. When a huge storm hits, this falls apart as there are not enough reserve crews to operate all the flights, and the situation snowballs out of control.</p>

<p>Our hypothetical crew would be replaced by reserve pilots (and cabin crew) if they were available, and the flight might be delayed by more than the 2-hour flight delay they experienced. If not, the flight would be canceled.</p>

"What do jet pilots say during the takeoff as they are speeding down the runway?","10782","","<p>I was watching a documentary on youtube and the pilots always say something that sounds like ""B1E"" when they have enough speed to take off. What exactly are they saying, and why do they say it?</p>
","<p>What you are hearing is ""V-One"", written as V<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>It actually is said when they can no longer safely abort the takeoff with the remaining runway, but they still are not quite ready to takeoff.</p>

<p>As they get a little faster, there should then be a second callout of ""Rotate"" when they have achieved the required takeoff speed, and that is when they actually takeoff.</p>

<p>To answer the ""why"" part, it is said by the pilot who isn't actually flying the airplane since he has more time to monitor the speed and can say it at exactly the right time.  It alerts the other pilot that it is no longer safe to abort the takeoff and that pretty much no matter what happens now, they should continue and come back to land if needed.</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>In my answer above, I simplified somewhat by only mentioning the available runway.  There are other factors that can come into play even with a runway that is longer than needed.  One example would be the speed after which the brakes can no longer stop the airplane because they would over-heat and become ineffective.  This is known as the brake energy limit, and it is not safe to abort above this speed, even if you have ""plenty"" of runway.</p>

<p>V<sub>1</sub> must be calculated or looked up prior to every takeoff, along with the other performance numbers.  They vary based on the weight of the aircraft, the configuration of the aircraft, the altitude of the runway, and the weather (outside temperature, wind, etc.).  Sometimes this is done via a computer and sometimes manually via lookup tables or even graphs.</p>

<p>For an example of the graphs, and more information about how temperature and altitude affect takeoff performance, see my previous answer here:<br>
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/1533/69"" title=""Takeoff Performance"">Does temperature affect takeoff performance?</a></p>

<p>There are also times when a pilot may increase or decrease V<sub>1</sub> intentionally, even when it is not required.  For instance, if there is wet ice on the runway it may not be safe to abort even at a very low speed, so you would be forced to continue no matter what (note that I'm NOT saying that this is a good idea). Using a lower power setting to extend engine life is another example, and you can read about it in my question here:<br>
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/472/69"">Why would an airplane pilot choose to intentionally use more runway than required for a takeoff?</a></p>

<p>For way more information than you probably care about takeoff performance, see my other answer here:
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/3567/69"">Minimum Runway Length and V<sub>1</sub></a></p>

<p>In closing, aircraft performance planning is a rather complicated subject and it is only one of many subjects that we must master in order to safely fly an airplane.  This only just scratches the surface of it, and there is a lot more that must be considered (such as ""hey, will we be able to out-climb that tree off the end of the runway?"").</p>

"Why do many fighter jets have double vertical stabilizers?","10768","","<p>Many fighter jets have double vertical stabilizers, e.g. F-14, F-15, F/A-18, F-22:</p>

<p>On the contrary, most general aviation planes and commercial airliners do not. While there are certainly exceptions in both categories, I think it is fair to say that this design is, comparatively, far more common in fighter jets.</p>

<p>What is the advantage of double vertical stabilizers? Why is it common in fighter jets?</p>
","<p>Though the reasons for having twin vertical stabilizers vary from aircraft to aircraft and is mainly a design decision, there are some advantages in having twin vertical stabilizers. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Having twin rudders increases the redundancy, which is important for combat aircraft in case of battle damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Having twin vertical stabilizers helps in reduction in height, though this is mainly an issue with naval aircraft. As an example, both the S-3 Viking and A-5 Vigilante had to fold their vertical tails for fitting inside hangars.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>In case of twin engined aircraft with engines spaced wide apart, having twin rudders helps in getting sufficient rudder authority in case of an engine failure. </p></li>
<li><p>Having twin vertical stabilizers reduces their size, resulting in reduced stress at stabilizer root and reduction in weight. </p></li>
<li><p>One advantage of having twin vertical stabilizers is that the location of vertical tails helps in having control authority at high alpha (where the fuselage/wing can blank a single vertical stabilizer).</p></li>
<li><p>In modern stealth aircraft, having a twin tail enables them to be canted, helping in reducing RCS. Except for tailless aircraft (like B-2), almost all other stealth aircraft have canted twin tails.</p></li>
<li><p>Some aircraft, like A-10 had twin tails that were designed to mask engine exhaust from ground to ensure better survivability.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the end of the day, having a single or twin vertical tail is a design decision and is taken based on the requirements. For example, preliminary designs of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_A-5_Vigilante"" rel=""noreferrer"">A-5 Vigilante</a> had twin tails, while the final design had a single tail, while it was the other way in case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat"" rel=""noreferrer"">F-14 Tomcat</a>.</p>

"What does it cost to get an ATP certificate from scratch?","10765","","<p>If someone decides to become a professional pilot - meaning an airline or business jet pilot in the USA - what does it cost to get the certifications and ratings and build enough hours to become employable? Let's assume that the person is starting from scratch and works through private, instrument, commercial and ATP qualifications.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of a scenario where someone already has a career and income but decides to change to flying and is able to invest the necessary time and money. Of course this could include other commercial flying jobs along the way - like crop dusting or banner towing - but the idea would be to eventually reach a position that pays a decent salary. ""Decent"" isn't very precise but I mean something much higher than the low regional salaries mentioned in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/777/why-are-regional-airline-wages-barely-above-federal-minimum-wage"">this question</a>.</p>
","<p>The cost from 0 to ATP can be highly variable.  An easier number to quantify is 0 - Commercial/CFI.</p>

<p>Even the cost of 0 - Comm/CFI can vary, but there are a few accelerated programs that offer this.  One service (I'm not advertising, so I'm not naming them) offers a program that lasts 150 days and costs $65,000* + checkride expenses.  You start with nothing and end up with single/multi commercial, an instrument rating and your CFI/MEI/II along with 100 hours multi-engine time.  This particular program (and others like it probably) hires their instructors from within, so there is a possibility for multi-instruction -- but you won't be making much money for it.</p>

<p>The cost of commercial to ATP is harder to nail down because of the possibilities that open up post-commercial.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the high end, you could just rent or buy time to ATP mins, but that could cost a fortune.  </p></li>
<li><p>On the low end you could work to ATP mins and make some money.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A good way to make money with a fresh commercial/cfi ticket is to instruct. There are also jobs like banner towing or pipeline/powerline patrol you could do, but you probably still need to build time beyond commercial mins to be competitive for those jobs.  You also mention cropdusting, but keep in mind many of those ops are turbine powered ag-cats and you won't be competitive there with a fresh commercial ticket.  </p>

<p>Without wanting to give away too much information about the film, a Spitfire pilot is flying over part of The Channel. They lose their engine and state the sea looks calm and opt to ditch over bailing out.</p>

<p>Why would a Spitfire pilot choose to do this? Is ditching in the sea really safer than parachuting out?</p>
","<p>Bailing out the cockpit during that era was neither an easy nor always a successful task. The pilot had to either roll the plane, open the canopy, and release themselves to the void, or if rolling wasn't possible, walk on the wing and jump.</p>

<p>That's inherently unsafe. Don't forget that you are not exiting a healthy plane. There might be smoke, debris, fire, propellers spinning, the tail that might cross your way out.</p>

<p>Read what happened to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Marseille#Death"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hans-Joachim Marseille</a> when he tried to bail out. Quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the left side of his chest striking the vertical stabiliser of his fighter, either killing him instantly or rendering him unconscious to the point that he could not deploy his parachute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, regarding ditching versus bailing out, I don't have any source to substantiate the chances of survival, because in the end, what matters is to get out of there alive. But I guess it depends on many factors, one of them being the sea state as they mention in the film.</p>

<p>Another one is the type of damage the airframe has sustained. It might be better to risk a ""gentle"" contact with the water if there is no ""urgent reason"" to leave the plane and you can ditch reasonably soon, than to exit the cockpit and increase the chance of being injured by anything that I've mentioned in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Finally, it turns out that the choice heavily depends on the situation. I haven't seen the movie so besides the ""sea state"" I don't know the details. So provided that you are above a water mass capable of supporting the ditching idea, the factors mostly influencing the decision are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Airframe condition</li>
<li>Altitude below you as Pete pointed out and Philip Johnson mentioned in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/42330/878"">his answer</a>. Too low and you might not have time to deploy parachute.</li>
<li>Sea state</li>

"How to calculate the Lift Coefficient for the A320?","10649","","<p>I'm trying to figure out the lift coefficient of an A320.</p>

<p>What I'm doing is the following: during cruise, the lift is equal to the weight of the aircraft ($mg$) so that I used the cruise table taken from the FCOM to get the speed, the wing area is known ($122.6 m^2$) and I calculated using a <a href=""http://aero.stanford.edu/stdatm.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">tool online</a> the air density at FL290 (29,000 ft).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9g9N.png"" alt=""""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result is that the lift coefficient is $0.03029$. Is it right for the assumptions given above?</p>

<p>Next, if I want to relate the $C_L$ with the Angle of Attack, what is the formula and the procedure?</p>
","<p>I found a  different number for $C_L$, please check your calculation:</p>

<p>$C_L=\frac{2 m g}{\rho V^2 S}$</p>

<p>substitute: 
$
m = 50000 \textrm{ kg}\\
g = 9.81 \textrm{ m}/\textrm{s}^2\\
V = 462 \textrm{ KTAS} = 237.67\textrm{ m/s}\\
S = 122.6 \textrm{ m}^2\\
\rho = 0.475 \textrm{ kg}/\textrm{m}^3
$</p>

<p>This will give:
$C_L = 0.298$</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that this lift coefficient is for the total aircraft. It includes the lift of the wing, the fuselage lift and also the negative lift of the vertical stabilizer. There is also a small vertical component of thrust that is neglected.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that we have an estimate of the lift coefficient, we can estimate the angle of attack. Normally the lift coefficient is assumed to vary linearly with the angle of attack:</p>

<p>$C_L = \frac{\textrm{d}C_L}{\textrm{d}\alpha}\cdot (\alpha-\alpha_0)$</p>

<p>$\alpha_0$ is the zero-lift angle of attack, the angle of attack at which the wing does not generate any lift. For symmetric airfoils, $\alpha_0 = 0$, for chambered airfoils $\alpha_0 &lt; 0$. </p>

<p>I don't know what that angle is for the A320, it will be difficult to obtain. Let's assume for now it is -1.2 degrees. </p>

<p>For infinite long wings in incompressible flow the lift slope $\frac{\textrm{d}C_L}{\textrm{d}\alpha}$ is $2\pi$. </p>

<p>$(\alpha-\alpha_0) = \frac{C_L}{2\pi} =0.0474 \textrm{ rad} \approx 2.72^\circ$</p>

<p>This would result in an angle of attack of $\alpha \approx 1.52^\circ$</p>

<p>Because the wing of the Airbus A320 is not infinitely long but has a span of about 30 meters (excluding the fuselage) we need to correct for that. The reason we need to correct for the finiteness of the wing is that the circulation will cause the local angle of attack of the wing to be lower than the free stream angle of attack. The effective angle of attack $\alpha_{eff} = \alpha - \alpha _i$</p>

<p>The induced angle of attack $\alpha_i$ is given by:</p>

<p>$\alpha_i = \frac{C_L}{\pi AR} = \frac{C_LS}{\pi b^2}$</p>

<p>substitute: 
$   
S = 122.6 \textrm{ m}^2\\b = 30 \textrm{ m}
$</p>

<p>gives $\alpha_i = 0.0129 \textrm{ rad} \approx 0.74^\circ$</p>

<p>Adding this to our earlier angle of attack results in:</p>

<p>$ 1.52 + 0.74 = 2.26^\circ$</p>

<p>This may not be very accurate as </p>

<p>a) the zero-lift angle of attack may be very different, </p>

<p>b) the lift slope may be flatter due to compressibility effects</p>

<li><p>Better thrust to weight ratio- 6:1 in Trent 1000 Vs 9:1 F119 (used in F-22 Raptor)- Even if the actual thrust produced by the low bypass turbofans is lesser, they produce more thrust per kg of engine, which means that the engine can be more compact in size.</p></li>
<li><p>The low bypass turbofans are more efficient at higher speeds compared to the high bypass turbofans.</p></li>

However, now that fuel is by far the main expense in an airliner's trip, companies are looking for any way to reduce fuel burn. As it turns out, taxiing an airliner burns quite a bit of fuel. They've already started turning one engine off for long taxis, and I think that electric wheel motors will be the next big thing.</p>

<p>The motors have gotten light enough and strong enough that they are a now a viable option. They can be powered by the APU or by a set of batteries (which are also now becoming light enough, see the 787 when they get the kinks worked out). So when they get around to putting them on aircraft for taxiing purposes, you can bet that they'll be spun-up right before landing.</p>

"How do commercial pilots send distress signals?","10631","","<p>If a commercial jet is in trouble, how does a pilot send a signal indicating distress? Does it take long?</p>

<p>For instance, behind reception desks in many institutions and executive offices, there's a hidden red button that, when pressed, calls security or the police. (I know this since I sit at such a desk.) Do commercial airliners have a similar switch, or do they need to radio in for help? What happens when such a transmission is received?</p>
","<p>There are three common ways to send a distress signal (roughly in order of preference):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Over the radio, to whoever you are currently talking to.</strong><br>
Key the microphone and announce to the world <code>Mayday, Mayday, Mayday</code>, the flight's callsign, and a description of the emergency. This is generally the way an emergency is declared, particularly for commercial (airline) service, as they're generally always in contact with an ATC facility</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Over the radio, to anyone monitoring the ""emergency"" frequency.</strong><br>
The VHF frequency 121.5MHz is reserved for aircraft emergency communication. It is monitored at most air traffic control facilities, as well as by many airliners and other pilots with multiple radios in their aircraft. If you're not able to make contact with the facility you're currently talking to in (1) above (or if you're not currently talking to an ATC facility).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using the aircraft's transponder.</strong><br>
Three transponder codes are reserved for unusual/emergency situations:<br>
<code>7700</code> for general emergencies<br>
<code>7600</code> for loss of communication (radio failure)<br>
<code>7500</code> for hijacking or other unlawful interference<br>
All of these transponder codes alter the way the aircraft's radar target is displayed, to alert the controller to the possible problem (exactly <em>how</em> the display is modified depends on the radar equipment the controller has, and can range from additional text in the data block, like <code>RDOF</code> (RaDiO Failure) for code <code>7600</code> to changing the color of the displayed block on newer systems.<br>
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/2164/64"">Bret detailed some of the procedures around these codes in his answer</a>, and more information is available <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0502.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from the FAA</a>, though you'll have to dig through a few referenced documents to put it all together.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that sometimes the order of preference changes - For example if a pilot is being threatened by a hijacker they may quietly set their transponder code to 7500 <em>without</em> saying anything on the radio to alert the hijacker.</p>

"Can the landing gear be pulled up while the plane is on the ground?","10627","","<p>If a pilot makes a mistake and inadvertently touches the gear up lever, will it actually activate while on the ground and make the plane drop onto its belly?</p>

<p>I suppose that there would be some sensor to prevent this, but I would like clarification on that.</p>
","<p>There is a weight sensor which senses if the plane is on the ground. This sensor prevents gear retraction while the plane is still on the ground. Failure of this sensor would prevent gear retraction after takeoff.</p>

<p>If you note closely, the landing gears (even the non-retractable ones) are not connected using a simple metal pole; rather, there is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleo_strut"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an oleo strut</a> which is compressed by the weight of the aircraft. Besides airborne / ground detection, the struts absorb the vertical energy during touchdown.</p>

<hr>

<p>Landing gear stories cannot be complete without mentioning this incident in 1990:</p>

<p>A training captain of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_340"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Saab 340</a> was betting with his students that the weight-on-gear mechanism would prevent gear retraction while on the ground. On the accident airplane type, the mechanism would lock the gear handle, but the lock can be overridden if the pilot manually pull out and move the handle. The instructor confidently pulled out the handle and to his surprise, the hydraulics started to move and the gears were retracted while the plane was still on the ground.</p>

"Are pilots allowed to let passengers fly the plane?","10610","","<p>Is a private pilot license holder in the USA who is giving a scenic tour with friends allowed to let them fly the plane? Are there any restrictions on when this can be done?</p>

<p>In my mind, this could be done safely while at altitude and the pilot could let them do a few shallow turns.  They wouldn't want them doing anything complex and would want them to instantly let go if asked.</p>
","<p>For a non-commercial flight under Part 91 rules there are no issues I'm aware of with letting a non-rated passenger handle the controls - and it's done quite frequently (I can't think of any pilots I know offhand who <em>haven't</em> had someone else take the controls for one reason or another).  </p>

<p>The rated pilot is still pilot-in-command of the flight and ultimately responsible for everything that happens, so they need to be relatively certain their friend will let go of the controls if told to do so, and they need to maintain situational awareness (traffic scan, airspace, etc. -- if the friend blunders into Class B airspace it's going to land in the pilot's lap) and be ready to take over if the friend starts doing something that could jeopardize the safety of the flight.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are some common-sense limits here: something insane like have two non-rated friends at the controls the rated pilot being PIC from the back seat giving them instructions over the intercom would be a no-go.<br>
Similarly while this sort of thing is a total non-event in an aircraft with typical dual controls you would probably want to have a higher level of trust in your friend if you're flying something with a throw-over yoke.</p>

","<p>In the light aircraft world there are a few trade-offs to consider.  The short version:</p>

<p><strong>Single-Engine Pros:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity<br>
One engine means fewer controls, a simpler fuel system, simpler vacuum system, simpler electrical system, etc.</li>
<li>Operational cost<br>
Only one engine to feed, so you spend less on - fuel &amp; oil per flight.</li>
<li>Maintenance cost<br>
Only one engine to maintain - One set of spark plugs &amp; cylinders, One engine to overhaul.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Single-Engine Cons:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>No redundancy: You have one engine, if it fails you're a glider.</li>
<li>Singles generally tend to have less spacious cabins than twins.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Twin-Engine pros:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Redundancy<br>
If you lose an engine the other will give you a chance to get to a landing site.</li>
<li>Cabin space<br>
If you step up beyond ""twin trainers"" you can get a very nice cabin in a piston twin.</li>
<li>Equipment<br>
Again, if you step up beyond the ""twin trainers"" twin-engine planes tend to be ""traveling aircraft"", so they often come with nice features like deice/anti-ice equipment.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Twin-Engine cons:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Operating costs<br>
Two engines to feed (fuel &amp; oil costs double).</li>
<li>Maintenance costs<br>
Two engines mean twice the cylinders, twice the spark plugs, etc.</li>
<li>Complexity<br>
The redundancy you can get in a twin comes at a price: Synchronizing the propellers, a more complex fuel system (crossfeed), paralleling alternators, vacuum system failover, etc.</li>
<li>Short and Soft field performance can be lacking.</li>
<li>Failure of an engine <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_engine"">can be problematic</a>. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>In addition to the operational considerations there are some other practical items to consider: twin-engine aircraft require a multi-engine rating (which means more training time). Twins will also generally be more expensive to purchase/rent (and may be more difficult to rent when away from home), and will likely cost more to insure (particularly for low-time pilots).</p>

"Can jet airplanes operate on 'rough' airfields?","10562","","<p>A question I've always wondered is: can jet aircraft - not turboprop in this case - operate from 'rough' airstrips. My definition of 'rough' is grass or maybe a smooth mud airfield. I know that there's the dry lake at Edwards AFB that is used by aircraft for testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are aircraft such as the Boeing/ Airbus passengers series - 737, 777, 747 etc - designed for or have the capability to regularly handle these airfields?</li>
<li>Are there currently any operators using these kinds of fields?</li>
</ul>

<p>I can understand that tarmac/ concrete makes for a much smoother and more pleasant surface along with the reduce risk of FOD, hidden cracks that wheels could get caught in etc.</p>

<p>Any other examples such as executive jets, fighter aircraft that regularly handle rough fields are more than welcome.</p>
","<p>The main problem with most jet airliners is that the engines are placed close to the ground. If the field is not paved, this increases the risk of damage to the engines from ingesting FOD (foreign object debris).</p>

<p>There are, however, jets that can operate from un-paved fields.</p>

<p>The 737-200 has an option called a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravelkit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gravel kit</a>."" Despite having engines close to the ground, this kit helps to prevent the engine from sucking in FOD, which allows the aircraft to operate off of gravel runways. It also includes an addition to the nose gear to help prevent gravel from getting kicked up. For this reason, airlines like Canadian North still operate multiple 737-200 aircraft in order to provide service to airports with gravel runways.</p>

<p>High-wing aircraft are better suited for this type of mission (see <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/701/pros-and-cons-of-high-wing-vs-low-wing-design"">What are the pros and cons of high-wing compared to low-wing design?</a>).

The IL-76 is a Russian aircraft of a similar configuration that also operates out of unpaved fields.</p>

<p>Aircraft with engines mounted on the rear fuselage also protect the engines from ingesting FOD.

"What is ""detonation"" in a piston engine?","10557","","<p>Recently, I saw <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/14033/3170"">this question</a>, which included a rather alarming quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Full throttle operation with carburetor heat on can cause detonation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woah! That doesn't sound good. In fact, I would have figured aviation engine manufacturers would have worked hard to prevent their engines from exploding, and possibly destroying the rest of the aircraft and/or killing the pilot in the process.</p>

<p>I also found <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/2141/3170"">this question</a>, with a rather calm quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if I have a noise cancelling headset on, and the engine undergoes detonation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like there should be other cues that your engine just blew itself to bits...</p>

<p>I'm figuring that perhaps ""detonation"" in this context doesn't <em>actually</em> mean that your engine block turns into shrapnel. I also figure that it doesn't refer to the normal process of piston engines, where fuel is injected and mixed with fuel before detonating. So what <em>does</em> it mean?</p>
","<p>Detonation, as the name suggests, is an explosion of the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder. Under normal operation, the spark plugs each ignite a point in the fuel/air charge, which then propagate through the cylinder and provides a consistent, regulated burn in a process called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflagration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deflagration</a>. This extends the time that the burning fuel pushes on the cylinder, providing a gentle power stroke.</p>

<p>During detonation, the fuel/air charge (or pockets within the charge) explodes rather than burning smoothly. Because of this explosion, the charge exerts a much higher force on the piston and cylinder, leading to increased noise, vibration, and cylinder head temperatures. The violence of detonation also causes a reduction in power. Mild detonation may increase engine wear, though some engines can operate with mild detonation regularly. However, severe detonation can cause engine failure in minutes. Because of the noise that it makes, detonation is called ""engine knock"" or ""pinging"" in cars.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bkkpm.png"" alt=""Visualization of Detonation. Source: FAA PHAK, page 6-18""><br/>

<p>Detonation can be caused by a number of factors, but generally they relate to a situation outside of the engine's design. Using the wrong fuel can cause detonation: the octane rating of a fuel is basically the amount of pressure it can take before it detonates. Similarly, high cylinder temperatures can cause detonation(1). This is why mixture is set very rich when at high power levels: the excess fuel cools the cylinders, preventing detonation. As noted above, full power with carburetor heat on can cause detonation, as the increased temperature mimics the effect of high cylinder temperatures. Full carburetor heat is required to provide at least a 90 degree F increase in intake air temperature.</p>

</ul>

<p>1) Detonation is distinct from pre-ignition, where the fuel/air charge is ignited by something other than the spark plug. Notably, detonation and pre-ignition often cause each other, as a detonating engine will have a very high CHT (potentially enough to cause pre-ignition), and if the charge pre-ignites as the cylinder is still rising, the continued compression may cause the charge to detonate.</p>

<p>I've read stories in the internets that civil pilots allegedly can make their planes invisible for the flight controllers by turning off some device (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder"" rel=""noreferrer"">transponder</a>?). I'm not sure if it is true, but I saw with my own eyes a pilot of a small aircraft (Cessna Skyhawk), who took off without a transponder (the antenna was broken), was told by the ATC to fix the transponder, landed, and then took off again -- now with a temporary fix that made the antenna work for a while. In other words: Pilots of small aircraft do have the option to fly with or without a transponder (at least on small Austrian airfields). I'm not sure if it's 100 % legal, but sometimes pilots do it.</p>

<p>But a military Eurofighter is different from a little Cessna plane.</p>

<p>Is it technically possible for a pilot of Eurofighter Typhoon to become invisible for the air traffic controllers by switching off the transponder?</p>
","<p>Radar systems have 2 aspects, the primary and secondary systems, or the Radar and the interrogator. The radar sends out a RF signal and receives everything that is returned on that same frequency, and performs calculations to determine the azimuth and range of everything it receives. The interrogator sends out radio pulses which transponders in aircraft receive and decode. The transponders then transmit data on a different frequency than what was received. The interrogator then receives that signal and decodes it and correlates it with the primary radar data to tell the operator that 'yes, that is definitely a valid target' and gives the info on the flight to the operator.</p>

<p>You can turn off the transponder, but all that will do is make it so that the ATC won't be able to see a correlated flight, (one that is definitely an aircraft and not just noise coming through the primary radar). The screen would still show a blip where the radar picks up a signature though. If the plane has radar absorbent material or is close enough to the ground, that would get filtered out as noise.</p>

<p>An ATC, who is used to only working with aircraft who want to be seen, and thus keep their transponders on, might be fooled by this. But a military radar operator might not be so easily fooled by this. </p>

<p>Most aircrafts use winglets to improve performance. Basically, they reduce the wingtip vortex by [deflecting the air](and the associated drag by deflecting the air that wants to escape over the tip back down) that wants to escape over the tip back down. This reduces the induced drag.</p>

"Why did the Junkers Ju-52 have corrugated external surfaces?","10464","","<p>Every time I pass by Munich I have to pay a visit to the Deutsches museum, in particular to the aviation wing.</p>

<p>Among the other aircraft on display, there is a <a href=""http://www.deutsches-museum.de/sammlungen/verkehr/luftfahrt/propellerflugzeuge/ab-1918-bis-1945/junkers-ju-52/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Junkers Ju-52</a>. A different photo taken from <a href=""http://wellisntthisabitglorious.com/?attachment_id=308"" rel=""noreferrer"">a different website</a> illustrates well what caught my attention:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMlGT.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMlGT.jpg"" alt=""Lufthansa Ju-52""></a></p>

<p>Why are the external surfaces of both wing and fuselage corrugated?
Were the designers hoping to achieve some performance improvement through this choice? Are there any papers/documents about this?</p>
","<p>It was largely a structural decision. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Trimotor"">Ford Tri-Motor</a> which was designed to mimic many things the Junkers plane designs included, including the corrugated metal. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...all of which were constructed of aluminum alloy, which was corrugated for added stiffness, although the resulting drag reduced its overall performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corrugated metal is common for roof panels and ironically, hangars, these days. You can find some info on the strength and flex properties of it when related to those topics. Here is an <a href=""http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=394085"">interesting thread</a> on increased drag (and load) on corrugated roofs. </p>

<p>As for the availability of the material vs sheet aluminum I would argue that it had little effect on the design choice. Keep in mind all corrugated aluminum starts out as sheet aluminum at some point in the line so its hard to say there is more than one or either material. On top of that it takes more corrugated material to cover a specific square area than flat sheet material which would drive the price up. At that time period in aviation a lot of experimenting was going on and anything that made a plane a bit stronger or a bit faster was considered quite an achievement. Keep in mind we are coming of the tails of the fabric plane era so a design like this would have seemed revolutionary. The Ju-52/3m (the one you have pictured) came out in 1932 (work began in '28), by that time other makers were already looking at and working on smooth aluminum body planes. There is of course a large social aspect to the availability of materials at this time in history especially in Germany. I will refrain form a full history lesson here but you can read up on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers"">Junkers history here</a> and about the man him self <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Junkers"">Hugo Junkers here</a> which include some of his political views and his involvement (and issues with) the Nazi party. His work in all metal designs is credited with inspiring many passenger planes in the post WW1 and WW2 eras of design.      </p>

If I'm really good at just learning from a book, can I just learn that way, maybe take a couple practice tests and then take the exam?  Or are they going to need proof that I went to some certified class?</p>

<p>More subjectively: Assuming it's allowable, is it a bad idea?</p>
","<p>In Canada, you are required to have 40 hours of ground school instruction. See <a href=""http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part4-standards-421-1086.htm"">Canadian Aviation Regulations 421.26 (3)(a)</a>:</p>

<p>Because in both cases an instructor must sign off on your preparedness for the examination, and passing the examination demonstrates that you meet the standard, in my opinion, the only thing that would make self-study a bad idea is if self-study is not an effective learning method for you, which could delay your training.</p>

"How do Ram Air Turbines get deployed?","10423","","<p>I understand that most larger jets have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_air_turbine"">Ram Air Turbine (RAT)</a> in case of total electrical failure (for instance, when you <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider"">run out of fuel</a>) in order to at least have some hydraulics and a couple of instruments. The RAT gets deployed automatically at the loss of electrical systems.</p>

<p>But how does it get deployed? I'm interested in the triggering mechanism, as, during a complete electrical failure, there can be no electrical trigger (computer or otherwise). So it must be something mechanical. Or are they relying on batteries?</p>

<p>I figured it'd have to be some failsafe mechanism, like stored (hydraulic or otherwise) pressure held back by something like an electromagnet or hydraulic pressure, cut the power and presto, the RAT deploys. However, I've never seen one deployed on an aircraft sitting on the ground with the power off, so that kind of shot down that idea.</p>
","<p>The RAT is automatically deployed on many aircraft, including the CRJ and A320 series, but it can be manually released as well. In between the loss of power and the RAT spins up you have the batteries to fall back to which are normally fully charged.</p>

<p>The <strong>Airbus Manual</strong> has the following comment on the APU:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case of total loss of all main generators, the RAT is automatically
  extended and drives the emergency generator via a hydraulic motor. The
  EMER GEN supplies the AC ESS BUS and the DC ESS BUS via the ESS TR.
  The ECAM WD remains powered, with associated procedures presented.
  Alternate law is operative through ELAC 1 and SEC 1</p>

</blockquote>

<p>While this is for the <strong>CRJ</strong>, who call it an Air Driven Generator (ADG):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the event of a complete AC power failure in flight, the ADG will
  automatically deploy and supply emergency AC power to the ADG bus and
  to the AC essential bus. If the automatic deploy function fails, the
  ADG can be deployed manually by pulling the ADG manual release handle
  on the ADG CONTROL control panel at the rear of the center console.</p>

<p>I think most if not all are spring loaded, and have a little help from gravity on the way. You'll also notice that many are stored to be pushed into place by the jetstream. </p>

<p>Have a look at this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67pBrUVPAO8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> below around 0:20. The slow upwards motion suggests that it's having to reload the spring energy at 1:20. The doors are attached mechanically.</p>

<p>As can be seen, there's a hierarchy to electrical power use, and the battery feeds the essential busses, where the RAT deployment would be included. If I'm not mistaken, power is very limited: You loose some of the more fancy control computers along with the non-necessary stuff, like the copilot's displays, as can be seen in the following <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djd7f_azfiI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a>.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that some aircraft, such as the 747 (up to -400), do not have a RAT on the aircraft, and rely on the windmilling engines to provide sufficient hydraulics to control the aircraft, and as such there's no deployment of sorts necessary.</p>

"Why are there no blended-wing passenger airplanes in operation?","10362","","<p>Blended wings are more beneficial when it comes to fuel efficiency increase and noise reduction. However, no manufacturer has decided to produce these airplanes for major airline operation so far. What are the inhibiting factors in the industry for not using this configuration?</p>

<p>From what I can guess:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a complete new configuration with low experience on it. High risk.</li>
<li>Aircraft will be in VLA sector (>500 passengers), a sector not very attractive nowadays.</li>
<li>The 90 seconds evacuation limit needs to be observed.</li>
</ul>
","<p>All studies which so far showed an advantage for blended-wing bodies (BWB) were flawed.</p>

<p>The trick mostly used is to compare an existing airliner with a hypothetical BWB which uses equally hypothetical engines of improved efficiency, like what could be expected 20 years into the future. This masks the inefficiency of the BWB concept and makes the combination come out ahead.</p>

<p>The BWB will always have more surface area than a comparable conventional design. This translates into more friction drag and more skin mass, which more than offsets any advantage given by the bigger wing root (which helps to reduce wing spar mass). If you like real data, use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Vulcan"">Avro Vulcan</a> as an early BWB and compare it to its contemporaries. Note that design attempts for an airliner based on the Vulcan (<a href=""http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread212956/pg1"">type 722 Atlantic</a>) went nowhere.</p>

<p>Why are these BWB studies published? The author gets more attention when he/she claims a ""revolutionary breakthrough"" than when he/she is more honest and admits that the concept is a dud. Even Boeing or Airbus like to publish BWB studies, so the public gets the impression they are ahead of the competition. It is sickening to read such academically dishonest studies - you need to spend time to dig to the bottom of the thing and to unravel the plot; however, once you have done this a few times, they all become alike. But compared to studies made 60 or 80 years ago, where the author factually lists what he did and why it didn't work out (which is the only way you can learn something), those modern studies are a waste of time.</p>

"Why do passenger jets accept input that will cause the aircraft to perform dangerous maneuvers it was not designed for?","10340","","<p>Examples: </p>

<ul>
<li>A bank angle > 45 degrees is considered an “upset,” putting the plane in a position that can lead to a loss of control.</li>
<li>A pitch > 20 degrees can possibly be dangerous and cause the aircraft to stall (depends on many factors or course).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few examples of limits that most passenger jets have. Now why is it that the plane actually accepts input that will cause the aircraft to go beyond these limits? What possibly use could “diving” straight towards the ground or towards the sky have? Or having a high bank angle that will almost certainly cause stalling and loss of control?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, pilots don't like it when a computer interprets or limits their actions. They want final control. They don't always get their way on this but that's their preference.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, Boeing tends to stick with the philosophy that ""the pilot is the final arbiter."" Airbus is more likely to preempt pilot inputs and modify them.</p>

<p>Although the majority of crashes and incidents wind up being pilot error, there is a serious flaw to modifying pilot inputs. That flaw is in the case of systems failure.</p>

<p>By definition, failure modes involve things going wrong.  When things go wrong it's effectively impossible to plan, in automation, for all contingencies. People are much better at responding to the unknown than automation systems are.</p>

<p>Take for instance the rule that ""bank angles > 45 degrees are dangerous, and are therefore prohibited"". How does the plane know that the bank angle is > 45 degrees? Well it's a sensor of course, but what if the sensor has failed? A failed sensor will either signal to take action when none is needed or fail to signal when action is called for. What if the control surfaces have failed and the plane cannot correct the bank angle?</p>

<p>The usual answer to that is redundant systems, high reliability parts and design, etc.  All those are great of course and certainly help a lot. However we still have incidents and accidents.</p>

<p>In the end the question is: Who do you trust more? A pilot or a machine? And statistics and science only help you part-way here. A person's experience, biases and feelings will have a lot to say about how they answer. And by ""person"", understand that I'm including the customers, the paying public.</p>

  <p>Prior to departure (usually before engine startup), all the aircraft doors are placed into the armed (or automatic) mode by the cabin crew.

<p>This is also the reason for the famous <a href=""http://www.askthepilot.com/how-to-speak-airline/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>All doors in flight</em> announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DOORS TO ARRIVAL AND CROSSCHECK “Flight attendants, doors to arrival and crosscheck.”</p>
  
  <p>Meaning: Occasionally heard as “disarm your doors and crosscheck,” and announced by the lead flight attendant or purser as a plane approaches the gate. The intent is to verify disarming of the emergency escape slides attached to the doors. When armed, a slide will automatically deploy the instant its door is opened. Disarmed, it needs to be deployed manually. On departure the slides are armed to facilitate an emergency evacuation. (You might hear this as “doors to automatic.”) Upon docking, they’re disarmed to keep them from billowing into the boarding tunnel or onto the apron during servicing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The orange or yellow tape is a visual indicator for ground workers or ramp agents that the doors are armed or not armed. The visual indicator can vary, it can also be built into the door lock mechanism, triggering a visual indicator externally if the door is locked and armed. In the following picture, the orange tape is not strapped over the window, which should indicate an unarmed door. In the video that this image is taken from, the flight attendant has just locked and possibly armed the door, the other flight attendant would place the orange tape over the door window during ""cross-check"".</p>

","<p>Based on its fixed-wing hypersonic design and inordinately high wing loading, I would predict that the X-15 has the highest recommend landing speed of any earthbound aircraft, with a preliminary search seemingly bearing this hypothesis out. According to an ostensibly legitimate NASA source (link below), the X-15's normal landing speed was 200+mph (173.8kts=321.9kph),</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html</a></p>

<p>But if unofficial sources are to be believed, its actual landing speed was much higher, closer to 390kph=208kts (although these numbers are admittedly more dubious):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“According to an early edition of 'the Guinness book of world records' the X15 also holds the record for fastest landing speed at 242 mph compared with 210 mph for the space shuttle.”</p>

<p>If only powered aircraft are open to consideration, then the F-104 Starfighter would have to be up there as well. It needed a blown-flap flow control system just to be sane during landing...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To make landing speeds “reasonable,” The F-104 forced engine air through the wings to smooth the airflow and give more lift. With bleed air, the Zipper could land at the challenging but not extreme speed of 160 to 165 knots. If the air-bleed system was not working, landing speeds climbed to 240 knots.”</p>

<p>So, if mechanical failure scenarios are deemed admissible, then the F-104 without its crucial boundary layer control systems would be the clear winner for powered landing speed, weighing in at an absolutely terrifying 240 kts. Otherwise, it would appear that the X-15 (unofficially) reigns supreme.</p>

"How do wings generate lift?","10257","","<p>Just the basic question that every aviation enthusiast must be curious about: exactly how does a wing generate lift?</p>
","<p>To get to the bottom of it, it might help to look at lift at a molecular level:</p>

<p>Every air molecule is in a dynamic equilibrium between inertial, pressure and viscous effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inertial means that the mass of the particle wants to travel on as before and needs force to be convinced otherwise.</li>
<li>Pressure means that air particles oscillate all the time and bounce into other air particles. The more bouncing, the more force they exert on their surroundings.</li>
<li>Viscosity means that air molecules, because of this oscillation, tend to assume the speed and direction of their neighbors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flow over the upper side of the wing</h2>

<p>Now to the airflow: When a wing approaches at subsonic speed, the low pressure area over its upper surface will suck in air ahead of it. See it this way: Above and downstream of a packet of air we have less bouncing of molecules (= less pressure), and now the undiminished bouncing of the air below and upstream of that packet will push its air molecules upwards and towards that wing. The packet of air will rise and accelerate towards the wing and be sucked into that low pressure area. Due to the acceleration, the packet will be stretched lengthwise and its pressure drops in sync with it picking up speed. Spreading happens in flow direction - the packet is distorted and stretched lengthwise, but contracts in the direction orthogonally to the flow. Once there, it will ""see"" that the wing below it curves away from its path of travel, and if that path would remain unchanged, a vacuum between the wing and our packet of air would form. Reluctantly, the packet will change course and follow the wing's contour. This requires even lower pressure, to make the molecules change their direction. This fast-flowing, low-pressure air will in turn suck in new air ahead and below of it, will go on to decelerate and regain its old pressure over the rear half of the wing, and will flow off with its new flow direction.</p>

<p>Note that lift can only happen if the upper contour of the wing will slope downwards and away from the initial path of the air flowing around the wing's leading edge. This could either be camber or angle of attack - both will have the same effect. Since camber allows for a gradual change of the contour, it is more efficient than angle of attack.</p>

<h2>Flow over the lower side of the wing</h2>

<p>A packet of air which ends up below the wing will experience less uplift and acceleration, and in the convex part of highly cambered airfoils it will experience a compression. It also has to change its flow path, because the cambered and/or inclined wing will push the air below it downwards, creating more pressure and more bouncing from above for our packet below the wing. When both packets arrive at the trailing edge, they will have picked up some downward speed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V7Ujo.png"" alt=""Airfoil in wind tunnel with smoke trails indicating flow""></p>

<p>Behind the wing, both packets will continue along their downward path for a while due to inertia and push other air below them down and sideways. Above them, this air, having been pushed sideways before, will now fill the space above our two packets. Macroscopically, this looks like two big vortices. But the air in these vortices cannot act on the wing anymore, so it will not affect drag or lift. See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8877/how-does-an-aircraft-form-wake-turbulence/8882#8882"">here for more on that effect</a>, including pretty pictures.</p>

<h2>Lift can be explained in several, equivalent ways</h2>

<p>Following the picture of a pressure field outlined above, lift is the difference of pressure between upper and lower surface of the wing. The molecules will bounce against the wing skin more at the lower side than at the upper side, and the difference is lift.</p>

<p>Or you look at the macroscopic picture: A certain mass of air has been accelerated downwards by the wing, and this required a force to act on that air. This force is what keeps the aircraft up in the air: Lift.</p>

<p>If you look at the wing as a black box and only pay attention to the impulse of the inflowing and outflowing air, the wing will change the impulse by adding a downward component. The reaction force of this impulse change is lift.</p>

<p>Either way, you will arrive at the same result. By the way: Most of the directional change happens in the forward part of the airfoil, not at the trailing edge!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGhZF.png"" alt=""streamlines around a wing and direction of impulses""></p>

<h2>Lift is a matter of definition</h2>

<p>Lift and induced drag are both part of the pressures acting on the wing. If you add up all the pressure forces acting on a wing, their resulting vector will point slightly backwards. The streamwise component is drag, and the component orthogonal to the direction of movement is lift. This is just a defininion, made for simplicity.</p>

<p>Compared to the standard 777-300, the 777-300ER has:</p>

<ul>
<li>A longer range due to the extra fuel it can carry (145538 kg compared to 135880 kg for the -300 baseline)</li>

","<p>It depends. As always. If thrust is high enough, why not?</p>

<p><a href=""http://flighttraining.aopa.org/magazine/1998/August/199808_Training_Topics_Form_and_Function.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Knife edge flight</a> is a regular part of aerobatic performances, and the fuselage is producing <em>almost</em>* all the needed lift. This requires</p>

<ul>
<li>Enough speed,</li>
<li>A low ratio of aircraft mass to fuselage side area, and</li>
<li>Enough rudder deflection to trim the aircraft in a sufficiently high sidelip angle.</li>
</ul>

<p>For horizontal flight your installed thrust must be sufficient to compensate for the high drag in this attitude. This should be no problem with powerful propeller aircraft if their fuel system keeps them supplied at this attitude. Jets must make sure that the sideslip angle can be tolerated by the intake.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/27SuC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The smoke from the exhaust indicates that this biplane flies horizontally. Yes, it is a large model airplane (not man-carrying, but almost big enough for that). But the laws of physics don't change with scale. For an example of a full-size aircraft doing a knife edge, see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gvUYLA0ucQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video</a>. Thanks go to @romkyns for pointing this out to me!</p>

<p>Note the rudder deflection to keep it at this angle of sideslip. Direction is controlled with the elevator. At this rate of sideslip the propeller thrust contributes to overall lift as well, however, the vertical adds a substantial downforce in order to trim the aircraft and the fuselage has to supply the remaining lift.</p>

<p>* Almost means that the propeller will carry some of the weight, but the large downforce on the vertical needs to be compensated, too. In sum, the lift contributed by the fuselage is very close to the weight of the plane.</p>

"Why would a glider have water ballast?

<blockquote>
  <p>Two water tanks in the wing plus a further 35 liter tank in the
  fuselage enable the ASW 27 B to carry more water ballast than any
  other 15 m glider and also give it the widest range of wing loadings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a glider is trying to stay aloft as long as possible, wouldn't it be better to be light?  Why would you add ballast and be able to dump it?</p>
","<p><em>Mass doesn't affect the maximum distance, only the maximum endurance.</em></p>

<p>For example, image two identical planes A and B: A weights 50kg less than B. Assuming no wind (horizontal / vertical) and speed of best glide, both gliders will land at the exact same spot.</p>

<p>The lighter airplane A however will arrive later than B, as the speed of best glide is less than for B. In conclusion you can say, that additional mass only increases cruise speed, but not the travel distance.</p>

<p>Glider competitions are most of the time a route you have to fly in the shortest time possible. So that means, if you have a higher speed of best glide, you can fly faster in competitions.</p>

<p>The only downside to having a higher weight is, that your liftrate in thermals will be decreased and due to the higher speed it is harder to center the thermals.</p>

<p>It is to some extend also possible to shift the Centre of Gravity (CG) with the added load. The further it is to the aft limit, the higher your maximum distance is. This is because you will have less down-force from the stabilizer required. (If the CG is at the front limit, you will need to pull the control stick in order to fly level, therefore you have more drag). However I think this is rather a positive side effect and most of the time the water is used for flying faster. </p>

"How many lives would be saved if the airlines turned all the seats around?","10198","","<p>The psychology and history of forward-facing seats has been answered well already <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11476/why-are-passenger-seats-not-facing-backward-on-an-airplane"">here</a>. I ask instead about <em>how bad it is that seats are forward-facing</em>.</p>

<p>For context, I was looking through Wikipedia's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_flights_that_required_gliding"" rel=""noreferrer"">list of airline flights that required gliding</a>, and a surprising fraction of the 30 incidents listed were fatal to some, but not all, of those aboard (47%). Averaged across the 30 incidents we get that 25.1% of those aboard died (noting that this average is pretty unscientific, and is subject to sampling and coverage biases; it's still interesting). Even among just incidents with fatalities on average less than half of those aboard died! I generated a scatter plot of the incidents:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/88KRH.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/88KRH.png"" alt=""Scatter plot of incidents""></a></p>

<p>This data surprised me a lot! My layman's intuition says that emergency landings should be a lot more bimodal, with basically all landings either being gorgeous US Airways 1549 style happy endings, or blazing fireballs with no survivors, with some very rare exceptions. Based on this intuition, I always figured it was reasonable that passenger seats face forwards; I thought <em>""rear-facing seats wouldn't help that much anyway, edge-cases where it would have made the difference will be the rare exception to the rule""</em>.</p>

<p>But is this really true? It seems that maybe many deaths on commercial flights are incidents in this intermediate region, although I don't have the expertise to evaluate if rear-facing seats would help with how people typically die in commercial airline accidents.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> As a really rough ballpark, how much safer would commercial airline flights be (averaged across all commercial flights globally) if the seats were rear-facing?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""https://www.airspacemag.com/need-to-know/are-aft-facing-airplane-seats-safer-146695292/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evidence</a> is not the most recent one, but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to an article in the December 1952 edition of Naval Aviation News, “Passengers in Navy transport planes have ten-fold better chances of coming out of crashes alive, thanks to backward-facing seats which are being installed in all new planes […]"". The unsigned article cites two Royal Air Force accidents involving a four-engine Hastings and a two-engine Valetta. Both had rear-facing seats that were credited with minimizing injuries to passengers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the link to the 1952 edition ends in a 404. Thanks to the detective work by Gerald Schneider we now have a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20040316130340/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1952/dec52.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">working link</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>An Air Force study in 1957 reviewed a series of crashes and concluded
  that injuries were seven times greater among passengers facing
  forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That a backward-facing seat is safer is indisputable, but quantitative data is very hard to find. Given the much higher wing loadings and landing speeds of modern airliners, possibly those ratios cannot be translated to modern aviation. While in the days of propeller-driven transports the difference between the forward- and backward-facing position might indeed have meant that the latter provided a significant advantage in survivability, the deceleration level in a modern airliner crash might make both equally unsurvivable. In addition, the data from mostly young, fit and healthy subjects involved in crashes of military transports might not translate easily to todays untrained, middle-aged and overweight passengers.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence cited in <a href=""http://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/tc16-31.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this 2016 study</a>, however, indicates that even for modern airliners seating position is important. For an A340 runway overrun accident in Toronto in August 2005 it cites the Canadian TSB as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘One of the cabin crew, seated in the same general area as the crew
  and passengers who incurred serious impact injuries, was not injured.
  This cabin crew’s seat was aft-facing; the other seats were
  forward-facing.’</p>

"What is ""Hotel Mode"" on a turboprop engine?","10170","","<p>I have heard that some aircraft that do not have an APU can run an engine in ""Hotel Mode"".</p>

<p>What is hotel mode? Are there any advantages to having it instead of an APU?</p>
","<p><strong>Hotel mode</strong> is a feature on ATR 42/72 turboprops replacing an APU by locking the right-hand #2 engine (PW100) with a 'propeller brake' while allowing the turbine, and therefore also the generator, to run, providing electrical power and bleed air.</p>

<p>ATR describes this as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The propeller brake is fitted on a countershaft on the RH engine reduction gearbox in order to stop the propeller (and the power turbine)</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>HP (High Pressure) spool drives the DC generator.</p></li>
  <li><p>Bleed pressure is available downstream the HP compressor and supplies both packs.</p></li>

<p>Hotel Mode seems to be generally disliked for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's very loud, especially if you're lifting baggage next to it</li>
<li>It consumes a lot of fuel, since you're running a full engine.</li>
<li>It could be dangerous if the propeller brake is in poor condition and suddenly loses its grip.</li>
</ul>

<p>This configuration is rare, if not unique. The rival Dash-8 has a separate APU, as does the Saab 2000. It was an optional feature on the Fokker 50. The smaller Jetstream 41 only has a battery.</p>

I am moving into a position to get back in the air, but I no longer have my log book as it was lost between moves. What is the best way to move forward? </p>
","<p>The best approach is to start a new logbook with totals that carry over from your latest FAA 8710 - in this case, it sounds like you will roll back to the hours from when you earned your private pilot certificate.

<p>You can request a copy of your 8710 from the FAA, which I'm gonna quote here because that's the best way to not screw anything up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Airmen who have lost their logbooks or flight records may request copies of their files from the FAA [by sending <strong><em><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/airmen_certification/media/COMPRQST.pdf"">this form</a></em></strong>] to the following:</p>

<p>Once you receive the copy, the first line in your new logbook should probably summarize all the totals from the 8710 (just like if it was a flight). The remarks would specify ""time forward from 8710 dated DD/MM/YYY"" or something to that effect.</p>

"How does a fighter jet perform good and quick maneuvers with such small wings?","10135","","<p>Fighter jets like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon"">F-16</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle"">F-15</a>, etc. have wings smaller than the length of the fuselage and can perform great maneuvers very quickly while an airliner with a long wingspan takes a lot of time to perform these kind of maneuvers. How does a short wingspan on a fighter jet perform such great maneuvers?</p>
","<p>Fighter (combat) aircraft are <em>designed</em> to perform quick maneuvers in order to get into a position quickly to engage and shoot down an enemy aircraft or evade incoming threats (like missiles, etc.). Civil aircraft like airliners are designed with other things in mind like comfort, safety, reduced fuel consumption, etc.</p>

<p>The wings are only a part of the story in performing maneuvers like those performed in air combat maneuvering, which depends on a number of aircraft characteristics like,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Power</strong> - For carrying out most of the maneuvers (like wingover), the excess power available matters. Fighter aircraft have more excess power, which translates into more acceleration. That allows it it enter into maneuvers quickly compared to the civil aircraft. In case of emergencies, the combat aircraft can use their afterburners to gain significant extra power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thrust-to-Weight Ratio</strong> - Most of the modern fighters have high <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust-to-weight_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thrust-to-weight</a> ratios, usually more than 1 (which allows them to accelerate in vertical climb). This allows the fighters to accelerate far faster compared to the civil aircraft. For example, F-15 (>1) had a thrust-to-weight ratio more the three times that of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Concorde</a> (~0.33).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Source: strategypage.com</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stability</strong> Most of the fighter aircraft today are designed to be unstable. This makes the aircraft respond to control inputs much more quickly compared to the airliners (which are usually not unstable in the roll axis). This means that the combat aircraft are capable of maneuvering much more quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inertia</strong> In case of large wings, the roll inertia is very high. This prevents them from performing quick maneuvers. Also, the damping of the large wings is also to be considered. In case of fighters, however, the short wings, having smaller inertia helps in achieving high roll rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wing Loading</strong> The smaller the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_loading"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wing loading</a>, the better the turn performance. Most of the combat aircraft employ a blended wing-fuselage design, that reduces the load on the wings. For example, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eurofighter Typhoon</a> (~300&nbsp;kg/$m^{2}$) has about half the wing loading of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A380</a> (>600&nbsp;kg/$m^{2}$). In fact, an F-15 produced enough lift <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Negev_mid-air_collision"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">with half a wing gone</a> to perform a successful landing.</p></li>

<p>Source:www.armchairgeneral.com</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Control Surfaces</strong>- In general, the combat aircraft have more number of control surfaces like canards (in addition to primary control surfaces) compared to the civil aircraft. This enables the pilot to maneuver the aircraft much more quickly compared to airliners.</li>
</ul>

"Do fighter jet pilots ever use autopilot?","10122","","<p>I know that military jets have autopilot, but do the pilots actually prefer to use it?</p>

<p>I ask this question because, unlike civilian airplanes, military jets are more likely to come in a situation where the pilot may have to take quick decision and leave the designated path for some mission (e.g. to intercept a civilian jet flying on a wrong path). In such case, the autopilot may become a problem for quick maneuvering.</p>
","<p>I'm not in the military, so you could say I'm talking out my rear end here, but based on my experience as a pilot: <strong>yes, military pilots use the autopilot all the time</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's my reasoning, in order of most to least convincing evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Punching the autopilot off takes <em>about a fifth of a second</em>.  The button is right there on the yoke, for crying out loud.  The time it takes to turn it off is not a good reason not to have it on.</p></li>
<li><p>The autopilot is a labor-saving device.  When you're in an aircraft (and <em>particularly</em> when you're solo in one) there are times when you'd rather be paying attention to your chart or setting up the FMS or stretching or eating a candy bar instead of actually flying the plane. Also, when Air Force pilots fly long repositoning flights, the autopilot reduces fatigue between in-flight refuelings (the Navy uses carriers).</p></li>
<li><p>Times when you might have to leave the designated path for a mission happen a lot less than you think.  Again, not in the military, I'm just basing this on the realities of fuel and the number of military aircraft out there.  Maybe if you're flying close air support for teams on the ground or something, but remember that the military is first and foremost a logistics organization - it's a machine for moving people and things from one place to another.  Most of the time, military aircraft aren't on a hair-trigger moment's notice ready-to-engage posture, they're going from one airfield to another for training or maintenance or something.</p></li>
<li><p>In most aircraft, you can override the autopilot if you need to anyway.  Again, never flown a military fighter aircraft, but based on what I know about flying in general, even if you're chilling in your F-22 (with the autopilot on) if you grab the stick and yank, the airplane will move.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQJqC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>As far as I know, the inboard ailerons are used for high speed maneuvering.
The rolling moment induced by the ailerons is linearly dependent with the distance to the center of gravity (e.g. the farther out, the stronger the moment, the harder the roll).
As the aileron is an aerodynamic surface, the force induces is equal to:
$$F_{aileron} = c_l(\alpha) \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S_{aileron} $$.
The moment induced is equal to this force, multiplied by the distance to the c.o.g.:
$$M_{aileron} = y_{aileron} \cdot c_l(\alpha) \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S_{aileron} $$
If you're flying in cruise , and you want to make a smooth turn, you need a relatively small $M_{aileron}$.</p>

<p>However, the $V^2$ term, is already very large. So we want to make the rest of the terms relatively small.</p>

<p>We could do this with outboard ailerons: Use the outboard aileron with a large $y_{aileron}$, combined with a small $c_l(\alpha)$, usually the outboard $S_{aileron}$ is fixed by the low speed control requirements.
However, you can provide $M_{aileron}$ more accurate if you use the inboard ailerons (with a small $y _{aileron}$). The smaller distance makes the moment a bit smaller, and less susceptible to small deviations.</p>

<p>I think the Airbus A330 &amp; A340 use their spoilers to maneuver at high speeds. They simply extend their spoilers -which are usually also reasonably close to the c.o.g.- a tiny bit, this changes the lift distribution, also causing a rolling moment. I did not research this fact, so I'm not 100% sure this is the reason the A330 and A340 do not have inboard ailerons, but I do know some aircraft use this method for high speed maneuvering.</p>

"What are these hooks on the A320's wing used for?","10093","","<p>I was flying on an A320 (equipped with sharklets) the other day, and I found these hooks on the wing's surface:</p>

<p>Note that the single hooked attachment is outside the wing's ""DO NOT WALK OUTSIDE THIS AREA"" line. What are these hooks used for? Why is the single hooked attachment outside the ""safe"" walking area line?</p>
","<p>In the event of a water evacuation, there is a line associated with each overwing exit that is extended, and clips to that yellow bracket, as a guide to get everyone out on the wing. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwing_exits#Use_in_a_ditching"">Wikipedia</a>, these are for overwing exits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of overwing exits in a ditching varies from airline to
  airline. On aircraft fitted with overwing exits, there is typically a
  raised escape rope bracket (about a third of the way from the door)
  attached to the wing's upper surface and typically painted yellow.
  This is accompanied by an escape rope found in the frame of the exit
  after opening the hatch. Once this rope is attached to the escape rope
  bracket, it will aid passenger evacuation onto the wing to await
  rescue or to enter the water (depending on the airline's procedures).
  On aircraft with life rafts to be launched via the overwing exit, the
  wing will be used to provide a boarding platform onto the life raft.
  On certain regional aircraft, the overwing exits are the only escape
  route in the event of a ditching.</p>

  instrument experience requirements of part 61 to serve as SIC in
  flight under IFR.  Section 61.57(c) sets out the recent instrument

  instrument approaches within the previous six months.  <em>See</em> Legal

","<p>There is no switch for the FDR, but there is a circuit breaker and by pulling this you are removing aircraft power from the FDR.  However, this does not mean you are necessarily turning it off, as some FDR can be equipped with an internal power supply as a backup to aircraft power.  </p>

<p>is a case of an ""expert"" or journalist confusing the lack of an on/off switch as an inability to turn something off.  As you'll find many examples of in the media, they don't always get it right.

"How do aircraft altimeters calculate altitudes accurately while airborne?","10008","","<p>While an aircraft is airborne, the local barometric pressure can change, causing an altimeter to no longer display the correct altitude. How are altimeters re-calibrated to display the correct altitude, or there are other methods to accomplish that?</p>
","<p>Altimeters are calibrated to a standard atmosphere model (International Standard Atmosphere, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISA</a>). </p>

<p>What the altimeter shows you is the vertical distance between the altitude equivalent to your current pressure (pressure altitude) and a reference ""pressure altitude"". The reference pressure altitude is set in pressure units (hPa or In. Hg) on the altimeter subscale. This is known as the ""altimeter setting"", set in the ""altimeter setting window"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/POu8U.jpg"" alt=""Altimeter""><br>
Image credit: <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/PHAK%20-%20Chapter%2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAA Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge</a></p>

<p>Flying at lower altitudes (below ""transition altitude""), the altimeter is set to airport/regional QNH, which is a pressure calculated so that if you were standing on the measurement point, the altimeter would indicate your exact elevation. At other altitudes, it would approximate altitude above mean sea level, although it would show incorrectly if temperature differed from ISA.</p>

<p>Above transition altitude, the altimeter is set to QNE, or standard pressure (1013.25 hPa, or 29.92 In. Hg). The altimeter will now only indicate correctly if both temperature and pressure are in accordance with ISA. You are now flying on ""flight level"" (where the FL is your QNE indication in hundreds of feet, <em>ie</em> 20,000 ft = FL200).</p>

<p>For the purpose of avoiding obstacles, both QNH and QNE have to be corrected using various methods, which are described in various manuals. (QNH for temperature, QNE for both temperature and pressure, both for other possible factors such as wind etc). For instance, this diagram shows three different aircraft, all flying the same pressure altitude, but with three different true altitudes:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yoYJQ.png"" alt=""Temperature errors""><br>

<p><strong>However</strong>, altitude is also used for the purpose of traffic separation, and for this purpose, neither QNH or QNE is corrected. This might sound counter-intuitive, but as long as your altimeter is showing the same error as any conflicting traffic, you can be safely separated, therefore: <strong>The altitude shown on the altimeter is not corrected at all</strong> (except by calibration for possible aerodynamic interference, such as compressibility, venturi-effects etc).</p>

<p>In technically sophisticated aircraft, barometric altitude input is used for vertical navigation. Since vertical navigation is concerned with the true altitude of the aircraft, the aircrafts Air Data Computer (ADC) will calculated a true altitude based on information available to it (either through sensors, or through pilot input). The true altitude is however, as stated, not shown on the pilots primary flight instruments. </p>

"Why can gliders fly for so long?","9980","","<p>When you throw a paper airplane, it flies for a couple of seconds before losing speed and stalling. With a glider, it has a very long wingspan, but you take off with another plane or winch tow pulling it and then it is released on its own. Shouldn't the glider lose all speed and stall?</p>

","<p>A glider and a paper airplane operate on the same principle: Exchanging whatever potential energy (altitude) they have for the kinetic energy (airspeed) required to keep air moving over the wings so they produce lift, giving a stable, controlled descent (glide).<br>
In both cases <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2903/how-does-stall-depend-on-angle-of-attack-but-not-speed"">the airfoil will not stall unless it exceeds its critical angle of attack</a> which is independent of the airspeed. You can continue to fly (with the wing not stalled and producing lift) as long as you still have altitude to trade for that airspeed, and if you do it right you will eventually run out of both altitude and airspeed fairly close to the ground, where you can have a soft landing at a speed where the aircraft is not damaged. In the case of a manned glider hopefully this happens on a runway where you can get another tow plane to take you up again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Both aircraft can extend their glide time by finding <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(soaring)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other sources of  lift</a> - thermals, ridge lift, etc. - to carry the vehicle to a higher altitude, providing more potential energy.  Gliders are better at this for one major reason: They have a pilot <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1tAOmN4ou8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">who can keep the aircraft in an area of rising air longer</a> to gain the most altitude possible.</p>

<p>A paper aircraft can similarly be made to fly for a longer period of time if given an adequate source of lift (equal to or exceeding its minimum sink rate). There's a rather famous video of the ""infinity paper plane"" which is a paper airplane circling over an electric stovetop, but I'll spoil it for you and tell you that one is a hoax (the general consensus is the plane was on a string).<br>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad1Sjw6bi-k"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one, however, can be replicated fairly easily</a>: The result is more similar to a helicopter in autorotation or an autogyro in a glide than a traditional fixed-wing glider, but it's a good demonstration of the principles involved.</p>

"What is the highest possible thrust generated by 15cm ducted fan?","9961","","<p>I recently developed a sudden interest in flying. I'm wondering whether a pair of small ducted fans could lift a person off the ground. </p>

<p>Lets say the ducted fan is 15cm in diameter. What would be the most thrust a fan like that could produce?</p>
","<p>A 15cm diameter fan could maybe lift 4 KG of mass with a tip speed of 0.6M.</p>

<p>By increasing the power and the blade chord length (in other words, increasing the solidity of the rotor), this may be increased to maybe 6KG or more, but a single fan would probably never lift more than 10KG mass.</p>

<p>The thrust of a rotor is $CT \cdot \rho \cdot Area \cdot tipSpeed^2$. </p>

<ul>
<li>$\rho$ = air density (1.225kg/m^3 at sea level).</li>
<li>$Area$ = area of rotor disc (m^2)</li>
<li>$tipSpeed$ = the linear speed at the tip of the rotor = radial speed * radius.</li>
<li>$CT$ = coefficient of thrust. (is usually in the order of 0.02 to 0.05 for small rotors)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming $CT$ of 0.03, the calculation shows 40N (=4 KG) thrust.</p>

<p>Disc area is one of the most important parameters, even a 30cm disc would generate 4 times the thrust. 60cm would make almost 65 KG. </p>

<p>Apparently, a 50cm diameter disc can possibly generate 45kg thrust on its own. So two of them could carry and maybe even lift-off a person equipped with this backpack (the person + the system must be less than 90 KG).</p>

<li>Most of the UAVs, like Predator can perform (i.e. fly in) some simple missions (like reconnaissance) autonomously.</li>
<li>In case a geostationary satellite is used for communication with the UAV, the latency is around 300 ms (The electromagnetic waves have to travel ~70000 km). In case of other delays (like equipment etc.) this will not be greater than 500 ms or around half a second. This is not significant in case of slow moving systems like Predator (they are not dog-fighting, after all) and the 'pilot' can effectively control the aircraft.</li>

"Can you become a pilot with an Asperger syndrome diagnosis in Europe?","9881","","<p>I have the diagnosis results for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome"">Asperger syndrome</a> (scored 177 out of 76 required to get the diagnosis). Are there any regulations in Europe that can stop me from achieving my life goal: To fly commercial jets?</p>

<p>My autism makes me very strongly interested in aviation, programming and audio design. But aviation is absolutely on top and has been since I was 6. The others have come as I age.</p>

<hr>

<p>It might be a little off-track: So I'll add this little story just to add some ""meat"" to the question:</p>

<p><em>I just recently went on a trip with a few of my co-workers that included a trip on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_Next_Generation#737-800"">B737-800</a>. They thought it was special that I filmed the takeoff and landing, took pictures of it at the gate, and viewed out the window the entire two hours trip (my neck still hurts). They also had a funny reaction when I explained why the airflow to the cabin (packs) suddenly went silent as the engines start up. There is nothing more that I enjoy than flying, and I feel like I really belong up there (that poor kid in the seat in-front of me had a very different opinion).</em></p>

<p><em>I really wanted to see the cockpit during these flights. But asking is hard for me with Asperger. It kind of makes me feel like a 4-year-old.</em></p>

<p><em>It might not count for much in the real world, but I have logged over 16,000 landings on my little home-simulator. Three of them are intended crashes just to test the simulation.</em></p>

<p><em>All I ever wanted since I was a kid was flying commercial jets.</em></p>
","<p>In order to fly commercial you will need a first class medical certificate, and getting that with aspergers is going to be tough. The first consideration is the safety or people in the air and on the ground, so the criteria is conservative. Getting a first class medical would mean lots of extra hoops, even if it is possible. If you did get a medical you would then be competing against candidates who are neuro-typical, and would have to convince the airlines that you would be able to perform your job as well as non-aspergers candidates. That's not to say it's impossible, you would want to talk to a few aviation medical examiners about it to see what they say. If you can get a medical then you've got a chance, and if you are motivated enough and willing to work for it then I believe where there's a will there's a way. </p>

<p>You need to consider your own temperament when going for a pilots license of any kind, whether aspergers or neuro-typical. Flying is not just about the technical details, you need to be able to work with people, first of all your instructor! In commercial flying you also need to cooperate with other pilots and work with passengers, ground crew, and cabin staff. The extreme focus on detail and depth of knowledge on aviation you might develop with aspergers can be a huge asset in some ways, however aspergers could make it very challenging to work cooperatively in the cockpit, deal with troublesome passengers, and make quick and effective decisions. Think about some scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are FO on a flight, the captain makes a decision you do not agree with</li>
<li>A passenger is angry after the flight was delayed and is shouting abuse at you</li>
<li>You are the captain of a flight that is low on fuel and had developed an emergency. You need to very quickly opt for continuing to the destination airport or diverting, and there are problems with either choice</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you think you would be able to successfully deal with these types of situations in the time frame you would have to work with? Not everyone is cut out for that sort of thing, whether aspergers or neuro-typical, these are scenarios all potential commercial pilots would need to be able to deal with. </p>

<p>I think first you should figure out whether you like flying airplanes or not as a love of aviation and airplanes does not automatically mean you will love being at the controls. Why not go for your private license and find out? It's the first step in getting an ATPL anyway, and you could probably get a third class medical. You can then build on that if you want a career in aviation, or keep flying privately if you don't. </p>

"What is the purpose of flutter testing?","9866","","<p>All I am aware of is that flutter testing involves the aircraft shaking violently. How is a flutter test performed and what is its purpose?</p>
","<p>Flutter is a phenomenon that can occur when a structure is subjected to aerodynamic forces. It occurs not only in aircraft but also for example in buildings, power lines, road signs and bridges. Flutter is an oscillation caused by interaction of aerodynamic forces, structural elasticity and inertial effects. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best known example of flutter is the bridge over the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tacoma Narrows ('Gallopin' Gertie')</a>  that collapsed due to flutter in gale force winds. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lRnsi.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Flutter in aircraft causes the wings and / or stabilizers to oscillate. 
When the airspeed increases the energy added in each oscillation to the structure by the aerodynamic forces increases. At some speed the damping of the structure may be insufficient to absorb the energy increase from the aerodynamic loads and the amplitude of the harmonic oscillations will grow until the structure breaks. </p>

<p>A flutter test is performed to determine what speed flutter occurs yet is still damped. Theoretically an aircraft should be able to stay structurally intact up to the design dive speed ($V_d$) which is at least 1.4 times the design cruise speed. In flight tests, the $V_d$ is not always demonstrated as this is very risky since there would not be any margin from breaking up. The maximum speed is slowly increased in subsequent flight tests with careful data analyses in between up to a point where the test team decides that it is no longer safe to continue. This establishes the maximum demonstrated dive speed ($V_{df}$); the published maximum operating speed ($V_{mo}$) and never-exceed speed ($V_{ne}$) are well below $V_{df}$ to give margin from disaster. </p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mbIRXnCSts"" rel=""noreferrer"">video shows flutter</a> in a Hawker 800.

"How is the cabin pressure maintained inside aircraft?","9820","","<p>When aircraft is at high altitude, atmospheric pressure will be too low but inside aircraft pressure is maintained such that it is comfortable for crew and passengers. But how is it maintained?</p>

<p>As I understand that at higher altitude pressure difference can be too large which can deform the plane than how this is handled.</p>
","<p>Once the airplane is closed up, all doors and windows secure, pressurization comes down to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much air is being pumped into the cabin?</li>
<li>how much air is being let out of the cabin?</li>
</ul>

<p>Air enters the cabin (on a jet powered airplane) through bleed air taps in the high pressure compressor of the engines.  This air is routed through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_cycle_machine"">air cycle machines</a>, or ""packs"" as they are commonly referred to.  The packs condition the air for temperature and humidity (typically taking all of the water out of the air) and then pump this air into the cabin at high pressure such that it is at the proper temperature after expansion to cabin altitude.</p>

<p>Air exits the cabin through outflow valves, which are typically at the rear of the pressure vessel.  These can be manually or computer controlled and will open and close to regulate how much air leaves the cabin.</p>

<p>To provide constantly fresh air, the incoming air from the packs is constantly supplied and as such the cabin pressure is almost entirely regulated by the outflow valves.  These valves have to be able to exhaust more CFM of flow than the packs can supply in order to let the cabin climb and when providing less CFM
than the packs the cabin will descend.  </p>

<p>The cabin altitude will be managed so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>it stays below a maximum pressure differential with the ambient atmosphere outside,</li>
<li>cabin altitude rate of change is limited,</li>
<li>maximum cabin altitude is kept below 10k feet (and typically below 8k feet) such that supplemental oxygen is not needed.</li>

"How did SR-71 spy, flying at 80,000 ft and 3500 km/h?","9808","","<p>The <a href=""http://www.space.com/16666-sr-71-blackbird.html"">SR-71 Blackbird</a> is a famous supersonic reconnaissance/spy aircraft, undoubtedly one of the most amazing flying machines ever.

</blockquote>

<p>How was it used for spying? It must have been difficult to focus on any object on the ground, from such a great height and then many problems are encountered with high speed photography. How were these and many other problems overcome?</p>
","<p>The SR-71 Blackbird was equipped with specialized cameras. It would overfly the area of interest and take high-resolution pictures of the ground.</p>

<p>Of particular interest is the Technical Objective Camera (TEOC). It could shoot pictures with a 6'' resolution from the operational altitude of the SR-71. This task was not simple as the aircraft would have moved several hundred feet forwards during the exposure time of the picture which was (depending on the settings) around one or two tenths of a second. Without some kind of correction, this would have resulted in a picture that was blurry in the direction of motion of the aircraft.</p>

<p>To solve this, the velocity over height ratio number was fed to the camera, either manually as computed by the pilot or automatically as computed by the sensors and computer of the SR-71 (and it turns out that the machine did a better job at this than the pilot) and while the picture was taken, the high-precision mirror that directed the camera FOV downwards would rotate in the opposite direction towards which the airplane was moving, thus cancelling it out.</p>

"If flaps are used on takeoff, when should they be retracted?","9803","","<p>If a pilot uses a notch of flaps on takeoff, when do they get retracted? At that time, what changes (i.e. climb rate, speed, pitch)?</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I have purposefully not specified the type of airplane.</em></p>
","<p>The short answer is, it depends. The FAA Airplane Flying Handbook merely states that this <em>can</em> be performed once the aircraft has established positive climb, but does not specify exactly when.</p>

<p>Ultimately two situations arise:</p>

<ol>
<li>The airplane is sufficiently large/high performance that normal operating procedures specify the use of flaps for all takeoff scenarios, in which case the manufacturer or the operator (if applicable) may well specify a flap retraction schedule, which seeks to allow the aircraft to accelerate effectively during climb out, avoid overstressing the flaps by having the aircraft fly past the maximum speed for each flap setting, while at the same time maintain a comfortable margin above stall speed.</li>
<li>The airplane only requires flaps for certain kinds of takeoffs such as maximum performance or soft-field efforts. In that case, procedures may be somewhat looser in defining the exact moment of flap retraction. A climb checklist, should you choose to use one, will likely mention the flap configuration as an action/verification item, so that would likely be a good moment to retract them if you haven't done so already. Personally , I usually retract them passing thru 200-300 feet AGL, which usually coincides to the aircraft being at least half-way between clean configuration Vx and Vy (I've been mostly flying Skyhawks, Skylanes, Arrows, and Huskies). Whichever way you do it though, you want to avoid retracting them too low and too slow, but also forgetting about them and blowing through Vfe (which even light, slow airplanes can do quite handily).</li>
</ol>

<p>With respect to the actual changes in aircraft behavior the changes, you'll likely notice the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A slight-nose down moment as wing's characteristics change, which influences the airflow reaching your horizontal stabilizer. The converse applies when extending flaps. Mind you, this is an airplane model-specific thing and one that seemed most noticeable to me in the Cessna family of light singles. </li>
<li>Fort he same power setting and pitch attitude, the aircraft will begin to accelerate quicker for each notch of flap retraction.</li>
<li>Climb rate is trickier as it is dependent on you power setting, airspeed, and pitch angle; your inputs will matter. However, generally speaking, the reduction in drag would lead to a greater difference between power available (or power set) and power required, so, all things being equal, you would likely see an increase in climb rate.</li>

"Is the NTSB hostile to pilots, as depicted in the movie 'Sully'?","9774","","<p>This is based upon events portrayed in the movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3263904/?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&amp;pf_rd_p=2495768522&amp;pf_rd_r=0PGBHEQG213D6X5YK0QK&amp;pf_rd_s=right-7&amp;pf_rd_t=15061&amp;pf_rd_i=homepage&amp;ref_=hm_cht_t0"">Sully</a>.  If the film is taken at face value, what we basically see is a (fairly brazen) stitch-up attempt by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), where they try to steer an investigation towards a predetermined conclusion of 'pilot error' (and very nearly succeed) using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Naively unrealistic computer simulations that assume a pilot would divert towards the nearest landing strip immediately after a birdstrike without needing any time to evaluate the damage to their aircraft, attempt to diagnose and troubleshoot the problem, or coordinate with air-traffic-control.</li>
<li>Similarly unrealistic simulations using real pilots who have been trained/conditioned to divert immediately after the simulated birdstrike.</li>
<li>The deliberate omission of the fact that the pilots only succeeded in their simulation attempts after multiple failed training attempts, up until the pilot involved in the actual incident calls BS on the whole charade.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only motivation posited in the film for the NTSB's attitude was that the insurance company would have preferred a conclusion of 'pilot error'.  Thus, my questions are:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Is the film's portrayal of the NTSB accurate, either in terms of having a general anti-pilot bias or in terms of the particular investigation depicted having had an anti-pilot bias?</li>
<li>Why would the NTSB care about acting in the interest of insurance companies (particularly to the extent that they'd be willing to throw pilots under the bus to do so)?</li>
<li>Does an insurance company avoid a payout in the case where an aircraft is lost due to pilot error (as opposed to mechanical failure, birdstrike, or other unavoidable scenario)? </li>
</ol>
","<p>I think it is quite unfair to paint the NTSB investigators as villains just for the dramatic effect when nothing of the sort happened in real life.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is the job of the NTSB to investigate <em>all</em> possible reasons for the accident. It includes pilot error among other things. They were doing precisely that in the <em>actual</em> investigation. Among other things, the <a href=""http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NTSB concluded that</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The captain’s decision to ditch on the Hudson River rather than attempting to land at an airport provided the highest probability that the accident would be survivable.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The simulations carried out by the NTSB were part of the investigation and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/31489/9731"">were much more elaborate</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pilots were fully briefed on the maneuver before they attempted to perform it in the simulator. The following three flight scenarios were flown: </p>
  
  <p>(1) normal landings on runway 4 at LGA, starting from an altitude of 1,000 or 1,500 feet on approach; </p>
  
  <p>(2) attempted landings at LGA or TEB after the bird strike, starting both from zero groundspeed on takeoff from runway 4 at LGA and from a preprogrammed point shortly before the bird strike and loss of engine thrust; and </p>
  
  <p>(3) ditching on the Hudson River starting from 1,500 feet above the river at an airspeed of 200 kts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the NTSB clearly mentions that the pilots were briefed before the simulation. NTSB noted clearly in its report that immediate turning of the aircraft after the bird ingestion did not reflect what could've been done in real world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The immediate turn made by the pilots during the simulations did not reflect or account for real-world considerations, such as the time delay required to recognize the bird strike and decide on a course of action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simulations (along with the case where there was a 35 second delay to account for pilot response) was done entirely by the NTSB with no input whatsoever from the flight crew. As <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/sully-clint-eastwood-hudson-river-plane-crash-ntsb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Guardian</em> notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then the investigators – not Sullenberger – asked a pilot to wait 35 seconds before attempting an airport return. That flight didn’t make it. Consequently, the NTSB was unequivocal in its declaration that the Hudson was the right call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the movie was so inaccurate in the portrayal of the NTSB that the real people involved <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-ntsb-investigators-have-beef-with-movie-sully/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">asked the names of the investigators in the movie to be changed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... a draft script included the names of real-life NTSB officials, but Sullenberger - who is an adviser on the film - requested they be taken out.</p>
  
  <p>He said, ‘These are people who are not prosecutors. They are doing a very important job, and if, for editorial purposes, we want to make it more of a prosecutorial process, it ain’t fair to them,”’ said Hanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence to determine that the NTSB acted in the interest of insurance companies (or anyone else) in this investigation. The situations in which an insurance company is liable depends on the particular policy (as far as I know, liability is usually for negligence).</p>

<p>While the investigation may not be perfect, there was no kangaroo court anytime during the investigation. There was no attempt at public lynching, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/sully-clint-eastwood-hudson-river-plane-crash-ntsb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as <em>The Guardian</em> notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, in his memoir, Sullenberger reflects that he was “buoyed by the fact that investigators determined that Jeff and I made appropriate choices at every step”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no cover-up by the NTSB and there was no Kangaroo court (you can easily look up the public hearings in this case) to pin everything on the flight crew on behalf of somebody else. Though not perfect, there is nothing to suggest that the investigation was not conducted professionally. </p>

<p>It is sad that the movie portrayed officials performing their duty as villains just because it was decided that the people would rather have the ancient good Vs evil show in the movie rather than the truth (while I'd have to agree that the movie would've looked more like documentary otherwise, that is no excuse).</p>

<p>The problem though, is that more people will be seeing the movie than reading the report or looking up the actual investigation that people will have a entirely uncalled for negative opinion of the NTSB, which may affect the future investigations. As <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/03/AR2010050302120.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Robert Benson</a> who carried out investigation on the Flight 1549 <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/18/the-unsung-hero-left-out-of-sully.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">noted in an article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I do not know why the writer and director chose to twist the role of the NTSB into such an inaccurate depiction. .... The movie may actually be detrimental to aviation safety. Pilots involved in accidents will now expect harsh, unfair treatment by investigators. They and others who see the movie will now believe that the NTSB enters into any investigation with preconceived notions, and that we are intent on destroying reputations. Simply untrue. The NTSB is the best friend an airline passenger never gets to meet.""</p>

"How are APUs started?","9762","","<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/1960/3170"">How are jet engines started?</a> says that engines must be started from bleed air, which can come from the APU, another engine, or a huffer cart, or from windmilling.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, APUs are also jet engines. How are they started? In the air, they must be able to start when both engines are out, so are they able to windmill start? On the ground, can they connect to a huffer cart?</p>
","<p>APUs are like small jet engines, small enough to be started electrically. So you would use the power of the battery or an electric ground power cart to spin up the APU by its electric starter motor, and then introduce fuel into it once its spinning fast enough, just like a jet engine is started. Depending on the design, the electric motor will then either act as a generator to supply electrical power back to the aircraft or decouple when a separate generator is used.</p>

<p>The APU will spin up, and besides spinning the electric generator, some pressurized air will be 'stolen' from its compressor to supply ""bleed air"" for engine starting, the air conditioning packs, etc...</p>

<p>Big APUs like on the Boeing 777 have actually two methods of starting: They have both an air-driven and an electric driven starter motor. The method of operation is as follows: When the APU is started with the engines off, electrical power from battery or ground connection is used. After the flight, the APU will be restarted before the main engines are turned off. In that case, the APU will be started by the air-driven motor rather than the electric motor, with pressurized air supplied by the still-running main engines.</p>

<p>EDIT to answer question in comment:
Depending on size, the APU will take something between 30seconds and 2 minutes to start. The big APU of the 777 will deliver electrical power after 2 minutes or so, small units you are likely to find on regional jets can do that after perhaps 45 seconds. Then, it takes an additional 2-4 minutes until you can extract bleed air from it. That is because taking air from the compressor increases the exhaust gas temperature of the APU, and you want the APU to warm up evenly. The same is true for the shutdown process: You close the bleed-air valve and then let the APU continue to run for another two minutes or so to cool down, then shut it off completely. This lowers the thermal stress on the unit. On modern planes like the 777 this process is automated: You turn the APU selector switch to OFF and that will close the bleed air valve, initiate a 2 minute cooldown period, and eventually turn off the APU completely. The only way to shut it down immediately is in fact the APU FIRE handle.
So, you will turn the APU on typically while you are taxiing in after landing. Because of course you want it to be up and running and ready to take over the air conditioning by the time you are at the gate.
Some APUs like those found on the MD-80s have two settings for bleed air extraction: NORM and ECON. ECON takes less bleed air, thus not increasing the exhaust gas temperature of the APU too much. On particularly hot days, using the APU bleed in ECON might help not overheating the APU if it is to be used for an extended period of time.</p>

"Can commercial airliners fly over central Antarctica during winter?","9756","","<p>For example, if an airline decided they wanted to run year round flights on the great circle from Perth to Buenos Aires with a commercial airliner (e.g. A380 or B747), would they be able to do so? Or would it be too cold to fly?</p>

<p>I'm aware that there are a few sightseeing flights during the summer over Antarctica, but the winter temperatures in central Antarctica are lower than anywhere else on Earth (with surface air temperatures occasionally reaching around −90 degrees Celsius).</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, by ""winter"" I mean the coldest time of year, i.e. roughly May to September.</p>
","<p>Surface air temperatures aren't really going to be relevant for an airliner. The temperature of the troposphere doesn't vary that much. In fact, the troposphere is <em>warmer</em> at the poles (from Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere"" rel=""noreferrer"">Troposphere</a>):</p>

"Can an aircraft continue flying and land safely following an engine failure?","9751","","<p>Is it possible that an aircraft could continue to fly and then land safely on a single engine if another stopped working?</p>
","<p>The answer to your question strongly depends on what kind of airplane you're talking about (in particular, what set of rules it was certificated under), as well as the phase of flight you are in (takeoff vs. cruise vs. approach/landing) and whether you are in a jet or a (turbine or piston) propeller aircraft.  (I'm going to exclude single-engine airplanes from this discussion, as well.)</p>

<h2>Cruise Flight</h2>

<p>In general, an engine failure in cruise flight is a manageable emergency unless you are in extremely high terrain in a light twin or some other corner case.  The general procedure is to ""drift down"" in a slow-ish descent to your single-engine cruise altitude -- if you don't already have a driftdown airspeed worked out, you can use Vyse as a substitute to get a slow driftdown -- and then divert to a nearby suitable airport to get the busted engine looked at, as you'll be flying lower and less fuel-efficiently as a result.</p>

<h2>Takeoff</h2>

<p>Takeoff is the most troublesome time for an engine failure to happen, bar none: you are at high gross weight and don't have altitude under you to turn into airspeed and landing options.  What you want to do is get to the pattern altitude, fly a pattern, and land in a reasonably quick, but orderly fashion -- you don't need to ultra-hurry things even if you have an engine on fire, but you do want to get back on the ground in a reasonable timeframe to get things looked at. </p>

<h3>Light Twins (cabin class, commuter, pre-FAR 25 airliners)</h3>

<p>These aircraft, unfortunately, struggle in single-engine situations on the best of days, as the certification requirements for single-engine performance in FAR 23 are minimal at best.  The common adage you will hear about light twins, even, is ""the second engine will carry you to the scene of the crash"" -- it is possible for a light twin to be type certificated with nil or negative worst case single-engine climb performance in the case of an engine failure at or shortly after takeoff.</p>

<h3>Business Jets (certificated under FAR 23)</h3>

<p>Corporate or business-type light jet aircraft (Citations, Gulfstreams, LearJets, Beechjets, etal) and their turboprop counterparts (such as KingAirs), while often certificated under Part 23, will generally have superior single-engine performance to light twins, although this is by no means guaranteed.  You'll likely get up into the pattern and be able to make a reasonably normal single-engine landing, barring any aggravating factors at least; this is because even the smallest turbine engines are large enough that the aircraft will have some degree of excess thrust as a twin, leaving it with a thrust reserve in a single engine situation.  These aircraft are also flown by pilots with type ratings and a CPL or ATPL, which means they will be more familiar with the performance of that specific aircraft and any aircraft-specific engine-out procedures needed to eke out maximum single-engine climb rates.</p>

<h3>Twin-Engine Airliners (transport class twin turboprops and twin jets certified under FAR 25)</h3>

<p>The FAR 25 requirements for engine-out takeoff performance are much more stringent than FAR 23, and practically guarantee that the aircraft is capable of positive climb in a V1 cut (engine failure right after decision speed) at maximum takeoff weight.  In addition, V1 cuts are a classic airline training scenario that every airline flight crew on the planet runs in the sim on a regular basis (I wouldn't be surprised if a V1 cut came up every few sim sessions or so, if not every sim session).</p>

<p>In a practical sense, this means that unless the aircraft is overloaded or is suffering from something beyond a simple engine failure (I'll talk about that later), an airline flight crew will handle engine failure on takeoff in an airliner as a routine event.</p>

<h3>3 and 4 engine airliners</h3>

<p>A single engine failure on a three or four engine aircraft is by no means critical, especially on three- and four-engined jet transports.  This doesn't mean that 747 crews don't practice V1 cuts any longer, though!</p>

<h3>Props vs Jets</h3>

<p>Engine failure in a jet, whether it be a T-37 or an A380, is simple: you put appropriate rudder in, ID which engine died (between your instruments and ""dead foot, dead engine"", you should have enough data to go on), add power as needed on the working engine (say, if you are doing an assumed/FLEX temp takeoff), and kill the dead engine, then run the rest of the checklist at a leisurely pace now that safe flight is more-or-less assured.</p>

<p>Propeller aircraft are a bit more complicated though in that you need to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/11167/3825"">feather</a> the dead engine's propeller to keep it from dragging the airplane down -- older constant-speed prop designs such as those on warbirds and piston-engine airliners had FEATHER buttons for this job, one per engine; newer aircraft with constant-speed props have a gate on either the power or the condition levers that serves in place of the feathering button.  You also have more levers to manipulate when adding power to the working engine(s) and killing the dead engine, and may have more difficulty figuring out which engine died without positive flight control responses (I can only imagine how baffling a center engine failure on a Trislander would be!).</p>

<p>As a result of the critical nature of the feathering process, modern (and even some not-so-modern) transport-class (and some other) propeller aircraft have an autofeather or NTS (Negative Torque Sensing) system that will automatically drive the blades of a propeller towards (or even all the way to) the feathered position if it is armed and senses that the propeller is trying to drive the engine.  However, feathering the propeller on an engine that <em>isn't</em> shut down is also a bad idea as it causes the propeller and engine to overspeed due to the airloads the engine was driving going away.</p>

<p>Of course, if you are in a light twin with fixed-pitch propellers, none of this feathering talk applies.  Be prepared for the unexpected emission of foul language during engine-out procedures, though!</p>

<h2>Approach/Landing</h2>

<p>An engine failure during the early phases of approach is generally unproblematic -- it's similar to a failure at cruise, just minus the driftdown.  However, an engine failure on short final can be troublesome due to the high workload of an approach, combined with the thrust asymmetry induced during a full-power, single-engine go-around.  Prompt rudder inputs are essential in order to maintain aircraft track and control during such a maneuver, and engine failure checklists are best deferred until stable flight.</p>

<p>Engine failures during the landing roll are rare, by the way, and typically a non-event.</p>

<h2>Worse than Engine Failure</h2>

<p>There are engine damage scenarios that represent a greater hazard to the aircraft than a simple engine failure, or even a fire in an airliner engine.  These fall into three categories: uncontained turbine engine failures, engine detachments, and propeller failures.</p>

<h3>Uncontained Turbine Engine Failure</h3>

<p>Turbine engine failures are divided into two types: ""contained"" failures where the busted parts fly out the tailpipe, and ""uncontained"" failures where a turbine or compressor disk basically explodes radially, sending parts flying in a 360&deg; radius around the engine; at this point, further damage is a game of aerial roulette, and can range from a few holes in the cowl to near-catastrophic levels of damage that pose a threat to the entire aircraft.</p>

<h3>Engine Detachment</h3>

<p>Engines, even when pod-mounted, rarely fall off airplanes, and much of the time when they do, they depart quietly, a yanked-back thrust lever and nil engine readings the only signs of their absence visible to the flight crew.  However, a detached engine is somewhat unpredictable in its behavior, and can strike another engine on the same wing or another part of the aircraft, leading to further damage that can compromise aircraft systems or impair the operation of that neighboring engine to the point where the thrust asymmetry becomes uncontrollable.  Nacelle-mounted engines are actually <em>worse</em> in this regard -- a nacelle-mounted engine departing its nacelle leaves behind a big, draggy air scoop that will severely hamper single-engine flying, and on a light twin, this is simply insult atop injury as you have gone from ""barely making it to your site of choice"" to ""we need to pick the nearest open spot NOW because we're trying to fall out of the sky in a hurry""</p>

<h3>Propeller failure</h3>

<p>Propellers do not fail nearly as often as engines do, but when a propeller fails in flight, the results can be catastrophic; an overspeeding prop can fly apart violently or rip its mated engine apart while producing asymmetric forces that have the potential to overwhelm all flight control, while the inability to feather a failed engine's propeller turns it into a drag brake on that side of the aircraft, crippling any attempt to obtain reasonable single-engine climb performance.</p>

"How does a Mach Meter determine the speed of sound at a given altitude?","9739","","<p>By my understanding, the Mach Number at a given altitude is calculated by dividing IAS by the speed of sound at that altitude. So how is this speed of sound calculated to display the Mach Number on the Mach Meter? Does the Mach Meter share the same pitot tube used to calculate airspeed?</p>
","<p>Most modern jets use an Air Data Computer (ADC) to calculate (among other things) Mach Number.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mQ1FlptDNFg2k6xAtImkVtQ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fELpW.jpg"" alt=""ADC""></a><br>
<em>Air Data Computer</em></p>

<p>An ADC is simply a computer which accepts measurements of atmospheric data to calculate various flight related data.  </p>

<p>A typical ADC may be connected to$^1$:</p>

<p><strong>Inputs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Static System Pressure</li>
<li>Pitot Pressure</li>
<li>Total Air Temperature (TAT)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outputs (Calculated)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pressure Altitude</li>
<li>Baro-Corrected Altitude</li>
<li>Vertical Speed</li>
<li>Mach Number</li>
<li>Total Air Temperature</li>
<li>Calibrated Airspeed</li>
<li>True Airspeed</li>
<li>Digitized Pressure Altitude (Gillham) </li>
<li>Altitude Hold</li>
<li>Airspeed Hold</li>
<li>Mach Hold</li>
<li>Flight Control Gain Scheduling. </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the inputs and outputs may be analog or digital depending on the design of the system, and are used for many purposes throughout the airplane.  Each output is a purely calculated value based on the various input measurements and data stored within the unit.  </p>

<p>To answer your question about the pitot source for the Mach Meter: Yes, they use the same pitot and static sources as the airspeed indicator.  </p>

<p>In the case of mechanical instruments, they are both connected directly to the pitot static system.  </p>

<p>In the case of an ADC, the pitot static system is connected directly to the ADC and then electrical signals communicate the airspeed and mach number to the electric airspeed indicator and mach meter (or EFIS), which no longer require actual pitot static connections.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The Math</h1>

<p>A simplified example for the Mach Number calculation$^2$ would be based on the pressure inputs:</p>

<p>$$Mach~number=5((PT/PS+1)^{0.2857}–1)^\frac12$$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>$PT$ = Total Pressure<br>
$PS$ = Static Pressure </p>

<p>The actual calculation makes corrections to the pressure data to compensate for installation errors and nonlinear sensor readings.</p>

<p>Note that it doesn't actually calculate the (local) speed of sound (LSS) in order to determine the current mach number, but with the TAT input and the calculated mach number, it <em>could</em> calculate it by calculating the outside air temperature (OAT/SAT) first:</p>

<p>$$SAT=\frac{TAT}{1+0.2\times{Mach}^2}$$</p>

<p>$$LSS=38.945\sqrt{SAT}$$</p>

<p>For example, let's say that the TAT is -36C (237.16K) and we are flying Mach 0.80:  </p>

<p>$$SAT=\frac{237.16}{1+0.2\times0.8^2}=\frac{237.16}{1.128}=210.25°K=-63°C$$  </p>

<p>$$LSS=38.945\sqrt{210.25}=38.945\times14.5=564.70knots$$  </p>

<p>Again, these are simplified formulas because the actual ones would consider sensor error, etc.</p>

<sup>Potomac consolidated TRACON, operation room (<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control#Approach_and_terminal_control"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</sup></p>

<p>A TRACON is the name in the US for what is also known in other countries as the <em>Terminal Control Center</em>, the control in charge of operations close to one or more large airports (but not on the airports themselves). TRACON manage arrivals and departures, the related transitions to/from cruise, and also aircraft transiting in their area.</p>

<p>From Nasa's <a href=""http://virtualskies.arc.nasa.gov/atm/5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air Traffic Management System</a> page (with some adjustments):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TRACONs are facilities containing radar operations from which air
  traffic controllers direct aircraft:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>During departure, descent and approach phases of flight.</li>
  <li>Transitioning from the en route phase through to the approach phase into a destination airport located within the TRACON’s airspace. </li>
  <li>Transitioning after takeoff to the departure phase until the flight is handed off to the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) for its
  en route phase, [...] via a preferential departure route (PDR) leading
  away from the departure airport.</li>

  <p>One TRACON can handle the air traffic for several different airports

  <p>Although the controller's individual responsibility is only for his or

  information on all the aircraft that are under control of the entire
  TRACON facility. In addition, these controllers are able to
  communicate with one another instantly- something that contributes
  significantly to assuring the safety of aircraft passengers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As emphasized by @TomMcW in his comment, smaller airfields don't have an associated TRACON, the approaches and departures are in this case directly managed by controllers at the airfield tower.</p>

<p>Controllers mostly use the Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) or the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) to track aircraft:</p>

"How does banner tow attach and release work?","9732","","<p>Planes can sometimes be seen <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_advertising#Fixed-wing_aircraft"">towing banners</a> around large cities or events. </p>

<p>How is the banner attached for takeoff?</p>

<p>How does the plane land after towing a banner?</p>
","<p>There are actually a couple of different towing mechanisms out there. You've got your traditional banner pick, with the ropes and the hooks and all that, but there's also a new type of billboard mechanism that allows a tow aircraft to take off with the billboard already attached; it unfurls as the aircraft gains altitude, and can eliminate a potential inefficiency in the process (some days are worse for banner picks than others due to high winds, turbulence, etc.), but it limits the tow aircraft to some pretty small billboards and letter banners are pretty much a no-go.</p>

<p>Talking about the traditional method of banner towing, there are a couple of things to cover.</p>

<ul>
<li>The banner/billboard setup on the ground - they will be attached to a tow rope (usually about 200 feet long) with a loop at the end. This loop is strung out between two poles a small distance apart. The goal of a banner pick is to have the hook pass between the poles, thru the loop; do that and you will be able to pick the banner off the ground. The banner or billboard will be laid down upwind of the poles (with the tow rope fully extended), so that the pick takes place into the wind; the lower ground speed will help with timing and allow the banner or billboard to come off the ground more smoothly. A small windsock is a common addition next to the poles to make it easier for the pilot to spot them and to give some local wind information. The banners and billboards may be set up parallel to a runway (usually the active runway), or there may be a designated spot elsewhere on the field.</li>
<li>The hook itself is attached to aircraft with a tow hitch and it is possible to have multiple hitches on the same aircraft (highest number i ever saw was 4 on a Piper Pawnee); they get used sequentially i.e. drop the hook, pick up the banner, fly the banner, drop the banner, drop the next hook, pick up the next banner, fly said banner, and so on until you run out of hooks. Most of the time, hooks that are not in use will be tied down somewhere accessible to the pilot who will drop them manually. That Pawnee I mentioned earlier, however, had the hooks attached to hitches on the aircraft's belly, from where they would be released with a switch, so there's more than one way to skin a cat. The hooks are normally attached prior to engine start and the pilot needs to make sure there is no slack in the line, to avoid it becoming entangled in rudder or elevator cables (more on that later), or other assorted bits and pieces of equipment.</li>
<li>Banner tow procedures

<ol>
<li>Take off is normal, but depending on your hook and cockpit setup, you may have to hold the hook in your throttle hand as you're taking off (this was the case with the Husky I towed in). Be careful not to hit anything with it.</li>
<li>After climbing through about 50 feet AGL, side-step the runway, and drop the hook. Procedure varies depending on your setup, but we used to extend the arm holding the hook as far out the window as we could get, give a gentle tap on the rudder to kick the tail out of the way and toss the hook outwards and away from the airplane. Kicking the rudder was important due to the way the rudder control cables ran in the Husky; we had one pilot who didn't and nearly wrecked when the rope got fouled around the cables, forcing a rudder hard-over once there was tension in the line after the pick - fortunately he was a big guy and the runway was sufficiently long that he was able to overpower the rudder and make a safe landing. Tossing the hook outwards is important lest it get caught up in the propwash and bang against the skin of the aircraft. Again, this happened (wasn't me though).</li>
<li>Coming around for the banner pick - depending on where the banners are set up, you may end up flying almost a regular traffic pattern, but it usually happens at much lower altitudes (5-600 feet) and the banner tow waiver may require that you avoid flying over populated areas to do so, so you may end up flying, say a right-hand pattern instead of your regular left. Either way you end up doing it, you want to end up downwind of the poles, similarly, if you will, to coming in for landing.</li>
<li>The actual banner pick - this is where you'll see a lot of variation. Some outfits will come in flat, just above the poles and pull up once they pass them (unusual, but some do it that way), others will come in high and dive towards the poles, and pull up once past them (it's very pretty and dramatic, but not a lot of room for error IMO). We used to be a bit more sedate about it, and came in as if for a landing, with the goal of touching down at the top of the banner (i.e. the end nearest to you). Obviously, you have to correct for crosswind, which you can do by shifting your line left or right depending on wind direction; the goal is to place the hook, which is trailing behind you and getting blown about by the wind, between the poles. Either way you do it, once you pass the poles, you pitch up immediately to at least 45 degrees or so, and apply full throttle. You zoom climb to about 200 feet AGL and then reduce the pitch angle to be able to maintain a slow-speed climb. Do this right and the banner or billboard will come smoothly off the ground; you may feel a slight tug as tension is applied through the towline if you haven't been smooth enough and ended up yanking the banner off the ground. Continue to climb to whichever altitude you've planned for and, when stabilized in the climb, try to take a look behind you (if you can) to make sure you've picked successfully and that the banner didn't get damaged or something. If you can't look behind you, you can check during a turn, or have your ground crew radio/text and let you know.</li>
<li>Fly the banner - you want to fly slow enough to avoid stressing the engine, airframe, tow rope and banner, but not quite so slow that the engine can't get enough airflow to cool down (remember, on the backside of the power curve, power required increases the slower you try to fly). Watch your altitude and distance from people and objects (the powers that be are quite serious about it), look out for towers (especially those that come with guide cables and the like), high rise buildings, and other traffic, and try not to get too bored flying in circles for hours.</li>
<li>Drop the banner - when you come back in to drop the banner, the goal is to drop it low enough to the ground that the wind won't have time to blow it away onto  active runways (or into the trees - I had to help pull somebody else's banner out of the trees once, not fun). Ideally, you might want to drop it as close as you can to where the ground crew has their bags and everything setup to spare them having to haul heavy banners and billboards over long distances. You release the hook using a lever bolted onto the floor of the aircraft and then apply power, climb out, and come around for another pick or a landing, whatever the case may be.</li>
</ol></li>

<p>A coast-guard lifeboat is designed to self-recover from a capsize and can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmWhp8Qw9Fg"" rel=""noreferrer"">roll through 360 degrees without significant structural damage</a>. A cruise-liner would not survive being rolled over completely. </p>

<p>If a vehicle is not designed to perform a high stress maneuver it is safe to assume an unmodified vehicle cannot do so without incurring severe damage.</p>

<h2>Inside loop</h2>

<p>Regarding an inside loop, the <a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/229/is-it-possible-to-loop-or-roll-a-747-jet"" rel=""noreferrer"">world's smartest man</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looping a 747 or a DC-10 would be trickier [than rolling one ...]  Boeing suspects its planes could make it, but since no one has ever been silly enough to try, there's no way of knowing for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Outside loop</h2>

<p>An outside loop is much much more stressful on airframe and pilots as it involves negative G. Airliners have flight envelopes that have much less capability under negative G. There must be a very high probability the aircraft would break up when attempting an outside loop.</p>

<h2>Roll</h2>

<p>A barrel roll is a less stressful maneuver.</p>

<p>60 years ago, in 1955, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_M._Johnston"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Tex"" Johnston</a>, a Boeing test pilot performed a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra_khhzuFlE"" rel=""noreferrer"">barrel roll in a Boeing 707</a>. So far as I can find out, no one has since deliberately attempted to replicate this stunt in a commercial airliner. At the time of publishing his autobiography, the pilot claimed in a <a href=""http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900228&amp;slug=1058594"" rel=""noreferrer"">newspaper report</a> that the stunt was planned by him but unknown to his boss.</p>

<p>in 1985 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines_Flight_006"" rel=""noreferrer"">China Airlines 006</a>, a 747, inadvertently executed a half roll but suffered structural damage. It rolled to 60 degrees before the pilot disengaged the autopilot, the pilots suffered spatial disorientation and the roll continued into a dive. The pilots obviously weren't flying the aircraft within its limits - meaning you can't read a lot into this, other than it might be easy to break up the aircraft while attempting this sort of maneuver.</p>

"Is a helicopter ride unsafe for young children?","9729","","<p>Recently we were in London and noticed how so many helicopter rides were there. While booking a ride I found out that they do not take a child under 4 years of age, none of the Heli ride companies I found in London allowed any child under 4 to take their rides.</p>

<p>So we were unable to take that ride since our child is  3 years old. I was wondering why is it unsafe for children to fly in a heli when the same or much younger children fly in a commercial airliner all over the world all the time?</p>

<p>Obviously I do not question their judgment and I do appreciate their concern for safety I just would like to know what makes it unsafe so we can prepare accordingly before taking that ride when he is 4.</p>

<p>I have been in helicopters I do not find them particularly challenging for a passenger. Could the primary reason be that these heli tours are not ordinary flight from A to B, they do quite some sprints and sharp turns up there to add to the fun.</p>

<p>It is very hard to prove a negative, but I hope this is enough to convince you. Operators are under no obligation to justify their rules.</p>

<hr>

<p>Original answer follows:</p>

<p>There is nothing inherently stopping an infant taking a flight on board a helicopter.</p>

<p>I suspect this has everything to do with the operators of these flights do not have the equipment to properly ensure the security and safety of infants. </p>

<p>Airlines typically provide extender belts for infants on laps. They also have provision for dealing with emergency situations with infants on board. This is because it is what their customers <em>require</em> and makes commercial sense to provide those services.</p>

<p><a href=""https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%20789.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CAP 789</a> (which is guidance for operators) has something to say about this (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EU-OPS, JAR-OPS 3 and the ANO require the aircraft commander to ensure that at
  certain times each passenger on board occupies a seat or berth with his safety belt
  (or harness where provided) properly secured. These regulations also require the
  aircraft commander to ensure that multiple occupancy of seats does not occur except
  by one adult and <strong>one infant who is properly secured by a supplementary loop belt or
  other restraint device.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The clientele of helicopter pleasure flights probably do not <em>regularly</em> require bringing infants aboard. So there is little requirement or commercial pressure for them to do so. </p>

<p>The ""must be 4 years of age"" is quite possibly entirely arbitrary - in that they are probably large enough to use the standard harnesses/belts/noise protection provided. Operators probably do not routinely carry things like infant noise protection, and helicopters are noisy environments.</p>

<p>Some child restraint systems used in cars are appropriate for use in aircraft, and some operators may have allowed you to bring your car child seat on board for use with your infant (More info is available <a href=""https://www.casa.gov.au/file/104866/download?token=UTchjlft"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).

<p>Then a few seconds later we enter turbulence, grab a hold of that half-finished soda cup and wait patiently for the bumps to be over while looking out the window.</p>

<p>So, <strong>how exactly do the pilots know that the airplane is about to enter in an air pocket which will cause turbulence?</strong></p>

<p>... or does it happen like <a href=""http://www.pprune.org/rotorheads/531241-north-sea-helicopter-incident.html#post8247920"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>?</p>

<hr>

<p>I have already gone through the excellent answers <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/2587/65"">here</a> and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/1893/65"">here</a>.</p>
","<p>There are a few ways that pilots are aware of potentially turbulent areas.  </p>

<p><strong>Eyesight</strong>
The most obvious way is just by looking outside and observing the sky.  Large billowing clouds, called cumulus clouds, indicated pockets of unstable air (the clouds are rising because the air under them is as well).  If the pilots must fly through these clouds then its a safe bet that there will be some turbulence.</p>

<p><strong>Weather Radar</strong>
Just like using your eyes, except the radar can see further through haze and other clouds.  Typically this is useful for finding embedded thunderstorms, but it can also be useful to find areas of potential turbulence.</p>

<p><strong>Communication</strong>
Pilots talk.  Both to each other and to air traffic controllers.  En route controllers frequently ask pilots for ""PIREPS"" (pilot reports), to build an accurate picture of the flight conditions at different altitudes.  Often commercial aircraft will request to change altitudes or deviate around weather/ turbulence, so it is in the best interest of the controller to know ahead of time where the bad flight conditions are, and have a game plan of how to route traffic.  This makes it much easier for the controller to route traffic, rather than getting request after request from individual aircraft.</p>

"Why does supersonic flight detach airflow from a wing?","9706","","<p>I've read in several answers to questions that when a wing passes the speed of sound the airflow will become detached from the craft towards the rear quarter of the wing (thus making things like elevators ineffective.)</p>

<p>Why does this happen at Mach Speed?  Can it happen at lower speeds as well (in straight and level flight, ie, not stalled)?</p>
","<p>Flow separation happens when the pressure gradient of the airflow along the flow path becomes too steep. In subsonic flow, the oncoming air is first decelerated ahead of the wing, then swiftly accelerated when it flows around the strongly curved nose section of a wing. This acceleration is the consequence of the wing's curvature. See it this way: If the airflow would be along a straight line, it would move away from the surface, creating a local vacuum. In reality, the air settles at a compromise between the straight path and following the contour, creating decreasing pressure along a surface with increasing curvature and increasing pressure along surfaces with decreasing curvature. More precisely, it is always in an equilibrium between inertial, viscous and pressure forces.<P></p>

<p>This suction not only bends the airflow into following the wing's contour, but also accelerates the air ahead of it. The lower the pressure, the more the air speeds up, such that the total energy of air (the sum of pressure and kinetic energy) stays constant. Therefore, pressure and local speed change in sync.<P></p>

<p>When the curvature decreases further downstream, the flow path becomes straighter and pressure rises again. However, the air particles close to the wing slow down because of friction. The layer of air where this slowing is noticeable is called boundary layer. In it, the deceleration effects due to pressure rise and due to friction add up, and at some point the air comes to a standstill relative to the wing. Where this happens, static air will collect and build up, causing flow separation. Thankfully, the exchange of air across a turbulent boundary layer kicks the slowest air particles downstream, so at moderate angles of attack the air still moves along until it reaches the trailing edge. Only when the suction peak around the nose becomes very high at high angle of attack, the consequent steep pressure rise along the remaining flow path overpowers the possibilities of the turbulent boundary layer, the air decelerates completely and the flow separates. This is a wholly subsonic affair.
<P>
If the wing moves at high subsonic speed, the curvature-created suction accelerates the flow such that it reaches supersonic speed. Now something odd happens: Supersonic flow accelerates further when subsonic flow would decelerate. This is caused by the change in density which is dominant at supersonic speed. Incompressible (= very slow) flow has constant density, and all speed changes affect pressure. At Mach 1, the pressure and density changes are of equal magnitude, and in supersonic flow the density changes dominate. Now we have a supersonic pocket of air on the upper surface of the wing where speed increases and density decreases downstream, and the surrounding subsonic air sees little change in density. This picture should give you some idea how it looks:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoG88.png"" alt=""Lambda shock in high subsonic flow""></p>

<p>The whole wing moves at Mach 0.68. Compare the green color at some distance from the wing with the scale on the left side, which gives the Mach number for each color shade. At the airfoil nose, you see a blue area. This is where the air decelerates - it gets pushed together by the approaching wing. Now follow the colors along the upper side - they quickly turn green, yellow and red as the air is accelerated into the low pressure area (remember, low pressure equals high speed, so the reddest area has the highest local flow speed and the lowest pressure). In subsonic flow, the suction peak would be somewhere between 20% and 30% of chord, and the colors would slowly change back to yellow and green if you move further downstream. Now we have local supersonic flow (everything redder than light orange is supersonic here), and instead of slowly decelerating, the air is speeding up to a maximum Mach number of 1.23 at almost 60% of chord length.</p>

<p>This cannot last, and at some point this supersonic pocket collapses. This happens instantly in a shock, and as you know, in a straight shock density increases suddenly and speed decreases such that the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/12001/what-causes-the-reduction-in-speed-across-the-shockwave/12003?s=1%7C0.2673#12003"">Mach number after the shock is the inverse of the Mach number ahead of the shock</a>. In the picture above, boundary layer effects create a lambda shock, which has its name from the Greek letter which looks like the shock pattern here. Aft of the shock, you have subsonic flow again, and a much thicker boundary layer which moves very slowly (blue shade). This is due to the energy conversion through the shock, which converts kinetic energy into heat. But the flow is still attached - even this shock did not cause separation.
<P>
If this pressure rise is big enough, the boundary layer will come to an instantaneous standstill, and then the flow separates. This is the shock induced separation you asked about. Unfortunately, the picture above is the best I could find, and I have none with separated flow aft of the shock. But it helps to show that the center of pressure moves aft. This causes a strong nose-down moment. Also, with higher subsonic Mach numbers directional stability decreases. Now even more nasty things can happen: The location of the shock might move forward and back. This changes the size of the supersonic area, causing lift changes. On a horizontal tail, this will also cause pitch changes. If you change elevator position slightly with such a shock on the horizontal tail, the lift change could be severe and in the opposite direction of what you would expect. This causes total loss of control, just when you need the control surfaces to counteract the Mach effects mentioned above. Also, the shock position could oscillate, causing a buzzing sound and, if you are really unlucky, coupling into an elastic eigenfrequency of your structure, resulting in flutter. Not only on the tail surfaces, but also on the wing, affecting the ailerons as well. Now you can start to see what scared the early pioneers about flying near Mach 1 and why they spoke of a ""sound barrier"".
<P>
If you fly fully supersonic, this effect goes away because now the shock moves to the trailing edge and stays there. Now everything will be calm again because the shock location stays fixed. This effect was first experienced and survived on April 9, 1945 by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Guido_Mutke"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hans Guido Mutke in a Me-262</a>, which briefly flew fully supersonic in a dive. However, even in fully supersonic flow separation is possible, but then because the air flow will not bend more than what can be caused by total vacuum. In hypersonic flow the density changes become so severe that pockets of ""air"" are possible which do not contain any air, but a vacuum. But this is more an academic case, except for reentry vehicles with a blunt, rear-facing base.</p>

","<p>As the previous answers have stated, their schedules are determined by what best suits their needs. However, those schedules can be complicated by contractual and curfew requirements.</p>

<p>A contractual example: Thousands of expatriate Brits live in the south of Spain. They want their morning London papers. We would depart Stansted (just north of London) as soon as possible. We were contractually committed to have the load to Barcelona by 07:00 local, with huge penalties if we failed (the papers were worthless by noon), and then on to Palma de Mallorca. Hopefully by now, they transmit the papers electronically and print them locally.</p>

<p>A curfew example: A cargo flight departing Hong Kong bound for Chitose, Japan (refuel there then on to Anchorage). The old Kai Tak airport at Hong Kong had a 23:00 local curfew; Chitose had a curfew until 06:00 local. The solution to that was to depart Hong Kong just before the curfew, land at Taipei and park for a couple of hours (I forget the exact time), and then continue to Chitose to arrive just after 06:00 local.</p>

<p>All Japan airports at the time had a curfew from 23:00 local to 06:00. You could go out to the south end of the airport just before 06:00 local, and set your watch by the first arrival of what was tens of aircraft, both passenger and cargo, whose departure time was determined by the need to arrive as soon as possible after the airport opened</p>

","<p>At the absolute simplest, compared to a two-bladed propeller, a slightly smaller three-bladed propeller can produce more thrust at a given RPM, improving climb performance. Because of the smaller diameter, the propeller tips actually travel slower than the equivalent two-bladed design, reducing noise inside and outside the airplane.</p>

<p>Hartzell Propeller has a great <a href=""http://hartzellprop.com/faq/technical-questions/"">set of technical answers about propellers</a>. Their explanation of why more blades produces less noise is pretty good:</p>

  <p>A 2-blade propeller produces two pressure pulses per revolution, where a 3-blade propeller will produce three smaller pulses per revolution (for the same amount of total thrust) which is inherently smoother and therefore quieter.

Aircraft moving at a slow, near-stall speed, despite pointing the nose up, will still be traveling more or less horizontally.  Their VSI instrument will read near zero.  Whereas, if you take an aircraft moving quickly and pull the nose up to the same angle, the aircraft will, obviously, climb rapidly.</p>

<p>Why does this matter?  The angle of attack is defined based on the wing's motion through the relative wind.  The wing's orientation relative to the ground isn't involved in the definition in any way.  When the aircraft as a whole is climbing, the relative wind is coming down from above.  As a result the angle of attack is reduced, compared to what it would be if the plane were not climbing.</p>

<p>Just to show some quick numbers, suppose you took an aircraft moving at 100 kts in still air and pulled the nose up so that you are now climbing at 3,000 FPM (most aircraft will lose speed doing this, but the math is valid until the airplane slows down).  $1knot\approx100FPM$, so you'll now have an upward vector of 30 knots.  Your 100 kt airspeed is now moving up at an angle.  A little trigonometry:</p>

<p>$$\sin(x)=\frac{30}{100}$$
$$x=17.46°$$</p>

<p>So, your angle of attack is 17.46 degrees farther away from stalling when climbing at 3000FPM than it would be if your aircraft had the same pitch but was in level flight.</p>

<p>However, few aircraft have the engine power to sustain a climb at this rate.  The aircraft will bleed off speed, and as the speed bleeds off, the aircraft will slow, the climb rate will decrease, the aircraft's velocity will become closer to horizontal, and, eventually, the aircraft will stall if the pitch is held constant.</p>

"Instrument landing: why do all electronic devices need to be shut off?","9663","","<p>A few days ago, I took a flight home. Towards the end of the journey, the captain asked us to shut down any electronic device that we had on board, including iPods, CD players, phones and so on, because there was very low visibility, and we were starting an instrument approach.</p>

<p>From what I could understand, an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system"">Instrument Landing  System (ILS)</a> allows an aircraft to be centred on the approach path, assisted by radio signals delivered by an ILS (a localiser and a glide slope), without any visual reference. These signals are in the 110 MHz (LOC) and 330 MHz (GS) frequency range.</p>

<p>Given that for the take off, visual landing, and the journey itself, shutting off the devices is no longer required (even though there are radio signals being used for communications and navigation), why this extra precaution on a low-visibility ILS approach? What interference could a CD Player possibly produce with the instrumentation to an extent that it's more dangerous than with the normal take off,en route, and landing phases?</p>

<p>On a side note: as you probably understood, my level of expertise is very low, so forgive any dumb mistake or oversight.</p>
","<p>Short answer: ILS is rather sensitive to interference and not all electronic devices take much precaution in avoiding the generation of interference. The pilot wants to be sure that the readings he's getting on the localizer and glideslope are accurate, since he can't actually see the runway to verify the final approach path visually.</p>

<p>Longer answer: ILS is actually relatively simplistic as RF signals go. Both the localizer and the glideslope just consist of a pair of AM signals that are broadcast directionally. For both systems, the modulated frequencies are 90 Hz and 150 Hz. For the localizer, 90 Hz is broadcast to the left of the runway centerline and 150 Hz is broadcast to the right of the centerline. When the aircraft is aligned with the runway, it will receive equal strength signals of both frequencies. When it's to the right, it will receive more power from the 150 Hz signal and when it's to the left, it will receive more power from the 90 Hz signal. The glideslope works pretty much the same way, just with the 150 Hz signal transmitted below the glide path and the 90 Hz signal transmitted above it. <a href=""http://instrument.landingsystem.com/ils-ground-equipment/#localizer-transmitter"">[1]</a> <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/glidescope_story.html"">[2]</a></p>

<p>Now, suppose some passenger's electronic device is emitting a frequency that it shouldn't be. This is not exactly unheard of among consumer electronic devices. This is more common among devices manufactured in countries with less-strict emissions testing requirements/enforcement, but it's possible due to slight defects in almost any device. [Source: I design RF receivers for a living.] Now suppose that this noise happens to be on the localizer or glideslope frequency for the runway to which the aircraft is flying an approach. Hopefully you're starting to see a problem here... Whatever amplitude changes are happening on this unintended emission are now being received by the AM demodulator of the localizer or glideslope, potentially confusing it and, in low visibility conditions, causing the aircraft to be directed somewhere other than the runway threshold. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_flight_into_terrain"">Needless to say, that's bad.</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/glidescope_story.html#3"">Boeing recommends the following actions for flight crews flying ILS approaches</a> in order to detect erroneous ILS readings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crosschecking altitude and DME distance periodically.</li>
<li>Crosschecking altitude and flight management system (FMS) threshold distance.</li>
<li>Crosschecking altitude and the crossing altitude of the outer marker (or locator, very-high-frequency omnirange [VOR] navigation equipment, or FMS).</li>
<li>Crosschecking radio altitude and barometric altitude.</li>
<li>Crosschecking ground speed and rate of descent.</li>
<li>Questioning air traffic controllers when indications do not appear to be correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, even when following those instructions, slightly erroneous ILS signals may be hard to detect until too late. If a DME is showing that you're half a mile off, you can probably notice that, but a couple hundred feet off might not be noticeable (but is still plenty to be a big problem.)</p>

</ul>

<h2>Quick design comment:</h2>

<p>Aircraft galleys are hotspots for corrosion due to the liquid in the area and is the cause for particular attention during maintenance. Most aircraft galleys are generally very similar in design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Galley equipment comes in 2 basic universal standards - namely ATLAS and KSSU. These have their origins in legacy maintenance resource pools (ATLAS = Alitalia, TAP, Lufthansa, Air France, Sabena and KSSU = KLM, Swissair, SAS, UTA) and have subsequently developed into industry standards to enable modular equipment interchange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These standards for instance specify the height, width and depth of trolleys. I gather that ATLAS standard is more prevalent (80% of galleys by one source) but both exist. Other ideas and concepts have popped up but since changing the stuff is very expensive there's not been a real push for it. I think I've also read that the original standard was pretty well thought through.</p>

<p>Naturally, this is a long-distance galley that will serve usually two meals. Equipment and size are scaled to the needs of the airline and can vary greatly between operators.</p>

"Why do model aircraft fly and maneuver so differently from real aircraft?","9621","","<p>I recently viewed on Youtube many videos of small and giant models of airplanes. In some cases they are small (for example an A330, 1 meter long) and in others they are huge (for example an A380, 5 meters long).</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the smallest ones seem to have electric engines (maybe fake jet engines in which fans act as propellers?) but the bigger ones seem to have internal combustion engines, even if I don't know how they run.</p>

<p>Anyway, the general impression is that even from a great distance it's obvious that they are models and not real aircraft. They are all too quick, too agile, make very short takeoffs, have very low inertia, make quick turns and so on.</p>

<p>Can you tell me why these handling differences exist in models that otherwise tend to simulate with great precision every other detail of the real aircraft (lights, shape, colors, fine details, landing gear, etc.)? </p>
","<p>It's partly inherent in the way things scale.</p>

<p>If you double the length of the model, then the wing area (length times width) increases by a factor of 4, but the weight and volume (length times width times height) will increase by a factor of 8 ... so doubling the size means halving the weight-to-lift ratio.</p>

<p>In the most extreme cases, a tiny model will blow away on a puff of wind, and a huge model (bigger than the real plane) can't take off at all.</p>

<p>I suppose you might theoretically try to make small models harder to fly, by adding extra weight.</p>

<hr>

<p>The above is theoretically true but maybe nonsense in practice: it assumes that structural materials become thinner when the model is scaled, in reality the structure isn't even the same material.</p>

<p>So let's look at it another way:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A full-scale A380 weighs let's say <strong>500 tons</strong>, length about <strong>70 metres</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Decrease that to 1 metre model and the surface area has decreased by (70x70=) <strong>5000</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>So for the model to have the same weight-to-area as the full-scale plane, it would need to weigh (500 tons / 5000 =) <strong>100 kg</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your 1 metre model presumably weighs much less than 100 kg, therefore it has much less weight-to-area ratio. QED.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's also important to consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reynolds number</a>, which depends on the air's viscosity and density, and on the size and speed of the model. The Reynolds number affects turbulence, which is very important to a wing's lift (for an example of how even a tiny change has a large effect, see <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/17663/2703"">Can a sandpaper-thick layer of ice reduce lift by 30 percent and increase drag up to 40 percent?</a>).</p>

<p>To get the right Reynolds number for a small model you must increase the density (e.g. pressure) of the air, or increase its speed. But given the ordinary speed of aircraft, you couldn't increase (scale up) the air speed because it would become super-sonic, which would change the scenario.</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/313688/3773"">this answer to 'Understanding the Reynolds-number scaling problem'</a>, and the comments below it, I think that a 1-metre model of a 70-metre A380 (so a scale of 70:1) might behave like the full-scale model if it were flown under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>air density is scaled up, so 70 atmospheres of air pressure</li>
<li>lift and drag are scaled down, so:

<ul>
<li>weight of the model is 7 tons (instead of 500 tons)</li>
<li>thrust of the model is 4,000 lb (instead of 300,000 lbs), i.e. about 2 tons</li>
</ul></li>
<li>air speed is realistic (e.g. 150 knots to take off)</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously this would be quite unusual for a model airplane<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sub>Air liquifies at 60 atmospheres; and the model would need a specific density of about 100, i.e. 5 times heavier than gold or uranium).</sub></p>

"What are the advantages of more than 4 propeller blades?","9592","","<p>I have heard that propellers with more than four blades are not as efficient as 4 or less blades because of lower thrust which may result from interfering prop-streams. But I see the ATR-42/72 and they have 6 blades. What is the reasoning and the advantages to that prop layout?</p>
","<p>You are right, more blades are bad for <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14305/what-is-the-propeller-efficiency-%CE%BC-p-of-modern-propellers-for-light-sport-airc/15383#15383"">efficiency</a> (follow the link for the definition). <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21354/possible-to-fly-with-counterbalanced-single-blade-engines/21358#21358"">Ideally, a propeller should have only one blade</a>. Every additional blade will cause disturbances which interfere with the flow on the other blades.</p>

<p>When engine power increases, the propeller disc area should also grow, but this growth is limited by the resulting speed of the blade tips. Once the flow speed there becomes supersonic, the drag at this section of the blade increases without a corresponding increase in thrust. To avoid that, the next best option is to increase the solidity ratio of the propeller, called also the <a href=""http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/qna/questions/Propellers_Activity_Factor.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activity ratio</a>. This is done by either increasing blade chord or the number of blades.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, this is bad for efficiency. But if there is enough power available, adding more blades is the best way to transform that engine power into thrust.</p>

<p>Take the Supermarine Spitfire:</p>

<ul>
<li>The prototype, powered by the 1,030 hp <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Merlin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rolls-Royce PV-12</a>, had a two-bladed propeller</li>
<li>From the Mk II, a three-bladed propeller was fitted to accommodate the increasing power of the RR Merlin (1,470 hp for the Spitfire Mk V).</li>

<p>A lower prop speed allows to increase its diameter, but while tip speed will drop by less than the reduction in prop speed (after all, flight speed should not change), the available thrust from this propeller will drop by the square of the speed reduction, since thrust is proportional to the dynamic pressure on the blades. And thrust you get only from the circumferential fraction of the local speed at the blade; flight speed does not count here and does not help to mitigate the reduction. Consequence: You cannot make the propeller bigger and spin it more slowly for a given power.</p>

"Can a plane fly backward if its propeller is in reverse?","9590","","<p>I would like to know if a prop plane, for example the P-51, could be able to fly backward. Is it possible through some trick like changing blade angle or reverse the prob rotation direction? It would have been hard for piloting, but is this theoretically possible?</p>
","<p>Fly? No.<br>
Wings generally only produce enough lift to keep an aircraft aloft when air is flowing over them in their intended direction. If you reverse the airflow over the wing (by moving backwards in the air, for example) the wing would no longer be producing the necessary lift, and the aircraft would ""descend at an extremely rapid rate"" until a normal airflow over the wings was restored. (That's the polite way of saying ""the darn thing falls out of the sky like a rock!"")</p>

<p>Move? Yes. At least on the ground.<br>
This has been demonstrated on more than one occasion by <a href=""https://youtu.be/2C6tu9LNMs0?t=8m10s"" rel=""nofollow"">Fat Albert</a>, the C-130 that supports the Blue Angels.  While the propellers themselves do not reverse, the blade pitch is changed to produce reverse thrust (slowing the aircraft the same way thrust reversers do on a jet engine, and in this case <em>reversing</em> its direction of travel).</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that there is one notable exception to the ""airplanes can't fly backwards"" rule, <a href=""/questions/19114/can-a-plane-fly-backward-if-its-propeller-is-in-reverse#comment43813_19114"">which the article Ethan linked to alludes to</a>: If the wind velocity exceeds the aircraft's stall speed it's possible for an aircraft to ""fly"" at its minimum airspeed, but be moving backwards relative to the ground.<br>
This is a bit of a cheat though: The airplane still thinks it's flying forward (the relative velocity of the wind over the wings is in the ""normal"" direction, and the <em>airspeed</em> is fast enough to create enough lift to sustain flight). It just happens the the airspeed includes a headwind component sufficient to give the aircraft a net ""negative"" <em>groundspeed</em>.<br>
The hypothetical P-51 in your question would require sustained winds of about 83 knots to make this trick work (we generally call that a hurricane), but something like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_J-3_Cub"" rel=""nofollow"">Piper Cub</a> can do it at much more reasonable wind speeds.</p>

"Why does the US use two types of aerial refueling?","9578","","<p>There are two main types of aerial refueling, the boom and the drogue. The US uses both, while most other countries use just the drogue.</p>

<p>How are they different and why does the US use both?</p>
","<p>The <strong>flying boom method</strong> uses a rigid boom which is ""flown"" by an operator in coordination with the pilot in order to make a connection with a receptacle on the second aircraft. The boom is retracted when not in use. Though <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_Palomares_B-52_crash"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it can do damage</a> if it comes in contact with an aircraft, <a href=""http://newsok.com/old-video-shows-near-midair-collision-involving-oklahoma-refueling-tanker/article/3722677"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the operator can quickly move the boom if needed</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdLXh.jpg"" alt=""Refueling with boom""></p>

<p>The <strong>probe and drogue method</strong> uses a trailing hose with a basket on the end. Pilots will guide a probe on their aircraft into the basket to connect with the hose. The hoses are retracted when not in use. Though the crew has less control of the drogue, which <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=sNYDBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can still cause damage</a>, there is less danger to the aircraft than from a boom, and it could allow the aircraft to stay further away from the tanker.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yWY9e.jpg"" alt=""Refueling with drogue""></p>

<p>The boom method was developed early on in the Cold War, when <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Chrome_Dome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strategic Air Command had many large bombers that needed to be refueled</a>. They needed a method that would transfer fuel as fast as possible in order to reduce the time it took to transfer the large amounts of fuel needed. Because the boom is rigid, it is capable of a higher transfer rate. The importance of bombers meant that SAC got their way, and the KC-135 fleet was equipped with booms. Today, almost all US Air Force planes capable of aerial refueling use the boom system.</p>

<p>The US Navy on the other hand, along with most aircraft in other countries, uses the drogue system. Though this method is not capable of the high transfer rates of a boom, it is much more flexible. A refueling aircraft may only be fitted with one boom, and this requires extra design work and integration with the fuselage. The drogue system, on the other hand, is more simple, and does not need a dedicated operator. This means that it can be more easily fitted to the refueling aircraft, even <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other fighter planes</a>, and larger aircraft can have multiple drogues.</p>

<p>Another point is that smaller aircraft such as fighters are not capable of receiving fuel at the full rate the boom provides, so they have less benefit from the system. Although a boom can have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling#Boom_drogue_adapter_units"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drogue adapter attached</a>, this still commits the tanker to one aircraft at a time and one type of system per flight. Also, aircraft such as helicopters <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/12006/1696"">cannot use a boom system</a>.</p>

<p>When the Air Force was looking at a replacement for its tanker fleet in the early 2000s, a <a href=""https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32910.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study was done</a> to determine what standard the new tanker should support.</p>

<p>Now relating the above points with the recent near vertical take off by Boeing 787-9 in the Paris air show 2015</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eax6x.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is this near vertical take off is an example that <code>Boeing aircraft leave ultimate control mostly to the pilot?</code>? If Airbus aircrafts trust autopilot more, would they allow this type of takeoff as it is done by pilot by pushing the engines to extreme? Also, is it some kind of mockery by Boeing to Airbus?</p>

<p>For those who haven't yet watched the video, below is the link</p>

","<p>No.</p>

<p>Firstly, as a comment noted, the takeoff was hardly ""near vertical"", the camera angle makes it look so. The takeoff angle in the video certainly is much steeper than a normal one, but Airbus aircraft are more than capable of doing the same - in fact an A350 did <a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/news/technology/paris-air-show-airbus-a350-xwb-performs-near-vertical-take-off-1.2249934"">very much the same thing</a> at the Paris Air Show. </p>

<p>The notion that an Airbus doesn't let the pilots have complete control is a little bit misleading. I'm not going to go into too much detail in this question, but what most people are referring to when they say that is the Alpha Protection system. This system kicks in when the aircraft is at extreme angles of attack. For example, if an aircraft is about to stall, it will not let the pilot pull the nose up. In any plausible situation the pilot would not want to raise the nose anyway, yet we have seen accidents such as <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgan_Air_Flight_3407"">Colgan 3407</a> where the pilot did exactly that (and, also <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447"">AF447</a>, however the system was disabled in that crash). </p>

<p>In summary, the Airbus system pretty much only prevents pilot actions that are dangerous (OK it is more complex than that, and the Boeing design has benefits too, but..). Back to your question, why does the Airbus system also allow such a steep takeoff? Because only the attitude was high, but the angle of attack was still within normal limits. These takeoffs are possible on lightly loaded aircraft with engines near full power.   </p>

"Which ATC instructions should be repeated back by the pilot?","9498","","<p>AIM 4-4-7 (b) says:</p>

  <p>Pilots of airborne aircraft should read back those parts of ATC

<p>As a student pilot soloing into class C airspace, on one flight ATC kept repeating everything back until I spoke it back to him. As I approached the airport he informed me of the bearing (12 o'clock) and distance to the airport until I acknowledged him (comms were pretty busy so I didn't initially repeat back his information).</p>

<p>Since then I've noticed that if I don't repeat back wake turbulence warnings verbatim they will repeat the warning until I do. With a traffic alert I repeat back immediately 'looking for traffic' because if I look first they'll keep repeating the warning.</p>

<p>Aside from AIM 4-4-7 is there any more specific guidance?</p>
","<p>ATC is, broadly speaking, required to ensure that pilots hear, understand, and acknowledge information that is delivered.  The way they do that is via read-backs, and although the AIM mentions a few of the things that are required it's a good idea to read back <em>anything that's important</em> (If you're not sure, err on the side of ""It's important""), with your aircraft callsign (No callsign?

<li><strong>Instructions to ""<em>Maintain visual separation with</em>"" some traffic</strong><br>

"How do hot air balloon pilots avoid collisions?","9481","","<p>There are many places in the world where hundreds of hot air balloons are flown in close proximity to each other. How do the pilots steer them away from each other to avoid mid-air collisions?</p>

<p>Wind blows all of them in one direction and I'm sure there are plenty of calculations done by these expert pilots prior to taking off, but I am also sure that not all the balloons will react to wind at exactly the same rate.</p>

<p>What happens when they are getting too close for comfort? Do they have horizontal movement control?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5RXni.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5RXni.jpg"" alt=""image: Adirondack Balloon Festival""></a>

<p>Ironically this image already has one collision in it on ground.</p>
","<p>I grew up in a family hot air ballooning business, and while I haven't been involved in a few years, I can answer your question in two words: <em>They don't!</em></p>

<h2>Taking Off</h2>

<p>As far as collisions go, the other answers have mostly addressed this: hot air balloons only control vertical movement, so with all the balloons experiencing the same wind, they'll move at approximately the same speed. </p>

<p>When taking off, we always angled the balloon so that the wind would blow from basket to envelope. In a large group, such as at festivals, we would maintain the same practice as much as possible, and have a line of balloons perpendicular to the direction of the wind. Often, this would restrict the space enough that inflating balloons would roll slightly into adjacent ones, but with a competent/strong person on the crown-line (the rope attached to the top of the balloon, used to maintain stability in the event of crosswind), the small gusts which caused localized rolling could be overcome. </p>

<p>In large groups, when a balloon is ready to lift off, the pilot will typically ensure nobody is going to be directly overhead, then apply more heat to lift out quickly. This prevents the basket from catching any of the envelopes of the balloons still on the ground. As mentioned, once in the air, collisions are not really a problem.</p>

<p>EDIT: I believe you can see two balloons on the ground but vertical which are pressed up against each other in the picture you've provided. Try looking near the middle, just to the top left. You can see that the envelopes are harmlessly pushing away from each other while the baskets are still quite far apart.</p>

<h2>In The Air</h2>

<p>Balloons are huge and move slowly, particularly slowly relative to each other. If two balloons are exactly level and one directly blocks the wind to the other when a gust comes, it's possible for one to suddenly gain speed. I've never seen gusts strong enough or long-lasting enough to create a speed difference of more than a couple miles per hour, so when the balloons do touch, the envelopes gently 'kiss,' then bounce back. This can, at worst, create a slow rocking of the basket. </p>

<p>Now, the last situation, if a pilot is unaware of another balloon directly overhead and starts going up, it could be a problem. However, pilots typically have radios and can communicate with each other if it's necessary. The pilot in the unseen balloon above would start applying heat to try to get out of the way as well as radio some (likely unkind) choice words to the pilot below him.</p>

<h2>Landing</h2>

<p>This is more of an after-thought, but if a pilot wants to land and another balloon is already there, the pilot will simply stay in the air a little longer to find another landing site. </p>

<h2>Competitions</h2>

<p>A second after-thought, but I know about 10+ years back there were a couple competitions at festivals where pilots would receive a special ribbon device and a partner-balloon. The device would mark the longest the ribbon had to extend. Each of the pilots would attach one end to their basket, then the duo who stayed the closest to each other would win a prize. </p>

<p>Another type of competition also occurred in which the pairs of pilots would take off about 15-30 minutes apart and the second pilot would have to try to land as close to the landing site of the first one as possible. Sometimes, this meant landing at roughly the same time and in uncomfortable proximity. Safety is always the first concern of a good pilot, though! If a pilot wasn't sure it could be done safely, he or she wouldn't do it!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As longwinded as this is, the gist of the answer is that balloon-balloon collisions aren't very serious unless the basket is involved. Typically, they move slowly enough to make it easy to avoid unwanted collisions, despite their lack of horizontal control.</p>

<p>The juicy bits are at 37:15' and at 43:35' into the video. Concerning the F-22 he says: Northrop built the F-23 exactly to what the Air Force asked for, while Lockheed built what the Air Force secretly wanted. And that was another F-15, with similar manoeuvrability.</p>

<p>Concerning the F-35 he says Lockheed's goal was to build an aircraft which is at least as good as an F-18 around the ship.

<p>Given that an A320's fuel burn rate is approximately 5.13 gallons per seat per hour, reducing this by 4% gives you 4.92 gallons/seat/hr.</p>

"Why is the landing area of an aircraft carrier angled to port side, not starboard?","9422","","<p>On a modern aircraft carrier, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_deck#Angled_flight_deck"">the landing area is not aligned with the axis of the ship</a>.</p>

<p>Given this part of the ship needs to be asymmetric, why do most (if not all) angled flight decks point to the left side of the ship (and not the right)? Is there any advantage to favor this side?</p>
","<p>Farhan's answer covered why the deck is angled in the first place. As far as why the landing area of the deck points left instead of right, this is for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Angling to port makes the most use of the deck area behind the catapults. Angling starboard would require the catapults to be shifted left off the centerline of the carrier (yes, the carrier does have two additional catapults on the port side, but these can't be used while the carrier is retrieving aircraft, which is more often than you'd think as the carrier maintains regular patrols).</p></li>
<li><p>Angling the landing strip toward the ""island"" (conning tower) of the carrier just doesn't sound like a good idea when you say it. That goes double when you realize the carrier is underway while you're trying to land on it, and therefore you have to lead the landing strip a little. If you don't, you'll end up ""behind"" the ship and the landing strip. With the landing strip angled to port, a plane on a ""lagging"" approach (lined up ""behind"" where the carrier's going to be at touchdown) will have a relatively clear path off to port for a wave-off. Angled to starboard, a plane that's ""lagging"" the carrier would be pointed right at the tower.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be possible to mirror the entire deck layout; island to port, landing area angled starboard. The reason the island is on the starboard side is primarily convention; all U.S. Navy aircraft carriers ever built have been either flush-decked or have had the island to the right. That's thus a familiar sight picture for naval pilots across all eras, and easy to train to. A new carrier design doesn't get the luxury of a whole new crew trained an entirely different way; the Navy's been training pilots since 1910, they've been landing planes on boats since 1927, and they'll do it they way they've been doing it for 88 years, thank you very much. </p>

<p>The Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned two carriers, <em>Akagi</em> and <em>Hiryu</em>, with island-left designs, fielded with the idea that the island-left carrier would sail in formation with an island-right carrier in the same flag group, with opposing traffic patterns that didn't conflict. This procedure never materialized in practice; most carrier groups in both Japanese and U.S. fleets ended up with a single carrier due to their high cost and lower total number, a pattern that continues today, and even when two (or more) carriers were close enough to be called part of the same naval group, they typically maintained a wide enough spacing to permit a left-hand pattern for both ships.</p></li>

It would be quite possible to look off to your right and think so you see an unidentified aircraft approaching, but be actually seeing some truck's lights on the hill a couple of miles away over your right shoulder. </p>

<p>Tilting the windows outwards means the reflection angle is towards the ceiling, which is generally painted black, and the effect goes away.</p>

<p>Further, tilting out means you can no longer see your own reflection, or reflections from other lit workstations in the window. Ever tried looking out of a window at night into the dark and only see your own ugly mug staring back at you, then tried to move your head to the side to see around yourself. LOL</p>

<p>Of course, for all this to work, the ceiling should be dark.</p>

<p>Is it still possible for a passenger to board a Jumbo Jet?<br>
Which airlines are still operating the B747 in 2018?</p>
","<p>There are still lots of 747's in scheduled passenger service and at least a few dozen of them will almost certainly remain so for the next 20+ years.</p>

<h2>747-400</h2>

<ul>
<li>British Airways has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways#Current_fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">36 of them</a> with retirement <a href=""https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/last-ba-747-400-to-leave-fleet-in-early-2024-442859/"" rel=""noreferrer"">scheduled for 2024</a>.</li>

<li>Qantas has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas#Fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">10 of them</a></li>
<li>China Airlines <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines#Current_Fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">still has some</a></li>
<li>El Al <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al#Current_fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">still flies them</a>, but is planning retirement in 2019.</li>
<li>Several others around the world</li>
</ul>

<p>There were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-400#Deliveries"" rel=""noreferrer"">deliveries of passenger 747-400s all the way up through 2005</a>, so the newest ones are only about 12-13 years old. The U.S. airlines, however, were among the first customers and had some of the oldest ones. In Delta's case, they literally had the oldest one, as Northwest (which Delta acquired several years ago) was the launch customer of the 747-400. So, while Delta and United's 747s were mostly over 20 years old (some over 25,) many other customers operate much newer ones.</p>

<h2>747-8I</h2>

<p>While the 747-400s are on their way out, the 747-8Is are mostly only a few years old and should still be flying for decades. These are currently flown by 3 airlines in scheduled passenger service, as well as several others in charter and/or VIP service.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lufthansa has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa#Current_fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">19 of them</a></li>
<li>Korean Air has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air#Current_fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">10 of them</a></li>
<li>Air China has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_China#Current"" rel=""noreferrer"">7 of them</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While the Delta 747-400s with their lovely 14-seat 1-1 business-class configuration upstairs are unfortunately no more, if you're looking to ride upstairs on a 747, my personal recommendation would be Korean Air's 747-8s.</p>

<h2>Other Commercial Operations</h2>

<p>There are <em>lots</em> of 747s in cargo service and this doesn't appear likely to change any time soon. The 747-8F is still in production and has accounted for almost all of the recent new 747 orders. It appears that it will remain in production for at least the next few years and possibly quite a bit longer than that. UPS ordered 14 of them a little over a year ago, so that will keep the line going for at least a couple more years by itself.</p>

<p>Aside from the numerous 747-400 cargo and charter operators, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-8#Orders_and_deliveries"" rel=""noreferrer"">the following operators all fly the 747-8F</a> and, so, will likely continue flying it for a couple more decades:</p>

<ul>
<li>UPS (14)</li>
<li>AirBridgeCargo (7)</li>
<li>Silk Way Airlines (5)</li>
<li>Saudi Cargo (5)</li>
<li>Korean Air Cargo (7) (in addition to the 10 747-8Is operated by Korean Air)</li>
<li>Cathay Pacific Cargo (14)</li>
<li>Volga-Dnepr Airlines (5)</li>
<li>Atlas Air (10)</li>
<li>Nippon Cargo Airlines (8)</li>
<li>Cargolux (14)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, 8 747-8Is are being operated as business jets or VIP jets, not counting the 2 recently purchased by the U.S. Air Force for use as the next Air Force One fleet. If the past is any indication, the Air Force One 747-8s will likely still be in regular service (though technically not commercial service) even longer than most of the other recent 747 deliveries, due to the relatively low number of flight cycles that they get. They could possibly remain in service 30 years from now or more. For comparison, the current Air Force One fleet is composed of modified 747-200s, which have long been retired from airline service.</p>

"How to get registration from ICAO 24 bit code?","9329","","<p>The description of PlanePlotter claims that it can determine the registration letters from the ICAO 24 bit address algorithmically for some countries.</p>

<p>The only thing i got so far is how to get the country. Any clues?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>After some more research I found some information in the book ""Principles of Avionics"" by Albert Helfrick: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, there is no algorithm giving a one-to-one correspondence
  between ICAO 24 bit addresses and the registration number of the
  aircraft. Some ICAO member states did have an algorithm that would
  translate ICAO 24 bit aircraft addresses to registration numbers but
  ICAO strongly suggested the practice to stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Algorithm for swedish registrations: <a href=""http://www.transportstyrelsen.se/publicdocuments/PDF165.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transportstyrelsen.se/publicdocuments/PDF165.pdf</a></p>
","<p>Apparently (according to <a href=""http://www.gatwickaviationsociety.org.uk/modeslookup.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">these folks</a>) some countries use an algorithm to generate their ICAO (Mode S) 24-bit IDs. For those countries, you can simply reverse the algorithm and get a registration given the Mode S ID.</p>

<p>Others countries allow you to download their registration database, complete with the Mode S identifier (<a href=""http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/"" rel=""nofollow"">you can get the US registration database here</a>) - it's a simple matter to load this into your own software and map the ICAO/Mode S ID code to a registration number.</p>

<p>As the folks at Gatwick Aviation Society have noted, some countries are tight-lipped about how their codes are assigned (and who they're assigned to), so these lookups are probably not complete.</p>

"Why/when is the blunt nose better?","9326","","<p>Most large aircraft and some fighters have blunt, rounded nose cone. OTOH many fighters (that don't use the nose for air intake) and notably the two supersonic airliners (Concorde, TU-144) have the sharp tip for a nose cone.</p>

<p>What is the aerodynamic justification for that? What advantages and disadvantages does the ""blunt"" nose cone provide - or why don't all airplanes have the sharp spike nose cone (which ""feels"" like the obviously optimal aerodynamic choice - obviously that ""feel"" is somehow flawed?)</p>
","<p>In <strong>subsonic</strong> flow the air can react to the approaching vehicle since the pressure field around it extends forward, too. This means that a suction area on one side of the fuselage or wing will already start to pull molecules in before they reach the vehicle itself which causes this suction. A round nose allows the flow to come from a range of angles without creating too much drag. Aerodynamically speaking, the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9955/can-a-steady-flow-have-stagnation-points/9958?s=2%7C0.3420#9958"">stagnation point</a> can be moved without problems.</p>

<p>In <strong>supersonic</strong> flow, the air has no indication of the approaching vehicle. The first contact will cause a sudden change in direction, called a shock. For drag reduction it is important to make the shock as weak as possible, which means that the change in direction should be as small as possible. This can best be achieved by a slender, pointy tip.</p>

<p>Note the downward position of the intake cone of the SR-71 engine nacelle in the picture below: It is angled so that at Mach 3.2 the cone is symmetrical to the oncoming flow (which gives you a pretty good indication of the angle of attack of the whole plane).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VFp5q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VFp5q.jpg"" alt=""SR-71 during take-off""></a></p>

Not only is the cone angled downward, but also canted in because the flow is pressed sideways by the aircraft's forebody in supersonic flight.</p>

<p>In <strong>hypersonic flow</strong> (Mach > 5) a blunt nose might again be preferable if the nose's materials put an upper limit on aerodynamic heating. A pointed tip will produce an attached shock which will heat the tip to something close to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_temperature"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stagnation temperature</a> of the flow. A blunt nose, however, will cause a separated shock. This creates more drag and higher heat loads overall, but allows to spread the heat over a larger area and produces lower peak loads. The Space Shuttle had such a blunt nose, since drag minimization is not a priority for a re-entry vehicle.</p>

"Why has the folding wing option of the Boeing 777 never been ordered?","9315","","<p>The Boeing 777 has an optional folding wing mechanism to fit into tighter spaces, but it has never been ordered by airlines, according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>. Why is this option so unpopular?</p>

<p>Now with the Boeing 777X, Boeing is again offering a smaller, less complex wing folding option. Has this been ordered, and are other airliner models planned to incorporate folding wingtips?</p>
","<p>The folding wingtips are found mostly in naval aviation. The reason is the space constraint inside the hangar of the aircraft carrier.</p>

Curtis. </p>

<p>As can be seen from the photo, folding the wings offers the only practical way of fitting fighter aircraft inside the cramped hangar space. For example, the F/A-18C/D had a wing span of 11.43m; this was reduced to 8.38m with the wings folded, a 26% reduction.</p>

<p>However, the price to pay is increase in complexity, weight, price and increased maintenance. The figure shows the wing folding mechanism of a F 18.</p>

Source:polepositionimagery.com.au</p>

<p>The major drawbacks of folding wings are,</p>

<ol>
<li>The increased weight and complexity due to the folding mechanism. The folding mechanism takes time to operate and there are safety concerns if they get stuck in a position.</li>
<li>The folding of wings limits the fuel capacity and as a result, the range of the aircraft, as fuel is usually not carried on the folding part of the wings.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPbCb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPbCb.jpg"" alt=""F-18 Overview""></a></p>

<p>Source: zarco-macross.wikidot.com</p>

<p>As can be seen, the F/A doesn't carry fuel in the folding part of the wing. In fact, after the airlines didn't take up its folding concept in 777, Boeing added fuel tanks to that area and increased range of 777-200/300. </p>

<p>There has previously been no reason for airliners to fold their wings, as airports offered enough space for operations and ground movement. However, as the size of aircraft and their aspect ratios grow (to reduce drag), designers are finding it more and more difficult to keep the wingspan below the 80m 'box' which airlines believe is the maximum they can cope up economically.</p>

<p>The first major program to be affected by this limitation was the A380, which limited the wingspan of the aircraft to less than 80m and reduced its aspect ratio.  </p>

<p>Basically, Boeing is facing the same problem. The proposed 777x is the aircraft with largest wingspan Boeing has ever produced. However, in case of A380, Airbus managed to reduce induced drag through the use of wingtip fences, among other design decisions. 777x is expected to have a raked wingtip, which is not as space effective as the wingtip fence. </p>

<p>Source: Flightglobal.com</p>

<p>As a result, Boeing is considering folding wingtips. However, there are important differences between the original plan in 777 and the proposed plan in 777x.</p>

<p>In the original plan, Boeing proposed to fold 21' of the wingtip. However,the new plans call for folding only 10'.</p>

<p>Image:Boeing</p>

<p>As can be seen from the figure, the folding plan is much more modest. This is not expected to have the drawbacks associated with the the original plan, as,</p>

<ul>
<li>The end of the wing will not house controls</li>
<li>As the size of the wing to be folded is smaller, the folding mechanism will not be as heavy and complicated.</li>
<li>That part probably not carry fuel</li>
<li>Advances in actuation systems since the 777 will reduce the weight penalty</li>
</ul>

<p>To put things into perspective, the 747-400 winglets were 6' feet tall. </p>

<p>Airlines have already placed orders for 777x and it is their operational record that will determine if other aviation manufacturers (Airbus, that is.) will follow suit.</p>

"Why is port-starboard terminology used in aviation?","9302","","<p><sub><sup>I am not a pilot - just a student &amp; play Ace Combat sometimes</sup></sub></p>

<p>Intrigued by the words Starboard &amp; Port-side I researched why these words are used instead of the simple ones, I found that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Port is derived from the practice of sailors mooring ships on the left side at ports in order to prevent the steering oar from being crushed. <sub><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard"" rel=""noreferrer"">src</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, quite notably:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since port and starboard never change, they are unambiguous references that are independent of a mariner’s orientation, and, thus, mariners use these nautical terms instead of left and right to avoid confusion. When looking forward, toward the bow of a ship, port and starboard refer to the left and right sides, respectively.<sub><a href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/port-starboard.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">src</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see both the reasons are derived upon the concerns of the marine world - so why do we use them in aviation world?</p>

<p>This is specially interesting if we consider the fact that flying machines can manevur in all 3D, newbies (me) tend loose track of <em>my VS. plane's</em> left &amp; right when not in level flight. Then why the added confusion?</p>
","<p><strong>It isn't</strong> (much).</p>

<p>Ships are the most similar thing to aircraft that existed before them, so it made sense that aviation took over many terms and conventions from seafaring (the pilot in command is called <em>captain</em>, the <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit_%28sailing%29"">cockpit</a></em> is the flight <em>deck</em>, distances and speeds are given in <em>nautical miles</em> and <em>knots</em> etc.)</p>

<p>However since there is no physical port in an aircraft to serve as reference (most aircraft have doors on <em>both</em> sides), everybody has to learn to give the sides relative to the direction of flight and then it does not make sense to teach them new words when they already know “left” and “right”. So “port” and “starboard” are only used where there is a naval tradition.</p>

<p>I know British military aviation (RAF) used it (in wartime stories and documents it is common, but according to Simon's comment it is not common any more) and the US Navy uses it with ships, but I don't know to what extent they apply it to aircraft. </p>

<p>However, it remains popular in simulator games, presumably because it is catchy and unusual and using jargon makes people feel special.</p>

"which is the difference between Line-replaceable unit(LRU) and Integrated Modular Avionic (IMA)?","9267","","<p>I'm studying the Integrated Modular Avionic(IMA) and Line-replaceable unit(LRU), but I don't get the difference. </p>
","<p>A Line Replaceable Unit is a piece of hardware that can be exchanged for a replacement part in a relatively short time by only opening and closing fasteners and connectors. You will find the term LRU in avionics but also in ATC hardware. Examples are FMC, transponder, etc.</p>

<p>When you have a complex avionics system you tend to end up with a great variety of LRUs. All these LRU have a very specific function. To be able to quickly replace malfunctioning parts, maintenance needs to keep a large stock of spares for all these LRU's. </p>

<p>The Integrated Modular Avionics concept attempts to reduce the variety of LRU's by designing the avionics with common components. E.g. one type of power supply, one type of memory unit, one type of processing board and only a few variations of input/output modules. This reduces the number of replacement parts needed to be kept on stock. The LRUs of IMA have more generic functions than in a traditional avionics system.</p>

What can a passenger do?","9258","","<p><em>There is <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8986"">another question</a> about airliners and if someone not qualified could land them. My question is about the steps I should take to stay alive in a small GA plane.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Let say a friend of mine invites me aboard a small aircraft (like Cessna 172 or equivalent).<br>
At some point my pilot friend passes out for some reason. What should I do considering the following:  </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not a pilot.</li>
<li>I'm seated in the co-pilot seat.</li>
<li>I spent hundreds of hours on Flight Simulator (a few years ago).</li>
<li>I've been initiated to fly a small aircraft (1 session covering the very basics), but no take-off/landing exercises.</li>
<li>The weather is good.</li>
<li>Aircraft is in good condition.</li>
<li>The tank is full.</li>
<li>Area has ATC and I know how to operate the radio.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
This is my guess:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hold the plane's level and heading</li>
<li>Slap my friend to try to wake him up</li>
<li>Send ""Mayday"" asking for assistance and technical guidance</li>
<li>Try to follow ATC instructions as well as I can</li>
</ol>

<p>Does this look good? What should be done differently?  </p>
","<p>Best case scenario: You're straight and level, on frequency with some form of human being, there's no immediate danger and you have the know-how to transmit. In that case, that human will provide you with everything they possibly can to help you. Most important thing for you to do is keep the aircraft away from clouds, away from terrain and not panic. You'll probably be in an aircraft that is more-or-less easy to fly in this situation. Most GA aircraft are quite stable and will not be a beast to control.</p>

<p>Once talking to ATC they will tell you to set your transponder to a number. You should find somewhere a 4-digit readout with a knob below/above each digit. Set the number indicated to help ATC identify you easily.</p>

<p>Otherwise, look around you for big landmarks (Mountains, Lakes, even a large Church/Cathedral) as one of the first things ATC will want to do is work out where you are.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's best case; let's look at some alternatives. </p>

<p><em>You're out of range of the tuned frequency on the radio, or there is no response</em>: </p>

<p>Tune 121.5MHz, this is the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/809/is-there-a-dedicated-emergency-frequency"">emergency frequency</a>. Someone will be monitoring this channel and be able to give you further advice - if nothing else a local ATC channel to tune. Failing this see if your pilot has a chart handy, he may have drawn his intended route on it - look along that route for anything that looks like a frequency to tune into the radio.</p>

<p><em>Aircraft is climbing, or descending</em>:</p>

<p>Get the aircraft into safe, level flight. Remember controls work in the opposite sense to what you might expect (probably not if you've ever played any flight simulator). If the engine is roaring reduce power slightly. If you appear to be losing altitude with the nose on the horizon increase power slightly. Do everything with tiny incremental changes. Try not to fiddle too much with controls, only what is necessary.</p>

<p><em>Aircraft is heading directly for a cloud/out to the sea/towards a heavily built up area/a big airport</em>:</p>

<p>Turn 180 degrees - don't try to turn too quickly, it should take roughly 30 seconds to 1 minute to complete this turn.</p>

"What prevents a passenger from opening the emergency door on his own will, mid-flight?","9224","","<p>I have never sat on the emergency seats near the wings, with the emergency exit. I have seen cabin crew instruct the passengers seated near the door on how to operate the door.</p>

<p>My question, what prevents a 'rogue' passenger from opening them mid-flight?</p>
","<p>At cruising altitude there is between 4 and 8 tons of pressure acting on the inside of the door. There aren't too many passengers capable of exerting that much force on the handle (and even fewer handles that won't just snap off). Latch type doors have interlocks or over-center latches that prevent operation with a pressurized cabin.</p>

<p>It's theoretically possible to open the over-wing exits at approach altitudes when there is no pressure differential. Other than being windy/noisy it would not affect the flight in any way. Cabin doors usually open forward, good luck pushing them open against the airflow. If the person who pulled the window plug wants out, it's their (and only their) funeral. I've sat in the open doors of light aircraft in flight hundreds of times, legs in the breeze, no seatbelt, while the plane makes fairly steep turns toward the open door side. It's not a problem. </p>

"Do helicopters have an auto hover system?","9183","","<p>I'm not a helicopter pilot. The way I understand it, helicopter pilots have to constantly make small adjustments to make a helicopter hover steadily at a certain point in space, just like fixed wing pilots flying in close formations.</p>

<p>Are there any systems which, when engaged, will measure the helicopter's movement with gyroscopes and accelerometers, and automatically compensate for small deviations?</p>
","<p>Yes, advanced flight directors and autopilots for helicopters can control the aircraft in all axes, and often they have modes for hovering built in, including maintain altitude, lateral veloctiy hold, hover, and/or autolevel. </p>

<p>Hovering is difficult because it requires more complex controls than maintaining altitude in an airplane.  Helicopters have a different set of control axes than fixed-wing aircraft.  Fixed wing aircraft are controlled in pitch, roll, and yaw, with thrust as an extra variable.  On a helicopter the flight path is controlled through cyclic (roll and pitch), collective, and throttle, with the anti-torque pedals as well to control yaw.  Hovering the aircraft requires controlling of the cyclic to keep the aircraft over its target with no lateral movement, and collective and throttle to maintain constant altitude, although the exact procedures are a little more complex. </p>

<p>While not present on low-end helicopters due to a combination of complexity and lack of necessity, advanced autopilots for helicopters do exist.  Like on other aircraft, there is a wide variety in autopilots between simple functions to maintain attitude (often called one or two-cue guidance depending on the number of axes used) to complex FMS-integrated three-axis modes (which would be ""three-cue"" guidance). The FAA <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/helicopter_flying_handbook/"">Helicopter Flying Handbook</a> states, for example, that  ""The most advanced autopilots can fly an instrument approach to a hover without
any additional pilot input once the initial functions have
been selected.""  </p>

<p>On the Agusta AW139 helicopter that I'm familiar with (although I'm not a pilot), they have several modes that provide this functionality:  </p>

<ul>
<li>an altitude mode to maintain a given altitude </li>
<li>an altitude acquire mode to smoothly reach a desired altitude</li>
<li>an autolevel mode to level off at the end of an approach segment</li>
<li>a lateral velocity hold mode to maintain slow lateral motion or no lateral motion</li>
<li>more exotic search and rescue modes providing capabilites to transition to a hover, mark-on-target descents to predefined altitutdes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>A traditional hover would be achieved by combining a low lateral velocity mode with a zero vertical speed mode like altitude or autolevel.</p>

"Does weight and balance of an airplane matter more on takeoff?","9125","","<p>On a few international flights with non-full cabin, the crew has asked no one to move to open seats until the plane has finished take-off. I assumed this was just to force people to sit down during take-off and not cause problems, but when I asked I was told it was because of weight. The claim is, the airplane is balanced by where people are sitting. The next claim is by the end of the flight, there is less fuel, so if people have switched seats there is less of a problem. This weight balance apparently uses all information, people, baggage, and fuel.</p>

<p>I believed this, until recently a plane had lost at least 30 peoples baggage, some people had more than 1 bag. The bags were left at the previous airport, and on arrival no one knew that the bags were not on the plane.  </p>

<p>If the lack of knowledge for bags not being on the plane (which seems logical, why would they depart without the bags), how did this change in weight not show in the take-off, or was this a dangerous occurrence?</p>
","<p>By regulation, a ""weight &amp; balance"" must be computed before departure to ensure that the weight is within the weight limits for a number of different conditions and that the weight is distributed such that the c.g. (center of gravity) of the airplane is also within the longitudinal c.g. limits for those conditions. That c.g. is typically computed assuming the the passengers are in the seats they have been assigned. If the passengers are seated elsewhere, the computed c.g. is not accurate. In other words, the pilots wouldn't know where the c.g. is or whether it is even within limits.</p>

<p>The takeoff trim setting is affected by the c.g. If the pilots set the trim according to the computed value, and the c.g. is considerably aft of that, on liftoff the nose is going to want to pitch up more than the pilots expect. If the c.g. is so far aft that it is well beyond the aft limits, serious control problems can occur. If the c.g. is far forward of what the pilots are expecting, they're going to have to pull harder on the elevator control than expected to get the aircraft to rotate, and that is going to extend the takeoff roll.</p>

<p>Different makes of aircraft vary widely in c.g. limitations and how tolerant they are limit wise of passenger placement in aircraft that are not full. For example, when I was flying Metroliners, if you had few passengers, you had to ask them to sit toward the rear. I once got a strange look from Rosey Grier (Google him if you don't know who he is) when I had to ask him to sit in the back of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Once you're in the air, the movement of passengers is of lesser concern balance wise. You're at speed, the elevator is fully effective, and the pilots or the autopilot keep the airplane in trim. In other words, the trim is what it is rather than a computed value that might not reflect reality.</p>

<p>Also, on large aircraft, once you're in the air in level flight and if you're so inclined, you can work out your weight by using your fuel flow, pressure altitude, and airspeed. Then with the weight and your trim setting you can come up with your c.g. I would guess that most of the glass cockpit aircraft probably do that for you automatically if you request it. My experience stopped with the 747-200, which is now a near relic.</p>

<p>The c.g. limits are defined conservatively, and usually in terms of the percent of the mean aerodynamic chord. It's not a case of that if the aft c.g. limit is 33% mac (a common value for 747s) and you're at 33.1% you're going to crash. It's just a case that you're beginning to move into an area that gives you a lesser degree of controllability than is deemed necessary for some situations. Continued movement to an extreme value would eventually make the aircraft uncontrollable.</p>

<p>Insofar as the bags-left-behind part of the question, I don't think their absence would cause a problem. If the computed c.g. including the bags was right right up against the aft c.g. limit, their absence could conceivably put the c.g. beyond the aft limit. The pilots might notice it, but handling it would not be difficult. However, aircraft are typically not loaded such that their c.g. is close to a limit. A preferred aiming point for 747-100s, -200s, and -400s is 26.6% mac.</p>

<p>Just for the heck of it, I did a weight &amp; balance for a 747-400, loading it so that the takeoff c.g. was 26.6% mac. I then took 5000 lbs (100 bags x 50 lbs each) out of the most forward baggage area. This changed the the c.g. to 28.0% mac, still within limits. On the 747, a given weight of baggage misplacement has less potential to affect the c.g. than the same weight of passenger misplacement because the passenger seating extends over 20 feet forward of the most forward baggage compartment and over 17 feet aft of the most aft baggage compartment.</p>

"Why do solar planes have many small propellers instead of fewer large ones?","9112","","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sxq4R.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sxq4R.jpg"" alt=""NASA Helios""></a></p>

<p>Many solar planes, like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Prototype"" rel=""noreferrer"">NASA's Helios</a> (pictured above), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Pathfinder"" rel=""noreferrer"">NASA's Pathfinder</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/the-technology-behind-aquila/10153916136506634/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Facebook's Aquila</a> employ the use of many small motor propeller sets instead of one or two engines like most planes. Why is this?</p>

<p>Smaller motors tend to have slightly higher power density, but aren't the relative losses higher on the smaller airfoils of these propellers?</p>
","<p>Because they are very lightweight and fragile. Therefore, thrust and propulsion mass must be distributed over span - a single, large propeller and motor would put too much force into the structure locally. Also, it would require a higher landing gear to give the larger propeller the required clearance.</p>

<p>You are right about the higher losses. However, these airplanes were built to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7691/how-high-can-propeller-airplanes-fly/7693#7693"">reach record altitudes</a>, and wing loading must be as small as possible to make that possible. Also, boundary layer problems on propellers are less severe than on wings because the rotation will cause the slowed boundary layer to be moved outwards from centrifugal forces. There the blade moves faster which will very effectively suppress flow separation.</p>

"How can an airliner make up for time lost?","9077","","<p>If a plane has been delayed at the origin how does it make up for the lost time? Does the pilot need any special permission from ATC to increase the speed so that it can cover the lost time or has the pilot the power to make such kind of decisions?</p>
","<p>According to ICAO Annex II (Rules of the air) 3.6.2.2(b):</p>

  <p>Variation in true airspeed: if the average true airspeed at cruising
  level between reporting points varies or is expected to vary by plus
  or minus 5 per cent of the true airspeed, from that given in the
  flight plan, the appropriate air traffic services unit shall be so
  informed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the pilot in command has the right to increase speed, just as well as the air traffic controller has the right to limit it. However, as airliners normally cruise fairly close to their maximum speeds, this isn’t very effective. Recovering lost time by increasing speed is at best 1 to 3 minutes per hour.<br>
Better ways are to request possible shortcuts from ATC and change altitude for better wind and temperature.</p>

I haven't really paid attention to it's behavior in the aircraft (only checking that it's in the green), and I just looked at it in Xplane right now which might be wrong of course.</p>

<p>Is it showing the negative difference to ambient pressure? Or the difference in pressure before and after the vacuum pump (which may or may not be the same thing)? Or something else completely? :)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uC3Vx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The pressure difference between the ambient and the vacuum line drives the airflow which spins the gyros in you instruments. In the Socata design, there is an implicit assumption that the air filter is not blocked. If the filter would be blocked, the suction gauge would probably exceed the green area unless the vacuum relief valve opens before the red is reached. </p>

<p>If your vacuum pump stops working, the dial will fall to its lower stop. If the air filter is blocked, and both the vacuum pump and the vacuum relief valve working properly, the dial should exceed 5 inHg.</p>

<hr>

<p>Other designs are a bit more fault tolerant in the sense that they do not make any assumptions on the working of the filter or the relief valve. In the examples below (thanks to voretaq7) the suction gauge indicates the pressure difference over the instrument itself, which is a more robust presentation of how the system is performing. </p>

"Why do planes have cross-feed switches or circuits?","9050","","<p>Why do planes have cross-feed switches or circuits? Are they to move contents of one tank to another (feed the tank) or to supply the engine with fuel from left side to right or vice versa (feed the engine)?</p>
","<p>The fuel system in aircraft generally includes a left and right tank within the corresponding wings. Each tank generally provides fuel to the engines on that wing. The crossfeed valve is used to temporarily connect the two sides of the system. This system allows the shortest route for the fuel and keeps the systems separate, so a leak on one side cannot drain the entire system. The crossfeed valve is generally kept shut for this reason. A couple scenarios illustrate when opening the valve might be necessary.</p>

<p>To keep the plane balanced, both wing tanks should have about the same amount of fuel. However, for various reasons, they could become unbalanced. The crossfeed valve allows fuel to flow from the tank with too much fuel to the tank with less fuel.</p>

<p>Another scenario would be the loss of an engine. In a twin-engine airplane, the remaining engine would need to be able to draw fuel from both wing tanks.</p>

<p>Note: especially in larger aircraft, fuel systems can be much more complicated, with multiple tanks in each wing and also in the fuselage. Fuel transfer also becomes more complicated.</p>

<p>Using the 737 as an example, this is the fuel system control panel with the crossfeed switch in the center. With the crossfeed valve open, turning off the fuel pumps on one tank will cause more fuel to be drawn from the tanks on the other side.</p>

"What is the difference between a crabbed and de-crab landing?","9021","","<p>Both landings are done when an airplane's nose is not in inline with the runway. How are these two different? when should one technique be preferred over other?</p>
","<p>Consider where the center of gravity is in relation to the main wheels. If you are in a tail dragger, you definitely would prefer to de-crab (never heard that term before now) before touching down. If you touched down while crabbed, you'd have a moment created by the center of gravity around the main gear to ground loop the airplane.</p>

<p>In a tricycle gear airplane, that same moment would work to straighten the airplane since the center of gravity is forward of the main gear.</p>

<p>In a crosswind from the right, for example, when you apply left rudder to align the aircraft with the runway, the right wing will want to come up (you just gave it a little extra speed), so you will want to use right aileron to at least counter that as you certainly don't want the crosswind component to get 'under' the wing.</p>

<p>Both 747 operators I flew for recommended touching down in the crab. Personally I didn't like that and used a combination approach in a heavy crosswind, take out some of the crab but not all. Also, while they did caution against lowering the upwind wing, I always lowered the wing a little. I once figured out how much the wing would have to be lowered before ground contact, and it was quite substantial, more than I would ever think of using. Also, as I remember, It would not be the wingtip or an outboard engine pod that would make first contact, but rather the outboard corner of the outboard wing flap when set to flaps 30.</p>

<p>Finally, when your touch down speed is 140 knots, for example, you'll have to crab much less for a given crosswind component than if your touchdown speed is 70 knots. Cosine or tangent of the angle, I forget which.</p>

There are <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.0733.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more efficient strategies (.pdf)</a> which <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5211"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have been proven</a> to speed up boarding by between 20% and 50%, still they are not adopted. Why?</p>

<p>You need to load the baggage, too. Also the catering. And fuel. You need to inspect the aircraft, run through checklists and brief the new crew. This all takes up time, too. Airlines do not see a big saving by loading passengers faster, and then waiting for all other jobs to be completed.</p>

<p>Your radical idea of containerizing passenger transport would certainly speed up things, but it would cost a lot of payload.</p>

<ol>
<li>The most efficient pressure vessel is a sphere, and the next efficient is a cylinder with spherical ends. Pressurizing a boxy container is structurally very inefficient.</li>
<li>Loading passengers on palettes first and sliding those palettes through a narrow opening takes time in itself. And the palettes have their own weight, their own floor, their own support structure for the baggage racks, their own cabeling for the entertainment system. They would, however, not need their independent pressurization, so their weight impact would be moderate.</li>
<li>A possible ""flatbed"" airliner which could attain the shortest boarding times has only half as much fuselage height (or less) to transmit bending loads along its length. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9917/why-does-the-757-fuselage-bend-more-on-turbulence-than-those-of-other-airplanes"">See here</a> for an example of buckling in a fuselage skin due to bending loads. Now consider that reducing height by 50% will need four times more cross section in the longerons to keep stiffness constant. That will make the fuselage much heavier.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, airlines go with the solution which maximizes their profits. By using a hollow cylinder and let their ""cargo"" self-load, they can maximize their payload and get tolerable boarding times. Tolerable for them, that is. That better loading procedures could allow you to come to the airport later is of no interest to them. If they would see an advantage in shorter boarding times, there would be ample of opportunity by improving strategies, even with existing airplane designs.</p>

"Who decides what measurement units are used for altitude, and why is there no standard?","8896","","<p>I know that some countries (Russia and China for instance) use meters to measure altitude while the rest of the world uses feet. Why isn't this standardized around the world? </p>

<p>I guess all modern cockpit instruments nowdays offer both unit system measurements, but this must be creating some confusion for pilots.</p>

<p>Who decides which measurement units should be used for aircraft altitude? The airlines? ATC? Each country?</p>

<p>Why are both units of measure used?  Are there any pros or cons with using meters?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, countries tend to want to decide themselves how stuff is supposed to work once you're within their borders. That's why we have different rules and laws, and when you go somewhere else in the world, you might need to know some of the differences.</p>

<p>In England they drive on the wrong side of the road, imagine that! :)</p>

<p>Anyways, in order to have things run smoothly in something so utterly international as aviation, there's this organization called <a href=""http://www.icao.int"">ICAO</a> (International Civil Aviation Organization) where I believe most countries of the world are members, where the rules are that the ICAO drafts recommendations (I believe they are called) which the member states should incorporate into their respective laws and regulations. If they choose not to, they need to inform the ICAO of such deviation, don't know exactly what happens then, but I believe the idea is to at least let everybody know there's a discrepancy.</p>

<p>Anyway, the ICAO Annex 5 specifies units to use, including units for altitude and actually specifying <strong>meters</strong> as the primary unit, with feet being accepted as non-SI alternative. Why on earth you'd want to go against the majority on this I don't know, perhaps due to the fact that it's an SI unit and they want to be as much SI as they can. So it's basically up to each country how they want to play it. Most countries stuck with feet.</p>

"Why does ATC ask a crew who has declared an emergency if their aircraft will be overweight when landing?","8874","","<p>I have heard ATC ask an emergency aircraft if they will be overweight when landing.<br>
Why do they ask?
I am not asking about the consequences of an overweight landing or what procedures are required following one, but rather why ATC would ask for this in advance of the landing.</p>

<p>E.G. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does ATC take it into account when offering a runway?</li>
<li>Does passing it on to emergency services somehow allow them to be better prepared than if they were informed after the fact?</li>
</ul>
","<p>If an aircraft encounters a serious problem quite soon after departure that forces it to land immediately, the aircraft may be above its certified maximum landing weight. This is because there is still a lot of fuel in the tanks, which adds a lot of weight.</p>

<p>As @RonBeyer mentioned in a comment, landing overweight can have a number of serious consequences. When landing a heavy aircraft, stopping it on the runway already requires a lot of energy (or rather, a lot of energy needs to be converted into something else). If the aircraft is heavier than it is designed to be on landing, this may cause excessive stress on the brakes. In extreme cases, this can make the brakes catch fire. Now, open flames under an aircraft that is almost fully loaded with fuel is the recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>In some cases, even though the crew brakes hard on landing, the aircraft may be so heavy that stopping on the runway is impossible. A runway excursion will then follow (a situation where the aircraft leaves the runway onto the grass or similar). This is not neccesarily dangerous, but it certainly can be, depending on the surrounding terrain:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4gY45.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4gY45.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(image from <a href=""http://avherald.com/h?article=46f3d531"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://avherald.com/h?article=46f3d531</a>. This aircraft was not overweight, but I still think the situation shown in the picture is relevant to this question.)</p>

<p>Obviously, in an emergency ATC, and in turn the fire and rescue crew at the airport, need to be prepared for such events. If ATC expects an aircraft will be landing overweight, getting the crew to confirm this will allow ATC to inform the fire crew that they can expect brake fires or a potential runway excursion. It can also enable the rescue leader to position the fire vehicles at the best possible position, which would be further down the runway than normal, since the landing roll will be longer. So basically, it's a way to get information to the rescue crew so that they can prepare for what might be coming.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of emergency, ATC will also ask the crew about other details, in some cases also with the purpose of passing this information on to the rescue crew, since the rescue crew will normally not be in direct contact with the cockpit as long as the plane is in the air.

"Why do some airlines operate fleets so diversified?","8849","","<p>When you have a look at the fleets from big airlines like United, Delta, Lufthansa, BA, AF, etc. it seems that they have almost every model Boeing and Airbus released in their fleet. And my question is, why?</p>

<p>What I assume is that such a big variety would increase the costs for maintenance, training, etc.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, why use the A330 as well as the 777? Why operate both the A320 and 737?</p>

<p>For me as a passenger it is comfortable because I like to test and review different aircraft; but for these airlines' Operations divisions it must be horrible!</p>

<p>I know there are probably reasons to do so otherwise they would not have this variety. What are these reasons?</p>
","<p>There are two philosophies for fleet selection:</p>

<ol>
<li>One type / model or one manufacturer approach</li>
<li>Multi manufacturer divide and conquer approach</li>
</ol>

<p>First of all, a single model fleet is only possible for airlines that operate on sectors of comparable length. You can't do intercontinental and regional flights with the same aircraft model efficiently.</p>

<p>As you observe, there are obviously costs associated with flying different types of aircraft. A single type fleet like for example Ryanair (B738), Southwest (B73*) and Easyjet (A320 family) operate, means the cost of maintenance, training, etc can be kept low. Adding a few aircraft of another type to the fleet would mean additional tools in stock, diversified training and a separate flight crew group and lots of other cost factors. </p>

<p>Aircraft manufacturers know that too. So if you need another 10 - 20 aircraft, your standard supplier will ask a high price for this fleet extension, knowing that the competition is never able to put in a compelling offer when all additional cost are taken into account. Only if the batch size is large enough the competitor might be able to offset the additional costs with a unit discount.</p>

<p>That is where the mixed fleet operator has an advantage. Since the additional overhead costs of a couple extra aircraft from type A or B are minimal, they <a href=""http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/routes-emirates-to-re-evaluate-a350-alongside-787-next-404005/"">have a better position</a> while negotiating with the manufacturers. </p>

<p>Single manufacturer airlines usually order aircraft in <a href=""http://corporate.ryanair.com/news/news/14908-ryanair-places-order-for-up-to-200-new-boeing-737-max-200-aircraft-worth-up-to-22bn/?market=en"">large numbers</a>, otherwise they would not get a proper deal; multi type airlines can order aircraft in lower numbers. </p>

<hr>

<p>And then there are politics. Sometimes a national airline will be subjected to political pressure to buy from a certain manufacturer. This is especially the case for airlines operating in the international / intercontinental market. The extra fleet cost incurred will be (partially) offset by deals in another field.</p>

In practice, no planes are scheduled to arrive or depart in this missing hour, and since almost all nations make the change in the middle if the night when airspace is very quiet and most airports have no departures at all there is virtually no knock-on effect.

"Why are the pitot tubes on supersonic combat aircraft so long?","8796","","<p>I've noticed that on combat aircraft the forward (nose-mounted) pitot tube is usually very long, on the order of half a meter to well over a meter on some aircraft. <strong>Why are they so long?</strong> Surely the body of the aircraft is not disturbing the air in front of the craft, neither during subsonic nor supersonic flight.</p>

","<p>The length is not needed for supersonic flight, but for subsonic flight at high angles of attack. Due to the high wing sweep, a high angle of attack capability just happens to coincide with supersonic configurations.</p>

<p>In subsonic flow the air ahead of the aircraft is influenced by the aircraft's pressure field, and at high angles of attack and high wing loadings this reaches out quite a bit. The pitot tube can only measure total pressure when it points into the flow direction. Ahead of the aircraft, the local flow angle increases the closer you are to the aircraft, and this increases measurement errors, because now the pitot tube sits at an oblique angle to the airflow. A longer pitot tube reaches farther out into still relatively undisturbed flow, so less compensation is needed to arrive at good values for total and static pressure. In early flight test, the pitot tube is much longer again, because the compensation factors are not yet established. </p>

","<p>The airjet openings are connected to a long duct running along the ceiling. Since the air volume inside the cabin is restricted, fresh air must be pumped into it constantly. It is bleed air from the compressor section of the engine, which is first cooled and then enters the cabin via those ducts which feed all the little vents or airjets, as you call them. Passengers can open or close them individually and direct the flow for best comfort. The general idea is that some vents will be closed, but enough are open during every flight so the needed recirculation of air can happen. If more are closed, the pressure in the duct will be higher, so the flow through the remaining vents will increase.</p>

"When can spoilers be used on airliners?","8661","","<p>On airliners, are spoilers used in any part of flight other than landing?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1TTVN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Spoilers have many uses, but first I want to distinguish types of spoilers.  Airplanes will typically have ground spoilers and flight spoilers and they work like they sound.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ground spoilers only open up on the ground -- these are usually much more detrimental to lift than the flight spoilers.</li>
<li>Flight spoilers open when actuated by the pilots</li>
</ul>

<p>Another type of spoiler is the spoileron, which is used on some airplanes like an aileron, that is to bank the airplane by destroying lift on one wing.</p>

<p>Since you ask about use in the air, I will focus on flight spoilers.  When would I use flight spoilers?</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to descend faster</li>
<li>I want to slow down quicker</li>
<li>I want to descend and slow down</li>
</ul>

<h3>I want to descend faster</h3>

<p>This can be broken down into three categories</p>

<ul>
<li>I screwed up and I need to make a crossing restriction</li>
<li>The anti/ice system turned on (more on this below)</li>
<li>I am initiating an emergency descent (abnormal)</li>
</ul>

<p>The bit about a/ice comes from the fact that on many airplanes when a/ice is on there is a high demand for bleed air.  In the EMB-145 the FADEC bumps up idle thrust quite a bit to meet this demand and if you did not anticipate this in your descent planning, we were authorized to use our spoilers in icing conditions to aid in the descent.  This could be interpreted as an ""I screwed up"" case, but really isn't in my opinion.</p>

<h3>I want to slow down faster</h3>

<p>If there is a charted speed restriction, this may be useful.  Particularly if you have just prioritized the descent to meet a crossing restriction and now need to bleed off speed.</p>

<p>You might need to start descending out of 10k feet ASAP, and need to be at 250 kts to do so, and in this case spoilers can be useful.</p>

<h3>I want to descend and slow down</h3>

<p>In a jet, this can be hard when clean.  Often the choice is descend <strong>or</strong> slow down.  When you need to do both, spoilers can be a great help.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the case of landing or rejected takeoff, all of the spoilers (including flight spoilers) should deploy automatically on most airplanes when the thrust levers are moved to idle, there is weight-on-wheels and you are above some threshold speed.</p>

<p>In addition, spoilers are useful in some airplanes for roll control, in addition to airplanes with pure spoileron roll control.  I didn't spend much time on this topic as like the ground spoilers in landing and RTO, these are passive from a pilot point of view -- you aren't specifically controlling these spoilers, the flight control system is doing it for you.  In any case, the spoilers used for roll control are quite important during flight.</p>

<p>As you can see, spoilers have many uses in flight and not just for landing.</p>

"How can I politely remind ATC that I'm waiting for instructions or clearance?","8647","","<p><em>(background: low-hour, low-experience, private pilot.)</em></p>

<p>I've got an issue regarding talking to air traffic controllers, especially when I think they may have messed up, yet still giving them the respect they deserve as hard working professionals.</p>

<p>One common scenario is when I'm ready to go, along with multiple other planes, all coming from various taxiways.   I know the tower tries hard to clear us each more-or-less in the order we've called up.   But when one plane feels they've been badly skipped, or possibly forgotten, it can get awkward.<p></p>

<p>I've heard a pilot say (very politely, and with good cause):<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""Tower; Arrow-23: Did you forget about me?""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>only to have the tower come back with a snappy and frustrated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""I'm doing the best I can.  I'll get you all out of here as fast as I can.  Just wait your turn!""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, that didn't go very well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've tried to be patient for awhile, only to learn that the Tower really did overlook me, and sequenced several planes out in front of me.</p>

<p>On the ground, its wasted fuel, HOBBS, and time.<br>
But in the air, it can be more significant.</p>

<p>Sometimes I've had tower miss actually clearing me to land.<br>If they're trying to sequence me in, I stay on an extended the downwind leg for a long time, waiting to be cleared before turning base.  But if they really did get busy and overlook me, I can end up well out of position.   </p>

<p>If I call and ask, sometimes they'll get a little testy with me if they are just busy.<br>
If I stay silent, I might've been skipped/forgotten, and end up flying downwind for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Whats the most appropriate, friendly, and polite way to check in and make sure nothing got missed, without sounding accusatory?</strong></p>
","<p>There's lots of advice I can give you here, but the answer is really that the degree of communication tower wants/needs depends on your local tower (and to some degree the individual controllers).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most universal piece of advice I can give you is to think like a controller.  Listen to the frequency and get a picture of what's going on in the airspace before you call them, and when you get good at it you'll also get good at knowing what kind of a situation you're flying in to (Is the airspace empty, or are there 4 planes in the pattern for landings, 3 in the opposite downwind shooting touch-and-gos, and a jet arrival on an instrument approach that just got dumped on the tower inside 7 miles barreling in &amp; messing everything up?) </p>

<p>Also remember that from a controller's perspective of priorities (""Safe, Orderly, Expedient"") speed doesn't count for much when compared to the other two requirements of the job (and aircraft on the ground are <em>inherently</em> Safe and Orderly unless they do something stupid like go charging across the hold-short line). Unfortunately for us pilots delaying the plane on the ground (that isn't moving, and is thus unlikely to hit anything) is generally preferable to trying to maneuver and delay the ones in the air (that can't stop moving unless they hit something, which is generally considered to be a Bad Thing).</p>

<p>For a masters class in ""thinking like a controller"" call your local tower and ask to arrange a tour / shadow a controller for an afternoon. Spending the day in the cab is a great way to get an appreciation for how crazy things can get up there.<br>
You can usually Google up the phone number, or call Flight Service or your local FSDO and ask. For most towers it's relatively easy to set up a tour (they'll ask for a driver's license and possibly FAA certificate number to do a background check and make sure you're not <em>completely</em> insane).</p>

<hr>

<p>The rest of this post is just my personal view on getting along with controllers based on doing most of my training &amp; flying at a pretty busy towered field (According to <a href=""http://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tower.asp"">the FAA's ATADS ""Tower Operations"" ranking</a> KFRG was #42 in 2013). </p>

<hr>

<h3>On The Ground</h3>

<p>When you're ready to go call tower and tell them - Something like <code>Tower, Cessna 12345 number one runway 32, ready to go.</code> is usually plenty (if your airport is configured such that there may be some question as to <em>where</em> you are specify which taxiway/intersection you're at).  </p>

<p>After you call the tower and tell them you're ready my experience is you're not likely to be forgotten about. You may be sitting there for a while (my personal record is about a half hour at the hold-short line), but the tower can <em>usually</em> see you sitting there at the runway end waiting. They want to get rid of you, they just need a hole big enough that they can get you onto the runway and airborne without creating any conflicts.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> forgotten (it does happen sometimes - you'll see other aircraft being cleared for takeoff who called the tower to report ready after you, or the controller changes, or you've been listening and are pretty sure the airspace is clear but you're still waiting) a polite call to remind the tower you're ready to go isn't out of order. Just don't be <em>That Guy</em> calling every couple of minutes, and if the controller gets a little snippy just be the better person and shrug it off.</p>

<hr>

<h3>In The Air</h3>

<p>In the air is a slightly different story.  Sometimes it can take me 3 or 4 calls to get tower to even acknowledge my existence on busy days (again, you don't want to be <em>That Guy</em> calling the tower every 10 seconds - you should have a picture of what's going on in the airspace, and if the controller is busy you may have to circle outside their airspace for a while).  </p>

<p>Once you've made contact a good controller will communicate with you and tell you what they need you to do and where they want you to report, where to turn base, or who they want you to follow.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've been forgotten a well-timed position report is usually the best way to remind the tower you exist (and as a bonus it helps everyone else with their mental picture of the airspace too).<br>
For example on an extended downwind for runway 01 at Republic you'll pass Sunrise Highway (a pretty easily identified road, and if you miss it you'll spot the train tracks right after it), the inner shore of Long Island, and the outer shore of the barrier beaches. Reporting each of those points while waiting for tower to call your base generally works (if they genuinely forgot about you they'll usually have an ""Oh S%$^!"" moment when you call them over the outer shoreline and turn you in for a 7-mile final).</p>

<hr>

<p>One exception to my position reports technique is landing clearance -- I generally do <em>something</em> to remind myself if I've been cleared to land (fold a chart, turn my kneeboard, etc.) and if I don't recall being cleared I'll call somewhere between 500 feet and the threshold with something line <code>Tower, confirm N12345 landing clearance?</code> (Where depends on the conditions of the day - sometimes they crank out departures pretty tight &amp; if someone's rolling waiting until they're airborne is usually a good idea).<br>
Sometimes they cleared me and I missed it.<br>
Sometimes they didn't clear me and they do.<br>
Sometimes they have an ""Oh S%$^!"" moment (they forgot about me, have a conflict, and I go around).</p>

<p>All of those situations are generally preferable to landing on a runway someone else may have been told they can use.</p>

<p>If a pilot doesn't have an Instrument Rating, and the weather conditions drop below VMC; what do they do?</p>

<p>Presumably you can't instantly land, but nor can you safely continue to fly without sufficient visibility?</p>

<p>I know the basic licence includes some instrument training, but is this enough to fly and land without visibility? I was under the impression that was the entire point of gaining an Instrument Rating... To train the pilot to fly on instruments alone</p>
","<p>It is very rare for weather to go IMC unexpectedly.</p>

<p>A responsible pilot should see that weather is deteriorating, and begin planning for the nearest available landing.   If they cannot find a landing, they should contact ATC while still in VMC, declare an emergency, and begin working with ATC to get down safely.</p>

<p>In some cases, a pilot may inadvertently enter IMC unexpectedly.   The standard procedure is to execute a standard rate 180&deg; turn, and fly equal time in the opposite direction.  That <em>should</em> get them back to VMC conditions. </p>

"What is the method to calculate a finite wing's lift from its sectional airfoil shape?","8617","","<p>I am struggling to get my head around a concept that I believe should be fairly simple to understand.</p>

<p>Lift versus drag and AoA data of many airfoils are freely available, for instance the NACA 4-digit airfoils.</p>

<p>The data is that of sectional, or 2D, lift and drag, or $C_l$ and $C_d$.</p>

<p>Now, if I were to build a 3D finite wing using a certain airfoil, how would I go about calculating the 3D coefficient of lift $C_L$?</p>

<p>I know that the aspect ratio $AR$ and Oswald efficiency factor $e$ come into play and that $C_D&lt;C_d$ because of 3D effects such as tip leakage.</p>

<p>As an example, let's look at the NACA2412 airfoil: At $\alpha=8$ and at $Re=5.7e6$, it experiences $C_l=1$.</p>

<p>If I now manufacture a wing of $AR=7$ which has a planform giving an efficiency $e=0.8$, how would I go about calculating $C_L$?</p>

<p>Are there any exact methods to calculate this or perhaps approximations?</p>
","<p>2D is a simplification of real life... it's very difficult to translate something 2D to something 3D. However there are approximations but I can tell you that no exact method is available.</p>

<p>One of the key components of drag that you are missing in 2D is the induced drag, which is the drag generated by a wing simply because it has a finite dimension. The difference in circulation created by each airfoil has an influence over the complete wing.</p>

<p>There is a theory which is linear and non-viscous that helps to compute the aerodynamic components of the wing, based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoils the wing is made of. It also allows you to create twist. It is subject to simplifications such as as being linear and missing viscosity, but it provides a very good approximation for the effort (analytical for a significant amount of cases, and excel does the work for others).</p>

<p>The theory is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting-line_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lifting-line theory</a> and what you just need to is: add the induced drag provided by the theory (you don't have it in your airfoil):</p>

<p>$\ C_{D_i} = \frac{{C_L}^2}{\pi \text{AR} e} $</p>

<p>You need to know the planform for being able to make the integral of your wing, but the following equation will save you some time:</p>

","<p>A quick check of a site like Flightradar24 will show that the area is not overly avoided. The triangle between the southern tip of Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico has quite a bit of traffic.</p>

<p>The southern part is a busy route from Florida to Puerto Rico and other areas in the Caribbean. The rest is also part of routes from the east coast to the Caribbean and South America.</p>

Anomalies in either magnetic bearings or radio aids such as VOR or GPS are routinely surveyed and listed on navigation charts. I took a quick look and nothing seemed to stand out here.

"Why do airliners pitch up during cruise?","8529","","<p>In my experience as a passenger, when the plane stands at the airport and you enter it, the aisle is pretty much horizontal. (Obviously, I've never flown on a DC-3). After takeoff we pitch sharply upwards (duh!), but even after the captain comes on the PA with ""we have now reached our cruise altitude"", the aisle continues to point a few degrees upward. Usually it's only at ""we're starting our descent into XYZ"" that the body returns to a more or less horizontal pitch.</p>

<p>Why is this? I have some hypotheses, but don't know which, if any, of them hold truth.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's just how the aerodynamics happen to work out. (Unlikely -- it would seem to be a simple engineering matter to attach the wings to the body at an angle such that the right angle of attack for cruise flight corresponded to the body being horizontal).</p></li>
<li><p>Pitching the body upwards slightly allows it to generate some lift, free of a proportional increase in drag relative to pushing the cylindrical body straight through the air.</p></li>
<li><p>Passenger jets are deliberately designed such that they never need to pitch lower than horizontal in a routine descent, lest passengers might panic and think they're nosediving to their death. (Also unlikely, unless there is <em>really</em> no hidden costs in terms of drag, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Landings might be more difficult if the plane had to point its nose downwards in order to get closer to the ground -- the nosewheel would hit the runway first. (On the other hand, simply leveling out would count as a flare, so it's not clear to me that's actually a disadvantage).</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Mainly the options 2 and 1 from your list.</p>

<p>What nobody mentioned so far, but is rather important here is that the angle of attack depends on <em>speed</em><sup>1</sup> and <em>weight</em>. While the ""speed"" does not vary much for most airliners, the difference between empty and fully loaded airliner is rather large.</p>

<p>Now if the fuselage was tilted down, it would generate lift directed down and associated drag with the net result of simply a lot of extra drag. So the aircraft is designed so that it does not fly (in level cruise) pitched down even when light. But that means that when it is fully loaded, it flies slightly pitched up, because it needs more lift and higher angle of attack to get it.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sub>&nbsp;It depends on the ""indicated speed"", which is not speed at all but rather dynamic pressure expressed as speed at which it would occur when moving through air of standard sea level pressure (1013.25 hPa). The pressure at high altitudes where airliners normally fly is significantly lower, so the indicated speed is usually does not exceed 250 knots when true speed is well over 400 knots.</sub></p>

<p>As you can see in the approach chart, the MDA is 660 feet for the localizer only approach. Assuming a glide path of 3°, I calculated a descent of 318 feet per Nautical Mile. However, that would not correlate to the 1919 feet at the Outer Marker.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to calculate / plan the approach in this example?</p>
","<p>The approach shows that the glideslope (if it were working) is a three degree descent angle.   You can calculate your own visual descent point (VDP), since one isn't provided for you, by taking the height above touchdown (600 ft. in this case) and dividing it by 300 ft/NM.  This gives you 2.0 miles from the runway.  Since the chart shows the runway threshold at 0.2 DME, your VDP will be at 2.2 DME.</p>

<p>Assuming that your navigation equipment does not provide a pseudo-glideslope, your best bet is to descend at your normal rate (in a light airplane I would say 800-900 fpm) until you level at 660 ft. (the MDA), then fly to your calculated VDP (2.2 DME) and if you have the required visual cues then descend to the runway knowing that it will be a standard 3 degree descent (300 ft./NM).  If you don't have it at this point, then you can start an early climb and fly the missed approach.</p>

<hr>

<p>Put another way, first you calculate your VDP:</p>

<p>$$\frac{Height~Above~Touchdown}{Descent~Rate}=VDP~Distance~From~Runway$$

"What medications may pilots take while flying?","8483","","<p>We all get sick, suffer from allergies and sometimes chronic issues.  It is not safe to fly while on some medicines or in some cases, for some time after taking the medicine.</p>

<p>How do I know what I can take and still fly?  What resources are out there to check if a specific medicine is compatible with flying (AOPA, FAA, etc)?  Is there a comprehensive list of what I can and cannot take?</p>
","<p>AOPA has the best database that I know of, but you have to be a member to view it.  They have some free information on their <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/Pilot-Resources/Medical/FAA-Policy.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Medications</a> page though. </p>

<p>There they talk about FAA Policy, and it starts with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Federal Aviation Regulations include no specific references to
  medication usage. FAR 61.53 prohibits acting as pilot-in-command or in
  any other capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember, while that
  person:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Knows or has reason to know of any medical condition that would make the person unable to meet the requirement for the medical certificate
  necessary for the pilot operation, or:</p></li>
  <li><p>Is taking medication or receiving other treatment for a medical condition that results in the person being unable to meet the
  requirements for the medical certificate necessary for the pilot
  operation. Further, FAR 91.17 prohibits the use of ""any drug that
  affects the persons faculties in any way contrary to safety.""</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.aviationmedicine.com/medication-database/"" rel=""nofollow"">AMAS</a> (Aviation Medicine Advisory Service) also has a list (which is free) but I don't think that it is organized as well.  They are recommended by ALPA and NBAA though.</p>

<p>The most important thing though, of course, is to self evaluate and make sure that you don't fly if you are having any adverse reactions from the medication, <em>or the underlying condition</em> that you are taking the medicine for.</p>

<p>Any list that you consult has to be used only as a guide though, and not a carte-blanche approval.  Individual people can have reactions even to medications that are considered ""safe"" and ""allowed"" by the FAA, and this is why they don't list specific medications that they allow.  The FAA has a brochure called <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/pilots/safety/pilotsafetybrochures/media/Meds_brochure.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Medications and Flying</a>, and one part of it has a few things to consider before taking any medication:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, consider the underlying condition  that you are treating. What
  will be the  consequences if the medication doesn’t work  or if it
  wears off before the ﬂight is over?  A good general rule to follow is
  not to ﬂy  if you must depend on the medication to  keep the ﬂight
  safe. In other words, if the  untreated condition is one that would
  prevent  safe ﬂying, then you shouldn’t ﬂy until the  condition
  improves — whether you take the  medication or not.</p>
  
  <p>Second, you must <strong>consider your reaction to  the medication</strong>. There
  are two broad categories  of medication reactions. One is a unique
  reaction  based on an individual’s biological make-up.  Most people
  don’t have such reactions but  anyone can, given the right medication.
  Because  of this, you should NEVER ﬂy after taking any  medication
  that you have not taken before. It  is not until after you have taken
  the medication  that you will ﬁnd out whether you have this  uncommon
  and unexpected reaction to the  medication.</p>
  
  <p>Third, <strong>consider the potential for adverse  reactions,</strong> or side
  effects — unwanted reactions  to medications. This type of reaction is
  quite common, and the manufacturer of the  medication lists these on
  the label. You MUST  carefully read all labeling. If you don’t have 
  access to the label, then don’t ﬂy while using the  medication. </p>
  
  <p>Look for such key words as lightheadedness,  dizziness, drowsiness, or
  visual disturbance. If  these side effects are listed or if the label
  contains  any warning about operating motor vehicles or  machinery,
  then you should not ﬂy while using  the medication. </p>
  
  <p>Side effects can occur at any time, so even if  you’ve taken the same
  medication in the past  without experiencing side effects, they could
  still  occur the next time. For this reason, you must  never ﬂy after
  taking a medication with any of  the above-noted side effects.</p>

Second, for the sake of a specific example, what would be required for someone who holds a private pilot certificate in the U.S. to fly an aircraft registered in the Philippines within the Philippines (assuming that the aircraft type is one for which the pilot is rated in the U.S.?) </p>
","<p>For your specific example, <a href=""http://www.caap.gov.ph/index.php/downloads/viewcategory/8-civil-aviation-regulation-car"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Philippines Civil Aviation Regulations Part 2</a> (Personnel Licensing), section 2.2.4 covers ""Validation and Conversion of Foreign Licenses and Ratings."" It states that a holder of a license from a ""Contracting State in accordance with ICAO Annex 1"" (this includes the United States) is eligible for ""validation"" of their foreign license. The validation process involves presenting the appropriate documentation of your license, ratings and logbook. For more than just PPL privileges, you must also pass a ""skill test"" and demonstrate the required knowledge and ability. The conversion (""validation certificate"") gives you the same ratings you had on your US license and is valid for 1 year.</p>

<p>The FAA has a very similar policy for foreign-to-US license conversion, covered in <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title14-vol2-sec61-75.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">14 CFR §61.75</a>. As in the Philippines, the FAA does not require a skills test for private pilot privileges, but a written knowledge test is required for conversion of an instrument rating.</p>

<p>Most other ICAO states recognize each other's licenses in a similar manner.

I haven't look up the exact regulations for, say, EASA (Europe) or CAAC (China) but I'm sure they aren't far off from the examples above. In reality diplomatic considerations probably also come into play: a holder of an Iranian license would probably run into problems attempting to convert/validate their license in Israel, even though both are ICAO-contracting states, since they aren't on very good political terms to say the least. But this will likely be the exception rather than the rule.</p>

<p>When a company buys an aircraft, do they also own the engines, or are they still the property of the engine manufacturer? What happens when an engine must be exchanged?</p>
","<p>These days, engine manufacturers are not any more in the business of selling engines, but <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/12887368"" rel=""noreferrer"">selling thrust</a>.</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce were the first to offer this, and today most Rolls-Royce engines send telemetry data to four centers, the biggest one in Derby, in Great Britain, where every engine is under surveillance. An inspection can be scheduled at or spare parts can be directed to the right destination even before the pilots or the airline know that one of their engines has a problem.</p>

<p>By now, 80% of Rolls-Royce engines are sold at a loss which is recouped by a hourly fee paid under the <a href=""http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/dinamic-content/media/Executive%20Briefing%206%20-%20RR%20Totalcare%20-%20Mtg%20the%20Needs%20of%20Key%20Customers%20%20-%208%20Mar%2010%20v9.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">TotalCare (.pdf!)</a> program, and that center in Derby is monitoring maybe 4000 of them at the same time. Rolls-Royce has accumulated a treasure of engine operations data, which enables it to consult airlines on best practices. This makes it very hard for a third party to steal maintenance business from Rolls-Royce. All maintenance cost is covered by the TotalCare fee which now accounts for more than half of Rolls-Royce's revenue.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.geaviation.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">GE</a> and <a href=""http://www.pw.utc.com/Home"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pratt&amp;Whitney</a> have <a href=""http://www.pwc.ca/en/service-support/general-aviation-pay-by-the-hour"" rel=""noreferrer"">similar programs</a>.

The airline does not pay for the engines, but for the time they are flying. Now the engine manufacturer has a strong incentive to improve the reliability of its engines, but also a strong lever to push out third-party maintenance providers.</p>

"Why do gases in the combustion chamber only flow one direction to the gas turbine in a jet engine?","8453","","<p>As far as I know from the working principle of jets engines, compressed air in the combustion chamber (or combustion canister) is mixed with fuel. The ignited mixture expands backwards to turn the turbine rotors and perpetuates the work cycle. Eventually, the left over hot gas creates the thrust.</p>

<p>Although heated gas expands in every direction in space, why does the combustion-gas only expand in one direction, towards the turbine? </p>
","<p>It is actually not that simple to ensure the proper gas speed in a gas turbine. In the compressor you want to limit the flow speed over the compressor vanes to the high subsonic range, so the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9066/why-cant-jet-engines-operate-with-supersonic-air-and-how-do-they-slow-it-down/9222#9222"">inlet has to decelerate the flow</a> down to approx. Mach 0.4 - 0.5. Less would mean less throughput and consequently less thrust.</p>

<p>This speed, however, is far too high for ignition. The <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/10002/why-is-the-combustor-volume-of-a-jet-engine-decided-by-altitude/10014#10014"">fuel needs some time to mix with the compressed air</a>, and if flow speed is high, your combustion chamber becomes very long and the engine becomes heavier than necessary. Therefore, the cross section leading from the compressor to the combustion chamber is carefully widened to slow down the airflow without separation (see the section below named ""diffusor""). Around the fuel injectors you will find the lowest gas speed in the whole engine. Now the combustion heats the gas up, and makes it expand. The highest pressure in the whole engine is right at the last compressor stage - from there on pressure only drops the farther you progress. This ensures that no backflow into the compressor is possible. However, when the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressor_stall"" rel=""noreferrer"">compressor stall</a>s (this is quite like a wing stalling - the compressor vanes are little wings and have the same limitations), it cannot maintain the high pressure and you get reverse flow. This is called a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7799/why-do-jet-engines-sometimes-spit-out-flames-after-ingesting-birds"">surge</a>.</p>

<p>The graph below shows typical values of flow speed, temperature and pressure in a jet engine. Getting these right is the task of the engine designer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLcXa.jpg"" alt=""Plot of engine flow parameters over the length of a turbojet""></p>

<p>Plot of engine flow parameters over the length of a turbojet (picture taken from <a href=""http://cast-safety.org/pdf/3_engine_fundamentals.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> publication)</p>

<p>The rear part of the engine must block the flow of the expanding gas less than the forward part to make sure it continues to flow in the right direction. By keeping the cross section of the combustor constant, the engine designer ensures that the expanding gas will accelerate, converting thermal energy to kinetic energy, without losing its pressure (the small pressure drop in the combustor is caused by friction). Now the accelerated flow hits the turbine, and the pressure of the gas drops in each of its stages, which again makes sure that no backflow occurs. The turbine has to take as much energy from the flow as needed to run the compressor and the attached pumps and generators without blocking the flow too much.</p>

<p>The remaining pressure is again converted to speed <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9653/adjustable-area-jet-engine-nozzles"">in the nozzle</a>. Now the gas is still much hotter than ambient air, and even though the flow at the end of the nozzle is still subsonic in modern airliner engines, the actual flow speed is much higher than the flight speed. The speed difference between flight speed and the exit speed of the gas in the nozzle is what produces <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9144/how-is-engine-thrust-measured-in-flight"">thrust</a>.</p>

<p>Fighter engines usually have supersonic flow at the end of the nozzle, which requires careful shaping and adjustment of the nozzle contour. Read all about it <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9653/adjustable-area-jet-engine-nozzles"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another picture of this strange occurrence. This generally happens with thrust reversal.</p>
","<p>Whenever there is under-pressure in air, the air flows along the gradient of this under-pressure, i.e. into the direction of the source of the under-pressure. (In first order.)</p>

<p>If there's a wall (or the ground) in the way, air will flow along the surface of this obstacle and will change its direction at some point, as shown in this sketch:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ui1pe.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ui1pe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, imagine the whole air around the engine is rotating slowly for some reason around the symmetry axis in the sketch.  </p>

<p>From physics, you may know the conservation of momentum, or in this case, of angular momentum. It says that the product of distance to rotation axis times RPM of this rotation is constant for a certain particle. If a particle reduces its distance to the axis, its RPM increases.<br>
This is like the spinning ice skater, who rotates faster when he pulls his arms to his body (to the axis).</p>

<p>This law also applies to packets of air, which are sucked to the axis, though internal friction brakes the air to some extent.</p>

<p>The fast rotating air near the axis encounters a centrifugal force, i.e. the air is pulled away from the axis, forming a region of strong under-pressure. In this region, the air expands and so, cools down. This can cause condensation of water, if the humidity of the air is high enough. And that's what you can see on your pictures.</p>

<p>There's still one question unanswered: I wrote, this happens if the surrounding air is rotating slowly. This usually happens, because the wind is deflected from the aircraft itself, which means it changes its direction, which is some kind of rotation.</p>

<p>And of course, a strong, non-uniform air flow from the rear, as generated by the reverse thrusters, can cause more / stronger rotating air, which results into stronger vertices. So, it's no wonder when they appear (or better: become more visible) in this case.</p>

<p>Here is a nice picture of a simulation, which also shows that the fuselage can be the wall where the vortex is created.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JqwYJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JqwYJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<em>Source: <a href=""http://gallery.ensight.com/keyword/aerospace/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://gallery.ensight.com</a></em></p>

<p>It seems the wind comes from the camera position, or a bit more right of it. It gets deflected by the fuselage and flows along it, which explains the straight lines coming from the rear and the curved ones coming from the front left of the aircraft. If you imagine the air flow along / under the fuselage, you may also understand why the two vertices are rotating in different orientations.</p>

<p>As the strong under-pressure inside the vortex, it may also suck in dust or even larger objects, which can damage the engine. For aircraft landing on unpaved airfields, <em>unpaved strip kits</em> may be available, which can contain a vortex dissipator:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oycDA.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oycDA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<em>Source: <a href=""http://www.b737.org.uk/unpavedstripkit.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.b737.org.uk</a></em></p>

<p>This is a nozzle blowing bleed air into the region where vortices could apper, reducing the under-pressure and so the risk of ingesting objects from the ground.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>You can see something similar in the sink of your bathtub. As soon as there is a little rotation, it is amplified above the sink, the centrifugal force pushes the water aside, and forms this fast rotating vortex.</p>

<p>A tornado is a giant version of an inlet vortex. The air is moving along ground over far distances, until it moves upwards at some point, and a slight rotation leads to this fast rotating hose sticking to the ground and sucking in everything due to the strong under-pressure inside.</p>

<p>And a bit off-topic:</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can see vortices at the wing tips or at the edges of engaged flaps of aircraft flying through humid air. The reason is similar: The air is put into rotation due to the higher pressure below and the lower above the wings. (But that's not exactly the same as inlet vortices.) And sometimes, you also see fog forming above the wing just because of the under-pressure.<br>
On this picture, you see both, and may imagine the rotation for the second vortex from the right.</p>

"How does an Airbus aircraft connect to the Internet?","8399","","<p>I would like to understand better where (physically in the aircraft) and how the Internet connection is received on an Airbus aircraft, in particular in an Airbus A380, and then how this system is linked to the access points that serve the passengers. What path(s) bring(s) the connection from the antenna to the access points that make it available to the passengers?</p>
","<p>There are three different ways that aircraft can give internet access to its passengers, which will most likely be on at around 38,000 feet. First off, to have Inflight wifi, there needs to be a ground-based internet server, a transmitting dish, or a satellite dish. There must also be a receiving and transmitting antenna on the aircraft and an onboard server and a Wi-Fi router.</p>

<p>The first system is the ATG system, which stands for Air-To-Ground transmission. It requires two antennas that are installed on the belly of an aircraft so that it can pick up signals from the ground-based cell towers. With this system, a passenger can receive at least 3 Mbps and one of the highest currently is 9.8 Mbps by gogo wifi.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e2CxP.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e2CxP.jpg"" alt=""ATG Antenna on the belly of an aircraft.""></a></p>

<p>The next system is the ""Ku-Band"" Service, which was formerly used by the military. K, short for Kurz (meaning short in German) and u for under the original NATO/K-band frequency range. This system works by a ground station sending signals to a satellite first, and then reflect off the satellite and send the signals to the aircraft. The signal is then decoded and then transferred to the router. This can deliver about 50 Mbps with this system, but you still have to consider that there will be more than a hundred passengers on the aircraft. Since this system has to send signals to a satellite first, there could also be delays on signals and could get slower as more aircrafts use this service. If you've seen aircraft with a pod on the top of its fuselage, you may not know that under it sits a satellite antenna, which rotates and can adjust itself to the nearest satellite.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuWwk.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuWwk.png"" alt=""Ku-Band satellite pod""></a></p>

<p>The last system is the ""Ka-Band"" Service. K still stands for Kurz, and a stands for above since this is in the upper region of the native frequency band which is at 20&ndash;36&nbsp;GHz. This service can deliver about 70&nbsp;Mbps. Presently, there are two ViaSat (a satellite wireless service provider) Ka-Band satellites, one covering the US, and one covering Canada and parts of Europe.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CekOF.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CekOF.jpg"" alt=""Open Ka-Band satellite""></a></p>

<p>Some aircraft even have a hybrid system, so they can use Ku-Band and Ka-Band service depending on which has a better signal at the time, so it would depend on the internet speed on which the A380 you are referring to is.</p>

<p>An onboard server will be required on the aircraft for an Inflight Entertainment system, which will run three services: a media server, a DRM (Digital Rights Management) license server, and a device provisioning server. The media server is for storing your content keys (but doesn't necessarily have to be on the media server, it can be on a separate onboard server). The device provisioning server will need to store a reserve of device personalities (unique device credentials) for distribution to onboard mobile devices (via your mobile app) upon request. The signals from the satellite (in a Ku/Ka-Band service) will be transmitted into the pod/antenna, then into the onboard server, which will be transmitted to several routers distributed throughout the aircraft. For example, an A320 or a B737 usually have two routers. The signal is sent to your phone, then signals will be sent back to the antenna, then to the satellite, which is passed back to the ground.</p>

"How do seaplanes do run-up checks without brakes?","8392","","<p>Usually on run-up you want to check the response of the motor when changing for example the carb-heat (if existent). At least we did so on my intro flight (yey!). To prevent us from rolling onto the active runway we (obviously) held the brakes. </p>

<p>Now I wondered how pilots of floating planes and flying boats prevent movement on pre-takeoff checks. Additionally most images I found from flying boats they usually have more than one engine. Similar question here: How do pilots prevent swimming circles as one engine is started and the other(s) is/are not?</p>

<p>I scanned <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/seaplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-23-4.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this FAA document</a> from <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/30314/how-do-aircraft-brake-when-using-skis"">this related question</a> but that is mostly is about landing (which is interesting as well but I assume that as in the linked question the airframe and especially the water resistance take care of that).</p>
","<p>I'll limit my answer to single-engine seaplanes as I've never flown a multi-engine seaplane.</p>

<p>Typically there is no need to stay stationary in the water when doing a run-up. Just do it while taxiing to your takeoff path, or you can do it on your takeoff path. If the takeoff path isn't long enough to do the run-up and then continue along the path for the takeoff, you can turn around, taxi back along the takeoff path, and then takeoff.</p>

<p>At typical run-up power settings, if you hold full up elevator, the airplane will simply mush along on the water since you won't have anywhere near enough power to get it up on the step. In other words, you won't be going very fast.</p>

<p>When giving floatplane instruction, one of the first things I tried to impress on students was to not think in terms of the constraints of straight, hard-surface, defined runways, taxiways and the like. There's no need, typically, to taxi in a straight line, make well-defined taxiing turns, and no need to takeoff in a straight line. Once away from the dock or beach, the airplane is going to weather vane unless you actively oppose that, and that weathervaning is going to have a component caused by the current, if any, of the water you're on.</p>

<p>In my experience, most of the time the takeoff path was either dictated directionally (a river) or pretty much wide open (lake or reservoir). For new students in my area, reservoirs were preferred. More often than not, it was a matter of getting a short ways off the dock, do the checks other than the run-up while moving away from the shore at a 90 degree angle more or less, lift the water rudder, bring the stick all the way back, and do the run-up, all the while letting the aircraft weathervane into the wind. Then just takeoff.</p>

<p>I never flew a twin-engined seaplane, but I see no reason why you couldn't bring both engines up to the run-up rpm, do the checks on one and then the other. While checking the mags, carb heat, and props, there would be a little asymmetrical thrust, but not enough that the rudder couldn't handle that.</p>

"Can airliners operate without an operating APU?","8387","","<p>As the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) can be turned off when the engines are running, a functional APU may not be needed given you are able to start at least one engine. This question is in two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it technically feasible to operate an airliner without APU (with the necessary ground support)?</li>
<li>If so, in what conditions is it legal (number of passengers transported, <a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Minimum_Equipment_List_%28MEL%29"" rel=""nofollow"">MEL</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test"" rel=""nofollow"">test flight</a>,...)?</li>
</ul>

<p>This question focuses on airliners. If needed, it can be narrowed to best-sellers (B737 and A320).</p>
","<p>Yes, you can operate without an APU.  If the APU is inoperative you will need to write it up and coordinate with maintenance and dispatch to operate under the stipulations of the MEL.  This may restrict certain kind of operations but if we assume a route completely over land this has no effect other than needed ground services.</p>

<p>The requirements for no-APU is simply a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxLPl7v7zgE"">ground start ""huffer""</a> cart at your departure airport.  Ideally you want one at the destination as well but if not available you can possibly coordinate leaving an engine running during the turn.  More generally though, if the destination does not have access to a huffer cart you will get an aircraft swap and the non-APU aircraft will be assigned to a route that does have those ground services available.</p>

<p>The general process of a non-APU flight is keeping ground power and ground air conditioning hooked up to the airplane for pre-flight activity and boarding.  Once the airplane is closed up the ground crew will coordinate with you to provide air via the ground start cart and you'll start one or both of your engines.  After you have an engine running, you'll disconnect all of the ground equipment and push back.  During the taxi, if you only started one engine earlier you'll perform a crossbleed start to start the other engine.  The takeoff engine bleed and pack configuration may be different for a non-APU takeoff but once you are airborne and set the bleeds and packs for post-takeoff you will be operating exactly the same way you would normally operate and the differences cease.</p>

<p>On arrival the only differences are to make sure you keep an engine running at the gate until ground power is hooked up.  </p>

<p>The biggest downside to operating without an APU is the lack of decent air conditioning during taxi and ground operations.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Other considerations for operating without an APU are airplane specific.  For example, the EMB-145 has two generators per engine and one on the APU for a total of five generators.  The airplane will revert to ""essential"" power if less than 3 generators are available which means you will lose certain displays and systems that become unpowered.  This means if you had an engine failure during flight without an APU you will be in essential power and have to land in that condition because you cannot start the APU to get back up to 3 generators operating. </p>

I see at least three players all trying to enter this market which seems perpetually stuck as coming about in the next 4-5 years and all seem to have benefited from the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) project that was <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/lemv-airship-canceled/26274/"" rel=""noreferrer"">canceled in January 2013</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.hybridairvehicles.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hybrid Air Vehicles</a> in the U.K. has partnered with Northrop Grumman owns a prototype that came out of the LEMV project and plans to build a 50-ton capacity airship in about five years.</li>

</ul>

<p>It appears none of these companies has any current orders and are all <a href=""http://www.ocregister.com/articles/aeroscraft-611707-air-blimp.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">looking for funding</a> to build their proposed cargo airships.  Apparently an investment of on the order of 50 to 250 million USD would allow one of these to be built for commercial use.  While this is a lot of money, it is small compared to other aviation investments. For example, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boeing 787 Dreamliner</a> required 32 billion USD as of 2011.</p>

<p>Today, all such airships use noble gas helium instead of the very flammable hydrogen used in the Hindenburg accident, so the historical fear of using such ships should not apply to the new technologies.  These proposed ships are planned to travel at between 70 and 115 MPH, so while not as fast as airplanes, they do compete with trucking and shipping speeds.</p>

<p>So the question is, given the relatively small cost to develop one of these cargo lift systems, why hasn't a company like Boeing with deep pockets wanted to invest in such systems and these companies continue to search for funding?  Is there some kind of flaw in the proposal that such a new cargo shipping approach would save money?  Is it that the market is too small to interest big companies? The hangar space required to store and maintain these ships is huge and little such infrastructure currently exists, perhaps that is their downfall?  Alternatively, maybe their maintenance requirements are their Achilles heel?</p>
","<p>First of all, there is the question of demand. There aren't enough cases where a very heavy load needs to be moved to a remote location by air. There are probably even fewer where there are funds to actually pay for this option. The An-225 is currently the largest aircraft in operation, and it was only constructed under special circumstances. Although has certainly found use, they still haven't even found the funds to finish a second one which is partially built.</p>

<p>When this option is needed today, helicopters are deployed on cargo aircraft to the area. The helicopters may have to make multiple trips but can do the job. So the subset of cases is even smaller; where heavy cargo needs to be delivered to a remote area and also cannot be split into shipments that helicopters can handle. Deploying a large airship in this manner is also much harder. Either the airship would have to fly itself there, which could take a long time, or it would have to be reduced to a transportable size.</p>

<p>The airship would also need to be protected from the weather somehow. This could require either a very large (and expensive) hangar. Without a hangar, the airship must be tethered, and restraining such a large surface area in the wind would be difficult.</p>

<p>Wind would also affect operation of the airship. Helicopters are of course limited by weather conditions, but wind would have a much greater effect on a large and slow airship.</p>

<p>If the airship could be fairly easily collapsible, it would solve the issues of storage and transportation. However, this is not a simple problem to solve. This would require a large development budget. If you are comparing this to the cost of the 787 development, where are you going to find buyers for 1000 of these airships in order to break even and make them affordable?</p>

<p>The issue is that there needs to be a market for this kind of transportation, which currently competes at least partially with existing helicopters. Why invest in a new type of vehicle when the current option works fine for most cases?</p>

Does the A380 have the same capability? If not, how would an airline manage an aircraft needing a new engine whilst away from a maintenance base?</p>
","<p>One of the main reasons the 747 was given the ability to ferry an engine was due to the lack of large cargo aircraft available at the time.</p>

<p>Don't forget the 747 was a major game changer when it came out, it was designed to replace the 707/DC-8, and was almost twice the size of these aircraft. As a result, there just wasn't anything available to transport a 747 engine by air if needed.</p>

<p>This was a major problem that had the potential to affect sales of the aircraft, and so they had to find a solution to this. It wasn't until the 747 began to be introduced as a cargo carrier that it was possible to transport these engines by air, in the hold of an aircraft.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the A380, there was no need to add engine ferry capabilities, as large cargo aircraft were common enough to transport them.</p>

"Do helicopter rotor tips regularly go supersonic?","8341","","<p>In my question about helicopter noise, I made the assumption that one reason they are so darn noisy is that the main rotor tips go faster than the speed of sound. @FreeMan questioned whether that was the case.</p>

<p>I've tried to find information about this but most pages end up discussing V<sub>NE</sub> -- the forward speed at which the advancing blades go supersonic while the retreating blades lose lift and stall. This is not about that situation.</p>

<p>This is about regular flight -- is the extremely loud noise from helicopters because their rotor tips are supersonic, or is from other sources?</p>

<p><sub>p.s. There is some mention that the ""WOP-WOP"" of descending helicopters is caused by the rotor tips going supersonic. Is this the case - and if so, is it an edge case (the only time the tips are supersonic) or just one example of when they do. </sub></p>
","<p>The ""wop wop"", usually known as blade slap, is heard when the tip of the blade passes through the vortex created by the previous one.</p>

<p>It can be avoided.  The most common flight regime when this happens is a shallow descent but still with quite a lot of power - e.g. fast and shallow.  The vortex starts to move down as soon as it leaves the tip of the blade so in level flight, the following blade passes over it.  In a shallow descent with high pitch angle, the following blade can literally ""slap"" into the previous vortex.  The vortices of the two blades now interact and can cause local, transient supersonic flow.  To avoid it, simply lower the pitch to establish a more positive descent or pull back on the cyclic to increase disc loading and flatten the attitude.</p>

<p>The blade tips do not go supersonic.  In fact, in nearly all helicopter designs, the rotor rotates within a very narrow range of speeds, typically between 90% and 110% of the normal speed.  In most flight regimes, the rotor is rotating at 100%, +/- a few percent, whether you are climbing, descending or cruising.  Only during auto-rotation and aggressive manoeuvring does the range vary by 10% or more.  It depends on the type of helicopter but absolute limits would be something like 85% (panic time, risk of complete stall) and 115% (smaller panic, risk of damage to the machine, especially in the tail rotor drive shaft).</p>

<p><strong>In normal operations, and design aims to achieve this, the rotor tips do not go supersonic</strong> since when they do, there is a sudden and large decrease in performance with more power required, higher blade loads, vibration and noise.  </p>

<p>Think about a helicopter flying forwards.  The advancing blade at its most perpendicular position experiences a relative airflow which is equal (ignoring all kinds of minor side effects) to the forward speed plus the speed of the blade.  The retreating blade is experiencing a relative airflow equal to the speed of the blade minus the speed of the helicopter.  </p>

<p>If the blades rotate so fast that the tips are supersonic, then the main lift generating part of the retreating blade, the outer two thirds of the span, would experience such a low airspeed, for some of the span it will even be negative, that the blades will stall causing a catastrophic roll into that side.  It is this phenomenon which ultimately limits the rotational speed of the blades and the maximum speed of the helicopter.</p>

<p>Let's look at the R22 as an example.  The following figures are approximate.</p>

<p>The rotor tip speed is about 670 fps (feet per second).  The speed of sound at ground level on a standard day is about 1100 fps.  The R22 is flying at close to VNE, let's say 100kts which is about 170 fps.</p>

<p>The tip on the advancing side, at it's fastest, is therefore flying relative to the airflow at 840 fps and on the retreating side, at it's slowest, at 500 fps.  </p>

<p>The blade length is about 11 feet, so the middle portion of the blade on the retreating side is only flying at 190 fps (half of 670 minus the airspeed).  When you get to about 4 feet out from the blade root, it's now only 50 fps and not much further in from that, becomes zero, then negative.</p>

<p>Remember that lift is proportional to the square of the speed.  You can now see the huge discrepancy between lift on either side as airspeed increases.</p>

<p>To answer your question directly, the R22 would need to fly at 530 fps to approach supersonic tip speed which equates to about 330 kts which it can't get anywhere near achieving.</p>

<p>PS.  The R22 POH speaks in Imperial measures.  When I get some time, I'll redo the figures in metric which I, and most of the world, prefer.</p>

"Why is Hydrazine used to power the F-16's EPU?","8326","","<p>Why does the military use hydrazine to power the F-16's Emergency Power Unit (EPU)? What is so unique about Hydrazine fuel that it's  needed to power the EPU? Why not use a less volatile and less hazardous fuel?  </p>
","<p>The EPU of F-16 is fueled with a monopropellant hydrazine mixture, H-70, which contains 70% hydrazine ($N_{2}H_{4}$) and 30% water, by weight. </p>

<p>The main requirements for the EPU are that it should be simple, maintenance free, supply power immediately and consistently for the required time. Use of Hydrazine assures this while requiring careful handling.</p>

<p>Basically, the catalytic decomposition of hydrazine produces ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen. Exhuast Gases from EPU Turbine contain 40% Ammonia, 17% Nitrogen, 15% Hydrogen and 28% Water. </p>

<p>$3N_{2}H_{4} \rightarrow 4NH_{3} + N_{2}$</p>

<p>$4NH_{3} \rightarrow 2N_{2} + 6H_{2}$</p>

<p>$3N_{2}H_{4} \rightarrow 4(1-x)NH_{3} + 6xH_{2} + (2x+1) N_{2}$</p>

<p>where x is the fraction of the $NH_{3}$ disassociated.</p>

<p>The water modifies the decomposition temperature (the EPU reaches temperatures of ~870 $^{\circ}C$), preventing thermal damage to the catalyst bed and the turbine parts. As the water removes heat, it is turned into steam which aids in powering the EPU.</p>

<p>The EPU, using hydrazine spins up to approximately 75,000 rpm in 2-3 seconds (The F-16 EPU starts within 2 sec.). It would take a much greater time if another fuel, like JP-8 were used. When required (EPU runs normally on engine bleed air), hydrazine is <a href=""http://www.f-16.net/forum/download/file.php?id=3433&amp;sid=b6af33b232f0538d3c91d8a88a132edb"" rel=""nofollow"">forced into decomposition chamber by nitrogen pressure</a>, where the above reactions produce the gases to run the turbine/gearbox. The decomposition of hydrazine produces enough pressure, eliminating the need for a compressor, thus saving weight and also eliminating the need for an igniter, reducing complexity.</p>

<p>For the given weight, it provides continuous operation for the required time. In F-16, the EPU carries ~25l of hydrazine, which permits operation for about 10 minutes under normal load conditions and 15 minutes if the loads are less (i.e. in ground). If any other form, (like battery or cartridge) were used, it would be difficult to have a long operational time without heavy increase in mass. </p>

<p>For a combat aircraft, RAT is not an option. Also, a hydrazine powered EPU would work in any altitude or during maneuvering as it does not need an external oxidizer supply.</p>

"On how many routes an aircraft is used on a typical day?","8319","","<p>I wonder how an commercial aircraft used to transport passengers is used on a typical day. I imagine several scenarii, but I cannot figure out if they are right:</p>

<ul>
<li>take off in the morning from the company's hub to an airport and then get back and begin again all day long, possibly with a changing the crew when turning at the company's hub</li>
<li>from the company's hub, begin the day with a round trip to an airport A, then performing a round trip to from the hub to an airport B, and continuing with other airport until the end of the day</li>
<li>a triangular shape: a one-way leg from the hub to an airport A, then another leg from the airport A to an airport B, and then another from B to the hub, and continuing until the end of the day. A derivative could be the same with more airports (hub --> A --> B --> C --> D --> hub)</li>
<li>a long multi-leg route in one direction and then back (eg. A --> B --> C --> D --> C --> B --> A)</li>
</ul>
","<p>Actually, a commercial airliner <em>can</em> do almost <strong>any</strong> set of legs, assuming those are technically possible (range/payload/laws like ETOPS...) But the main fact that make it possible is <strong>demand</strong>. If you run an airline, you won't make routes that don't have demand to make profit.</p>

<p>Aviation is a complex world. To make profit, you have to consider a massive load of parameters. You can't for example position complete set of crew in every city/airport hotel of your airline routes then decide to create fantasy flights ""a la carte"". Crews can't fly continuously aswell, so you can't put crew in a 737 and make them non-stop flights around the country an entire week.</p>

<p>One main thing you have to keep in mind : It's not one or several persons who decide <em>""I want to build an airline with X aircraft on Y routes""</em>. It's one A-B route that decide how many passengers are available on, then, an airline has the opportunity to operate that route (and struggle to negociate all the authorizations)</p>

<p>Here are some hints about how airliners deals with their environment around the world :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What kind of flights does the airliner, and what airframes does it have in its fleet ?</p>

<ul>
<li>An airliner can start with one single aircraft, says a DHC6 Twin Otter, and makes regular flights between two airports in the middle of the ocean. You can have 10, 15, maybe 20 round trip a day, some well after sunset.</li>
<li>An airliner can have half a dozen ATR or Dash 8, and a set of routes with the proper demand. You can have routes like hub-A-hub, hub-B-hub, when the demand is enough to make each flight profitable. Sometimes, you can't have enough passenger a day on each route, so the airliner makes hub-A-B-C-D-hub the day one, then hub-D-C-B-A-hub on day two, and cycle the sets...</li>
<li>An airliner with dozens of (the same) aircraft (737 or A32x) can either have the same round trip hub-X-hub destinations every day, several times a day, airlines like Air France, Southwest, Lufthansa, Air China... or the same fleet, but much more destinations operated two or three times a week : hub-A-B-hub, hub-C-D-E-hub, hub-F-G-H-nightstop-G-F-hub... like Angola Airlines (domestic and regional)</li>
<li>Long range flights (7 hours or more) requires the appropriate aircraft. If your airline can buy/lease such an airliner, the route hub-destination-hub can be operated in the limits of the demand. When the demand is enough to fill the plane along the week, then go ahead. Otherwise, the airline has to decide wether a) leave the plane on the tarmac, b) find a nearby complementary route : hub-A-B-hub, hub-B-A-hub, c) use a smaller and cheaper aircraft (if the crew is qualified on) d) combine destination A with a complementary destination B that fills schedules along the week (or bi-week) hub-A-hub-B-hub, e) replace the route with one better, f) negociate with one or several airliners to sell seats to them to fill the aircraft, g) negociate with one or several airliners operating on the destination airport to take advantage of the hubbing : make your airline land at the destination during rush hours.</li>
<li>Very long range flights can't be operated every day with one single aircraft. And very long range flights are a niche : the hours spent in that closed tube discourage passengers from taking such flights. And very long range flights are a hell to schedule : the aircraft does 3 or 4 flights a week, and stays on the tarmac the rest of the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The size of the airline :</p>

<ul>
<li>If your airline is a big one, like British Airways or Japan Airlines or United, your reputation and historical operation is enough to get demand on most usual routes (and your staff has the expertise to select profitable ones) Most of your flights will be the type ""hub-X-hub"", either domestic, regional, or international.</li>
<li>If your airline is above average (like Kenya Airways, Aeromexico, Air India) you'll have a mix of ""hub-X-hub"" flights and some complementary legs to fix schedules and aircraft operation ratio : hub-A-B(-C)-Hub</li>
<li>If your airline is below average (Blue Panorama, Air Kazakstan, Belavia) chances are great to have charter flights, multiple flight shifts.. Timetables greatly vary from one year to another.</li>
<li>Small airlines like Air Austral, Republic Express (Indonesia), Insel Air will have historical regular flights, but most of them will be of type ""hub-A-B-hub"" and/or ""hub-A-C-E-C-B-hub"". Timetables also vary from one year to another, but at a less rate than above because the airline don't have enough aircraft to think of new or better routes to operate, as the ones available cannot be closed or replaced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The region of operation - the airport statistics (passenger volume per year) :</p>

<ul>
<li>There are regions of high frequency of flights : Western Europe, United States, Japan, South-East Asia, Eastern Australia, the Dubai-Europe axis... In those regions, you have several hundreds of round trip routes that can be operated ten times a day using a Boeing 747. Cheap flights, historical demand, dynamic business. You can operate flights of type ""hub-destination-hub"".</li>
<li>There are regions with much less traffic, but enought for one airline to operate the simpliest flights hub-dest-hub. However, once another airline or more decide to compete on the same route, everyone is forced to reconsider the way it operates their fleet.</li>
<li>You also have regions in the world, especially in Africa and some non-democratic countries out there, where only one airline is allowed to operate a given route. Usually, those airlines don't care about competition, as the state/country itself protect them. Ticket prices on those routes are unusually high, because they can. So the demand on those routes NEVER take off, thus, making the flights on them the same along the years. You'll have destinations operated once a week (if not once a month) You'll have very small airlines and you don't understand why, having the monopoly on the network, they are not able to grow, grow the traffic, and propose better schedules for custommers than the absurd routes and departure/arrival times. Simple : they simply don't care.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Night Flights - jet lag.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can't just make an aircraft take off, and land when you want. A custommer usually don't want to land at an airport at 3AM.</li>
<li>An airline <em>should</em> avoid boarding passengers at 5:30AM, just because if you board at that time, you've waken up at 3:00AM, failed to take a breakfast, almost forgot your papers, arrives at the airport hungry and angry...</li>
<li>jet lag : If you take off from San Francisco at 09:00PM, going to New York, you'll land at 06:25AM. It's okay ! But if you take off at 05:15PM, you'll land at 03:40AM. You haven't slept well.. Perhaps at NY, it's okay to land so early in the morning, but try this in Charles de Gaulle and you'll see how boring (or expensive) it will be. Jet lag is an important factor for international flights. When the airline can't have the slots to land at a proper time at the destination airport, it should think of alternate flights to do, or negociate the opening of an intermediate destination of interest before operating the projected flight, this creating legs like ""hub-alternal-hub-destination-hub"" or ""hub-alternate1-alternate2-destination-hub"" or ""hub-alternate-destination-alternate-hub"". Airlines like Air Madagascar does this. Landing at an airport late in the night is another reason of nightstops. This is common with regional jets (737-ERJ-A32x...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Aircraft operated by several airlines.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you'll have aircraft operated by the owner some days in a week, and by another operator the remaining time. Take for example InterAir of South Africa. The aircraft is based at Johannesburg, and operates InterAir flights from and to JNB. But on Wednesday and Friday morning, the aircraft takes off from JNB as an InterAir flight, to Cotonou, and from there, it operates for AeroBenin to several destination in central Africa. The aircraft returns from Cotonou the Thursday and Saturday afternoon as regular InterAir flight. So don't be surprised to find a flight from JNB to Cotonou Wed and Fri morning, and their returning legs on Thu and Sat afternoon. That's common in Africa, South America and Asia. Many airlines like Blue Panorama, Lot Polish, EgyptAir (...) lend some of their aircraft to smaller airlines in the world on a week basis like this. The smaller airlines operate them on routes like ""hub-A-B-C-B-A-hub"" to use the aircraft as long as possible in the few hours/days.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>So, those are only hints to understand how routes as selected and arranged. To enumerate all possible schemes, even a book won't suffice.</p>

<p>It is possible to have much more aircraft than routes (when you have enough demand) or the inverse. An aircraft on the ground is an aircraft that costs money for nothing; so ""hub-X-hub"" flights are rarely the best way to operate an aircraft. Key words are <strong>""demand""</strong>, <strong>""costs""</strong>, <strong>""profit""</strong>. To get factual datas to calculate those, you'll need parameters like aircraft performance, airframe availability, route statistics, crew/maintainance possibilities, security/safety, regulations/laws/authorizations... then compare and negociate the opening of the most profitable route with the less risks with the appropriate aircraft.</p>

<p>Tools and parts were available at the airport in Alicante, but no qualified technician certified for this type of aircraft. The technical staff of the airline contacted his boss in Iceland by phone, who agreed to sub-contract him to the airline for the duration of the repair and pay him overtime for the work.<br>

Not only have they <strong>all</strong> brought the allowed fully loaded carry-on &amp; checked-in luggage weight but exceed the free-limits. They are all willing to pay extra for, say, an additional 10 Kg per person. Let's assume average weight for all passengers.</p>

<li><p>What if everyone has 20 Kg extra? How about 30 Kg? Is there any limit to it? </p></li>
<li><p>Does it add if everyone is overweight?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am asking this in a general context of a non-budget airline.</p>
","<p>To answer the questions as asked,</p>

<ol>
<li>We won't depart over the maximum takeoff weight. We'll do something to bring the takeoff weight down to not exceed the limit.</li>
<li>Generally, people fly as scheduled if at all possible, and as much as possible their bags go on the same plane that they do, and other cargo is a lower priority. There are exceptions; passengers might be denied boarding when the plane is simply too heavy with every one and every thing on board, but this is a last resort and not particularly common.</li>
<li>Total weight is total weight, and the more of it there is, the more limited your options become.  This is explained in more detail below.</li>
<li>If the <em>people</em> are overweight, it's probably not a factor in the numbers, because for scheduled commercial flights, most airlines use average numbers for passengers and their carry-on bags.  So it doesn't matter if they're all skinny or all heavy, they all count for the same ""200 lbs"".  For military charters and sports charters, actual weights are used, and some non-US carriers may use actual weights as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, that's the what; let's discuss the ""why"":</p>

<p>There are a lot of ""it depends"" elements here, but in most cases, what happens is that the amount of other freight that can be carried gets reduced, and in the worst case some of the bags stay behind.  But that's probably fairly uncommon.  It's a <strong><em>very</em></strong> worst-case scenario when you can't even take all the passengers -- pretty rare, in my experience.</p>

<p>Your maximum takeoff weight is limited by one of three limits: </p>

<ul>
<li>a takeoff limit (how much the airplane can weigh to take off &amp; climb out while meeting all of the various requirements), </li>
<li>an enroute limit (essentially, if you lose an engine at some/any point enroute, can you clear all of the terrain along the way to get to a suitable landing site), and </li>
<li>a landing limit (your expected landing weight is no greater than the maximum allowed landing weight).</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, the enroute limit is pretty rare, and if the departure runway is long enough, the landing limit is usually the most restrictive.  So, most of the time, your limit boils down to: basic weight of the aircraft, plus cargo, plus passengers, plus landing fuel, can't exceed the maximum certified landing weight.  The aircraft weighs what it weighs, and a full load of passengers is essentially a given weight (most flights use an ""average"" weight value rather than actual passenger weights).  So the interesting variables are the landing fuel, and the cargo weight (bags plus freight).</p>

<p>If it's a good weather day and no alternate is required, then the required fuel for landing is one number -- let's say 5,000 lbs in a 737, assuming a fairly ""best case"" sort of day.  (Various operators may have slightly different numbers, but this is a high-level explanation, not way down in the details.)  But if the weather is bad, that number can go up: allowing fuel for holding, as well as for a possible diversion to an alternate.  Depending on how bad the weather is and how far away the alternate, minimum landing fuel might be 8,000-10,000 lbs for a 737, or more.</p>

<p>Thus... my maximum landing weight is 144,000 lbs for a 737-800.  If the airplane and the people weigh 125,000 lbs, I have 19,000 lbs left over.  If my landing gas is 5,000, then I can take 14,000 lbs of bags/cargo/whatever -- which is a lot.  If the weather is crummy at the destination and instead my min landing gas is 12,000 lbs, then I'm limited to 7,000 lbs of bags.  If today's flight had 6,000# of bags and 3,000# of cargo, it all goes in the first case, but not in the second, and it's usually easier to let the freight take the next flight than the bags -- it gets expensive to deliver bags that the airline didn't get on the same plane as the passenger!</p>

<p>There can also be instances where the max takeoff weight is more limiting... a high &amp; hot airport and/or short runways can limit how much weight you can take off with.  So perhaps ""today"" where I'm departing, the best that I can do (after considering current winds &amp; temperature and the various runways available) is a max takeoff weight of 165,000#.  If I'm burning 25,000# of gas getting where I'm going, then I'll land at 140,000# -- max landing weight (144k) is no longer the limit, max takeoff weight is.  And the computation now looks at the various weights plus min TAKEOFF fuel compared to the max takeoff weight, rather than weights plus min landing fuel compared to the max landing weight.  But the basic process is essentially the same.</p>

<p>Okay, disclaimer, there are various other things than can come into play that I've glossed over for the sake of simplicity -- max ZFW and improved climb and wet landing runways and plenty of other stuff.  If you're studying for your dispatcher license, this is NOT the answer to address all your what-if's.  It's just an overview.</p>
","30087"
"Are we at peak speed efficiency for jet airliners at Mach 0.85?","8243","","<p>The cruising speed of large jet airliners has not increased in the past four decades. The 747 cruised at Mach 0.85 and the new Dreamliner 787 also cruises at Mach 0.85 even though it was designed 40 years later (1969->2009) and uses advanced, composite materials and more powerful and efficient engines.  Meanwhile, faster airliner designs have been shelved, most notably the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Sonic_Cruiser"">Sonic Cruiser</a> (Mach 0.98).</p>

<p>This seems to indicate that as long as we value fuel efficiency over travel time, that we have reached peak speed efficiency at Mach 0.85 and that the only difference will be the comfort (or discomfort) of travel at that speed.</p>

<p>Are there fixed physical limitations at Mach 0.85 that make this the most efficient speed for jet airliners? Does this mean that even with advances in materials science and jet engine technology, we will not see significant transoceanic speed increases in the foreseeable future - so long as fuel efficiency is primary? Will airline travel forty years from now -- 2054 -- still be at Mach 0.85?</p>
","<p>Short answer: Increasing fuel prices would have driven down the most economical speed, but advances in aerodynamics have compensated for that and the maximum cruise Mach number is still at Mach 0.85. But there is a much simpler reason why this Mach 0.85 number seems so immutable.</p>

<p>Please note that we are talking about the maximum cruise Mach number; all airliners will fly more economical at slightly lower Mach numbers between 0.78 and 0.82. </p>

<p>Now we need to define efficiency. For airliners this is haul capacity per time, and can be expressed by the product of payload, range and speed. When none of the three constituents can be changed without making the product more costly to achieve, you have reached the point of best efficiency.</p>

<h2>Engine Technology</h2>

<p>The biggest change in the last 50 years was in engine technology. Bypass ratios have increased to values close to 10, the turbine inlet temperature is now <a href=""http://www.aircraftenginedesign.com/TableB4.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">300°C higher than in the early jet age</a>, and electronic control has improved especially the off-design performance of engines. This has made it less attractive to increase flight speed, so the optimum cruise Mach would be lower if no other effects had influenced it.</p>

<p>Another effect is the lower fuel consumption. Early designs had to use a high wing chord to pack enough fuel volume for transoceanic flights. The much lower consumption of modern engines has given them ranges which are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stop_flight"" rel=""noreferrer"">more than what is needed to reach every point on earth</a> directly. This made it possible to reduce wing area, thickness and mass, and to save some friction drag, helping fuel economy again. The lower thickness helps to make higher cruise Mach numbers possible.</p>

<h2>Aerodynamics</h2>

<p>Aerodynamics is the second factor. With the A310 supercritical airfoils were introduced, and they shifted the operating Mach number up because now a limited region of supersonic flow on the wing could be tolerated without a significant rise in drag. However, the benefit from that was used to reduce wing sweep, increase airfoil thickness and to attach bigger fuselages to those wings. In the end, the newer airplanes had the same cruise Mach numbers as their predecessors. Something made Mach 0.85 too attractive to abandon.</p>

<p>A second effect of supercritical airfoils is their blunter nose, which helps to reach a higher maximum lift coefficient. This also contributed to reducing wing chord, because now the wing area could be made smaller for the same landing speed.</p>

<h2>The Real Reason</h2>

<p>Every new airliner needs to compete with the older models. On fuel economy this is no problem, but <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3748/why-1st-and-2nd-class-but-not-fast-or-slow-airplanes/3752#3752"">speed is also important</a>. A higher cruise Mach number allows  shorter times for connections. Now you have to know that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(computer_system)"" rel=""noreferrer"">electronic</a> reservation <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_IT_Group#History"" rel=""noreferrer"">systems</a> would list connections sorted by flight time, shortest first. When a travel agent wanted to book a flight, he or she would rarely look beyond the first screen and pick one of the first flights listed. If a new type made the flight slip down in the listings, it was a non-seller. This is even true in the times of online bookings: The airlines don't make much profit from the bargain hunters in Economy, their target are the business people flying in Business or First Class. And those still order mostly through travel agencies, so the rules have not changed. <strong>This</strong> is why that Mach 0.85 speed seems to be so firmly set; flying any faster would drive up fuel consumption disproportionally, and even the newest jets will mostly be flown around Mach 0.82 to Mach 0.84.</p>

<p>Making this speed possible is still a struggle for the design engineers, especially when you consider that larger aircraft would need thicker wings for structural efficiency, but need to be fitted with wings thinner than optimal to let marketing claim a cruise speed of Mach 0.85.</p>

"How does a commercial airliner measure its weight/mass?","8228","","<p>Other questions currently being answered cover situations regarding planes near, at or even above their MTOW. It raises a more basic question: how is the exact ""ramp weight"" of an airliner measured or estimated?</p>

<p>On most airlines, luggage is weighed and counted, so the pilot would know within 100lbs or so how much mass is in his cargo hold. He'd also know the ""operating empty weight"" of the plane itself (the weight of the airframe, all fluids besides usable fuel and the weight of the crew), and the mass of the fuel he's taking on.</p>

<p>The biggest variable, then, is the weight of the passengers and their carryons/personal effects. Last time I flew, I wasn't knowingly weighed and neither was anyone else getting on with me. So, while you know the number of passengers, the total ""cabin weight"" is a big unknown.</p>

<p>So, do planes have load sensors in their gear which could be used to exactly measure the plane's ramp weight? Or is a median passenger and carryon weight used, with a more conservative total passenger rating used in case a few planeloads err on the heavy side of the bell curve?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

<p>Determination of <em>mass and balance</em> (or weight and balance) is a critical task for the crew, an error in this operation may have tragic consequences. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Weighing passengers and carry-on items is mandatory per regulation.<br><br>
Either standard predetermined weights, or actual weights can be used in this operation. Airlines usually use predetermined tables. Tables values take into account different types of travel (e.g. regular and charter).</p></li>
<li><p>While the weight must be checked, the center of gravity location is of equal importance. The distribution of the passengers in the aircraft is also taken into consideration.</p></li>
<li><p>Aircraft are not weighed prior to each flight, but the basic empty weight must be known and checked periodically per regulation.<br><br>
Aircraft are weighed simply using scales under the carriages :-)<br><br>

The other method is to use jacks. See further below for an image.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>So this was the short answer. To understand why and how to balance the aircraft, there are quite a lot elements to introduce. For those interested, just continue!</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Weight...</strong></p>

<p>The different elements composing the takeoff weight:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/65XjJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/65XjJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>  </p>

<p>All of these elements must be determined prior to taxi and takeoff.</p>

<p>The mass of these elements are necessary to check that the different maximum weights are not exceeded. However there is another aspect of the masses which needs to be secured: Where are the masses located?</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking <strong>KeithS</strong>' example, if there are many heavy people grouped in the forward section, we may have a problem at <a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Vr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vr</a>, even if the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_takeoff_weight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MTOW</a> is not exceeded.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>... and balance. Location of the center of gravity vs. the MAC</strong></p>

<p>The masses must be distributed so that the center of gravity of the aircraft is located within limits determined relatively to the aerodynamic chord, and the center of lift.</p>

<p>This is required to ensure the stability and the maneuverability, to minimize the efforts on the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and to increase the maximum lift and reduce the drag. On airliners, the center of lift must be located between the CG and the center of lift of the horizontal stabilizer, so that the latter pushes downward to balance the weight.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ABobH.gif"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p>

<p>On airliners the width of the wing is greatest where it meets the fuselage at the wing root and progressively decreases toward the tip. As a consequence, the chord also changes along the span of the wing. The average length of the chord is known as the mean aerodynamic chord (<a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Mean_Aerodynamic_Chord_%28MAC%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MAC</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/24dY2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
The MAC is a portion of the wing, delimited by LeMAC (leading, 0%) and TeMAC (trailing, 100%). The CG must be located in the MAC.</p>

<p>In large aircraft, center of gravity limitations and the actual center of gravity are often expressed in terms of %MAC (on the roll axis, similar limits exist on the two other axis). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDK5G.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
(image and text around: <a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Aircraft_Design.html?id=VT-Tc3Tx5aEC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aircraft Design, Mohammad H. Sadraey</a>)</p>

<p>In general, in large transport aircraft, the most forward CG is located as forward as 5% MAC, while the most aft location as aft as 40% MAC. The average CG limits in large transport aircraft are between 20 and 30% MAC.</p>

<p>As commented by <strong>Calchas</strong>, using wrong weights for the passengers (adults instead of children) may move the CG to a wrong location, not balanced by the trim, and create strong difficulties during the takeoff and the initial climb.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PAX weight applicable procedures</strong></p>

<p>For an airliner, the PAX portion is relatively small compared to the total mass, so the passengers mass is usually estimated based on standard passenger mass tables and the number of PAX per cabin section. Each airline may provide its own standard mass tables, but standard tables are proposed with the applicable regulation:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Special cases</strong></p>

<p>There are cases where it is obvious the actual mass and balance will be erroneous if the standard tables are used (this is especially true for a small cabin).</p>

<p>In these cases the operator must improve the evaluation by actual weighing of either all or a sample of passengers and their baggage.

<p><strong>Putting all elements together</strong></p>

<p>All masses, arms (distance to the reference center) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_%28physics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">moments</a> are finally reported on the aircraft manifest to calculate the correction that must be used for the takeoff (trim amount).</p>

<p><strong>Basic empty weight determination</strong></p>

"Is an alternate airport always required when flying internationally?","8224","","<p>When flying a domestic US flight, an alternate airport is not required unless the weather is below specific minimums at the destination.</p>

<p>What are the rules when on an international flight plan and leaving or returning to the US?</p>

<p>In larger airplanes, carrying the extra fuel required to fly to an alternate (which costs money) is a little silly when there isn't a cloud in the sky and there are multiple airports in the vicinity of your destination that can be easily reached with your already required 45 minute IFR reserve.  We should always have a plan for when things go wrong, but if it can be done safely, is it <strong><em>legal</em></strong> to file an international flight plan without an alternate? </p>
","<p>As a simple anwer, no, it is not always required.</p>

<p><strong>ICAO Annex 6 4.3.4.3 Destination alternate aerodromes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a flight to be conducted in accordance with the instrument flight
  rules, at least one destination alternate aerodrome shall be selected
  and specified in the operational and ATS flight plans, unless: </p>
  
  <p>a) the
  duration of the flight and the meteorological conditions prevailing
  are such that there is reasonable certainty that, at the estimated
  time of arrival at the aerodrome of intended landing, and for a
  reasonable period before and after such time, the approach and landing
  may be made under visual meteorological conditions; or </p>
  
  <p>b) the
  aerodrome of intended landing is isolated and there is no suitable
  destination alternate aerodrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, there are similar descriptions for the requirements for take-off and en-route alternates.</p>

<p>EASA adds aditional requirements in <strong>OPS 1.295</strong> in the form of maximum flight time of 6 hours and at least two runways at the airport, but it is still allowed. I can only assume FAA does a similar thing</p>

"Why are visual approaches (in the US) preferred by US pilots, but not European pilots?","8214","","<p>I listen to ATC a lot and often hear airliners cleared for visual approaches in the USA. Interestingly, if it's European airliner pilots they deny the visual approach and request ILS even if they are in an emergency and probably should land ASAP. Why is that? Are European pilots not used to hand flying? I assume pilots flying, for example, A380, should have extremely good piloting skills. What is the problem with doing a simple visual approach?</p>

<p>I also haven't heard yet from ATC to clear an airliner for a visual approach in Europe.</p>

<p>Here is the audio source (via <a href=""https://youtu.be/TxlIwGAeiFI"" rel=""noreferrer"">YouTube</a>): 30% of time is spent dealing with turning ILS on for 31L.</p>
","<p>If a visual approach is offered, and it gets accepted by the pilot, the airport can declare higher capacity. Whereas IFR procedures reduce the airport's capacity.</p>

<p>US and European airports handle their slots differently. Europe plans for the worst, which can on good days limit the full potential. The US plans for the best, which can on bad days end up in huge delays.* I've also <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/38155/14897"">explained it here</a>. In short, if in the US they started offering more IFR procedures during good weather (VMC), they won't be able to back up the declared capacity.</p>

<p>Generally, airports are closer to the cities in Europe than in the US (apart from coastal cities) due to the different city planning (old vs. new). Airports in close proximity to cities have approach procedures that are designed for noise abatement, and are best flown as precisely as published.</p>

<p>So in general, the pilots are used to different systems. Also pilots that don't fly a lot in the US—like foreign carriers—are not as familiar with the surroundings as local pilots are.</p>

<p>It's not about skills, it's about knowing what to look for, especially when a particular visual approach does not have a visual approach chart.</p>

<p>Regarding the specific video about the bomb threat and the pilot's request to have the ILS turned on, for that scenario in particular it's because an ILS approach is less demanding, especially in such high workload environment. (Also the flight was diverting mid-route.)</p>

I think I've seen it happen sometimes, but the majority of my flights are on 737s and are just loaded from the front entrance. </p>
","<p>The aviation industry is already running at near-peak efficiency, performing crucial tasks simultaneously to ensure quick turn-around.  Trying to speed up the boarding process by allowing entrance from both ends would be doable with a large amount of changes to the existing process, in both operations and infrastructure.  However, the result would be horrendous and time- and resource-consuming at worst and comical at best.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jetways need to be able to reach all points of ingress/egress, where currently, they only reach the forward doors.  Seeing as aircraft nose-in at the gate, to reach the aft doors would require a jetway that goes <em>around</em> the wing (<em>above</em> the wing is even less practical from a design/physics standpoint), effectively creating an even smaller limit to the size of the aircraft that can fit at the terminal since there is now a jetway that needs to reach the rear doors.  As you can see, the space between aircraft is already tight:  <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sGxM3.jpg"" alt=""aft-capable jetway"">Or, you use a simple stairway at the aft door and <em>allow passengers on the tarmac</em>, an already busy place during aircraft turn-around, and we don't need them touching anything en route.  I highly recommend against the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>In many instances, during boarding, the rear and/or opposite-side doors are already in use for loading/unloading food and drinks and taking out the trash.  So you'd have to redesign that process.</p></li>
<li><p>Humans are generally stupid in large groups.  Southwest notwithstanding, your typical airline assigns seats.  Imagine a passenger entering the rear door with seat 1A.  It doesn't have to be that extreme.  It can be any seat assignment more forward than another passenger coming the opposite direction down the aisle, which has the effect of halting both directions of travel.  Passengers already sit in the wrong seats, or travel with babies, or carry too much luggage (or stow it selfishly).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There have been many studies on efficient boarding methods.  The most efficient algorithm seems to be <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5211v1"">the Steffen Method</a>, but this method requires someone with an inordinate attention to detail (and willing passengers) to line people up in a specific order.  Taking into account crew resources, the most efficient method is by window-middle-aisle groups, then by random order (i.e. ""single-zone""), with typical ""zone boarding"" least efficient.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>There are scenarios where boarding from both ends makes sense and is feasible, e.g. smaller planes with fewer passengers.  On larger aircraft, the problem compounds itself as the number of passengers grows, each ""collision"" incident affecting that many more people in the queue.  Minimizing collisions requires airlines to throw more resources at the problem, namely personnel to direct traffic.  Ask any CFO - more often than not, human resources is the most significant slice of the operating budget.  </p>

<p>In any case, engineering a solution should not entail best-case scenarios; it should be designed for typical-case at best, and more commonly for worst-case.  The human factor is one that cannot be overlooked.  There is no such thing as an idiot-proof system.</p>

<p>This is always a dangerous thing. Only because you hear more bird strikes that occur on takeoff, it does not mean there <strong>are</strong> more at takeoff.</p>

<p>I found, for example, <a href=""http://davvl.de/Voluenglisch/2003/Hild.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this report</a> about bird strikes from the year 2000. It says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] <strong>38%</strong> of the bird strikes occurred during take-off
  and climb, and <strong>56%</strong> during approach [...]</p>

<p>That means there are <strong>more</strong> bird strikes during approach than on takeoff. I assume things haven't changed a lot since then.</p>

<p>This question is even answered in the <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/wildlife/faq/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wildlife FAQ Section of the FAA</a>:</p>

<h2>Possible reason for subjective perception of bird-strikes happening more often during departure</h2>

<p>I thought a little about it and came to following possible reason: After a bird-strike on final, the pilots will continue landing. It would be unwise not to land immediately. For the passengers it will look like a normal landing. If the bird damages the engine, there is only a small change of sound, because the engines are running very low.</p>

<p>However, when a bird-strike occurs while taking off, there is immediate action taken by the pilots. And because the engines are at or near full thrust, the sound of a dying engine can be perceived by the passengers. Last but not least, a departing aircraft has a much higher speed than a landing one, which means more damage.</p>

<p>So, for newspapers, a bird-strike at take-off is more <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/terror-airasia-flight-after-bird-10733303"" rel=""noreferrer"">dramatic and drama sells</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>More damage to the plane than a bird-strike on final</li>
<li>Passengers not reaching their destination</li>
<li>Dramatic passenger interviews about their ""near-death-experience""</li>
</ul>

<p>A newspaper is not interested in a bird-strike on final, where everything went fine and no passenger noticed anything.</p>

<p>To support my theorem, I googled ""bird strike"" and clicked on the ""News""-tab. I looked through every article that had to do something with an bird-strike incident. 5 out of 6 articles were about a bird-strike on take-off. That's over 80%.</p>

","<p>The fuselages are circular (or nearly circular) in shape for two <a href=""http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">main reasons</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The main reason is that for a circular cross section, the pressure loads are resisted by tension, rather than by bending loads in non-circular sections. Also, the non-circular sections have stress concentrations when pressurized, which may lead to failure.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of a circular design, the flow will not separate under small (to moderate) angles of attack and in sideslip.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In case of non-pressurized aircraft, the fuselages are dictated by volume constraints and are usually rectangular in shape as it is more efficient in space utilization.</p>

"Why turn off pitot tube heating?","8163","","<p>I'm merely an amateur simulator (X-Plane) pilot. On a flight yesterday the airspeed indicator stopped working. After the initial panic I remembered reading something about pitot tubes freezing, found the pitot heating switch, and turned it on. The problem was resolved immediately.</p>

<p>This led me to think: Is there a good reason to not turn pitot heating on before take-off, and leave it on for the entire flight?</p>

<p><sup>EDIT: I'm flying a Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle</sup></p>
","<p>The aircraft checklist will determine when the pitot heat should be on. Strictly speaking, if the checklist says it should be on, the only reason it should not be on is if the system is inoperative or is causing some issue (if the generator system fails it will drain the battery, as falstro commented). The checklist linked by Lnafziger has the pitot heat ON before takeoff and OFF after landing. Other times it may be ""as required"" by conditions.</p>

<p>The pitot heat makes sure the pitot system remains free of ice. Failed airspeed, especially in IFR conditions, can be serious. The failure may not be obvious, leaving you to stall/overspeed. Leaving the heat on can cause the system to overheat. While some systems automatically protect against this, not all will (especially with smaller aircraft).</p>

<p>Checklists for larger jets also seem to have probe heat on before taxi and off right before shutdown. The reason for this is probably safety. Modern aircraft rely heavily on pitot static systems. AF447 crashed partially due to icing on the pitot tubes. Why leave it off and run the risk of icing? The cost of leaving it on is fairly low.</p>

<p>On smaller aircraft where the pilot may even be able to see the pitot tubes, the situation may be different. These aircraft have less automation, and the cost of repairing a pitot heat system is higher relative to the rest of the aircraft's maintenance. However, the issue of safety remains.</p>

"Do box-wings suffer from induced drag the same way as normal wings?","8152","","<p>Most wings suffer from induced drag due to a pressure difference above and below the wing causing air to sneak around the tip, forming a vortex. There are various methods to minimize these effects, such as winglets.</p>

<p>However, looking at the <a href=""http://www.synergyaircraft.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Synergy aircraft</a> as an example, box wings have no wing tips. Disregarding any other parts of the aircraft, are the wings actually free from induced drag? Or are they still causing induced drag, just in a way I'm not able to think of with my limited fluid dynamics experience?</p>

<p><a href=""http://synergyaircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Synergy_wide.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Synergy aircraft with box wings http://synergyaircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Synergy_wide.jpg</a></p>

<p>I've read somewhere that a traditional bi-plane design is less efficient due to the wings interfering with each other (apparently something addressed by the synergy aircraft by placing the upper wing further back or something), and the upper wing is actually more of a tail-plane, pushing down, thus further increasing the airspeed in between the airfoils if I understand correctly and eliminating the pressure differential from the top of the upper wing to the bottom of the lower wing, and both wings would of course generate normal drag by cutting through the air, but I'm only interested in the induced drag at this point.</p>
","<p>The box wing is only better when you compare wings with identical span. The two wings of a box wing work in different <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefftz_plane"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Treffz planes</a>, so the downwash is spread out vertically. The difference in induced drag to a single wing is not big, just a few percent. The friction drag is higher (see below), as is the structural mass, so the box wing needs to create more lift. This makes the induced drag of a box wing effectively higher than that of a single wing.</p>

<p>What is <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7528/why-is-the-use-of-tail-down-force-so-common/7529#7529"">induced drag</a>, anyway? It is the consequence of creating lift over a limited span. The wing creates lift by deflecting air downwards. This happens gradually over the wing's chord, and creates a reaction force orthogonally to the local speed of air. This means the reaction force is pointing up- and slightly backwards. This backwards component is induced drag! Wingtips are not involved and are not causing induced drag. Lift creation is.</p>

<p>If you fly fast, there is a lot of air mass streaming past the wing per unit of time, so you need to deflect the air only slightly. Your induced drag is small. Sames goes for a large span: There is more air which can be deflected, so the induced drag is small.</p>

<p>A box wing needs two slim wings per side, which will have a smaller chord than a single wing of the same surface area. So their Reynolds number is smaller, and their friction drag is higher. Also, the wing spar is less thick and will need to be heavier to carry the same lift!</p>

<p>If you drop the restriction of keeping span identical, the optimum single wing can afford to have more span (due to its better structural efficiency), and away goes the advantage of the box wing. And once you look at the full picture and add structural mass, the box wing never had this advantage in the first place.</p>

<h2>Yes, but what about the Synergy?</h2>

<p>The Synergy is a clever design with some advantages, but it cannot cheat physics. These are the advantanges:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pusher prop keeps the airframe free of wake turbulence, so more area can be kept in laminar flow.</li>
<li>The pusher prop sucks the air from the rear fuselage, effectively avoiding separation.</li>
<li>The two stubby tailbooms and fins give great protection for the propeller area on the ground.</li>
<li>The compact layout keeps the stabilizing effect of the propeller small, so maneuverability does not suffer much.</li>
<li>The use of composites and glider airframe technologies reduce friction drag.</li>
<li>The diesel engine consumes cheaper jet fuel and is more fuel-efficient than a gasoline engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I did not mention the box wing design?</p>

<p>Here are the disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wing sweep in a propeller aircraft looks cool, but increases drag, because the wing must be bigger to create the same lift.</li>
<li>In total, this configuration has four vertical tails, each of them with its own interference drag and a short chord which, again, increases drag over a comparable single vertical tail.</li>
<li>The stretched-out horizontal tail is also less effective than a smaller single surface with more chord and more distance from the center of gravity.</li>
<li>The compact layout provides little pitch or yaw damping. I wonder what the ride qualities in gusty weather are.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would expect that a more conventional layout along the lines of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaflieg_Stuttgart_FS-28_Avispa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fs-28</a> would be even more efficient.</p>

<p>So, if I'm in the US, under VFR (code 1200) and I enter a Secondary Surveillance Area, I automatically change to Code 2000? Why wouldn't I have already been given (a specific) designator?</p>
","<p>The purpose of squawk code 2000 is to prevent aircraft entering a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) area from transmitting a code that is the same as a discrete code assigned by ATC to an individual aircraft.</p>

<p>If you are flying in the USA under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), you will be assigned (implicitly) code 1200. Upon entering a SSR area you might get assigned another code, but often you will keep code 1200 if you are not near class C airspace.</p>

<p>If you are flying Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) outside a SSR area (e.g. entry into the US from oceanic airspace), you will use code 2000. Upon radar contact you will then get assigned a discrete code. </p>

<p>Another use of code 2000 is on the airport: before power up you can select code 2000 to avoid code conflicts that could occur when you would maintain your code from a previous flight. It is standard practice in many airlines to select code 2000 after arrival at the gate. </p>

"Why do flight attendants continue to stand, when the seatbelt sign is on?","8118","","<p>Especially during turbulence, I notice that passengers are warned to sit and fasten seatbelts, but flight attendants continue to serve only cold beverages (since the overflow, slosh, spill of hot beverages would be dangerous), stand, walk, and work. Why? It appears unfair for flight attendants to suffer any more risk and danger, even if the turbulence is minor, than passengers. </p>
","<p>I worked as a flight attendant for several years and I am still employed within the industry but in a different capacity, so I know a thing or two about this topic.</p>

<p>Flight Attendants (FAs) are strictly required to be seated during take-off and landings only and usually not during descent or climb, unlike passengers who are usually required to be seated and buckled. Then it depends on the local rules for how long they are supposed to stay there. In some airlines, the FAs must sit as long as the seatbelt sign is lit, while in others they can move about once the gears are up (you can hear this easily, as they make a loud sound when they are retracted). Other airlines might state FAs can move once the plane reaches a certain altitude and/or are given some sort of sign from the cockpit.</p>

<p>There is not one type of turbulence, but various classifications. Some of them are just light (small bounciness) and some are dangerous and can injure (or kill) people who are not seated and buckled. It is usually cabin crew who are the victims (I have personally been through this kind of turbulence). </p>

<p>Usually, pilots will, during the <a href=""http://www.cabincrew.com/career-advice/what-happens-at-a-cabin-crew-pre-flight-briefing/1161"">pre-flight briefing</a>, brief the cabin crew of any expected turbulence and will usually say something like: ""seatbelts are for everybody"" or ""seatbelts are for passengers"". If things during the flight end up different from the forecast that was given to the pilots prior to the flight, the pilots will call the cabin crew and inform them. They will tell the cabin crew whether to continue the service because it is a light turbulence, they may suggest only to serve cold beverages, or tell the FAs to sit tight and secure everything if approaching severe turbulence. </p>

<p>This is basically the ""secret"" behind it. There is no magical training given to cabin crew on how to defeat the laws of physics and stand balanced while in turbulence; it is just the word from the pilots as they are the most knowledgeable about the weather conditions. The crew are only trained on types of turbulence and on how to secure the cabin and service carts quickly in case of sudden severe turbulence that was not detected in advance. In that case, they are told to hang on to anything and secure themselves.</p>

<p>Passengers, on the other hand, are required to be seated and buckled during all phases of the flight except cruise and when there is no turbulence. This is simply due to liability and not to add more complication in these critical times.</p>

<p>I do not know the intensity of cyclonic wind at 10km above sea level, but my limited understanding on the subject suggest that the wind is strongest near the surface and weakens with height. If a small plane with high service ceiling can fly over such a powerful storm. Is it possible for a larger plane with a lower service ceiling to fly into a cyclone unscathed?</p>

<p>Considering that most pilots would try to go around a cyclone and that safety regulations may also forbid pilots from putting their passengers in any kind of risk that airlines do not want to bear, by just strictly looking at the aerodynamics and aeronautics of the aircraft, is it feasible for large commercial planes like 747 to fly into a tropical cyclone?</p>
","<p>If the wind shear (sometimes called wind gradient, which in my opinion is the better term) encountered in that part of the cyclone the aircraft is penetrating is less than what the aircraft can handle, then, yes, an aircraft can safely fly into a cyclone.</p>

<p>What the aircraft can handle varies greatly depending on the speed at which it is being flown. Large aircraft have a recommended turbulence penetration speed, both in terms of knots and mach. In the absence of such a recommendation, V speeds that are relevant are Va, Vb, and Vo. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds</a> is a good V speed terminology reference.</p>

<p>I do not know what typical wind gradient values within a cyclone are or what their distribution within the cyclonic area is. However, I would be surprised if they were significantly greater than gradients within tropical thunderstorms, and aircraft do penetrate such.</p>

<p>In season there's a roughly north-south line of thunderstorms that regularly develops between Sumatra and Sri Lanka with tops greater than 50,000 feet. Lacking the fuel to go around the line, we would regularly go through it using radar to avoid the worst. However, with those old radars (back in the 1990s in 747s), it was not uncommon for us to wind up in a cell.</p>

"Why do some aircraft have multiple ailerons per wing?","8083","","<p>In a recent flight on an Airbus A380 I noticed that its ailerons are split into three segments which move independently. </p>

<p>What advantages does this design have? Do other aircraft have split ailerons (or other control surfaces)?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4fqp.jpg"" alt=""Multiple ailerons on an Airbus A380""></p>
","<h2>General Reasons</h2>

<p>There are three main reasons for having multiple ailerons per wing on large aircraft:</p>

<h3>Aileron Reversal</h3>

<p>On a large aircraft, at high speeds the material of the aileron can be flexed so much as to nullify or even reverse the direction of change of lift, which causes significant issues. The further out on the wing an aileron is, the more it is subject to these forces. For high-speed aircraft, this necessitates an outboard/inboard aileron, with the outboard being locked out at a certain speed limit. On the Airbus A380, the downwards motion of the outward aileron is locked out at 240 KIAS, and upward motion at 300 KIAS.</p>

<h3>Systems Redundancy</h3>

<p>Another issue is that on most large aircraft, it is simply infeasible to have cables running through the aircraft, requiring the use of hydraulics. Having ailerons split would allow for more redundancy of system failures, allowing more controllability in these failure conditions.</p>

<h3>Load Alleviation Function</h3>

<p>Building on what Bret Copeland has already discussed in his answer, multiple ailerons can be used by fly-by-wire computers to flex the aircraft's wings in a specific manner to allow for less loading on the wing during cruise (counteracts the wing's natural tendency to flex upwards), as well as allowing for dynamic turbulence alleviation.</p>

<p>One of the examples of using this is in Airbus's Safety First magazine (<a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/2275.pdf"">July 2012</a>), where they use the flexibility of having three ailerons to tune out lateral accelerations in the rear of the aircraft changing the gains of each of the controls. By being able to move the centre aileron a fraction after the inner aileron, they managed to avoid these initial shifts during flight testing of the A380.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Other Aircraft</h2>

<p>The majority of airliners have multiple ailerons, however in some instances (such as the Airbus A310), there is no outboard aileron -- this function is replaced by spoilers.</p>

<p>Another example of using computers on multiple ailerons is the Boeing 747-8, with the use of the outboard aileron to fix issues relating to the development of flutter in certain extremes of the flight envelope, called the Outboard Aileron Modal Suppression (OAMS) system.</p>

"How precise are altimeters?","8082","","<p>How precise and how accurate are typical altimeters these days? That is, if two planes are flying (side-by-side, very near each other), and both altimeters show the same Flight Level, what is the maximum vertical difference in actual altitude you would expect to see between them? (I.e. is it on the order of a few meters, a few tens of meters, etc?) Is there any legal standard for precision/accuracy of the altimeter that must be met (let's say in the US)?</p>
","<p>While Accuracy and Precision are closely related, they're not the same thing.<br>
In the context of your question <em>both</em> are important:</p>

<h2>Accuracy</h2>

<p>In the US altimeters are broadly required to comply with <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=&amp;r=PART&amp;n=14y1.0.1.3.21#14:1.0.1.3.21.0.363.14.57"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAR 43 Appendix E</a> limits for <em>accuracy</em> (technically this is regulatory for IFR flight, but TSO'd ""sensitive altimeters"" will generally meet these requirements - at least when they left the factory - and that's what you're going to find in most aircraft).</p>

<p>The accuracy requirements provided in FAR 43 are based on mechanical altimeters, and are subject to a number of requirements (friction error limits, hysterisis limits, etc.), but the test tables there are a good guide to the accuracy of ""typical"" altimeters.</p>

<p>Also note that the accuracy of sensitive altimeters depends on the pressure setting the pilot enters (an incorrect pressure setting could mean substantial error). In ""the flight levels"" everyone uses the same standard altimeter setting (29.92 inches of mercury / 1013 millibars) to avoid this issue (similarly the ATC transponder transmits an altitude assuming a pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury - ATC's computers correct that value based on local altimeter settings as required).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on the design digital altimeters may also be immune to some of the accuracy-affecting issues in an analog/mechanical altimeter - for example a solid-state digital altimeter should not suffer from ""friction error"" as there's no rotating/moving shaft involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Precision</h2>

<p>Analog altimeters are ""reasonably precise"" -- take this example:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwT7Y.jpg"" alt=""It&#39;s an altimeter!""><br>
The tick marks are every 20 feet. One could easily eyeball 20 foot increments, and even 10 foot increments (with the pointer directly between two ticks). Similarly the pressure settings are marked every 0.02 inches of mercury (or 1mb), allowing for a fairly precise setting of the value.  </p>

<p>Digital altimeters are <em>extremely</em> precise (often offering one-foot precision in their display, and 0.01 inches of mercury for the pressure setting).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe the precision requirements for altimeter markings are specified in the relevant TSOs, but I don't have those documents handy.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>In both cases the precision of the markings can exceed the accuracy of the device: At 10,000 feet the FARs allow an 80 foot tolerance, and whether your measurement is presented as a needle position (roughly to the nearest 10 feet) or a number (to the nearest foot) you could still be 79 feet higher or lower than you ""think"" you are and be ""within tolerance"".</p>

<p>So, combining all of this together - If we have two aircraft flying along indicating the same altitude (say 10,000 feet) and both altimeters are <em>perfect</em> there will be zero feet of vertical separation between them (the static ports of each aircraft will be at the exact same altitude).<br>
On the other hand if both aircraft are at the outer edge of tolerance (one +80ft, one -80ft) there will be 160 feet of vertical separation between them (discounting visual ""slop"" in the analog altimeter and assuming the pointer is <em>perfectly</em> on the line and the pressure setting is <em>perfectly</em> dialed in).</p>

<p>(In either case the answer would be ""WAY TOO CLOSE!"")</p>

"Why is landing on a carrier not handled by a computer?","8038","","<p>Landing on a carrier seems like a difficult and risky task for military pilots, especially at night when the carrier should keep low profile and is practically unlit.</p>

<p>The sensors and processing that the UAV uses to do this are probably not all standard equipment on naval aircraft. Adding them would create extra expense and weight. If the system requires addition to the carrier as well, there is more added expense. And in a combat situation, do you want to rely on systems that could be jammed or failed? If you are going to land the plane without a pilot, you might as well not have the pilot at all, and this is the route that future unmanned systems are taking, but there is a lot more work to be done before they completely replace human pilots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>inspection, overhaul, repair, preservation, and the replacement of parts, but excluding preventive maintenance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am sure that the other regulatory bodies have their own, similar lists.</p>

<p>I know that an aircraft overhaul is one of the major processes involved in (especially commercial) aircraft maintenance. What exactly is meant by overhaul? What is done to an aircraft when it is overhauled? And finally, why is it so important for an aircraft?</p>
","<p>Briefly, ""overhaul"" isn't a strictly defined term but it's generally used to refer to the intensive inspection, maintenance and repair of an aircraft component, frequently - but not exclusively - the engines.</p>

<p>The word overhaul by itself is a general term that's used in all sorts of places but it's not defined in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1"" rel=""nofollow"">14 CFR 1.1</a>, for example. The most specific definition I could find is in <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/international/bilateral_agreements/baa_basa_listing/media/Maint_Annex_2_Extract.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this agreement</a> between the FAA and EASA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Overhaul"" means a process that ensures the aeronautical article is
  in complete conformity  with the applicable service tolerances
  specified  in the type certificate  holder's, or equipment 
  manufacturer's instructions for  continued airworthiness, or in  the
  data which is approved or  accepted by the Authority.</p>
  
  <p>No person may
  describe an article as being overhauled unless it  has been at least 
  disassembled, cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary, reassembled
  and tested in accordance  with the above-specified data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that that definition only mentions ""aeronautical articles"", which is very broad indeed and not limited to just engines, airframes or anything else.</p>

<p>In the general aviation world, a very common usage of ""overhaul"" is in the context of piston engines, which have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_between_overhaul"" rel=""nofollow"">Time Between Overhaul</a> (TBO or TBOH) set by the manufacturer. Once an engine reaches that number of hours, it needs to be overhauled. But even there, the term isn't precise and the FAA has a circular called <em>Reciprocating Engine Overhaul Terminology and Standards</em> that explains what it usually means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. Overhaul.  In the general aviation industry, the term engine
  overhaul has two  identifications that make a  distinction between the
  degrees of work on an engine:</p>
  
  <p>(1) Major Overhaul.  A major overhaul
  consists of the complete disassembly of an  engine. The overhaul
  facility inspects the engine, repairs it as necessary, reassembles,
  tests, and  approves it for return to service within the  fits and
  limits specified by the manufacturer’s  overhaul data. This could be
  to new fits and limits or serviceable limits. The engine owner  should
  clearly understand what fits and limits should be used when  the
  engine is presented for  overhaul. The owner should also be aware of
  any replaced parts, regardless of condition, as a  result of a
  manufacturer’s overhaul data,  SB, or an Airworthiness Directive (AD).</p>
  
  <p>(2) Top Overhaul.  Top overhaul consists of repair to  parts outside
  of the crankcase, and  can be accomplished without completely
  disassembling the entire engine. It can include the  removal of
  cylinders, inspection and repair to cylinders, inspection and repair
  to cylinder walls,  pistons, valve-operation mechanisms, valve guides,
  valve seats, and the replacement of piston  and piston rings. All
  manufacturers do not recommend a top overhaul. Some manufacturers 
  indicate that a powerplant requiring work to this extent  should
  receive a complete overhaul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from that usage, the term <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"" rel=""nofollow"">MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul)</a> seems to be <a href=""http://www.airbus.com/support/maintenance-engineering/"" rel=""nofollow"">used</a> in the airline industry to describe maintenance facilities, but there isn't any specific definition that I could find.</p>

<p>So there's no single definition of ""overhaul"". It just means that you've very thoroughly inspected and tested something on an aircraft, whether it's an engine or a wheel, and you've verified that it's fit to be used in flight, i.e. it's airworthy. The reasons why it's important are probably obvious; they're the same reasons that your car needs regular servicing to run safely, efficiently and reliably.</p>

"What special handling characteristics or techniques do biplanes have?","8026","","<p>How does flying a biplane differ from flying a monoplane? Apart from the increased drag and lift, how does it handle differently, and what effect does that have on manoeuvring?</p>

<p>In particular, I'm interested in differences between a biplane and a hypothetical <em>equivalent</em> monoplane, not differences between vintage airplanes and modern ones, or differences between aerobatic and utility airplanes.</p>
","<h2>Short answer:</h2>

<p>For clarification: Equivalence between biplane and monoplane means than both have the same wing area and the same engine. Then the main <strong>differences in maneuvering</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The biplane has better roll acceleration than an equivalent monoplane.</li>
<li>The biplane has a higher roll rate than an equivalent monoplane at the same speeds.</li>
<li>All biplane flying takes place at lower speeds, resulting in a lower space requirement for all maneuvers. This also means that inertial effects are less pronounced: When pulling up, there is less kinetic energy available for climbing, so (for example) hammerhead turns will end with less altitude gain.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Differences in handling</strong>: The biplane has</p>

<ul>
<li>lower aileron forces for the same roll rate at the same speed</li>
<li>lighter control forces overall due to lower flight speed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Differences in performance</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>shorter take-off and landing distances</li>
<li>a lower stall speed</li>
<li>a much lower maximum speed</li>
<li>a lower optimum cruise speed and range</li>
<li>a lower power requirement due to the lower flying speeds, or if both use the same engine, a better power-to-weight ratio</li>
</ul>

<p>when compared to an equivalent monoplane. These differences are most pronounced if the airplane carries just the pilot and not much payload.</p>

<p>Flying techniques are the same as for monoplanes. Indirectly, differences are likely due to differences in design. Example: Few biplanes profit from having a retractable landing gear while gear retraction makes sense for monoplanes with higher power loading (installed power relative to wing area).</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>Biplanes have two major differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smaller wing span at the same wing area, and</li>
<li>Wire bracing results in very lightweight biplane wings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The smaller span reduces roll damping and roll inertia, so a biplane will accelerate into a roll more quickly than an equivalent monoplane and will reach a higher roll rate. This is the main difference in maneuvering.</p>

<p>The smaller wing span results in more induced drag if both have the same mass and the same speed. With wire bracing, this condition is unrealistic, and an equivalent biplane will be much lighter. If the structure is a substantial part of the aircraft's mass (this is typical for aerobatic airplanes), the result can easily be less induced drag, despite the lower span, and also lower wing loading. This in turn means that both fly at different speeds: The biplane will be able to fly much slower, but the aerodynamic drag of the bracing will restrict it to low speeds. This also means inertial effects are less pronounced: The lower mass <strong>and</strong> lower speed of the biplane combine for a marked difference to the equivalent monoplane.</p>

<p>For aerobatic displays this is ideal: All action takes place close to the audience, and the biplane will need a much smaller area for all maneuvers than an equivalent, but heavier monoplane. The downside are low maximum speed and low range.</p>

<p>Another difference in performance are much shorter take-off and landing distances due to the lower wing loading, which results in a lower stall speed. The optimum endurance and optimum range speeds are lower than those of an equivalent monoplane as well, so all biplane flying happens at lower speeds, which is beneficial for training aircraft.</p>

<p>Since control forces are proportional to dynamic pressure, a biplane will have lower control forces than an equivalent monoplane. Here equivalence also means that the relative chord of all control surfaces is the same. In reality, a good designer will select a higher relative chord for the biplane's control surfaces to ensure that control forces are above their required minimum.</p>

<p>The heavy, unreliable engines of the early years made biplanes the ideal way of taking to the air. Once engines became more powerful and allowed higher payloads, the monoplane became better suited to carrying passengers and freight at higher speeds and over longer distances.</p>

"What's the point of intercepting an aircraft?","7989","","<p>I know that it's possible for military aircraft to ""intercept"" a civilian or foreign aircraft (and I'm well aware of the US interception procedures), but why would they be  doing it in the first place? </p>

<p>What does it actually prevent from occurring?  </p>

<p>They can't remotely control the aircraft, so is there anything that they can do once they intercept it?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sItbi.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The most common reason for interception is that an aircraft is not communicating with ATC and is somewhere that they aren't supposed to be.  Often times it turns out to be unintentional with the aircraft on a VFR flight (i.e. poor flight planning or deviating for weather) and straying into a restricted or prohibited area.</p>

<p>In these cases, the standard intercept signals (<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0506.html#XiC212ROBE"">AIM 5-6-4</a>) are designed to attract the pilot's attention and have them proceed out of the area.  In addition to the ""standard"" signals, they can also drop flares in front of the airplane to really get their attention if needed.</p>

<p>In cases where the airplane still doesn't respond <strong>and</strong> the aircraft appears to be a threat to national security, the decision can be made by a few senior military and civilian officials to actually shoot down the aircraft.  </p>

<hr>

<p>For more detail, in the US section <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0506.html"">5-6-2</a> of the AIM gives the following reasons that a civil aircraft may be intercepted by a military aircraft:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>5-6-2. Interception Procedures</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>a. General.</strong></p>
  
  <p>1. In conjunction with the FAA, Air Defense Sectors monitor air traffic and could order an intercept in the interest of national
  security or defense. Intercepts during peacetime operations are vastly
  different than those conducted under increased states of readiness.
  The interceptors may be fighters or rotary wing aircraft. The reasons
  for aircraft intercept include, but are not limited to:</p>
  
  <p>(a) Identify an aircraft;</p>
  
  <p>(b) Track an aircraft;</p>
  
  <p>(c) Inspect an aircraft;</p>
  
  <p>(d) Divert an aircraft;</p>
  
  <p>(e) Establish communications with an aircraft.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flightgear.org also has a good <a href=""http://wiki.flightgear.org/Aircraft_interception#Reasons_for_interception_in_real_life"">wiki on interception procedures</a> that covers some of the common reasons that they are used (and includes all of the ones that I was going to include):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reasons for interception in real life</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Civilian aircraft</strong></p>
  
  <p>While interception of civilian aircraft is a last resort, interception
  is often the only means available to identify an aircraft that have
  not filed a flight plan and/or have no transponder and can not be
  contacted. Apart from identification interception is as well often the
  only means to redirect an aircraft that is straying into limited
  airspace or is believed to be involved in illegal activities.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Identification</strong><br>
  Visual identification of aircraft that can not otherwise be identified.</p>

"Why are the F/A-18 rudders deflected in opposing directions during takeoff?","7986","","<p>Looking at some videos and photos of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet"" rel=""noreferrer"">F/A-18 Hornets</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Super Hornets</a> taking off from carriers and from airfields, I recognised that the left rudder is pointing right, and the right rudder pointing left.</p>

<p>Here's a picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtYhn.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtYhn.jpg"" alt=""Enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Why is that? Are there any aerodynamic advantages?</li>
<li>Is it also used as an airbrake to slow the plane down at landings?</li>
<li>At which point of the flights are the rudders in this position and why? (Takeoff, landing, cruising, or both?)</li>
<li>Does the pilot steer them or is the work done by a computer?</li>
</ul>
","<h2>Living Wing</h2>

<p>The Super Hornet has a living wing, that is to say, the shape of the wing is constantly in motion throughout every regime of flight. Trailing edge flaps, leading edge flaps, stabs, rudders, and ailerons all move in concert to give the pilot the greatest control during particular phases of flight.</p>

<p>This is evident by the use of the flaps switch. The three flap positions are, Auto (Up), Half, and Full. Up auto means that the flight control system (FCS) will dynamically change the wing based on what it thinks the pilot is trying to do. However, when the flaps switch is placed in the half and full positions the FCS switches to landing mode, and all flight control inputs will be interpreted as such. Even though the flaps switch has been placed to half/full, the pilot has only changed the FCS logic, he has not actually commanded the flaps to a fixed position. There are no fixed gains (flaps positions) like there are in typical commercial aircraft. Instead, the computer adjusts the flaps position to mimic a flaps half/full position, while also giving the pilot the most stable platform it can for landing. The logic has its limits though and if the pilot exceeds 14 AoA in a landing mode (flaps half or full), the FCS may accidently depart the jet. This is obviously bad 200&nbsp;ft above the ground.  This switch commands the FCS to make flight control decisions and is the toggle between the tactical, and landing modes of flight.</p>

<h2>Rudder Toe-In</h2>

<p>The particular effect you are referencing is called rudder toe-in. At slower speeds, particularly during high angles of attack, the stabilators may not provide sufficient nose authority to crisply rotate the nose. The massive wing area of the Rhino tends to block the airflow over the stabs. To remedy this problem the Rhino's rudders will automatically bias to the inside and create a downward force, which pitches the nose upwards. While the rudder is toed-in, the pilot can still use the rudders to yaw the aircraft. The FCS selectively moves the rudder position to generate the yawing motion, even while retaining the fared-in position.</p>

<p><strong>Take-off and Landing</strong></p>

<p>During takeoff the rudder will remain in the toe-in position for a fixed 10 seconds after it detects weight off the wheels. This prevents the aircraft from accidentally faring the rudders (and losing nose authority) during one of the most critical phases of flight (AoA probe failures will actually cause the rudders to automatically fare, and this problem is removed by a fixed timing.) During the landing portion of flight, the rudders will also be fared in to give the aircraft more nose authority, and this is handled automatically by the FCS once the pilot commands the aircraft into landing mode by placing the flaps switch out of up auto.</p>

<p><strong>Other Functions</strong></p>

<p>While the Rhino does have small speed brakes that extend during full speedbrake deployment, the primary method of increasing drag to rapidly slow the aircraft is through the use of the control surfaces. The FCS will increase the drag by lowering the flaps, toeing-in the rudders, lowing the ailerons, and deflecting the stabs, all while still giving the pilot a stable platform to fly the aircraft--it's an impressive aircraft.</p>

<p>During high alpha maneuvering, the Rhino will again deflect the rudders to the toed-in position while the flaps switch is in up auto. With the FCS logic in auto, the computers will attempt to retain control of the aircraft during max performance maneuvers, and will automatically schedule the flaps and rudders to compensate for high AoA and slow speed flight. Because the nose is cocked up and the airflow is disrupted over the stabs, the rudders will again create that pitching force that will assist the pilot in maintaining nose authority through any regime of flight.</p>

<p><strong>Emergencies</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, there are times when the rudders may suddenly fare themselves which can have devastating effects during the final portion to land. Rudder failures are serious problems and should be treated as such.  Higher landing speeds and extra caution will be used, and the pilot should understand that wave offs may be impossible due to lack of nose authority in close to the ramp.</p>

"How much is airspeed reduced on an A10-Warthog when firing its cannon?","7975","","<p>I just read on reddit that <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7hed07/til_that_the_gun_on_the_a10_warthog_fighter_plane/"" rel=""noreferrer"">you could use the recoil of the gun as the propelling force for the A-10 if pointed backwards</a>. There is also a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/39511/does-the-cannon-of-the-a-10-deliver-more-thrust-than-the-engines-do"">question here on Aviation.SE</a>, saying that the gun has the same power as one single engine.</p>

<p>I'm now wondering how fast airspeed actually decreases when firing the gun.</p>

<ul>
<li>Let's suppose the aircraft is in level flight with no acceleration in any direction. The gun is now being fired. What acceleration is being applied to the aircraft (In m/s or kt/s)?</li>
<li>Bonus question: If there was infinite ammo and nothing like gun overheat, how long would it take to slow the plane down to stall speed, if initial speed was a usual A-10 speed.</li>
</ul>
","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NYdJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NYdJ.png"" alt=""from http://www.fiddlersgreen.net/models/aircraft/Fairchild-Republic-A10.html""></a></p>

<p>Initially, the aircraft flies with constant speed and the engine thrust equals the aerodynamic drag. Then the gun starts to produce negative thrust. The answer would be really easy if all forces stayed the same until the aircraft comes to stall speed, but of course this is not the case. We can't just compute the deceleration at time = 0 and project that into the future: the aircraft slows down because of the recoil thrust, therefore the aerodynamic drag reduces because it is a quadratic function of airspeed. But the propelling thrust is still the same. Deceleration changes constantly as a function of time as well.</p>

<p>It's a complicated situation that can be worked out not with high school physics but with differential equations, in which perhaps only a mathematician will find delight. But it can also be solved with a numerical solution: a real-time computation of the aircraft state. This is what flight simulators do, at every clock tick they update the aircraft state with the latest data. </p>

<p>The method to do this for this question, is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the aircraft data. In simulators used for pilot training, this data is supplied by the manufacturer, or from an actual aircraft rigged out with transducers. In our case, we can deduce the aerodynamic constants that we need from Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Take an initial speed, work out the thrust required for trimmed flight, then at t=0 subtract 50,000 N recoil thrust from the gun. This results in the initial deceleration, say -2.78 m/s$^2$</li>
<li>The next second, t=1, the initial speed has decreased with 2.78 m/s. Compute the new drag at this speed. Thrust is still identical to that at t=0. At the lower drag, we find a lower deceleration value, say -2.66 m/s$^2$</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. Aircraft data</strong> from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerplant: 2 × General Electric TF34-GE-100A turbofans, 9,065 lbf (40.32 kN) each. 80,000 N total.</li>
<li>Maximum speed: 381 knots (439 mph, 706 km/h) at sea level, clean. Equates to 196 m/s.</li>
<li>Weight: Loaded weight: 30,384 lb (13,782 kg) Anti-armor mission weight: 42,071 lb (19,083 kg).</li>
<li>Wing area: 506 ft² (47.0 m²)</li>
<li>Wingspan: 57 ft 6 in (17.53 m). So aspect ratio A = $b^2/S$ = 6.54</li>
</ul>

<p>At maximum speed, level flight, sea level, clean config, 18,000 kg, the aerodynamic lift coefficient $C_L$ and drag coefficient $C_D$ are:</p>

<p>$$C_L = \frac{2\cdot W}{\rho \cdot V^2 \cdot S} = \frac{2\cdot 18,000 \cdot 9.81}{1.225 \cdot 196^2 \cdot 47} = 0.16 \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>$$C_D = \frac{2\cdot T}{\rho \cdot V^2 \cdot S} = \frac{2\cdot 80,000}{1.225 \cdot 196^2 \cdot 47} = 0.072 \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>$$C_D = C_{D_0} + \frac{{C_L}^2}{\pi \cdot A \cdot e} \Rightarrow C_{D_0} = 0.072 - \frac{{0.16}^2}{\pi \cdot 6.54 \cdot 0.8} = 0.07\tag{3}$$</p>

<p><strong>2. Trimmed horizontal flight</strong></p>

<p>We use the aerodynamic constants found under 1. for computing lift, aerodynamic drag and thrust (which equals drag).</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a weight: 18,000 kg, close to an anti-armour mission. </li>
<li>Take a speed: maximum speed = 196 m/s. </li>
<li>Procedure: compute $C_L$ from equation (1), then compute $C_D$ from equation (3), then compute initial drag from D = $C_D \cdot \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 \cdot S$. This is also the engine thrust because the aircraft has constant velocity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Open fire</strong>: the cannon produces 50,000 N reverse thrust</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cpzpw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cpzpw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Image above shows the first 8 seconds, acceleration has decreased from 2.78 to 2.0 m/s$^2$. If we plot velocity over time, we see that speed decelerates to 110 m/s in 165 seconds, stall speed is never reached.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4QLLZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4QLLZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If we repeat the exercise for an initial speed of 160 m/s = 576 km/h = 311 kts, and at the same weight of 18,000 kg, we reach stall speed of 61.11 m/s after 66 seconds, if the pilot keeps the thrust at the same setting. They have plenty time to speed up. The plot also shows what we find if we use the initial acceleration only, a time of 36 seconds.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/931JL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/931JL.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After reaching stall speed it will take a very short time before the aircraft comes to a stop: it falls out of the sky. A shallow dive cures that: gravity now produces a thrust component as well, with $T_G = m \cdot g \cdot sin(\Theta)$. At 18,000 kg, a dive angle of 16° is enough to maintain airspeed without adding thrust while firing the gun: the gravity component now exactly compensates for the thrust of the gun. </p>

You could hover taxi backwards like this to pick up some inflow into the rotors from the relative airflow (and therefore increased lift), then climb away backwards until you do have enough room to transition into normal forward flight, more or less as shown in the video.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a standard enforced by ICAO?</li>
<li>Does every plane manufacturer use the programming language they like as long as it's reliable and it goes through testing?</li>
</ul>

<p>I remember watching a documentary on YouTube last year about aviation and it said something about the EU, after WWII, started making standards for aviation systems inside Europe.
I will link the video if I can find it</p>
","<p>There are no language recommendations or requirements, other than what is sensible given the verification requirements in the various standards (e.g., DO-178B/C). For the highest design assurance levels, the generated code must be inspected down at the op-code level to ensure no known processor gotchas are invoked. You also end up having to test every part of every conditional, both the true and the false sides, and ensure that no jump instructions will take you someplace where you didn't expect it to go.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the big three languages in use in embedded avionics today are:</p>

<ol>
<li>C++ (as a better C. The OO nature is often used only sparingly. Things like polymorphism are just too expensive to verify)</li>
<li>Ada (You may not like it, but a TON of current avionics are written in Ada, and are currently being maintained and updated with new features)</li>
<li>C - As close to the hardware as you want to get and still be highly productive (not intending to offend anyone who is productive in something else)</li>
</ol>

<p>Assembler is frequently used for specific needs, but it would not be used to a greater degree than one of the above-mentioned languages.</p>

<p>What makes these languages ideal for avionics is that they are relatively close to the hardware and memory structure, not too abstract. Their tools are mature and well-known. People have years of experience certifying software written in them. And there are lots of programmers who can get up to speed in them quickly (Yes, even Ada). </p>

<p>Non-safety critical software, both on and off the aircraft, will be written in any of the big languages of the day: Java, C#, VB, C, C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.</p>

  <p>[...] We cannot assume that ATC will assign any special routing or altitude based on the ODP. They expect the pilot to fly the procedure if necessary without further clearance. FAA Order 7110.65R, Air Traffic Control--the controller's handbook--states, ""If a published IFR departure is not included in an ATC clearance, compliance with such a procedure is the pilot's prerogative."" In other words, you have to decide whether you need to follow a specific route or procedure and fly accordingly. Now, we might think this is wrong, dangerous, and dumb, but it is the way procedures are arranged.[...]</p>

<p>According to all this information ATC would expect you to follow this procedure, at least in IMC. If you like to fly it in VMC and it does not disagree with your ATC clearance you are also welcome to do so. If there is any confusion I tend to ask and clarify the situation.</p>

<p>In most cases an ODP says that you should climb on runway heading at least until passing xxx feet before turning in a direction. I would always comply with it and if there is severe CAVOK and ATC then asks me to turn earlier, I would do it, so everyone is happy and on the safe side.</p>

<p>I wonder how does it work compare to a normal rudder and what are the pros and cons of the two-parts rudder over the one-part rudder?</p>
","<p>This is called Split Rudder and it provides redundancy. They run on different systems so if one fails, the other one can be used.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of a split rudder:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Qujo.jpg"" alt=""Split Rudder""></p>

<p>Split rudders also provide a finer high speed control, in that only the lower one moves at high speed, reducing the exposed surface area and therefore the control effect. </p>

<p>Very importantly, there is a structural benefit. When we use the rudder it imposes a twisting load on the vertical fin. By only using the lower rudder, when the aircraft is at high speed, we reduce the twisting moment and transfer that load to a bigger, stronger, part of the airframe. The principle is the same as why the outboard ailerons are disabled at high speed.</p>

<p>Is it possible for a 777 or similar model to hit water without leaving a trace of remains on the surface?</p>
","<p>Yes, but only under highly unlikely circumstances.  An airplane contains all sorts of materials that float, from fuel to seat cushions to the plastic cups in the galley.  In order to sink without leaving any floating wreckage, <em>all</em> of that material would need to be trapped within the airplane while it fills with water.</p>

<p>In order for this to happen, the airplane needs to land intact on the water.  As any number of ditchings indicate, this isn't going to happen -- even US Airways 1549 had the rear of the fuselage tear open on landing.  More often, the engines or wings will tear off, leaving oil and fuel slicks.</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/12216/"">Like Jamiec mentioned</a> the importance of a proper preflight is drilled into you by your primary instructor from day one in light aircraft, and that mentality carries through all the way up to heavy transport-category aircraft: You want to find any problems you can while you're on the ground, because if you take a problem into the air with you it's a decision you can quickly come to regret.</p>

<p>Is there any operational reason for that?</p>
","<p>The ""packs"" (or A/C on the aircraft) are powered by engine bleed air. When bleed air is extracted from the engines, less thrust can be produced. This may be a problem if the airplane is taking off at a high elevation airport or the departure path requires a certain climb gradient to clear obstacles. This action does create some discomfort in the cabin so it's usually not preferred unless required for safety.</p>

<p>Some newer airplanes are manufactured with an ""APU to pack"" configuration - i.e. the pilots leave the APU running during takeoff, which provides bleed air to power the packs. The workload on the engines are now reduced.</p>

"Does an FAA pilot certificate qualify as an ICAO pilot licence?","7891","","<p>What is an ICAO pilot license?</p>

<p>I've seen it as a job requirement before, does my FAA ATP count?</p>
","<p>My understanding is that most FAA licenses would also qualify as ""ICAO Licenses"" (certainly the ATP seems to as we have a bunch of US/FAA certificated ATPs acting as international captains for US airlines flying to/from ICAO member states). From a quick read I think anything from Private up meets the ICAO Annex 1 (personnel licensing) requirements. (It appears that ICAO charges for Annex 1, but <a href=""http://www.cad.gov.rs/docs/atm/ICAO%20Annex%201.pdf"">the fine folks in the Republic of Serbia have made the 2011 edition available on their Civil Aviation Directorate's website</a> for us to all read and enjoy).</p>

<hr>

<p>In addition to the Annex 1 requirements, <a href=""http://www.icao.int/safety/AirNavigation/Pages/peltrgFAQ.aspx"">ICAO's FAQ</a> has the following to say about licensing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ICAO licence or international licence</strong></p>
  
  <p>ICAO does not issue any licences. Licences issued by ICAO Contracting States on the basis of Standards and Recommended Practices of Annex 1 – Personnel Licensing, are habitually called ICAO licences. This has led many to believe that there is a specific ICAO or international licence. The fact is that there is not one single international licence issued by ICAO or any other organization. States issue their own licences based on national regulations in conformity with Annex 1 specifications and validate licences issued by other Contracting States on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements or the fulfilment of nationally legislated requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>International recognition of flight crew licences</strong></p>
  
  <p>The Convention on International Civil Aviation, often called the Chicago Convention, provides for worldwide recognition of flight crew licences issued by any member State of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provided that:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>the licence meets or exceeds the ICAO licensing Standards of Annex 1 – Personnel Licensing to the Convention on International Civil Aviation; and</li>
  <li>the licence is used on an aircraft which is registered in the State which has issued or validated the licence.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If the licence is to be used on an aircraft which is not registered in the issuing State, the licence holder must obtain a validation of the licence from the State of Registry or alternatively obtain a new licence issued by the State of Registry. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically your US/FAA license is a valid ""ICAO License"" as long as you're flying a US-registered aircraft &amp; the nation you're flying to/through accepts US/FAA licenses (possibly with some additional requirements on a per-country basis).</p>

<p>If you got a job for a Serbian airline and needed to fly an aircraft registered in Serbia you would need the Serbian Civil Aviation Directorate to issue you a license (or validate your FAA license) because they are the state of registry. </p>

<p>From what I've read you can get a private license issued pretty easily in most ICAO member states - the procedures are roughly analogous to <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.2.2.1.10"">US FAR 61.75</a> - but if you want anything more than that there are other hoops to jump through to ""convert"" your license, which can range from just a written exam to a full-fledged checkride or more -- this is probably what people are referring to when they say it's difficult to get an ""ICAO License"" issued.</p>

"Why do airports have to close in bad weather?","7887","","<ul>
<li>Shouldn't aircraft be able to withstand winds of up to 100 mph? When flying the wind is at a much higher speed than that.</li>
<li>Shouldn't they be able to take-off through fog using instruments alone?</li>
<li>Shouldn't they be able to take-off on a slippery runway, since the wheels are not powered.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Adding to what the others have mentioned, bad weather is often a combination of low visibility, low ceilings, precipitation, high winds and lightning.</p>

<h3>Visibility and ceilings</h3>

<p>As mentioned in @fooot's answer, ILS is available to land when in these conditions.  Every airliner and crew (and just about every airport they'd go into) is trained and equipped for ILS operations.  A standard ILS approach is good in weather down to 200 ft ceilings and 1800 or 2400 ft visibility along the runway (RVR).  Further airplane and airport equipment and aircrew training can allow ILS category II and III operations, which reduce these numbers (cat II is 100 ft vertical visibility and RVR 1200, cat III goes down to essentially no visibility).</p>

<p>To takeoff, a 2 engined airliner needs 5000 ft RVR (1 mile vis) normally.  Airport lighting and airline opspecs can reduce this as low as RVR 300.</p>

<h3>Wind</h3>

<p>High winds are fine, but can make the landing more challenging.  When the winds are strong and particularly gusty, a lower flap setting can be used to land and a faster approach speed flown.  This will, however, necessitate a long landing rollout.  Exceptional crosswinds can also present problems aligning the aircraft with the runway, and if you can't line up, you can't land (note that some larger airplanes can land in a crab and do not need to align with the runway until the main gear are on the ground).</p>

<h3>Runway condition</h3>

<p>You mention the wheels are not powered, and this is true.  However, the friction between the runway and the contact patch on the tire is the only thing keeping the airplane on the runway in strong crosswinds, so you need friction to land (or takeoff) if there is a crosswind component.</p>

<p>Anything reducing friction is problematic (rain, snow, ice, rubber, etc),  With high water you risk hydroplaning and this (or snow/ice) can lead to departures from the runway sides or an overrun if braking action is insufficient due to lack of friction.  Ice needs to be chemically treated and snow must either be treated or plowed at regular intervals (while it is snowing). Ground handlers at the airport must also have deice fluid and the equipment to apply it to aircraft available for operations in snow.</p>

<h3>Lightning</h3>

<p>When lightning is in the vicinity, ground crews go inside as it is a deadly hazard to be on the ramp in those conditions.  </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>All of these things contribute to lowered arrival rates into the airport and as conditions deteriorate you reach a point where you are spending more time dealing with keeping the airport open than departing airplanes and it makes sense to close the airport temporarily.</p>

"Why is jet fuel cheaper than piston fuel?","7865","","<p>Why is Jet-A cheaper than 100LL? Shouldn't it be the other way around?</p>
","<p>There are a number of factors that go into it:</p>

<h3><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Economies of Scale</a></h3>

<p>Jet-A is used in a much higher volume than 100LL. All the jet engine commercial aircraft each day burn through orders of magnitude more Jet-A than piston aircraft burn through 100LL. That means that there is a much higher production volume, and therefore a cost savings as a result.</p>

<h3>Buying in volume</h3>

<p>It is pretty rare for a jet to taxi up and take on 50 gallons of Jet-A. Even the smaller jets rarely take on less than a couple hundred gallons. If you went up to your local FBO and said that you wanted 500 gallons of 100LL, they would find a way to get a discount for you.</p>

<h3>100LL is special</h3>

<p>Leaded fuels are not manufactured anymore for any other purpose than 100LL. There is a push in the aviation industry to <a href=""http://aviationweek.com/bca/getting-lead-out-future-avgas"" rel=""noreferrer"">do away with the leaded fuels</a> altogether, but this isn't happening for a while. As a result, it takes a special process to add lead to the fuel, equipment not used for any other purpose. Jet-A on the other hand isn't incredibly different from diesel #1 or kerosene, at least in the way it is processed. </p>

<h3>Negotiated contracts</h3>

<p>Because airlines buy so much fuel, they have negotiated contracts directly with fuel suppliers. These contracts help bring the price down because of competition, and the supplier is running a steady supply of fuel for the airline. </p>

<p>I'm not sure why you would think that 100LL would be cheaper, it's sold in low volume, it is expensive to make, and it is environmentally unfriendly and toxic.</p>

","<p>Unlike passengers in economy who are trying to sleep in sitting position in seat that can be only partially reclined, the pilots sleep lying in a bed. Long range aircraft have a crew rest area.

It was a very dangerous situation since the fuel leaks were very close to the failed, then burning, engine. And to make the matter worse, fuel dumping system was down due to hydraulic failure.</p>

<p>Although the crew managed to shut it down, the engine took considerable amount of time for fire to be extinguished completely.</p>

<p>I wonder in those kind of situations, could adding eventually a ""drop-engine-on-fire"" feature make the situation less dangerous?</p>

<p>You may consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Modern airplanes could fly with one engine out.</p></li>
<li><p>Dropping the engine must be in water to not cause any harm to the people below.</p></li>

<li><p>Even if the main evidence of the investigation (that is, the burning engine) will be lost and maybe never found, I think that saving lives is a bit more important.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong><br>
In response to comments, I think that every feature (even if its seems silly) is subject to pro-con studies. For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_1862#Causes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boing 747 had fuse pins</a>  that are designed to break cleanly in case of excessive loads/vibrations.</p>
","<p>The current position of regulators like the FAA is that dropping things off of airplanes in flight is a <em>bad thing</em>. Dropping extremely large and heavy things like engines would be extremely bad. This poses an unacceptable risk to people and property on the ground (or even in the water). Most aircraft with engine fires do not kill anyone on board, so why risk killing people on the ground?</p>

<p>The preferred method of dealing with engine fires is similar to that of fire protection for buildings; take steps to prevent them, and provide methods for putting them out should they start. We don't go blowing up buildings that are on fire just because it might be quicker than putting it out.</p>

<p>So instead manufacturers are required to provide many features to prevent fires. Areas around the engines are separated into zones by firewalls and seals, required to prevent spread of fire. Any flammable fluid is required to be contained and drained, and separated from ignition sources.</p>

<p>If a fire does start, the engines have fire suppression systems installed. The system has to be tested to show that it provides the required suppression to a fire, and the aircraft generally carries enough suppressing agent for at least 2 uses. Even if this doesn't work, the isolation features built in should prevent the fire from spreading, and possibly allow it to burn itself out of fuel or oxygen. In most cases an aircraft is close enough to an airport to land before this becomes an issue.</p>

<p>These measures have been shown to be adequate. When was the last time someone died because of an engine fire on an airplane? Fires are extremely rare, and fires that can't be dealt with by the existing measures are even more rare.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are many more reasons why dropping engines is a bad idea.</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/24935/1696"">Some designs allow an engine to shear away from the wing in the event of a crash</a>, but this is not designed to work in flight. Aircraft that drop items like weapons in flight require extensive design and testing to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVNPn8ilKM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">make sure that the object will drop away from the aircraft properly</a>. An aircraft in an emergency like an engine fire could be making extreme maneuvers that would make this even more difficult.</p>

<p>Objects like weapons that are designed to be dropped regularly still malfunction. How can you make an engine that's been installed for decades separate reliably? If you are relying on this feature for safety, there will be added cost for designing, installing, and maintaining the system. Those costs could be reduced if you don't rely on the feature as much. But then if the current measures are enough, why accept that extra expense?</p>

<p>Investigators generally take interest in engine fires. If you drop the engine, there goes the best evidence for figuring out how the fire started, and what could have prevented or mitigated it. Something large like an engine would be easier to find than smaller parts, but there is still the risk of loss or damage hindering the investigation. If the problem is bad enough that airplanes are dropping engines, it would be better to fix the problem than address the symptoms.</p>

<p>If you constrain pilots to only dropping an engine over water, this complicates things further. There are already rules about where airliners can dump fuel, but dumping fuel is generally a less stressful situation. The pilots chose to stay in the air and dump fuel, so any emergencies are generally less urgent and they have time and attention for where they could dump fuel. If there's an engine fire that requires jettison of an engine, things are going to be more hectic in the cockpit, and it may not be the best time to be considering where this would be allowed, taking things like trajectory into account. And going back to the cost issue, if this would be limited to only areas over water, you couldn't rely on this option to always be available, so is it worth the cost?</p>

<p>Airliners can fly with an engine shut down, but missing an engine is a different matter altogether. The aircraft is required to be tested and certified in many different conditions with an engine shut down. How can we test this with a missing engine? Do we drop an extremely valuable engine every time we test? Do we just make the flight with one engine, which is still in testing itself? Do we not test, and accept that after going to all the trouble of allowing jettison of an engine, the aircraft may not be controllable in some situations?</p>

","<p>What you see on the SR-71 is an Alpha-Beta probe, with a pitot tube branching off the side of it. The nose cone of the SR-71 (and its variants) were changeable depending on it's loadout</p>

<p>From the A12 Configuration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sharply tapered nose section was pressurized and contained navigational and communications equipment, a
  remote compass transmitter, periscope optics, air inlet computer and angle transducer, and other radio equipment.
  A combination pitot-static and alpha-beta probe was installed at the forward tip to capture airspeed and altitude data.</p>

<p>About the SR-71 versatility</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The SR-71 also served as a testbed for an Optical Air Data System (OADS), a fiber optic device using laser
  technology to replace the pitot tube (airspeed probe) on high-performance aircraft. It used laser light instead of air
  pressure to produce airspeed and attitude reference data such as angle of attack and sideslip normally obtained with
  small tubes and vanes extending into the air stream or from tubes</p>

"How much jurisdiction does the FAA have over military aircraft?","7828","","<p>The FAA controls just about everything about civilian aircraft in US airspace in terms of regulation, certification, flight rules, etc. Do they have any authority over military aircraft beyond requiring military flights to communicate with ATC for safety and designating certain areas as military airspace?</p>

","<p>If they are being operated by the military, not much. Military operations can exempt themselves from the FARs (as a matter of practice they <em>don't</em>: When operating in the US National Airspace System they follow the same operational regulations we do, but as a matter of regulation they're subject to the military's rules for airworthiness, maintenance, etc.).  </p>

<p>Military pilots have a military pilot's license (which can be converted to an FAA license with a little paperwork), and the airworthiness and maintenance standards for active military aircraft are defined and managed by the branch of the service responsible for the aircraft.

"If airplanes can't use reverse thrust in flight, what am I hearing?","7817","","<p>I've flown on a few commercial flights, and on several of them I recall a phase of the flight during descent when the engine seemed to go idle (or at least, the engine noise subsided substantially) and then all of the sudden, the engine got really loud and I could feel the plane slowing down substantially, as in, I felt the same as if I was in a car that was slowing down suddenly.  This seemed to last between 5 and 15 seconds, or possibly slightly longer, and then the engines got more quiet and the noticeable deceleration stopped. </p>

<p>Living under a incoming flight path for a few years I have also noticed many times that a plane will be going overhead by the fact that suddenly the engine will get few loud for about the same amount of time.</p>

<p>This seems to be rather common, and I always assume this was reverse thrust.  But today I am reading two separate questions: ""<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9577/is-it-possible-to-use-reverse-thrust-while-airborne?rq=1"">Is it possible to use reverse thrust while airborne?</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2007/why-cant-most-jets-safely-use-reverse-thrust-while-airborne?rq=1"">Why can't most jets safely use reverse thrust while airborne?</a>"", the answers to both of which seem to imply that using reverse thrust while airborne is very rare.</p>

<p>So what have I experience / heard?  I'm pretty sure it's not an airbrake, because far as I can tell a speed brake is a more passive device that doesn't involve the engine, and it would seem to defeat its purpose to spool up the engine while using it.  I've never been in a seat where I could actually see the back of an engine to tell if a reverser was deployed, but I think at least in some cases the speed brakes were also deployed; from in front of the wing this made it impossible to see the back of the engine.</p>

<p>Update: Everyone is saying speed brakes... how long are these usually deployed for? </p>
","<p>It is normal for engines to spool up during the approach. The initial part of the approach, from cruise level is flown at flight idle power. This is the most efficient way to get down. In the final part of the approach flaps and landing gear add so much drag that the engines need to be well above idle power. </p>

<p>At low speeds required for landing, the wing of the aircraft will not produce enough lift to sustain flight. To compensate for the low speed, flaps are extended. They do not only increase the lift, they also increase the drag. When the flaps are extended, suddenly the drag increases resulting a deceleration. Extending the landing gear has a similar effect.</p>

<p>Normally the flight crew will limit the time that they fly at low speed and high drag. The first couple of degrees of flaps deployment are relatively efficient;they do not add a lot of drag but allow the aircraft to fly slower. When the aircraft is about 7 to 10 nautical miles from the runway, the crew will transition the aircraft to landing configuration for the final approach. Often there is a horizontal segment before the aircraft starts a 3 degree glide path down to the runway. The crew will ensure that enough flaps (drag) is added before they start this final segment, otherwise they have difficulty reducing speed (they usually try to prevent use of speed brakes in that part of the flight). 
Often there is a sequence of flap and gear extension before the final descent segment starts. This causes the aircraft to decelerate from the efficient high speed configuration (flaps 2 or less on the B737) to the landing configuration. At the end of that configuration sequence the aircraft has a lot of drag and is decelerating rapidly towards the final approach speed. To stop the deceleration extra power is commanded which spools up the engines and stops the deceleration. To reduce the spool up time of the engines, the engine control system (FADEC) will give a short burst of power. This what you hear while still decelerating. When the engines are spooled up they start to produce thrust which is the end of your deceleration. </p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OcXqH1E0Jw&amp;t=28m20s"">youtube video</a> shows how it happens. When at 28:20 the aircraft (Boeing 737) is flying horizontally, flaps 2, and is about to start decelerating and descending for landing. Keep a look at the throttle (right bottom corner of the screen) and the airspeed (on the left of the artificial horizon). </p>

<p>It begins at 28:28 when the captain ask for flaps 5, and reduces the throttle in order to reduce to final approach speed. 15 seconds later he asks for gear down and flaps 15. The speed is now reducing rapidly. Starting at 28:50 the throttles are moved forward, until they are reduced again at 29:08. This is the power boost you hear. In 40 seconds the aircraft is transformed from low drag / low thrust to landing configuration. </p>

"Can a mistake of a single air-traffic controller cause a collision between planes?","7803","","<p>I am watching <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad_%28season_2%29"">season 2 episode 13 of Breaking Bad</a> and in the episode it shows that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an air traffic controller, distraught from his daughter's death,
  causes a mid-air collision, resulting in debris and human remains
  raining down onto the Whites' residence, as well as the rest of
  Albuquerque</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is at the very end of the episode and it looks like he has done nothing malicious just forgot to tell something. To me this sounds really surprising that a single human error can cause such damage.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I know that most of the scenes about computers depicted in the movies are complete nonsense. Is this a similar nonsense about aviation or is this really possible?</p>
","<p>I haven't seen the Breaking Bad episode, but in my experience any aviation related scenes in films and series are usually stretching reality beyond the breaking point. </p>

<p>But it is possible that a single mistake can cause an accident. The probability of that happening is extremely remote, though.</p>

<p>Typically there are a number of safety barriers (also called defensive layers) in the system<sup>(1)</sup> that prevent any single mistake from developing into a collision. However, every barrier has a small probability of not catching the problem (e.g. due to it not being perfect or being in state of maintenance / failure) so eventually a crash could result from a single mistake. </p>

<p>This is often called the Swiss Cheese Model (originally from Reason, J. (1990) Human Error. Cambridge: University Press, Cambridge.)</p>

<p><a href=""http://patientsafetyed.duhs.duke.edu/module_e/swiss_cheese.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywPqa.gif"" alt=""Swiss cheese model illustrated"">
</a></p>

<p>When an accident happens, sometimes the phrase ""all the holes in the Swiss cheese lined up"" is heard, and you now know why. </p>

<p>While the first hole might be the mistake of a controller, the other holes may not be mistakes but are certainly rare circumstances and flaws in the system.  Accident investigation focuses on identifying these contributing factors.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cberlingen_mid-air_collision#"" rel=""noreferrer"">&#220;berlingen accident</a> mentioned by Portree Kid, two immediate causes have been identified<sup>(2)</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>The imminent separation infringement was not noticed by ATC in time. The instruction for the TU154M to descend was given at a time when the prescribed separation to the B757-200 could not be ensured any more.</li>
  <li>The TU154M crew followed the ATC instruction to descend and continued to do so even after TCAS advised them to climb. This manoeuvre was performed contrary to the generated TCAS RA.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The first cause can be seen as a mistake by the controller, however that mistake could only happen because of a number of contributing factors (systemic causes):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Management and quality assurance of the air navigation service company did not ensure that during the night all open workstations
  were continuously staffed by controllers.</li>
  <li>Management and quality assurance of the air navigation service company tolerated for years that during times of low traffic flow at night only one controller worked and the other one retired to rest.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the above, the Short Term Conflict Alerting (STCA) system did not display conflicts to the air traffic controller because of maintenance (not listed as a cause in the report, but discussed in the text).</p>

<p>The second cause is not a mistake by the crew of the TU154M, but a latent failure in the way ACAS/TCAS II was introduced. Never did anyone give guidance on what to do if the controller and the TCAS gave conflicting instructions. </p>

<p>In the report this is identified as a systemic cause:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The integration of ACAS/TCAS II into the system aviation was insufficient and did not correspond in all points with the system philosophy. The regulations concerning ACAS/TCAS published by ICAO and as a result the regulations of national aviation authorities, operational and procedural instructions of the TCAS manufacturer and the operators were not standardised, incomplete and partially contradictory.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So while the accident was caused by a single mistake from the controller, there were also many flaws in the system, which all together allowed the mistake to develop into an accident. </p>

<p><sup>(1)</sup> By <em>system</em> I mean the aviation system as a whole, not only the air traffic control (computer) systems.</p>

"Why do aircraft on Flight Radar 24 jump around randomly sometimes?","7795","","<p>I use Flight Radar 24 on my iPad to track friends/families flights when they are traveling (not paranoia, just curious).  I've noticed that, quite often, their plane will jump from one location to another, or jump backwards down the flight path, or zoom forward, or any other number of motions that I assume the plane isn't actually making.  (My personal favorite being when they miss the runway on touchdown and the plane disappears.  If that actually happened as often as Flight Radar 24 made it look like it was happening...)</p>

<p>What makes the planes do this on Flight Radar 24?  Why can't it just track the planes correctly?</p>
","<p>FR24 relies for most of the tracks on ADS-B data. Part of the ADS-B transmissions is the position. There are three causes of the behaviour that you observe:</p>

<p>1). Aircraft landing next to the runway</p>

<p>The position source onboard the aircraft is not always GPS. Mainly older aircraft (e.g. Fokker 100) have their Inertial Navigation System (INS) coupled to the ADS-B transmitter. The INS relies not on external radio measurements but only on measured acceleration and rotation to track its position. It is usually correct at take-off, but it develops biases over time and therefore the landing appears quite often next to the runway. I can assure you that this is mostly misleading.</p>

<p>2). Short time track offset</p>

<p>In most aircraft the ADS-B position is from GPS. When the GPS loses its  position fix, the system falls back to INS. As described above, the INS position is slowing drifting from the truth during the flight, so the ADS-B track will shortly jump aside to the INS position until the GPS comes back. When short (e.g. 1 position update) the offsets appear as spikes.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFnFY.jpg"" alt=""INS jump""></p>

<p>3). Long distance jumps (180 NM, 360 NM) </p>

<p>Due to the limited number of bits available in the ADS-B messages, position is encoded in a complex format called Compact Position Reporting. It requires at least two position messages to decode the first position of a track, from that point onward, every message will constitute a position update. When no proper verification algorithms are used in the software, it may occur that a receiver station initializes the track wrongly, usually causing a jump of 180 or 360 NM. </p>

<p>Also note: When INS is used a the position source, the ADS-B data contains an indication that the data is not to be trusted, but that is silently ignored by FR24.</p>

"What are design or functional differences between sticks and yokes?","7766","","<p>I've been flying Cessna 172 &amp; 182's my whole flying life up to this point.  I know that Cirruses (Cirri?) have a ""side yoke"" and Diamonds, Citabrias and others have control sticks coming up through the seat.</p>

<p>Is this a design difference or are there actual functional differences between airplanes that have control yokes (like Cessna 182's) or sticks (like Diamonds) or side yokes (like Cirrus)?</p>

<p>For example, I realize that with the side yoke offers more legroom perhaps, but are there reasons beyond that - like pull/push force required?</p>
","<p>There is some link between the type of control and the design maneuverability of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Consider a yoke.  Imagine twisting it to bank.  You are moving it with a twisting motion of one or both arms and in general, aircraft fitted with such yokes are capable of low to moderate roll rates.  Big displacements are uncommon but small, rapid, alternating changes are common.  Watch a wide body PF making control movements during a landing with any kind of xwind or turbulence.  They are less sensitive and give more visual feedback as to the control positions.</p>

<p>Now consider a stick, central to the pilot flying.  This is moved with a movement of the arm, generally only one, and can be rapidly displaced easily.  This is normally associated with aircraft with high rates of roll, especially in an aircraft designed to rapidly null out or reverse the roll.   It is also physically easier to move a stick than a yoke under high-G as the arm movement gives a longer lever.</p>

<p>A great example of this was the Vulcan which, despite it's size, enormous wing area and large fin, was so rollable that it could out-maneuver the interceptors of it's day.  It has a control column rather than a yoke and the PF would throw it around at altitude as if it were a fighter.  This would not be easy to do with a yoke.</p>

<p>I'm a bit long in the tooth and haven't flown fixed wing for many years.  I am not familiar with the rationale behind side sticks which are fitted to both low and high performance aircraft.  I am guessing they are fitted more for reasons of ergonomics than for performance.</p>

"In a 747 is it normal for the Vr (takeoff speed) to vary greatly depending on fuel load and ambient temperature?","7757","","<p>I was reading one of the documents linked on <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/12665/could-fly-by-wire-protect-against-a-takeoff-tail-strike"">this question</a>, particularly I was reading case study number 8 of <a href=""http://www.ukfsc.co.uk/files/Safety%20Briefings%20_%20Presentations/Acc%20-%20Incident%20-%20IATA%20Flight%20Crew%20Computer%20Errors%20Case%20Studies%20Oct%202011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this particular document</a>.</p>

<p>In the conclusion the author notes that the aircraft flight characteristic calculations had been messed up to the point that all V-speeds were calculated for a 747 100 tons lighter than their actual Take Off Weight (TOW).  Thus, they tried to rotate too early, couldn't get enough lift and the tail of the 747 struck the ground.</p>

<p>When reading that brief description, I had assumed that perhaps they were off by 5 to 8 knots, or something along those lines.  So, I was surprised to see the author later note that V<sub>r</sub> was actually off by close to 30 knots!</p>

<p>I'm really curious suddenly, how much can a 747's rotation speed change?  I was told that rotation speed was generally somewhere around 130 knots for that class of plane, but if there is a 30 knot variance. Can it really be anywhere from 115 to 145 depending on the weight of the plane?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/12677/1696"">As Henning Makholm's answer discusses</a>, the weight difference between the lowest and highest weights is significant. The operating empty weight (OEW) of a 747-400 is 394,100 lb, while the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 875,000 lb. This means there is a difference of about 400,000 lb between the lightest and heaviest weights at which a 747 may be taking off, making the MTOW about twice as heavy as the OEW.</p>

<p>The rotation speed Vr is the point at which the aircraft can pitch up and develop enough lift to climb. So at MTOW, the 747 must develop about twice as much lift than closer to OEW. Most of this force is lift from the wings.</p>

<p>Lift can be calculated with the <a href=""http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/WindTunnel/Activities/lift_formula.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">following equation</a>:</p>

<p>L = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>ρv<sup>2</sup>sC<sub>L</sub></p>

<p>L = lift<br>
ρ = air density<br>
v = airspeed<br>
s = wing area<br>
C<sub>L</sub> = lift coefficient</p>

<p>The air density will certainly play a role. Higher altitudes and temperatures reduce the amount of lift. But this example pertains to the other variables.</p>

<p>An airliner can use flaps and slats to increase the <em>C<sub>L</sub></em> and <em>s</em> of its wings.</p>

<p>The <em>C<sub>L</sub></em> will also depend on the angle of attack <em>α</em> of the wings. An approximate curve for the 747 can be seen <a href=""http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/aerodynamics/q0252.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (it's for a 747-200, but it should be close enough). When an aircraft rotates, it is changing the AOA, which increases the lift. It is very important when designing an aircraft to make sure it can pitch up enough while on the runway to achieve the pitch angle needed for takeoff. A 747-400 rotates to about <a href=""http://www.bangaloreaviation.com/2009/05/typical-takeoff-and-climb-angles-of-all.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10 degrees</a> on takeoff. Based on the approximate <em>C<sub>L</sub></em>-<em>α</em> diagram, the lift coefficient changes from about 0.3 to 1.25 when <em>α</em> changes from 0 to 10 on rotation.</p>

<p>When the aircraft weight is increased, flaps may be increased from <a href=""http://www.bangaloreaviation.com/2009/05/typical-takeoff-and-climb-angles-of-all.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10 to 20</a>. However, flaps 20 may be standard because <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/114159/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these guys said so</a>, so lets assume that <em>C<sub>L</sub></em> and <em>s</em> will also not change. This leaves the airspeed <em>v</em> as the only parameter left to increase lift.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar04-44.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In this study</a>, figure A-7 shows a distribution of ground speed at liftoff that lies between 140 and 190 kts. These numbers will probably be a little higher than V<sub>r</sub> due to the acceleration between V<sub>r</sub> and liftoff, and an average headwind. This means that at weights at the lowest end, 130 kts would be a reasonable estimate for V<sub>r</sub>. </p>

<p>So now lets make up some numbers. Lets take the weights 475,000 lb and 875,000 lb. Assume that the aircraft needs a lift 10% higher than its weight to take off. This gives us lift values of 522,500 lb and 962,500 lb. Using the lift equation and a low end speed of 130 kts to find the unknown portion.</p>

<p>522500 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>ρ130<sup>2</sup>sC<sub>L</sub></p>

<p>ρsC<sub>L</sub> = 61.8</p>

<p>Since we are assuming none of those vales will change, we can solve for <em>v</em> at the higher lift value.</p>

<p>962500 = <sup>61.8</sup>/<sub>2</sub>v<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>v = 176 kts</p>

<p>This is not too much lower than the high end liftoff value of 190 kts. So there you have it. Lift must be increased to account for the additional weight, and lift is proportional to the square of the airspeed.</p>

"How dissimilar are redundant flight control computers?","7756","","<p>On Airbus aircraft there are computers to secure the flight envelope, or to move the control surfaces.

  <p>Can a sextant be used while flying?</p>

<p>Yes it can. Some aircraft like 747 for example had a sextant port to allow celestial navigation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How accurate/reliable is a sextant, both standing still and at 500+ mph?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sextant is not accurate. At least not accurate enough for today's navigation purposes. You cannot perform a RNP-RNAV approach with a sextant. Per wikipedia, the best accuracy you can get with a sextant is between a tenth to a quarter of nautical mile. But it is a very good alternative if everything else fails.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are sextants found in any cockpits today?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for sextants in modern cockpits, my best guess is you won't find any, at least in the form of one ""left in a drawer"". See that image of a sextant being operated on a VC-10. It's more like a submarine periscope than a traditional naval sextant.</p>

<p>Link to related benchmarks appreciated.</p>
","<p>I cannot answer all your questions, but maybe point you to some facts to come closer to an answer.</p>

<p>Most important is the thickness of your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parallelepiped</a> - more than a few percent will just increase drag, without benefiting performance. It should be as thin as structurally possible. There are lots of model airplanes using flat plates for lift. The most popular are flying discs like that below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsvQT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsvQT.jpg"" alt=""Flying disc with witch-on-broom motive being launched""></a></p>

<p>(picture <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

<h2>Lift</h2>

<p>The lift curve slope of a flat plate is the same as that of regular airfoils, complete with stall. They have a zero-lift angle of attack of 0° (obviously) and separated flow on the suction side. The maximum lift coefficient of 0.7 to 0.8 is reached at moderate angles of attack - <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14508/calculating-a-finite-wings-lift-from-its-sectional-airfoil-shape/14559#14559"">details depend on the aspect ratio</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfc8F.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfc8F.png"" alt=""lift curve slope comparison""></a></p>

<p>Your typical four-digit NACA airfoil will have a maximum lift coefficient of 1.2 to 1.6, depending on camber and Reynolds number (picture <a href=""http://www.boundvortex.com/images/flat_plate.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>).</p>

<h2>Drag</h2>

<p>Due to the missing nose thrust, the aerodynamic force vector will stand almost perpendicular to the plate's plane. It will be slanted slightly backwards due to friction, but the separated flow on the suction side means that friction will mostly happen on the pressure side. As a rough approximation, the drag coefficient of the flat plate is $$ c_D = c_L \cdot \sin\alpha + \frac{0.43}{log\left(\frac{100}{R}\right)^{2.56}} + 0.3 \cdot\delta\cdot\cos\alpha$$
with $R$ the relative surface roughness, $\delta$ the relative thickness and $\alpha$ the angle of attack. The first part is caused by the direction of the lift vector, the second part is the friction contribution and will be dwarfed by the pressure part, and the third part is an approximation for the suction along the thick trailing edge. At $\alpha$ = 5° and a lift coefficient of 0.5, the drag coefficient will already be around 0.05.</p>

<p>Regular NACA airfoils will have a $c_{D0}$ of 0.004 to 0.01, depending on Reynolds number, and their $c_D$ at stall is normally between 0.02 and 0.025.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>From the above it is fair to assume that drag in cruise condition will easily be 4 times higher (induced drag is not affected), and the optimum cruise condition will be at a lower speed due to the higher zero-lift drag. On top, the airplane will need a bigger engine to stay airborne, which will reduce its useful load. Expect fuel consumption to increase in line with the drag increase.</p>

<p>The stall speed of an aircraft with a flat plate wing will be approx. 50% higher than with a proper airfoil on the wing, and drag will increase much more at high lift coefficients than usual, which translates into very low sustained turn rates and load factors.</p>

<p>Only the angle of attack range will stay similar. All other parameters will be markedly affected.</p>

","<p>It is very common for planes to land on snow (i.e. <em>packed</em> snow) or even ice runways.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How are planes kept in control with so less friction on ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Snow/ice friction is a function of the outside air temperature, so it depends. Another factor is whether the runway was packed, fresh snow - and the temperature the previous day. The colder it is, the more friction the snow will have (i.e. adequate braking). In warmer temperatures the snow will be slick (scarily slick at times - as in nil braking).</p>

<p>While flying a multi-engine airplane, one can use differential power. If you're flying a single-engine airplane - one is better off with small taps on the brake during slick conditions. If the OAT is relatively cold (well below freezing), braking can be pretty good.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the procedure to perform such kind of landing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The procedure is the same as a standard landing. However, it is awfully nice to have good contrast on the snow to see the runway. Often runways that are pure snow/ice will be more visible than the surrounding terrain. At the very least - the runway will be outlined with some sort of runway markers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, on an average how much extra distance does an aircraft 
  covers by landing on snow, as compared to landing on ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, it is really dependent upon the outside air temperature and the condition of the runway (i.e. packed snow or fresh snow).</p>

<p>For example, suppose there were fresh snow on a relatively warm day (30 degrees farenheight) and the snow is compacted (i.e. by humans) that day. Say, night-time temperatues drop to 0F, and the next day you land with an OAT of 30 to 35+F... that runway is going to be SLICK. However, if the temperatures were to stay at 0F - you would actually have decent braking. Even further, if the OAT dropped to -40 below...you will have excellent braking.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: </p>

<p>Snow conditions are always changing and braking/control of the airplane are dependent on those conditions. Snow-conditions are highly dependent on the outside air temperature and to some degree human-maintenance (for better or worse).</p>

<p>Also, if seaplanes needs to go into some marsh, will that work for them?</p>
","<p>A pure seaplane cannot land on a normal (land) airfield: The hull or floats would be badly damaged.</p>

<p>An <em>amphibious</em> aircraft can land on both water or a normal airfield (pavement, grass, gravel, etc.), because it has both wheels and floats, but with amphibious aircraft you're either operating as a seaplane (on water) or a landplane (on solid ground), and you would follow procedures appropriate to the type of operation you're conducting.</p>

<hr>

<p>As I understand it amphibious aircraft would not be suited to landing in a ""marsh"" or ""swamp"": The water and mud would render the wheels ineffective (and possibly dangerous: If the wheels dig in to the mud the aircraft could flip over), and the dirt/land portions of the area would damage or destroy the floats/hull.<br>

"What is a stabilized approach?","7678","","<p>Most (all?) airlines require the use of a <em>stabilized approach</em>, and it is constantly referred to as a safer way to land an airplane.  </p>

<p>What are the criteria for an approach to be considered stabilized?</p>

<p>What makes it safer than a ""normal"" (unstabilized?) approach?</p>
","<p>When you look at FAA publications <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/news/safety_briefing/2013/media/se_topic_june_2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the criteria for a ""stabilized approach""</a> is pretty simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A stabilized approach is one in which the pilot establishes and maintains a constant angle glidepath towards a predetermined point on the landing runway.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>When pilots talk about stabilized approaches we generally mean a little more than that though - for example <a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Stabilised_Approach"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the SKYbrary description of a stabilized approach</a>, <a href=""http://flightsafety.org/files/alar_bn7-1stablizedappr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Flight Safety Foundation</a>, and <a href=""http://www.airbus.com/fileadmin/media_gallery/files/safety_library_items/AirbusSafetyLib_-FLT_OPS-APPR-SEQ01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Airbus</a> all include more than just the constant-angle glide path in their recommendations for what makes an approach ""stabilized"".</p>

<p>Criteria that are commonly included in a ""stabilized approach"" are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintaining a constant-angle glidepath toward a predetermined aiming point on the runway.</li>
<li>Maintaining a specified descent rate</li>
<li>Maintaining a specified airspeed (V<sub>app</sub>)<br>
(Generally being <em>slightly</em> above V<sub>app</sub> is OK, but below is unacceptable.)</li>
<li>Having the aircraft configured for landing (gear, flaps, etc.)</li>
<li>All required checklists completed</li>
<li>The approach can be maintained with only ""small corrections"" to pitch, heading, or power.</li>
</ul>

<p>An approach is ""stabilized"" if all the required criteria are met by a specific altitude (Airbus calls them ""Stabilization Heights"", and recommends 500 feet for approaches in VMC, and 1000 feet for approaches in IMC).<br>
If the approach is not stabilized by the appropriate stabilization height (or conditions cause the approach to become ""destabilized"" - a sudden change in winds for example) the approach is abandoned (a ""go-around"").</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So what makes stabilized approaches safer?</strong><br>
The theory is that a stabilized approach reduces the pilot's workload as they're getting closer to the ground: If the aircraft is configured for landing and all the checklists have been completed all the pilot has to do is gently nudge the controls to keep the plane going where they want it, and they can concentrate all of their attention on a nice, safe, (hopefully) smooth landing.</p>

<p><strong>Are stabilized approaches always safer?</strong><br>
From a workload perspective, yes. It's hard to argue with ""The pilot has less work to do"".<br>
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1259/why-is-dragging-it-in-considered-bad-in-small-aircraft-but-fine-in-larger-air"">From a ""What if my one-and-only engine dies?"" perspective, maybe not.</a>  </p>

<p>Stabilized approaches generally require partial power to be maintained throughout the approach, and although the engines in modern single-engine piston/jet aircraft have a pretty good track record of reliability there are good arguments for ""non-stabilized"" approaches (or approaches that are effectively ""stabilized"" at idle power) in single-engine aircraft.  </p>

<p>Even if you're <em>not</em> flying a ""stabilized approach"" the way the airline folks define it you're well-served by incorporating some of the elements though - going around if your checklists aren't completed by a certain altitude, abandoning the approach if you have to manhandle the controls to try to keep things together, etc.</p>

Can a pilot take off at his own discretion?</p>

<p>To summarize the link: a pilot is begging the tower to be allowed to depart and repeatedly denied due to what the controller describes as a ""military operation"" or ""people in the tower"". The pilot indicates the situation is dangerous and even reports seeing gunfire on the ground at one point. The pilot then repeatedly asks for permission to depart ""at my own discretion"". In the end, it appears that he does not depart.</p>

<p>Would there be any consequences for the pilot? Is he allowed to take off if the situation on the ground is more threatening than in the air? Are there any international regulations in this case?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking a pilot <em>can</em> (physically) do whatever they want: ATC doesn't have a remote control. If you push the throttles forward and pull back on the yoke you will take off, no matter what mean things the folks in the tower are shouting at you over the radio.</p>

<p>Practically speaking doing so can get you into trouble: You may be met in the air by planes with more guns than yours, or projectiles from the ground may be fired in such a way as to intersect your flight path (""You might get intercepted or shot down by very annoyed military types."") -- even if that doesn't happen you may face administrative or civil action for ignoring ATC instructions in the jurisdiction where you did this. </p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not sure what the ATC policies are in Turkey, but the US FAA has a phrase specifically for this: <code>UNABLE TO ISSUE DEPARTURE CLEARANCE. DEPARTURE WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</code> (you'll find it in <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/ATC.pdf"">JO 7110.65W, on page 3-3-1</a>). </p>

<p>The emergency authority of a pilot is also recognized worldwide (at least in ICAO states - you'll find it in Annex 2, 2.3.1, conveniently quoted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_in_command"">on Wikipedia</a>), so if the pilot in command deems that remaining on the ground constitutes an emergency they can violate regulations to the extent necessary to meet the emergency (i.e. forego getting a clearance and take off even if ATC is saying not to).</p>

"Why are pilots asked to provide a reason for a go-around?","7652","","<p>Why does the tower ask pilots what the reason is for a go-around? This seems to be standard for commercial flights.</p>
","<p>Pilots are not required to give a reason for a go-around, just to say that they are going around. A go-around is a busy time for the pilot(s) of the aircraft - power, flaps, trim, must be set, gear raised in some cases. The pilot needs to aviate first. </p>

<p>The tower wants to know why the go-around was initiated by the pilot as it may be relevant for safety and/or operations. If the pilot is going around because of a botched approach then that won't impact other flights, however if there is a problem with the aircraft the tower can organize emergency resources. If the go-around is due to a situation on the ground then the tower can look to clear that up.  </p>

"Why is full carb heat recommended when reducing power below normal setting?","7642","","<p>In my first flight lesson today, my instructor asked me to apply full carburetor heat when we had to reduce power to 1900 RPM in our Cessna 152.</p>

<p>I was surprised by this as I didn't remember learning this in ground school, and I later checked the Jeppesen textbook I am using, and referring to the section on carburetor icing, I saw that when power is reduced below normal operating limits, full carb heat is recommended (must have missed it when studying the ground material).</p>

<p>My understanding is that the cause of carb icing is the sudden drop in temperature in the venturi due to drop in pressure as the fuel speeds up. If I am reducing power, I am reducing fuel flow, so shouldn't this reduce the chances of icing? So my question is why is full carb heat recommended when decreasing power below normal operation?</p>
","<p>At full throttle, manifold pressure is high, close to ambient pressure at that altitude.  At partial throttle or at idle, manifold pressure is low.  It is the transition from higher pressure (ambient) to low pressure (in the induction manifold) that causes cooling.  Think of why ambient temperature is cooler at 10,000 feet MSL than it is at 1,000 MSL.  So moving the throttle to a lower power position will cool the carburetor.  </p>

<p>The advice is right, follow the instructions in the POH.  </p>

"Can a few random interaction with cockpit controls result in a crash?","7639","","<p>Lets say a monkey / snake interacts with 3 random controls inside the cockpit within less than 3 seconds until the PIC / SIC can take control of the aircraft again.

<ul>
<li>small commercial aircraft (e.g. A319, CRJ900)</li>
<li>short distance flight (e.g. LEJ -> FRA)</li>
<li>appropriate cruising altitude for this distance</li>

<li>This question is aiming at quick interactions with controls, no prolonged input.</li>
<li>Assume the pilots make no errors after the incident.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Background:<br>
I was recently telling a post-9/11 flyer that I was generally allowed to visit the cockpit during the flight (as a child, pre-2000s). That person was surprised that this was allowed and asked what would've happened if a kid managed to interact with the cockpit.<br>
Neglecting the fact that the pilots would probably intervene before any controls were touched it got me thinking if it would even be possible to doom a plane with a few quick interactions.</p>
","<p>Random? Probably not. Deliberate? It's hard to say, but the pilots will certainly have a hard time landing.</p>

<p>There are many switches in a cockpit, and some are more important than others. If you don't know what you're touching, chances are you're manipulating a control that is not so important, for example the brightness of the LCD display panel, or the frequency of the VHF radio.</p>

<p>If you know which circuit breaker or engine control switch to hit however, you can attempt to deliberately sabotage. Such important controls are usually protected by a plastic cover to avoid accidental activation, because once it is activated, there is no turning back. To push one of these switches, the usual cockpit procedure is for one pilot to place his hand on the switch, then wait for the other pilot to say ""confirm"" to make sure there is no mistake.</p>

<p>See for example, the overhead panel of a 747:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a7A1R.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a7A1R.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If let's say, you manage to very quickly turn off all IRS, or disengage the electricity generator of every engine (which cannot be re-engaged without mechanical maintenance), you can wreak havoc in the cockpit. If the pilots handle the emergency well, they can land safely - but not in a easy way at least.</p>

"On the F15-E, can the WSO take over if the pilot is incapacitated?","7628","","<p>The F15-E Strike Eagle features a two-man cockpit. The pilot in the front seat and the WSO (Weapons System Officer) in the back seat.</p>

","<p>Short answer, yes.  However, it is important to note that the WSO is not a pilot.  The WSO is trained to operate the weapons systems, not fly the aircraft, but does have basic flight controls including throttle, stick, rudder pedals, compass, HSI, etc.  He does not have good forward visibility and would likely have to be talked in on final approach by the tower, as his view is obstructed by the pilot's seat.</p>

<p>Although the F-15E was developed from the D-model used for pilot training, the airframe was significantly redesigned for it's new purpose, and the back seat of an E-model bears only a passing resemblance to the back seat of a D-model.  The WSO has a very specific and complex set of tasks which does not include flying the airplane, and his controls are designed around that purpose.  He has more screens than the pilot to look at, and two side-stick controllers (not part of the flight control system) that are used for controlling / selecting / guiding / programming / etc. a large variety of weapons. He also has primary control over the FLIR and laser pods used for target designation and tracking.</p>

<p>On a final note, it is not uncommon (although less common in these days of sequestration) for non-aircrew personnel to be given 'incentive rides' in the back seat of aircraft like the F-15D/E or F-16D, and during these rides control of the aircraft is invariably passed to the passenger.  I was privileged enough during my Air Force career to get a ride in the back seat of an F-15E (tail number 88-1671 at Seymour Johnson AFB, NC) and can say from personal experience that it is possible to fly an F-15E from the back seat.  It was the most exhilarating 5 minutes of my life.  Fortunately for both of us, the pilot didn't experience any problems during the flight...</p>

"Why are updraft carburetors standard in aviation?","7603","","<p>My only detailed experience with carburetors is in aircraft. I'm pretty familiar with the principles behind float-type carbs, but I recently saw a schematic for a ""downdraft carburetor"" with a choke valve. This got me curious, so I did a little research and found that what I'm used to is an ""updraft carburetor"", and that (according to wikipedia) they <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carburetor#Principles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fell out of fashion</a> in the automotive industry in the <strong>1930s</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the updraft carburetor design so prevalent in aviation?</strong> Does an updraft carb actually have a choke valve?</p>

","<p>I can think of three reasons to use an updraft carburetor in a single-engine GA airplane:</p>

<p>Anti-flooding:</p>

<p>The float-bowl regulator in your carburetor is cheap and simple, but it is far from perfect under all conditions.  Short periods of zero-G or negative-G operation, caused by a quick dive, turbulence, or even bumping over uneven ground, can jiggle the float and spill liquid fuel into the venturi.  </p>

<p>In a downdraft or sidedraft carburetor, this liquid falls into the intake manifold and wets the interior walls and may get into the cylinders, causing an over-rich mixture condition.  The engine is said to be ""flooded"" and will not run until the liquid is cleared out.</p>

<p>With an updraft carburetor, the spilled fuel tends to fall out before it can foul anything.</p>

<p>Gravity feed:</p>

<p>If your aircraft has fuel tanks higher than the carburetor when in cruise attitude, you may be able to remain under power if your fuel pump fails.  An updraft carburetor can be mounted lower in the engine compartment than sidedraft or downdraft types; in fact, it is usually under the engine.</p>

<p>Early automobiles did this to avoid the need for a fuel pump; fuel was fed by gravity from a fuel tank higher than the carburetor, e.g. just below the windshield.  The lower the position of the carburetor, the deeper the fuel tank could be.</p>

<p>Convenience:</p>

<p>If you look inside the cowling of most GA planes, you will see much more space under the engine block than above it.  That seems to be the best place for lots of auxiliary equipment and attachments, including the carburetor and air filter.</p>

<p>Is there a reason for this, or is it just coincidence? I thought it might be that helicopters are just long enough for the tail rotor to not interfere with the main rotor, but that doesn't seem to work out, because the rotors aren't quite centered over the helicopter.</p>

","<p><strong>Important</strong>.  I am a helicopter pilot, with no expertise or experience in design so I can give you <strong>reasons</strong> for this, but not design detail.</p>

<p>Most design decisions are compromises.  Helicopter rotors are definitely compromises.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the aim of the rotor design?</em></strong>
To have the smallest possible rotor to achieve the performance requirements of the craft.</p>

<p><strong><em>What limits the smallest size?</em></strong>
Let's assume that the blades are as efficient at generating lift as you can make them.  There are only 2 ways to increase lift for any given blade at any given angle of attack.  That is to increase the length of the blade or to move it faster through the air, i.e. to make the rotor spin faster.</p>

<p><strong><em>What limits the speed at which the rotor can rotate?</em></strong>
As the blade tip speed gets faster, drag increases with the square of the speed.  Increased drag means increased power required which means heavier engine and heavier gearbox.  As speed moves to a high percentage of supersonic, turbulence and therefore drag increases enormously.  The longer the blade, the lower the possible rotor RPM since the tip approaches supersonic speed more quickly.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why not just increase the length?</em></strong>
Because the blade becomes increasingly difficult (and expensive) to manufacture to handle the loads on the blade and the heavier they become requiring more robust and heavier rotors hub assemblies.  </p>

<p>The inner part of the rotor also produces little lift since it is moving relatively slowly and since lift decreases with the square of the speed, the lift generated falls away rapidly as you move to the inside portion of the disc.  As you increase the length of the blade, without being able to increase the speed of the disc as above, the area of the disc which is ""useless"", increases as a proportion of the overall disc size.  Therefore, more power is needed to rotate the increasingly large useless area of the disc.</p>

<p><strong><em>The lower the disc loading, the more efficient the helicopter is in the hover</em></strong>.
The disc loading is the ratio of the weight of the helicopter and the area the rotor disc describes as it rotates.  The disc loading should be as low as possible to reduce the required strength, and thus weight, of the blades especially as the weight of the helicopter increases under positive G which in turn increases the disc loading.</p>

<p><strong><em>Non-performance considerations.</em></strong>  Parking; hangar space required; ability to operate in confined areas. </p>

<p>Given these (and other design parameters), the rotor sizes you quote will have been arrived at by factoring each of the variables to find the best compromise, according to the designer, between them to achieve the desired performance goals.</p>

<p>Therefore, I don't believe that there is a relationship between the fuselage length and rotor size, possibly with some influence from the need to park and hangar the resulting craft.</p>

<p>[EDIT]
I've been hoping that some better informed answers would be added.  As there are none, I'll continue with my simple pilot guesswork.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the aim of the fuselage design?</em></strong>
To have the smallest possible fuselage to achieve the performance requirements of the craft.</p>

<p><strong><em>What limits the smallest size?</em></strong>
How many crew?  How many PAX?  Level of comfort (utilitarian - R22, or comfortable - Long Ranger).  Fuel load.  Engine and gearbox size.  Cargo and other payload.  Baggage stowage?</p>

<p><strong><em>What limits the maximum size?</em></strong>
Weight.  Profile drag.  Cost to manufacture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Non-performance considerations.</em></strong>  Parking; hangar space required.</p>

"What is the advantage of combining the rudder and brake pedals in aircraft?","7587","","<p>I've read about several aircraft having their rudder and brake pedals very close together. To me this seems confusing and prone to error. It looks easy to mistake the rudder / brake pedals and inadvertently press the wrong one when flying or taxiing the aircraft. Since these are fundamentally important controls, this could lead to disaster.</p>

<p>So what is the advantage of keeping the rudder / brake pedals in this configuration? Are there any historical reasons for this design choice?</p>
","<p>All of the aircraft that I have ever seen have the rudder and braking functions combined into one set of two pedals.  To operate the rudder you press on the bottom part of the pedals, so that they slide back and forth on tracks, and to operate the brakes, you press the top part of the pedals so that they rotate towards the floor.  The left pedal operates the left wheel brake, and the right pedal operates the right brake, so you can use differential braking to turn the plane.  For rudder operation, the motion of the two pedals is locked together (i.e. press on the right pedal for right rudder, and the left pedal moves aft while the right pedal moves forward).  </p>

<p>Because of the two different motions (rotation for brakes versus sliding for rudder) there isn't a problem with hitting the brakes when you want rudder or vice versa.  Typical early training is to operate the rudder using your toes on the lower parts of the pedals, so and to only put your whole foot on the pedal to actuate the braking mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Because the cavewoman who invented the log-canoe was right-handed?</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: I arrived at this answer by looking at a kind of etymology of the terms starboard &amp; port but that's incidental.

Some groups of aviators may have dropped the archaic terms while still being subject to a continuation of an archaic habit/convention.</em>  </p>

<p>People get on the left side of a jet airplane because Vikings (etc) steered their wooden boats with a steering board (hence starboard?) held in their dominant right-hand.</p>

<p>Since it was inconvenient to have your steering apparatus wedged against a quayside (or earthen bank) they docked at the <strong>port</strong> along their left side and therefore loaded and unloaded on the left.</p>

<p>Excerpt from <a href=""http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/trivia03.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trivia on the Navy website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Port and starboard</strong> Port and starboard are shipboard terms for left and
  right, respectively. Confusing those two could cause a ship wreck. In
  Old England, the starboard was the steering paddle or rudder, and
  ships were always steered from the right side on the back of the
  vessel. Larboard referred to the left side, the side on which the ship
  was loaded. So how did larboard become port? Shouted over the noise of
  the wind and the waves, larboard and starboard sounded too much alike.
  The word port means the opening in the ""left"" side of the ship from
  which cargo was unloaded. Sailors eventually started using the term to
  refer to that side of the ship. Use of the term ""port"" was officially
  adopted by the U.S. Navy by General Order, 18 February 1846.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it's a historical convention, many arbitrary choices are of this sort. Pioneers of a new form of transport adopt the terms (port, startboard) and habits of more ancient forms of transport.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ironically, since aircraft became able to carry substantial non-human cargo, the cargo entry has moved to the other side to reduce the chances of crushing the human cargo with the non-human cargo. Presumably also because having lots of large holes all in one side may be structurally disadvantageous.</p>

","<p>The opening cockpit windows do serve some purpose, like providing an additional means of evacuation during an emergency.* There have been instances where the <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/2000/02/10/stories/03100005.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">crew had used the cockpit windows to escape</a> during hijackings.</p>

<p>There are other purposes like assisting in crew inspection, signaling ground crew, additional ventilation, smoke egress etc (It can also be <a href=""http://www.airstewardess.org/british-airways-ba-2945-pilot-threw-phone-on-runway/"" rel=""noreferrer"">used for throwing things out</a>, though it is not generally recommended). One main reason (atleast in the past) appears to be to improve the pilot visibility in case the windshield becomes opaque, for example.</p>

<p>The windows are not found in all aircraft (for eg. 787 doesn't have it) and are not very easy to open (note that it opens inwards). From <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/getline/2006-01-30-ask-the-captain_x.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">USAToday Ask the Captain</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First there is a locking mechanism, then either a crank which moves the entire window assembly including the frame, or a lever with which to move the window assembly. When the window is closed and locked, it is sealed shut. When open, it does not separate from the frame as the window in your car does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, FAR 25 Section 773- Pilot Compartment View <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/25.773"" rel=""noreferrer"">requires cockpit windows to be openable</a> (or some other means to have clear windshield during precipitation) :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) Precipitation conditions. For precipitation conditions, the following apply:</p>
  
  <p>(1) The airplane must have a means to maintain a clear portion of the windshield, during precipitation conditions, sufficient for both pilots to have a sufficiently extensive view along the flight path in normal flight attitudes of the airplane. </p>
  
  <p>(3) The first pilot must have a window that—</p>
  
  <p>(i) Is openable under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section when the cabin is not pressurized;</p>
  
  <p>(4) The openable window specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section need not be provided if it is shown that an area of the transparent surface will remain clear sufficient for at least one pilot to land the airplane safely in the event of—</p>
  
  <p>(i) Any system failure or combination of failures which is not extremely improbable, in accordance with § 25.1309, under the precipitation conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p>
  
  <p>(ii) An encounter with severe hail, birds, or insects. </p>

<p>In a pressurized cabin, providing windows is not a great idea. (In addition to the increased weight), if anyone manages to open the window, it would be a recipe for disaster (depressurization -> oxygen masks -> land).</p>

"What is the typical aircrew for a cargo flight?","7513","","<p>What is the typical aircrew for a civilian (not military) <strong>cargo</strong> flight? From my limited web searches, it seems that there would be three crew members:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pilot</li>
<li>Co-pilot (I assume there must always be minimum of two people in the flight deck, in case anything happens to the primary pilot)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadmaster"">Loadmaster</a>, a crew member responsible for loading and unloading cargo, and for assuring load balance during the flight.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are these indeed three minimal, required crew members for a cargo flight? Are there any others that are required or optional? What is typical for a long haul cargo flight, and what is typical for short haul. (Rather than precisely defining how many hours is long haul or short haul--I'm not even sure--I'll leave that open for the answerers, since I'm really not sure what to expect.)</p>
","<p>Modern civil cargo flights can be divided into three categories: containerized-load, large-load, and feeder.</p>

<h3>Containerized-load cargo (ULDs, standard pallet loads)</h3>

<p>This is your typical UPS or FedEx flight; their flight crew complements are no different than a passenger aircraft flying the same route -- a captain and F/O for a short haul route such as one of the UPS A300s, and a captain, F/O, relief captain, and relief F/O (""heavy"" crew) for a long-haul flight that needs them, although they may prefer to break such a flight up into segments, performing crew changes on the ground.  (Flight engineers aren't counted here since those aircraft are basically retired now.)</p>

<h3>Bulk-load cargo</h3>

<p>These loads (vehicles, large equipment, live animals, etc) require more attention, so loadmasters are more commonly seen on these flights.  <em>However</em>, the FAA does not consider a loadmaster ""flight crew"" in the sense that there are no licenses or ratings for the position; the training and qualifications for loadmasters are completely up to their employer.</p>

<h3>Feeder aircraft</h3>

<p>Feeder aircraft are often turboprop types (ATRs, for instance) that are too small to use standard-sized ULDs, so they are loaded in bulk on the main deck.  They use a captain and first officer pairing as well.</p>

<p>Either way, most cargo aircraft have room for supernumeraries (aka jump seaters), at least on the cockpit jumpseats if not in a forward or upper deck passenger cabin as well; long-haul aircraft will also have crew rest bunks fitted to that forward cabin area for use by ""heavy"" crews.</p>

Take your TAS, devide it by 60. This is your speed number.</p>

<p>Now take you XWC (crosswind component).
Devide the XWC by your speed number. This is the amount of degrees you should crab to stay on track (wind correction angle)</p>

<p>Lets use an example:</p>

<p>We are flying in a C172 at 120kts TAS.
XWC is 18kts from the left. 
120 devided by 60 is 2, so our speed number is 2.
18kts wind devided by 2 is 9. Now adjust your heading by 9 degrees to the left (into the wind), and you should stay on track. </p>

<p>Why is water-contaminated fuel bad, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_injection_(engine)#Use_in_aircraft"">water-injection</a> is not?</p>

<p>The way I understand it, water-injection lowers the combustion temperature, which is good and bad, good for cool yet increased power-output / mass flow, bad for wasting [unburnt] fuel.</p>

<p>Why is then water dangerous when a <em>trace</em> amount of it is found in fuel? What's the worst that can happen apart from black exhaust and higher power?</p>

<p>Water-injection in jet engines and piston engines is mixed with fuel before it enters the combustion chamber, so I'm thinking fuel already mixed with water should not be any different. Of course I'm wrong. But why?</p>
","<p>Because of the quantity of water in the fuel, as opposed to a careful introduction of water into the combustion process.  Typical water contamination is bad in fuel tanks as water is denser than aviation fuels and settles at the bottom of the tanks.  Aviation fuels are also hydrophobic (non-polar) and so do not readily mix with water.  Therefore water will settle unmixed at the bottom of the tanks, in the fuel sumps or feeder hoppers and when ingested into the engine will fuel starve it and cause it to shut down.  Water in fuel lines can also freeze there during cold weather, causing fuel starvation as well.</p>

<p>Fuel samples should always be taken of the gas when it is both in storage as well as prior to flying the aircraft, especially after rainstorms or the aircraft has sat on the ground for long periods with low fuel in the tanks in a humid environment.  Fuel samples should also be taken approximately 30 minutes after refueling and the gas allowed to settle in the tanks.  A preflight sample of water contamination taken from the fuel tank sumps of a GA aircraft can be seen here.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fkEE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fkEE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Water injection, however carefully controls the amount of water going into the engine along with fuel at the point of combustion, allowing for continued engine operation. </p>

"What is the lifespan of an airline engine?","7494","","<p>As per subject, what is the lifespan of a jet engine? Do they have a fixed hours which they can be used and regardless of the state have to be exchanged or are they serviced and maintained until they are deemed not good for use?</p>

<p>If they do have a lifespan, I suppose also that different types of airliner engines and models will have different lifespans. </p>
","<p>In general, the engine life is measured in terms of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flight hours</li>
<li>Flight cycles</li>
</ul>

<p>A takeoff and a landing counts as a flight cycle. </p>

<p>The most important concept in engine life is the Time Between Overhaul(TBO), which is basically the manufacturer recommended time period after which the engine is stripped down,checked thoroughly and required parts replaced. After overhaul, the engine is usually cleared till the next TBO. </p>

<p>An overhauled engine is theoretically as good as a new one and comes with the same life (TBO) and warranty, if applicable. Airline engines (for example the Rolls Royce Trent series) usually have TBOs of over 15000 hours. The record for maximum time for an engine on wing (i.e. use in aircraft before removal for overhaul) is well over 40,000 hours.</p>

<p>The life of an engine is given by the manufacturer and are different for different engines. However, the engine life depends on a number of parameters and is usually different for various engine components. </p>

<ul>
<li>The rotating components have life limits which are less than the engine and are replaced periodically, mostly during the TBO.</li>
<li>For example, the turbine blades are replaced after a set number of turbine cycles and/or after a set number of hours, which are lesser than the others.</li>
<li>In addition, most rotating components (compressors, turbines) are periodically subjected to checks, and are replaced if found damaged.</li>
<li>In case of abnormal operations, some parts are required to be replaced. For example, if one engine is required to give excessive thrust (for example in case of One Engine Inoperative), the engine is subjected to thorough checks similar to TBO.</li>
</ul>

<p>Airline engines are usually serviced (Overhauled at TBOs) and maintained till they are deemed not good to use or not economical to (service/repair and) operate anymore. </p>

<p>Most of the engine manufacturers employ condition based health monitoring programs, which helps them to plan when to service and repair the engine. As a result, the engine life varies based on its condition.</p>

"Why are there so many different propeller shapes?","7483","","<p>While doing an image search, I found these images of propellers:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lmrr9.jpg"" alt=""prop1""></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4MVWB.jpg"" alt=""prop2""></p>

<p>Some appear to be straight-ish on the leading edge and curved on the trailing, some curved on the leading edge and straght-ish on the trailing, and symmetrically curved and some pretty squared off.</p>

<p>It seems like, well, a propeller is a propeller. They all need to push the air back in a way as to propel (hence the name?) the plane forward.</p>

<p>Wouldn't there be a mathmatically 'best' design?</p>
","<p>The best design depends on what your goal is. This changes with operating conditions:</p>

<p><strong>Best power/thrust ratio</strong></p>

<p>For lightly loaded propellers this would be minimum induced loss. These are the propellers on human-powered aircraft, windmills or motor gliders. Minimum induced loss is achieved by distributing circulation elliptically across the propeller disc, and a typical consequence is a small chord near the tips and a low number of propeller blades. If you want to research this more, I recommend to play around with <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xrotor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">XRotor by Mark Drela</a> (and maybe reading <a href=""http://www.mh-aerotools.de/company/paper_1/epplerhepperle.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>). Mark used it to design the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Daedalus"" rel=""noreferrer"">MLE (below, NASA photo EC87-0014-8) and Dedalus</a> propeller.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IzxXx.jpg"" alt=""MIT MLE in flight""></p>

<p><strong>Maximum thrust at high speed</strong></p>

<p>Highly loaded propellers, which can be found on large turboprop aircraft, are less concerned with induced loss, but need to put out as much thrust as possible with a limited prop area. The diameter is restricted to limit tip speeds, and the tips typically are mildly supersonic. To limit the suction peaks on the blades, the local lift coefficient needs to be low, which is achieved by increasing chord and the number of blades. Increasingly, now tip sweep is also used, but this drives up the torsional loads on the blades and leads to warpage in operation. An extreme example is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_D-27"" rel=""noreferrer"">P-27 prop on the D-27 turboshaft of the An-70 transport</a> (below, picture by Marina Lystseva).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/diYqW.jpg"" alt=""An-70 with P-27 propeller""></p>

<p><strong>Ship propellers</strong></p>

<p>They operate in a medium which is 800 times denser than air, and the main concern is to avoid <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation"" rel=""noreferrer"">cavitation</a>. This again means to limit suction peaks and leads to very high blade chords. To limit draft, ship propellers need to have extremely small diameters.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/huxDy.jpg"" alt=""Five-bladed ship propeller""></p>

<p><strong>Submarine propellers</strong></p>

<p>For submarines, add  minimum noise emission to the design goals. Minimum draft is not a concern, so the propeller blades are less stubby. Their sweep distributes the cutting through the wake of the rudders over time, which helps a lot to reduce noise.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDXwO.jpg"" alt=""Submarine propeller""></p>

<p>The fancy shapes of some model aircraft propellers have more to do with marketing or unscientific voodoo beliefs by some hobbyists. Generally, a straight shape works best.</p>

<p>What kind of signal does it transmit and what kind of range does it have?  I'm guessing that the depth of water that it is in will affect how far away that it can be detected, but by how much?</p>
","<p>This excellent explanation is taken from <a href=""http://www.aea.net/AvionicsNews/ANArchives/FlightDataRecordersJan06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Avionics News</a> in 2006:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FDRs are equipped with an Underwater Locator Beacon (ULB). If you look at a picture of an FDR, you will almost always see a small, cylindrical object attached to one end of the device.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIE0Y.png"" alt=""""></p>
  
  <p>If a plane crashes into the water, this beacon sends out an ultrasonic pulse that cannot be heard by human ears but is readily detectable by sonar and acoustical locating equipment.</p>
  
  <p>There is a submergence sensor on the side of the beacon that looks like a bull's-eye. When water touches this sensor, it activates the beacon.</p>
  
  <p>The beacon sends out pulses at 37.5 kilohertz (kHz) and can transmit sound as deep as 14,000 feet (4,267 m). Once the beacon begins ""pinging"", it pings once per second for 30 days.</p>

"How can an aircraft hover almost vertically?","7386","","<p><img src=""https://fat.gfycat.com/HilariousMassiveBighornedsheep.gif""><br>
<sup>(Source: <a href=""https://fat.gfycat.com/HilariousMassiveBighornedsheep.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://fat.gfycat.com/</a>)</sup></p>

<p>The aircraft in this GIF (although being an RC plane) seems to be flying vertically, just meters above the ground. How is this possible? How is it possible to control it in this scenario? Would this be possible with a real aircraft?</p>
","<p>The aircraft in the video is a remote-controlled (rc) airplane. Why it can ""hover"" is simply:</p>

<p>The thrust generated by a big fan / rc-jet-engine is much higher than the weight of the plane. 
If the force generated by the turbine is the same than the downward-force of weight of the airplane, it hovers.
By very carefully adjusting the thrust and placing the aircraft in this ""nose-up"" position, a skilled rc-pilot can hover the plane until the battery runs out or fuel gets low.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MumJY.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MumJY.png"" alt=""Force explained""></a></p>

<p>As example:
An aircraft that weights 10,000 kg's produces a downforce:</p>

<p>$$F=m\cdot g=10,000 \cdot  9.81  = 98,100N $$ </p>

<p>To make this aircraft hover, you have to create a upward force of min. $98,100 N$. If you manage to do that and you can align the generated thrust / downforce perfectly on the Y-Axis the aircraft will hover:</p>

<p>$F_{down} - F_{up} = 0N$, the two forces will cancel each other out and you don't have any movement in the Y-Axis.</p>

<p>However, if you have engines that create more thrust than the downforce, the following will happen:</p>

<p>$F_{down} - F_{up} \geq 0N$, that means the aircraft will climb vertically (On the Y-Axis).</p>

<p>The same principle applies to other ""real"" aircraft, like the Sea-Harrier:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYtct.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYtct.jpg"" alt=""Sea Harrier hover""></a></p>

<p>It uses the engine to create a force facing upwards. Because the force is greater than the downward-force created by the aircrafts weight, the Harrier can land / takeoff vertically.</p>

<p>The hovering airctaft is controlled by a trust-vectoring fan / turbine. Controlling the plane with the ""normal"" surfaces is not possible, because the airflow over the controll-surfaces on the wing is to slow. Therefore, only planes with trust-vectoring capabilities COULD hover like the rc-plane in your question.</p>

"Is it possible to use thrust reversers to taxi backwards?","7346","","<p>Can commercial airliners theoretically taxi backwards using reverse thrust?</p>

<p>If this is possible, why isn't it common? </p>

<p>I can already imagine some safety reasons...</p>
","<p>This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerback"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Powerback</a>, most aircraft can do it, but it is not done very often.</p>

<p>In a jet aircraft, the three main problems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reverse thrust tends to throw a lot of debris into the air because the exhaust is deflected to the sides and up and down too. This debris can damage the engine itself, other things on and around the aircraft or injure someone on the ramp. It is less of a problem for aircraft with tail-mounted engines (so DC-9s often used powerback), but that engine configuration is not used as much any more in transport aircraft, as it is less aerodynamically efficient.  </li>
<li>A related problem is that the compressor might suck in its own hot exhaust gases. This might lead to temperature-induced damages in the last (high-pressure) stages of the compressor and health issues for passengers, since the air conditioning system works with bleed air from the compressor.</li>
<li>Reverse thrust is rather inefficient on jet engines, so it uses a lot of fuel.</li>
<li>As <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8084/taxiing-backwards-with-reverse-thrust/8086#comment14108_8086"">Casey mentioned in the comment below</a>, the pilot has to be careful using the brakes during powerback: the main wheels are very close behind the centre of gravity, so harder braking can lift the nose wheel, causing the pilot to lose control and even causing damage to the tail if it hits the ground (“tail-tipping”).</li>
</ul>

<p>So a tug is both cheaper and safer.</p>

<p>In propeller aircraft, reverse is more efficient and does not throw up as much debris, so it is sometimes used. But a tug is still preferred because transport aircraft don't have any rear visibility, so the pilots can't see where they are taxiing. With tug the driver can see behind the aircraft, and a ground marshaller walks along side each wingtip with an intercom  connected to the plane.</p>

<p>Lastly, since aircraft are able to turn almost on the spot using differential braking and thrust and 180-degree nosewheel steering, at airports with few facilities there is generally enough space around the aircraft to permit the pilot to reverse out easily.</p>

Do the similarity only end in the size and shape? Do they not perform equally well in similar roles? <strong>While Boeing 747 is used for commercial airlines, why isn't Lockheed C-5 Galaxy? Similarly, why is C-5 galaxy popular for Military and 747 isn't?</strong> </p>
","<p>C-5 Galaxy was designed to military requirements that for cargo aircraft include:</p>

<ul>
<li>operating from unpaved runways (I am not sure in case of C-5, but probably yes)</li>
<li>operating from airfields without much support</li>
<li>operating from short runways</li>
<li>paradrop capability</li>
</ul>

<p>These basically imply a high-wing design so that engines are high (to minimize risk of foreign object damage) and the deck is lower for easier loading, front and rear cargo door with loading ramps so loading is possible without any ground infrastructure and some excess thrust for sufficient performance on short fields.</p>

<p>However that design is <em>less efficient</em>. It has higher operating cost. The air force is willing to pay it, because it needs the capabilities it requested. But commercial operations don't need those things, because it has enough well equipped airports to operate from. So the higher cost of operating an L-500 (as civil version of C-5 would be called) makes it uninteresting.</p>

<p>B-747 only shares one design feature with C-5, the raised cockpit that allows full-height cargo door in the nose, but otherwise it is optimized to minimize operating cost, making it great cargo plane for operations between airports.</p>

<hr>

<p>On a side note, there is <em>some</em> commercial demand for transporting heavy or large cargo to less equipped airports.

"Why are we still putting lead in our fuel?","7270","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead"">Lead in gasoline</a> for automobiles has been banned from nearly every corner of the world, with most bans dating from the nineties. Why are we still poisoning ourselves with lead in Avgas? I understand that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead"">Tetraethyllead</a> (as it's apparently technically called) is an octane booster, but the Wikipedia article also mentions that advances in the production of high octane unleaded fuel have pretty much nullified that argument. There are more reasons of course, but none the automotive industry wasn't unable to overcome many decades ago. I know it's 'low-lead' with very little lead compared to 'traditional' gasoline, but the phase-out of leaded fuels in cars started back in the 1970s, so don't tell me that most aircraft are simply too old. Are aircraft engines so special compared to car engines, that they must get their <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/quotes?item=qt0324290"">fix of lead before they go flying</a>?</p>

<p>It is also a fact that there are aircraft piston engines which do run perfectly fine on unleaded fuel, why is it that hardly any airport offers it? Even in cost-conscious and eco-friendly Europe, most airports offer only 100LL and Jet fuel.</p>
","<p>There is nothing ""special"" about an aircraft engine that requires lead in the fuel -- Engines don't much care about the lead in tetraethyl lead, nor do they much care <em>for</em> it (it gets everywhere, fouling sparkplugs and contaminating the oil). What they care about is the octane (anti-knock) rating of the fuel.</p>

<p>Many ""low performance"" aircraft engines run just fine on unleaded fuels with a lower octane rating (among them the Lycoming O-320 and O-360 family that power a good chunk of the GA fleet), but high-performance aircraft engines (e.g. the IO-520 you'll find in Beech Bonanzas) require a 100 octane fuel. The approved specification for 100 octane aviation gasoline (<a href=""http://www.astm.org/Standards/D910.htm"">ASTM D910</a>) lists tetraethyl lead as the octane booster of choice.  </p>

<p>It's also worth noting that some of the octane boosting techniques used in automotive gasoline are not acceptable for aircraft engines (the most common in the US being the addition of ethanol, which has two undesirable effects: reducing the energy content of the fuel, and damaging aviation fuel system seals and other components).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So why do we still make 100LL, and why don't we offer the other unleaded options at every airport?</strong></p>

<p>Aviation gasoline is a <em>minuscule</em> slice of the gasoline market, so it doesn't make sense to have 5 tanks with 5 different grades of fuel at every airport:<br>
All aircraft engines will run on 100LL, so 100LL (leaded) aviation gasoline is still produced because it is a ""single fuel"" solution to piston aviation's needs.</p>

<p>If leaded avgas were to disappear tomorrow the engines that require it would be left without an approved fuel, which would result in those aircraft being grounded until such time as an alternative fuel could be developed or the engine manufacturers develop a procedure for derating the engines (operating them at reduced power). For obvious reasons neither of these options is attractive, particularly to folks who own higher-power engines which were presumably purchased for the performance...</p>

<p>Changing the avgas specification is quite a bit of work - it requires ensuring that the new fuel is a ""drop-in replacement"" for 100LL -- one which can be mixed with 100LL in any proportion, and will work correctly in any engine designed for 100LL fuel.<br>
<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/avgas/"">The FAA is working with engine manufacturers and major fuel producers on a program which will result in such a specification</a> (a Google search for <code>unleaded avgas transition</code> also produces useful results), and hopefully a universal unleaded aviation fuel specification and one or more products will come out of those efforts.</p>

"Would it be feasible to build a jet fighter plane based on a wooden construction?","7268","","<p>I read about the <a href=""https://www.warhistoryonline.com/military-vehicle-news/mosquito-best-warbird-wwii-color.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">de Havilland Mosquito</a> recently and that it was a quite successful British bomber in WW2 due its lightweight wooden construction. As far as I understand it, usual planes at that time were built mainly with metal parts already, thus heavier than the Mosquito and hence uncatchable for them. Furthermore it was too fast for getting hit by heavy anti air, namely the German 88mm cannon. </p>

<p>With this traits of a wooden construction, I wonder if it is feasible to build jets mainly of wood and give them a boost in speed. I have doubts however that the wooden construction is stable enough for resisting the hefty g-force mid-air while flying in mach 3 speed.</p>
","<p>Yes it would be possible to build a fighter plane from wood, not one that can fly at Mach 3 however. There are some olden days examples of fighter planes using wood construction, here is another one from 1938: the Fokker G.1. with a wooden wing. These planes don't look like F16s, but were subject to fully aerobatic g-forces. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbBUj.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbBUj.gif"" alt=""From the Wiki""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/1077"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This document of 1941</a> provides an overview of knowledge of aeronautical wood construction. Wood is a light construction material, and one of the largest aircraft ever built, the Spruce Goose, was made entirely of wood. Wood also has asymmetrical strength properties: it is much stronger in line with the grain than perpendicular to it, one of the main advantages cited for composites. We could follow the same construction method as for composites: shave off thin layers of wood and embed them in resin, line up the majority of the grain in the direction of greatest stress, and use some alternate grain directions like in plywood to create sufficient strength and stiffness in all directions.</p>

<p>If we consider the properties of aeroplane construction materials:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Strength.</p>

<p>Wood has a specific strength that is slightly lower than that of aluminium: spruce has a compression strength of 27.5 N/mm$^2$ = 27.5 MPa, and a density of 418 kg/m$^3$. Compare this with untempered 7075 aluminium alloy: a tensile strength of 280 MPa and a density of 2,810 kg/m$^3$. Aircraft aluminium alloy is 10.2 times as strong and 6.7 times as heavy as spruce, so its specific strength is 10.2/6.7 = 1.52 that of spruce. But half of the wing is compression loaded, and a thicker skin made of a lighter material buckles less easily. So for wings with a high aspect ratio, part of aluminium's weight advantage is traded in: compressed skin is dimensioned on skin thickness, not on yield strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Heat resistance/flammability</p>

<p>Aircraft aluminium alloys yield strength reduces as a function of temperature, as indicated in the graph below (<a href=""https://www.nakka-rocketry.net/pix/ftycht2.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>). The red line is for 2024 aluminium: at 250 °C, the tensile strength (= compression strength) is halved.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8CFm.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8CFm.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Compare this with the compression strength of spruce: halved at around 150 °C (Source: fig 5-14 of <a href=""http://www.woodweb.com/Resources/wood_eng_handbook/wood_handbook_fpl_2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Wood Handbook</a>). There are two graph regions for different moisture contents, and that brings us to the main disadvantage of wood: the variability of a natural material, next under point 3.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C89q2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C89q2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>But of course the main point of attention would be using a jet engine in a wooden frame. Even the G.1 had an aluminium front engine construction.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency and weather resistance</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/1077"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AIRCRAFT WOODS: Their Properties, Selection, and Characteristics</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the principal factors tending to restrict the use of wood are a not unlimited supply of the most desirable species; a hygroscopicity that results in shrinking and swelling and changes in strength; and a wide difference in properties with different directions of the grain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These disadvantages can be partially undone by using plywood, however this has an additional weight penalty.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Wood has not been used for several decades for constructing airliners or fighters, and for a good reason. Fokker successfully built wooden monoplane aircraft in the 1920/1930s, until a high visibility <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1931_Transcontinental_%26_Western_Air_Fokker_F-10_crash"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">crash of an F.X</a> brought this construction method under scrutiny. Not long after, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_247"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing 247</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DC-2</a> pioneered aluminium smooth skin aeroplane construction, and the industry has never looked back.</p>

<p>So yes, a fighter can be built out of wood and would be strong enough. However it would be heavier, prone to weather influences, and cause of major headaches for integrating a jet engine into its flammable construction. It cannot fly at Mach 3: the SR-71 needed to be built out of titanium, not aluminium, due to the heat resistance required. Spruce would not stand a chance and go up in flames.</p>

<p>There are no good reasons to <em>not</em> build a fighter jet from metal or nowadays composits.</p>

"How do airports determine when they should change their runway numbers?","7250","","<p>Runway numbers in most of the world are based on the runway's orientation relative to magnetic north.  For example a runway with a magnetic heading of 135° to 144° will be numbered <code>14</code>, and one with a magnetic heading of 145° to 154° will be numbered <code>15</code>.<br>
Runway numbers are <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24613702/earths-magnetic-shift-causes-first-change-runway-numbers"">occasionally changed</a> due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field.</p>

My understanding is that this runway should, at some point, be renumbered <code>15/33</code>.  </p>

<p>How does the FAA determine when to request that an airport change its runway numbers?<br>
Is the decision to update the runway designation made by the FAA, or by the airport's management?</p>
","<p>Implementing changes to runway numbers is quite complicated and requires a lot of different parties to get involved.  There is a ton of related information in <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/8260.19E.pdf"">FAA Order 8260.19E</a> and it has the details.</p>

<h1>Simple Version</h1>

<p>According to an article by the NBAA called ""<a href=""http://www.nbaa.org/ops/airports/20110314-magnetic-north.php"">How Changes in Magnetic North Are Impacting Airports</a>"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Adjustments to runways like this and to navigational aids are
  ongoing,” according the Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the FAA
  Southern Region. “Every five years, the FAA reevaluates shifts in the
  pole—its magnetic variation—and makes changes to runways and flight
  procedures as needed,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Medium Version</h1>

<p>NOAA, NOS, and NGS (see below) provide the magnetic variation information, and publish it every five years.  They work with a bunch of different offices, and different branches of the military as they make adjustments.  When a determination is made that a runway number should be changed, they coordinate with several other groups (such as AeroNav Products, OSG-FPT, the applicable Airportt Traffic Service Area Office, and the Airports Division), to choose the actual number used, based on ""careful consideration and evaluation of a number of factors"" and then to make the actual changes in charting, runway markings and signs, etc.  </p>

<p>They are supposed to change it when it is more than three degrees off from what it is <em>should</em> to be.  <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150_5340_1l.pdf"">AC 150/5340-1L - Standards for Airport Markings</a> contains the official runway designator rules (paraphrased):  If the actual magnetic course of the runway ends in 5, it can use either number, otherwise you round to the closest runway number (there are some variations for special cases like parallel runways and such, but this covers most runways). So in your example, 145 is still valid as runway 14, and they wouldn't need to change it until it exceeds 148 deg.  In your case, the annual rate of change for Farmingdale airport (as of 2010) is 0.0 deg East, so I don't see that happening for awhile.  </p>

<h1>Long Version - Quotes from FAA Order 8260.19E (above)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 5. Implementing Epoch Year Magnetic Variation (MV)</strong></p>
  
  <p>a. <strong>Background.</strong> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
  (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), and the National Geodetic
  Survey (NGS), for all areas of the United States and its territories
  for application to navigation charts and maps, is the source for
  magnetic variation (MV) information and tools for establishing
  magnetic variation. Changing values for MV are tabulated and published on
  a 5-year epoch basis; e.g., 00, 05, 10, 15, 20, etc. In order to
  assist in stabilizing the National Airspace System (NAS), a fixed
  value of MV is assigned to each  navigational aid and airport as the
  Magnetic Variation of Record. This value is applied to true 
  directions to obtain the magnetic values for radials, courses,
  bearings, and headings published in instrument flight procedures.
  Periodic updating of the MV assigned to navigation facilities is 
  required to maintain reasonable proximity of alignment with the
  earth’s ever-changing magnetic field. ... </p>
  
  <p>b.
  <strong>Participating Offices.</strong> Management and control of Epoch Year MV values
  require action  by the following offices:<br>
  (1) AeroNav Products.<br>
  (2) Military Organizations.<br>
  (3) National Flight Data Center (NFDC).<br>
  (4) Western, Central, and Eastern Technical Operations.<br>
  (5) Western, Central, and Eastern OSG-FPTs.<br>
  (6) Regional Airports Divisions.</p>
  
  <p>...  </p>
  
  <p>f. <strong>Regional Airports Division/Airports District Office (ADO).</strong>
  Coordinate with the  applicable OSG-FPT prior to establishing or
  revising runway designator numbers for an airport  having one or more
  instrument approach or departure procedures, to determine the
  appropriate MV to be applied to the runway true bearing. Determination
  of the runway designator number should be a matter of joint agreement
  with AeroNav Products, and be accomplished sufficiently in advance to
  allow for procedural amendments. Take appropriate NOTAM action if
  repainting of an affected runway has not been accomplished on the
  required date.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>2-18. <strong>Guidelines</strong>. The identification and selection of navigational
  aids or airports as candidates for revision of MV of Record require
  careful consideration and evaluation of a number of factors - as the
  impact of MV changes can be considerable. The applicable Air Traffic
  Service Area Office may have to initiate or revise published air
  traffic procedures; the Technical Operations Service (AJW-0) is
  directly involved in facility rotations and requires proper
  coordination. The Airports Division, or appropriate military
  authority, may have to arrange for repainting of runway designator
  numbers [see paragraph 8-58e(2)(e)].</p>
  
  <p>a. MV versus Epoch Year Value. When the difference between the MV of
  Record and the nearest future Epoch Year value of any navigational aid
  or airport is 3 degrees or more, the MV of Record must be changed to
  the nearest future Epoch Year value.</p>

"How can I avoid flight simulator software reinforcing bad habits?","7247","","<p>While looking into getting into flying I've seen in several sources that using flight simulator software typically creates and reinforces bad habits. Most articles say that it reinforces ""instrument"" flying which is not practical.</p>

<p>Is there some other action I should incorporate into learning to fly that would maybe help me avoid focusing too much on the instruments? Or would the simple introduction of things like pedals, flight sticks, etc be enough help to avoid this issue?</p>
","<p>The best recommendation I can give you is to get a VR headset. Yes, they're a bit pricey, but not bad at all compared to actual flight hours in a real airplane. Practicing for visual flight just isn't very good with normal monitors.</p>

<p>Personally, I had been playing around with flight sim games for years before I ever flew a real airplane. I do agree that, if done only with normal monitors, it can train you to rely too much on the instruments. For the first maybe 2 flights that I performed in a real airplane, my CFI complained that I was spending too much time looking down at the artificial horizon on the attitude indicator, rather than looking at the actual horizon out the window. That said, after a couple of flights in the real thing, that problem was solved, so it really wasn't that big of a deal. Already being familiar with how the flight controls and instruments work vastly outweighed the need to 'unlearn' that habit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my primary training in the real airplane had some large gaps in it. Not long after my first solo, I had a gap of about 2 years between flights, due primarily to grad school, for example. Before I started flying again, I tried using the flight sim to get back in practice. However, even with yoke, pedals, throttle, trim wheel, etc., it was difficult to practice the sorts of visual flying that you do in primary flight training. I had a 3-monitor setup, but it still wasn't enough to be able to, for example, look over my left shoulder at the runway when flying a pattern. Yes, you can pan the view around, but it's not really the same.</p>

<p>Fortunately, shortly after that time, VR headsets came on the market. I purchased one along with an FSX add-on that integrates the headset with FSX. For visual flying, the difference is enormous. Aside from the lack of actually feeling the forces, things like flying a traffic pattern and just general visual flying are very near the real thing, especially if you can get a good model of the airplane that you're actually going to be flying. Just being able to turn your head to the left and see the runway out the window while flying a pattern is incredibly helpful, for example. The same is true for practicing other visual maneuvers, such as turns around a point. And, of course, if you have a good model, the inside of the airplane looks almost exactly like it does in real life. It's much, much more realistic than trying to pan the view around on static monitors.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'd recommend downloading a good terrain scenery pack for the area where you'll be flying. Rather than having the stock FSX terrain that just uses generic textures to represent forested land, small cities, fields, etc., a good, high-resolution scenery pack looks very much like the real thing, especially when combined with a VR headset. I was able to download one for my entire U.S. state (which, for comparison, is about 3 times the size of Switzerland) for a pretty small price. When they say this is high-resolution, they're not joking. Not only can I see my house, I can see individual trees in my yard. It's that good. This is very helpful for practicing visual flight, since you can see the actual landmarks that you'd using for visual navigation in real life.</p>

"Why was the production of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird halted?","7242","","<p>Why was production of Lockheed's SR-71 Blackbird halted, given that it was an advanced supersonic jet that was ahead of its time?</p>
","<h2>Why did they stop building it?</h2>

<p>Because they built 32, and that was as many as was needed at the time. 32 spy planes was plenty for the USAF/CIA to use, so building more would have been a waste. By the time those airframes may have needed to be replaced after 30 years or so, the SR-71 had been withdrawn from service and there was no need to build any more.</p>

<p>I think the question you're really trying to ask, though, is:</p>

<h2>Why was it withdrawn from service?</h2>

<p><strong>And why wasn't it replaced when it was withdrawn?</strong></p>

<p>The answer to those questions is a bit more complex, but essentially comes down to ""Because it wasn't really needed any more.""</p>

<p>The SR-71 was designed and built in the 50's and 60's. That means it was designed shortly before the first space flight, and built shortly afterward.</p>

<p>When designed, there was a huge need for a fast, ""impossible to shoot down"" reconnaissance aircraft. The SR-71 suited that - it could dodge missiles just by outrunning them, and by the time any adversary scrambled a fighter and got to the SR-71's altitude, the SR-71 would be a couple of hundred miles away and possibly even over a different country.</p>

<p><strong>So what happened?</strong></p>

<p>Satellites happened.</p>

<p>Why maintain a fleet of very high maintenance planes and keep them on high alert, then fly them over your rival's airspace? That's expensive, time consuming, difficult, risky, and (quite understandably) tends to upset your rival. It was, in short, an expensive way to annoy Russia and China. Okay sure, it got some reconnaissance too, and did its job (as an aircraft) beautifully, but when times are tense the last thing you need is to antagonise each other.</p>

<p>As an aircraft, then, it was a huge success... but as a geopolitical pawn, and as a military asset? It's a little more questionable. It certainly performed a vital role, but it had negative downsides from doing that.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, and we developed reconnaissance satellites with a whole bunch of advantages</p>

<ul>
<li>With a few of them in the right orbit, you can have a satellite over an interesting part of the world pretty much 24/7. Even without that many, you can pass over an area pretty regularly.</li>
<li>Less obvious. Okay, your rival does not like you launching them - but once in space they're just ""there"", there's no antagonising ""Oh look, an SR-71 flying over us""</li>
<li>They're ""fire and forget"" for the most part. Once in space, you just use it: you don't need to keep a bunch of pilots and aircraft on the ground ready to fly</li>
<li>It's less obvious what you're looking at, and when... if an SR-71 flies over the base that contains your new secret weapon, you're gonna notice. But when a satellite flies over for the 18th time today? Not so much</li>
<li>No planning and preparation time (which, for an SR-71, was a huge undertaking).  You just start taking pictures, or wait for a satellite to get to the right place, then start taking pictures.</li>
</ul>

<p>They have disadvantages, too</p>

<ul>
<li>For 24/7 coverage, you need quite a lot of them, and they aren't cheap</li>
<li>You have to replace them occasionally (and/or boost them into higher orbits)</li>
<li>If you upgrade your camera, it's a lot harder to replace the one on a satellite than an SR-71</li>
</ul>

<p>But overall, a satellite is a more reliable, less antagonistic way to spy on your rivals. They're not perfect, but you know you've got permanent spying capability with no need to plan your reconnaissance ahead of time.</p>

<p>In short: It wasn't needed anymore.</p>

"Why should some piston engines not be run lean of peak?","7233","","<p>Leaving aside the claimed <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2011/May/1/Dogfight-Running-lean-of-peak"">pros and cons</a> of lean-of-peak (LOP) vs. rich-of-peak (ROP), the C172S Lycoming IO-360-L2A handbook I have says ""Continuous operation at mixture settings lean of peak EGT is prohibited"", and indeed I was always taught to run the engine ROP.</p>

<p>Obviously you should always follow the POH for your aircraft, but considering piston engines in general, why would running LOP be prohibited? </p>
","<p>Considering piston engines in general there's a few reasons not to run ""lean of peak"", but the arguments I'm aware of all fall into three broad categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Poor Instrumentation</strong><br>
Most folks advocating Lean-of-Peak engine operation will also tell you that you need a good engine monitor (with Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT) probes for <em>each cylinder</em>) so you can ensure that all your cylinders are operating within safe temperature limits.<br>
Manufacturer CHT/EGT systems are often ""single-probe"". On the IO-360 in your Cessna example that leaves you with a 3 cylinder blind spot in your monitoring, and the potential risk of damaging your engine based on the incomplete information you have.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uneven mixture distribution</strong><br>
Some engines simply <em>can't</em> run lean of peak because of uneven mixture distribution: Either the engine will get rough as some cylinders ""miss"", or you'll have some cylinders lean of peak EGT and at a safe cylinder head temperature while others are redlining their CHT and potentially causing damage to your engine.<br>
This sort of uneven mixture distribution happens frequently in carbureted engines, but there are many injected engines which also have poor fuel distribution &amp; significant variation in mixture between cylinders (This is where GAMIJectors makes their money - by providing balanced injectors to even out fuel distribution).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>""In Case Something Breaks""</strong><br>
Hypothetical scenario: you are cruising at 8000 feet, you've leaned for cruise, and your mixture control suddenly fails in such a way that your engine is stuck at the current mixture setting.  All the airports within your endurance range are roughly at sea level.<br>
An engine running lean of peak may begin to run rough as you descend for landing (the mixture becomes too lean to support combustion).  An engine running rich of peak may continue to run acceptably through the descent. (The mixture may transition into <a href=""http://www.oshkosh365.org/saarchive/eaa_articles/2012_12_08.pdf"">""the red box zone""</a> where operation at high power settings are dangerous, but you'll theoretically be reducing power for your descent, so the chance of doing damage to your engine isn't that high unless you have to perform a go-around or other high-power maneuver.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>A prohibition on Lean-of-Peak operation in your POH is probably historically based on #1 or #2 above -- the manufacturer doesn't want to advise you to do something that might damage your engine.  Running Rich-of-Peak is conservative operating guidance, where the downside is slightly increased fuel consumption and the possibility of fouling a spark plug (which is not likely at normal operating power settings) versus the downside of potential engine damage from improper Lean-of-Peak operation.</p>

"Why does an aircraft not spin out of control right after touch-down?","7228","","<p>When a plane is landing, how does it not immediately start spinning out of control? </p>

<p>Given the massive amount of forward momentum and the fact that all the various braking forces (wheel brakes, spoilers, thrust reversers) are applied separately on each side of the plane, if there was even a small imbalance between the two sides wouldn't the plane want to start spinning (yawing) in that direction? </p>

<p>Is this something a pilot has to account for while landing or is there some physical effect that makes it Just Work?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>how does it not immediately start spinning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physics, and engineering. But I guess that you would like a bit more detail, so let's try dive in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>wheel brakes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They tend to have a stabilizing effect by shifting some of the weight on the front wheel and allowing the pilots to control the aircraft with more effectiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>spoilers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are automatically controlled by the Fly-by-Wire system, so if required they would be retracted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>thrust reversers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they are functioning properly, the resulting force will go through the vertical plane containing the C.o.G. (but a bit below it), so they do not pose much of a problem.</p>

<p>Another thing you have not mentioned, but I am going to add, is crabbed landings (such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roS6oFjCDhc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>), since in these situations the aircraft DO tend to spin a little.
In these cases, in the timeframe between touchdown and braking, 2 things help the aircraft remain on the runway: the vertical tail (with the rudder), and the position of the main landing gear w.r.t. the center of gravity of the aircraft. As it can be seen in <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3f64G.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this image</a> taken from the lecture notes of the course I followed (the title translates to ""Braking run in crabbed landing""), normal tricycle gear aircraft tend to be stabilized by their own landing gear in this situation, while the same cannot be said for old school taildraggers.</p>

<p>So, what really could cause a problem? The answer is wind gusts (especially if the wind is perpendicular to the runway), uneven conditions of the runway (say, a puddle or a thin layer of ice on one side of the runway will cause one set of main gear to have less grip than its counterpart on the other side, causing a yawing towards the side with more grip), asymmetrical failures in the thrust reversers, excessive braking while also turning the aircraft to realign to the centerline (particularly a problem if the distance between the two main gears is not sufficient).</p>

<p>How does the aircraft remain on the runway despite these possible problems? At high speeds, thanks to the vertical tail; and at low speeds thanks to the front nose gear. At in-between speeds, the situation is slightly more complicated: the tail is not much useful anymore, while the front gear would risk breaking if used to correct too much. So, for example, a FbW system can help through the asymmetrical use of spoilers.
An example of what could happen, but seen during a take-off, is illustrated <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS1YAX70edc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this video</a> (video kindly provided by MichaelK in chat).</p>

Has there been other cases like this one where someone stole a large aircraft? If so, what is the largest aircraft to ever been stolen, preferably by a single person?</p>

<p>(To clarify, I'm doing some research for a story I'm writing. I don't plan to beat the record, rest assured.)</p>
","<p>Probably <a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/the-727-that-vanished-2371187/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the one you stated in your question</a>.  Though, I should note, that there is some credible evidence that only one person was actually flying the plane and the other may have been forced into coming along.  So you could probably consider it to have been stolen by one person, and that person appears to have not been remotely qualified to fly it.  When it was leaving the plane seemed to meander down the taxiway to the runway, like the pilot had no idea what they were doing, and then it took off.  It hasn't been seen since, and most credible theories think it crashed in the ocean.  But <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Boeing_727-223_disappearance#Theories"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conspiracy theories</a> abound.</p>

<p>A close second would probably be <a href=""http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19991011-0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this ATR-42-320</a>(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_72"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a> plane reference), also stolen in Africa.  This time by an employee of the company who was, unfortunately, suicidal.  He flew the plane around the airport for a few minutes demanding to speak to everyone from his boss, to his significant other to the president of the country.  He eventually crashed it into a couple of other ATR's the company owned.</p>

<p>In reference to the ""I'm writing a story"" line.  I would suggest that a 727 probably isn't the optimal plane for a single person to steal.  They're older and difficult to manage on your own.  I think a much better option would be a more modern aircraft, like an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350_XWB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Airbus A350</a> or a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing 787</a>.  They have avionics that allow for one person to reasonably fly the plane.  </p>

<p>Granted, they are very new and may be harder to steal.  Probably the sweet spot between ""new enough to be flyable by one person"" and ""old enough to have one just sitting around to be stolen"" would be something like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">737-800</a> or an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Airbus A320</a>.

<p>Why do some aircraft use double engines? </p>
","<p>Some countries don't get the most powerful engines and have to use what is available in the market. To avoid upsetting China too much, the US would not sell the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_F404"">F404</a> or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_F100"">F100</a> to Taiwan, and a derivative of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_TFE731"">civilian engine</a> had to be developed.</p>

<p>A second reason is redundancy: When the US Navy had to decide between the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon"">F-16</a> and what <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_YF-17"">was to become the F-18</a>, they preferred the design with two engines, because losing your only engine over water is a much more life-threatening experience than losing it over land. Similarly, the Eurofighter was designed more for peace than for war - having two engines will reduce training losses.</p>

<p>Generally, a single, bigger engine will be more powerful and more efficient per unit of mass, because manufacturing tolerances will be relatively smaller in the bigger engine, if the same technology is used for both. Single engines need to have more system redundancy than one of a pair of engines, so some of that advantage cannot be transferred into the finished design. Nevertheless, from a performance standpoint the single engine fighter will look better.</p>

"Why are dirt and bugs on an aircraft so bad?","7203","","<p>It's noted in many POHs to keep your aircraft clean all the time, but is there a reason to this?  Dirt hardly add any sort of weight to the aircraft, bugs are extremely small and other things such as cars easily move even when dirty as a mud pig.  </p>

<p>Does having dirt or bugs on your aircraft seriously affect the structure or performance signficantly?<br>
If so, why?</p>
","<p>For (modern) gliders with highly optimized laminar flow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil"" rel=""noreferrer"">airfoils</a>, bugs (or dirt) are a non-negligible factor, especially in competition gliding. There are some older laminar airfoils that are notoriously allergic to bugs (and rain), but all are to a certain degree. This is also the reason why any glider pilot worth his or her salt will painstakingly clean their ship each afternoon and before each competition flight.</p>

<p>Sufficient bugs will degrade your performance by a noticeable amount - most gliding computers even have a special ""bug"" factor to include that into glide path calculation (even though the measuring and correllation of that is quite subjective). I´ve had a few flights in somewhat biblically bug-infested conditions (summer, hot, low thermals) that more or less painted the leading edge black (like in this picture from an <a href=""http://www.dg-flugzeugbau.de/mueckenputzer-e.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">article on the DG Flugzeugbau website</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AilMW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Bug wipers are quite common on high-end and competition gliders and can be found e.g. at <a href=""http://www.storka.at/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.storka.at/</a>. Or try to google for ""Mückenputzer"". Of course bug wipers are not without drawbacks (concerning cost, installation, ease of use, drag etc.). A friend of mine once stuck a banana peel on his wing and tried to remove that with the wiper, resulting in banana <em>and</em> wiper being stuck in the middle of the wing. It took some creative maneuvers to clear <em>that</em> mess, by which time probably a lifetime aerodynamic benefit of cleaning had been spent.</p>

<p>As for the comparison with cars, their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_aerodynamics"" rel=""noreferrer"">aerodynamics</a> differ in a lot of ways. In comparison to a wing there is no laminar flow to talk of at higher speeds (most of it is turbulent), which drastically reduces the influence of the surface smoothness on the drag produced.</p>

"What should you do when ATC gives you a number to call to discuss a violation?","7201","","<p>Generally speaking, for those that either have experience calling <em>the number</em>, or, preferably, for those that were paid to answer the phone, what are the benefits or pitfalls of calling?</p>

<p>Are there any scenarios, such as gross violations, where it might be better to seek legal counsel first before calling, or not calling at all--especially if there is a discrepancy between airman and controller?</p>
","<p>AOPA has <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/inst_reports2.cfm?article=6615"">an article</a> on exactly this question (written by an attorney). Their advice is basically that it's a judgement call on your part and one that you should think about carefully. Not calling may antagonize the FAA, but calling if it's a major safety issue may be unwise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that you should call the
  telephone number or respond to the FAA's letter, and blather the most
  expansive defense you can conjure up. A little judgment is called for
  here--and, unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules. If you
  think the FAA may be inclined to just admonish you orally or content
  itself with administrative action, then a humble, cooperative approach
  may be best. Saying you won't talk without a lawyer, when the likely
  outcome if you do talk is minor, may only prompt the FAA to propose
  sterner action. Before you talk, however, think carefully about what
  you want to say, how much to say, what questions the FAA is likely to
  ask and how you'll answer them.</p>
  
  <p>If, on the other hand, there is a substantial chance the FAA will take
  certificate action against you or will propose a fine, the best course
  of action, as I said above, is to hire an attorney. Don't ignore the
  FAA; be polite, but don't provide more information than the bare
  outlines of what is already known and obvious to all. State quietly
  that you understand the FAA's desire to investigate possible
  violations, that you take your obligations to fly safely very
  seriously, and that you will be happy to cooperate. Also say that,
  unless the FAA is not contemplating action against you, you feel it
  best to consult a lawyer before proceeding. Since the FAA likely won't
  give you any guarantees, its representative will be the one
  overreaching if he presses you to respond anyway. Politely decline if
  he does.</p>

<ul>
<li>File a <a href=""http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/report/electronic.html"">NASA ASRS form</a> within the 10-day limit, whatever happened</li>
<li>If you know what you did wrong and you know it was minor, then make the call</li>
<li>If you don't know what you did wrong then call but be prepared to end the conversation immediately if you have no good response or you realize it's more serious than you thought</li>
<li>If you know you caused a major safety issue (actual or potential) then don't call and get a lawyer instead</li>
<li>If you know the person you have to call  - e.g. if it's the tower controller at your home airport - then you should give more weight to calling</li>
<li>In general, it's better to call and have to cut off the conversation than not to call in the first place</li>
<li>Whatever you say, keep it short and factual</li>
<li>When you find out what you did wrong, get some ground and/or flight training from an instructor to address that specific issue and have him endorse it in your logbook; this shows the FAA that you've taken the issue seriously and you've actively taken steps to make sure you won't do it again</li>

","<p>It's perfectly legal, but check the Chart Supplement (or AFD, or instrument approaches) to see if there are <em>special exceptions</em> for that airport.</p>

<p>It's also common for larger airports to have <em>preferred directions</em> for arrival or departures in order to keep the flight volume high, even when the wind prefers other runways.</p>

"Are nuclear bombers themselves damaged after dropping bombs?","7124","","<p>Shock waves resulting from low intensity explosions can easily <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_explosive_detonation_velocities"">reach</a> 10,000m/s.  About 5% of the energy released in a nuclear air burst is in the form of ionizing radiation: neutrons, gamma rays, alpha particles and electrons moving at speeds up to the <strong>speed of light</strong> (thus, carrying a hell of a lot of energy).  With these stats it appears that for the bomber as well, a nuclear bomb is very bad. How are they protected? </p>
","<h1>Mostly, no.</h1>

<p>The number one factor protecting the aircraft from the effects of the explosion is distance. The aircraft is traveling at a sufficient speed to be very, very far away from the bomb before it detonates. All effects of the explosion can be multiplied by the fraction: 1 / r, where r is the distance between the bomb and the bomber at donation (because circumference is directly proportional to radius). While the effects may be great at the target, they spread out as the circle grows.</p>

<h1>Detailed Analysis:</h1>

<p>As you emphasize the speed of light of radiation from nuclear reactions, I would like to write something about radiation and how it could influence the aircraft.</p>

<h1>Radioactivity</h1>

<p>Nuclear radiation consists of gamma rays, which are some sort of EM waves and particles like helium nuclei (alpha), electrons (beta) and neutrons (without Greek letter...). There is also some more stuff like positrons, protons or heavier fragments of the nuclei, but they behave similarly.</p>

<p>The particles indeed escape with a large fraction of the speed of light, but this has nothing to do with the nuke. They will escape with the same speed from a nuclear reactor or from tiny probes in a lab. The nuke just spills more particles than the probe, but does not give them more speed.</p>

<h2>Alpha &amp; beta radiation</h2>

<p>You may know you can stop alpha particles by a piece of paper and beta particles by a 3mm sheet of aluminium. In air (ground, room temperature), alpha particles can travel not more than 10cm, and electrons not more than 10m. The exact range depends on the energy of the particles, but these are the maximum ranges for nuclear reactions. Also, the distances depend on the density of the air, so they travel farther in hot air / at high altitude.
In general, there is a high electric field inside atoms, and the charged particles.</p>

<p>Finally, these two particle types will never reach the aircraft throwing the bomb. Even if they could, they would be stuck in the hull and not do any damage.</p>

<h2>Neutrons</h2>

<p>While alphas and electrons are absorbed on a short range because their charge interacts with the strong fields inside the atoms they are traveling through, neutrons are neutral (really!), which makes them very special. They like to travel through heavy materials like lead, but are easily stopped by plastic or water (one reason for that large swimming pools in nuclear power plants, though swimming usually is prohibited). The reason is that neutrons are like ping pong balls, and lead atoms like basketballs. The basketball will not notice when it's hit by the ping pong ball, while the ping pong ball flies ahead with the same velocity, but different direction. The next hit(s) with other basketballs may put the ping pong ball into its original direction, still with the same speed.<br>
Hydrogen on the other side is a atom as light as the neutron, hence it's like resting ping pong balls. When hit by the neutron, a hydrogen atom is punched back and absorbs a large fraction of the neutrons energy, causing it to slow down. If the hydrogen atom is bound in a molecule, it may be separated from it during this process. That's why plastic is a good shielding material, but nitrogen and oxygen in the air are already too heavy atoms, so air is a bad shielding material.</p>

<p>The metal the aircraft is made of is (nearly) not affected by neutrons. Unfortunately, almost every molecule of the human body contains hydrogen, especially the DNA. While the pilots do not suffer imminent injuries from radiation, this may increase the chance to get cancer. </p>

<p>However, Paul Tibbets, pilot of the Enola Gay (Hiroshima bomb) died in the age of 92.</p>

<p>One fact: ""Neutron bombs"" are nukes optimized to release a gigantic amount of neutrons. When ignited at high altitude, it kills all animals and humans, leaving the infrastructure (and almost all plants) intact. It's good that they are proscribed by all nations.</p>

<h2>Gamma radiation</h2>

<p>Coming to gamma radiation. People are most afraid of it, as it penetrates anything, and you know, the Hulk was created by it. Its nature is that all the photons it's made of have a tiny chance to interact with the atoms they are passing by. A few photons are stopped, the rest go ahead. This is why each centimeter of material reduces the intensity by a certain factor, but you will never shield gamma range completely (mathematically). Typical gamma rays need some 10cm of aluminium to reduce the intensity to 50%, or less than 10cm of lead. So, it will pass the aircraft's hull and also the pilots. Again, it will not influence the aircraft. And because it only reacts here and there with matter, there is a high chance the pilot's body will repair the damages, and the pilot will not turn green.</p>

<h1>Other effects</h1>

<h2>Shock wave</h2>

<p>As said in the other answers, the explosion causes a big shock wave which will definitely shatter and possibly damage the aircraft. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia says about the Tsar bomb</a> that it was released from about 10km altitude and detonated at 4km. Using a parachute, the bomb was slowed down allowing the aircraft to travel 45km after release. Yet, the aircraft fell about 1km when it was overtaken by the shock wave.</p>

<p>Edit: The shock wave travels at the speed of sound, so the faster the aircraft, the farther away it is when it's overtaken by the shock wave, and the lower the intensity is. (And there are supersonic aircrafts... However, the Tsar shock wave traveled around the earth three times)</p>

<h2>Heat</h2>

<p>A nuclear bomb releases a lot of heat. It is said that in Hiroshima, trees 10km away from the explosion caught fire. But the aircraft was farther away and its hull is not only well cooled, but also much less inflammable than a dry tree in the summer. Nevertheless, the ""Tsar-bomber"" was painted with a special heat-reflecting paint according to the Wikipedia article.</p>

<h2>EMP</h2>

<p>Each nuclear bomb also releases a electromagnetic pulse, which can damage wide electric circuits like power grids as well as any semiconductors. However, the hull of an aircraft already provides some protection against this, and the protection can be improved more to make the aircraft EMP-hard. While today's bombers should be immune to EMP due to these protections, I guess the ones which actually have thrown a nuke were immune as they didn't use any semiconductors.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>It turns out that radioactivity is not an issue because not all parts have the range to reach the aircraft, and those which do, have no influence on the aircraft. </p>

<p>The highest thread comes from the shock wave, which definitely damage the aircraft or at least bring it into an odd situation. I don't know what an issue heat is, but the Tsar bomber had some heat reflective painting, and an aircraft usually has a good cooling by its environment. EMP is not an issue as military aircrafts are usually already protected against them.</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>

<p>Of course, radiation damage / effects depend on the time something was exposed to radiation as well as the intensity. So, when I wrote gamma rays will not harm the pilot that much, this already includes a larger distance and thus lower intensity. Near the detonation, the gamma radiation alone would kill you.</p>

<p>Being exposed to radiation does not automatically make an object radioactive itself. Gamma rays do not make anything radioactive, they ionize atoms and may destroy molecules. The particles may be captured by atoms forming new isotopes / elements. This isotopes / elements may be stable, or may not. If not, that atom is radioactive. However, for most materials, this <em>induced radioactivity</em> has a short decay time.</p>

<p>As said, alpha particles are not an issue as shielding against them is easy, they even can not penetrate the skin. Harmless? Body cells are most vulnerable to radiation damage during their separation, and your guts are covered with mucous membrane, where this happens very frequently. Swallow a piece of alpha emitting material, and getting cancer is more likely than just possible.</p>

<p>You see, radiation is a vast topic, and what I wrote about aircrafts and pilots may be correct for them, but not in general. Their main protection is: Distance is the best shielding, the farther away, the better.</p>

"How do pilots detect and respond to windshear while landing and taking off?","7063","","<p>How does wind shear affect aircraft while landing and taking off? How do pilots detect that they are encountering wind shear and what would they have to do to prevent it from turning into a bad situation?</p>
","<p>The most dangerous form of windshear for planes is the microburst. This is a downdraft that after it hits the ground spreads out in all directions. It is dangerous particularly for planes low to the ground (on takeoff and landing)</p>

<p>When a plane coming in for a landing approaches the microburst it will enter a headwind and see and increase of airspeed and lift, the inexperienced and unsuspecting pilot may then reduce engine power to slow down and keep himself aligned. After the plane passes through the burst it will enter a tailwind decreasing lift which may cause the plane to crash into the ground short of the runway. </p>

<p>To prevent crashing the pilot would need to keep power and possibly abort the approach to wait out the burst.</p>

<p>Detecting windshear from the ground is done with doppler radars (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TDWR"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TDWR</a>) and multiple wind sensors (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_level_windshear_alert_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LLWAS</a>) which can detect the changes in wind which will be relayed to pilots in accordance with <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0301.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">regulations (3-1-8)</a>.</p>

"What happened during this foggy landing?","7060","","<p>Several years ago, I was flying from the USA to Buenos Aires. That's a very long flight, and it was overnight for us.  When I woke up it was early in the morning and we were over Argentina.  I don't remember exactly what the plane was, but it was a very large jet. 767 or something like that.</p>

<p>As we got close, the pilot came on the intercom and announced that it was too foggy down below to land, but we still had plenty of fuel reserves left and so he was going to fly in circles for a while and see if the rising sun didn't burn off some of the fog.  After about 15 minutes, he came on again and said that the fog was burning off, and we were about to begin our descent into Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>I was in a window seat, and I looked outside.  We went into a cloud... and never came out.  Literally the first clue I had that we were <em>anywhere near the ground</em> is when I felt the wheels hit the runway.  And to this day I've always wondered what in the world was going on in the cockpit.</p>

<p>I don't care how good the pilot's eyes were; there was zero visibility outside that airplane.  That fog we were in was the metaphorical ""pea soup"", and he could not possibly have landed visually.  But we came down safe, exactly where we were supposed to be, which means he must have made some sort of instrument-guided landing.  But if he was capable of making a perfect instrument landing at that runway all along, why was the fog reducing visibility ever a concern in the first place?</p>

<p>Does anyone here have enough experience to explain what happened that morning?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I don't care how good the pilot's eyes were; there was zero visibility outside that airplane. That fog we were in was the metaphorical ""pea soup"", and he could not possibly have landed visually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you see from a passenger window has little relationship to what the pilot is looking for and can see out his windshield. The pilot is looking for lead-in lights (there's a lot of them) and a sequence flasher that creates the effect of a ball of light starting at the beginning of the lead-in lights and traveling to the runway. In low visibility the tower will typically turn them up to maximum intensity. These lights are very bright, so much so that after catching sight of them I usually asked for them to be turned down. None of this light system is visible from the passenger cabin of a large aircraft save for the fact that you might notice a glow outside as the airplane passes over them when it's dark.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Another thing that the pilot can do if he has the fuel and if the sun is about to set, is to loiter until it gets darker. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway_visual_range"">runway visual range (RVR)</a> will generally increase considerably in the dark.</p>

<p>There are other things at play as well. In patchy and/or blowing fog, what the RVR reads may not accurately reflect what the visibility is anyplace in the runway environment save where the RVR instrumentation is.</p>

<p>Occasionally, local politics can also be a factor. In the 1980s I used to fly into an airport that had as its only air service the commuter airline I was flying for. The local government and chamber of commerce very much wanted to keep that air service. The problem was fog. An unwritten accommodation was reached that took advantage of the rule that once inside the outer marker, you can continue the approach even though the RVR dropped below the minimum required. We knew that if the reported RVR was right at the minimun required when we were cleared for the approach, we might well be told after reporting passing the outer marker that it was a lesser value.</p>

<p>In two years of flying for that commuter, I never failed to land on the first approach at that airport and neither did most of the captains.</p>

<p>I suspect that in today's hypersensitive regulatory environment, this accommodation might not be possible, and I also don't know if the rule is still in force that permits you to continue an approach once inside the outer marker.</p>

<p>Is this actually true? A <a href=""//usmilitary.com/4981/fighter-pilot-air-force-f-22-jet-careers"" rel=""nofollow"">cursory search</a> seems to contradict what he was

<blockquote>
  <p>To become a Jet fighter Navigator, you have to have [...] a vertical standing
  height of between 64 inches (5 foot 4 inches) and 77 inches (6 foot 5 inches)
  tall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would appear his height is within range. Was he told wrong or am I missing
something?</p>
","<p>To become an Air Force pilot, you have to be a commissioned officer, there are few ways you can do that. First you can go through the Air Force Academy, which is probably the most common. Another way is to be in an ROTC program through your college of choice. The last way I know of is to graduate college and join the Air Force through the officer candidate school (OCS).</p>

<p>Regardless of the method you choose, there are certain requirements you must meet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be a U.S. Citizen</li>
<li>Have any 4 year college degree or be within 365 days of attaining it</li>
<li>Minimum 2.5 GPA (although I'd be surprised if they took you that low)</li>
<li>Under the age of 28 by the board convening date</li>
<li><strong>Have a standing height of 64-77 inches and a sitting height of 34-40 inches</strong></li>
<li>Have no history of hay fever, asthma, or allergies after the age of 12</li>
<li>Meet USAF weight and physical conditioning requirements</li>
<li>Normal color vision</li>
<li>Meet refraction, accommodation, and astigmatism requirements</li>
<li>Distance vision cannot exceed 20/20 uncorrected or must be corrected to 20/20 or better</li>
<li>Near vision cannot exceed 20/40 uncorrected or must be corrected to 20/20 or better</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've met those requirements you can then go through the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) and through Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) for your intellectual and physical evaluation. If you pass those tests, you may be selected for the Officer Candidate School (if not joining through ROTC or Academy). </p>

<p>After that you go into undergraduate pilot training (UPT) where you spend a year learning to fly through academic and hands-on training. Depending on how you perform at UPT you will receive a seat assignment. Higher scores are selected for fighter training while lower scores move towards transport aircraft. You can voice your opinion on what you want to fly, but ultimately the decision is driven by the needs of the Air Force at the time you graduate UPT. </p>

<p>After UPT, you will move to Advanced Flight Training (AFT) which is between 6 months and a year long depending on the aircraft you've been assigned. After AFT you'll be assigned a squadron and location.</p>

<p><strong>If you don't meet height requirements</strong></p>

<p>There is a waiver process, although getting a waiver for height requirements is extremely rare (if not completely unheard of). The issue is that the ejection systems are designed for a specific height. This process starts by appealing a medical review board which you are allowed to write a letter to argue your position, <strike>however even with a waiver you would probably not be assigned a fighter aircraft. You would probably be assigned an aircraft that does not have an ejection system like transport or mid-air refueling aircraft. </strike> As <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/users/4215/rhino-driver"">RhinoDriver</a> mentions in the comments, the T6 training aircraft is also equipped with an ejection seat and if you can't fly the trainer, you can't progress on.</p>

<p>The only other alternative to be a US Air Force pilot outside of height requirements is to be an unmanned aircraft pilot. </p>

"Are fighter jet cabins pressurized?","7048","","<p>I heard once that fighter jet cabins are NOT pressurized, but the pilot's suit is, which prevents problems with decompression if the cabin gets shot.</p>

<p>But a military fighter pilot much later told me that the cabin is, in fact, pressurized and that getting shot (the cabin) and the resulting decompression are not that much of a bother, at all.</p>
","<p>Cabins of fighter jets are in fact pressurized, but not same as the passenger airplanes. Cabin pressure in a passenger airplane will increase (almost in a linear fashion) as the airplane climbs. However, fighters keep ambient air pressure to a certain altitude. It maintains this pressure until a certain pressure differential is met, and then cabin altitude increases to maintain this differential.</p>

<p>Therefore at higher altitudes, cabin pressure in a fighter jet is low enough that supplemental oxygen is required for the pilot(s).

"Do you have to explain what your emergency is?","7035","","<p>Story Time:</p>

<p>Let's assume, for the sake of the question, that you were piloting a twin engine plane and the right engine, out of the blue, shuts down. </p>

<p>After realizing it you declare emergency, and explain <strong>very briefly</strong> to the ATC what is your situation at the moment, and after that you start to work out the checklists (<em>I don't know the right order to proceed on a emergency scenario, but i don't think that it's important to this question</em>).</p>

<p>After that you managed well the situation and safely landed the plane.</p>

<p>So here is my question:</p>

<p>At the moment of the emergency you weren't able to explain with details everything that happened to the ATC.</p>

<ul>
<li>According to FAA, is it required to detail/explain (maybe file some kind of official document) your emergency to some kind of authority?</li>
<li>If you do have to file an explanation, what information do you have to supply?</li>
<li>Also what would happen if they ""didn't believe"" that situation was an emergency?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The order is ""Aviate, Navigate, Communicate"".</p>

<p>As a pilot, your first responsibility is to keep the plane flying. After that it is to avoid hitting something or to avoid getting lost. After that comes communication. There are many instances of in-flight emergencies where the pilots never talked to anybody about it, because they were busy flying the plane...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to FAA, is it required to detail/explain (maybe file some kind of official document) your emergency to some kind of authority?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FAA has many procedures on reporting accidents, incidents, and emergencies. Whether or not you report it depends on what the emergency was. If its a very sick passenger, there may be no reporting required. If your control cables failed, you are required to report it. I'll update this answer with the regulations as soon as I find them all. Quick answer is any time you declare an emergency or ""PAN-PAN"", call the FSDO and let them know. Also depending on the nature of the accident/incident, you may be required to <strong>immediately</strong> notify the NTSB. See <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=49:7.1.4.1.12.2.1.1"">CFR 49 830.5</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you do have to file an explanation, what information do you have to supply?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This depends again on the nature of the emergency, and the FSDO/NTSB will ask you for the proper information when you file the report. At the very least they are probably going to want a narrative of what happened, and depending on what took place, you may want to contact your lawyer first. (Note: You may have to contact the NTSB <em>immediately</em> but it doesn't say you need to provide details, just that there was an incident, so the NTSB would be your first call ""I had an incident"", short and sweet, and the lawyer second.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also what would happen if they ""didn't believe"" that situation was an emergency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not ATC's responsibility to determine if you are lying or not. When you as a pilot say ""emergency"" you have their full attention. After you get on the ground and the emergency turns out to be you forgot to call your girlfriend/wife and wanted to get ahead of other traffic, then the FAA will get involved. Until you are on the ground, an emergency is handled as priority, regardless of the reason.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/nyregion/06plane.html?_r=0"">Here you can read a good story about a stupid pilot</a> who abused the ""emergency"" system by landing on a public beach in New York because of an airsick passenger and an engine that was ""running a teensy bit rough"".

<p>I also wonder if in military or professional formations (aerobatic formations) something outside the Very High Frequency (VHF) Aviation Band is used (to provide better quality, e.g. digital communication).</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.monitoringtimes.com/html/mtMilVHF.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> I can see lot of military frequencies, but not telling me what to use for military formation flying.</p>
","<p>For the US, according to <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/aim0401.html#cn8gx1ccDefa"" rel=""noreferrer"">section 4-1-11</a> of the AIM (<em>Designated UNICOM/MULTICOM Frequencies</em>) for private fixed-wing flights you should use 122.75:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Air-to-air communication (private fixed wing aircraft): 122.750</p>
  
  <p>Air-to-air communications (general aviation helicopters): 123.025</p>
  
  <p>Aviation instruction, Glider, Hot Air Balloon (not to be used for
  advisory service): 123.300, 123.500</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what the military does and their tactical comms might even be encrypted anyway, but they frequently use UHF instead of VHF, at least in the US.</p>

<p>Nor do I know what to do if you have two formation flights at the same time, but I guess that in reality it's either an air show with some form of semi-official control and perhaps even NOTAMs, or it's something private and in that case people make their own arrangements, e.g. picking some frequency that doesn't overlap with any nearby assigned frequencies. Using 123.45 is apparently common, but definitely not official.</p>

<p>Non-VHF communications for private flights would be regulated by the FCC, not the FAA, and personally I'm not sure if the benefits would be worth the extra equipment and the risk of confusion, but then again I know nothing about formation flying.</p>

This variety is why the FAA requires flight crew to instruct passengers in the operation of the seat belts.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, why are the belts in airplanes different?  And why are there so many types?<br>
Each belt is good at something different, and each belt has its own set of drawbacks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The automotive style push-button belt is very familiar to infrequent flyers.</strong><br>
Most people who are going to get on a plane have been in a car (they probably rode in one to the airport), so familiarity with automotive-style seatbelts can generally be assumed. This is great when you take someone for a flight who isn't a frequent airline passenger.<br>
The drawback to the automotive belt is it's not as easy for rescuers to operate, and the push-button mechanism can jam - particularly in fires where the plastic shell can melt/fuse (in cars the belts are often cut by rescuers because it's easier/faster than dealing with the button). If your passengers are injured in an emergency and can't operate the belt it may be difficult for you to locate and press the button to assist in evacuation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The ""utility buckle"" flap belt is easy for rescuers &amp; cabin crew to operate.</strong><br>
The exact opposite of the push-button belt's chief drawback: It's really easy for cabin crew or rescurers to find a utility buckle on a belt by feel and yank the flap to release it (try it some time: Buckle someone into an airplane seat, close your eyes, and find/release the buckle. The hardest part is finding the <em>belt</em> if they're wearing bulky clothes). It's also relatively hard to jam a utility buckle, and relatively easy to inspect them to determine if they're damaged.<br>
The drawback to the utility buckle is that not everyone has been on an airplane (or in a <em>really old car</em> that uses them), so they might not be familiar with ""Lift the flap to release the belt"", and in a panic situation it may take them a few seconds to remember what to do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The rotary buckle is unique and kind of awesome for what it's built for.</strong><br>
Rotary buckles make it easy to attach 4 or 5 point restraints, and to release all or part of them quickly.  (The buckle shown in the photos is single-function - turn to release - but dual-function buckles exist where you can press the button in the center of the buckle to release the shoulder straps, or turn the knob to release everything.)<br>
The big drawbacks to rotary buckles are their novelty: On the ground you usually only find them on 5-point racing harnesses, and in the air they're pretty uncommon too (mainly aerobatic aircraft as I mentioned earlier). They're probably the last type of buckle a passenger or rescuer would expect to have to deal with, and particularly with the dual-action buttons they can present a challenge in a panic egress (passengers will hit the button and release the shoulder harnesses, but they're still restrained by the lower portion of the belt - this can cost precious time for them to realize they have to turn the knob).</p></li>

"What could cause uneven fuel levels in a Cessna 172?","6996","","<p>I went for a 1.5 hour flight in a 1977 Cessna 172N, with several takeoffs and landings. I was alone. When I left, I had 18 gallons in each tank. When I arrived back, I had 15 gallons in the left tank, and 10 in the right tank.</p>

<p>Why was there such a disparity? Is this at all dangerous? Why did the right tank have less?</p>
","<p>Consulting your handy POH (or one for a 172N that I Googled up) you'll find the fuel system diagram looks like the one below (click to enlarge - most high-wing gravity-fed fuel systems are similar).<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZOXT.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZOXTm.png"" alt=""Cessna 172N Fuel System""></a></p>

<p>So there are a number of ways you could wind up with uneven fuel burn with this plumbing.<br>
The most common ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>(Uncoordinated) Turns</strong><br>
If you're flying lots of left-hand traffic patterns (or you're making lots of left turns for some other reason) that means your left wing is frequently lower, and gravity favors pulling fuel from the right tank. (Note that it doesn't have to be a turn - prolonged slips can also cause uneven fuel flow.)<br>
<em>If I had to take a guess, I'd say this is probably your culprit. Were you making a lot of left turns?</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pressure</strong><br>
The fuel vent tube on the left tank faces into the wind - this pressurizes the left tank first (and the right tank through the breather tube connecting the two) - it's a little extra encouragement for fuel to leave the tanks and flow into the engine. In some aircraft this leads to the left tank draining faster (because it's at a slightly higher air pressure than the right tank) - this can become particularly pronounced if the breather tube between the two tanks is blocked.<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Z9E0.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Z9E0m.jpg"" alt=""Cessna fuel vent""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Various blockages</strong><br>
A partial blockage in either of the tank fuel lines, the fuel selector valve, the vent, or the breather line between the two tanks could theoretically cause uneven fuel burn (the vent/breather blockages being a special case of ""pressure"" from (2) above).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pilot Error</strong><br>
It's possible to mis-position the fuel selector in such a way that you're getting adequate fuel flow to run the engine, but one tank is more restricted than the other.<br>
This is unlikely if the aircraft is properly maintained (the fuel selector should have nice, identifiable detents that it clicks into, letting you know it's in position).</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Is uneven fuel burn dangerous? Maybe.<br>
It's certainly something you should be aware of (part of why you want your fuel gauges to be at least <em>somewhat</em> accurate is so you can tell if your fuel burn is uneven in flight and correct it by switching to the fuller tank briefly).  </p>

<p>Uneven fuel burn can be an annoyance (a 5 gallon difference is about 30lbs - potentially enough to notice on the controls), but it can also be a safety hazard: If allowed to go uncorrected you could theoretically get yourself into a situation where the right fuel tank is empty, and in a steep enough left turn you may not have enough pressure from gravity to get fuel from the left tank into the engine.  </p>

<p>In an extreme case your right tank may be empty and your left tank may be so low as to unport the fuel pickup tube in a turn, potentially leading to attitude-induced fuel starvation (""The noisy part of the plane gets quiet until you level the wings""). </p>

"Why are commercial airplanes painted at all?","6993","","<p>While there was debate over why <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2354/why-are-planes-generally-painted-white"">airplanes  are painted white</a> and a question about <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/13738/how-much-does-it-cost-to-give-an-airliner-a-fresh-coat-of-paint"">how much a new paint job costed</a>, what hasn't been asked is why airplanes are painted at all.</p>

<p>I remember one airline company sent out a press release in the 1980s or 1990s that keeping its planes unpainted (i.e, a nice silver) saved several hundred gallons of paint as well as considerable cost savings because the plane was also lighter and used less fuel.</p>

<p>If there are considerable positives to keeping planes unpainted, why do airline companies bother painting them? </p>

<p>This is prompted by a recent flight I had on an US Air airplane that had just been repainted in the American Airlines livery. The captain joked that the paint was still so new that we shouldn't try touching it. Both companies are famous for always being in severe debt -- so saving every penny should have meant going for the 'naked' look.</p>

<p><strong>Related:</strong> A <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-much-fuel-would-we-save-globally-if-all-airlines-stripped-the-paint-off-their-planes-and-brought-it-down-to-a-sheen"" rel=""noreferrer"">quora question</a> on how much money would be saved if airlines stopped painting their liveries and a <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_05/textonly/fo01txt.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boeing white paper on painted vs unpainted</a></p>
","<p>I remembered hearing that paint actually reduces the drag of the plane. Searching a bit I found <a href=""http://flightshield.com/docs/Boeing%20Report.pdf"">this Boeing document </a> describing it.</p>

<p>So the painting reduces the fuel costs, instead of increasing them. Another interesting thing is, that planes are regularly repainted to keep the drag low. Of course there is the <em>billboard</em> effect too.</p>

<p>From the report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In response to numerous questions raised by 
  Boeing customers regarding the efficacy of 
  surface coatings to reduce drag, Boeing has
  investigated some possible airflow physics 
  explanations. Possible explanations postulated by Boeing aerodynamicists include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Increased regions of laminar flow due to reduced surface roughness.</li>
  <li>Reduction in surface roughness resulting in lower skin friction drag, when flow is turbulent.</li>
  <li>Reduction in dirt and/or insect adhesion resulting in reduced roughness and hence reduced skin friction drag.</li>

"What is vortex lift?","6976","","<p>In a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21063/what-advantages-come-with-the-wing-on-the-boeing-bird-of-prey"">recent question</a> I asked, I was given an answer by <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/users/1961/peter-k%C3%A4mpf"">Peter Kämpf</a> and he described something about lift being created by a vortex used on delta wings and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Bird_of_Prey"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bird of Prey</a> wing.</p>

<p>How exactly does vortex lift form to generate lift and on what other types of wing is it used on?</p>
","<p>The vortex lift is the method by which highly swept wings (like delta wings) produce lift at high angles of attack.</p>

<p>In the case of wings having sharp, highly swept leading edges like delta wings, the leading-edge separation vortex phenomenon occurs at subsonic speeds. However, the separation does not destroy the lift as in the case of low sweep wings; instead, it forms two vortices which are (nearly) parallel to the wing edges.</p>

<p>In case of Concorde, the vortices look like this:</p>

<p>Vortices over the Concorde wing, <em>Separation in three-dimensional steady flow</em>, ONERA</p>

<p>A cross-section of the vortices looks like this:</p>

<p>Flow above the Concorde Wing, <em>Separation in three-dimensional steady flow</em>, ONERA</p>

<p>Unlike the (bound) vortex of the conventional wing, these are real in the sense that they represent an actual mass of air rotating at high speed compared to the air in front of the wing.</p>

<p>The vortices form 'vortex sheets' along the wing. Air is sucked into the vortex sheets and accelerated downward. As the airspeed in the vortex is high, the pressure is low. This low presssure on the upper surface produces lift.</p>

<p>From <em>Low Aspect Ratio Wings at High Angles of Attack</em> at adg.stanford.edu:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the leading edge vortices, increase the wing lift in a nonlinear manner. The vortex can be viewed as reducing the upper surface pressures by inducing higher velocities on the upper surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/auIYi.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/auIYi.gif"" alt=""Lift due to Vortices""></a></p>

<p>Source: adg.stanford.edu</p>

<p>Basically, the vortices increase the lift from the baseline (potential flow) values, with the extra force being equal to the loss of leading edge suction associated with the separated flow in high angle of attack highly swept wings. This analogy gives the same result as before.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvqSa.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvqSa.png"" alt=""Vortex lift in delta wings""></a></p>

<p><em>A Concept of the Vortex Lift of Sharp-Edge Delta Wings based on a Leading-Edge suction Analogy</em>, Edward C. Polhamus, NASA Technical note D-3767</p>

<p>A major advantage of vortex lift generation is that it is effective at high angles of attack, over which the wings would normally stall. Actually, that Concorde used this method of lift generation is the reason for the high AoA during landing and its droop down nose.</p>

<p>One thing to be noted is that vortex lift generation happens at high angles of attack or in case the wings are designed to generate separated flow (with sharp edges as in Concorde) in normal conditions. Otherwise the lift generation is by conventional means. </p>

"What is the ratio between time in the air and time on ground for an aircraft?","6974","","<p>I suppose it may be different from an airline to another.
Given the maintenance, the time to load/unload the aircraft, the time the aircraft is grounded because there is no flight scheduled (e.g. at night), how many time an aircraft actually spend on ground compared to the time it spend in the air?</p>
","<p>It will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft, but I will try to give some general estimates.</p>

<h1>Time on the Ground</h1>

<p>Part of what you are referring to what is sometimes called <em><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=aircraft%20turn%20time&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aircraft turn time</a></em>. It's not really directly related to my calculations for your overall question (though it is certainly a factor for short-haul jets), but in <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_01/textonly/t01txt.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, minimum turn times for the Boeing 757 was studied, and it was found that the estimated turn time for a 757-200 was 52.5 minutes, based on actual operations. The 757-300, a stretched model with more seating, would take about 59 minutes.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CFoQFjAH&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.agifors.org%2Fdocument.go%3FdocumentId%3D1666%26action%3Ddownload&amp;ei=AQAvVISzKYiwyATthIG4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfuKQ43AFcwiYhX_xon6UVH1JfOg&amp;sig2=SY_cLF-qhNFQkgdiWKdFhw&amp;bvm=bv.76802529,d.aWw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this presentation</a>, presented by United Airlines, they show a general guideline MSGT (Minimum Scheduled Ground Time), that is a generalization depending on flight locations, field facilities, and airlines. Some times are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boeing 747: 80 minutes</li>
<li>Boeing 777: 70 minutes</li>
<li>Boeing 767: 60 minutes (-300 model)</li>
<li>Boeing 737: 35 minutes (-300 model)</li>
<li>Airbus A320: 40 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/1567507/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This link</a> has a discussion of a number of airliner turn times, however none are from official sources. Most vary between 20-45 minutes, depending on if cleaning is required.</p>

<p><strong>So for a typical airliner we can say it takes about 45 minutes-1 hour for a typical servicing.</strong></p>

<h1>Aircraft Lifetime</h1>

<p>Now as to how many times they fly, you can find their aircraft design cycle limit (essentially, how many takeoffs and landings it can make in its lifetime) in <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-11-15/html/2010-28363.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Federal Register document</a> (summarized <a href=""http://www.airwaysim.com/forum/index.php?topic=30738.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). Some listed numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boeing 747: 20,000 cycles</li>
<li>Boeing 777: 40,000 cycles</li>
<li>Boeing 767: 50,000 cycles</li>
<li>Airbus A320: 48,000 cycles (60,000 hours)</li>
<li>Airbus A300: 40,000 cycles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So for a 'typical' airliner we can say it can survive about 40,000 cycles in a lifetime</strong></p>

<p>You can find the average age of airliners in different places online. <a href=""http://www.airsafe.com/events/airlines/fleetage.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> splits up by airline and aircraft, and most airliners have an average age of 12-15 years. But note that this is the <em>active fleet</em>. <strong>The average age at retirement for an airliner is now <a href=""http://aviationweek.com/awin/aircraft-retirement-age-drops-again"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">around 24-25 years</a>.</strong></p>

<p><em>You can find a related Aviation.SE question <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2263/what-is-the-lifespan-of-commercial-airframes-in-general"">here</a></em></p>

<h1>Aircraft Usage</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/492074/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This thread</a> discusses the average cycles and flight hours per day. Long haul aircraft (like the 747, 777, A380) tend to spend more hours in the air per flight, but also have less cycles per day. I can't find official sources, but the thread presents a couple example averages for peak usage rate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delta Boeing 757: 9.5 hours/4.8 cycles</li>
<li>United Boeing 747: 13.2 hours/1.6 cycles</li>
</ul>

<p>(I find these probably accurate, as there have been some publicized accidents that have much higher usage, like <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/faa-southwest-plane-torn-fuselage-average-7-flights-a-day.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>, which flew 48,740 hours and 39,781 cycles in 15 years - about 7 flights/day; short-haul jets like the one in the article end up with more cycles than long-haul, as I noted above).</p>

<p>It is difficult to find hard numbers, but overall, <strong>the average flight length for a short-haul jet is about 2 hours, whereas a long-haul jetliner is around 6-7 hours.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>Again, there are a lot of variables in this question, but using the above data, we can estimate the answer to your question, using these estimated figures from above:</p>

<ul>
<li>40,000 cycles (~20,000 flights)</li>
<li>25 years</li>
<li>2 hours/flight</li>
</ul>

<p>This means approximately 40,000 flight hours for a typical short-haul jet; over 25 years (219,000 hours), this works out to about 1 hour in flight for every 5 on the ground. Obviously this varies widely, but for a ballpark number, that's the best I can do. The highest usage would be a heavily used long-haul jet used on the longest routes from a busy airline (i.e. trans-Pacific; Middle East to U.S.), whereas the lowest would be a moderate-length flight on a low-volume route. <strong>In general, you are probably looking at about 1:3 to 1:5 air:ground time</strong>.</p>

"Why do we use pylons to mount the engines on jetliners?","6971","","<p>This question focus on jet airliners.</p>

It seems jet airliners' engines are now mounted on pylon. That assumption goes wherever the engine is mounted (<a href=""http://www.airliners.net/photo/Swiss-International-Air/Airbus-A330-343/1899910"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">underwing</a> or at the <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aLP-tJxG13U/TUoWPItOihI/AAAAAAAAACY/tg7FM7qgtSQ/s1600/MD90+Pylon+Flaps+1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rear</a> of the aircraft).</p>

<p>What are the advantages of doing so (aerodynamic, maintenance, safety,...)? Is there some drawback (must be minimal as this design is dominant)?</p>

<p>Note: I don't want discussion about <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9680/why-not-mount-airliner-jet-engines-above-the-wings"">where to mount engine</a> (underwing as for the B747, overwing as for the VFW-Fokker 614, at the rear as for the MD-80, ...), I'm curious about why we use pylons for all this designs.</p>
","<p>Engine placement was a tricky question when jets were introduced, and much has been learned since then. The initial idea was to mount them inside the fuselage or wing root. When they grew too big, they were closely mounted to the wing (""underslung"" position, like in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262"">Me-262</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-28"">Il-28</a> or the early <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#737_Original_series"">Boeing 737</a>).</p>

<p>However, the underslung position has two disadvantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>More of the leading and trailing edges is obstructed, blocking space that would otherwise be used for slats and flaps. Consequently, an underslung position reduces maximum lift.</li>
<li>The center of gravity of the engine is too far back. Moving it more forward helps to place the center of gravity of the wing ahead of its elastic line. Bending will now create an opposing inertial moment, which is very helpful to dampen flutter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting to move the engine downwards away from the wing initially increases drag, because now a narrow slot opens between both with a tendency to separated flow. Only when the engine is moved downwards enough, the drag of the wing-engine arrangement reaches its minimum. This placement was chosen in the next generation of jets like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress"">B-52</a> or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707"">Boeing 707</a>.</p>

<p>Moving it still further down makes the pylon longer and thus increases the total drag again.</p>

<p>The big diameters of modern high-bypass ratio engines make it impractical to move it down enough to reach the drag minimum, but by moving it forward, the engine can again be lifted up, so a shorter landing gear becomes possible. Vortex generators are added if that pesky separation between engine and nacelle cannot be avoided.</p>

"What is some of this extra ""stuff"" on jet engines?","6967","","<p>At the risk of sounding too broad, I want to better understand the complications of jet engines. This time, I'm asking about extra ""stuff"", which unfortunately I have no better name for since I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with the basic cycle of jets. Compressor stages draw in air and pressurize it, combustion heats and expands the air, and turbine stages extract some torque from the jet to drive the engine.</p>

<p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Turbofan_operation.svg/320px-Turbofan_operation.svg.png""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Turbofan_operation.svg/320px-Turbofan_operation.svg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It's a modern turbofan. What is all that extra stuff? Can it really all be fuel and air lines? I'm especially scratching my head because the basic design has only a handful of moving parts (the stages/blades) all driven by the turbine and its shaft, so I can't imagine those are mostly hydraulic or electric lines either.</p>

<p>I found a simpler example here (Tumansky RD-10):</p>

<p>It is a turbojet and much older.</p>
","<p>Of course the basic concept of a turbine engine is relatively simple, but the devil is in the details. To make an engine efficient, reliable, powerful, and safe, a lot more components are needed.</p>

<p><strong>Fuel</strong>. Obviously an engine needs fuel to operate. The fuel is burned in combustors located around the circumference of the engine. This requires separate fuel lines to each of the combustors around this section of the engine. The fuel must be connected to the main fuel supply, and to the throttle/engine controls to meter the fuel flow.</p>

<p><strong>Oil</strong>. All the rotating machinery inside of a turbine means that oil is needed to keep everything moving smoothly. There is an oil tank, and tubes to move it to where it is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Main bleed air</strong>. Bleed air is taken from certain sections of the engine. This serves the air conditioning and anti-ice system and can be used to start other engines. This bleed air is taken from multiple places around the circumference, and from multiple stages provide the required pressures at different engine speeds.</p>

<p><strong>Other bleed air</strong>. The basic design of a turbine engine has air entering the front and leaving the back. However, in a real engine, a lot more movement of air is going on. Engines have to operate in a huge range of conditions. Sometimes air needs to be bled from a certain section to manage the pressures and maintain stable operation. Sections of the turbine are also cooled by bleed air. It takes more tubing to move all this air around.</p>

<p><strong>Sensors</strong>. Modern engines measure a lot of information to remain stable and efficient. This includes temperatures and pressures at multiple places all along the engine, as well as fire detectors and the speeds of the different rotors. These are all hooked back to the engine controls.</p>

<p><strong>Generator</strong>. This is connected to one of the engine spools, and provides power to the aircraft, including all of the electronics on the engine itself.</p>

<p><strong>Starter</strong>. Usually separate from the generator, also connected to an engine spool. This uses bleed air to turn the rotors in order to start the engine.</p>

<p><strong>Control</strong>. Usually on the outside of the fan case (at the front of the engine, left side of the RR image in the question), modern engines run with a lot of electronics, referred to as Engine Electronic Control (EEC) or Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). All of the items above require wiring for control and feedback. Each tube will need different valves, connected back to the electronics, to control the operation. Liquids will need pumps and filters. There are also additional movable components inside the engine that can be adjusted by the engine control system.</p>

","<p>With a few exceptions (modern aircraft engines with FADEC systems) a ""Check Engine"" light on an aircraft would be essentially useless.</p>

<p>In a modern car we have an Engine Control Unit which manages things like mixture and engine timing. The ""Check Engine"" lamp illuminates when the ECU has detected a fault that requires some sort of attention, but it's not usually specific as to what the fault is or how urgent the problem is.</p>

<p>In most light GA aircraft (like the Cessna or Cirrus in your question) the engines are straight out of the 1950s/1960s: There are no computers managing the engine for you, and the <em>pilot</em> is acting as the ECU.<br>
The pilot should be checking the engine's health regularly (by looking at the engine gauges) and adjusting power, mixture, and propeller pitch as required.</p>

<p>Since there is no computer supervising the operation of the engine in most light GA aircraft there's no system to determine when the light should be on, so there is no ""Check Engine"" light.</p>

<p>Note that some light aircraft do incorporate warning lights for system status information. For example, the status cluster on newer Piper Warriors:<br>

Bottom row: Not used on this aircraft.</p>

<p>The information provided by these lights is more specific than simply ""Check Engine"" - directing the pilot's attention to a specific system or condition. The lights are also not a substitute for regularly scanning the engine instruments and managing the powerplant, they're merely a supplement to catch your attention between scans.</p>

","<p>Helicopters are very inefficient in forward flight, for several reasons.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Consider Glauert's high speed assumption, i.e. the helicopter can be represented as an aircraft with a circular wing during high speed flight.  Now, if you know anything about basic fixed-wing performance, you'll realize immediately that this implies an aspect ratio just over 1, which is awfully small.  You may recall that for a fixed-wing aircraft, induced drag is inversely proportional aspect ratio--so a very low aspect ratio means very high induced drag!  Induced drag is normally not a big deal for fixed-wing aircraft at high speed because it's proportional to the square of the lift coefficient (which decreases with speed), but...</li>
<li>In reality, the situation for a helicopter is even worse!  Glauert's assumption assumes we have an ideal rotor, i.e. one that has a uniform induced velocity throughout.  In practice, the inflow distribution over the rotor is highly non-uniform, especially at high speeds where the advancing side of the rotor is in a very different aerodynamic environment than the retreating side.  Even on a very simple level, the ""working area"" swept on the retreating side is much smaller than that on the advancing side. Since lift needs to be balanced, momentum theory implies a higher induced velocity over the smaller area ""worked"" by the retreating side, and therefore a much higher induced drag at high speeds than an equivalent fixed wing aircraft.

<a href=""http://www.mentor.com/products/mechanical/engineering-edge/volume4/issue1/helicopter-rotator-simulation"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rotor wake computation from TsAGI RC-VTOL code (Kritsky, B.S).</a></li>
<li>As the helicopter goes faster, and as the rotor turns more slowly, more of the retreating side blade will stall, which leads to a dramatic increase in drag. This starts on the inboard section of the blades, and moves outwards as the advance ratio (ratio between flight speed and tip speed) increases.  In fact, the most inboard sections of the blade will even be in reversed flow--and airfoils don't work too well backwards.</li>
<li>On the advancing side, things are bad too, but for different reasons. The profile drag of the rotor increases rapidly with speed.  Moreover, as the advance ratio increases, the advancing tip Mach number also increases--and as the blades get into the high transonic regime, local shocks begin to form and lead to even larger increases in drag.  This can be delayed by slowing the rotor down, but that makes the problems on the retreating side even worse!  In general, it's hard to develop airfoils that work well in both regimes.</li>
<li>Outside of the rotor itself, the rotor hub is very draggy, between the main rotor shaft, pitch links, swashplate, hinges and blade grips, etc.  Helicopters usually have pretty ""utilitarian"" fuselages, as well, which are not so well streamlined.  Plus, you have the tail rotor, which has most of the same problems as the main rotor.</li>
<li>Back to the specific question of range, the Bregruet range equation says that the range of an aircraft is proportional to the lift-to-drag ratio and the speed of the aircraft.  We've already established that the L/D of a helicopter is pretty bad, especially at speed.  So, the cruise speed is going to be pretty low and the L/D is going to be pretty low, so to sum up, the range is going to be really low.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tradeoff is that the helicopter is very good at hovering--even amongst VTOL platforms, the helicopter is the most efficient. Speed and range are the price you pay for that capability.</p>

"How often should an engine be run, to stay mechanically sound?","6905","","<p>It's winter time and many light aircraft are sitting idle. This can be detrimental to an engine's health.</p>

<p>What is a good rule of thumb for how often a piston engine should be exercised, and for how long?</p>

<p>If the aircraft cannot be flown, what is an acceptable alternative?</p>
","<p>All your plane's systems are happier when you're flying, including the pilot.</p>

<p>Ideally you'd fly often in order to keep your engine happy (distributing clean oil throughout the system to protect against corrosion, and heating it enough to drive off water from the crank case).<br>
As a rule of thumb <a href=""http://www.blackstone-labs.com/Newsletters/Aircraft/July-1-2013.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blackstone Labs (the oil analysis folks) consider piston engines ""inactive"" if they've had less than about 5 hour of flight time per month</a>. Their threshold <em>used to be</em> 10 hours, so I personally try to fly at least 10 hours a month much when practical, but 5 at a minimum.<br>
Blackstone has a LOT of data on aircraft engine wear patterns accumulated, and I generally trust their insight in this regard (after all they're not trying to sell me an engine, just asking me to pay them to play with my used oil).</p>

<p>When weather or other factors mean you can't fly enough to keep your engine ""active"" you can preserve it in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, but let's be honest, most of us aren't going to ""pickle"" our engines for the winter. It's a LOT of work, and it means you <em>can't go fly</em> on those nice winter days we sometimes get.  </p>

<p>In situations like this it may be beneficial to ground-run your engine (say at least on a monthly basis) just to keep things lubricated and happy. Ground runs at a little below runup power or a fast idle are usually the order of the day here. Taxiing around is also probably a good idea, if practical, to keep your wheel bearings and related components moving -- maybe take your plane down to the runup pad and back.</p>

<hr>

<p>When doing the ground run you want to observe a few guidelines to make sure what you're doing is actually <em>beneficial</em> to the engine:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Make sure you've got clean oil in the plane!</strong><br>
Any time you think the plane is going to be inactive you want to have good, clean oil in the engine (and you want to have done a thorough ground run or flight to spread that clean oil everywhere). This gives you optimal protection against corrosion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treat it like a flight.</strong><br>
Preflight the plane like you're taking it up, even if you're not.  You may not be flying much because of the weather, so there's a real chance your plane's systems will be in less-than-excellent shape. That thorough walk-around may catch a potentially expensive problem before it becomes a real issue.  </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/347/when-is-pre-heating-a-piston-engine-important-and-how-do-i-do-the-pre-heat-righ""><strong>Preheat if necessary.</strong></a><br>
Hand-in-hand with treating it like a real flight, you want to make sure you're not abusing your engine in the name of protecting it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get the engine oil to normal operating temperature.</strong><br>
Part of the point of the ground run is to drive off water that has condensed in your oil -- oil is good for metal parts, and water is bad for them.<br>
If you don't get the engine oil up to normal middle-of-the-green-arc temperatures and keep it there for a good while (20-30 minutes at least) you may not be driving out the water, which can lead to a very unhappy engine.<br>
<strong><em>If you don't get the oil up to operating temperature long enough you may wind up doing more harm than good!</em></strong> Combustion blow-by leaking around the piston rings contains water (and a bunch of other corrosive things your engine doesn't like), and really short ground runs that don't bring the engine to temperature are mainly just causing wear from the startup and dumping these nasty things into your oil. Your engine is not going to like that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run long enough to recharge your battery.</strong><br>
Watch your ammeter / load meter after startup, and make sure that your battery has been replenished before you shut down.<br>
This means running your engine at a high enough RPM that the charging system can charge the battery (a fast idle is usually fine), and long enough that the battery can be charged (which isn't a problem, because if you were paying attention to #4 you've noticed we'll be running the engine a good while anyway).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitor your cylinder head temperatures.</strong><br>
If equipped with CHT probes, make sure you're not exceeding the CHT limits for your engine during the ground runs.  This goes hand in hand with #7 below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lean your mixture to avoid fouling your plugs.</strong><br>
You should be using less than 65% of your engine's max rated power for these ground runs -- in fact you should <em>probably</em> be somewhere around 50-60%.  Rather than running full rich, pull back on the red knob and let the engine burn cleaner (but keep an eye out for the warning signs of detonation/preignition).<br>
You probably only want to do this if you've got Cylinder Head Temperature readouts you trust -- when in doubt you can always run full rich (for the added cylinder cooling) and just clean your plugs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the outside air temperature your ground run may last anywhere from 30 minute to 90 minutes (I've not personally had one last longer than that, though it's theoretically possible I suppose) -- it all depends on how long #4 and #5 above take.</p>

<hr>

<p>A final thought: I use ASL CamGuard in my oil. It goes in with every oil change.  <a href=""http://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/pdf/ASL_NEWSLETTER_vol_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mike Busch (a smarter guy than me) swears by it</a>, and there seems to be ample real-world-anecdotal evidence as well as a good amount of actual materials testing research that indicates it's a pretty decent corrosion inhibitor.<br>
I've not had my plane/engine long enough to know if this treatment is effective or not, but it certainly doesn't seem to be <em>hurting</em> anything, and while it's a little expensive it's not ""liquid gold"" prices, so it strikes me as cheap enough insurance that you may as well dump it in the sump. This is especially true when you weigh it against the price of a bottom-end overhaul because you got pitted cam lobes or lifters...</p>

"How does a flying wing keep from going into a flat spin when maneuvering?","6881","","<p>How do flying wings, like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit"">B-2 Stealth</a> bomber, actually keep themselves from yawing out of control without a vertical stabilizer?</p>

<p>For the record, I assume this has to be a simple mechanics process.  Why?  Well flying wings go all the way back to the 30s.  One of the earliest (and my personal favorite) is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_N-9M"">N-9M</a>, which was a scale model of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_XB-35"">XB-35</a>, a prototype bomber for the allies during WWII.</p>

<p>They didn't have flight control computers back then, and the only control complaints I recall them having is that early versions had a tendency to flip over backwards when approaching stall speeds, well, that and the ground effects were pretty strong. But, no mentions of going into flat spins when going into hard maneuvers (that I recall).</p>

<p>So how do they control that Y axis on flying wings?  Are they perhaps more susceptible to a flat spin than a regular design (even if those risks can be kept to an acceptable minimum)?</p>
","<p>Theres two different approaches, passive and active stability on all three axis.</p>

<p>X axis (roll):</p>

<p>In the X axis, flying wings are stabilized the same as any other plane.
Passive stability is achieved through a slight upwards dihedral between left and right wing. As such the ""lower"" wing creates slightly more lift in upwards direction and allows the plane to roll back to horizontal flight.
Active stability is achieved through ailerons near the wing tips which create a controlled differential lift allowing the pilot or flight computer to control the roll velocity.</p>

<p>Y axis (pitch)
Passive stability in the Y axis in traditional planes is achieved through the high-leverage corrective force of the horizontal stabilizer (with the exception of canard type planes where the main wing itself takes this role)
Active stability is achieved through elevator controls on this stabilizer, which increase or decrease the vertical force in one or the other direction.</p>

<p>In a flying wing this stabilizer is not present. Instead the rearward area of the main wing takes this role. For this to work, a stable flying wing needs to have wings that are significantly swept backwards in such a way that the overall torque force at both positive and negative high angle of attack is always decreasing this angle of attack.
Active stability is achieved through control surfaces at the very back of the wing. These are often the same control surfaces also used for Roll control, but deflecting in unison instead of opposite directions (Elevons)</p>

<p>Z Axis (yaw)
Similar to pitch, the passive and active yaw control on conventional planes is done with a stabilizer fin with a rudder at the tail.</p>

<p>In true flying wings this is not present (Some don't even have winglets) But the high wing sweep (usually the wings of a  flying wings meet at roughly 90° angle at the tip) causes a higher drag force at the forward facing wing if the craft yaws to one side, which enacts the required corrective force.
Active control is achieved by causing additional drag through some sort of braking flaps near the wing tips (the actual implementations vary - split elevons - separate break flaps - ...) This can also be augmented by using differential thrust.
(Note: The corrective force is much lower than that caused by a tail fin. As such a powered flying wing should have its engines relatively close to the center, otherwise a one-engine-out scenario would cause an uncorrectable yawing moment. This however limits the effectiveness of differential thrust if the craft is supposed to stay flyable in such a condition)</p>

<p>Speed and stall stability:
A speed stable plane has its nose pitch up at higher speeds and pitch down if the craft gets slower, thanks to the center of gravity being in front of the center of lift, which causes the nose to drop. This is balanced out by a (usually parasitic) downward force from the horizontal stabilizer acting at the tail of the plane. This arrangement of forces should also cause the nose to drop and the angle of attack to reduce in a stall situation.</p>

<p>As a flying wing does not have this stabilizer, a similar balance of forces needs to be achieved through a careful design of wing profile and twist.
If you look at Horton flying wing glider designs for example, they have a ""thick"" profile creating the majority of lift in the center (which thanks to the wing sweep is also the front)  Towards the end and back of the wings, the profile becomes thinner and more symmetric. At the same time, the wings are slightly twisted, so the intrinsic angle of attack is a few degree lower at the tip (and as such at the rear of the wing) than near the nose.
At high speeds, the front of the wing creates more lift than the back and rises the nose. This part has the highest wing load and will stall first, while the swept back outer wing area - thanks to its profile, lower AoA and lower load will not have stalled yet. The nose drops, and the control surfaces in this rearward part stay functional.</p>

<p>It should be noted that not all flying wing designs did achieve a safe stall behavior. Some, like early 1940's and 1950's American designs failed to implement stall stability correctly, while others (like the B2 bomber) the plane was deliberately designed aerodynamically unsafe to faciliate other features (stealth) which would have been compromised by a ""twisted"" wing.</p>

"How does a helicopter pilot execute an auto-rotation landing?","6878","","<p>What are the critical steps a pilot follows to perform an auto-rotation landing?</p>
","<p>I am going to assume that by ""critical"", you mean survivable.  I will also assume that the engine failure occurs at a height which will kill you.</p>

<p>It's not so much critical steps, it's critical outcomes.  The single most critical outcome is to preserve, or regain, rotor RPM.  What steps are needed to do this will depend on what the aircraft is doing when the engine quits and, to a lesser extent, the type of the helicopter.  I will generalise for an ""average"" helicopter in straight and level flight.</p>

<p>The immediate action that is drilled into everyone from the very earliest hours as a student is to lower the collective.  Doing this has three effects.  It removes the positive pitch from the blades which removes most of the drag, it aligns the rotor thrust vector with the axis of rotor rotation therefore not using rotor energy for anything except lift and it causes a clutch to disengage the rotor from the engine allowing it to freewheel.  From this point onwards, you are heading back towards earth.</p>

<p>The second immediate action at the same time as lowering the collective (assuming forward flight) is to pull back on the cyclic to flare.  This loads the disc which causes it to ""cone"" upwards which reduces the disc diameter.  Therefore, the centre of gravity of the disc moves inwards and due to conservation of angular momentum, the rotor RPM increases.  For quite complex reasons, the nose of the helicopter will also pitch down when the collective is lowered so pulling back counters that tendency.</p>

<p>The third immediate action is to push in the pedal on the opposite side to the rotation of the blades. If the blades rotate counter clockwise (to the left as the pilot sees it) you push in right pedal to reduce the thrust which is produced by the tail rotor which is no longer countering the yaw caused by the drag from the powered rotor.  This is less critical than the first two and although it can be dangerous and get you into an uncomfortable attitude, it is usually possible to recover from not pushing the pedal in immediately.  If you've got rotor RPM, then you can sort it out.</p>

<p>Now you have successfully entered autorotation.  From here, fly more or less normally to the next critical point which is about 50' off the ground.  </p>

<p>What you've done is to ensure that the rotor has flying RPM and that you are managing energy by trading potential energy (height) for kinetic energy (rotor RPM).  The conversion is done by the airflow which now comes from under the disc and ""drives"" the rotor to maintain RPM.  The pitch is neutral, or maybe even negative but, the relative airflow is now <strong>upwards</strong> through the disc and therefore, the blades have a positive angle of attack and generate some lift.  This stops the helicopter from falling.  There is some drag generated as a consequence of generating that lift, but it is easily overcome by the power which is now driving the rotor from that upward airflow.</p>

<p>As long as you are descending, that conversion will happen and your RPM will be maintained.  The controls are rigged such that with the collective fully down, RPM will remain in the normal range.  Sometimes you have to tweak it a little with small amounts of collective, flares and turns but in general, you just fly towards your landing spot.  The allowed RPM range is greater in autorotation.  For example (and from memory), the R22 has a range of 97-103% in normal flight and 90-110% in autorotation.</p>

<p>You are now descending with a high rate of descent and usually, significant forward speed.  You need to reduce both of those to get to a safe arrival. To do this, there are three more critical steps.</p>

<p>Starting at about 50 feet (depending on lots of factors but let's stick with the average helicopter which entered autorotation from straight and level with significant altitude), you flare the aircraft by pulling back on the cyclic.  This will immediately begin to slow the aircraft.  It will also begin to increase RPM (you are now converting speed into rotor kinetic energy).  </p>

<p>At the same time, you increase collective to reduce the rate of descent by increasing the lift generated.  This will rapidly increase the drag, but now the energy needed to maintain the RPM is coming from the flare which is converting speed into RPM.  You also need to put in pedal to stop the aircraft from yawing as the drag increases on the rotor.</p>

<p>Providing you get the entry right and your flare reduces the speed and rate of descent to something survivable, then you will walk away.  You might wreck the helicopter and break some bones, but arrive at 10 feet with only 20 knots and 150 feet per minute rate and you'll get away with it.</p>

<p>If you are well trained and in practice, then you will land safely and smoothly with no damage to  machine or people.</p>

<p>In summary, critical steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Entry.  Lever down, cyclic back, pedal in. </p>
  
  <p>Arrival.  Cyclic back, lever up, pedal in.</p>

"Will air traffic control ever ask a plane to not brake hard on a landing?","6871","","<p>In <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/39009/does-the-avoidance-of-thrust-reverser-save-fuel"">another question</a>, somebody asked why an airplane might not deploy thrust reversers on a landing. One of the answers suggested a few options, including:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending where the gate was, they may simply have wanted use more of the runway to speed up the taxi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It occurred to me that it's not just a matter of a pilot wanting to get to the gate sooner; it could be that ground control wants them to take that last exit (for whatever reason), but air traffic control wants them off the runway quickly so that they can use it for another airplane.</p>

<p>I assume the final decision of how to conduct the landing is the pilot's. But will air traffic control ever ask nicely, ""you're going to be taking the last exit, but please don't do the final bit of braking until the end, because we'd like to get another flight taking off right after you land""?</p>
","<p>Yes, we can ask you to plan your landing roll in a certain way. We won't technically instruct you to brake the aircraft in a specific way, but simply to aim for a specific taxiway after landing.</p>

<p>There can be different reasons for this, but generally it is an attempt to expedite traffic flow on the ground at the airport. For example, if you are landing on a long runway and your parking position is near the far end of the runway, I might ask you to keep the plane rolling down the runway and vacate at the end, in order for you to have a shorter taxi time.</p>

<p>It could also be that the taxiway you would normally use to leave the runway is blocked by another aircraft or vehicle, and I want you to leave the runway via a taxiway that is further down the runway.</p>

<p>However, extending the landing roll does extend the runway occupancy time as well, so if there is another aircraft behind you on short final I will not offer you to perform a long landing roll. This is also why you should always ask ATC if you are planning to perform a long landing for one reason or the other&nbsp;&ndash; if we have someone else just a couple miles behind you, we might have to instruct them to go around if you do not vacate the runway like we expect you to.</p>

<p>With regards to reverse thrust specifically, there are airports where the use of reverse thrust is only permitted in special situations. This is to reduce the noise level at and around the airport. However, this is purely a regulatory thing, and is not actually related to ATC.</p>

<p>ICAO offers the following guidance on  the subject (DOC 4444):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>7.10.3.1    When necessary or desirable in order to expedite traffic, a landing aircraft may be requested to:  </p>
  
  <p>a) hold short of an intersecting runway after landing; </p>
  
  <p>b) land beyond the touchdown zone of the runway; </p>
  
  <p>c) vacate the runway at a specified exit taxiway; </p>
  
  <p>d) expedite vacating the runway. </p>
  
  <p>7.10.3.2    In requesting a landing aircraft to perform a specific landing and/or roll-out manoeuvre, the type of aircraft, runway length, location of exit taxiways, reported braking action on runway and taxiway, and prevailing meteorological conditions shall be considered. A HEAVY aircraft shall not be requested to land beyond the touchdown zone of a runway. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The retractable landing gear issue is particularly notable because
  early in the landing roll you may not have enough weight on the wheels
  to activate the squat switch that prevents you from retracting your
  gear while you're using them to hold the plane up. Your perfect
  landing could turn into a nice, smooth gear-up incident if you bump
  the wrong switch.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How does the squat switch work (which prevent gear up on the ground)?</li>

one</a>)?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The squat switch is essentially a sensor that senses if the weight of the aircraft is resting on the gear. This can be done by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">load cell</a> or displacement sensor on the suspension arm.</p>

<p>Like any other component these sensors can fail though engineers prefer them to fail in an always on (weight on the gear) state; that way the pilot just needs to deal with gear failing to retract after takeoff and needing to land again to check it out rather than dropping the plane on the ground and causing more damage.</p>

<li>Is a de-icing area part of the ramp?</li>
</ul>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>In addition I guess this may varies between countries and/or aeronautical jurisdiction. </p>

<p>Can someone provide an accurate view of the lingo and explain whether some are related or synonymous? (filling the blanks if some important term is missing).</p>
","<p>Apron and ramp (in US) mean the same, though the official term is apron. FAA Advisory Circular Number 120-57A <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%20120-57A.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Surface Movement and Guidance Control System</a> defines it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apron (Ramp). A defined area on an airport intended to accommodate aircraft for purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.</p>

<p>Now, the apron includes parking, maintenance and service areas, including taxi lanes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The apron area includes the following components: </p>
  
  <p>(1) Aircraft Parking Positions.  Intended for parking aircraft to enplane/deplane passengers, load or unload cargo.</p>
  
  <p>(2)  Aircraft Service Areas.  in or adjacent to an aircraft parking position.Intended for use by personnel/equipment for servicing aircraft and staging of equipment to facilitate loading and unloading of aircraft.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this a binary split: Runways vs tarmac?</p>

<p>Kinda. Basically, the areas in airport where aircraft are involved are divided (by the FAA atleast) into runway, taxiway and apron. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i.  Movement Area.  Refers to the runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport which are used for taxiing or hover taxiing, air taxiing, takeoff, and landing of aircraft,exclusive of loading ramps and aircraft parking areas.</p>

<p>It is part of the ramp/apron</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is a taxiway considered part of the apron?</p>

<p>Nope. As already noted.</p>

<p>Tarmac is a trademark of <a href=""http://www.tarmac.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tarmac limited</a>, which supplies construction materials for a a number of airports (among others), though most of the aprons are actually made of concrete.</p>

"What is the standard rate of turn for heavy aircraft?","6812","","<p>I have heard and read many times that for ""heavy aircraft"", they use a standard rate of turn which is 1.5° per second (4 minute turn), but I have never found an official source which addresses this. Although... I'm actually not even sure where the normal 3° per second (2 minute) standard rate turn is defined either.</p>

<p>The wikipedia entry on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT_%28aviation%29"">ROT (Aviation)</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Light aircraft are equipped with 2-minute turn indicators while heavy aircraft are equipped with 4-minute turn indicators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see why ""heavy"" would have anything to with turning rate, but airspeed certainly does.
So, I'm wondering if this is true, or just something they think is true because airplanes often use half-rate turns at airspeeds above 250 knots and bank limiting prevents them from making a standard rate turn at airspeeds above ≈ 200 knots?</p>
","<p>I'm only able to find the following about bank angles, which specifically refers to turns while in a holding pattern:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0503.html#Rn7352webb"">AIM 5-3-8</a>6.(b):</p>

  <p>(1) 3 degrees per second; or</p>
  
  <p>(2) 30 degree bank angle; or</p>
  
  <p>(3) 25 degree bank provided a flight director system is used.</p>
  
  <p><strong>NOTE-</strong><br>
  Use whichever requires the least bank angle.</p>

<p>This is also in the <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/instrument_procedures_handbook/media/FAA-H-8261-1A.pdf"">Instrument Procedures Handbook</a> which under *<em>High Performance Holding</em> on page 3-25 says that a flight director has a bank angle limit of 25 degrees.</p>

<p>If we use the above guidelines, then a flight director will use 3 degrees per second or 25 degrees of bank, whichever is less.  My calculations give us the following bank angles and associated rate of turns<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<pre><code>        Standard Rate      Actual        Rate
TAS      Bank Angle      Bank Angle     of turn

440        52.15           25.00         1.09
480        54.54           25.00         1.00
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, a jet travelling at 480 Knots TAS (not uncommon at altitude) would require almost a 55 degree bank angle to make a standard rate turn, which would be an amount considered by almost anyone as excessive. </p>

<p>When limited to 25 degrees of bank, this would result in a rate of turn of 1 degree per second (or a 6 minute turn).  Anything over 160 Knots TAS would be less than a standard rate turn, and once past 320 Knots TAS it  wouldn't even be a 1/2 standard rate turn.  </p>

<p>As far as the 1/2 Standard Rate, they often use the 1/2 BANK autopilot mode at high altitudes.  This would result in a rate of turn approximately halved, so a 360 degree turn would take 12 minute at the same 480 Knots TAS.  ATC expects the normal bank in the terminal environment though, so it isn't used at lower altitudes.</p>

<p>As others have said, transport category jets don't even have a rate of turn indicator (it isn't required by 14 CFR 25 if you have a third attitude indicator) and they simply fly bank angles.  Normal hand flying is limited to 30 degrees, which would allow a standard rate turn at a slightly higher airspeed, but then starts to taper off just the same.</p>

<p>That being said, the <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf"">Instrument Flying Handbook</a> does include this little tidbit in the section on turn indicators on page 5-21:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dial of these instruments is marked “2 MIN TURN.”  Some
  turn-and-slip indicators used in faster aircraft are  marked “4 MIN
  TURN.” In either instrument, a standard  rate turn is being made
  whenever the needle aligns with a  doghouse. A standard rate turn is
  3° per second. In a 2 minute  instrument, if the needle is one needle
  width either side of  the center alignment mark, the turn is 3° per
  second and the  turn takes 2 minutes to execute a 360° turn. In a 4
  minute  instrument, the same turn takes two widths deflection of the 
  needle to achieve 3° per second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe at some point in the past it was more common (or maybe faster but-not-quite-as-fast-as-todays-jets) but you just don't see that anymore.  (It could be where all of the references to 1/2 standard rate turns come from though.)</p>

"Do unused parachutes need to be repacked? If so how often and why?","6804","","<p>I was reading some military fiction and saw a comment that army airborne operations were required to repack all parachutes every ninety days, allowing parachutes that were due to be repacked soon to be cheaply used for training. This got me thinking: do parachutes need to be repacked on a schedule? Is this uniform across all types of parachutes and use cases? (are there differences between military and civilian requirements?) How long is the repack cycle? Why is scheduled repacking needed?</p>
","<p>Yes, parachutes need to be repacked regularly. The length of the interval depends on the material of the parachute and is between 60 and 180 days. Every parachute should have a small pocket with a piece of paper which lists the most recent repack date and the name of the packer (who needs to comply with <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=8f10e5643aa978d2c6fa5789894ead0c&amp;mc=true&amp;n=pt14.2.65&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML#sp14.2.65.f"">FAR part 65, subpart F</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) No pilot of a civil aircraft may allow a parachute that is
  available for emergency use to be carried in that aircraft unless it
  is an approved type and has been packed by a certificated and
  appropriately rated parachute rigger—</p>
  
  <p>(1) Within the preceding 180 days, if its canopy, shrouds, and harness
  are composed exclusively of nylon, rayon, or other similar synthetic
  fiber or materials that are substantially resistant to damage from
  mold, mildew, or other fungi and other rotting agents propagated in a
  moist environment; or</p>

  composed of silk, pongee, or other natural fiber or materials not

"Why are propeller engines uncommon on airliners?","6802","","<p>My experience in aviation is essentially zero, but looking at Wikipedia it seems like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tu-95 Bear</a> offers high subsonic speed and extreme range.</p>

<p>I assume that turboprop engines are more fuel efficient than jet engines. If all the above are true then why we do not get to see more rotary engine planes in commercial airline flights?</p>

<p>Is it a noise concern? I see that the TU-95 is apparently the ""noisiest military aircraft on Earth"".</p>
","<p>Well, first let's clear up a few terms.<br>
When you say ""rotary"" engine I'm assuming you're referring to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_engine"">radial engines</a>, a type of piston engine that used to be pretty common on aircraft. (These days <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposed-piston_engine"">opposed piston engines</a> are what you typically find on piston-powered aircraft, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine"">rotary engines</a> are yet another design, but their usage died out around the end of World War I.)</p>

<hr>

<p>The TU-95 is not actually a piston-powered aircraft - it's a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop"">turboprop</a> -- basically a turbine engine similar to what you'd find in a jet, only rigged up to turn a propeller rather than produce ""jet thrust"" directly.</p>

<p>From an efficiency standpoint, turbine engines are usually more fuel efficient than their piston counterparts, and jet fuel is produced in greater volume than aviation gasoline and is consequently cheaper for operators to procure. Turbine engines also offer more reliability than piston engines, and the maintenance on a turboprop engine is also largely similar to a jet engine with a few extra components, which is an advantage for a company operating a fleet of jet and propeller driven aircraft.</p>

<p>The differences in operating efficiency and reliability are the major reason why gasoline-powered piston engines have basically disappeared from scheduled airline service.</p>

<hr>

<p>So why don't we see more turboprops? Actually we see a lot of them, if you look in the right places.</p>

<p>Jets and Turboprops are good at different things -- broadly simplifying, a turboprop is more efficient at lower altitudes and airspeeds while a jet engine is more efficient at higher altitudes and airspeeds.  </p>

<p>As a result we see turboprop aircraft like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_72"">ATR 72s</a> in use for short-haul ""commuter"" service, but for trans-continental or trans-oceanic flights where they spend a long time cruising at high altitude jets dominate the sky.<br>
Since most people are flying to go relatively long distances there are comparatively more jets in scheduled airline service than turboprops.</p>

<p>Noise is probably also a factor - fast turboprops like the Bear are <strong><em>LOUD</em></strong> not due to the engine, but due to the propeller.  The tips of the spinning propeller on a TU-95 can approach supersonic speeds, which causes quite a bit of noise. The TU-95's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra-rotating_propellers"">contra-rotating propellers</a> (which help produce thrust more efficiently) also contribute to a louder noise footprint.<br>
In the case of the TU-95 this doesn't matter - it's a military plane, and the Russian air force doesn't care if people complain as the aircraft has a mission to complete and that's more important than a few noise complaints.  If United Airlines were to operate a TU-95 out of Kennedy departing over people's houses I suspect they would quickly reconsider their choice of equipment when the noise complaints started coming in...</p>

"Do pilots need a clearance to go around?","6791","","<p>I have read about the <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/10/exclusive-sfo-near-miss-might-have-triggered-greatest-aviation-disaster-in-history/"" rel=""noreferrer"">missed-SFO-accident</a> and watched the <a href=""https://youtu.be/Af2N3N5rURI?t=32s"" rel=""noreferrer"">2:22 movie</a>. I want to ask about going-around (or canceling takeoff) when the pilot is fully aware of an emergency that the tower is not (or is late at acting).</p>

<p>According to the reconstruction of the real missed-accident done by the news:</p>

<ul>
<li>Air Canada pilot was on final cleared to land, but instead heading to taxiway for reason that will be explained after FAA &amp; TSB investigations</li>
<li>Tower did not notice and did not complain, clearance was still ok</li>
<li>Pilot double-checked with tower because he saw lights on the ground</li>
<li>Tower double-confirmed clear to land</li>
<li>Other pilot on queue said ""where is this guy going?""</li>
<li>Tower requested go around</li>
<li>Air Canada flight crew initiated go around.</li>
</ul>

<p>The order of the last two events is currently not clear and subject to investigation.</p>

<p>In the movie both ingoing and outgoing pilots are scared by the sight of each other but ATC Dylan doesn't command action until the last moment, while clearance to land and take off is still granted for both.</p>

<p>It is clear that in the movie ATC has <em>failed</em> and pilot(s) are aware of a real danger that affects the safety of flight operation.</p>

<p>Like a driver sighting an animal on the road and braking (or worse moosing) without calling the police first. I am no pilot, I understand that flight is definitely different from driving. And I also enjoyed my time on MSFS virtual flight school. I said the above because I know it could be disappointing for experienced pilots.</p>

<p>I want to ask for my culture/curiosity: when a pilot is cleared to takeoff/land but sees a legitimate reason to cancel the maneuver (e.g. stop/go around), can he simply advise the tower that he is doing that or must continue as earlier instructed? AFAIK when an indicator indicates failiure at &lt; 80kt speed the pilot can immediately cancel takeoff, otherwise is required to continue.</p>

<p>My idea is that the Air Canada pilot could have told the tower something like ""we are now fully thrusting and going around because I am not sure about the safety of this landing, please give me further instructions for looping"" by his initiative.</p>

<p>This is allowed in the MSFS simulation (you can open virtual ATC radio and announce missed approach even a few feet above ground, they will tell you how to loop over the circuit asap). Is it allowed in reality, or do pilots need a clearance to go around?</p>
","<p>No, and this applies to any pilot, not just an airliner pilot. After the pilot has been cleared to land (or even if you're landing at your own discretion at an untowered airport), he can decide to <em>go around</em> instead of landing if he's dissatisfied with the approach for <strong>any reason</strong>.</p>

<p>The pilot might need to abort the landing for reasons the tower can't possibly know about, such as a <em>gear unsafe</em> indication, failing to achieve a stabilised approach, not making visual contact with the runway, or some distraction within the cockpit. And even in the case of a reason the tower should be able to tell - such as another aircraft infringing the runway, lining up on the wrong runway by accident, or birds on short final - the pilot must still go around if he thinks it's not safe to land, without waiting to be told.</p>

<p>The same applies to taking off. Even after being cleared to take off, the pilot must not take off if he thinks it is not safe to do so, even if it's for a reason the tower should know about, such as a runway obstruction or a take-off clearance on a crossing runway.</p>

"Why do DC-9 and MD-82 have engines that are slightly angled upwards?","6783","","<p>As per subject, I see that the above mentioned aircraft and some others that have engines mounted on the rear of the fuselage, have the engine intakes tilted slightly upwards. Why has this solution been implemented?</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be better having them parallel to ground?</p>

<p>If the airflow of the exhaust is directed slightly towards the ground would't it affect the plane causing it to push the nose downwards?</p>
","<p>I believe there this could be traced back to the so-called <strong>downwash angle</strong> of the air coming off the wing. </p>

<p>Looking at the picture below (and put on some imaginary engines on the back like the DC9/MD80), it becomes clear that by mounting it upwards by a few degrees would make it meet the airstream at the streamline angle:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Streamlines_around_a_NACA_0012.svg/302px-Streamlines_around_a_NACA_0012.svg.png"" alt=""Downwash""></p>

<p>You would want to that streamline to interact with the aircraft fan blades with the wind at the same angles. I would imagine that if you did not do this, it would result in an uneven force on the fan blades, which would probably be highly undesirable.</p>

<p>Looking at the drawings of the DC9, it might appear that the shorter version has a higher angle, and that the longer version has a smaller angle, as further from the wing the downwash angle is less, as could also be seen above. </p>

<p><img src=""https://www.the-blueprints.com/blueprints-depot/modernplanes/douglas/douglas-dc-9.gif"" alt=""DC9""></p>

<p>For a little further analysis, the following is apparently off the <a href=""http://www.pprune.org/archive/index.php/t-236280.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">DC-9 Manual</a>, and might shed a little more light on the design, in particular in the last paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The nacelles have been designed to enclose the JT8D engine with a
  shape that will allow the highest installed performance ( thrust minus
  drag ) possible at all flight conditions. The nacelle nose cowling is
  nonsymmetrical to keep the drag to a minimum at the high mach number
  cruising conditions.</p>
  
  <p>The nonsymmetry is required to maintain an extremely flat nacelle line
  adjacent to the fuselage, such that the nacelle supervelocity
  increments, when added to those from the pylon and fuselage, do not
  lead to super-critical velocities with resultant shockwave losses.</p>
  
  <p>The nacelle axis and pylon have been set at 3 degrees angle of attack
  relative to the fuselage to align them with the local flow conditions
  prevalent at cruising conditions. This is necessary to eliminate the
  interference and high induced drag that they would otherwise be
  subjected to. <strong>The nozzle is then canted upward relative to the engine
  axis, thus eliminating the pitching effects due to thrust</strong>.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following picture appears to show the nozzle angle is in fact more horizontal than the entry angle, with the underside longer than the upper side:</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3279/2734260605_33a35bd085_o.jpg"" alt=""MD80 engine""></p>

<p>Thus, while it might not aesthetically pleasing maybe to have it off by a few degrees from the fuselage body, but it does bring advantages when seen with the airflow, and resulting concerns about that the thrust is not being vectored along the body axis is corrected by the nozzle.</p>

"How do planes descend for landing?","6763","","<p>I fly occasionally  on a pretty short route on a turboprop (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Dash_8"" rel=""noreferrer"">DHC-8</a>). When the airplane descends for landing, I can look through the window and see the ground below getting closer over time. However I can't really tell what the pilots do to achieve that. I know that turns make you lose altitude, but it's very clear to me when the airplane makes a turn, so let's count that one out. So we're basically left with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Slight nose-down attitude</li>
<li>Reduction of engine power</li>
<li>Combination of both</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason I'm asking this is that during descent I do get this sensation of going down. However, during that time I cannot really see what the pilot did to achieve it. The nose-down attitude might be too minor for me to actually notice (I do not notice a slight nose-up cruising attitude to be honest). I hear a slight reduction in engine power a few times during a descent, but the feeling of going down and the audible noise reduction are separated in time. Is it that it takes time for an airplane to reduce speed (and as a result, descend) when you reduce engine power?</p>

<p>One additional question: I guess that with all the electronics in the cockpit pilots just set a target altitude or rate of descent, and then the airplane systems apply the correct measures to achieve this. How does the airplane know how much to reduce engine power and/or pitch to achieve this exact rate of descent?</p>
","<p>If the pilot reduces the airspeed while he increases the rate of descent, you will not notice any change in pitch attitude when the aircraft descends. With jets you should be able to hear a change in engine pitch when thrust is reduced. Turboprops run their engines at constant speed, and a reduction in power here means a reduction in propeller pitch. This causes the propeller noise to change, but this change is harder to discern. With a little practice you should be able to hear the slight drop in propeller noise which signals the begin of the descent, though.</p>

<p>Gliders control their sink rate by flying in rising or sinking air, and additionally by flying slow (and near their minimum sink rate) or fast. To descend quickly, they can open speed brakes and/or <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/15250/what-happens-after-a-rudder-hardover/15259#15259"">sideslip</a>. My favorite for a fast descent is to spin the aircraft, but <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/753/is-spin-recovery-possible-in-an-airliner"">airliners do not use this option</a>.</p>

<p>In order to produce the necessary lift to keep the aircraft in the air, the pilot picks a combination of speed and angle of attack at which lift equals weight. Other combinations would result in an accelerating vertical speed and are only used in transitions from one flight state to the next.</p>

<p>To arrive at the aircraft's pitch attitude, you need to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/12714/why-do-airplanes-lift-up-their-nose-to-climb/12720#12720"">add the flight path angle to this angle of attack</a>. If the plane descends with a flight path angle of -3° and the pilot reduces speed such that he needs to increase the angle of attack by the same 3° to produce the same lift, the resulting pitch angle of the aircraft would stay the same.</p>

<p>Normally, the correct answer to your question is 2. <em>Reduction of engine power</em>. But the other answers are also correct: If the speed is held constant, the attitude has to be reduced by the desired flight path angle change. Note that this is achieved by reducing thrust alone. If the pilot wishes to descend really fast, he might move to answer 3. <em>Combination of both</em> as in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9045/how-to-do-a-rapid-descent-in-a-jet-with-inoperative-spoilers"">this answer</a>.</p>

"How do people suffering from hypoxia not realize they aren't getting enough oxygen?","6759","","<p>I've seen reports of flight passengers/crew suffering hypoxia, and many times without knowing it.</p>

<p>My question is, how could you not be aware of it? For example, at above 10000ft, if your body is suffering from a lack of oxygen, doesn't it make you breathe faster and harder? (which in turn, makes you aware that something is wrong in the air you're breathing)</p>

<p>Second question: if you're dealing with air containing half as much oxygen, is it not enough (sustainable) to inhale (faster) twice as much air when breathing (without oxygen mask of course) ?</p>
","<p>The key point here is that your body does not measure blood oxygen levels. Instead, the urge to breathe is caused by a surplus of carbon dioxide in your blood. At sea level, this is fine: the only way to get so much carbon dioxide in your blood is if you used up all the oxygen.</p>

<p>At higher altitudes, the pressure is lower, and consequently the oxygen partial pressure. Since the rate of diffusion in your lungs is a function of pressure, this means that oxygen will diffuse less readily into your blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide diffuses more readily out of your blood due to the low pressure. This reduces your urge to breathe; you do not feel 'out of breath'. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization#Need_for_cabin_pressurization"">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>At even higher altitudes, the pressure is actually so low that breathing will cause oxygen to diffuse out of your blood; you can breathe as much as you want but the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood will never be higher than the partial oxygen pressure in the air. This is why oxygen masks work (even if they're not airtight): they replace all air near your nose and mouth with oxygen, so that the partial pressure of oxygen equals the total atmospheric pressure rather than the usual ~21%. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness"">this</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression"">this</a> Wikipedia page, or for example <a href=""http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UN3W4d-5RPo"">this YouTube video</a>.</p>

<p>Somewhat related: at sea level, you can also run out of oxygen before you feel the urge to breathe. You might think that breathing deeply before having to hold your breath for a long time increases the amount of oxygen in your blood, increasing your endurance. This is only partially true: it also artificially reduces your carbon dioxide levels, reducing your urge to breathe. This way, you can <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_blackout"">black out before feeling out of breath</a>, which can be dangerous under water! </p>

<p>It appears to me that <strong>this phenomenon only appears during the approach phase</strong> of a flight and during low speed turns, or rather when the <strong>angle of attack is rather high</strong>. Also, usually the flaps are deployed when it happens, yet I'm not sure if that makes a difference. </p>

<p>Considering this, <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14327/what-is-the-mechanism-by-which-condensation-forms-above-wings/14488#14488"">the answers</a> wouldn't necessarily answer my question. They all talk about how there is a lower pressure above the wing, which causes the dewpoint to drop and thus makes the water condense. But is there a ""lower"" lower pressure when the angle of attack is higher and therefore making this phenomenon occur more often? Or is the point at which the laminar airflow gets turbulent (which moves forward as the aoa is increased) an important factor here?</p>

<p>Here is a picture to show what condensation I mean:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ch95S.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ch95S.jpg"" alt=""shallow yet clearly visible clouds form on the wing""></a></p>

"Why is the Tu-144 the only commercial airplane with canard configuration?","6743","","<p>I understand the delta wing was chosen because of the supersonic cruise (like the Concorde), and canards were added to reduce the approach/landing speed. But canards may be used without delta wing (e.g. Focke Wulf F-19, Soukhoï Su-47, Rutan Voyager,...), so I don't understand why the canard wing configuration is not used among commercial aircraft.</p>
","<p>Short answer: Canards make most sense with negative static stability and high maneuverability. Commercial aircraft don't need either, so a conventional layout works best.</p>

<p>For a statically stable aircraft, the conventional layout gives most efficiency with sufficient damping. Static stability requires that the forward lifting surfaces create more lift proportionally to their size than the rear surfaces. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7528/why-is-the-use-of-tail-down-force-so-common/7529#7529"">Here is an answer</a> to a related question.</p>

<p>You want the airplane to return to the original flight attitude if it has been disturbed, say by a gust or a jolt on the stick. This can be done by creating proportionally more lift with the forward surfaces (= the wing in a conventional configuration) than with the rear surfaces (= the wing in a canard configuration). Say the jolt pitches the aircraft up. Now the aerodynamic forces should change in a way which increases lift proportionally more on the rear surfaces, so the aircraft pitches down and returns to it's original attitude. By distributing lift the way I mentioned above, the same change in angle of attack on both forward and rear surface will create a proportionally higher lift increase on the rear surface, making the aircraft (statically) stable.</p>

<p>That requires that one of the (mostly) two surfaces is not contributing as much to lift creation than it could. You want this surface to be the smaller one of both, so the whole configuration can create as much lift as possible at a given speed. A canard would be a poor choice for a commercial airplane, because the big wing would now fly at a fraction of it's potential.</p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8049/are-fighter-jets-designed-to-be-so-inherently-unstable-that-a-human-cant-fly-on/8061#8061"">Once you shift the center of gravity back</a> to improve maneuverability, things get different: Now the rear surface is creating proportionally more lift, so the smaller surface should go in front. Voilá, a canard!</p>

<p>Now add forward sweep, which will make the wing tips twist to higher angles of attack when lift is increased, and you get a really responsive aircraft (but need to be careful not to overstress it!). This was done on the X-29 and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-47"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Berkut</a>.</p>

<p>As jwenting pointed out, the canard on the Tu-144 was not a control surface, but should be considered a detached <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading-edge_slats"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">slat</a> of sorts.</p>

<p>And while we are at it: The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaggio_P.180_Avanti"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Piaggio Avanti</a> has a canard, and a conventional tail, too. Here the canard helps to put the wing spar behind the cabin area, makes it easier to fly with a wide range of c.g. locations and to increase aerodynamic damping. This is one of very few examples in commercial aircraft of canards done right!</p>

"What does it take to turn a 747 around 180 degrees?","6741","","<p>Assume that a 747 is flying at cruising altitude and speed. If the pilot decided (for a presumably good reason), to turn the plane 180 degrees,</p>

<ol>
<li>How quickly could the turn be completed?</li>
<li>How wide would the turn radius be?</li>
<li>How much altitude would be lost, if we're not assuming a level turn?</li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: I learned something new from both of the great answers below. I accepted the one that was easiest to follow. Since both answers assumed a level flight, I've added a #3.</p>
","<p>How long, and how wide of a turn depends entirely on three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the true airspeed.</li>
<li>What is the bank angle of the turn?</li>
<li>Is level flight maintained during the turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since it's easiest to calculate, and presumably what you intended, we'll assume #3 is true (level flight). However, if you really needed to get turned around fast, turning in a descent will give you a tight turn without the extra g-forces.</p>

<p>Cruise Speed for a 747 depends on altitude, generation, company guidelines, etc, but we'll go with Mach 0.85 for this example, which seems to be in the ballpark. If we say it's cruising at 35,000 feet in standard atmospheric conditions, that comes out to 490 knots TAS.</p>

<p>Next, pick a bank angle. A reasonable bank angle for that airplane with passengers on board is 25°, and you could probably get away with 30°. Anything beyond that will cause passengers to complain. Of course, if it's an emergency you might consider something higher. Just remember, the higher the bank angle, the stronger the g-forces which will be felt by the people inside, and the aircraft itself, which has structural limitations. The G-force can be calculated using:</p>

<p>$$
gforce = \frac{1}{\cos(bank)}
$$</p>

<hr>

<p>For an example, let's select 25° bank since that's the most realistic.</p>

<h2>Radius</h2>

<p>Calculate the radius of the turn using this formula, slightly modified <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_turn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from Wikipedia</a> to give nmi instead of feet:</p>

<p>$$
Radius\ of\ turn\ in\ nautical\ miles= \frac{velocity^2}{68579 \times \tan(bank)}
$$</p>

<p>Which gives us:</p>

<p>$$
7.51nmi = \frac{490^2}{68579 \times \tan(25°)}
$$</p>

<p>So the turn itself would be about 15 nautical miles wide (≈ 91,000 feet) not accounting for wind.</p>

<h2>Distance Traveled</h2>

<p>Using basic geometry, the distance traveled for a 180° turn is $d = r\pi$ (half the circumference of a circle), so:</p>

<p>$$
23.59= 7.51\pi
$$</p>

<p>Giving us 23.59 nautical miles traveled.</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>

<p>$$
time\ in\ minutes = \frac{distance \times 60}{TAS}
$$</p>

<p>Therefore, at 490 knots (nautical miles per hour) and 25° bank, <strong>it would take about 2 minutes, 53 seconds to complete the turn.</strong></p>

<p>$$
2.89 = \frac{23.59 \times 60}{490}
$$</p>

<p>You could go through and calculate the results for any speed and bank angle you want. This is true regardless of the type of airplane in question.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Turning in a Descent</h1>

<p>Your edited question asks how much altitude would be lost if it were not a level turn. There is also no single answer to this question because it depends entirely on how you perform the maneuver.</p>

<p>One reason you may <em>have to</em> descend in a turn is because the increased lift results un increased induced drag, and the aircraft engines may not have enough power to compensate, resulting in the decreased airspeed, and possibly a stall. In this case, the equations for calculating the turn radius are exactly the same as in level flight. The amount of altitude lost will depend on the descent rate required in order maintain airspeed, which will vary depending on the engine power available, the weight of the aircraft, and the drag curve at the given speed and AoA. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/8014"">Peter Kämpf's answer</a> gives an example of what this might look like for a 747 in a 1.5g turn.</p>

<p>Another version of a turning descent would be an accelerated descent. The advantage in this case it that it would allow turns to be made without additional g-force. The disadvantage is that you'll be accelerating downwards instead of descending at a constant rate. This can get out of hand <em>very</em> quickly and would only be good for very short duration turns.</p>

<p>To illustrate this disastrous option, let's look at what would happen in a 1g turn at the same 25° and 490 knots TAS. Since the math is more complicated, it'll be easier to talk about this portion in metric units. Here's a conversion table:</p>

<pre><code>1 nautical mile = 1852 meters
1 knot = 0.514444 meters per second
1 foot = 0.3048 meters
</code></pre>

<p>First, in order to maintain a constant 1g, the lift vector is simply rotated in the turn (instead of rotated <em>and increased</em> in order to maintain altitude). Therefore, the magnitude of our lift vector will be equal to the acceleration due to gravity near the Earth's surface. We'll round that to 9.8 m/s/s.</p>

<h2>Inward Acceleration</h2>

<p>Our acceleration towards the center of the turn $a_c$ (the portion of our lift vector pointed inwards instead of up) can be determined using the following equation where $\theta$ is the bank angle:</p>

<p>$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{a_c}{g}
$$</p>

<p>Solving for $a_c$:</p>

<p>$$
a_c = g\sin(\theta)
$$</p>

<p>Therefore</p>

<p>$$
4.142 = 9.8\sin(25°)
$$</p>

<h2>Radius</h2>

<p>So 4.142 meters per second per second is how fast, at 25° of bank, and 1g, we'll be accelerating towards the center of the turn. With that, information, along with our known velocity, we can calculate the radius of the turn using this equation where $v$ is our velocity in meters per second, and $R$ is the radius in meters:</p>

<p>$$
R = \frac{v^2}{a_c}
$$</p>

<p>Plug in our numbers:</p>

<p>$$
15341 = \frac{(490 \times 0.514444)^2}{4.142}
$$</p>

<p>This comes out to a radius of 15341 meters (8.28 nautical miles).</p>

<h2>Distance Traveled</h2>

<p>Now that we have our radius, we can calculate how long it will take us to turn 180°. This part is the same equation as before.</p>

<p>$$
48195 = 15341\pi
$$</p>

<p>Giving us 48195 meters (26 nautical miles).</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>

<p>Distance divided by velocity gives us duration.</p>

<p>$$
t = \frac{d}{v}
$$</p>

<p>In our case:</p>

<p>$$
191.2\ seconds = \frac{48195}{490 \times 0.514444}
$$</p>

<p>So, it'll take 3 minutes 11 seconds to complete the turn.</p>

<h2>Downward Acceleration</h2>

<p>The last value we need before we can calculate the altitude lost in the turn is to calculate how fast we're going to be accelerating towards the ground in this turn. Lets first calculate the upward portion of our lift vector:</p>

<p>$$
a_u = g\cos(\theta)
$$</p>

<p>Therefore</p>

<p>$$
8.882 = 9.8\cos(25°)
$$</p>

<p>Our lift vector is accelerating us upwards at 8.882 m/s/s, while gravity is trying to pull us down at -9.8 m/s/s. That comes out to a net vector of -0.918 m/s/s.</p>

<h2>Altitude Lost</h2>

<p>This part requires a little bit of calculus because our descent rate is accelerating. The integral of acceleration is velocity ($v = at$), and the integral of velocity is distance:</p>

<p>$$
d = \frac{at^2}{2}
$$</p>

<p>So, lets calculate the change in vertical distance (altitude):</p>

<p>$$
-16780 = \frac{-0.918 \times 191.2^2}{2}
$$</p>

<p>So, theoretically, our airplane lost 16,780 meters of altitude (55,052 feet). Of course, since we were only 35,000 feet in the air to begin with, this is rather bad news for us. Besides hitting the ground, you would also come close to risking structural damage to the airframe because in this example, 490 knots is considered the speed over the ground, but the total velocity would be higher (about 596 knots) by the end of the turn due to the sink rate.</p>

<p>You'll also notice that, assuming we had the altitude to lose in the first place, the turn took longer to complete than in level flight. This is because the magnitude of the lift vector was smaller.</p>

<p>You can feel free to experiment with other speeds and bank angles, and you could also experiment with higher g turns (simply replace $g$ in the equations with $2g$ or similar). In some cases higher than 1g, you may actually gain altitude, though it's unlikely a 747 would be able to sustain a high-g maneuver which gains altitude.</p>

<p>As a quick second example, consider a 2g turn with 80° of bank at 400 knots:</p>

<p>$$
a_c = 19.302 = 2g\sin(80°) \\
R = 2193.8 = \frac{400 \times 0.514444}{a_c} \\
d = 6892 = R\pi \\
t = 33.5 seconds \\
a_u = 3.404 = 2g\cos(80°)
$$</p>

<p>Giving a total altitude lost of 3589 meters (11,775 feet) over 33.5 seconds. However, at the end of the turn, you would have a sink rate of 214 meters (703 feet) per second. That's over 42,000 feet per minute. It would likely be possible to recover from that in the altitude remaining, but it would not be pleasant.</p>

"What are the different kinds of de-ice fluid?","6737","","<p>When frost adheres to the airplane or it is snowing, you need to make sure the airplane is clean when you depart.  You've probably seen the trucks spraying aircraft in the winter before departure, but what are the spraying it with?</p>

<p>I know of at least 4 types of de-/anti-ice fluids but perhaps there are others.  What does each fluid consist of and what is its function?  How do I know if these fluids are available at an airport I plan to operate from?  Are there limits in how soon I must depart once fluid is applied?</p>
","<h1>Fluid Types</h1>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicing_fluid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> contains a good summary of the different types of fluid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Types</strong>  </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Type I fluids have a low viscosity, and are considered ""unthickened"". They provide only short term protection because they
  quickly flow off surfaces after use. They are typically sprayed on hot
  (130–180°F, 55-80°C) at high pressure to remove snow, ice, and frost.
  Usually they are dyed orange to aid in identification and application.</p></li>
  <li><p>Type II fluids are pseudoplastic, which means they contain a polymeric thickening agent to prevent their immediate flow off
  aircraft surfaces. Typically the fluid film will remain in place until
  the aircraft attains 100 knots or so (almost 200 km/h), at which point
  the viscosity breaks down due to shear stress. The high speeds
  required for viscosity breakdown means that this type of fluid is
  useful only for larger aircraft. The use of type II fluids is
  diminishing in favour of type IV. Type II fluids are generally light
  yellow in color.</p></li>
  <li><p>Type III fluids can be thought of as a compromise between type I and type II fluids. They are intended for use on slower aircraft, with
  a rotation speed of less than 100 knots. Type III fluids are generally
  light yellow in color.</p></li>
  <li><p>Type IV fluids meet the same AMS standards as type II fluids, but they provide a longer holdover time. They are typically dyed green to
  aid in the application of a consistent layer of fluid.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Chemical Composition</strong></p>
  
  <p>The main component of deicing fluid is usually propylene glycol or
  ethylene glycol. Other ingredients vary depending on the manufacturer,
  but the exact composition of a particular brand of fluid is generally
  held as confidential proprietary information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Call ahead to the airport to see what kind of deice/anti-ice fluid that they have because each one is different.</p>

<h1>Time Limits</h1>

<p>Every year, the FAA publishes tables which include information about how long the various deice fluids will provide protection under various weather conditions.  Here is an example table:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8JSa.jpg"" alt=""Holdover Table""></p>

<p>For this particular fluid (ABAX ECOWING AD-49 Type IV) we can lookup a specific example such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>-10 Degrees Celcius</li>
<li>75% fluid and 25% water</li>
<li>Light Snow</li>
</ul>

<p>This shows that the fluid will provide protection for 1:40 to 2:05. If you are delayed longer than that, you will need to deice again.  Since <strong>every</strong> part of the aircraft needs to be protected, the timing starts when they first start spraying the aircraft.  Note that other types of fluid (particularly Type I fluids) have <strong>much</strong> shorter holdover times than this, so be careful and make sure that you check!</p>

"Are there diversion points for southern Pacific great circle route flights?","6722","","<p>At first I wasn't even sure if any airlines flew southern Pacific great circle route flights, but it looks like Qantas (<a href=""http://flightaware.com/live/flight/QFA27/history/20140111/0150Z/YSSY/SCEL"">QFA27</a>) operates a flight between Sydney and Santiago, Chile.</p>

<p>For northern Pacific greate circle routes, you are flying near Canada/Alaska and then Russia for most of the flight, so you have some airports you could potentially divert to if an emergency arose. I've search online for more details about how this works for these flight, but haven't had much luck finding information.</p>

<p>Are there any point on the southern Pacific great circle route for flights to divert to? Or is there not really any backup plan if something goes wrong? Are there specific requirements that must be met for an aircraft to fly this route?</p>
","<p>This particular flight was a Boeing 747 flying from YSSY (Sidney) to SCEL (Santiago).  Because a 747 has more than two engines, they don't have specific time limits on how far from land that they can fly like two engine airplanes do.</p>

<p>That being said, they do have to carry enough fuel to make it to a suitable airport in the event that the airplane depressurizes or it has an engine failure at any point along their route.<sup>1</sup>.  This doesn't mean that they have to make it all of the way to their destination in the event of a problem though.  They use en-route diversion airports and have predefined points on their flight plan which tell them where to divert to at any given point during the flight.</p>

<p>You will notice on this flight (see the images below) that their planned route is considerably further North than the shorter great circle route.  This is probably so that they can use NTAA (Tahiti) as a diversion airport if they have a problem.  The route is also optimized for the current winds at the cruising altitude, so it may be more fuel efficient to go out of the way in order to have more favorable winds.  </p>

<p>In this case, without seeing their actual dispatch paperwork we can't know for sure whether or not they could have even flown the great circle route with the amount of fuel that the airplane can hold, but we'll just assume that they are using NTAA as an ETOPS airport for the purposes of this discussion.  That being said, we will use the following airports as our ETOPS diversion airports:  NZCH, NTAA, and SCEL.  In this case, their diversion plan in the event of an emergency would probably be something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>From takeoff (YSSY) until a point a little less than half way to NZCH (New Zealand)<sup>2</sup> they would divert back to their point of departure<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>From a little less than half way to NZCH until a point around 46W52 they would divert to NZCH.</li>
<li>Between the points that would be around 46W52 and 47W25 they would divert to NTAA.</li>
<li>After 47W25 they would continue on to their destination (SCEL) because it would be faster than turning around and going back to any of the other airports.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the points takes wind into consideration, and as they pass each one they will always know which airport that they can reach in the least amount of time.  The most important thing is that they always have enough fuel to make it <em>somewhere safe</em> in the event of an emergency.</p>

"Why don't helicopter blades look like other propellers?","6712","","<p>While doing an image search, I found many different shaped propellers and asked about them in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8907/propeller-shapes"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>In it, Peter Kampf answered my question with his usual thoroughness. However, as I looked at more images of various shaped blades, I saw images of the helicopters of my youth, Bells. The Bell Huey and the Cobra both have very long, very squared off primary blades. They don't have an aerodynamic looking shape and both the leading and trailing edges are straight.</p>

<p>Why would Bell have chosen this shape and not the shape more like a 'normal' plane propeller?</p>
","<p>Helicopter blades need to be long and thin. The diameter of the rotor disc determines the efficiency of the rotor at low speeds and can be compared to the wing span in fixed-wing airplanes. The rotation creates strong centrifugal loads at the blade roots which grow with the square of the tip radius at a given rotation speed, so they cannot be tapered much. Adding chord to the middle of the blade would increase its area and add more friction drag, increasing the torque needed to keep the rotor spinning. If the helicopter is only designed for hover, the blade tips could be tapered, but the added complications of forward flight make a rectangular blade the better choice.</p>

<p>In forward flight, the speeds due to the blade's rotation and the flight speed add up, increasing local airspeed at the advancing blade and reducing it at the receding blade. Since the center of lift is trimmed to be at the rotor hub using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashplate_(aeronautics)"">swash plate</a>, the advancing blade has a smaller angle of attack and the receding blade a higher angle of attack. On the receding blade at high flight speed, the root will be in reverse flow since here the rotation speed will not be high enough to compensate for the flight speed. Dynamic pressure is around zero at the middle radius, and only the tip area sees sufficient dynamic pressure to create the lift which is demanded from the blade. Reducing this tip area would reduce the lift which can be produced there, so designers kept the blade chord constant.</p>

<p>Two effects limit the maximum forward speed: The remaining dynamic pressure at the blade tip of the receding blade, and the maximum Mach number at the advancing blade's tip. In order to increase this maximum Mach number, modern rotor tips are swept, but simple sweep will lead to torsion moments which will twist the blade. The pitching moment along the blade needs to be finely balanced so no torsion loads result. To achieve this, helicopter blade airfoils are either symmetric or reflex, and the tip is first swept forward and then backward, so the resulting lift acts exactly at the <a href=""http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/elastic+axis"">elastic axis</a> of the blade. See the picture of such a blade tip below. The small trim tab you can see at the trailing edge is used for fine-tuning the pitching moment of the blade.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BPmHY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I would not be surprised if an optimized rotor shape has non-rectangular blades, but my impression is that the gains of optimization are small, especially with the wide spread of operation conditions of all rotor blade sections. The rectangular blade is easy to manufacture and good enough for most cases. However, I have not designed a rotor myself and do not know enough about the details to be more specific.</p>

"What are the landing stall speeds of a Cessna 172?","6703","","<p>I understood from <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14909/why-is-stall-speed-listed-in-a-poh"">Why is stall speed listed in a POH?</a> that the Cessna Skyhawk POH lists stall speeds for specific conditions due to a lack of AoA indicator. However, what's unclear to me is what the stall speeds actually are.</p>

<h2>Page ii</h2>

<p>In page ii of the <a href=""http://www.gaceflyingclub.com/Member%20Download/172S%20Skyhawk%20Information%20Manual%20Searchable.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cessna 172 POH</a> it lists <code>48 KCAS</code> for the <code>Flaps Down, Power Off</code>-configuration:</p>

<h2>Page 2-5</h2>

<p>Then on page 2-5 it lists the white arc spanning <code>40 - 85 KIAS</code>, with <code>Lower limit is maximum weight Vs0 in landing configuration.</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wv1hr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wv1hr.png"" alt=""Cessna 172 POH: Airspeed Indicator Markings""></a></p>

<p>According the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">V Speeds Wikipedia page</a> <code>Vs0</code> is <code>Stall speed or minimum flight speed in landing configuration.</code> I understand that KCAS is not the same as KIAS, but this is quite a significant difference.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> what is the actual stall speed for a Cessna 172 while in landing condition and what do these two data points in the POH mean?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

<p>At low speed, near the stall, 40 KIAS (the low end of the white arc) and 48 KCAS (Vs0 in the POH) refer to the same actual speed. While there is a limited divergence (0 to 2%) between CAS and IAS at medium and high speed, this difference can be as much as 20% at low speed, when the aircraft pitch is large.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>In your question, you mention:</p>

<ul>
<li>The POH states a Vs0 of 48 KCAS.</li>
<li>The low end of the airspeed indicator white arc is 40 KIAS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The end of the white arc is also Vs0. That's a bit confusing indeed as two types of measures are used, but in fact they refer in practical to the same actual airspeed.</p>

<p><em>Indicated airspeed</em></p>

<p>Unless computations are done, airspeed values displayed to the pilot IAS (indicated airspeed). </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MD42c.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MD42c.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>(<a href=""http://steven-pam.photoshelter.com/image/I0000viQ2xxglizw"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>)</sup></p>

<p><em>Errors affecting IAS</em></p>

<p>IAS reflects directly the difference between the total air pressure in the pitot tube, and the (mean) static air pressure at different static air pressure ports (on the side of the aircraft and in the pitot). The difference (the dynamic pressure) is subject to possible errors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Total air pressure is wrong it the probe axis is not parallel to the airflow. Obviously the pitot tube angle changes between low and high speeds. For a given speed the pitot pitch also varies with mass and balance, and the status of drag devices such as flaps and landing gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Static air pressure at a pressure port is likely affected by pressure variations created by the aircraft fuselage. This error greatly depends on the port location and its design, but also on the yaw angle.</p></li>
<li><p>Airspeed indicator itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Obtaining CAS from IAS</em></p>

<p>All V-speeds are defined in term of ""calibrated"" airspeed (CAS). The aircraft manufacturer provides tables to find the CAS from the IAS read on the airspeed indicator. These tables defined for different drag devices status (e.g. flaps values) are valid at sea level and 15°C. They are included in the POH. I found this C172N one online:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD8g3.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD8g3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
<sup>(Source: <a href=""http://www.skywarriorinc.com/downloads/POH%20BOOKS/172N%20POH.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">POH C172N 1978</a>)</sup></p>

<p>For a 40° full flaps the table says that 40 KIAS are actually 47 KCAS. This is close to the 48 KCAS in your POH.</p>

<p>As you realized, the difference between KCAS and KIAS becomes larger as the air speed decreases, because the angle of attack and the errors in pressure measurement increase.</p>

<p><em>Multiple ways to express airspeed</em></p>

<p>TAS depends on parameters and need to be computed. However it can be approximated by the indicated airspeed. IAS is close to the TAS in favorable atmospheric conditions (sea level air density), and at low angles of attack.</p>

<p>The IAS is easy to display to the pilot using the an aneroid cell. For higher angles of attack, the calibrated airspeed (CAS) corrects for instrument and probe placement errors. CAS can be obtained using manufacturer tables. CAS, as IAS, is valid at sea level and 15°C.</p>

<p>When the air temperature or pressure are not close to the ideal ones (15° and 1013 hPa), then CAS differs from TAS.</p>

<p>The ASI usually has a window (see above) for reading the TAS after the outside temperature and altitude pressure have been selected.</p>

<p>(At speed higher than 200 KCAS or altitude higher than 10,000 ft, the compressibility of air becomes significant, and the equivalent airspeed (EAS) is better suited to describe the aerodynamic effects.)</p>

<p>Vs0 is determined assuming the maximum landing weight and the most unfavorable CG location. It is expressed in KCAS. If the Vs0 CAS were unknown, the pilot wouldn't be able to correct it to include the effect of weight and balance changes.</p>

<p>The ASI, because no correction is done, can display only IAS. So the IAS value for the lower speed of the white arc (Vs0) is in KIAS.</p>

"Why do most radial engines use an odd number of cylinders?","6703","","<p>To help suppress vibration, most <em>'V'</em> and <em>'horizontal'</em> engines use an <strong><em>even number of cylinders</em></strong> as closely opposed as possible. Radial engines are well known for excessive vibration. For some reason they nearly always use a <strong><em>staggered odd number of cylinders</em></strong> that would seem to promote vibration, why?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0wHx.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0wHx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>An odd number of cylinders is required by the combination of the single-crank radial design, the four-stroke (Otto) work cycle, and the desire to keep the power strokes evenly spaced in time. </p>

<p>To keep the design simple and lightweight, a single-bank radial airplane engine has one crank, which means that the pistons must reach the top of their travel in rotation order. But the four-stroke cycle requires that a piston must reach the top of its travel twice for each power stroke. The only way to promote evenly timed power strokes is to fire every other cylinder in rotation order. </p>

<p>With an even number of cylinders this would require a hesitation or skip in the firing sequence on every rotation as the engine switched between the odd and even cylinders. With an odd number of cylinders the timing is quite naturally smooth. For example, the firing order of a nine-cylinder radial is 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 8.</p>

<p>If you could watch a radial airplane engine in slow motion you would see that when a cylinder is in its compression stroke, the cylinders on either side of it are in their exhaust strokes, and when a cylinder is beginning its power stroke, the cylinders on either side of it are near to beginning their intake strokes. </p>

<p>Two-stroke radial engines do not need to have an odd number of cylinders. </p>

"How does the weather radar work?","6674","","<p>I was reading <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9602/how-do-pilots-foresee-turbulence"">this question</a> about turbulence and how pilots foresee it, and in one of the answers, @Rhino Driver states:</p>

  <p><strong>Weather Radar</strong> Just like using your eyes, except the radar can see further through haze and other clouds. Typically this is useful for finding embedded thunderstorms, but it can also be useful to find areas of potential turbulence</p>

<p>And that make me wonder...</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the airliner's on-board weather radar work?</li>
<li>Is it connected to ground base stations to synchronize the weather info?</li>
<li>What kind of ""weather types"" can it detect? (i.e. thunderstorms, light rain, clear weather) </li>
</ul>
","<p>It works the same way any radar works.  An antenna broadcasts a pulse of energy and listens for its reflection and interprets the power of the reflection to calculate the reflectivity factor Z, expressed in decibels dBZ (helpful because return power varies across many orders of magnitude).  Weather radar can see water, hail, bugs, birds, bats and bigger things, and the ground but not clouds.  Higher return power can mean more objects or bigger objects.  A basic single-polarization radar cannot tell the difference between a tons of small rain drops and a fewer big raindrops.  </p>

<p>The particulars of the radar on any aircraft are generally going to be determined by the antenna size, as the optimal frequency of emission varies for a given antenna.  The large S-band* dishes that make up the ground based WSR-88D network are quite big (around 10m).  S-band is a good choice because they have low attenuation and can penetrate through storms and see things behind them.  Airplanes can't use S-band though, because the antennas are too big to put on the airplane and require too much power to fully utilize them.</p>

<p>Airplane radars are generally in the X-band*.  X-band can see smaller particles than S-band but attenuates easier.  This means if a big storm is in front of you, the energy doesn't penetrate far into the storm and may not show you the whole storm.  These are great short range radars and work well in airborne applications as long as you are aware of the issue with attenuation.</p>

<p>Airplane radar displays typically only display information from the on-board radar and do not downlink any additional information from ground stations.  Onboard radar are usually adjustable in the vertical by the pilots, so they can point the radar up or down as needed.</p>

Newspapers for the area on that day show no information that I can see. Can anyone think of a reason for an A-10 to be flown over this location on this date?</p>
","<h2>Practice makes perfect!</h2>

<p>Groton, NH (along with a large chunk of rural New Hampshire further off to the north) sits more or less under an area of military Special Use Airspace called the Yankee 1 and 2 Military Operating Area complex, or MOA for short:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDSm4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDSm4.png"" alt=""section of the sectional showing Yankee 1 MOA in reference to Hebron, NH and the road from Hebron to Groton, NH, as well as Newfound Lake""></a></p>

<p>(If you're wondering why Groton is not on the map, ask FAA/NACO -- it's about at the bend in the road WNW of Hebron, right under the southern edge of the Yankee 1 MOA.  The snippet was taken using vfrmap.org.)</p>

<p>These areas of airspace are used by US military tactical pilots to practice their tactical maneuvers (such as ""dry"" practice bomb and strafing runs, and air combat maneuvering) without getting in the way of other airspace users -- high-performance jets making sharp maneuvers don't mix well with slow little propeller planes or not-so-maneuverable airliners!</p>

<p>As to why the pilot was circling?  They were probably killing time, waiting for their practice partner to show up, or the MOA to free up so they could use it.  Also, the airplane in the picture looks to be unarmed -- on one side is an empty pair of Sidewinder rails, while the other side carries a pair of targeting and countermeasures pods.</p>

<p>So, what your mom saw was a small part of our military keeping their gun oiled and ready, so to speak -- practice makes perfect, after all, and the airspace over rural parts of the US is about the only place in this country non-busy enough to serve as a suitable practice area.</p>

"Why does afterburner exhaust have ""pulses""?","6661","","<p>Instead of being consistently-dense, the afterburner exhaust looks ""pulsed"" in these pictures below.  Is this a trick of the camera, a natural result of interaction with the air, or is there some design science in the propulsion system that causes this effect?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcvQ0.jpg"" alt=""F-15 afterburners""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fk8SC.jpg"" alt=""F-22 afterburners""></p>
","<p>Those are known as ""Mach diamonds"" or ""Shock diamonds"" (and a number of other names) and are not a characteristic of the afterburner per se but are formed by standing waves in the exhaust when the pressure of the expanded exhaust gases do not exactly match external ambient pressure. They can be formed by either over-expansion or under-expansion of the exhaust gases. The diamonds form at the transition from sonic to supersonic flow which occurs immediately on the ""downstream"" side of a rocket or jet engine nozzle. </p>

<p>In rockets, flow through such a nozzle is always sonic at the throat (in all except trivially low pressure systems where it can be subsonic - but these are not usually encountered in practice. </p>

<p>In jet engines, whether flow is sonic or supersonic at the exhaust depends on the design which in turn tends to depend on the application. ""Pure jet"" engines which use a combustion driven compressor to compress input air and which develop their thrust from the jet exhaust will usually have supersonic exhausts. Ongoing development has led to a range of ""jet"" engine types with somewhat differing capabilities - turbojet (""pure"" jet), turbofan (jet driven internal ""fan"" produces air which partially bypasses jet proper), turboprop (jet drives external propellor),propfan (turboprop on steroids optimised for close to Mach 1 cruise) and some fellow travellers such as turboshaft - like a turboprop but with shaft output - useful if you want to power eg a helicopter. </p>

<p>In a turbo-fan engine the amount of air which bypasses the jet engine proper is governed by the ""bypass ratio"". High bypass engines send most air past the jet proper to be combined with the jet exhaust and form the actual engine exhaust. Pure jet or some ""low bypass ratio"" turbo fan engines may have supersonic exhausts while ""high bypass ratio"" turbofan are always subsonic. Modern long distance aircraft (especially airliners) which aim for maximum fuel economy tend to have high bypass ratios. As Mach diamonds are only associated with trans-sonic operation you will not see Mach diamonds from eg a 747. </p>

<p>So, low bypass fanjets <em>may</em> have supersonic exhausts for part of their operation. A turbojet may be sub or super sonic and afterburner will almost always (but not necessarily in theory) produce supersonic outlet flow. </p>

<p>In systems which do have supersonic exit exhaust velocities, as the flow changes from sonic at the nozzle throat to supersonic in the expansion system the aim is to make the exit pressure exactly match ambient. ""Exactly"" never exactly happens in practice. Where the mismatch occurs there will be a shockwave - an ""impedance mismatch in another perspective - and the visible evidence of this are the Mach Diamonds. </p>

<p>As both exhaust pressure and ambient pressure change with conditions there will essentially always be some degree of such shock waves present in ""qualifying"" systems, but more so when the engine operation departs more significantly from the ideal. Smaller versions may not be obvious without careful examination. As the overall system is usually optimised for ""normal"" conditions, afterburner operation is more likely to cause a major pressure mismatch as it deviates from normal use. </p>

<p>An exception would occur if the designers decided they wanted absolutely maximum performance from afterburner under given conditions (so that eg an interceptor could achieve absolute maximum velocity when needed) - in which case the Mach diamonds could be minimised on afterburner and would be more pronounced in normal operation.</p>

"Why do lavatories in modern planes still have ash trays?","6660","","<p>Last week I flew on a modern <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?cx=partner-pub-8297169501225184%3Aa05n2n-tzky&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=PH-XRD&amp;sa=Submit&amp;search_active=1&amp;search=&amp;sheadline=&amp;search_field=datedesc&amp;submit=&amp;siteurl=www.airliners.net%2F&amp;ref=&amp;ss=0j0j1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">B737-700</a>. I noticed that the lavatory was equipped with ashtrays  (both on the inside as on the outside) even with the smoking sign on it. Smoking on airplanes has been banned from quite some time now, so why are lavatories still built where ash trays are provided? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tLsp8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Because in the US (where Boeings are made) it's required by law. <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0fc12bc109640c17d4907e13ea54c4de&amp;node=se14.1.25_1853&amp;rgn=div8"">14 CFR 25.853(g)</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(g) Regardless of whether smoking is allowed in any other part of the
  airplane, lavatories must have self-contained, removable ashtrays
  located conspicuously on or near the entry side of each lavatory door,
  except that one ashtray may serve more than one lavatory door if the
  ashtray can be seen readily from the cabin side of each lavatory
  served.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The law may be different in other jurisdictions, of course. <em>Why</em> the law still exists is another question, but either no one found the time to change it (laws are often very difficult to change once passed) or it was a deliberate decision to keep requiring ashtrays in case someone tries to smoke anyway.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As commenters have noted, the law I quoted requires ashtrays <em>outside</em> the lavatories but it's still common to find them <em>inside</em>. My guess here is that the ones outside comply with the <em>letter</em> of the law, whereas the ones inside comply with the <em>intent</em>, i.e. they're there because if someone does light up, it will be inside the lavatory and not outside in plain view. <a href=""http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2012-08-14/airplane-bathroom-ash-trays-explained"">This 2012 article</a> quotes an anonymous FAA source as saying that people continue to smoke on aircraft so it still makes sense to have them for safety reasons. That raises the question (again) of why the law doesn't fully reflect reality, but that's neither unusual nor unique to aviation.</p>

"Why does manifold pressure increase when you turn on carb heat?","6650","","<p>So everyone knows that carb heat decreases engine performance. Yet when we check the heat during run-up, the manifold pressure increases.</p>

<p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Shouldn't adding carb heat cause the intake air to become hotter and therefore thinner, and cause the manifold pressure to decrease?</p>
","<p>Because <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/pelican/182081-1.html?redirected=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">manifold pressure sucks!</a> Seriously though, the manifold pressure measures how much the engine is <em>able to reduce the pressure</em> between throttle and inlet valve by sucking air into the cylinder.</p>

<p>When you apply carb heat the air gets routed over a heat exchanger that uses some of the excess heat from the exhaust system to heat up the intake air, however the reason it becomes less dense, is because the pressure stays the same. If you look at the so called ideal gas law, you'll notice that pressure is a function of density and temperature, if you have a closed system, where the density can not change, increasing the temperature would indeed increase pressure. This is not a closed system however, so the pressure actually stays more or less the same and the density decreases, and it's not the reason for the manifold pressure increase.</p>

<p>The thinner air leaves the engine with less oxygen to burn and thus it produces less power, the RPM drops, causing the engine to ""suck"" less air into the cylinder, this gives the air more time to sneak passed the throttle, and the manifold pressure rises. For the same reason the manifold pressure rises (slightly) when you reduce the RPM for cruise. Any reduction in RPM, for whatever reason &ndash; engine damage for example &ndash; as long as the throttle doesn't move (or if you have carb ice, which has essentially the same effect as closing the throttle), your manifold pressure will actually rise. Remember, it seems counter-intuitive, but the engine is fighting a battle with the throttle, trying to keep the manifold pressure down by sucking the air out, while the throttle is trying to increase the pressure back to atmospheric by letting air in.</p>

<p>When the throttle is anything but wide open, the situation looks like this (image borrowed from the linked article)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.avweb.com/media/newspics/pp15idle.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">idle power http://www.avweb.com/media/newspics/pp15idle.gif</a></p>

<p>It's related to the fact that the manifold pressure gauge, when the engine is stopped, will read ambient pressure, i.e. 29.92 inHg on a standard day at sea level, which is usually interpreted as ""full throttle"", it doesn't matter how the throttle is positioned. So it's not really showing how much fuel/air mix you're shoving into the engine. In fact, we're not shoving at all, the engine literally sucks it into the cylinder as the piston moves out of the way during the intake stroke. In this particular case with the engine off, it just means that enough air was able to sneak by the throttle and equalize the pressure. It is not flowing nearly fast enough to equalize the pressure as soon as the engine is running though.</p>

"Are there any twin engine aircraft without counter-rotating props?","6598","","<p>All the twins I have checked have counter-rotating blades, so I was wondering if this was true for all twins of if there are any twins that have both blades turning in the same direction.</p>
","<h3>Twin enigned aircrafts without counter-rotating propellers</h3>

<p>A great many twins don't have counter-rotating props:</p>

<p>One such aircraft is the BeechCraft Baron 58, as seen in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnYF1FqZa0g"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube video</a>.</p>

<p>Another aircraft I can think of is the King Air 350.</p>

<p>It is not any more or less common to have one or the other. </p>

<h3>Contra-rotating propellers</h3>

<p>Another interesting solution to the P-factor (prop pulling towards one direction), especially on single engine aircraft is <strong>contra-rotating props</strong>, two propellers on the same shaft that spin in opposite directions.</p>

<p>This is mainly for single engine racer aircraft, but there are multi-engine aircraft known to have it, such as the Soviet Tu-95 Bear bomber.</p>

<p>The pic shown here is a Spitfire Mk. XIV:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqzA1.jpg"" alt=""Spitfire Mk. XIV with contra-rotating props""></p>

<h3>A better explanation of the P-factor</h3>

<p>P-factor is the term for asymmetric propeller loading, that causes the airplane to yaw to the left when at high angles of attack.</p>

<p>Assuming a clockwise rotating propeller it is caused by the descending right side of the propeller (as seen from the rear) having a higher angle of attack relative to the oncoming air, and thus generating a higher air flow and thrust than the ascending blade on the left side, which at the other hand will generate less airflow and thrust. This will move the propellers aerodynamic centre to the right of the planes centreline, thus inducing an increasing yaw moment to the left with increasing angle of attack or increasing power. With increasing airspeed and decreasing angle of attack less right rudder will be required to maintain coordinated flight.</p>

"Why does the lack of a magneto affect engine RPM?","6592","","<p>So I don't have my pilots licence, but I was part of the Australian Air Force Cadets for nearly 8 years (wonderful organisation). During this time I went on a number of flights in Cessna 172's and Cessna 152's. I always noticed that as part of the pre-flight check, the pilot checked both magneto's and this corresponded to a slight RPM drop on the engine.</p>

<p>Why does the lack of a magneto affect engine RPM?</p>
","<p>Firstly, to understand the answer, we need to understand that the Cessna 152's and 172's run a 4 Cylinder, Horizontally-opposed Engine. Each Cylinder has 2 spark plugs, one on the top side of the cylinder head, and one on the bottom side. The spark plug ignites the fuel/air mixture that has been sucked into the engine, and causes a controlled burn to push the piston down the cylinder and turn the crankshaft in turn (hence turning the propeller as it is connected to the end of the crankshaft). </p>

<p>Now, as I've stated, each cylinder has two spark plugs, one connected to the ""left"" magneto, and one connected to the ""right"". If we turn one magneto ""off"" (or ground it to be politically correct), only one spark plug in each cylinder will ""fire"" to ignite the fuel/air mixture. This causes the mixture to have a delayed and less effective burn, meaning that the piston does not get pushed down the cylinder as effectively, meaning the crankshaft will not rotate as fast, and hence, leads to a drop in the Propeller RPM (Revolutions per Minute).</p>

<p>We check the magnetos on the ground to check that;
A. They both work, and the engine won't die if we lose a magneto (we should be able to return to land on the remaining serviceable magneto)
B. We are checking that there is no ""Spark Plug Fouling"". The fuel we use in aviation contains lead, and hence after a time of running the engine at low power settings on the ground, the lead in the fuel will accumulate on the spark plug head (instead of being burnt off when the engine is working under power), and cause the spark plug to let off a limited spark, or completely block the spark, hence again, making our engine less efficient.</p>

"Does the APU consume a lot of fuel compared to a jet engine?","6577","","<p>I would like to know whether the APU of modern commercial airliners consumes more or less fuel than a jet engine. Of course, this will vary between aircraft types, so what comparisons in fuel usage are there on a modern jet such as a B737 or A320? What is the ratio between an engine hourly fuel consumption and the APU hourly consumption?</p>
","<p>To give a comparison with an engine at idle:</p>

<p>On the 737 NG, the <a href=""http://www.b737.org.uk/apu.htm#Pack_Operation"">APU</a> can use <strong>240 lb/hr</strong> when under load. It is rated at 90 kVA, <a href=""http://www.b737.org.uk/generators.htm"">same as the generator</a> on each engine.</p>

<p>The engines can use about <strong>850 lb/hr</strong> <a href=""http://easa.europa.eu/system/files/dfu/3CM032%20-%20CFM56-7B24%20%2809.04.2013%29.pdf"">at idle</a>, which from those figures is about 1/10 of fuel flow at full (takeoff) power. So the engines use about 4 times as much fuel (each) as the APU does to just provide power. Of course these values will vary based on ambient conditions and the load placed on the systems (like the bleed air system).</p>

<p>This is why if a plane has to stop away from the gate for a while, they will shut down the engines and run on the APU.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The aircraft was designed in Poland in response to a Soviet
  requirement for a new agricultural plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agricultural airplanes fly slow and having a shorter span increases the number of (air)fields you can land on. That's probably why they decided using a biplane design.  </p>

<p>The two tanks outside the fuselage could have several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Placing the chemicals further away from the turbine and pilot</li>
<li>Reduce the bending moment at the wing root</li>
<li>Shorter pipes between the tank and the spray nozzles</li>
</ul>

<p>All this, of course, at the cost of a lot of drag. As explained in the image source page, fuel consumption was three times larger than other agricultural airplanes and it had a really bad maneuverability.</p>

"How do paper airplanes create lift if their wings are flat?","6567","","<p>Paper airplanes' wings are completely flat, unlike the droplet shaped curvature of a full sized wing. How does a flat wing generate any lift if both sides have the same air pressure?</p>
","<p>Paper airplanes create lift just like any other airplane. Don't let the wing cross section confuse you; what the air ""sees"" is a different shape.</p>

<p>When a flat plate flows through air at a positive angle of attack, the stagnation point of the flow (where air splits into an upper and a lower flow path) sits slightly below the forward edge of the wing. Now the streamline just above the one which hits the stagnation point has to negotiate the sharp corner of the leading edge, which will cause it to separate from the surface. This creates a small separation bubble which to the streamlines further up looks like a round leading edge, and since the rest of the wing has no curvature, the flow will attach again soon. The bigger the angle of attack gets, the farther back the stagnation point will be and the bigger the separation bubble becomes. At some point, which is promoted by leading edge sweep, the separated flow will not reattach, but produce a vortex, like the vortex which provides lift on delta wings.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NmQjv.jpg"" alt=""Visualisation of the flow around a flat plate at moderate angle of attack""></p>

<p>The picture above is from a simulation; see the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KldLqShzCRM"" rel=""noreferrer"">full video here</a>. Note the red color on the forward part of the upper side: This indicates low local pressure, which is needed to make the outer air negotiate the leading edge plus the separation bubble (see <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/13957/does-the-downwash-created-by-induced-drag-increase-or-decrease-lift/13978#13978"">here</a> for an explanation on the molecular level). In the separation bubble, low pressure is <strong>not</strong> accompanied by high flow speed since the separation turbulence has eaten up most of the kinetic energy.</p>

<p>The actual nose radius of the paper wing does not matter, and it might even be zero (like when you fit razor blades to the leading edge): The air will create its own airfoil shape by padding with separated air what cannot be reached with attached flow.</p>

<p>Paper airplanes have a low enough wing loading that their angle of attack is low and the separation does not become too big. All it needs is a center of gravity at the quarter chord of the wing; that is why you need to fold the piece of paper first.</p>

<p>It is interesting to watch a slightly tail-heavy, delta-shaped paper airplane fly: It will gradually reduce speed and will start to rock its wings when it approaches stall. Once one wing is going down, the sudden increase in its local AoA will increase lift so much that the rolling motion reverses, without noticeable yawing. The delta-shaped flat plate has effective roll damping right into the stall. The lack of yaw is mostly due to the high yaw inertia, but indicates also that drag buildup is moderate at best.</p>

<p>Of course, after a few periods of rocking the nose will drop and it will pick up speed like any well-behaved airplane.</p>

"What is the Alpha protection?","6552","","<p>I was reading <a href=""http://avherald.com/h?article=47d74074&amp;opt=0"">this article</a> and the writer states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An occurrence was reported where an Airbus A321 aeroplane encountered a blockage of two Angle Of Attack (AOA) probes during climb, leading to <strong>activation of the Alpha Protection (Alpha Prot)</strong> while the Mach number increased. The flight crew managed to regain full control and the flight landed uneventfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that got me thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the Alpha protection? </li>
<li>Is it part of other major system (like auto-pilot)?</li>
<li>What can it do?</li>
<li>How is it activated?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Alpha is also called ""Angle of Attack"". It is the angle between the relative wind and the chord line of the wing. When the angle of attack is increased to a certain point, the airflow over the wing is no longer smooth. Turbulence is created after the wing, and it loses lift. This is known as a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/6368/3386"">stall</a>.</p>

<p>""Alpha protection"" is a system which prevents the angle of attack from getting too high. This is done by software monitoring the plane's angle of attack sensor. When a high alpha situation is detected, the software lowers the nose of the plane to maintain high but still safe angle of attack. It also commands full thrust to all engines. This system is designed to prevent pilots from stalling the aircraft and to allow them to get the best possible performance in emergency e.g. in a wind-shear.</p>

<p>This is not part of the autopilot. It is integrated into the flight control computer and activated at all times. Autopilot are functions which fly the plane in a certain way to reduce the pilot's workload in normal situations (e.g. climb to 13,000 feet, turn left to heading 340).</p>

<p>Pilots can opt to turn off such protection systems should it malfunction, or a <em>very</em> special occasion exists where these protections should be switched off, such as performing at an airshow.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Notable Accidents</h1>

<p>In the Airbus, the A320 was the first ""fly-by-wire"" aircraft. During a demonstration flight <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_296"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AF296</a> when showing off the alpha-protection system the pilots took the airplane too low and too slow and disabled the part of the system that should have commanded full thrust. The plane didn't stall but was having too little energy to climb anyway. It crashed gently into the trees.</p>

<p>In an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XL_Airways_Germany_Flight_888T"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">acceptance flight</a>, the pilots were testing the alpha-protection at low altitude. The system should have prevented the plane from pitching too high. However, to the surprise of the crew, it failed. The plane stalled with insufficient altitude to recover. The system did not work because water got into the angle-of-attack probes during previous improper washing procedure, froze during the flight and blocked the probes.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AF447</a>, the system switched to ""alternate law"" and no longer provided stall protection, because the pitot tubes (airspeed sensors) froze over.

"Why are passenger seats not facing backward on an airplane?","6547","","<p>In the event of a crash, facing backward sounds much safer:</p>

<li>Forces are applied on a  much larger surface (your whole back is in contact with the seats, instead of just a seatbelt and maybe the opposite seat)</li>
<li>Most passenger are already in position in case of an unpredicted crash.</li>
<li>Passenger without a seatbelt might have higher survival rate</li>
</ol>

<p>Flying objects would maybe be more dangerous, but</p>

<ol>
<li>What made designers do it this way ?</li>
<li>Is there any plane with such a configuration ?</li>

","<p>You are absolutely correct, <a href=""http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-07-07/news/9101240867_1_seat-belt-rear-facing-aviation-safety"" rel=""noreferrer"">backward facing seats are safer</a>.</p>

<p>But tradition and a subjective feeling of being treated better means that people will prefer to be seated facing forward. Some even claim that they develop motion sickness when sitting backwards. This can indeed be the case for some people in trains with their big windows, but much less so in aircraft.</p>

<p>Just note which seats will be occupied last in a train with lounge/mixed seating.</p>

<p>In order to cram the highest number of passengers into their planes, the airlines would need to convert all seats to the backward orientation, and you can be sure there will be some passengers who will complain. If passenger safety would be important to them, airlines could already use better seatbelts, like the 5-point-harnesses used in gliders and aerobatics planes, but they all use the minimum lap belt which is mandated and nothing more. Convenience and cost always win over safety.</p>

<p>Now I need to mention two caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>If passengers should be seated backwards, the industry needs to develop new seats. It will not be helpful to turn existing seats around - they would collapse at much lower loads than what a backward-sitting human can sustain. However, to fully support these higher loads, seats will be more heavy and possibly even the floor structure needs to be beefed up.</li>
<li>Backward-facing seating will only help in the fraction of cases where deceleration loads are too high for a forward-facing person, but low enough to make the crash survivable. If the plane flies into a mountain or ditches and sinks before people get out, the better seating will not help.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some military transports have backward-facing seats. In some crashes, the survivability rate was seven times higher in those than in forward-facing seats. Early air travel also used mixed seating, e.g. on the Zeppelins or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_Do_X"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dornier Do-X</a>. One airline to use mixed seating was Southwest Airlines with their <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travelbuzz/289369-southwest-love-seats-will-you-miss-them.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">""love seats""</a>, and business jets have mixed seating as standard.

"How much oxygen do commercial airliners carry?","6525","","<p>How much oxygen do commercial airliners carry? Is is enough for every seat to have a 20-30 minute supply, is it a percentage of total flight time (ie 10% of total flight time), or is there a compressor on board?</p>

<p>I would assume the goal of the pilots during depressurization would be to repressurize whether that be by simply lowering altitude or other means. Thus, I would assume (hope) there would be sufficient reserves of O2 to do one or the other.</p>
","<p>The masks are connected to a <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRLf3.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">chemical oxygen generator</a> by a lanyard.  Pulling the mask pulls the lanyard, which pulls a pin from the generator and starts the reaction.  They typically last betweeen about 10 and 20 minutes, more than enough time to get down to 10,000 feet where additional oxygen is not required.</p>

<p>There is no need for a % of flight time since the crew will descend to a safe altitude then divert to the nearest suitable field.  Therefore, the only requirement is to last during the (emergency) descent.</p>

<p>You cannot ""repressurise"" since the cabin altitude will be the same as the external altitude.  The only thing to do is to increase the partial pressure of oxygen by descending.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that the flight crew each have their own, isolated supply from a bottle which lasts significantly longer.  This is so that they can continue to fly if there are fumes in the cockpit.  Cabin crew often have their own, smaller, portable bottles so that they can freely move about the cabin to assist the ""self loading freight"".  </p>

<p>Many's a morning when I would arrive to work feeling, ahem, a little ""under the weather"" and nip into the cockpit for a couple of minutes on 100% oxygen.  Works wonders - and don't worry, they are topped up to full as part of the pre-flight service.</p>

I was really surprised, if not shocked, to actually find row 13 missing on my next passenger flight. (I believe it was a Boeing 737.) Is this really due to superstition about the 13th row? Was it so hard to push aircraft producers to renumber all other seat rows?</p>

<p>I know that people can be absurd about their superstitions. But realistically, the odds that a passenger airplane will crash are minimal. And should it really crash, chances that you'll survive due to being seated in row 12 or 14, as opposed to 13, must be below statistical error.</p>

"How can pilots fly VFR over-the-top in overcast conditions?","6512","","<p>It's apparently legal for pilots to fly over the top of clouds and fly VFR. However, I don't understand how it's possible to do so, especially since there is no visual reference to rely on to ensure that you are heading in the right direction. So, how exactly <em>does</em> this work, are there any limitations on this and is it possible to be done safely?</p>
","<p>Perhaps the most important rule for a VFR pilot is ""see and avoid"" -- be able to see any immediate dangers (other aircraft, buildings, ground) and avoid them. When flying above the clouds, you can certainly see other aircraft and avoid them (as long as you're maintaining required cloud clearances), and the same for buildings. You cannot see the ground but on the presumption that your altitude is well above the ground and not significantly changing, this is not a factor.</p>

<p>As long as you're able to see the horizon, you're unlikely to become disoriented to the point of not actually knowing that the aircraft is or isn't flying straight and level. (Contrast that with flying in the clouds, where it's easy to become spatially disoriented and not be aware that you're starting to dive.) Limitations are basic: it's the PIC's responsibility to follow the regulations.</p>

<p>As to heading in the right direction and navigation in general, VFR flight does not mean one cannot rely on radio aids to navigation. VOR and GPS certainly make navigation very possible while on top, but to get to your question of ""can it be done safely?"" -- I suppose this comes down to a question of how reliable are your electronics and where are the weak spots; is the pilot under flight following or otherwise in contact with ATC, etc. If one were on top and were to lose the electrical system, there's certainly an emergency to be declared. If already in contact with ATC, it's an emergency that can likely be managed with the utmost of safety.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_warning_lights#On_aircraft"">Wikipedia: Aircraft warning lights:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These lights include landing lights, red or white flashing beacons, wingtip strobes, and wingtip navigation lights.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Beacons and strobes are flashing lights.</li>
<li>Beacons may be red or white.</li>
<li>Strobes are wingtip lights. I interpret this as strobes being directional while beacons cover 180°.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/"">Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), 4−3−23. Use of Aircraft Lights:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b. An aircraft anti−collision light system can use
  one or more rotating beacons and/or strobe lights, be
  colored either red or white, and have different (higher
  than minimum) intensities when compared to other
  aircraft. Many aircraft have both a rotating beacon
  and a strobe light system.</p>
  
  <p>d. Prop and jet blast forces generated by large
  aircraft have overturned or damaged several smaller
  aircraft taxiing behind them. To avoid similar results,
  and in the interest of preventing upsets and injuries to
  ground personnel from such forces, the FAA
  recommends that air carriers and commercial
  operators turn on their rotating beacons anytime their
  aircraft engines are in operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Beacons are rotating lights. They're always referred as <em>rotating beacons</em> in the AIM.</li>
<li>Both beacons and strobes can be either red or white.</li>
<li>I take the sentence <em>Many aircraft have both a rotating beacon
and a strobe light system.</em> as beacons being the lower intensity lights which are constantly turned on during engine operation signalling the danger of an aircraft in operation, while the strobes being the higher intensity flashing ligths with the reason of being seen from great distance.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_light#Aviation_navigation_lights"">Wikipedia: Aviation navigation lights</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aircraft navigation lights are placed in a way similar to that of marine vessels, with a red navigation light located on the left wingtip leading edge and a green light on the right wingtip leading edge. A white navigation light is as far aft as possible on the tail or each wing tip.[3] High-intensity strobe lights are located on the aircraft to aid in collision avoidance.[4]</p>
  
  <p>In civil aviation, pilots must keep navigation lights on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights are part of the anti-collision light system, as well as the red rotating beacon.</p>
  
  <p>All aircraft built after 11 March 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on for the duration of the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Beacons are red rotating lights.</li>
<li>Strobes are high-intensity white lights.</li>
<li>Beacons stay on for the duration of the flight including the whole engine run time.</li>
<li>Strobes are added from takeoff until leaving the runway after landing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a clear definition?</p>
","<p>I think there are two points in your question: what is the <em>physical</em> difference between a beacon and a strobe, and what is the <em>operational</em> difference? For the rest of this answer, I'm going to assume that you're asking about an aircraft that has both a beacon and strobes; as you quoted above, it's possible for an aircraft to have neither. I'm also going to assume you're asking for an answer that applies in the US; regulations in other countries may be different.</p>

<p>First, the physical difference is exactly what you've already determined: a beacon is a (relatively) low-intensity rotating red or red/white light; a strobe is a high-intensity flashing white light. (As noted in the comments below, some beacons flash instead of rotating, but they're still lower intensity than a strobe.) This isn't formally defined anywhere (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1"" rel=""nofollow"">14 CFR 1.1</a> doesn't define them) but the information you found in the AIM is exactly how everyone I know uses the terms. It's also how you find those words used on aircraft part sites, e.g. <a href=""http://www.aircraftspruce.com/search/search.php?s=beacon&amp;x=0&amp;y=0"" rel=""nofollow"">beacons</a> and <a href=""http://www.aircraftspruce.com/search/search.php?s=strobe&amp;x=0&amp;y=0"" rel=""nofollow"">strobes</a>. So whatever the 'strict' definition might be, the practical and accepted one is exactly what you've found out.</p>

<p>Second, the operational difference essentially comes down to the question ""when do I have to turn them on?"" and in addition to what you found in the AIM the FAA gave more details as part of <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/pol_adjudication/agc200/interpretations/data/interps/2011/murphy%20-%20%282011%29%20legal%20interpretation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this legal interpretation</a>. The questioner asked two questions about beacons and strobes: when to turn them on, and if they both have to be turned on. The key regulation quoted is <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10.3.7.5"" rel=""nofollow"">14 CFR 91.209</a>, and note that the FAA considers the beacon and the strobes <em>together</em> to form a single ""anticollision system"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] it appears that the strobe light and the rotating beacon are
  part of the same anticollision system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When to turn them on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>91.209(b) requires that an aircraft's anticollision lights be turned
  on once that aircraft's engine is started for the purpose of air
  navigation. As a safety precaution, the anticollision lights should be
  on before starting an engine or causing a propeller or rotor to move.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If both have to be turned on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] because section 91.209(b) does not contain an exception for
  alternative sources of anticollision lighting, turning on the
  anticollision beacon would not relieve a pilot from the requirement to
  turn on the anticollision strobe lights. See § 91.209(b). However, §
  91.209(b), does give the PIC the discretion to turn off the anticollision beacon and/or the anticollision strobe light system if
  the PIC determines that it is in the interests of safety to turn off
  either one or both of these components of the same lighting system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the regulations say you should turn them both on, but as PIC it's up to you to determine if using them is safe or not, and if not then you are allowed to turn (or leave) them off.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, I've always been taught to turn the beacon on before starting the engine because it's there to tell people near the aircraft that the engine is running or about to be running. The strobes should go on any time you need to be highly visible (which is most of the time), but not if using them would blind someone else or even yourself, e.g. taxiing or flying in clouds. The <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/AIM_Basic_4-03-14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">AIM 4-3-23</a> has more details on that, in addition to the parts that you quoted.</p>

"How are wooden aircraft protected from lightning strikes?","6476","","<p>A wooden aircraft is not conductive and if a lightning hits the wood it will instantaneously ignite. How would you protect a wooden aircraft from this occurrence?</p>
","<p>By not flying through thunderstorms. For a small aircraft, the lightning is not the most hazardous part of a cumulonimbus (Cb) cloud system. Mature Cb clouds have huge updrafts underneath them, which can cause enough turbulence to upset most aircraft. Heavy rain and hail is also commonplace underneath Cb clouds. Even the rain can be heavy enough to damage wooden propellers and any components on your leading edge (such as the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25920/what-is-the-difference-between-a-leading-edge-flap-and-a-slat"">leading-edge slats</a> found on the Tiger Moths I fly). Hail can put holes in your canvas, which are expensive to repair - if you manage to get the aircraft home at all. This turbulence and rain persists for a much longer period and across a wider area than the thunderstorm itself.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the chief protection against thunderstorms is by training and procedure: student pilots are taught to avoid Cb clouds when they're visible, and to plan flights to avoid areas where Cb are forecast. Weather forecasts and reports specially call out Cb clouds to help with this, and ATIS messages often warn of ""cumulonimbus cloud in the vicinity of the aerodrome"".</p>

<p>Protecting a wooden aircraft specifically against lightning is not hugely worthwhile, because it's unlikely to be able to stay in the vicinity of the Cb cloud for long enough to be at risk of a lightning strike. It just wooden happen.</p>

"What is the procedure when an aircraft with an emergency can't land due to a blocked runway?","6457","","<p>This is a hypothetical scenario, but I'm interested to know if there are any regulations/guidance for what ATC should do in this situation.</p>

<p>The hypothetical nightmare scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>The runway is blocked by a crashed airliner and can't be cleared quickly.</li>
<li>The airliner is full of injured passengers who will take time to move.</li>
<li>The next aeroplane in line to land has an engine failure and is gliding to the runway (so can't go around).</li>
<li>You're in a hilly/built-up area so other options for landing are limited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the options I can come up with (in roughly ascending order of how crazy they sound):</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch him to a different runway e.g. LHR has two parallel runways (but if he's close to the airport making the sudden move across to another runway might be dangerous without power?)</li>
<li>Empty a taxiway (but you'd probably struggle to empty it fast enough at a busy airport?)</li>
<li>Point him towards a grassy bit of the airport</li>
<li>Allow him to land, but aim to land before or after the crashed aircraft (crash is probably at start or end of runway, so might just work)</li>
<li>Wish him good luck and tell him to find somewhere else to land (you know that's possibly going to result in him crashing, but at least he won't crash into the already crashed aircraft).</li>
</ul>

<p>So is there any advice for the controller and if so what is it?</p>

<hr>

","<p>What's the procedure? The procedure is, <strong>be creative to save as many lives as possible!</strong></p>

<p>Really. The procedure is to determine a course of action which will likely result in the best outcome for everyone, utilizing all resources and given all constraints. Period. It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>There are infinitely many scenarios, and one cannot be trained for everything. However, pilots and controllers are trained to remain calm. When we look at the accident report years later, reading the document, we can easily say ""<em>if the pilots had done that, people would have been saved...</em>"". The important thing is that the people who were responsible at the time had to <strong>remain calm enough</strong> to <strong>look at the big picture</strong> instead of focusing on a particular problem, otherwise they can easily overlook a solution.</p>

<p>During training, it is common to throw multiple failures / emergencies together. The purpose is not to train the trainee to react to this exact combination of failure, since that is rather unlikely. Rather, the purpose is to simulate a stressful environment, under which one has to make sound and logical decisions.</p>

"Why don't we have yokes that look like steering wheels?","6455","","<p>This question came across my mind when I was thinking about cockpit design vs car design: why don't we have yokes that look like steering wheels?</p>

<p>The first advantage I can think of is more gestures to hold the yoke. You can hold a steering wheel in many ways, e.g. 2 &amp; 10 o'clock, 3 &amp; 9 o'clock, top, bottom, one hand, both hands etc. And one can still pull or push the yoke even if it's circular.</p>

<p>Secondly, in most (if not all) of the yokes, full aileron deflection is achieved when the yoke is rotated approximately 90 degrees. Would it be beneficial if it's 180 degree instead, allowing more fine control?</p>
","<p>Short answer: <strong>Because you only use one hand on the yoke.</strong></p>

<p>Longer answer: In an airplane, you almost always fly with only one hand on the yoke (or none, as the case may be.) You will be using your other hand for power adjustments, setting flaps, adjusting radios, setting instruments, writing, etc.</p>

<p>In a car, power is adjusted with your feet, so you don't need your second hand for power adjustments and there aren't really any other particularly critical controls that need to be manipulated frequently or precisely. However, in an airplane, you have to be able to precisely control <strong>three</strong> axes of rotation, not just one like in a car. As such, your feet are needed for yaw control (and differential braking,) which means power must instead be controlled by hand. So, there's no need for the various grip positions that you could use with a wheel because you don't want your second hand on the yoke in the first place.</p>

<p>Additionally, having a 90-degree angle (or nearly so, as the case may be) allows for a better grip than the smooth curve of a steering wheel. You can place 2 or 3 fingers above the horizontal bar and the others below, which prevents your hand from slipping up or down the control wheel, as is possible with a normal car steering wheel.</p>

<p>As far as the second question of whether it would be better to have 180 degrees equal full deflection, that would mean you would either need 2 hands on the yoke in order to command full deflection, which is not good for the reasons already mentioned, or have a weaker grip on the yoke that would allow you to rotate it 180 degrees either direction. If you have a firm grip on the yoke, your wrist will simply not be able to rotate enough to turn it upside down without releasing your grip.</p>

<p>It's also important to note the difference here between what the yoke controls versus what a car steering wheel controls. A car steering wheel directly controls your turn rate. Thus, a car whose steering wheel is in the neutral position will not be turning. In an airplane, however, your current bank angle controls your turn rate. An aileron deflection changes your bank angle. Having the ailerons in the neutral position will not cause you to fly straight forwards, but rather will simply leave your bank angle (and thus your turn rate) at its present value (<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/17019/755"">if we ignore the effects of dihedral and such</a>.) Thus, you don't need as much possible input control range to get precise turn rate control.</p>

"Why should you not turn in the direction of an inoperative engine?","6426","","<p>In two-engine aircraft with wing-mounted engines when one engine quits the aircraft will have a natural tendency to turn <em>to</em> the dead engine. So if you need to turn, it seems logical it should be easier to turn that way.</p>

<p>However in <a href=""http://avherald.com/h?article=47897aae"">the discussion here</a> is a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sub>By dinger on Monday, Aug 11th 2014 13:42Z:</sub><br>
  SOP in a twin is NOT to turn in the direction of the failed engine. Right engine failed and they turned Right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it really standard procedure, and if it is, what is the reason behind it?</p>
","<p>The AvHerald comment is correct, you generally do not want to turn towards the dead engine. The aircraft will tend to turn (both yaw and bank) towards the dead engine due to asymmetric thrust, allowing it to do so at low speed will make it difficult to <em>end the turn</em>, possibly to the point where you lose control. If you turn away from the dead engine, you'll have a tougher time getting <em>into</em> the turn, but the live engine will help you get out of it. That said, attempting low altitude turns with an engine out seems like a bad idea, you should concentrate on going straight and maintaining optimum airspeed to make sure you get some altitude</p>

<p>There are a couple of mnemonics when dealing with engine failures, like ""dead foot, dead engine"" (determining which engine failed) and ""raise the dead"" (keep bank towards the live engine)</p>

<p>I can only speculate as to why they chose to go right, either they wanted to avoid the populated area, or they were already unable to control the turn. The high density altitude would certainly affect the OEI performance as well, perhaps luring them into losing airspeed below Vmc.</p>

<p>First, the standard guard frequency is 121.5 or 243.0 MHz. If you aren't listening to this frequency and get intercepted, you should start listening.</p>

<p>Methods like LED signs or possibly as whiteboard as you suggested can also be used. Otherwise, they maneuver their aircraft to send standard signals. See the guides above for details on the signals sent by interceptors and how they should be acknowledged. Basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have been intercepted, follow me
<ul>
<li>Interceptor: Rocks wings (and flashes lights irregularly at night)</li>
<li>Intercepted: Same</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You may proceed
<ul>
<li>Interceptor: Breakaway, climbing turn away from aircraft</li>
<li>Intercepted: Rocking wings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Land here
<ul>
<li>Interceptor: Circling airport, lowering landing gear, overflying runway (landing lights on at night)</li>
<li>Intercepted: Lower gear, land</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The intercepted aircraft can also send signals. The interceptor will respond with one of the signals above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Designated airport is inadequate
<ul>
<li>Intercepted: Raise gear, flash landing lights</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cannot comply
<ul>
<li>Intercepted: Switching on and off all lights, but distinct from flashing lights</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In distress
<ul>
<li>Intercepted: Irregular flashing of all lights</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of the Washington, DC Special Flight Rules Area (DC SFRA), there is a Visual Warning System (VWS) of red and green lights that will let the pilot know that they shouldn't be there. The pilot is supposed to turn directly away from the center of the SFRA. If they are in contact with ATC they must advise that they have been illuminated by the system, otherwise they should contact ATC on a guard frequency and identify themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, an interceptor can't <em>force</em> an intercepted aircraft follow instructions. It goes on to explain what will happen if you don't follow those rules, which probably apply in any situation where the risk is too high:</p>

  <p>Further noncompliance with interceptor aircraft or ATC may result in the use of force. </p>

"Could this ""Wingless Dodo"" fly in real life?","6353","","<p>There is a wingless Cessna in GTA 3 that is so impossible to fly that the game counts how many seconds you manage to fly it.</p>

<p>Would that plane fly at least 1 second in real life?<br>
The plane looks like a C152.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7kIq3ucVug"" rel=""noreferrer"">video where that plane appears</a>.</p>
","<p>The minimum speed of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_152#Specifications_.28Cessna_152.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cessna 152</a> is 43 knots while the maximum speed is 110 knots. If the wing area is reduced to one half of its original size, and we accelerate to twice the minimum speed, the induced drag is half as much as that of the original airplane at minimum speed (but still eight times higher than that of the original airplane at the same speed!).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dynamic pressure scales with the square of airspeed, so it grows by a factor of four.</p></li>
<li><p>Lift coefficient and aspect ratio are half as much as before,</p></li>
<li><p>so the induced drag (which scales with lift coefficient squared over aspect ratio) is only half as much.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now to friction drag: If the surface area would remain unchanged, the doubling of speed quadruples the friction drag. Since friction drag is dominant at high speed and the original engine and propeller managed to overcome that drag at 110 knots, it would at most be 61% of that drag at 86 knots. Engine power is constant over speed and thrust proportional to the inverse of speed, so the excess thrust at 86 knots would be 28% higher than at maximum speed, leaving an excess thrust for induced drag and acceleration of at least 67%, which should easily be sufficient for takeoff (if the runway is long enough).</p>

<p>I would only be worried about the lack of ailerons - they have been cut off with the outer wing as well.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the clipped version should be capable of a higher maximum speed, but that would most likely be limited by tail flutter and dropping propeller efficiency.</p>

<p>While clipping half the wing will still render the result somewhat flyable, if more than half of the wing is clipped, I would start to doubt that it can be brought into the air without further modifications.</p>

<p>When the Luftwaffe tried to train pilots for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_163_Komet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Me-163</a>, they turned to gliders with clipped wings, so their minimum speed would more closely resemble that of the rocket-powered interceptor.

<p>Doesn't the turbofan push the bypass air back really fast providing thrust?  How do each of the these propellers (turbo prop and turbofan) produce thrust?</p>
","<p>The cross section of propeller blade is an airfoil. As the propeller rotates through the air, it generates lift, which becomes thrust as the it is directed forwards rather than vertically upwards as in aircraft wing.</p>

<br><sup>Source: recreationalflying.com</sup></p>

<p>The <em>relative airflow</em> on the blade section (airfoil) is the resultant vector of two things - the forward motion of the propeller (the aircraft) and the rotational velocity of the propeller blade itself. Most of the propellers in use today are fixed speed variable pitch propellers. So, velocity experienced by the propeller blade is maximum at the tip (where the rotational speed is maximum) and minimum at the hub.</p>

<sup>Source: americanflyers.net</sup></p>

<p>So, at any RPM, different parts of the propeller are at different angles of attack. To remedy this, the airfoil sections are varied along the propeller. So the propeller is practically <em>twisted</em> along its length, with the root at higher angle of attack. Also, in some cases, the airfoils are changed along the length (thinner ones are near tip).</p>

<p>As already noted, the pitch of the propeller blades can be varied in flight. What the photo shows is a <em>feathered</em> propeller i.e. a propeller that is set parallel to the airflow. This is done usually in order to reduce drag in case of engine failure. During normal operation, the blades will not be in feathered position. For example, in the figure below, the propeller of engine 1 feathered while the next one is not.</p>

<br><sup>From wikimedia commons, work by Julian Herzog</sup></p>

<p>In aircraft, propeller pitch is changed with speed, with fine pitch at low speeds and strong acceleration (like takeoff) and a coarse pitch for high speed (cruise).</p>

<p><strong>Thrust</strong> The thrust in both turboprop and turbofan is provided by accelerating air through fans. In a turboprop, it the propeller, while it is the bypass fan in case of the turbofan.</p>

<p>The thrust produced, T is given by,</p>

<p>$T = \dot {m} * (v_{f} - v_{0})$,</p>

<p>where $\dot{m}$ the mass flow rate of air and $v_{f}$ and $v_{0}$ are the final and initial (unaccelerated) velocities of the air respectively. Usually case of propellers, the mass flow rate $\dot {m}$ is higher, while in case of turbofans, the variation in velocity is comparatively higher.</p>

"How do I use the FAA's WINGS program as a flight review?","6338","","<p>I know pilots can substitute WINGS phases for the Flight Review otherwise required every two years. How do I do this? Do I have to attend a class to meet all the equivalency requirements?</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://www.faasafety.gov/WINGS/pub/learn_more.aspx"">FAA Safety Team's WINGS program</a> allows pilots to bypass the traditional <a href=""http://rgl.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/8E5FD1956A15733586256959004BB274?OpenDocument"">FAR 61.56</a> flight review by completing a ""phase"" of the WINGS program.  The program and requirements are detailed in FAA Advisory Circular 61-91 <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ac%2061-91j.pdf"">(currently 61-91J)</a>.</p>

<p>The short version is that a ""phase"" of WINGS consists of three credits of ""flight activities"" and three credits of ""knowledge activities"", which must be earned with a 12 calendar month period.</p>

<p>Flight credits are earned by flying with an instructor and demonstrating safe &amp; proficient flying skills in specific areas of operation.<br>
For example, one ""Basic WINGS"" flight activity (worth 1 credit) is demonstrating basic air work - forward slips, steep turns, rectangular course, S-turns, and turns around a point - to Private Pilot practical test standards.<br>
When you have successfully completed a flight activity your instructor can log in to the FAA Safety / WINGS site and give you credit for completing the activity.</p>

<p>Knowledge credits are earned by attending seminars and classes - these can be <a href=""https://faasafety.gov/SPANS/events/EventList.aspx"">in-person seminars set up by the FAA Safety Team</a>, or on-line webinars.  Many of the <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/asf/online_courses/"">AOPA Air Safety Institute online courses</a> qualify for WINGS credit.</p>

<p>When you complete a phase of wings your flight review clock resets, and your flight review becomes due 24 calendar months from the date you completed that phase.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ultimately participating in the WINGS program probably means you will be spending <em>more</em> than the ""bare minimum"" 1 hour of ground time and 1 hour of flight time that FAR 61.56 requires. While you can often complete flight activities in an hour (or much less if you're proficient) the knowledge topics often take longer: the webinars are typically 30-40 minutes each, and in-person seminars can easily last an hour or more.  </p>

<p>The major benefit to the WINGS program is increased safety through building your knowledge and proficiency - the seminars are actually informative (and the in-person ones can even be fun, depending on who is running them), and the flight activities are pretty easy (though there are certainly challenging ones available if you want to push yourself and really sharpen your skills). Resetting the flight review is an enticement to encourage all of us to participate.</p>

"Why can't I build an entire jet engine out of carbon fiber?","6329","","<p>I noticed that most jet engines are made out of aluminum or metal components. However, carbon fiber has a melting point of 3500 degrees celcius, way above metal or aluminum. So, can I build an entire jet engine out of carbon fiber?</p>
","<p>No, you can not. Carbon fibre composites always contain a matrix component which serves different functionalities, but (in a micro nutshell) bonds and keeps the fibres in place. What you get is a very complex material with lots of lightweight potential, but also very different property profiles compared to metals.</p>

<p>Most matrix materials (thermoset, thermoplastics) will not work up to engine (combustion chamber) temperatures and either degrade/burn or melt/vaporize/burn long before reaching even a meagre few hundred Kelvin (say, 500K). In fact, carbon fibres will not work as well in an oxygenated high-temperature environment, and degrade/burn up as well.</p>

<p>One composite material that works and is used already in engines are ceramic matrix composites, like (amongst others) e.g. C/C-SiC structures, but those are very special animals (and even there the carbon fibre parts are susceptible to burn). Especially in terms of mechanical properties, these cannot compete with superalloys.</p>

<p>But also for many other, ambient temperature parts, metals are much better suited. Think of example of a ball bearing - doing that completely in composite will not work really well (if at all).</p>

"Why do low wing aircraft have higher dihedral than high wing aircraft?","6287","","<p>I have noticed and read in books that low wing aircraft have higher dihedral than high wing aircraft. Dihedral is design feature for lateral stability so should be needed for both designs. So why is it more pronounced in low wing designs?</p>
","<p>There are several sources for a sideslip-induced rolling moment:</p>

<ol>
<li>The dihedral angle $\nu$ of the wing, which will increase the local angle of attack $\alpha$ on the windward wing according to $\Delta\alpha = \beta\cdot sin\nu$; $\beta$ being the angle of sideslip,</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/6285/an-225-wing-configuration"">sweep angle $\varphi$ of the wing</a>, which in a sideslip causes a de-sweeping of the airflow over the windward wing (and an increased sweep effect on the leeward wing). The local change in angle of attack is $\Delta\alpha = (cos(\varphi±\beta)-cos\varphi)\cdot(\alpha-\alpha_0)$ and is proportional to the angle of attack,</li>
<li>The crossflow around the fuselage (see sketch below for illustration, sorry, no simple formula here), and</li>
<li>The location of the vertical tail, or more precisely, the side force created on it by a sideslip angle in relation to the location of the center of gravity. This effect dictated the anhedral of aircraft like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-104_Starfighter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F-104 Starfighter</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please see <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7980/in-a-slip-or-skid-how-does-one-wing-have-a-higher-angle-of-attack-and-more-lift/7983#7983"">this answer</a> for a more complete explanation of effect 3. The sketch below is taken from the linked answer and shows a high and a low wing configuration in sideslip. The thin blue arrows indicate the sideways component of airflow $v_{\infty}\cdot sin\beta$.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ogOgZ.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>In the end, some rolling due to sideslip is good, but too much must be avoided, and dihedral is used to complement the other effects such that the total is just right. A high wing already provides some positive rolling moment due to sideslip (negative $c_{l_{\beta}}$: When you deflect rudder to the left, the resulting sideslip should roll the aircraft to the left, too), so the wing doesn't need to contribute as much (by means of dihedral) as in low wing aircraft.</p>

<p>Dihedral (or for that matter, even a low center of gravity) will not roll the aircraft level: There is no aerodynamic way to achieve that! Dihedral will only give you a rolling moment when the aircraft sideslips.</p>

But <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2013/June/26/aircraft-maintenance-propeller-care"">according to AOPA</a>, it is not a good thing:</p>

"How complete is our understanding of lift?","6230","","<p>I'm currently studying for my PPL and one of the accepted textbooks contains the following disclaimer at the end of the Principles of Flight section on lift:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to note that the forgoing explanation of lift, and its reliance on Bernoulli's theorem, is very much the 'classical' theory of lift production and the one on which the exam questions are usually based. There are differences of opinion amongst scientists on the subject....[snip]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same book previously also describes the venturi theory which NASA discredits.</p>

<p>Additionally, one of my previous CFI's told me that during a previous successful job interview he had been asked to explain lift and had merely responded with ""Which theory would you like me to cover?""</p>

<p>On the contrary - we must have an excellent understand of some components because of the way we're able to design and build such stable (and unstable when we want) aircraft. Plus, I see some absolutely incredible mathematics described on this website which seek to accurately answer complex questions.</p>

<p>So, my question isn't how is lift generated -it's how complete is our understanding? Which bits are still in dispute, and which bits are fully accepted?</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes, our understanding of lift is complete, but solving the equations for some practical cases needs more resources than what is technically sensible.</p>

<h2>Lift is a matter of definition</h2>

<p>First of all, lift is only one part of the aerodynamic forces. It is the component normal to the direction of airflow. Since the aircraft will distort the local flow around itself, this direction is taken ideally at an infinite distance where the air is undisturbed.</p>

<p>The other component is, of course, drag. It is defined as the part of the aerodynamic forces parallel to the direction of airflow.</p>

<p>The aerodynamic forces are the sum of all local pressures, which act orthogonally on the local surface of the airplane, and the shear forces, which act parallel to the local surface.</p>

<p>When aerodynamics was researched first, electric fields were new and exciting, and the same equations which help to calculate electromagnetic forces could be used to calculate aerodynamic forces. Therefore, abstract concepts like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_flow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sources or sinks</a> were used to explain aerodynamics. This made it not easier to understand, and many authors tried to find simpler explanations. Unfortunately, they were mostly too simple and not correct, but the next generation of authors would mostly copy what had been written before, so the wrong concepts were still bandied about.</p>

<p>To get to the bottom of it, it might help to look at lift at a molecular level:</p>

<p>Every air molecule is in a dynamic equilibrium between inertial, pressure and viscous effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inertial means that the mass of the particle wants to travel on as before and needs force to be convinced otherwise.</li>
<li>Pressure means that air particles oscillate all the time and bounce into other air particles. The more bouncing, the more force they exert on their surroundings.</li>
<li>Viscosity means that air molecules, because of this oscillation, tend to assume the speed and direction of their neighbors.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three contributions are well understood, and with the Navier-Stokes equations they can be completely mathematically expressed. What is still improving is our ability to solve these equations, and in turbulent flow the characteristic length required to capture all effects is so small that it is practically impossible to solve those equations fully with finite time and resources.</p>

<h2>Flow over the upper side of the wing</h2>

<p>Now to the airflow: When a wing approaches at subsonic speed, the low pressure area over its upper surface will suck in air ahead of it. See it this way: Above and downstream of a packet of air we have less bouncing of molecules (= less pressure), and now the undiminished bouncing of the air below and upstream of that packet will push its air molecules upwards and towards that wing. The packet of air will rise and accelerate towards the wing and be sucked into that low pressure area. Due to the acceleration, the packet will be stretched lengthwise and its pressure drops in sync with it picking up speed. Spreading happens in flow direction - the packet is distorted and stretched lengthwise, but contracts in the direction orthogonally to the flow. Once there, it will ""see"" that the wing below it curves away from its path of travel, and if that path would remain unchanged, a vacuum between the wing and our packet of air would form. Reluctantly (because it has mass and, therefore, inertia), the packet will change course and follow the wing's contour. This requires even lower pressure, to make the molecules overcome their inertia and change direction. This fast-flowing, low-pressure air will in turn suck in new air ahead and below of it, will go on to decelerate and regain its old pressure over the rear half of the wing, and will flow off with its new flow direction.</p>

<p>Note that lift can only happen if the upper contour of the wing will slope downwards and away from the initial path of the air flowing around the wing's leading edge. This could either be camber or angle of attack - both will have the same effect. Since camber allows for a gradual change of the contour, it is more efficient than angle of attack.</p>

<h2>Flow over the lower side of the wing</h2>

<p>A packet of air which ends up below the wing will experience less uplift and acceleration, and in the convex part of highly cambered airfoils it will experience a compression. It also has to change its flow path, because the cambered and/or inclined wing will push the air below it downwards, creating more pressure and more bouncing from above for our packet below the wing. When both packets arrive at the trailing edge, they will have picked up some downward speed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V7Ujo.png"" alt=""Airfoil in wind tunnel with smoke trails indicating flow""></p>

<p>Behind the wing, both packets will continue along their downward path for a while due to inertia and push other air below them down and sideways. Above them, this air, having been pushed sideways before, will now fill the space above our two packets. Macroscopically, this looks like two big vortices. But the air in these vortices cannot act on the wing anymore, so it will not affect drag or lift. See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8877/how-does-an-aircraft-form-wake-turbulence/8882#8882"">here for more on that effect</a>, including pretty pictures.</p>

<h2>Lift can be explained in several, equivalent ways</h2>

<p>Following the picture of a pressure field outlined above, lift is the difference of pressure between upper and lower surface of the wing. The molecules will bounce against the wing skin more at the lower side than at the upper side, and the difference is lift.</p>

<p>Or you look at the macroscopic picture: A certain mass of air has been accelerated downwards by the wing, and this required a force to act on that air. This force is what keeps the aircraft up in the air: Lift.</p>

<p>If you look at the wing as a black box and only pay attention to the impulse of the inflowing and outflowing air, the wing will change the impulse by adding a downward component. The reaction force of this impulse change is lift.</p>

<p>Either way, you will arrive at the same result. By the way: Most of the directional change happens in the forward part of the airfoil, not at the trailing edge!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGhZF.png"" alt=""streamlines around a wing and direction of impulses""></p>

<h2>Supersonic flow</h2>

<p>When the aircraft moves faster than pressure changes propagate through air, the changes in pressure are no longer smooth, but sudden. The aircraft will push the air molecules aside, producing a compression shock. Behind the shock front pressure, temperature and density are higher than ahead of it, and the increase is proportional to the local change in flow direction. The incremental pressure change $\delta p$ due to the aircraft hitting air with an incremental angle of $\delta\vartheta$, expressed in terms of the undisturbed flow with the index $\infty$, is proportional to the change in the streamlines:
$$\delta p = -\frac{\rho_{\infty}\cdot v^2_{\infty}}{\sqrt{Ma^2_{\infty} - 1}}\cdot\delta\vartheta$$</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gas pressure on a molecular level is the number and severity of particle collisions</a>. The air molecules experience more collisions on the downstream side of the shock, since air pressure is higher there. The average  direction of the additional collisions is indeed orthogonal to the shock, because it is the boundary between blissfully unaware molecules at ambient pressure ahead of the shock and their bruised brethren downstream which have just crossed that boundary. Once a molecule has passed the shock, the collisions are coming again equally from all sides and its speed does not change any more.</p>

<p>If the surface curves away from the local flow direction, the air produces an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Meyer_expansion_fan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">expansion fan</a> which re-sets the old pressure and density values when the air flows again in its original direction.</p>

<p>Pure supersonic lift is only a matter of the angle of incidence, and any local curvature of the wing will not change overall lift (but increase drag). Now the total aerodynamic force is normal to the wing, and drag will become proportional to the angle of incidence. In hypersonic flow you will get good results with the venerable impact theory first formulated by Isaac Newton.</p>

<h2>Separated flow</h2>

<p>This happens when the air molecules are <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/5048/why-does-supersonic-flight-detach-airflow-from-a-wing/5055#5055"">no longer able to follow the contour of the aircraft</a>. Instead, you get a chaotic, oscillating flow pattern which is very hard to compute exactly. This is really the only part of aerodynamics which cannot be predicted precisely, even though the effects are well understood. Separated flow will produce lift, too, but less than attached flow. In delta wings, this separation is produced on purpose to create what is called <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21069/what-is-vortex-lift/21071?s=1%7C0.4663#21071"">vortex lift</a>.</p>

"Where does the final approach segment begin on an ILS approach?","6217","","<p>Where does the final approach segment begin on an ILS approach? It may not be as simple as it sounds to answer. The reason I ask is because I've found some support for at least two answers.</p>

<p>One is that final begins when passing the glide slope intercept point a the last no lower than altitude for the approach. This is the point denoted by the lightning bolt arrow on government charts.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/HBJfCAh.png"" alt=""glide slope intercept""></p>

<p>Another answer I've heard is that it begins when glide slope has be intercepted within the limitations of the glide slope and on an approach segment. For the example plate above, this would mean that if the glide slope were intercepted between SILKY and JAKOR the pilot would be considered to be past the final approach fix for all intents and purposes and might even configure the airplane for landing at that point rather than passing JAKOR at the published glide slope intercept.</p>

<p>I think there are valid arguments for both, but I'd apprecate more insight and references on the topic.</p>
","<p>No arguments needed, it's very specifically defined. According to the FAA's <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/PCG.pdf"">Pilot/Controller Glossary</a> under <em>SEGMENTS OF AN INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. Final Approach− The segment between the final approach fix or point
  and the runway, airport, or missed approach point. (See ICAO term
  FINAL APPROACH SEGMENT.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it starts at the FAF, which is defined in the same document as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FINAL APPROACH FIX− The fix from which the final approach (IFR) to an
  airport is executed and which identifies the beginning of the final
  approach segment. It is designated on Government charts by the Maltese
  Cross symbol for nonprecision approaches and the lightning bolt
  symbol, designating the PFAF, for precision approaches; or when ATC directs a
  lower-than-published glideslope/path or vertical path intercept
  altitude, it is the resultant actual point of the glideslope/path or
  vertical path intercept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your example, that means the final approach segment starts at JAKOR. I may be wrong here, but your original thought might have been that the final approach starts when you're established on the glideslope, which could be outside JAKOR. That makes sense in a general way, but it isn't how the term is defined.</p>

","<p>The blades are loose in their ""Fir Tree"" blade mounts so that they can self balance. They are called ""fir tree"" because they are v shaped.   </p>

<p>As the rotation speed and centrifugal force increases, they move in the mounts and establish individual lead/lag positions to achieve a balanced disc. </p>

  <p>It will be understood that turbine wheels rotate at very high speeds

Requesting and receiving a VFR-on-top clearance doesn't cancel the IFR flight plan.</p>

<p>When is this clearance useful? It allows the pilot a greater choice of cruising altitudes, but why would a pilot prefer to use VFR-on-top rather than request a different IFR altitude? VFR-on-top adds at least one task to the pilot's workload - maintaining VFR cloud clearance - without reducing the IFR workload.</p>
","<p>The VFR on top clearance is often given with a block of altitudes.  Such as this from the reference document ""Maintain VFR-on-top at or between six thousand and one zero thousand.”  With this clearance the pilot can fly any altitude they want within this block of altitudes without having to contact ATC for further clearance.  This flexibility can be useful with the conditions are such that the clouds come and go as you fly along.  So if you are cruising along at 6500 and encounter a cloud and need to climb to 8500 to maintain clearance you just do it.  No need to contact ATC and wait for them to ensure they can clear you higher while the clouds keeps getting bigger and bigger in the windshield. </p>

"Why is a higher bypass ratio more efficient at lower speeds?","6210","","<p>Why is it that a larger volume of air moving slower is a more efficient means of propulsion than a smaller volume of air moving faster?  (This is true up to a given speed, obviously, as supersonic aircraft use lower BPR engines).</p>
","<p>Because bigger reaction mass with lower speed carries away less energy for the same momentum.</p>

<p>To produce <em>thrust</em> the engine applies force to the exhaust gasses and air. This force accelerates the air. To produce thrust $F$, the engine has to impart momentum $p = \frac{F}{t}$ per unit of time on the air. Momentum is proportional to mass and first order of speed. $p = mv$ where $m$ is mass of the gasses (reaction mass) affected by the engine per unit of time and $v$ is speed of those gasses.</p>

<p>The gasses however also take away some kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is also proportional to mass, but also to <em>second</em> order of speed. $E_k = \frac12mv^2$.</p>

<p>This energy has to be provided by the engine. Since the fuel can only provide so much energy (it's heating value) per unit of mass, an engine that needs less energy needs less fuel. And that is achieved by moving more air. Which means higher bypass ratio for jet and bigger propeller for engines with propellers.</p>

<p>Note, that this does not say high-bypass engine would be more efficient at slow speed than at high speed. Because it isn't. All jet engines are more efficient at high speed. This is because the <em>power</em> the engine produces is $P = Fv$. So at high speed, larger part of the power output is the useful work moving the aircraft.</p>

<p>In high-bypass engine the maximum power output of the fan is limited though (similar to propeller), so compared to a turbojet the difference in efficiency is higher at low speed.</p>

"What's the appropriate course of action if an airliner bounces 5-10 feet on touchdown?","6204","","<p>I regularly fly in a PC flight simulator, and I'm currently trying to refine landings in medium-to-large airliners in various weather conditions.</p>

<p>A problem I've faced in some conditions while flying the 737-800 has been bouncing on touchdown, where I lose just enough lift in the last few feet of my approach to touch down firmly on the main gear only, before bouncing back up 5-10 feet.</p>

<p>While I'm already looking into avoiding this kind of bounce whenever possible, I'd like to know what common procedures are in this situation assuming the gear is left intact and there's no urgent failures or factors (such as a fuel emergency) which would time-constrain a landing. Specifically; would a real-world flight in this situation go around, adjust thrust, adjust flare, or do something else entirely?</p>
","<p>Well, ""5 to 10 feet"" is not ""slightly.""  One or two feet is ""slightly,"" and in that case you can maintain your landing attitude or pitch very slightly nose-down -- really a matter of the slightest change in pressure, not really a perceptible change in pitch -- and you'll land soon after that.</p>

<p>However, for a larger bounce, the concern, especially on the longer 737's, the -800 and -900 and -900ER, is a tail-strike. The tail skid protects the tail from a strike on takeoff, but on landing the geometry is different and the skid won't be what contacts the runway; it will be the fuselage.  And while tail strikes on takeoff are more common, it's the tail strikes on landing that are far more damaging &amp; expensive. So avoiding one of those is a major concern.  Thus, the usual guidance in the event of a bounced landing in the 737-800 is not to attempt to salvage the landing, but rather to go around.  You may touch down again during the go-around, and that's okay, but you're better off aborting the landing &amp; taking it around to try again, than to risk damaging the aircraft by trying to recover from a high bounce.</p>

<p>One thing that complicates recovering from a bounce is the fact that your spoilers may have extended when you touched down the first time -- and the last ten feet to the runway with spoilers fully extended &amp; power already at idle, won't look nearly the same as the usual last ten feet to the runway, with power coming off &amp; no spoilers. You'll settle fast, and hard, and you won't have the elevator authority you're used to for adjusting the sink rate.  You can pull back, but the change in attitude probably won't arrest the sink rate the way you think it will -- you'll just hit harder &amp; in a more nose-high attitude.  Thus the increased risk of hitting the tail.</p>

<p>On a shorter aircraft without the tail-strike concerns (say a 737-200,  -300, -500, -600, or -700), it <em>might</em> be possible to salvage the bounced landing, although 10 feet up is a pretty high bounce -- even if you had a lot of airspeed to play with and runway ahead of you, I'm not sure it would be wise trying to sort that situation out -- go around &amp; try again.</p>

"What are the major drivers of cost/price differences between Cessna 172 and Piper Cherokee?","6194","","<p>This may be closed as opinionated but I'm looking for answers with hard data if I can get them. The Cessna 172 and Piper Cherokee are touted as two of the most successful light aircraft designs in the world, and they are primary competitors, with Piper originally designing the PA-28 Cherokee to be a lower-cost version of the Comanche that would compete directly with the 172 of the day.</p>

<p>However, in today's new market, a 2015 Cessna costs about \$370k, while Piper Archers (the continuation of the PA-28 airframe after Piper's corporate restructure) made in the last 10 years or so are selling for about \$200k. Cessna also seems to hold more value; ""classic"" 172 airframes from the 70s and 80s hold about a \$100k value in classified ads, while flight-ready Cherokees from the same time can be had for \$30-40k and a few Cherokee airframes are being offered at prices I've only ever seen 150s sold for (though there's likely something wrong with those examples).</p>

<p>The aircraft, while different externally (the 172's overhead-wing versus the Cherokee's low-wing design is the biggest difference), seem to have many similar specs on paper; passenger count, horsepower variants (Piper's actually better here as the 180hp variant was most common compared to the standard 172 powerplant at 160hp), instrument capabilities, etc. Cockpit pictures indicate the interiors are comparable; a bit dated as you'd expect from aircraft made 30 years ago, but perfectly serviceable.</p>

<p>So the question is, where's the additional retained ""street value"" of the 172 coming from? Is the 172 more well-reputed for safety or reliability? Are its handling characteristics considered better for everyday flight (perhaps due to the parasol wing)? Is this a question of average age of airframes? Is it just the Cessna name (in other words, am I comparing a Toyota Camry to a BMW 5-series)? </p>

<p>Obviously some of this stuff will depend on a comparison of specific hulls, but there's a definite trend; the market in general seems to value the 172 more highly than the PA-28 with all other things being equal on paper. The question is why.</p>
","<p>There are a lot of factors here but in reality a 172 and a Cherokee are about the same price, lets look the reality. </p>

<p>First off a huge chunk of people rent instead of buy.

<p>Yes they are similar planes but the truth is that the price things actually trade hands for is often not disclosed and is almost always not the list price in terms of used stuff. There is a bit of preference as well, if you trained in a piper you may be more inclined to stay in a piper and likewise with the Cessnas.</p>

<p>As for safety the 172 is a very <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/1995/December/1/Cessna-172-Safety-Review"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">safe plane</a> by anyones standards. Then again <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/1994/October/1/PA-28-Safety-Review"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">so is the Cherokee</a> and it seems that the argument can go on forever but the numbers are the numbers (accidents per 100,000 hours of flight) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 172: 6.17 overall accident rate.</p>
  
  <p>The Cherokee: Cherokees came in at 6.86</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality a small difference but lets be honest they are about on par. For what its its worth the Cherokee numbers include the Arrow which is a retractable and suffers from the proverbial gear up landing as well as other things that make a retractable potentially fail more than a fixed gear plane. This may account for the difference in safety record (again, a very slight difference).</p>

<p>While similar on paper there are some mission profiles that allow the planes to serve different roles and may make the 172 more attractive in some cases. The high wing design allows for excellent downward view which makes the 172 a great plane for areal surveying/photography/pipe line check ups and similar tasks. The 172 also sports 2 doors compared to the single one on the Cherokee. That being said some feel as though the 172 is a bit easier to get into for the less nimble, but I am young and nimble so I cant speak to this. There are also those who like the high wing design for landing on grass or other back country flying due to the increased ground clearance of the wing allowing you to avoid obstacles.   </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQqBS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>From an aircraft family standpoint the Cherokee 235 had a much better useful load than the highest power 172's. However even the 180 Cherokee has a better useful load than the 180 Cessna. When you are flying around a family this is worth considering. </p>

<p>Although Cessna had it to an extent, Piper has always had the selling point of ""stepping up through the planes"". The idea being that your mission (as time went on) would be to go faster, further and higher, subsequently you would need a bigger plane. They facilitated this by delivering a very constant platform in the, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cherokee</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arrow</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-32"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cherokee 6/Lance/Saratoga</a> then up through twins with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-44_Seminole"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seminole</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-34_Seneca"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seneca</a> if you need to go there.

<blockquote>
  <p>TWA flew to Europe nonstop from O'Hare starting in 1958</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.gcmap.com/dist?P=ord-lhr%0D%0A&amp;DU=mi&amp;DM=&amp;SG=&amp;SU=mph"">Great Circle Route</a> distance from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport"">ORD/KORD</a> to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport"">LHR/EGLL</a> is 3953 miles. Other major European airports would have been farther away.</p>

<p>What aircraft were capable of making that <strong>non-stop</strong> flight in 1958 (also, how long would it have taken)? </p>
","<p>The first scheduled trans-atlantic air service was made possible with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_flight#Early_notable_transatlantic_flights_and_attempts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zeppelins</a>. The LZ-127 started flying the route in 1931, mostly to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakehurst_Maxfield_Field"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lakehurst, NJ</a>, or Pernambuco in Brazil, but was disassembled in 1940.</p>

<p>The first airliner which was able to cover the distance (back then it was Berlin - New York) was the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_200_Condor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Focke-Wulf 200</a>, which in 1938 needed almost 25 hours East-West and 20 hours on the return leg. With its slow cruise speed, wind made a lot of difference. Sadly, the US did not allow Lufthansa to start the scheduled service it had planned to open in 1939. Lufthansa had opened regular air mail services in 1934 between Europe and South America using flying boats and a relay ship in the middle of the Atlantic. Air France added its transatlantic mail service flying from Africa to South America and back.</p>

<p>The first heavier-than-air transatlantic passenger service opened between New York and Marseille in 1939 on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_314_Clipper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing 314 Clippers</a> operated by Pan Am. It crossed the Atlantic between Foynes, Ireland and Botwood, Newfoundland. A British service, also using flying boats, was in preparation but stopped by the beginning of WW II.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, there were already several options for transatlantic air travel, but none of them non-stop from Chicago: Pan Am, TWA, Trans Canada Airlines (TCA), BOAC (successor of Imperial Airways), and Air France all operated large propeller aircraft which covered the distance with refueling steps, typically in Gander (Newfoundland) and Shannon (Ireland). Typical aircraft were the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Douglas DC-4</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DC-6</a>, and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lockheed 149 Constellation</a>, but also the French <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lat%C3%A9co%C3%A8re_631"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Latecoere 631</a> flying boat was used until 1955. Of these airlines, only <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pan Am and BOAC serviced O'Hare</a> in 1957, before the first international terminal opened there in the following year.</p>

<p>Still, the prevailing eastward wind made the East-West crossing hard and required airlines to reduce payload, and only the advent of faster  airliners like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Douglas DC-7</a> (from 1956) and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-1649_Starliner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lockheed 1649 Starliner</a> (from 1957) made the transatlantic services more reliable and economical. Beginning with the DC-7C, their range was sufficient to support transatlantic service directly from Chicago O'Hare.</p>

<p>In October 1958 the first transatlantic jet airliner service was opened by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BOAC</a> using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">de Havilland Comet 4</a>, followed shortly after by Pan Am, operating the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing 707</a> and connecting London with New York (with an occasional refueling stop at Gander on westbound flights). O'Hare could only participate in this progress after its main runway was extended to <a href=""http://airwaysnews.com/blog/2014/04/07/chicago-ohare-history/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">accommodate large jets in June 1960</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the most likely airplanes to fly transatlantic directly from O'Hare would have been the DC-7C (but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Douglas_DC-7_operators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">operated by Pan Am</a>, not TWA), the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-1049_Super_Constellation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lockheed L-1049G</a> and the L-1649, which both were operated by TWA. For the flying time, the <a href=""http://www.airmilescalculator.com/distance/jfk-to-ory/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3628 miles from JFK/Idlewild to Paris Orly</a> took 14¼ hours with the DC-7C and 14.83 hours with the Lockheed 1649. So it is fair to assume a flying time of 15½ to 16 hours for the slightly longer distance between Heathrow and O'Hare.</p>

<p>Quote from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-1649_Starliner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

"What is the ""area rule""?","6178","","<p>The ""area rule"" states that the supersonic drag on an aircraft is related to the total area on part of the aircraft. What is the exact definition of the rule? Why does this happen?</p>
","<p>You might have heard of the elliptical lift distribution which minimizes induced drag for a given span and a given lift. Area ruling is similar, but here it is about the lengthwise distribution of cross-sectional areas of a plane, and it minimizes wave drag at Mach 1.</p>

<p>The first picture is from a Junkers patent of 1944: Junkers found out in 1943 that transsonic drag can be minimized by shifting the parts of an airplane around. In this case it was the EF-122, a research project which became the Ju-287. The easiest bodies to shift were the engine nacelles, that is why the end product has such odd engine locations. The drawing shows several shaded cross sections along lines which carry Roman numerals: Plot the sum of all areas along each line over the aircraft's length coordinate, and you get a distribution which must be optimized such that it has the maximum area for the smallest gradients.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K1a8X.png"" alt=""Illustration from 1943 Junkers patent""></p>

<p>The next picture shows how those plots look like. This is from a different source, so it shows generic wing-body combinations. On the left is an airplane with a fuselage shaped like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears%E2%80%93Haack_body"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sears-Haak body</a>. A Sears-Haak body is an optimum shape for the biggest volume with a given wave drag and was discovered by Wolfgang Haak in 1941 and again by William Sears in 1947. The wings come on top and mess up the area distribution by creating a bump in the middle.</p>

<p>The right plot shows what can be achieved by taking all parts of the airplane into account. The difference is shown in the small center plot.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/drn62.png"" alt=""Comparison of areas and drag over Mach of regular and area-ruled aircraft""></p>

<p>How this is done: Take away from the fuselage what is added by the wings. The result is a fuselage wich looks like a coke bottle. You can also add Küchenmann bodies; older airliners have plenty of them. Look especially at fuselages like those of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Buccaneer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blackburn Buccaneer</a>, or  T-tails like those of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il-62"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Illjushin Il-62</a> or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu-154"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tupolev Tu-154</a>. Today, things like engine pylons or flap track fairings are used as Küchemann bodies to smoothen out the lengthwise area distribution, and if you look carefully you will see the coke bottle technique on the fuselage around the horizontal tail of many airliners. They don't fly at Mach 1, but close enough that area ruling makes a difference already.</p>

Why would the pilot spiral, not just essentially go straight up?</p>

<p><sup>* An excellent series if you're a big kid who enjoys toys, and as a bunch o' GA pilots, I'd think that covers most of you!</sup></p>
","<p>A helicopter will achieve its best climb rate at a moderate forward speed. Climbing in a spiral helps to have forward speed in what is essentially a vertical climb.</p>

<p>In a hover all the airflow which is available for lift creation must be generated by the rotation of the main rotor. This means that a small amount of air must be accelerated by a lot. If the helicopter adds forward speed, it can achieve a higher mass flow through the rotor, and now less acceleration is needed to achieve the same lift. This improves the efficiency of lift creation. If the helicopter goes faster than its speed for maximum rate of climb, aerodynamic drag grows too high and reduces efficiency again.</p>

<p>The difference can be dramatic: Below is a plot of the speed versus altitude of a generic helicopter and turboprop plane in comparison to the V-22 tilt rotor. Remember that the available power is roughly proportional to air density, and you can start to see how much more power is available for climbing when the helicopter flies with a moderate forward speed.</p>

<p>For example, ice the size of a brick.</p>
","<p>It depends on the severity of the hailstorm. In the event of encountering large hail pieces in the sky during cruise, a pilot will generally try to climb above the storm (of course with ATC permission) to prevent damage to the airframe. However, it is always better to stay out of the hailstorm in the first place and pilots will usually try to negotiate a course avoiding the hailstorm entirely using available weather data.</p>

<p>However, there are much more extreme cases such as this Boeing 727 which cracked its radome <em>and</em> its windshield after flying through a hailstorm at FL 350:</p>

"How does a jet's throttle actually work?","6166","","<p>How does a jet's throttle actually work? What does it do to the pressure chamber and the fire output controller?</p>
","<p>I'd suggest that you review the topic of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">how a jet engine works</a>, first, and then review how a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_control_unit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jet engine fuel control unit</a> works as it doesn't sound like you're very familiar with engine components; I've never heard of a 'pressure chamber' or 'fire output controller'.</p>

<p>Modern jet aircraft technically don't use throttles; rather they are equipped with thrust levers which are connected to a Fuel Control Unit (FCU).  This can come in the form of a mechanical computer in the case of earlier engines or a digital electronic computer called a Fully Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC), similar to the schematic in <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/32654"">aeroalias's answer</a> for the F100 fighter engine installation on the F-16 airplane.</p>

<p>Early jet aircraft did use a throttle - literally a cockpit lever connected to a throttleable valve to precisely meter fuel into the combustion chamber(s) of the engine.  This could be problematic to operate in flight as the fuel rate has to be changed as altitude - and consequently combustor inlet conditions - changes, making the engine vulnerable to flameouts from excessively rich fuel flow and compressor stalls from abrupt throttle changes.  FCUs were developed, specific to each engine to offer simplified control.</p>

"Which hand do fighter pilots use for the control stick?","6148","","<p>Here is a question that has been bothering me for a while. Do right-handed fighter pilots use their right hand to hold the control stick? <strong>And do left-handed fighter pilots use their left hand?</strong></p>

<p>Or is it the other way around? Or do they maybe use both hands a lot of the time? It also brings up the question as to what the other hand is expected to do and which side of the cockpit the most common control buttons are on.</p>

<p>My guess is that since most people are right handed, they use their right hand. There's also triggers on the yoke so it seems all the more likely that the right hand is used for right-handers. </p>

<p>I'm asking because you look at <strong>video games and their controllers</strong>. They always use the <strong>left joystick</strong> for moving the character. In the case of flight simulators, the <strong>left joystick</strong> is used as the 'stick' or yoke. So you're pretty much left with no choice but to use your left thumb. Not saying this is awkward for video games, however, on those big joysticks for PC games, I remember I always used my right hand.</p>

<p>Also, let's ignore civil commercial piloting because those seem to usually use steering wheel type controls, not a traditional stick. Please let me know if you're a fighter pilot when you answer, because the triggers on the yoke have an effect on which hand you're most comfortable with.</p>
","<p>Most fighter pilots, regardless of their handedness, use their right hand to fly the stick, and their left hand to move the throttle(s)/PCL (Power Control Lever). This is just how most fighter cockpits are set up, with the power on the left side.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ylyWkl.jpg"" alt=""Eurofighter Typhoon cockpit""></p>

<p>The sticks are also not really usable for a left hander because a few of the buttons would be inaccessible with a left hand on the stick. In some cases (like the F-16), the cockpit uses a <em>sidestick</em> layout, with the stick on the edge of the cockpit, rather than in between the pilot's legs.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJwofl.jpg"" alt=""F-16 cockpit (note the sidestick on the right and the throttle on the left)""></p>

<p>So no, <strong>it would not really be possible for left-handed pilots to fly with their left hand on the stick for long periods of time</strong> (I will note, that if you need to select something on the right side, most will hold the stick lightly in their left hand for a brief second, actuate the item with their right hand, and then switch back) unless the entire cockpit were redesigned, which is just not worth it.</p>

"Why doesn't the Concorde have any wing fences?","6141","","<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_fence"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wing Fence</a> is a straight, vertical ""fence"" running from forwards to backwards down the wing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iV2KP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-17"" rel=""noreferrer"">MiG-17</a> has three fences per wing. I've also seen them on delta-winged aircraft such as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-25"" rel=""noreferrer"">MiG-25</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the wing fence is to prevent the air from flowing sideways over the wing. Air instead becomes trapped between the fences and flows front to back as normal. This is the ideal condition for creating lift, because the air follows the camber of the wing.</p>

<p>So why doesn't the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde"" rel=""noreferrer"">Concorde</a> have them?</p>

<p>This is the reason for having wing fence in aircraft such as Mig-25- to avert stall and improve stability.

<pre><code>EQUIVALENT SAFETY FINDING         E-2107: Passenger Extension to 180
APPLICABILITY:                    A320
REQUIREMENTS:                     JAR 25.807
ADVISORY MATERIAL:                N/A
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Statement of Issue:  </p>
  
  <p>An application was made on September 30, 1992 to JAA for certification of maximum number of passengers of 180.</p>
  
  <p>Paragraph 25.807(c)(1) of JAR specifies for passenger seating configuration, the number and
  types of Emergency Exits for each side of the fuselage.
  The maximum seating capacity allowable under JAR 25.807(c)(1) for A320 exit configuration is
  179 (2 Type I and 2 Type III).</p>
  
  <p>However, the exits size for front and rear doors on the A320 is such (32x73 inches) that they
  are oversized Type I and therefore can be considered as a non standard exit arrangement.</p>
  
  <p>The same exit size is being used on a derivative of the A320, for which Latin Square Tests
  have been conducted in order to establish an appropriate rating for that kind of exits. These
  tests have shown that, when associated with the performance of the slide installed at these
  exits, a rating of 55 passengers is appropriate.</p>
  
  <p>It should also be noted that the full scale emergency evacuation demonstration of the A320
  with 179 passengers has demonstrated compliance with JAR 25.803(c) with sufficient margin
  to justify 180 passengers.</p>
  
  <p>Under those conditions, a maximum capacity of 180 passengers is requested for the A320.</p>
  
  <p>JAA Conclusion:
  Based upon the demonstrated higher rating for the floor level exits and the adequate margins
  for 179 passengers shown in the 90 seconds demonstration, and used as a basis to show
  compliance to JAR 25.803(c), the JAA accept 180 passengers as the maximum capacity for the
  A320 on the basis of an Equivalent Safety Finding.</p>

  this <em>fatigue</em>, two of the four anti-rotation lugs on the NLG upper
  support assembly fractured and separated. This allowed NLG to deviate
  from the 0° position. Another contributing factor was BSCU system
  logic, which prevented NLG from centering. Also contributing was the
  lack of a procedure to attempt to reset the BSCU system under these

  <p>What part aft of the bulkhead would leak pressure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a partial misunderstanding of what a bulkhead is there for.</p>

<p>You could build the aft cone section to keep the pressure, but it would be a much heavier solution.</p>

<p>The shape of the final aft section is not well suited to resist pressurization stresses: the best shape is a sphere; the cylinder (with spherical terminations) comes a close second. The conical shape would require serious stiffeners to survive pressurization cycles for the whole life of the aircraft; the bulkhead solves this problem by using a shape that is naturally more resistant to stresses - and thus can be built with less material - leading to less weight, and hence fuel savings (in addition to the increased safety).</p>

"Do airlines continue operating in the vicinity of a hurricane?","6105","","<p>Have hung around some of the aviation interest groups (like airliners.net) and tried to research this but haven't found very clear answers.</p>

<p>Typically when a hurricane (tropical, peak wind-speed in excess of 100 mph) makes landfall, it sheds most of it's energy and water near the coast-line, however the rainfall and wind-speed heat-map (that is elevated beyond the seasonal average) may be over a very large area. Also a hurricane might move at a speed such that the weather conditions might change the large area (covered by the heat-map) over 2-3 days.</p>

<p>So, my questions in view of the above understanding are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Whether normal flight operations continue (barring the to/from the airports that are directly under the hurricane path), in this vast other region that is part of the heatmap? (Say with airports in areas showing rainfall up to 3 inches, and windspeeds upto 50-60 mph.)</li>
<li>If commercial airlines do operate in such weather, what should I expect the ride to be like?</li>
<li>What are the chances of such flights being diverted?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the <a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/6TEkg3YQp"" rel=""nofollow"">WebCite archived webpage</a> (so this link won't go away) of Weather.com that I am referring to.</p>

<p>PS. I plan to take a flight from Bangalore to Delhi to Kathmandu, on Monday, as the tropical cyclone (as it is called here in Indian subcontinent) is about to make landfall on the eastern coast of India around noon, and we are expecting upto 3 inches of rainfall and winds upto 60mph here on Monday morning.</p>

<p>I wanted to see if I should seriously consider rescheduling flights. A call to my airline customer-care yielded no useful information, and they seemed rather clueless. I read in the local newspaper that train services are being shutdown in the affected area, although it seems to be more like trains that pass through the area with the maximum impact.</p>
","<p>The cross-wind limit is 35-40 <em>knots</em> for most aircraft with gusts allowed to perhaps 45 or so. The head-wind limit is slightly higher, but not much.</p>

<p>Knot is nautical mile per hour. Nautical mile is 1.852 km, that is 1.15 mile. So wind more than 40 miles/hour may interrupt airport operations and wind more than 50 miles/hour surely will. I don't think there is a specific limit for rain; it is generally not a big problem if the runways are in good condition.</p>

<p>Problem is that good local forecasts are possible for at most around 24 hours. So it's not possible to tell whether it is likely there will be disruption of operations the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>For one day ahead, the airport forecasts are publicly available on the internet. Search for TAF (""terminal aerodrome forecast"") with the ICAO (the 4-letter one) code of the airport. They are published in strange abbreviations, but there are sites that will happily decode it for you.</p>

"How does an aircraft form wake turbulence?","6096","","<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8860/how-are-these-airbus-a350s-flying-in-formation-without-being-affected-by-wake-tu"">This question</a> discusses how wake turbulence can affect planes flying in formation.  It got me wondering, how do aircraft (the wings in particular) form wake turbulence to begin with?  It can't be as simple as tip vortexes right?</p>

<p>As a follow up, how can you design an aircraft to minimize wake turbulence?  And what are the trade offs in doing so? </p>
","<p><strong>Origin of the vortices</strong></p>

<p>Wake turbulence is easy to understand once you know how a wing creates lift: By deflecting the air flowing across it downwards. In <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8556/is-a-winglet-better-than-an-equal-span-extension/8579#8579"">this answer</a>, I had used the simplification of just accelerating downwards all the air flowing through a circle with a diameter equal to the wingspan, and leaving all other air unaffected.</p>

<p>This helps to understand the principle of lift creation, but is too simple, of course, because the downward movement of air will create a void above it, and the air below has to make place for that downward moving streamtube. Also, the pressure field around the wing will affect the air in the vicinity of the streamtube as well, and in consequence air from below will be pushed sideways already by the wing, and the air above will start to flow towards the low pressure area over the wing. This sideways movement will become more pronounced aft of the wing, such that air will continuously be pressed outwards below the wing's wake, move up left and right of it and inwards above the wake. The inertia of the downwash keeps it moving downwards for several minutes, continuously displacing the air below it and sucking more air into the space above, and that will result in two vortices swirling behind the wing. This is the rolling up of the wake (see the sketch below, taken from <a href=""http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1971/jul-aug/carten.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this source</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvizJ.jpg"" alt=""roll-up of wake""></p>

<p>The vortices are just a consequence of the downward movement of the wake, and this in turn is a consequence of lift creation. Please note that the cores of the vortices are closer together than the wingspan! This by itself should make clear that they are not caused by air flowing around wingtips, a hard to extinguish misconception. The table below gives calculations of this vortex spacing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WruGU.jpg"" alt=""table of vortex characteristics""></p>

<p>The table is also from the <a href=""http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1971/jul-aug/carten.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carten paper of 1971</a>; note the inclusion of Boeing's 2707 project!</p>

<p><strong>Strength of the vortices</strong></p>

<p>If we again come back to the simplified streamtube approximation, lift is proportional to the mass of air flowing through it per unit of time times the deflection angle. If lift is equal to the aircraft's mass (as it should be), heavy aircraft need to either accelerate more air (wider span) or accelerate air more (higher deflection angle) than light aircraft at the same speed. A higher deflection angle will produce more powerful vortices. For that reason, a heavy aircraft at low speed and with a small wingspan will produce the strongest vortices.</p>

<p>Since more air flows through the streamtube at higher flight speed, flying faster will require less deflection, making the wake vortices weaker. If the aircraft climbs, air becomes less dense with altitude, and less mass flow over the wing is available, so the vortices grow stronger if the flight speed does not change. Normally, aircraft accelerate when climbing, and the vortex strength will stay the same if the aircraft flies at constant dynamic pressure.</p>

<p>Vortices can be avoided in three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Infinite wing span (meaning infinite mass flow, so no deflection is necessary for any lift)</li>
<li>Infinite speed (again, gives infinite mass flow)</li>
<li>No weight of the aircraft. Flying a zero-g parabola does indeed produce almost no wake turbulence.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>End of the vortices</strong></p>

<p>Inertia will keep the wake moving downwards and the vortices spinning, but friction will let those air movements die down within a few minutes. If the aircraft flies high, the wake is dissipated long before it hits the ground. The wake of low flying aircraft, however, does hit the ground and is deflected. The vortex tube now acts like a wheel and starts moving outward, and if there is a sufficient crosswind, the windward vortex can be arrested as in the right sketch below (also from the Carten report).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dvoF7.jpg"" alt=""Interference with ground""> </p>

<p><strong>Photographic evidence</strong></p>

<p>There are far too <a href=""http://kitskinny.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/jets-clouds-effects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many pretty pictures around of wake vortices</a> to not include some, so I will add a few here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6Fn5.jpg"" alt=""B-747 with contrails""></p>

<p>You can see that the outer contrails of this Boeing 747's engines wrap around the contrails of the inner engines. This shows how the air is pushed down in the wake of the wing and that the centers of the vortices are slightly inboard of the outer engines.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cyr0c.jpg"" alt=""A-340""></p>

<p>The condensation traces originating at the winglet tips of this A340 move in- and upward, again showing that the vortex does not originate from the tips but forms behind the wing and with a distance between the two vortex cores of substantially less than the wingspan.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oS0oX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>These two pictures show how the downwash of the wake is cutting a furrow in the clouds.</p>

<p>MD-11 on a moist day, flaps set for landing. One, it shows how insignificant the tip vortex is compared to vorticity shed at the flap tips, and Two it shows how the tip vortex moves inward and starts to be sucked into the wake vortex. Note also the tip vortices from the tail!</p>

","<p>They're called <strong>aerobatic sights.</strong></p>

<p>Most attitude indicators (AI) that tell the plane's attitude with reference to the horizon don't have the full range of motion that aerobatic planes go through.</p>

<p>If left alone, the AI would tumble out of control and become useless. That's why aerobatic pilots <strong>cage</strong> the AI—lock it in position before flying extreme maneuvers.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator"">Wikipedia</a>—</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the aircraft rolls too steeply or achieves an extreme pitch attitude — while performing aerobatics, for example — the attitude indicator can ""tumble"" (or ""topple"") and become temporarily unusable. For this reason, some attitude indicators are fitted with a ""caging mechanism"" (a device to restore the gyroscope to an erect position). Some attitude indicators can be manually erected once the airplane is in level flight using the caging mechanism.</p>
  
  <p>Most modern instruments are designed to tolerate 360 degrees of rotation in pitch and roll without tumbling, although periods of violent aerobatics may tumble any gyro horizon. Once tumbled, an instrument without a caging mechanism may not be able to re-erect itself until power is removed and the aircraft is in a level pitch and roll attitude for a long enough period that the gyro rotor comes to a stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mounted sights would then give the aerobatic pilot a pitch angle reference, by judging the sight's position to the horizon—especially that they're lined up abeam to the pilot (unlike the wing tips) as shown in @Airsick's <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/35164/14897"">answer</a>.</p>

"Why do we never see high-bypass turbofan engines sharing the same nacelle on large airliners and similar aircraft?","6029","","<p>I'm talking about this sort of thing (this is the fictional airplane from <em>Casino Royale</em>), rather than two (or more) engines per wing in individual nacelles:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0e7Gs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If we ignore the weird 'drop tanks' on the outer pylons, what makes this design inferior to one with individual nacelles? I can think of some highly speculative pros and cons for both layouts:</p>

<p><strong>Pros for shared nacelles:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Shared nacelle and pylon potentially means less frontal and wetted area per engine, which could maybe reduce overall drag.</li>
<li>Overall, this scheme seems to allow the 'center of thrust' for all the engines on one wing to come closer to the centerline of the aircraft. In some designs like the A380, where a <em>massive</em> vertical fin is needed to maintain yaw authority in an engine(s)-out situation, it seems like this could save quite a bit of weight and drag by reducing the size of the vertical fin.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons for shared nacelles:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Obviously there is an increased risk that an uncontained engine failure like the one on an A380 a few years ago could cause cascading failures in its 'neighbor'. I'm not sure how to quantify this risk, but it seems significant.</li>
<li>Additionally, a structural failure in a pylon/nacelle (extremely rare but it does happen IIRC) will affect two engines instead of one.</li>
<li>Maintenance will be probably be more difficult, since you'll have to mess with two engines just to get at one.</li>
<li>I'd expect that due to the structural requirements of supporting two engines on one pylon, you probably wouldn't save much weight and you might actually end up with a heavier aircraft, all other things being equal.</li>
<li>Maybe you'd lose some efficiency in the interaction between the exhausts of both engines in a nacelle?</li>
<li>It might turn out that you can't fit two large high-bypass turbofans into one nacelle without choosing between flow separation issues and greatly increased frontal area.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all layman speculation, though. In reality, from an engineer's point of view, is the choice of one layout over the other obvious? Why or why not?</p>
","<h2>Short answer</h2>

<p>It's the vastly different flow conditions from static to cruise which demand a separate placing of high-bypass-ratio jet engines. They would produce less thrust and more drag when paired.</p>

<h2>Why were there paired engines at all?</h2>

<p>The early jets had their engines mounted directly beneath or in the wing, and comparisons between separately mounted and twinned engines showed a slight advantage for the latter due to lower wetted surface area and less impact on the wing.</p>

<p>Arado built two four-engined prototypes of their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_234"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ar-234</a> jet, one with separate engines (V6, see directly below) and one with paired engines (V8, further down). The V8 became the prototype of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_234#Ar_234C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C version</a> of the Ar-234.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7l3im.jpg"" alt=""Arado 234 V6""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y9yop.jpg"" alt=""Arado 234 V8""></p>

<p>However, with the increasing airflow of high-bypass-ratio engines the interference between both will turn pairing into a disadvantage. In cruise, <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9432/pratt-whitney-jt3d-inlet-doors-purpose/9433#9433"">only the central stream tube flowing towards the engine will be ingested</a>, and the rest will spill over the intake lip. Placing a second engine directly next to the first will block the flow of spilled air on that side and will increase spill flow on the opposite side. This will most likely cause massive separation there if the intake is not heavily modified, leading to noticeable drag increase. Also, the now asymmetric flow in the intake would reduce the efficiency of the fan - it needs very homogenous flow over the full cross section in today's engines.</p>

<p>Conversely, at low speed the engine <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11723/why-do-engine-cowl-lips-appear-larger-and-more-blunt-on-the-sides-than-on-the-to/11730#11730"">sucks in air from all around</a> and will face competition from a second engine, such that both will not be able to ingest as much air as when mounted separately.

"Why are airplanes parked at the gate with max rudder deflection?","6020","","<p>Quite often I see aircraft parked at the gate with rudder deflected to the max. I see this either with Boeing and Airbus aircraft so it must have been done on purpose. I know that there are dampers connected to the yaw, or are those not powerful enough to keep the rudder straight e.g. undeflected?</p>
","<p>The control surfaces of airliners are not connected to the pilots' control via cables; they are operated by a hydraulic pump. When the engines are shut down, there is no hydraulic pressure in the pipes, and the control surface is free to move.</p>

<p><strong>The rudder is moved from the center position by wind</strong>. If you observe the gates, you should note that all airplanes have their rudder deflected to the same direction. In a perfect no-wind scenario, the rudder would stay neutral.</p>

<p>There are no gust locks which the pilot must arm before leaving the cockpit on Boeing aircraft (and I presume Airbus too). Gust locks are, however, common in general aviation aircraft. They can also be found on some small business jets. </p>

<p>The reason being, control surfaces on small aircraft work ""both ways"" - if you move the elevator by hand, the yoke in the cockpit will move as well. These are called ""<em>reversible flight control systems</em>"". Therefore, when the control surfaces are moved by wind, the entire system - yoke, cables, wheels, bearings etc. are all moved back and forth. This brings a significant amount of wear and stress to the system. Strong wind may also cause the surfaces to deflect past their designed maximum, causing damage.</p>

<p>The control surfaces on airliners are much heavier and much stronger. Also, they are not ""directly"" connected to the cockpit's controls - when there is no hydraulic power, pretty much every component is disconnected. Unless you're facing gale force winds, it is safe to just let them swing free with wind and gravity.</p>

Hot starts are hit or miss. If it sits over an hour it may start but if I miss it it has to sit for at least another hour till I try again or forget it. I've tried 1/2"" throttle, full lean with and without fuel pump; full throttle, full lean with and without fuel pump and all combinations I can think of. Most of the time it spins without any cough or catch. Due for 50 hour oil change and will ask that plugs and magnetos are checked. I'm afraid to go anywhere for fear of being stranded for hours. </p>
","<p>The issue is undoubtedly vapor lock. In the fuel injected Lyc 540, the fuel injection plumbing is on the top of the engine which is the cold side of the engine when you are flying but when parked, heat rises! The following procedure runs cooler fuel through the plumbing while flooding the engine, then the flooded start procedure is necessary.</p>

"Why do piston engines in aircraft burn fuel at a higher rate than a comparable car engine?","6015","","<p>I've never understood why piston powered plane engines burn such a large  amount of fuel per time period than car engines. </p>

<p>Can anyone elaborate on this?</p>

<p>I know that a C172M will burn ~5-9+ gph at 2200-2550 RPM between 2k-12k feet based on the POH.  This gives a decent idea of the fuel burn in a very narrow RPM range at various altitudes.  According to the POH, she came with a Lycoming 0-320-E2D. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycoming_O-320"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> states that the 0-320 provides 150-160HP using a 5.23l engine.</p>

<p>My car on the other hand has a 2l 4 cylinder <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_9-3#Second-generation_9-3_engines"" rel=""noreferrer"">engine</a>. At 70mph in top gear @ ~2300rpm she gets about 30mpg for a calculated 2.33gph. To me highway speeds at constant RPM provides comparable engine conditions to that of cruise phase of flight.</p>

<p>5.23l / 2l = 2.61 </p>

<p>2.61* 2.33mpg = ~6gph </p>

<p>Does that basic analysis hold? Is the larger displacement the main factor in fuel consumption difference between the two? I consider this figure of ~6gph close enough to the 5-10gph listed in the POH for such a back of the napkin calculation if the analysis is more or less correct.</p>

<p>This leads to a follow up question: Is there a reason for the large displacement and low HP? For comparison a 5.7l truck <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Big-Block_engine#348"" rel=""noreferrer"">engine</a> from the 70s output 250HP for a gain of 100HP for .47l additional displacement when compared to the Lycoming. I'm in no way very knowledgeable about engine's but am guessing the answer lies in engineering trade offs for making the engine lighter or out of a different material for aviation use or for higher compression ratios for the fuel. Any detailed input would be appreciated. </p>

<p>I know that Volkswagen and Subaru engines have been used for aircraft.  Although my research has been very light, it still looks like the fuel <a href=""http://www.ez.org/pages/alwick/index_files/Page404.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">consumption</a> is in the same range.</p>

<p>Going back to my car vs the C172M, or the EcoTec vs Lycoming, 173hp@ 5500rpm for the EcoTec and assuming a (most probably false) linear fuel consumption based on RPM,  </p>

<p>5500rpm /2300rpm = 2.39</p>

<p>2.39 * 2.33gph (@2300rpm) = 5.56gph</p>

<p>for comparable HP.</p>

<p>If my analysis provided here is close to the true answer, then I think I've cleared up my misunderstanding by writing out this question.  However, I would like someone more knoowledgeable about such things (possibly an A&amp;P who is also a gearhead) to pipe in and verify or enlighten my analysis.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>As others have noted, airplane engines and car engines have very different duty cycles.  An airplane engine will typically run at full power for a few minutes during takeoff &amp; climb, then at a large fraction of max during level flight, which may last for hours, and be throttled back only during descent and landing.</p>

<p>An auto engine, by contrast, only operates at full power for a few seconds, as you for instance accelerate up that freeway on-ramp, then it will be throttled back to produce the small fraction of full power that's needed to maintain freeway cruise speeds¹.  Since the power output is proportional to fuel consumed², your car engine uses much less fuel.  Even though it might be rated to produce the same max HP as the airplane engine, in normal operation it produces much lower HP for the vast majority of its operating time.  You can see this in operation if you drive a car with a real-time fuel consumption gauge.  For instance, my Insight hybrid shows ~25 mpg when accelerating or climbing mountains (using near full power), but 75 mpg or better cruising on a level interstate.</p>

<p>Also note that the actual fuel economy of an airplane isn't that much different from say your average SUV.  I don't have the exact figures any more, but I once calculated that my Cherokee 180 got about 18 mpg.  When you figure that it's going twice as fast, and on longer trips can shorten the actual distance travelled by going in a straight line instead of having to follow roads, the comparison isn't that bad.</p>

<p>¹This, incidentially, is why hybrid cars can use electric assist to get much better mpg - the gas engine can be just big enough for efficient cruise, while acceleration is provided by the electric motor.</p>

<p>²To a first approximation.  It's a lot more complicated in the real world.  Look up BSFC maps if you're curious.</p>

"Why is the quality of radio communication bad?","6013","","<p>Why don't modern planes and ATC centers have good-quality audio for communication? For example in this video: <div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

Or basically any other example of pilot communication(some are worse, some are better).  </p>

<p>This is not terribly bad of course, but this is comparable to a cheap $4 headset, the sound is so distorted. This can cause trouble when a pilot does not understand some words and asks to repeat the sentence. And even more problems if the pilot or flight dispatcher are not native English speakers.  </p>

<p>Is there some technical reason behind this, like antenna/signal limitations within the plane? The quality is the same when the pilot is just taxiing on the ground, so I suppose this has nothing to do with speed or altitude.  </p>

<p>P.S. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/15222/why-is-the-sound-quality-of-onboard-public-address-so-bad"">This question</a> is somewhat similar, but it is about the PA system for passengers, I am talking about pilot-ATC communication. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
Though I accepted(honestly - by peer pressure) answer from TomMcW, who gave quite good technical details on this subject, I personally like the answer by Anthony X, who pointed out very important fact that the systems should be changed everywhere worldwide in a very short time period and that is what probably the reason no major changes were made during last couple of decades. So I suggest to read his answer too, not only top-voted one.</p>
","<p>There is a technical reason for this. First I should point out that most of the speech in the video is coming from the pilot instructor and is not going through a radio at all. It it simply the sound right out of his headset. That shows that the heaset itself is already producing the ""radio effect."" Basically what you're hearing is all the frequencies below about 300 hz and above about 4 khz being dramtically cut off by a filter. That leaves a very narrow band of audio frequencies.</p>

<p>Although this sound is very artificial, the first reason is that it filters out as much background noise as it can leaving only the voice. Most of what makes speech intelligible occurs in this range. </p>

<p>The second reason is because atc communication uses AM radio. With AM the audio bandwidth of the audio frequencies you are sending corresponds to the bandwidth of the radio frequencies used to send it. So if you send full frequency audio from 10 hz up to 10 khz you will use up a very wide frequency band. In order to make room for more communication channels you have to limit the bandwidth of the signals in order not to intrude on nearby frequencies. </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airband"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikipedia:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The audio quality in the airband is limited by the RF bandwidth used. In the newer channel spacing scheme, the largest bandwidth of an airband channel might be limited to 8.33 kHz, so the highest possible audio frequency is 4.165 kHz.[14] In the 25 kHz channel spacing scheme, an upper audio frequency of 12.5 kHz would be theoretically possible.[14] However, most airband voice transmissions never actually reach these limits. Usually, the whole transmission is contained within a 6 kHz to 8 kHz bandwidth, corresponding to an upper audio frequency of 3 kHz to 4 kHz.[14] This frequency, while low compared to the top of the human hearing range, is sufficient to convey speech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be a bandwidth limit enforced by the authorities to maximize availability of frquencies. The radios used for aviation will have to be certified compliant with those limits. In the US that would be the FCC (Friendly Candy Company). But I don't have the specific stautory limits. Maybe some one come up with them.</p>

"Why were the speed records set by seaplanes in the early thirties?","5994","","<p>For nearly all of the 1930'ies, the fastest aeroplanes were all of the seaplane category (as opposed to landplanes, to use the terminology of <a href=""http://www.fai.org/record-powered-aeroplanes"" rel=""noreferrer"">FAI</a>).</p>

<p>Presumably, the designers of the two categories had access to more or less the same technology (engines, materials, aerodynamics, etc.) given the large interest in the subject and funding available.</p>

<p>If we for a second rely on Wikipedia for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record"" rel=""noreferrer"">record listing</a>, we see that the speed record for a seaplane set in 1931 is 655.8 km/h (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_S.6B"" rel=""noreferrer"">Supermarine S.6B</a>), while the record for a landplane set in 1935 (4 years later) is ""only"" 567.1 km/h (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-1_Racer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hughes H-1 Racer</a>). </p>

<p>Seeing how fast aviation technology developed in that period, it is remarkable that four years after the Supermarine record, the fastest landplane was still significantly slower than the fastest seaplane.</p>

<p>I would expect the large pontoons on the seaplanes to provide more drag compared to a simple landing gear, and hence by logic the seaplane should be penalised and achieve lower maximum speeds. All things being equal. </p>

<p>However, since the speed differences are so pronounced, all things obviously are not equal. So what are the differences between the two categories (or their designers and manufacturers) that can explain the gap in maximum speed?</p>
","<h2>The answer: Fixed-pitch propellers.</h2>

<p>Until the 1930s propellers were fixed pitch only. From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-pitch_propeller"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first practical controllable-pitch propeller for aircraft was
  introduced in 1932. French firm Ratier pioneered variable-pitch
  propellers of various designs from 1928 onwards, relying on a special
  ball bearing helicoïdal ramp at the root of the blades for easy
  operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means all speed records were flown with fixed-pitch propellers, which needed to be optimised to the top design speed to coax as much thrust from the engines as possible. In turn, this means that most of the propeller blade was stalled at low speed, so take-off thrust was low. To achieve high speed, a high wing loading was needed and, in combination with low thrust, the take-off length of such an aircraft was beyond of the length of airfields back then.</p>

<p>On water, however, the maximum field length is close to infinity. Yes, drag with floats is especially high when transitioning from buoyancy to dynamic lift (the ""hump""), but that can be overcome when that hump occurs at high enough speed so the propeller delivers enough thrust. </p>

Is there a method to calculate the volume of the cargo and then to design its shape?</p>
","<p>The cargo hold volume is a secondary result of the design process. Pressurized fuselages need to be round for best structural efficiency, and the passenger compartment needs to be high enough for passengers to stand upright. The rest has to follow from that, and the old narrow-body aircraft (like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DC-8</a> or the Boeing 707) were mostly volume-limited (which means that they would have benefited from more internal volume), whereas the early wide-bodied aircraft (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A300"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A300</a>, Boeing 747) are weight-limited (which means operators flew them with some volume unfilled to avoid overloading the plane).</p>

","<p>One of the main reasons wing tip tanks were used was to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_fuel_tanks#Tip_tanks"" rel=""noreferrer"">counteract some of the forces of wing bending</a> by adding mass to the end of the wings. As time has progressed and our understanding of materials has grown as well as our ability to design structures better the need for tricks like this has gone away.  </p>

<p>As our general understanding of aerodynamics has gotten better so has the understanding of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_tip"" rel=""noreferrer"">impact of wing tip shape on reducing drag</a>. As such wing tip tanks have been traded out for wing tip devices.</p>

<p>In some cases the tip tanks are an option available as a later add-on or at purchase time. Generally this increases the range of the aircraft at the cost of useful load. As such, it may just be that most people who order planes these days prefer the higher useful load and the reduced range, rather than the extended range flying with a lighter load.</p>

Throughout the flight, I could hear the airplane noise even with headphones on.</p>

<p>Suddenly before landing, everything went silent. There was no noise at all.  There was a strange silence throughout the aircraft.  Everyone was scared and looking at each other, some even started praying.</p>

<p>But we landed perfectly fine. It was like routine landing.</p>

<p>So, I want to ask, whether it was normal? Or the pilot avoided telling us something went wrong? </p>

<p>P.S. Before starting the landing process, the pilot informed about the weather being fine and said ""there's a safety manual in your seat pocket."" </p>
","<p>There's virtually no chance of the pilot deliberately switching off all 4 engines, and even less chance of all 4 engines failing at the same time. It's not entirely impossible for it to happen, but it definitely wouldn't be quietly ignored within the aviation community. I promise you that you would've heard about it afterwards.</p>

<p>That said, the A380's engines are modern, quiet, and actually mounted quite a long way out on the wings, this makes them fairly quiet when idling, even when compared to other aircraft. This is particularly noticeable after a long flight where they've been running at fairly high power for 8 or more hours, and is even more the case if you're not used to the A380, eg if you usually fly on common twins such as the A320, 737, 777 which are <strong>much</strong> louder within the cabin.</p>

<p>I suspect, but can't be sure, that the engines were simply pulled back to idle (minimum power/thrust) and it sounded much quieter than you expected.</p>

<p>But no, the engines were almost certainly not simply turned off, that just doesn't happen. The only thing I can think of that would cause that would be a flame-out, and you'd definitely notice that!</p>

"What can be logged as Total Time?","5973","","<p>The FAA regulates logging time in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=40760189a03dfea0b501608f33820a45&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#se14.2.61_151"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAR 61.51</a>. There are <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/search?q=PIC%20Time%20is%3Aquestion"">plenty of questions</a> about logging PIC time, as well as <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/8969/136"">SIC time</a>. Another type remains: what can be logged as total time? It's only mentioned once:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Total flight time or lesson time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that any time logged as dual, PIC, or SIC can be logged as total time. Is total time merely the sum of those, minus any overlap, or is there a situation where total time can be logged but none of the others?</p>

<p>In particular, two situations arise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm at the controls of an aircraft I'm not rated for (i.e. an ASEL pilot in the right seat of a multi-engine aircraft, where the other pilot is appropriately rated and not a CFI). I can't log PIC, SIC, or dual - but can I log total time?</p></li>
<li><p>In a plane I'm rated for, I pass the controls to a non-certificated passenger. I'm not a CFI. I cannot log PIC, SIC, or dual while my passenger is the sole manipulator of the controls, but I am acting as the PIC for this portion of the flight. Can I log this as total time?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>""Total time"" isn't an officially defined term as far as I know. Most people seem to use it to mean ""total flight time"", i.e. the total of their PIC, SIC and flight training time (excluding simulator training).</p>

<p>In general, you can log and count whatever you want in your logbook provided that you log at least the items required in 61.51(a):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) <em>Training time and aeronautical experience</em>. Each person must
  document and record the following time in a manner acceptable to the
  Administrator:</p>
  
  <p>(1) Training and aeronautical experience used to meet the requirements
  for a certificate, rating, or flight review of this part.</p>
  
  <p>(2) The aeronautical experience required for meeting the recent flight
  experience requirements of this part.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the bottom line is that ""total time"" is whatever you want it to be, and if you want to log 'fun time' in aircraft that you aren't qualified to fly then go ahead; the time just won't count for anything as far as the FAA is concerned.</p>

<p>As for your two scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can't log any 'FAA time' because you're not certified to fly the
aircraft as PIC or SIC, and you aren't receiving training. You might note it in your logbook for your own reasons but you can't count it towards anything for the FAA's purposes.</li>
<li>The passenger isn't certified and therefore cannot act as PIC; even if he's physically moving the controls, you're still PIC.</li>

<p>Additional Information on mechanism of elevator:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Drive System</strong></p>
  
  <p>Each lift is operated by an independent drive unit. Each drive 400-cycle, three-phase, 
  alternating current (AC) motors. Each motor is connected to a gearbox with 
  counter-rotating drive shafts and sprockets for a chain drive. The drive shafts are 
  operated by a common worm gear within the gearbox. In the
  event of one motor failure, the other motor will drive the lift at
  half-speed. Two, independent, continuous loop, bicycle-type chains taking power from the
  dual-output sprockets on the drive units actively drive each lift.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Woqdb.png"" alt=""DriveUnit""></p>
  
  <p><strong>Limit Switches</strong> </p>
  
  <p>The range of travel of the lifts is controlled by limit switches installed
  within the wire duct attached to the forward side of one of the vertical lift
  tracks. There are two sets of two limit switches for each lift:
  one set located in the service center and one set in the lower galley.
  One switch is a normal stop switch and the other limit switch is for
  overtravel in the event the normal switch fails to operate. 
  The limit switches are actuated by a cam plate mounted on the side of the lift.
  The cam plate has a machined offset to prevent actuation of the
  overtravel limit switch unless the normal switch fails to operate. In
  addition to the limit switches, mechanical stops are installed in the
  vertical lift tracks to stall and shut off the gear motors if both
  limit switches malfunction.

","<p>QNE, QNH, and QFE are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code"">Q Codes</a> - the Q Codes are designed for telegraph (or radiotelegraph) use where information is transmitted in morse code and brevity is essential (e.g. ""QNH KJFK 2992 INS"" is much shorter to tap out in morse code than ""JFK Altimeter 29.92 inches of mercury"")</p>

<p>A jet-bridge may partially deflect rainwater in some cases, but the gutter helps mitigate water exposure for the aircraft interior and passengers. Even gutters cannot completely eliminate such exposure since their size is necessarily limited by aerodynamic constraints.

<ol>
<li>Average chord length is longer, so the Reynolds number of the airflow is higher, causing relatively less friction drag.</li>
<li>Instead of three surface-fuselage-joints, the V-tail has only two, so less interference drag is created.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>A [snowflake] -XX°C icon will be incrementally added to airport approach plates, beginning Mar 5, 2015. The
  icon indicates a cold temperature altitude correction will be required on an approach when the reported
  temperature is, “at or below” the temperature specified for that airport. </p>

<p>This looks to be a work-in-progress, as they started adding the icons in March, and compliance with applying the cold temperature altitude corrections becomes mandatory in September, 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> In response to aviation industry concerns over cold weather altimetry errors, the FAA
  conducted a risk analysis to determine if current 14 CFR Part 97 instrument approach procedures, in the
  United States National Airspace System, place aircraft at risk during cold temperature operations. This study
  applied the coldest recorded temperature at the given airports in the last five years and specifically determined
  if there was a probability that during these non-standard day operations, anticipated altitude errors in a
  barometric altimetry system could exceed the Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC) used on procedure
  segment altitudes. If a probability, of the ROC being exceeded, went above one percent on a segment of the
  approach, a temperature restriction was applied to that segment. In addition to the low probability that these
  procedures will be required, the probability of the ROC being exceeded precisely at an obstacle position is
  extremely low, providing an even greater safety margin.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Action:</strong>
  Pilots must make an altitude correction to the published, “at”, “at or above” and “at or below” altitudes on
  designated segment(s) (see list below), on all published procedures and runways, when the reported airport
  temperature is at or below the published airport cold temperature restriction. </p>
  
  <p>Pilots <strong><em>without</em></strong> temperature compensating aircraft are responsible to calculate and make a manual cold
  temperature altitude correction to the designated segment(s) of the approach using the AIM 7-2-3, ICAO Cold
  Temperature Error Table.</p>
  
  <p>Pilots <strong><em>with</em></strong> temperature compensating aircraft must ensure the system is on and operating for each segment
  requiring an altitude correction. Pilots must ensure they are flying at corrected altitude. If the system is not
  operating, the pilot is responsible to calculate and apply a manual cold weather altitude correction using the
  AIM 7-2-3 ICAO Cold Temperature Error Table. PILOTS SHOULD NOT MAKE AN ALTIMETER
  CHANGE to accomplish an altitude correction.</p>
  
  <p>Pilots must use the corrected MDA or DA/DH as the minimum for an approach. Pilots must meet the
  requirements in 14 CFR Part 91.175 in order to operate below the corrected MDA or DA/DH. Pilots must
  see and avoid obstacles when descending below the MDA.</p>
  
  <p>The temperature restriction at a “Cold Temperature Restricted Airport” is mutually exclusive from the charted
  temperature restriction published for “uncompensated baro-VNAV systems” on 14 CFR Part 97 RNAV
  (GPS) and RNAV (RNP) approach plates. The charted temperature restriction for uncompensated
  baro-VNAV systems is applicable to the final segment LNAV/VNAV minima. The charted temperature
  restriction must be followed regardless of the cold temperature restricted airport temperature.</p>

","<p>The four-digit transponder code that is entered by a pilot is an <strong>octal</strong> number rather than a decimal number, and in the octal numbering system, only the digits 0-7 are valid.</p>

<p>As far as <strong>why</strong>, internally it's actually a 12-bit binary number and octal works really well since can be used as a ""shortcut"" for entering groups of three binary digits at a time (000 - 111, which is 0-7 in octal).</p>

<p>If it were designed today, with the additional computing power and software complexity available, it would be possible to use a decimal number even if it is stored as binary internally, just so that it is more familiar.  At the time that the system was created though, changing the dials directly set the code in hardware and doing the conversion would have been much more complex / difficult / expensive.</p>

<p>In short, it was convenient for the engineers and manufacturers, and just an oddity for the end users, so they left it that way.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about built-in redundant systems like a second radio, but rather actual physical spare parts. For example, a car carries a spare tyre.</p>
","<p>South African Airways flights to 'less developed' locations in Africa often carry a mechanic and some spares on board. If there are no suitable repair facilities, supplies or maintenance personnel available at the destination, then their own guy can fix any minor mechanical issues. If there's a major problem then they would have to fly in additional repair supplies and staff (and fly out the stranded passengers).</p>

<p>I found this out on a flight from Johannesberg to Lilongwe (Malawi). A seat was broken in the passenger cabin and SAA's on-board mechanic was able to fix it after a short delay. The captain explained briefly why he was on board.</p>

<p>I assume that other airlines or operators who operate in undeveloped areas would do the same. It's a lot cheaper to carry a mechanic and a few spares than it is to have an aircraft, crew and passengers stranded. If anything on the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/12070/62"">MEL</a> is broken then an airliner isn't airworthy so even a 'minor' issue can ground it.</p>

"What is the reason for changing the speed reference (IAS or Mach number) with altitude?","5904","","<p>Inspired by that question: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/35391/how-is-the-airspeed-mach-number-transition-handled-in-modern-airliners"">How is the airspeed-Mach number transition handled in modern airliners?</a></p>

<p>When pressure and density decrease IAS also decreases. When temperature and pressure/density decrease speed of sound also decreases. As air pressure, density and temperature all decrease with altitude, if one fly a constant IAS or a constant Mach number while constantly climbing or descending, the aircraft actually constantly accelerates or slows relative to the air mass.</p>

<p>But at lower cruise altitude an aircraft will be piloted to maintain a constant IAS, while at upper cruise altitude a constant Mach will be flown.</p>

<p>What is the reason for changing the speed reference (IAS or Mach number)?</p>
","<p>Aircraft are limited by both air speed (VMO, affects loads on the structures) and Mach (MMO, formation of shock waves resulting in buffet).</p>

<p>At low altitudes, the speed of sound is high so an aircraft is most limited by indicated airspeed (IAS). At higher altitudes, the speed of sound is lower so the aircraft will be limited by Mach number. Aircraft typically fly towards the upper limit of their speed, so at some point they will have to switch from remaining under the IAS limit to remaining under the Mach limit.</p>

<p>The chart below shows the changes in different speeds as altitude increases, assuming standard atmosphere.</p>

<p>The aircraft climbs at 250 kias from sea level. An acceleration from 250 to 300 kias is included at 10,000 feet. You can see that as IAS is held constant, TAS (True Airspeed) and Mach both increase.</p>

<p>The switch from 300 IAS to Mach 0.76 is done at FL280. You can see the Mach speed is approaching its MMO. From this point, both TAS and IAS decrease. After the tropopause, around 35000 feet, temperature stops decreasing and TAS remains nearly constant.</p>

<p>At FL400 the aircraft levels off and cruises at Mach 0.765, and a step climb to FL410 is included at this speed to show the trends there.</p>

<p>Now it looks like there's little to no risk of the two aircraft colliding and there's already more than enough space to stop the aircraft, so why can't a controller use their judgement to be able to clear the aircraft behind to land? It seems like that it's a waste of time when you know that there's going to be more than ample time for the previous aircraft to turn off, so what's the problem with that?</p>
","<p>Actually, the FAA doesn't always require the preceding airplane to clear the runway if they have the required separation unless it is dark (when it is very hard to visually estimate distances).</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0310.html"">FAA Air Traffic Control Order Section 10. Arrival Procedures and Separation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3-10-6. ANTICIPATING SEPARATION</p>
  
  <p>a. Landing clearance to succeeding aircraft in a landing sequence need
  not be withheld if you observe the positions of the aircraft and
  determine that prescribed runway separation will exist when the
  aircraft crosses the landing threshold. Issue traffic information to
  the succeeding aircraft if a preceding arrival has not been previously
  reported and when traffic will be departing prior to their arrival.</p>
  
  <p>EXAMPLE- “American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land,
  number two following a United Seven-Thirty-Seven two mile final.
  Traffic will depart prior to your arrival.”</p>
  
  <p>“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic
  will depart prior to your arrival.”</p>
  
  <p>NOTE- Landing sequence number is optional at tower facilities where
  the arrival sequence to the runway is established by the approach
  control.</p>
  
  <p>b. Anticipating separation must not be applied when conducting LUAW
  operations, except as authorized in paragraph 3-10-5b2. Issue
  applicable traffic information when using this provision.</p>
  
  <p>EXAMPLE- “American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land.

<p>And the separation is specified in the same document:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3-10-3. SAME RUNWAY SEPARATION</p>
  
  <p>a. Separate an arriving aircraft from another aircraft using the same

  landing threshold until one of the following conditions exists or
  unless authorized in para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.</p>

"During descent, why do my ears hurt, but only sometimes?","5894","","<p>Sometimes during descents or landings, my ears hurt. However, during takeoffs I never had any pain although my ears feel different, but it is not pain.</p>

<p>I am not looking for a medical-related answer. I do not experience pain during <strong>all</strong> descents or landings, but only on some.</p>

<p>Is it because of pilot's skills, or rate of descent or some other aviation-related issue?</p>
","<p>As a plane climbs out, the cabin pressure lowers so that it equals the same pressure as being at about 5,000 feet, the altitude of Denver. What happens inside your ear is that the pressure in the middle ear reduces to match the 5,000 foot cabin pressure, and you might sometime feel your ears ""pop,"" just like going up in an elevator in a tall building.</p>

<p>When the plane descends, the pressure in your middle ear will still be at 5,000 feet, but the pressure in the cabin will go down to sea level (0 feet), and you will feel this pressure on your eardrum, which can cause a lot of discomfort until the pressure equalizes.</p>

<p>The pressure equalizes as air enters the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eustachian</a> tubes, which connect your middle ear to your nose and throat. The tube, however, is very narrow and can be blocked by inflammation or mucus due to a cold or other illness, and you won't be able to equalize the pressure. Flying with a cold can be very painful during descent.</p>

<p>The amount of discomfort each passenger experiences is going to vary widely, even from flight-to-flight. For example, if the cabin altitude is 5,000ft and the destination is Denver, then the cabin will not have to further pressurize.  Some other factors are individual physiology (some people will have bigger eustachian tubes than others), illness, ethnicity/gender/gift-of-gab (some are more prone to talking than others, and talking can relieve the pressure), etc.</p>

<p>As a pilot, there are two things you can do: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>buy a plane with a lower cabin altitude. I recommend the Gulfstream 650, which has a cabin pressure of 2,765ft at an altitude of 41,000MSL</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the rates of your descents, which will give your ears a chance to equalize. ATC, however, <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0404.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">expects you to descend at between 500 and 1,500FPM</a>, unless you are given ""AT PILOTS DISCRETION."" </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few different ways to equalize the pressure. The most effective is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">valsava maneuver</a>, which is how some scuba divers equalize the pressure as they descend into the water. Alternatively, yawning, chewing gum, sucking on hard candy, or hyperextending your jaw may help. Little children are particularly susceptible to discomfort, and parents will give them gum or candy at the beginning of the descent.</p>

The first instance of these helicopter ""dogfights"" occurred on the first day of the war (22 September 1980): two Iranian SeaCobras crept up on two Mi-25s and hit them with TOW wire-guided anti-tank missiles. One Mi-25 went down immediately, the other was badly damaged and crashed before reaching base. The Iranians won a similar air battle on 24 April 1981, destroying two Mi-25s without incurring losses themselves. According to unclassified documents, Iranian pilots achieved a 10-to-1 kill ratio over the Iraqi helicopter pilots during these engagements and even engaged Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These would be pretty loosely classified as a ""dogfight"" since the Iranian AH-1J's ""crept up"" on the Mi-25's. It is doubtful that the Mi's did any kind of evasive maneuvering or that the AH's did any kind of aggressive pursuits, but it is air-to-air combat between helicopters.</p>

<p>The page from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_Mi-24#Iraq_War_.28March_2003.E2.80.932011.29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mi-24 page</a> gives a little more detailed report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This war also saw the only confirmed air-to-air helicopter battles in history with the Iraqi Mi-25s flying against Iranian AH-1J SeaCobras (supplied by the United States before the Iranian Revolution) on several separate occasions. In November 1980, not long after Iraq's initial invasion of Iran, two Iranian SeaCobras engaged two Mi-25s with TOW wire-guided antitank missiles. One Mi-25 went down immediately, the other was badly damaged and crashed before reaching base. The Iranians repeated this accomplishment on 24 April 1981, destroying two Mi-25s without incurring losses to themselves. One Mi-25 was also downed by an IRIAF F-14A.</p>
  
  <p>The Iraqis hit back, claiming the destruction of a SeaCobra on 14 September 1983 (with YaKB machine gun), then three SeaCobras on 5 February 1984 and three more on 25 February 1984 (two with Falanga missiles, one with S-5 rockets). After a lull in helicopter losses, each side lost a gunship on 13 February 1986. Later, a Mi-25 claimed a SeaCobra shot down with YaKB gun on 16 February, and a SeaCobra claimed a Mi-25 shot down with rockets on 18 February. The last engagement between the two types was on 22 May 1986, when Mi-25s shot down a SeaCobra. The final claim tally was 10 SeaCobras and 6 Mi-25s destroyed. The relatively small numbers and the inevitable disputes over actual kill numbers makes it unclear if one gunship had a real technical superiority over the other. Iraqi Mi-25s also claimed 43 kills against other Iranian helicopters, such as Agusta-Bell UH-1 Hueys.</p>

<p>Given the all the other advances in aircraft design between the past and current generation of airliners, why has the ceiling remained unchanged?</p>
","<p>Mainly, the optimum cruise altitude is where thrust and lift requirements for both take-off and cruise balance well. An additional benefit is the colder air which increases the <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1609/why-do-jet-engines-get-better-fuel-efficiency-at-high-altitudes"">efficiency of heat engines</a>. Since this helpful drop in temperature ceases once the aircraft climbs above the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tropopause</a>, the benefits of flying higher increase most below the tropopause.</p>

<p>With increasing flight altitude, the airliner needs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bigger engines to create the needed thrust in thinner air</li>
<li>Bigger wings to create the needed lift</li>
</ol>

<p>With the wings, the size of the tailplanes will also grow; this effect alone likely will weigh more than the beefing up of the fuselage structure for the increased cabin pressure. Flying higher will make almost all parts bigger and heavier.</p>

<p>Note that <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11936/are-we-at-peak-speed-efficiency-for-jet-airliners-at-mach-0-85/11948#11948"">Mach 0.85 is a hard limit</a> for efficient flight; airliners cannot compensate for lower density by flying faster. The only way to allow higher flight levels is to attach bigger wings and tails.</p>

<p>Another consideration is Breguet's formula: Jet aircraft have their <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3612/how-does-wind-affect-the-airspeed-that-i-should-fly-for-maximum-range-in-an-airp/3623#3623"">optimum cruise lift coefficient</a> at a value of $c_L = \sqrt{0.6\cdot c_{D0}\cdot\pi\cdot AR\cdot\epsilon}$, if we assume the thrust of high-bypass-ratio engines to vary with speed proportional to $v^{-0.5}$, which is a reasonable assumption. This means the airliner cannot fly higher by flying at a higher lift coefficient: This would decrease efficiency.</p>

<p>(Nomenclature: $c_{D0}$ = zero-lift drag, $AR$ = wing aspect ratio, $\epsilon$ = span efficiency)</p>

<p>With the wing size and the engines needed for flight at Mach 0.82 in the tropopause (Mach 0.85 is really not as efficient; follow <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11936/are-we-at-peak-speed-efficiency-for-jet-airliners-at-mach-0-85/11948#11948"">the link</a> to find out why this is the quoted cruise speed for long-range airliners), the take-off distance is quite reasonable and approximately matches the airports which had been defined by NATO during the cold war. Flying any higher into the stratosphere would increase the aircraft's mass due to bigger engines and wings, but would not incur the efficiency gains of increasing cruise altitude in the troposphere, where temperature drops with altitude.</p>

<p>Conversely, picking a lower design cruise altitude would allow to make both wings and engines smaller, but this would translate into:</p>

<ol>
<li>Higher take-off and landing speeds, and critical speeds during take-off due to the smaller wing,</li>
<li>Lower take-off acceleration due to smaller engines,</li>
<li>For twins: Not enough thrust during take-off when one engine fails,</li>
<li>Lower climb speeds, so it would take longer to reach cruise altitude, and</li>
<li>Not fully taking advantage of the cold air up in the tropopause.</li>
</ol>

<p>Designing for a lower cruise altitude would translate into much longer runways and less efficient flight overall.</p>

<p>Designing for cruise in the tropopause is simply the sweet spot for airliner designers where all conditions match well and produce a balanced outcome.</p>

"Why are ""counterweights"" used in aircraft production?","5885","","<p>From <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/35344/reasoning-behind-using-depleted-uranium-as-ballast-in-the-747"">this question</a>, manufacturers use ""counterweight"" or ""ballast"" when producing aircraft. Why is the use of weight necessary? Supposedly aircraft should be made as light as possible, and counterweight is just dead weight without any function.</p>

<p>I presume it is used to balance some centre of gravity, but why would that be necessary? With industrialized factories, components can be engineered to great accuracy, so a case-by-case adjustment to account for manufacturing errors should not be needed.</p>
","<p>The counterweights in the original question were from a Boeing 747 rudder, so I will explain what their purpose is. John Walter's answer covers all applications of balances and ballast well enough, so I just want to explain why control surfaces need balances.</p>

<p>The short answer is: To bring the center of gravity on or even ahead of the elastic line of the control surface in order to limit gust loads and suppress flutter. The same is achieved for the full wing when <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/25636/why-are-modern-regional-jet-designs-shifting-towards-under-wing-engines/25640#25640"">jet engines are placed ahead of the wing</a>.</p>

<p>First consider an aileron <strong>without</strong> a balancing mass. Its elastic axis is the hinge line and its center of gravity is maybe at a third of its chord, so it sits aft of the elastic axis. Now imagine what happens when the aircraft to which this aileron is attached flies through a positive gust: The wing bends up and inertial loads will keep the aileron from moving up with the wing. However, since it is attached to the wing at the hinge, its forward edge will be pulled up, resulting in a positive aileron deflection. This adds local camber and increases local lift, so the bending motion is intensified. At some point the wing stops moving up and the stored elastic energy reverses the bending motion: The wing starts to move down, and again will the aileron lag behind, now reducing local lift and again intensifying the bending motion. Watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RenbFgLZBNA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this movie</a> to see the resulting motion (the scary stuff starts at 2:40):</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RenbFgLZBNA?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Now you might argue that in the 747 strong hydraulic cylinders keep the aileron from moving: Right, but still there is enough elasticity in the control system to let the aileron move a few degrees, which is enough to amplify the bending motion. The glider in the movie had high-aspect ratio wings of a rather elastic material (glassfiber-epoxy), so it flutters at a low speed where the energies and frequencies are low. Nevertheless, after the movie was filmed it had to be overhauled: The control fittings were almost completely worn out.</p>

<p>Now consider the same arrangement, but <strong>with</strong> balancing mass: The aileron will either stay neutral, if its center of gravity is in the elastic line, or will even counter the bending motion if the center of gravity is ahead of the hinge line. Both peak loads and flutter risk will be reduced. More agreeable control forces are just a side effect; the main reason is to keep the control surfaces or even the whole wing from breaking off.</p>

<p>The mechanism is the same for the rudder, but here the elasticity comes from the long fuselage tube which will be twisted by the side loads on the vertical tail. Again, only with enough balancing mass will the self-reinforcing nature of a twisting fuselage that swings the vertical tail left and right be avoided. </p>

"What can airline pilots do if they are no longer in the position to fly, career-wise?","5882","","<p>I was having a discussion with a friend about the incident in the past days (4U 9525) and more specifically the what could be described as 'Taboo' of Psychological problems among pilots. We came across a few points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They will only reluctantly admit that something is wrong, since risk losing their Medical (hence being 'grounded'). It will only be easier to loose and harder to get back I suspect after this event. </p></li>
<li><p>At least for the younger bunch who might have difficulties they will have substantial debt from training that is difficult to pay off. Furthermore, they will have worked hard to get where they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Any airline that does suspect something will most probably not allow them near the cockpit again. Should anything happen the airline will be held to blame, since they did allow him to fly despite knowing of the problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This brings up the question: <strong>What can a pilot do, career-wise, if they feel they are unable to exercise the profession?</strong> It seems pretty cornered to me. Perhaps work in dispatch/ network control was the only one I figured their knowledge could come to use. Switching to the simulator I suspect might also be possible, but not for the younger individuals.</p>
","<p>When I worked in the design department of an aircraft company, I had two types of coworkers: Those with and those without a pilot's license. You could easily spot the difference. In aircraft-related engineering decisions it was soon obvious. I mightily preferred to work with other pilots - they would have a much better grasp of ""what looks about right"" and not pursue hare-brained, outlandish ideas.</p>

<p>See it this way: All managers in car companies have a driver's license, so they have at least some contact with what their companies make. All higher managers where I worked had <strong>no</strong> pilot's license, and it made work outright awful. They were trained as beancounters, and that restricted their viewpoint. They were simply incapable of telling good engineering from bad.</p>

<p>If you have managed to get a CPL, adding an engineering degree on top is not hard. That is my advice to grounded pilots: Go to engineering school and enrich the workforce with your experience.</p>

  <p>The gust alleviation system picks off the stick displacement signal

</blockquote>

<p>As a layman I am not sure I fully understand this, so my question is, what is the gust alleviation system?</p>
","<p>A gust alleviation system is a control system fitted to some Fly-by-wire (FBW) aircraft that reduces the effect of gust loads on the aircraft by deflecting control surfaces such as ailerons, rudder and elevators. </p>

<p>The system works by measuring the upward acceleration of the aircraft and comparing that with the acceleration commanded by the (auto)pilot. A feedback loop adds a correction signal to the signals controlling the deflection of the control surfaces in order to counteract the accelerations cause by wind gusts. </p>

<p>In its simplest form the accelerations are sensed near the center of gravity of the aircraft. More advanced implementations work with multiple sensors in the body and in the wings. These gust alleviation systems do not only attempt to annul the effect of the gusts on the aircraft's normal (upward) acceleration, they also reduce the wing bending moments. This is turn reduces metal fatigue.</p>

<p>In the A380 the load alleviation system is nicknamed ""valse des aileron"" (Waltz of the Ailerons) because of the dancing movements of the aileron:</p>

"Could airliners use a steam or electric powered catapult for take-off?","5841","","<p>This would have the obvious benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less runway needed to take-off</li>
<li>Fuel savings </li>
<li>Faster turn around times for airlines</li>
</ul>

<p>Could this be implemented in busy airports?</p>
","<p>Let's see what the savings are:</p>

<p>A mid-sized airliner carries maybe 20% of its mass in fuel. This fuel has an energy density of 43 MJ per kg. Of that chemical energy at most 40% is converted into useable work. Heck, let's make this 25% so we are really conservative. Thus, the energy for the whole trip is $$E_{\text{trip}} = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 43,000,000 \, \frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{kg}} \cdot \text{mass} = 2,150,000 \, \frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{kg}} \cdot \text{mass}$$</p>

<p>Now assume that this airliner saves the energy to accelerate from 0 to 150 knots by using a catapult. This energy is $$E_{\text{accel}} = \frac{v_{\text{takeoff}}^2 - v_0^2}{2} \cdot \text{mass} = 2,977.35 \,  \frac{\mathrm{m}^2}{\mathrm{s}^2} \cdot \text{mass}$$</p>

<p>Since I picked metric units, conversion is easy: $1 \, \mathrm{J} = 1 \, \mathrm{Ws} = 1 \, \frac{\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2}{\mathrm{s}^2}$. I use $\text{mass}$ for the take-off mass so you don't think it is the unit meter. Now let's put that into proportion:
$$\frac{E_{\text{accel}}}{E_{\text{trip}}} = 0.001385$$</p>

<p>Using the catapult saves 0.1385% of the energy needed to fly a typical airliner trip. Granted, it is more for short-range flights, but still insignificant to what is needed to move the aircraft 10 km up into the sky and then for a couple of hundred miles through the air at Mach 0.8.</p>

<p>To make a catapult launch feasible, you need to add some strength to the nose gear and the forward fuselage. The typical landing gear fraction of the take-off mass is about 3%, and the nose gear is 10% - 15% of that, so $m_{\text{nosegear}} = 0.00375 \cdot \text{mass}$. Relative to the nose gear mass, the fuel saving from using a catapult launch is $\frac{0.0003462032}{0.00375} = 0.37$ or 37% of the nose gear mass. Thus, the reinforcements need to add less than 37% to the mass of the nose gear.</p>

<p>If we assume an acceleration of ½ g = 4.903 m/s², the take-off run to accelerate to 150 kts is 607 m. I expect that even this moderate acceleration (which requires a pulling force of half of the lift at take-off) would translate into much higher mass increases than those 37% of the nose gear mass.</p>

"How do friendly stealth planes locate each other?","5836","","<p>Stealth planes can't be seen (very well) on radar. So one stealth plane should be unable to locate another stealth plane on its radar and vice versa.</p>

<p>So how would one stealth plane locate another, friendly, stealth plane?</p>
","<p>The accounts that have been published of F-117 missions indicate that they generally flew single-ship, rather than formation missions, and it seems probable that B-2 aircraft do likewise.  So in a sense, the important question for those aircraft isn't ""how do I know where (another stealth aircraft operating nearby) IS,"" but ""how do I ensure that we don't collide with each other,"" and that's a much easier question.</p>

<p>There are several ways to ""deconflict"" multiple aircraft operating in relatively close proximity that don't involve seeing or painting each other on radar.  One aircraft operates at one altitude, another operates at a different altitude is one method, while timing over a point (you get to waypoint ABC no later than 19:00:00, and I'll be there no sooner than 19:00:30) is another, and physical separation (you stay west of this longitude line, I stay east) is another.  In practice, all of these can be combined to ensure that ""your"" mission is deconflicted from ""my"" mission.</p>

<p>Of note, it isn't only stealth aircraft that will use tactics like this.  Helicopters operating blacked out at night don't have air-to-air radar, and even with NVG's, the ability to see each other isn't reliable enough to plan on ""see and avoid"" and the ""big sky theory"" to preclude a mid-air, so they'll use some fairly detailed deconfliction plans incorporating separation in space and time.</p>

<p>More recent stealth aircraft such as the F-22 and F-35 are <a href=""http://www.f22fighter.com/avionics.htm#2.4%20Inter%20/%20Intra-Flight%20Data%20Link%20(IFDL)"">reported</a> to have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_Advanced_Data_Link"">datalink</a> capabilities so that they can ""see"" each other without radar, by means of an encrypted, stealthy broadcast of each aircraft's position and track.  This would allow multiple aircraft to fly in formation (not close formation, but perhaps 1000' or more apart), and to work with other aircraft equipped with the same datalink, so even though the bad guys would only be able to see the non-stealth aircraft on radar, the friendlies could all see each other.</p>

","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The Sequenced Flashing Lights are part of some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approach_lighting_system"">approach lighting systems</a> and are a row of strobe lights that flash in sequence to direct the pilots eyes to the runway.  They are useful in conditions of bad weather, as they quickly catch the eye and help the pilot locate the runway threshold which might otherwise be hidden; however, during normal operations they can actually be distracting.  These lights appear to run towards the runway and are often called chasers, the rabbit, or the running rabbit.</p>

<p><strong>Kill the Wabbit</strong></p>

<p>Because these lights are very bright, and often distracting during normal operations in clear weather, it is not uncommon to hear pilots ask the controllers to <em>kill the w/rabbit</em> on their approach.

<ol>
<li>What are the important criteria taken into consideration by engineers?</li>
<li>Are engineers really happy with the result today? Would they make other choices if the technology or any other current limits could be improved?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: From the current answers, and other readings online, these elements influence the flight altitude in a certain way:</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<ul>
<li>Engine efficiency / cost</li>
<li>Airframe efficiency / cost</li>
</ul>

<p>Which leads to details including (not limited):</p>

<ul>
<li>Thrust / TAS variation with air temperature and density</li>
<li>Mach effects, RAM effects</li>
<li>Airfoil efficiency / drag, angle of attack</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.gpsarc.ncu.edu.tw/ncu/current.php"">Tropopause height</a> variations</li>
<li>Cabin pressure differential</li>
<li>Certification regulation and associated costs</li>
<li>Weather / icing, visibility, radio propagation</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to understand which ones are most relevant and how the compromise is made.</p>
","<p>There are multiple factors that affect an aircraft based on its cruise altitude.</p>

<p>The cruise altitude directly affects the aircraft pressurization and aerodynamics. In order to keep the cabin altitude around 6000 to 8000 feet, the fuselage would have to withstand a higher pressure differential. This would require more material, and make the plane heavier. Newer materials used on the 787 and A350 handle these loads better, which allows a higher pressure differential and larger windows.</p>

<p>The altitude also affects the aerodynamics. Aircraft typically cruise at a certain Mach number at high altitudes. The indicated airspeed for a certain Mach number gets lower with higher altitude. This can result in lower drag, but poses challenges as the airspeed drops lower. See: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/9188/1696"">What determines the maximum altitude a plane can reach?</a></p>

<p>Also, see <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/12569/1696"">the answer by Peter Kämpf</a> for more detail about the aerodynamic aspects.</p>

<p>At higher altitudes, less air is available for the engines, reducing the available power. Along with this there are efficiency benefits. See: <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/1609/1696"">Why do jet engines get better fuel efficiency at high altitudes?</a></p>

<p>As <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/12555/1696"">the answer by Ghillie Dhu</a> explains, those benefits stop increasing around FL360.</p>

<p>The lack of breathable oxygen and increased pressure forces on the fuselage caused by the lower air pressure also lead to greater risks, resulting in tighter regulations on aircraft intending to fly higher. These regulations will add additional cost to flying higher, affecting decisions on service ceilings.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title14-vol1/xml/CFR-2011-title14-vol1-sec25-365.xml"" rel=""noreferrer"">§ 25.365</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>So for planes operating over 45,000 feet, the structure must be able to withstand an even higher pressure load factor.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title14-vol1/xml/CFR-2011-title14-vol1-sec25-1441.xml"" rel=""noreferrer"">§ 25.1441</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) The airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin pressure altitude that exceeds the following after decompression from any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable:<br>
  (i) Twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet for more than 2 minutes; or<br>
  (ii) Forty thousand (40,000) feet for any duration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cabin altitude is not allowed to exceed 40,000 feet under any condition that isn't extremely improbable. The higher the plane flies, the more difficult this will be to certify.</p>

<p>Business jets tend to have higher cruise altitudes, because the smaller structure is easier to reinforce for higher pressures, and typically sees fewer load cycles. Efficiency is also not as important as speed and comfort, so some weight can be spared for the stronger fuselage. The higher altitude also affords more flexibility in routing since most other traffic including commercial airliners are cruising at lower altitudes. Business jets may also be certified under less-stringent regulations.</p>

  change in company name or status; British Airways uses BOAC's old

"What energy density is required for the batteries in order to make an all-electric analogue of the Cessna 150 or similar plane?","5745","","<p>I think I have some general understanding that at the present moment even with the best possible batteries, a 2 seater training aircraft (like the C-150) would be very impractical. I'm not even talking about electric analogs of the Piper Seneca, let alone airliners. At the same time, compared to piston engines, electric engines are less heavy for their output and far more efficient (I think around 90+ %). Pipistrel claims that Siemens has a 85kW engine which is only 14 kg. I also like the idea that electric engines offer us some flexibility in the energy distribution.</p>

<p>What sort of progress do we need in terms of energy density of current batteries, to make a 2-4 seater aircraft real and equivalent in terms of range and performance to its piston analogues? Also, will it be cheaper to charge as opposed to the cost of liquid fuel? (Assuming the electric engine is similar to a piston one in terms of power.)</p>
","<p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>

<p>Batteries would need to be somewhere around 16.7MJ/kg to give the same range and performance as liquid fuels, this is about 18.5 times the capacity of the best lithium-ion batteries. Price-wise it will cost about 30-35% to charge your airplane as opposed to fill it with liquid fuels at today's prices.  </p>

<p><strong>Long Answer</strong></p>

<p>This is a good question which is hard to give an exact answer to, so this will be more of a Fermi Approximation. To answer this you need to look at the energy contained in the fuel and the efficiency of the engine used. </p>

<p>Looking at the energy of the fuel I will use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Specific Energy</a>, which is the energy stored in a material per unit of mass. Specific Energy is related to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Energy Density</a>, which is the amount of energy contained per unit of volume. Often the terms are interchanged. </p>

<p>The specific energy of avgas and jet fuel is about 43 MJ/kg. The best lithium-ion batteries top out at about 0.9 MJ/kg (the batteries in a Tesla are about 0.7 MJ/kg), so they have a fraction of the storage of liquid fuels. The best battery technology in theoretical development (Lithium-air) has a theoretical maximum of 41 MJ/kg, more realistically they'll get 1/4 to 1/3 of that from the technology, which is still vast. </p>

<p>Internal combustion engines are about 35% efficient, the other 65% is wasted whereas electric engines are much closer to 90% efficient or more.</p>

<p>There are other factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Weight: fuel tanks, piping and pumps take weight, and electric motors are much lighter than internal combustion engines. The batteries would need a storage structure but an electric system would probably be lighter overall</li>
<li>Battery inconsistencies: avgas supplies a consistent amount of energy in every single drop whereas batteries will sag as they discharge (this is regulated to give consistent power to the motor, however at some point levels will drop below what is regulatable, so not all the power in the batteries will be usable). Also, over time they lose capacity and become less efficient. Both these factors mean that you'd want to build in extra battery capacity to compensate</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm going to assume these two will compensate for each other, the weight savings from going electric will be offset by the need for extra capacity to ensure consistency. Assuming that all other factors are equal (propeller efficiency, etc) we can extrapolate the actual efficiency of the systems to get an approximate figure of an internal combustion on avgas: 35% of 43 MJ/kg = 15 MJ/kg of actual benefit. We can use that figure to determine what specific energy we would need from batteries to get the same amount by dividing by electric motor efficiency: 15 MJ/kg / 0.9 we get <strong>16.7 MJ/kg</strong>. </p>

<p>So batteries would need to store 16.7 MJ/kg to give us the same energy as liquid fuels, but how does it compare to existing battery tech? Right now commercially available battery technology is about 0.9 MJ/kg, so it would need <strong>18.56</strong> times more storage capacity (16.7 / 0.9 = 18.56) to supply the same amount of energy. </p>

<p>As for energy costs this is going to vary a lot depending on fuel and electricity prices over time and place; we can use some of the same figures above to work the numbers. I'll assume an airplane that holds 40 US Gallons (150 liters) as the math is easy and it's about the capacity of a Cessna 172. I'm going to do separate calculations for the US and UK to see how they compare:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the US: Avgas is about \$5.20 per US gallon at the moment, that's \$208 to fill up your airplane of 40 gals. Avgas has about 34.2 MJ/liter of energy, multiply that by 150 liters for 5130 MJ of energy. Internal combustion engines are 35% efficient and electric engines 90%, so we can calculate that an electric airplane would need 5130 * 0.35 / 0.9 =  1995 MJ of electrical power to fill up. 1995 MJ is about 554 kWh, at somewhere around \$0.135 per kWh it would cost you \$75 to charge an airplane with the same amount of energy.</li>
<li>In the UK: Avgas in the UK is about \$2.23 per liter (\$8.47 per US Gallon (ouch!)), so it would cost \$334.50 to fill up an airplane. 554 kWh of electricity costs about \$0.17 per kWh, so it would cost \$94 to charge the airplane</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I did consider the efficiency gain from weight loss as fuel is burned, i.e. a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-mass_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">variable mass system</a>, I left it out of the answer as it isn't significant compared to the other factors in what is already an approximation. It has to do with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_fraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fuel fraction</a>, which is the percentage of the aircraft weight that is fuel, which on a light piston single is comparatively low. A Cessna 172 carries about 40 gallons of fuel, 38 of which is usable, weighing about 228 pounds as opposed to a typical take-off weight of 2200-2300 lbs. In other words its fuel fraction is about 10%, even on a long range flight using every bit of fuel you will only lose 10% of your weight, and I would approximate that you'd get around 5% benefit from it. This was not enough of a factor compared to the other considerations, and it would probably be offset by regenerative descents where the electric motor actually generates power from the spinning prop. </p>

<p>For airplanes where a more significant portion of the weight is fuel, i.e. a higher fuel fraction, efficiency gains from variable mass is a much more significant factor, for example an A380's fuel fraction is 44%. </p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>isn't the cost directly proportional to speed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<ol>
<li>Most fuel can be saved by flying <em>higher</em> because the lower air density reduces parasite drag. Provided the trip is long enough for the saving at altitude to offset the cost of getting there.</li>
<li>Aircraft drag has two components. The parasite drag which increases with speed and the induced drag which decreases. So they have a point of minimum drag and for jet airliners it's typically somewhere between 200 and 250 knots <em>indicated</em>. Flying any slower would increase the cost. At the altitude where jets normally fly, the true speed is significantly higher than indicated speed.</li>
<li>For jet engines, the fuel burned is roughly proportional to <em>thrust</em> they generate and at higher thrust <em>lower</em> per unit of thrust. Since power is thrust times speed, this translate to much better efficiency at higher speed. So a jet wants to fly slightly faster than their lowest drag point.</li>
<li>Even if the trip cost is higher, higher speed allows you to make more trips, so the fixed costs get split over more passengers. So it makes sense to fly slightly faster than the lowest fuel burn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally airliners are operated at the point of lowest cost. For long trips where it pays off to climb high, jets are most efficient. For short trips, turboprops are often used that can't climb that high, but are more efficient at lower altitudes and speeds.</p>

"Are the first solo flights by a student pilot more dangerous?","5728","","<p>The first solo flight is a nail-biting moment, not only for the student pilot, but also for the flight instructor who's sending him off.  In theory not having a CFI reduces the margin of safety compared to flights with an instructor (at the same point in a student's training).  I've also heard stories about mistakes and even crashes on first solo flights, and according to <a href=""http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8834933"">""Crashes of instructional flights""</a> by Baker, Lamb, Li, and Dodd, solo flights account for about half of instructional flight crashes.</p>

<p>Yet even though the biggest safety measure- a CFI- is gone, are these student solo flights really more dangerous?  Are there any studies on accident rate among low time GA pilots vs (solo) students?  Also, are incidents more common in the first solo flights than at other parts of a student's pilot training? </p>
","<p>There is no evidence to back the claim that the first solo ride of the student is more dangerous compared to the later ones. </p>

<p>US NIH conducted a study on the accidents with solo pilots, which doesn't indicate that first-time solo fliers are any more prone to accident than others. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19750877"">Aircraft accidents with student pilots flying solo: analysis of 390 cases</a> by  Sjir Uitdewilligen and Alexander Johan de Voogt analyzed NTSB probable cause reports of 390 crashes that occurred in the period 2001 – 2005, concluding that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Student pilots flying solo show fewer injuries and fatalities compared to general instructional flights while in our sample first-time solo student pilots did not feature any fatalities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this gives only the injuries and not the times the students got into accidents per se. Out of a total of 3811 accidents involving student pilots, 390 occurred while they were flying solo and around 50 involved first-time student solo pilots. Actually, student pilots themselves are prone to less accidents compared to others. From <a href=""http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&amp;context=jate"">Comparative Analysis of Accident and Non-Accident Pilots</a> by David C. Ison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most accidents (49.1%) were conducted with individuals holding a private pilot certificate. Second in incidence were commercial pilots (28.2%), followed by Airline Transport Pilots (ATPs) (13.7%), and student pilots (5.7%)</p>
  
  <p>Considering that 20% of pilots hold a student certificate, these individuals have a disproportionally low accident occurrence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report also gives some additional insight into the reason the first-time solo fliers have lesser injuries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... first-time solo pilots are commonly confined to the airport and practice their takeoff and landings. Such operations may result in accidents, but they will occur near to the ground with a lower risk of a fatality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report also gives some data about higher experienced student pilots sustaining more injuries, though nothing conclusive, noting that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... in 25 cases, student pilots were reported to have more than 100 and up to 322 h of flight experience. In the dataset, these pilots were significantly more often injured than students with less hours of flight experience.</p>

<p>It has to be noted that as the hours logged gets more, the students get into more demanding flights which may be reason for this increase in injuries.</p>

It seems it was more of a hard landing without gears. Why wouldn't the experimenters have made it more of a really hard crash if they needed to study the effects of a crash on a plane? Would slamming down the plane really hard (maybe even nose down) given a more realistic scenario and more valuable data rather than making it soft?</p>
","<p>If the plane crashes with high vertical speed, the decelerations involved are so insanely huge that there is absolutely no way to make it survivable. That is well explained in 
<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/16545/524"">Even after years of research, why are planes unable to keep passengers alive in case of a fiery crash?</a>.</p>

<p>However in many cases the aircraft is still, at least partially, controllable, so a crash-landing can be made. And that is the case where survivability can be improved by careful design, so that is the case they were testing.</p>

<p>This is also relevant for accidents on landing where the aircraft simply does not have that much vertical speed. Together these scenarios cover more accident cases than the out of control scenario.</p>

"Why is there a difference between GPS Speed and Indicator speed?","5698","","<p>I just played with flight simulator and noticed that the GPS shows different speed from the speed indicator in the cockpit. Also, GPS speed is higher than the Indicator. Any Idea why? </p>
","<p>The speed indicator in the cockpit shows <em>indicated airspeed</em>. Indicated airspeed is usually different than GPS speed, due to wind and aerodynamic effects.</p>

<p>GPS speed is your speed with respect to the ground. If you are standing on terra firma it reads 0. If it reads 100 knots you will be 100NM away from where you are now in one hour, so long as you keep flying in a straight line.</p>

<p>Airspeed is the speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding air. So if you are standing on terra firma with 20 knots wind blowing in your face, your airspeed will be 20 knots. If you travel at 100 knots airspeed against a 20 knots headwind wind, your ground speed is 80 knots. If you do 100 knots airspeed with 20 knots tailwind, your GPS speed reads 120 knots.</p>

<p>But even in calm wind conditions the airspeed indicator will read differently than the GPS speed . This has to do with the way airspeed is measured.  </p>

<p>Airspeed is measured with a pitot tube. A pitot tube has two pressure measurement ports. One that measures the total pressure $P_t$. This port is facing the incoming airflow. The other measures the static pressure $P$ and is placed perpendicular to the airflow. The difference between the two pressures is called impact pressure (pressure rise do to the airflow impacting the pitot tube) and is denoted $q_c$.</p>

<p>The impact pressure is related to the speed of the airflow the pitot tube is exposed to. If the flow is considered incompressible (which is an acceptable approximation for speeds up to 200 knots) the impact pressure can be derived from Bernouilli's equation.</p>

<p>$q_c = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2$</p>

<ul>
<li>$q_c$ is the impact pressure in Pa</li>
<li>$\rho$ is the density in kg/m<sup>3</sup>   </li>
<li>$V$ is the true airspeed in m/s</li>
</ul>

<p>The airspeed indicator is calibrated for standard sea level conditions, where $\rho$ is 1.225 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. In reality the aircraft will fly at altitude and therefor the actual density of the air is lower. Therefor the <em>indicated airspeed</em> will be lower as well. For example if an aircraft flies 75 m/s (about 146 knots) at 6000 ft the density will be 1.02393 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. </p>

<p>$q_c = \frac{1}{2} 1.02393 \cdot 75 ^2 = 2879.8 \textrm{ Pa}$</p>

<p>The equivalent airspeed at sea level for the same $q_c$ is:</p>

<p>$V_{EAS} = \sqrt{\frac{2 q_c}{\rho_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 2879.8}{1.225}} = 68.6 \textrm{ m/s}$</p>

<p>Your airspeed indicator will read only 68.6 m/s (133 knots) despite the fact that you are moving with 75 m/s (146 knots) with respect to the air.</p>

<p>Conversion of <em>true airspeed</em> to the <em>equivalent airspeed</em> can be done directly by:</p>

<p>$V_{EAS} =V\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}}$  </p>

<ul>
<li>$V_{EAS}$ equivalent airspeed (m/s)</li>
<li>$V$ true airspeed (m/s)</li>
<li>$\rho$ actual air density (kg/m<sup>3</sup>). </li>
<li>$\rho_0$ density at standard sea level conditions (1.225 kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The effects of the lower density on your aispeed indicator become more pronounced the higher you go. Once you go faster than about 100 m/s true airspeed the effects of compressibility can no longer be ignored and the above no longer applies. Airspeed indicators are corrected for effects of compressibility and therefore don't use the <em>equivalent airspeed</em> but instead use <em>calibrated airspeed</em> for calibration. </p>

<p>$V_{CAS}=a_{0}\sqrt{5\left[\left(\frac{q_c}{P_{0}}+1\right)^\frac{2}{7}-1\right]}$</p>

<ul>
<li>$V_{CAS}$ is calibrated airspeed</li>
<li>$a_{0}$ is the speed of sound under standard sea level conditions (340.3 m/s)</li>
<li>$P_0$ is the static air pressure under standard sea level conditions (101325 Pa)</li>
<li>${q_c}$ is the impact pressure</li>
</ul>

<p>The impact pressure is also a bit more complex for compressible flow:</p>

<p>$\;q_c = P\left[\left(1+0.2 M^2 \right)^\tfrac{7}{2}-1\right]$</p>

<ul>
<li>$P$ the static pressure</li>
<li>$M$ the Mach number</li>
</ul>

<p>Effectively, the higher and faster you get, the greater the difference between the indicated airspeed and the true airspeed.
For example, Mach 0.8 at 40000 ft in no wind will result in a GPS speed of <strong>489 knots</strong>, but a calibrated airspeed of only <strong>242 knots</strong>, which is less than half. </p>

<p>Therefore at high altitudes and speeds, the indicated airspeed will be lower than the ground speed / GPS speed, unless you have extreme headwind.</p>

"Can small children be seated away from their parents/guardians on a flight?","5697","","<p>I am interested if there is any law or regulation which prohibits carriers from seating children in a seat not adjacent to their parent/guardian?</p>

<p>I am flying with a group of 17, which includes 2 infants (without allocated seats), but seven children ranging in age from 2-5. We opted not to pay the extra charge to pre-allocate seats, and the airline has allocated us seats spread around the aircraft in a configuration which does not allow an accompanying adult to sit next to a child.</p>

<p>I was sure there was some air law which prohibited this on safety grounds, but have been unable to find it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Families, children and infants </p>
  
  <p>The seating of children close by their parents or guardians should be
  the aim of airline seat allocation procedures for family groups and
  large parties of children.</p>
  
  <p>Young children and infants who are accompanied by adults, should
  ideally be seated in the same seat row as the adult. Children and
  accompanying adults should not be separated by more than one aisle.
  Where this is not possible, children should be separated by no more
  than one seat row from accompanying adults. This is because the speed
  of an emergency evacuation may be affected by adults trying to reach
  their children.</p>
  
  <p>Whenever a number of infants and children are travelling together the
  airline should make every effort to ensure that they can be readily
  supervised by the responsible accompanying adults.</p>

<p>According to released information this cargo aircraft overran the runway after the crew aborted the take-off above V<sub>r</sub> after experiencing pitch control problems. The final report of this accident is not yet published but a preliminary report is available.  The investigation focusses on the payload distribution which may have caused imbalance leading to the perceived control problems.</p>

<p>The aircraft crashed on final approach in low visibility conditions (800 meters). During the initial approach the crew had requested and ILS approach (precision approach) to runway 02 but then changed their minds and asked for a VOR approach (non-precision approach) to runway 20. During the approach, after deactivation of the autopilot, the aircraft deviated 340 meters to the left and the crew subsequently announced they were going around. Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit tree tops and impacted residential buildings. </p>

<p>The final report is expected in October 2015. </p>

<p>To me it seems the probable cause is the failure of the flight crew to properly execute the published instrument approach including the published missed approach procedure which resulted in the aircraft impacting the trees and buildings. </p>

<p>The investigation into this accident is still running, only some preliminary information has been published. Preliminary data indicates that about 36 seconds after takeoff the engine no.2 auto-feathered, about 46 seconds subsequent to auto-feather the engine no.1 was shut off by the crew, resulting in loss of all thrust. The aircraft subsequently descended, stalled and crashed into a river. </p>

<p>ATR-42, 16 August 2015, Trigana Air Service Flight 257</p>

<p>This accident occurred just a couple of days ago so there are few facts known yet and no preliminary findings are published. I will not speculate about the probable cause of this accident. </p>

<hr>

<p>The common thread in the first four accidents seems to be the failure to comply with established procedures resulting in the loss of the aircraft. </p>

<p>In two cases (Lao Airlines Flight 301 and TransAsia Airways Flight 222) the flight crew flew a controllable aircraft into the ground. </p>

<p>In the case of the Air Niugini crash improper loading of the aircraft is likely to be the cause, resulting in the aircraft being not trimmed correctly for take-off. </p>

<p>The crash of TransAsia Airways Flight 235 is the only crash that involved an aircraft system malfunction (engine 2 failure). However, the ATR-72 can fly on a single engine so the failure itself should not have been fatal. The crew then shut down the other engine (number 1) which sealed the aircraft's fate. It is too early to conclude that the crew didn't follow the correct procedures here; for example there may have been ambiguous indications from the engine instruments that led them to believe that engine no. 1 had failed. However with the information currently available it seems that the crew did not follow the correct procedures for shutting down a failed engine. </p>

<p>The high number of crashes involving an ATR aircraft seems not to be related to the model itself, but to the safety culture and lack of training within a number of airlines operating the aircraft. </p>

Thinking about this further, I realize it could quickly devolve into a very broad <code>this aircraft uses a NACA standard wing</code>, <code>that one doesn't</code> list. That's not really my intent. A simple <code>yes, this aircraft/wing from 5-10 years ago uses a NACA standard</code> would answer the question completely, as would a <code>the last one I'm aware of is from 35+ years ago</code>.</p>

<p>Also, the use of ""modern"" is rather vague as the Boeing 757 certainly <em>feels</em> ""modern"" (having been launched in 1982) but has been out of production since 2004, while the 747 started production in 1969 and is still being built. If someone wants to jump in to help define ""modern"", I'd take no offense.</p>
","<p>Just three data points: The tail surfaces of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilatus_PC-12"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pilatus PC-12</a> still use the venerable NACA 0012, even though a better alternative (from the <a href=""http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=fx71120-il"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wortmann FX 71 L</a> series) was proposed. It did not help that the Wortmann airfoil is used on many small airplanes, has more lift <strong>and</strong> less drag and an abundance of data exists on it: The (mainly British) engineers at Pilatus were too conservative to use anything newer than an airfoil from the 1920s.</p>

<p>Generally, small companies or experimental airplane builders still rely sometimes on the NACA series, but in general better alternatives exist. Big companies use custom-made airfoils, helped by computer codes which model not only the two-dimensional flow around the isolated airfoil, but can optimize the specific wing section by including the influence of engine nacelles, pylons and the fuselage. Well-designed wing roots do not use one single airfoil, but a three-dimensional shape which minimizes interference drag.</p>

","<p>Not only does it affect air speed, but also angle of attack (AoA) and yaw.  The gun is well forward of the center of gravity (CG); so add to the recoil vectoring a build up gyroscopic torque as the gun spins up and down.  As air speed decreases, maneuvering approaches instability, thus placing a limit on the length of a safe burst determined by available energy (altitude, AoA and air speed.)  However, grouping accuracy and ammo conservation usually are more limiting than the effect of gun ""drag"".  Each A10's gun performance is distinctive.   Once a burst begins, the aircraft will pitch and yaw in its peculiar manner.  On the HUD you might find a wad of gum placed there by the pilot after his first aiming burst to show the direction of push.</p>

<p>The A10 employment scenario has always included battle field loiter to provide air cover, ensure extended engagement coordination, and provide tactical intel directly to the ground commander! Even low and slow, its hard to hit. Most infantry borne G-to-A missiles are IR guided. The A10's exhaust is hidden from below by the horizontal stabilizer; and the RAW/IRW system can automatically launch ""angel flares"" when the launch is detected, thereby negating any IR guidance system. Meanwhile you have just poked the bear and left your location for immediate response with an array of launch-and-leave air-to-ground guided weapons.    </p>

  <p>You don't need a panoramic view to land, ... Navigation is easy enough through side windows ... and you can just yaw the plane left and right for the times you do want to line up with something. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the differences between the CH-46 and the CH-47? </p></li>
<li><p>Why does the military run both instead of settling on one?</p></li>
</ul>
","<h3>The difference is in mission, and the difference is non trivial.</h3>

<p>The twin rotor configuration goes back to the 1960's. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piasecki_H-21"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Flying banana"" Piasecki H-21</a>.  The CH-47 replaced it in Viet Nam in 1965).  Chinook became the Army's heavy tactical lift during Vietnam.  Like the C-130, that particular design is timeless.  The CH-47F is the current configuration.  It carries about twice as much as a CH-46 could.  It is also one of the faster helicopters there is (it can fly almost 200kts) though the CH-53E has flown faster. </p>

<p>The CH-46 was an adaptation of the same idea, but made smaller and marinized: it had to meet a host of Marine Corps and Navy requirements to fit on amphibious ships and supply ships. Space and fit are non-trivial limitations when writing requirements for naval aircraft.  (As an aside, the US military no longer operates the CH-46.  It appears that the last CH-46 squadron in the USMC, <a href=""http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Major-Subordinate-Commands/4th-Marine-Aircraft-Wing/Marine-Aircraft-Group-49/Marine-Medium-Tiltrotor-Squadron-774/"" rel=""noreferrer"">HMM 774</a>, let go of its last Phrogs in 2015 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMM-774"" rel=""noreferrer"">and is now VMM 774, flying V-22's.</a>  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Vertol_CH-46_Sea_Knight"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Navy Sundown for CH-46 was in 2004.</a>)  </p>

<p>Not having to take off some power for a tail rotor is an advantage.  The CH-46 mission for the Marine Corps was vertical assault (it carried more than a Huey and predecessors like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_H-34"" rel=""noreferrer"">the CH-34</a>); for the Navy, it was the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_replenishment"" rel=""noreferrer"">VERTREP</a> mission. </p>

<p>The payload and maneuvering benefits from the lack of a tail rotor made the VERTREP mission a perfect fit for the CH-46.  One of the challenges in ship borne operations is the ability to run simultaneously resupply by air and ship-to-ship (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underway_replenishment"" rel=""noreferrer"">UNREP</a>) while not being operationally constrained (for the ship drivers) ""getting into the wind.""  That limitation tail rotor helicopters don't handle as well as the CH-46.  (That point was a core argument against CH-60S as replacement for  CH-46; but that's another matter).  I've flown VERTREP in helicopters with tail rotors; the CH-46 was less constrained than we were. </p>

<h3>What about Marine and Navy Heavy Lift missions?</h3>

<p>The Marine Heavy lift (analogue to the CH-47 for the Army and Air Force CSAR) is fulfilled with the CH-53, and has been for over 40 years.  The CH-53 can fold its tail to fit on a ship.  You can't fold a Chinook.  The Navy VOD (heavy lift) was handled by CH-53's for 40 years.  <a href=""http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.displayPlatform&amp;key=51A3587E-C772-4ADC-8197-4F4FE69216BB"" rel=""noreferrer"">They have since given that mission to the MH-53E minesweepers.</a>  (Flexible, that's helicopters!) </p>

<h3>Smart Requirement Writing led to smart choices</h3>

<p>""The Military"" would have made a significant mistake ""to just make one type"" since back in the 60s and 70s, making mission specific aircraft was the way to go.  Quite frankly, <em>it makes for cheaper aircraft to build it for one core mission.</em>  (See the A-10 as a fine example of that).  </p>

<p>Note: An early failure in ""one size fits all"" was the F-111.  A current ""one size fits all"" example of cost going through the roof is F-35.  </p>

<p>At the time the CH-46 and CH-47 were procured, the military was smart: apply the KISS principle to get aircraft that fit mission requirements.  The Army and Navy mission requirements were <strong>not</strong> identical.   </p>

<p>(So how do I know all that?  25 years Navy pilot (helicopters, ASW warfare specialty, did other stuff like Vertrep ...), significant experience in multi-service operations, and a few years having to work in an acquisition job.)  </p>

"Why is a large flashing ""X"" placed on a closed runway at Reagan National Airport?","5643","","<p>Runway 15 at DCA (Reagan National) is closed at night and other times. By ""closed,"" I mean that airport management places a gigantic lit/flashing ""X"" in the landing zone of 15. I'd estimate the big ""X"" is 8 by 8 feet, at least. It's like one of those roadside trailer flashing signs, except it's a runway.</p>

<p>The flashing X is very evident to pedestrians, bikers, etc., on the Mount Vernon trail. It's not some bizarre national secret.</p>

<p>My question: Why, in the tightly controlled airspace of Washington, DC, would DCA need to roll out a giant lit ""X"" to keep planes from landing there?</p>

<p>As if the obstruction were not there, you could fly in? That doesn't calculate, given how tight the airspace is controlled.</p>

<p>Why does this airport in the center of the world's highest airspace security roll out a construction trailer with a big X to keep planes from landing there?</p>
","<p>The standard way of marking a runway as ""CLOSED"" is to put a big giant <code>X</code> on it - for fields which operate at night that <code>X</code> needs to be lighted. The specifications for the runway closure marker are outlined in an <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22296"" rel=""noreferrer"">FAA advisory circular (AC 150/5345-55A)</a></p>

<p>The purpose of the marker is to indicate that the runway is temporarily closed (either administratively, as is the case at DCA, or for construction/repair/maintenance).  It is redundant with air traffic control measures (such as NOTAMs) indicating that the runway is out of service, in case some pilots didn't check NOTAMs or somehow managed to stumble into the airspace and happen upon the airport while it's closed.  (Obviously in the case of DCA they would have <em>other</em> problems were they to wander blindly into the area without talking to anyone, but believe it or not it happens far more often than any of us would like.)</p>

<hr>

<p>The big flashing <code>X</code> doesn't ""stop"" you from landing on the runway - it just tells you you really, <em>really</em> shouldn't be landing there. <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FOIA_inhofe_audio_recording_landing_closed_runway_new_information_204485-1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">There is a United States Senator who has achieved some notoriety in the aviation community after landing on a closed runway</a>.</p>

"On crosswind landings, is it preferable to side slip or crab on final approach?","5642","","<p>I've seen several instructional videos on crosswind landing techniques.  Some advise the pilot to crab the aircraft until just before touchdown when he/she should kick the rudder over to align the aircraft with the runway centerline.  Others advise the pilot to slip the aircraft all the way down so that no other cross control maneuver is needed.  Many of these videos also acknowledge the other way of doing things but say that their method is superior.</p>

<p>Is there an accepted ""safer"" method for flying a final approach with a crosswind or is it an entirely personal preference?</p>
","<p>Neither technique is ""preferable"" - the assumption that one is superior to the other is one of the most common <a href=""https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white"">false dichotomies</a> (and over-simplifications) in aviation. </p>

<p>With some notable exceptions (like the Ercoupe which is incapable of a slip and lands crabbed) a proper crosswind landing should involve elements of <em>both</em> techniques.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Crabbing</h1>

<p>Crabbing involves turning the nose into the wind so that some component of the aircraft's <em>thrust</em> is counteracting the crosswind, allowing the aircraft's ground track to align with the runway.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<p>Flying on final it is advantageous to crab into the wind: It is aerodynamically more favorable than a slip, and as the aircraft is kept coordinated it is more comfortable for passengers than a slip.<br>
Pilots often find a crab subjectively ""easier"" to maintain for extended periods of time compared to a slip: It does not require the pilot to maintain ""crossed controls"", and it's similar to how we maintain our course in other phases of flight (you were probably crabbing into the wind on downwind just a few seconds ago, and on instrument approaches flying the localizer in a crab is analogous to tracking a VOR on the enroute portion of your flight).</p>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

<p>On touchdown however landing in a crab will put a side-load on the landing gear (the aircraft is traveling along the runway centerline, but the gear is not aligned with that direction of travel). In extreme cases this can damage the tires, cause difficulty controlling the aircraft, and possibly even damage the landing gear assembly itself.<br>
""Kicking out the crab"" to align the landing gear with the runway requires an abrupt control movement at low altitude (generally not a good thing), and if done too early the crosswind will begin to blow the aircraft across the runway (leading to a landing that's not on the centerline, a side-load on the gear, and in the worst case an unintended departure from the runway surface.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Slipping</h1>

<p>Slipping involves banking the aircraft so that some portion of the wing's <em>lift</em> is counteracting the crosswind. Ordinarily the aircraft would tend to turn in the direction of the bank, so opposite rudder is applied to prevent the aircraft from turning and maintain the ground track parallel to the runway.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<p>Touching down on the runway a slip has the advantage of allowing you to align your landing gear with your direction of travel (down the runway) and avoid side-loading the gear. It also allows you to touch down on the upwind landing gear first which helps to stabilize the early roll-out, and positions your ailerons appropriately for taxiing with the crosswind.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

<p>Slipping down final however is likely to make your passengers uncomfortable - the plane is slanted in one direction, the rudder is pushing the nose around in the other direction, and folks start to feel like their butt is sliding out of the seat.<br>
Aside from passenger comfort a slip is a terribly inefficient aerodynamic arrangement (you're essentially trying to fly sideways), and not a ""normal"" way to fly in other phases of flight. You may have difficulty estimating the aircraft's performance and require power to maintain your glide path in this configuration. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Combining the techniques</h1>

<p>So a crab is advantageous on final (and flying an instrument approach), and a slip is advantageous on touchdown. It logically follows that the two techniques can be combined to provide the advantages of both:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crab down final (or on the localizer).</strong></li>
<li><strong>At some point transition into a slip.</strong><br>
Exactly where you make this transition is pilot preference, but the transition should be smooth, simultaneously bringing the nose around to align with the runway while banking into the wind to counteract the crosswind component.</li>
<li><strong>Touch down in the slip.</strong><br>
Complete your rollout with the appropriate crosswind aileron deflection, controlling your ground track with the rudder as needed to prevent weathervaning.</li>
</ul>

"If the landing gear is stuck in an airliner, can the crew go down and manually open it?","5638","","<p>There are several instances where we see the landing gear getting stuck before landing. In these kind of situations, can the crew, or one of the pilots, go down to the landing gear area and solve the issue?</p>
","<p>On older (WWII-era) large planes, the crew had access to a manual crank to lower the gear if the automatic extension/retraction system (usually a linear actuator powered electrically) failed. I don't know of any that had a gravity-based manual system; I'm sure a few bomber crews would have appreciated something like that after having to crank the handle to get a disabled main gear locked. Here are the manual crank ports for the B-17, on the forward bomb bay bulkhead with red arrows indicating the direction to crank:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WqjDY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The B-17 had a retractable tail gear as well, so there was a third manual crank in the tunnel to the rear gunner's position (but if there were multiple gear failures, the main gear would be the priority).</p>

<p>On more modern airliners with hydraulic extension/retraction, manually cranking the gear into place isn't as much of an option (especially since any access to a crank linkage would be in either the passenger cabin or the cargo hold). For these aircraft, the gear are designed with a ""manual extension"" or ""gravity release"". This basically disconnects the gear strut from its uplocks and the hydraulic cylinder, allowing gravity to pull the gear down and then momentum (or a spring mechanism) will engage the downlocks. Here is a diagram of the 737's manual gear panel on the right-hand wall of the flight deck:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oAgRb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The 747 has a manual nose gear extension system in the avionics compartment below the first-class cabin. The 747's main gear are much more complex, but it is still possible to let gravity pull them into place, by using a set of ""alternate gear extension"" switches on the overhead panel to release each gear from the hydraulics and uplocks:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBdPK.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It doesn't always work; a Virgin Atlantic 747 pilot was forced to make an emergency landing with the outboard right main gear stuck in a half-extended position:</p>

"Why do commercial flights turn / bank so sharply?","5621","","<p>When I take commercial flights, or you see turns in the vapour trails, they turn very sharply. What's the reason for this - wouldn't it be more efficient to turn gradually?</p>
","<p>Airplanes are expected by air traffic control to turn at a ""standard rate of turn"" which is 3 degrees per second.  This will provide a 90 degree turn in 30 seconds.  A standard rate is used so that controllers can anticipate how long it takes for an airplane to turn to a heading and they can line them up easier.  It also makes the turn happen in a smaller amount of airspace so that two airplanes can be flying in the same general vicinity without getting too close.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at the speeds that jet airplanes travel this would mean a very high angle of bank.  A standard rate turn at 200 KT TAS is about 30 degrees of bank and jets can go much faster than this, which would require even higher bank angles.  They actually limit it to 25 degrees of bank when using a flight director, mainly for passenger comfort.  </p>

<p>It can be impressive when looking out the window and seeing the ground, but don't worry, the airplane is more than designed for it!</p>

<p>This is used mainly at lower altitudes where there are lots of airplanes.  Once they are up high and airplanes are further apart (and the turns are also usually smaller) they  can bank even less (by using a ""half-bank"" mode) which adds to passenger comfort.</p>

<p>Is this design, a circular disc (or flying saucer) slightly humped on the top and bottom aerodynamically efficient? And if, we are able to use it for commercial purposes , would they give a better efficiency than existing aircraft?</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/go/7710/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> states that this would be a better design. Is this true?</p>
","<p>The correct answer is no. A ufo with its circular shape has trouble traveling through the air. It struggles to travel through the air like a city bus, which  gets 2-6mpg. Depending on the amount of thrust this object has depends whether it can lift up into the air. But it would not be efficient because of the amount of fuel it needs to consume to pass through the air, its kind of like a flying city bus not really very aerodynamic and is terrible in efficiency. If this was powered by human technology it would not be efficient considering if its made by humans, if it was made by aliens then maybe it would be efficient, but that information we do not know and probably never find out in our lifetime and we don't even know if aliens exist. You also have to consider the design of this certain ufo. This shape cannot develop lift and runs fully on thrust, which also decreases its efficiency because of gravity pushing down on the flying object. Imagine an airliner without wings and how much efficiency you loose without the wings.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/olRFf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/olRFf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>Wind tunnel test for a circular shape. If a ufo was so efficient it would have been used on our current airliners. Now lets go into problems with a ufo being an airliner.</p>

<ol>
<li>Its round circular shape would have trouble fitting into modern day terminals</li>
<li>Much thrust needed for vertical takeoff and landings</li>
<li>Not much room to store fuel</li>
<li>It would be very difficult for pilots to fly this object compared to modern day airliners</li>
<li>Airports would be redesigned for these objects which costs billions of dollars</li>
<li>Only has one engine to push the object instead of generally 2 on an airliner</li>
<li>Lots of weight the one engine needs to lift</li>
<li>One engine would be very difficult to do maintenance work on</li>
<li>The amount of money needed to be invested into this type of airliner </li>
<li>No horizontal or vertical stabilizer </li>
<li>Cost even more than the Concorde for maintenance</li>
<li>The costs to buy one of these would be 5x the price of a regular airliner</li>
<li>Amount of gas needed would be more than the Concorde</li>
<li>Amount of money needed to invest in this kind of technology, which doesn't even exist yet</li>
<li>No airline would want this because of the price</li>
<li>The whole ufo would generate lift, but that technology already exists and that's called a blended wing body, which is more of the focus towards future airliner and already has lots of money invested into it, and investing in a ufo would be too much money considering the amount invested blended wing body designs.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I hope those 16 reasons helped explain why it would not be more efficient  than a modern day airliner and why it can't go into service. So the article was false for efficiency and other reasons.</p>

"Are sun's UV rays more harmful on an airplane at high altitude?","5599","","<p>Most airplanes fly at >30k feet, way into the stratosphere / mesosphere where sun's UV rays aren't filtered by lower atmosphere layers. </p>

<p>If the windows of the plane are open and the sun is shinning right on a passenger, will the UV rays be more harmful than those on the earth's surface?
Are there any long term effects if a passenger is exposed frequently?</p>
","<p>Hmmm, opening the window at 30.000ft, where the air temperature is about -40°C/-40°F, air speed is extreme, you can't survive without oxygen, and you want to put your arm outside???</p>

<p>Well, if you really do, you'll get a sunburn quite fast. I got a sun burn within an hour in an altitude of 3500m / 12000ft, though I was tanned due to two weeks at the beach.</p>

<p>The ozone did already absorb a large fraction of the UV-C radiation, but as most of the air mass is already below you, the rest of the sun light will not have been filtered so much.</p>

<p>So, let's close the window.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, side windows and canopies are made of some kind of polycarbonate <s>like</s> or Plexiglass.</p>

<p>CERN measured the transmission of light through a 2mm sheet of plexigas and came to the result that no light below ~350nm, passes this sheet. Depending on source, the UV region starts below 380-400nm.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r9XWu.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r9XWu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>

<p>Keep in mind that the windows are usually thicker, which makes this step in the diagram much steeper.</p>

<p>So, there isn't much UV left which can cause a sun burn, but let's take the data from <a href=""http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/"" rel=""noreferrer"">rredc.nrel.gov</a> to calculate how much light you get and compare it to the light at ground. I found a function describing the data from CERN quite well, and applied it to the sun spectrum data (without atmosphere) twice, to get a Plexiglass window of 4mm thickness. So, this is the worst-case, with no air above the aircraft pre-filtering the sunlight.</p>

<p>Here is the result, which shows that sunlight is much more intense, and its color is heavily shifted to blue. But the intensity drops to zero, just where the UV-A range starts. Even, if you put the beginning of the UV-A range to 400nm, the intensity is still lower than at the ground.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ofSHs.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ofSHs.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Wind shields of larger aircraft are usually a quite thick composite material of glass and some plastics, which should absorb UV the same way as polycarbonate does, if not better.</p>

<p>So, I don't see any evidence that you get more UV light in an aircraft than on ground. </p>

<p>However, you should not underestimate cosmic radiation, which is absorbed by our atmosphere quite well on the ground, but not at high altitude. A transatlantic flight is equal to an X-ray photography of your chest. Flying staff is an occupation group exposed to much higher radiation doses than any other group and it's dose usually is supervised.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>As @PeterKämpf pointed out, Plexiglass is only one material used, and it is <em>not</em> a polycarbonate, which I didn't notice. But polycarbonates don't differ much concerning UV transmission, as the following diagram shows. However, I also read that polycarbonates - in contrast to plexiglass - are not UV hard and need an UV blocking coating when used outside.</p>

<p>If the tower had to relay weather, runway in use and other instructions to everyone pilot who joined the frequency it would take loads of their time; ATIS is instead there so controllers can spend their time controlling. When a pilot introduces his/herself on frequency at an airfield they announce the latest ATIS they have so that the controller knows they have up to date information and they don't need it relayed. </p>

<p>From a phraseology standpoint just saying ""with kilo"" is okay. I usually say ""with information kilo"" because it makes sure that kilo isn't confused as being part of my callsign. </p>

"Can the pitch be very different from the angle of attack?","5592","","<p>How much the pitch (horizontal orientation) can differ from the angle of attack?

","<p>The angle of attack is the angle between the wing (wing chord to be precise) and the direction of travel (undisturbed airflow). The angle of pitch is the angle between the main body axis and the horizon. The difference can theoretically be any angle, but during normal flight it will be limited to about 15 degrees.</p>

<p>The reason that the angle of attack sensor was inoperative was due to low airspeed. Below 60 knot IAS the indication is unreliable and therefore the indicator is inhibited. This also inhibits the stall warning. This lead to the confusing situation that lowering the nose to correct the stall increased the airspeed beyond 60 knots, thereby reactivating the stall warning.</p>

"Do we fly full size aircraft with video game style joysticks?","5590","","<p>Are there planes with electronic joysticks as shown below?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxqpO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxqpO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>RC airplanes are incredibly effective at using this technique. For actual planes it would remove the need for rudder pedals and a stick along with potentially being easier to get used to.</p>

<p>Are thumb controlled sticks used in aviation? or is there a reason to why they aren't used?</p>
","<p>As others already said, joysticks <em>are</em> used. But there is a fundamental difference with the RC controls.</p>

<p>We humans do much better job of dynamic control when controlling the <strong>force</strong> rather than position/displacement. It is too long a discussion why, but the main reason is that we have special force feedback sensors in our muscles. (Yes, it's a common misconception that we have only five senses).</p>

<p>For this reason, airplanes are generally controlled by force. Even those that have mechanical links and deflect the controls proportionally to <em>position</em>; even those FBW that measure position of the controls (the first type that Peter Kämpf mentioned) - they still, in the end, are controlled by human force. This is why correct loading (spring or otherwise) is crucial: certain displacement requires certain muscle force, and this force we apply and control.</p>

<p>Ideally, you want to tune the loading so that a certain force would produce a certain desired end effect. Say, each 1 kg pull produces additional 0.1g of normal acceleration. This naturally happens with classic reversible controls: when airspeed increases, the required control deflection (for a given acceleration) decreases significantly. But the required force per unit of deflection increases by the same amount. Thus we have constant force per acceleration, despite having very different control travel. This travel difference can be an order of magnitude, but it poses no problem for the pilot, because <em>force</em> is the same. In fact, pilots use it as a secondary feedback about airspeed.</p>

<p>Electronic (FBW, fly-by-wire) joysticks could be made to require no or little force, like RC controls, but this is never done. A great deal of effort is invested in producing optimal loading. For one, an accidental move of a light control might destroy the airplane. (This may happen even with RC airplanes, which are much stronger relatively). But even more importantly, it has been proven that gradual precise force control works better for us that position control.</p>

<p>This is why some aircraft (starting from F-16) moved away from positioning entirely and measure force on the stick directly. However, this just doesn't feel natural for us: we expect some movement in response to a force; so a small amount of movement is generally allowed even for pure force control.</p>

<p>The amount of travel also matters, but this is only a secondary feedback. Besides, it works better when we <em>see</em> the movement, which doesn't always happen when flying.</p>

<p>When you press brake in your car, you also feel and coordinate mainly the force on the pedal rather than its position. This allows you to adapt to different cars quickly. Racing cars have very little pedal travel. But if the required brake force was very light, you wouldn't be able to brake smoothly, no matter what travel there was.</p>

<p>Now the RC controls have almost insignificant spring, and are actually controlled by position. Normally, this doesn't give a precision anywhere near what a real airplane would require. As Daniel noted in his comment, you wouldn't be a happy passenger on such an airplane. This is partly mitigated by using a very close position reference (the hands grab the sides of the control) and using our most sensitive fingers, but still only partly.</p>

"What happens if you exceed the maximum speed on a C172?","5589","","<p>The airspeed indicator has a red marking that means: ""never exceed this speed"" ($V_{NE}$, around 160 KIAS). Why can't you exceed that speed?</p>
","<p>You can, but you have to live with the consequences. There are several things that can happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Depending on the vertical gusts ahead, you might not even get close to v$_{NE}$. There is another speed limit for gusty weather called <a href=""http://aviationglossary.com/v-speeds/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">v$_B$</a>, and exceeding this will run the risk of overstressing the wing structure. Going above v$_B$ will <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=76002d4ec8223589d1daab8b70759df6&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se14.1.23_1341&amp;rgn=div8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">overstress the wings in a gust</a> of more than 50 ft/s, and more than 25 ft/s when flying above v$_D$. The exact values can be found in the <a href=""http://faculty.dwc.edu/sadraey/V-n%20diagram.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flight envelope diagram</a> of the flight manual.</li>
<li>On a calm day, you can fly v$_{NE}$ and even a little faster, but once you fly fast enough, flutter will become very likely. Note that <a href=""https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-the-role-of-aeroelastic-flutter-in-the-events-of-9-11.t3359/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flutter needs some initial excitation</a>, so you might fly well into the flutter speed range before flutter occurs. When it does, control surfaces will be ripped from their fittings which will make the aircraft pitch up. At that point the wings will break off.</li>
<li>The engine on a C 172 is not powerful enough to sustain level flight at v$_{NE}$. You need to dive the aircraft, which requires some altitude. Maintaining the speed will mean that you dive into the ground, so you need to pull out of the dive in time.</li>
<li>On really fast aircraft the pitch trim will get more nose-heavy when the aircraft approaches the speed of sound. You don't run that risk in a C 172, but faster aircraft found themselves <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1413/how-does-exceeding-the-critical-mach-number-of-an-aircraft-affect-its-operation/1414#1414"">locked into a dive which they could not end</a>.</li>

"Can you bust a TFR while operating under IFR?","5582","","<p>Is it possible for the pilot to be held responsible for violating a Temporary Flight Restriction if the controller makes a mistake while you are operating under an Instrument flight plan (ie: does not deviate you around it, or allows you to go through it without clearing you with the responsible body)?</p>

<p>(Bonus: Can anyone find a more official reference for that story, and whether there was any legal followup from AOPA Legal or otherwise?)</p>
","<p>This is <a href=""http://www.aero-news.net/AnnTicker.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=841d7ba2-830d-4e12-854f-0078382bed3e"">a letter from AOPA that was published in Aero News Network</a>, based on a query made to the FAA on this very topic.</p>

<p>My interpretation of this is that there is no definitive answer, and that both the pilot and the controller have a responsibility, which may answer the question regarding why both parties were suspended in case described in the OP's post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello Mr. Ward,</p>
  
  <p>Your email was forwarded to us here in the Air Traffic department of
  AOPA. I contacted FAA headquarters for an official response to your
  question and received the following explanation:  Guess you could say
  it is the responsibility of both the pilot and air traffic controller:</p>
  
  <p>FAA Order 7110.65 states that ATC shall vector aircraft for separation
  and safety. This includes vectoring aircraft around TFRs as well as
  traffic. For the pilot, the applicable regulation is 14 CFR 91.103
  which pertains to preflight action and states that ""Each pilot in
  command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all
  available information concerning that flight,"" which includes TFRs.
  Additional regulations are covered in 14 CFR 91.13 and whichever CFR
  promulgated the TFR (e.g. 14 CFR 91.137; 14 CFR 91.138; 14 CFR 91.139;
  14 CFR 91.141; 14 CFR 91.143; 14 CFR 91.145)</p>
  
  <p>From a legal standpoint <strong>TFR avoidance is a joint responsibility</strong>. (This
  is in no way to be construed as a legal interpretation from FAA's
  legal staff). A pilot should not file an IFR flight through a TFR. If
  they did and that flight violated the TFR, they are subject to
  enforcement action.</p>
  
  <p>From an Air Traffic Quality Assurance standpoint, <strong>a controller should
  not allow an IFR or VFR flight that they are working to fly though a
  TFR.</strong> If they did, they would be subject to an Operational Deviation.
  However, looking at the totality of the circumstances: It is the
  pilot-in-command's (PIC's) duty to know exactly where the airspace is,
  just as it is ATC's responsibility to know where the airspace is. <strong>If
  ATC gave the pilot a vector that was going to take the aircraft right
  into the TFR and the pilot did not question the controller (just as if
  s/he would if being vectored into an area of known thunderstorms) then
  it is still the final responsibility of the pilot to question the
  clearance</strong>, just as it would be ATC's responsibility to question a
  pilot who wanted to fly directly through a TFR. Luckily, we are not
  aware of any instance where a controller let an IFR aircraft fly into
  a TFR. However, we are aware of many cases where pilots filed flights
  directly through TFRs and thought that ATC would vector them around,
  but instead, the pilot departed VFR expecting to pick up an IFR
  clearance in the air. While waiting for ATC to respond and issue a
  clearance the pilot flew through the TFR. In those cases, FAA
  suspended pilot certificates from 30 to 150 days.</p>
  
  <p>There is no question that it is bad operating practice to file an IFR
  flight through a TFR. During flight planning, pilots should avoid
  TFRs. Arguably, to deliberately file a flight plan through a known
  TFR, in and of itself, would be a violation of 14 CFR 91.103.</p>
  
  <p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I'm looking to go into commercial aviation (I'm currently a CFI working on hours) and am specifically wondering about how having it in my record will affect interviewing for regionals.</p>
","<p>Depends on the reasons the FAA had to justify the need for a 709 ride.  If it was some kind of bureaucratic maneuver without justification for doing so and you pass the ride with flying colors, probably nothing.  If there was a serious discrepancy in your airmanship which required a 709 ride to verify improvement on your part, it's going to depend on whether it was a one time event or a trend in airmanship deficiency resulting in the check ride.  In addition have there been further reports of deficiency in your airmanship after the 709 ride?  That will also have an effect on an employer's judgment of you as a potential employee.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons for the 709 ride, an employer is going to see it, so be prepared to explain anything associated with it.  </p>

<p>Look at this from the employer's perspective:  I'm going to put you in charge of a big, heavy multimillion dollar machine that you are going to pilot several miles off the ground at speeds close to that of sound.  If anything goes wrong, you're going to get killed, someone else on board is going to get killed, people on the ground are going to get killed and I'm going to get sued, go bankrupt, end up in jail, or all three if your negligence can be traced back to me.  Is there anything in your background which make me suspicious this is likely to happen if you are in my employ as a pilot?</p>

<p>The fact that you do make mistakes, possibly even serious ones, is not necessarily the issue here; everybody makes mistakes.  The last time you flew on an airliner the flight crew probably screwed something up.  People with thousands of PIC hours learn something new on their next flight and it's a mark of a good pilot that you can identify your own faults <strong><em>and fix them</em></strong>.  The Blue Angels have a private saying amongst themselves that ""We've never flown a perfect airshow and we probably never will.  But we strive for the perfect airshow each and every flight"".  Striving for perfection as a personal motivator is the mark of a good airman and looks good on a resume, no matter how balls up some flight in your logbook was.</p>

<p>The real issue here is do you have a recent or chronic history of uncorrected gross negligence or inability to handle the kinds of aircraft a potential employer flies which raises red flags as to your airmanship or trustworthiness.  If you have a spotty record or recent 709 ride in your recent past, take a couple of years staying on with your current employer and do an outstanding job.  Work on your airmanship and develop a stellar reputation with them as a pilot.  That will go a long way to erasing the past, or at least mute its bite.</p>

<p>Speaking of trustworthiness, <strong><em>DO NOT LIE TO A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER ABOUT A 709 RIDE OR ANY OTHER FAILED CHECKRIDE</em></strong>.  Aviation is built upon an honor system and any kind of detected lying or deceitfulness on your part is an automatic fail with no second chances, no matter how squeaky clean your career is up to that point.  If they ask about it, tell it like it was, no more, no less, and let the chips fall where they may.  It will yield the best possible outcomes, even if you don't get the job.</p>

"How should I deal with a passenger experiencing hypoxia over the Grand Canyon?","5572","","<p>I am taking my mom for a trip over the grand canyon. My mom lives at sea level, whereas I live at 5000ft, and workout at 8000ft daily.</p>

<p>The VFR lowest route over the Grand Canyon is 11,500ft MSL. If I am flying over this with my mother and she starts to exhibit signs of hypoxia, what are my options?</p>

<p>It is the law to remain at the prescribed altitudes and headings while flying around the Grand Canyon. That being said, obviously passenger safety comes before anything else. If my mom gets sick, I would have to drop in altitude, but what kind of consequences would I face for this?</p>

<p>In the event of hypoxia in one of these corridors, what would be the best way to deviate while remaining safe and courteous?</p>
","<p>First, let's be crystal clear on something: A person experiencing symptoms of acute hypoxia <strong><em>is an emergency</em></strong> which requires immediate action to ensure the safety of that person. <em>In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule …  to the extent required to meet that emergency.</em> (<a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10.1.4.2"">FAR 91.3 (b)</a>).</p>

<p>So if you're over the Grand Canyon at 11,500 feet and your mother starts showing signs of hypoxia you key the mic and let ATC know you have a passenger showing signs of hypoxia, tell them you are descending to a lower altitude, and ask for vectors to an airport where you can land. If they give you any trouble about it you respond with ""N12345 <em>is declaring a medical emergency</em>"".</p>

<hr>

<p>All that said, there are sensible things you can do to mitigate the risk of hypoxia and avoid the need to declare an emergency.<br>
If you intend to spend an extended period of time at altitude (which I personally define as ""Over 10,000 feet"" for an average healthy non-smoker):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bring a <a href=""http://www.skyox.com"">portable oxygen system</a></strong><br>
Ideally with enough cannulas/outlets for yourself and your mother/other passengers).</li>
<li><strong>If a full oxygen system isn't an option bring one or more <a href=""http://www.mypilotstore.com/MyPilotStore/sep/8543"">""boost cans""</a></strong><br>
These can provide temporary/limited relief for symptoms of hypoxia – probably enough to get yourself back on the ground, or at least to a lower altitude.</li>
<li><strong>Carry a relatively inexpensive <a href=""http://www.mypilotstore.com/MyPilotStore/sep/6301"">pulse oximeter</a></strong><br>

","<ol>
<li><p>""Tire Alarm"" would be that the tires do not have enough pressure in them. You deal with that one by coming in at a lower speed. Once you land, you would have to compensate for whatever direction the airplane lurches in.</p></li>
<li><p>For the airspeed and altimeter alarms, just use your memory of about how a certain altitude and speed looks like. For airspeed, the engine sound might also help.</p></li>
<li><p>For any of the braking alarms (brake, air brake, thrust reverse) just go in a little slower and lower and prepare for a longer landing roll.</p></li>

<li><p>ASY and No Fuel (for certain engines) alarms would best be counteracted by just using more throttle than you normally would since a number of engines would not be working.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Tire, airspeed, altimeter, braking, and flaps alarms can't be ""fixed"" from your controls. The ASY and No Fuel may be able to be fixed by transferring fuel over to the empty tank. However, in certain alarms, the fuel just leaves immediately, so forgo trying to transfer fuel over. You also want to keep your attention of your flying or you might smash into the ground while trying to take care of your alarms.</p>

"Can civilian aircraft fly through or land in restricted airspace in an emergency?","5549","","<p>This is a super hypothetical question of mine. I was wondering if civilian pilots who happened to be faced with a severe emergency could fly through or possibly request to land in restricted airspace? Mainly I am referring to Area 51?</p>
","<p>FAR 91.3 states that any pilot in command may deviate from any regulation or rules to the extent needed to deal with the emergency.  That includes entering restricted or prohibited airspace.</p>

<p>In the example that you suggested, yes you could do so and land at the Groom Lake flight test facility at KXTA, provided you could reach their controllers or contact Nellis Approach Control declaring an emergency.  I will say that if you do enter R-4808 N and land there, don't expect them to roll out the welcome mat.  You will be immediately met by USAF Military Police who will arrest you, most likely at gunpoint, and spend several hours, if not days, there or outside the compound being extensively questioned by Air Force Security personnel, the FBI and Homeland Security.  Your aircraft will be impounded and inspected, possible indefinitely, and search warrants issued for your property.  If they find out that you faked an emergency to enter that compound, you are in very serious trouble and face a variety of federal charges including trespass upon a classified installation and whatever else the DoJ can throw at you.</p>

<p>In addition, you would need a very, very good reason to even be anywhere near Area 51, as it is in the middle of a military reservation geographically the size of the nation of Switzerland in the middle of south central Nevada.  There are no published routes over the airspace and all commercial and civilian traffic is kept far, far away.  Details about the airfield are not published on government aeronautical charts or regional A/FDs.  See the VFR sectionals and enroute charts below.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA029262"" rel=""noreferrer"">1970s military research paper on radar</a> supporting the need for secondary transponders in detecting light aircraft also mentions detecting doppler from propellers (p.4) in addition to the primary radar reflection, and I would expect the cross section of a lawn chair to perhaps be within an order of magnitude of that of a propeller.   A 2m x 0.5m x 0.5m sparsely filled aluminum chair frame is also still larger than typical microwave radar wavelengths (1Ghz = 30cm wavelength, most radars are going to be above 1Ghz), so it should reflect the radar but of course is a fairly small object compared to large aircraft and therefore the detection range could be lower.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Would a homemade lawn chair balloon be visible on ATC and collision avoidance radar?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>might</em> be visible to ATC, but, at best, only as one of several inconspicuous unidentified red dots.</p>

<p>It wouldn't appear on aircraft collision avoidance displays (TCAS) and would not trigger any TCAS alerts.</p>

<h2>Radar cross section</h2>

<p>Balloons, and clusters of balloons are mostly air (or similarly insubstantial gas). There is a thin layer of plastic but many plastic materials (e.g. mylar) are transparent to radar, or only weakly reflective.  </p>

<p>It is for this reason that aerostats and <a href=""https://www.balloonchallenge.org/tutorials"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high altitude balloons</a> carry <a href=""http://sentintospace.com/products-page/flight-components/radar-reflector/#ad-image-0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radar-reflectors</a> when they need to be detected by radar.</p>

<p>Whether the chair itself has a detectable radar cross section depends partly on what materials it is constructed from. I suspect most available lawn chairs are not constructed from solid sheets of metal fixed at right angles but, at best, from a relatively tiny amount of relatively small-gauge metal tubing.</p>

<p>I'd be surprised if any improvised lawn-chair balloon had the same radar cross-section as a glider - and those are allegedly <a href=""http://www.dg-flugzeugbau.de/radar-reflector-e.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hard to see</a> on primary radar.</p>

<p>Some helium balloons are made from metallised mylar (because it keeps the helium in for longer). These may be much more reflective to radar. The Calgary aviator pictured was said to have used ""oversized party balloons"" - they don't look like the metallised balloons that are commonplace where I live.</p>

<p>A perfectly conducting metal sphere of 1.15m diameter has a radar cross section of 1 m²</p>

<p>Some other radar <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_cross-section#Measurement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cross section values</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human: 1 m²<br>
  small combat aircraft: 2–3 m²<br>
  Cargo aircraft: up to 100 m²  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that military radar might display a return to an operator. A civilian primary radar might be less likely to display a return to an operator.</p>

<h2>Primary radar</h2>

<p>So far as I can tell, most civilian ATC and powered aircraft (TCAS etc) don't really make much use of primary radar to detect other airborne vehicles. They rely on transponder returns (i.e. secondary radar)</p>

<p>Even a large metal object like a Boeing 777 can disappear from the view of ATC and other aircraft when it turns off its transponder.</p>

<p>The Guardian newspaper <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/29/russian-bombers-english-channel-ambassador-summoned"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reported</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last month, the Swedish government complained that a Russian military aircraft had been flying near its airspace with its transponders turned off to avoid being spotted by civilian radar, and nearly collided with a passenger jet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd be surprised if an improvised lawn-chair balloon was detectable where a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tu-95</a> was not.</p>

<h2>What ATC see</h2>

<p>This is from what is said to be a radar <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0GI-1gja5Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recording of flight 77</a> (at 4:18) probably at Dulles after controllers were aware of the prior 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eEbuf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Flight 77 had turned off its transponder, it is one of the small red dots at the left. Here's a closer look at that</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pKyH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Flight 77 is the red dot about 20% in and up from bottom left. There are other red dots that come and go but this one tracks steadily from left to right. I'd guess an especially alert controller who is not very busy would notice this sort of dot.  Even if the radar display doesn't filter it out,  unannounced slow-moving lawn-chair balloons appearing from the suburbs might not always be noticed (though see James' comment to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/16730/1289"">Peter's answer</a> which suggests they often do notice and act on such targets). </p>

<h2>Transponders</h2>

<p>Radios and transponders designed for hot-air balloons are available (<a href=""http://www.lambert-aircraft.com/eng/avionics-special.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>) and I've <a href=""http://www.4-flight.co.uk/transponder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">read</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transponders are mandatory for flights in some types of airspace in many parts of Europe from March 2008 onwards. This includes balloons and other light / recreational aviation and aircraft. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I suspect that authorities will expect aviators in lighter-than air vehicles will take appropriate measures to be in communication with ATC/other aircraft and perhaps to be visible to secondary radar in airspace where they may come into conflict with other aircraft.</p>

<h2>Kevin Walsh</h2>

<p>Heres a news report from <a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19840719&amp;id=fGscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4U4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7001,3617123&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Milwaukee Sentinel - Jul 19, 1984</a></p>

<p>So you probably need to take specific measures to make yourself more likely to show up on primary radar. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When attaching balloons to your lawn chair, first scrutinize the intertubes for designs for large improvised radar reflectors you can dangle from your vehicle. Hope that nearby on-duty ATC controllers have their displays set to show primary radar returns and not just secondary radar returns.</p>

After that, it is compressed and cooled again by an expansion turbine. When finally air is condensed, it mixes with bypass bleed air. What is bypass bleed air? </p>
","<p>You almost have the answer in your question; bleed air is hot, compressed air taken from the engine compressors.  Bypass bleed air here refers to some of that air which is bled off the engine, but not routed through the air cycle machine (pack).  When the air comes out of the pack, its really cold.  The pilot has a knob which blends the cold air from the pack with the hot bypass air to adjust the temperature that comes through the actual ductwork; this is similar to the blender box in a car.</p>

"Is constant air pressure maintained inside the fuselage?","5500","","<p>I just heard it somewhere but I'm not sure about it.   If it is, then why don't they build airtight fuselages?</p>
","<p>For the purposes of air pressure inside aircraft, they are broken down into two broad categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unpressurized - These aircraft are typically piston powered and can't go very high, so do not even attempt to regulate the air pressure inside the fuselage.</li>
<li>Pressurized - These aircraft do maintain pressurization in the fuselage, but it isn't constant beyond a certain point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The category determines the answer to your question:</p>

<h1>Unpressurized Aircraft</h1>

<p>Unpressurized aircraft are not built air-tight for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is very hard to make something as large as an airplane truly air-tight, and keep it that way.  Over time, seals will start to leak, fittings will loosen, etc.</li>
<li>The fuselage would have to be much stronger to withstand the pressure difference between the inside and the outside.  This would make them heavier and more expensive.</li>
<li>There isn't much need.  These airplanes don't fly high enough to really require a pressurized fuselage and a person can breathe more or less normally even though you aren't at sea level.  (Think of people that live on mountains.)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pressurized Aircraft</h1>

<p>Without going into the details of <strong>how</strong> an aircraft is pressurized (which isn't really relevant to your question), the air pressure inside the fuselage of a pressurized aircraft is usually maintained at sea level pressure up to a certain point.  However, the fuselage is designed to withstand a particular maximum differential air pressure, so in order to protect it (basically keep it from ""popping"" when the air pressure outside the airplane drops too low), the pressure is allowed to decrease when needed. </p>

<p>In typical jet airplanes, the pressure inside portions of the airplane (typically the passenger compartment, some of the cargo holds, and maybe an avionics bay) at cruising altitude is maintained at a pressure which corresponds to an outside air pressure at an altitude of about 5,000 - 8,000 feet (referred to as ""<a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Cabin_Altitude"" rel=""nofollow"">cab</a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization#Cabin_altitude"" rel=""nofollow"">in</a> <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/cabinair/environmentfacts.page"" rel=""nofollow"">alt</a><a href=""http://www.who.int/ith/mode_of_travel/cab/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">itude</a>""), depending on the cruising altitude and the design of the airplane.</p>

"How does my Casio watch know the altitude in flight?","5499","","<p>Wrist watches usually use the barometric pressure sensors they have to calculate the altitude. I have also confirmed this from the manual of my watch, which states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The watch displays altitude values based on air pressure readings taken by a built-in pressure sensor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fine that's understood and makes sense and has always worked for me wherever I go. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>But then how does it know altitude during flight? The cabin of all commercial airliners are pressurized and hence the air pressure is not changing inside the cabin with the change in altitude (as happens for descent or ascent on ground). I know that even the aircraft itself uses pressure sensors for many calculations but those sensors are mostly usually on the Pitot tube and they sense the real outside pressure and not inside an pressurized cabin</p>

<p>I would also like to mention that yes the altitude reading it takes during a flight is not always close to what the real value is but still it does track the altitude difference when pressure inside the cabin remains same, how so?</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong></p>

<p>That I didn't include the exact details of my watch because neither am I promoting any special model or a brand nor am I asking specifics of how a watch works, focus is on air pressure inside the cabin, not on watch. If needed I can provide the model and manual reference links. </p>
","<p>The pressure in the cabin does not remain the same. It decreases, but much more slowly, in such a manner that when the aircraft is at 37000 feet the pressure in the cockpit is the equivalent of 7000 or 8000 feet. Keeping the cabin pressure at sea level would pose incredible stress on the fuselage, due to huge difference in pressure between the inside and the outside.</p>

"How do airlines ensure each passenger has a life jacket before a flight?","5498","","<p>It's very easy for a passenger to walk away with a life jacket. What do airlines do in general to ensure that there is a life jacket available for each passenger? Do they check it manually as part of pre-flight check up?</p>
","<p>It's essentially a manual check for many airlines, performed as part of the pre-flight checks.</p>

<p>However, the airline I have worked for recently upgraded from manual checks to RFID tags on each lifejacket (a sticky tag kind of <a href=""http://www.harlandsimon.co.uk/Images/RFID/RFID-Passive-Tag.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">like this</a>). The RFID tags can be read from the aisle by a handheld reader. So the person who does the checks simply walks down the aisle with the reader and is able to tell if a seat is missing a jacket and also if the jacket needs to be replaced due to the expiry date fast approaching.</p>

<p>In addition to a tag on the actual life jacket there are also security RFID tags across the life jacket holster under the seat. So the scanner is able to tell if the life jacket has been tampered with as the security tag would have been broken.</p>

<p>As for the frequency of checks, different regions have different requirements. Usually life jackets are only needed at all if flying over a large body of water. I believe the USA requires a check before any flight which passes over the USA (as well as water). Europe requires less frequent checks.</p>

"Why do most military aircraft use different engines than commercial aircraft?","5485","","<p>Why do most military aircraft and helicopters use different engine technology (fighters, B52, U2, etc) than most commercial aircraft?
[I removed the use of axial terminology]</p>
","<p>Two reasons: age and speed.</p>

<p>High bypass turbofans have only been in existence since the 70s - the B-52 was one of the first mass-produced jet powered military aircraft, and turbofans were simply not around at the time. Same for the U-2.</p>

<p>Many fighter aircraft go supersonic, and jet engine thrust T is defined as $T = \dot{m} \cdot (V_e - V_0)$, with $V_0$ the airspeed. Exhaust velocity $V_e$ must be higher than true airspeed in order to generate thrust, and turbojets have a much higher exhaust flux velocity than the cold stream of the turbofan.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4SG8g.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4SG8g.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://history.nasa.gov/SP-468/ch10-3.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Image source</a></p>

<p>Pure turbojets are noisy and thirsty, and modern fighters use low bypass jet engines with mixed exhaust streams, like the one depicted above. This configuration still allows for the use of afterburners: take-off thrust is where high bypass turbofans are particularly strong.</p>
","46679"
"Why don't modern aircraft have landing gear that can swivel to compensate for crosswinds?","5471","","<p>When landing, crosswinds can be very expensive. They cause go-arounds, diversions to other airfields and even crashes.</p>

<p>Currently pilots crab in the air to counteract crosswinds and, at the last moment, throw the aircraft around to face directly along the runway. This is a challenging and risky manoeuvre - it can cause asymmetrical stalls and worse.</p>

<p>The nose wheel can already be rotated. If the main gear could also rotate, the plane could land in a crabbed attitude and continue that way along the runway until speed had dropped to taxiing speed.</p>

<p>How come aircraft don't have this feature?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It has been flagged that this question is similar to a previous one, <em>Is the main landing gear of a large airplane designed for sideways (crabbed) touchdowns?</em></p>

<p>My question is different. In those cases the landing gear does not actively turn to face in the direction of travel relative to the ground, it is merely designed to cope with the extra stress of hitting the runway obliquely. The allowed angle may be quite small. A swivelling undercarriage would allow for a large angle of crab with no attendant stress to the gear because the wheels would be aligned with the runway.</p>

<p>As pointed out on that other question, this design feature <strong>was</strong> adopted for the B-52. I am asking what factors persuaded designers to abandon this idea.</p>

","<p>There is one aircraft I know of that can do exactly what you state, the B-52:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NykHM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This plane has steerable dual-bicycle gear which allows the crew to point the gear along the runway while the fuselage is ""crabbed"" up to 20* off the runway centerline. AFAIK the gear are slaved to the ILS; you dial in the OBI to a course and the gear will point that way even if the aircraft points differently.</p>

<p>The reason this was done is primarily due to the design of the rest of the aircraft. It's a very ""dense"" design, cramming a lot of weight into a very small package, requiring massive wings and tail just to keep the thing under control at altitude. These surfaces then become huge sails at lower altitudes, and with the high, anhedraled wing arrangement on a relatively low fueselage, there's not much room for error. B-52 pilots often say you have to fly 2 seconds ahead of the plane, it's that slow to react to pilot input. So, classic ""de-crabbing"" techniques involving a hard rudder with counter-aileron just aren't going to work with a BUFF. You have to land crabbed and correct after touchdown, and on a dry runway that isn't a good idea either with an aircraft of this size.</p>

<p>Modern airliners, for their size, are much easier to maneuver on the whole than the BUFF. Really big ones, like the 747, actually have steerable main gear as well, but AFAIK the 747's mains can only be actively steered on the ground, and because they counter-steer to the nose gear (helps bring the tail around corners; imagine driving something about 4 times longer than an 18-wheeler) they would actually be pointed further off the runway line when de-crabbing.</p>

<p>Four- and six-wheel main gear systems used on larger airliners (777, 787, A380) actually have a small amount of castering built in; if you watch YouTubes of crosswind landings (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la-hSjKP2TU"" rel=""noreferrer"">there</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMvLuUJFHYk"" rel=""noreferrer"">are</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjWjRJGnY34"" rel=""noreferrer"">several</a>) you'll see that the rear two wheels of each gear touch first and actually twist the entire ""truck"" into line with the aircraft's actual direction of travel. Then as the plane settles on the gear and the fuselage lines back up with the runway, they'll straighten. Planes with one- and two-wheel main gear don't need this as much (and such a system isn't as effective as the first point of contact of a tire is directly level with the gear strut instead of behind it).</p>

"Why don't planes use pulsejets?","5458","","<p>According to my research, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsejet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pulsejet's</a> thrust grows as the airspeed increases. Most pulsejets require no moving parts which makes it easier to manufacture them. They are also very lightweight which can have some great effects on aircraft.</p>

<p>They are very slow at zero airspeed but very fast at high airspeeds. Therefore you could simply have a normal jet engine to power the take off and then switch after take off to the pulsejets.</p>

<p>Here is an example where I've labelled a DC-10 of what a pulsejet with jet engine plane could look like:</p>

<p>So why don't planes use pulsejets? Surely they would allow planes to go faster and in turn allow them to reach destinations quicker. Also the pulsejets are easier and cheaper to produce than jet engines and there lighter than jet engines.</p>

","<p><strong>Day and Night for Pilots</strong></p>

<p>As pilots we often talk about night flying and daytime flying meaning when it is dark or light, but for logging time and for currency there are specific definitions that we must pay attention to.</p>

<p><strong>FAR 1.1 General Definitions</strong></p>

<p>Night means the time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published by the American Air Almanac, converted to local time.</p>

<p>Day is not defined in the FARs but the definition of night implies that it is the time between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight.</p>

<p>The Air Almanac is published annually on CD-ROM but you can find sunset, sunrise, and civil twilight times for specific locations at the US Naval Observatory website.</p>

<p>The time between sunrise/sunset and twilight is 26-30 minutes depending on the time of year. Since you can easily find sunrise/sunset information in newspapers, the weather channel, etc. you can estimate twilight fairly easily.</p>

<p><strong>Currency</strong>
§61.57 (b) (1) … no person may act as pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers during the period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise, unless within the preceding 90 days that person has made at least three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop during the period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise, and…</p>

<p><strong>VFR Weather Minimums</strong>
Only Class G airspace has different minimums depending on night and day and they use the standard night definition—end of evening twilight to the beginning of morning twilight.</p>

<p><strong>Aircraft Lights</strong>
Aircraft lighting is required between sunset and sunrise. 
§91.209 During the period between sunset and sunrise no person may 1. operate an aircraft unless it has lighted position lights, 2. park or move an aircraft in an area of an airport where night operations are being conducted unless it is clearly illuminated, has position lights, or is in an area marked by obstruction lights.</p>

<p><strong>Aeronautical Experience Requirement</strong>
In order to obtain a private pilot certificate night training is required. The commercial pilot certificate requires solo night flights. In these cases the standard night definition—end of evening twilight to the beginning of morning twilight—applies.</p>

<p><strong>Special VFR</strong>
AIM 4-4-6 g. Special VFR operations are prohibited between sunset and sunrise unless the pilot is instrument rated and the aircraft equipped for IFR flight.</p>

<p><strong>Logging Night Flying Time</strong>
Logging of night flight should be made in accordance with Part 1 definitions, which is from the end of evening civil twilight to the start of morning civil twilight. This differs from the definition used for night currency.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Position lights – sunset to sunrise</p>

<p>Special VFR – sunrise to sunset unless instrument rated</p>

<p>Carry Passengers – 1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before</p>

<p>Take the case of an F-22.  Assuming a 55,000 lbf takeoff weight, lineup, 70,000lbf thrust at full power, then brakes off and rolling, we expect to see an acceleration around:</p>

<p>This also assumes no friction from the wheels or air resistance during the takeoff roll.</p>

<p>By basic kinematics, the jet would reach 60mph or 88ft/sec in 88/41 = 2.15 seconds.</p>

<p>So could an F-22 or another high performance jet fighter beat an Model S in a drag race?  Well it's theoretically possible and and as the above example shows, it has happened and it didn't end well for the auto.</p>

<p>As for airliners, the car is going to smoke them until the car reaches Vr for the jet or thereabouts.</p>

<p>And there is no way in hell a Model S is going to do 0-1000 mph.</p>

"Why is it rare for small aircraft to have winglets?","5451","","<p>I've noticed that winglets are very rare on small aircraft. I wonder why this is the case. Wouldn't they have the same advantages, especially because they travel at low speed? Or is it just a wrong impression I got and they aren't that rare?</p>
","<p>I've talked to a couple of aerodynamicists, and for small aircraft when you run the numbers the improvement offered by winglets is often less than the drag penalty caused by their weight (which also reduces allowable payload). For larger aircraft that fly long distances, the proportion of the aircraft's weight that is due to the winglets is much smaller than it is for small aircraft, so they don't have this problem and that makes winglets a viable strategy.</p>

<p>P.S: I know they are parked and are not taking positions to take-off.</p>
","<p>Most of your questions seem to be answered by the current answers/comments, but since you are wanting more detail...</p>

<p><em>1) Did the plane, highlighted with a yellow circle, need to reverse to line up so neatly even though it just turned (I assume). Is the turning radius really that small that it takes very little space for a big plane to change direction so quickly on ground?</em></p>

<p>Yes, either the plane in the yellow circle or the one directly behind it had to be reversed into its spot. When airplanes are being repositioned around an airport, they are typically towed, because it requires less fuel and it's easier to start up a tug and hook it up than to power up a large jet for taxi. The tug is also able to push the jet backwards when needed (which also happens routinely when the jet departs from an airport gate).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/KPAE#rwys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Runway 11/29</a> at <a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/KPAE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KPAE</a> (currently closed except for taxiing for obvious reasons) has a width of <strong>75ft (23m)</strong>. <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/acaps/787.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to Boeing</a>, a 787-8 (the indicated plane and all but the green 747 at the northwest end) needs <strong>128ft (38.9m)</strong> width to make a turn. This assumes a steering angle of 70 degrees, with the R2 outer gear at one edge at the beginning of the turn at a radius of 46ft and R3 nose gear at the opposite edge halfway through turn at a radius of 82ft. So it would not be possible for a 787 to turn around on that runway. Certainly not a 747. Even if they tried to do something like a three point turn, the distance between the nose and main gear is 74ft 9in center to center, which puts the wheel distance just over the runway width.</p>

<p><em>2) Is there any special reason that all the planes are on one side of the runway and not centered on the markers? They all seem to be lined up towards the left side of the picture.</em></p>

<p>They are probably on the south side to provide as much clearance as possible for taxiway D immediately to the north (as Lnafziger commented). The taxiway to the south is <a href=""http://aeronav.faa.gov/content/aeronav/online/pdf_files/legendAD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">marked as closed</a> (might be W?). The <a href=""http://www.airnav.com/airport/KPAE#notes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Additional Remarks on AirNav</a> include (<em>with my comments</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>...TAXIWAY D BETWEEN D2 AND ALPHA (<em>north section of D</em>) RESTRICTED TO WINGSPAN OF 118' OR LESS. TAXIWAY D BETWEEN D2 AND GOLF (<em>south section of D</em>) RESTRICTED TO WINGSPAN OF 49' OR LESS.</li>
  <li>TAXIWAY W CLOSED INDEFINITELY (<em>probably south of runway 11/29</em>).</li>
  <li>TAXIWAY INTERSECTIONS D2, D3, AND D4 CLOSED INDEFINITELY (<em>between runway 11/29 and taxiway D to the north</em>).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For reference, the 787-8 has a wingspan of 197ft 3in (60.12m).</p>

<p><em>3) Isn't that too close when there is another plane parked so close in proximity? Provided there is ample space available.</em></p>

<p>While crew must certainly take care to avoid collisions, planes can be parked very closely together if needed. See your question 6 for an example (also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_boneyard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boneyards</a> or <a href=""http://jalopnik.com/5660984/peeping-into-the-hangar-bay-of-a-us-navy-aircraft-supercarrier"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aircraft carrier hangars</a>). Since the planes will also be towed out of their positions, jet blast should not be a concern.</p>

<p>Although there is more space at KPAE than on an aircraft carrier and fewer planes than at a boneyard, there were still issues of space with so many planes on the ground. There were issues with production and engine availability as slookabill <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/10090/1696"">mentioned</a>, as well as the grounding due to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner_battery_problems"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">battery issues</a>.</p>

<p><em>4) Is it just that the scale of this picture, taken from a satellite, making them look closer than they really are?</em></p>

<p>The picture seems to be taken from close to directly overhead, so the apparent distance is probably fairly representative. Here's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CXhrKu_9hY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another view</a> for comparison.</p>

<p><em>5) What does that Double marking 7/91 Mean on the North East end of the small runway? usually that is a single number indicating the heading. That can't be 91, then what does that 91 mean?</em></p>

<p>As ratchetfreak <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/10093/1696"">mentioned</a>, the marking is at the north end of the runway, so it is meant to be viewed facing south as 16L.</p>

<p><em>6) Why are there a bunch of planes that are about stacked on top of each other towards the bottom right of the photo, on the ramp to 29?</em></p>

<p>Similar to the reasons explained for the other questions, the planes are parked for some period of time. The ground crews want the planes to take up as little area as possible. These appear to be 737's and are probably parked either for maintenance or for reasons similar to the 787 (production).</p>

"Why do some Air Forces not allow Color Blind Pilots?","5447","","<p>Some Air forces (Like the Indian Air force) do not allow Color Blind pilots. Is this local only to the IAF or a global procedure? Also, are there any regulations regarding commercial pilots not being Color Blind?</p>
","<p>In fact, most militaries don't take colorblind people into flight school.</p>

<p>Colorblindness can be a serious problem for a pilot, because in the interest of cost and/or simplicity, not all indicators in an aircraft cockpit are colorblind-accessible. It's really cheap to use a two-way red/green LED as a status indicator (and by quickly alternating the current through the LED you get amber); it's much more expensive in electro-mechanical systems to combine text and color so that the status can be deciphered by someone who is red-green colorblind. It becomes easier again in a glass cockpit, but that increases cost and there are still concerns like screen resolution to consider when designing text-and-color displays. While it's in the general interest of aviation manufacturers to design certain avionics with as many overlapping visual cues as possible, it's not always feasible to specifically design towards colorblind accessibility in every circumstance.</p>

<p>Here is a set of spectra simulating how various forms of colorblindness would change a person's perception of the normal color set:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQXHS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQXHS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Protanopia and deuteranopia are various forms of red-green colorblindness, the most common form of dichromia (protanopia is a deficiency in red cells, deuteranopia a deficiency in green; the results are similar because red and green are close in wavelength). Tritanopia is commonly called blue-yellow colorblindness and is less common, with full colorblindness (monochromia) being very rare.</p>

<p>From this chart, we can deduce the following basic difficulties for a red-green colorblind person attempting to operate a plane:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Red on brown, or any dark color, would have no contrast. That would make reading (and setting) this Cessna radio stack nearly impossible:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWn2O.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWn2O.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>... as well as decreasing the contrast of red lines on high-elevation sectionals (like Charlie/Echo space boundaries, non-towered airports, NDB frequencies etc):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nn134.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nn134.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Green and yellow are practically indistinguishable. That would make discerning the borders of inhabited low-lying areas on sectionals difficult:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j7Mkf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j7Mkf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>... as well as making the color-coding of this airspeed gauge much less useful at a glance:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6aDWA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6aDWA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Blue and magenta are indistinguishable, as are cyan and white. That makes your GPS useless over water; where's the magenta line?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DURKc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DURKc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>While you could probably get around most of these difficulties (buy a nav stack with blue LED displays, trace the borders of your sectional charts in something, configure the GPS to give you a white line, etc etc) these are all images that people with full color vision would be able to discern at a glance, which in an emergency situation is often a life-or-death advantage.</p>

<p>That point is especially true for military pilots, who are typically subject to more rigorous medical screening and training including very high requirements for visual acuity (often better than 20/20 uncorrected vision). If you can't see extremely well in a combat situation, you will either fail to spot an enemy until he has gained a significant advantage over you, or you will fire on friendly forces; either way, you're a liability. Coupled with the fact that everyone and their brother grew up dreaming of being a fighter pilot, flight schools get to be picky. Therefore, military aircraft cockpits are typically designed with the assumption of full color spectrum perception, because the only people who will ever be in them will be able to tell red from green, blue from yellow.</p>

<p>Consider, just as one example, a hypothetical conflict in the Middle East involving the Turks and Iranians, where NATO and thus the USAF is also involved. Both of these countries still operate variants of the F-4 Phantom. With an ROE requiring visual confirmation of a hostile, if you are in a USAF F-22, in a visual-range tangle with an F-4 whose IFF is inconclusive (either non-functioning or malfunctioning) and you can't tell the difference between these two rondels...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RvEhx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9byPI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>... you are screwed. The fact the Phantom is maneuvering against you is what any pilot would do when approached by an aggressor aircraft; a Turkish pilot isn't just going to sit there and be shot down by friendly fire, he'll engage defensive, so you can either shoot and risk spending the rest of your life in Leavenworth for dereliction of duty, or break engagement, presenting your tailpipe to the other craft and hoping it's not hostile. Fifty-fifty shot either way with a hundred and fifty million dollar plane on the line, not to mention your life. Your first clue it's an Iranian would be a missile launch, and no matter how much more advanced USAF craft are now than in the era of the F-4, an aircraft that has successfully launched a short-range missile at you has you by the wrinkly ones.</p>

<p>In addition, ground lighting systems are often not differentiable either. For instance, there is an important difference between a heliport beacon flashing green-yellow-white versus white-green-red (the one including a red flash is a hospital helipad and off-limits to gen-av traffic even in an emergency), but a red-green colorblind person may well not be able to tell the difference. Runway end lights are either green or red, indicating traffic direction (though there's usually a secondary cue of the approach array lights sequencing toward or away from the runway edge). Similarly, to a person for whom red is indistinguishable from white, the red-over-white glide slope indicator at the end of the runway would be useless (this would typically happen only with full colorblindness). Blue-yellow colorblindness is the other major type of partial colorblindness, and it would cause other problems like decreasing readability of navigation charts (for instance, incorporated land areas are yellow on FAA sectionals, while Victor routes and class B/D airspace borders are different blues) and trouble negotiating taxiways as the blue taxiway lights would look the same as yellow-white indicator lights elsewhere on the tarmac.</p>

"Why don't combat aircraft have rear-facing weapons?","5446","","<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14952/why-do-fighter-aircraft-manufacturers-still-focus-on-making-their-planes-more-do"">This excellent question</a> addresses the role of dogfighting in modern aerial warfare. However it seems that most ACM concentrate on maneuvering into shooting position. <strong>Why don't combat aircraft have rear-facing weaponry?</strong></p>

<p>Even WW-II bombers had rear-, side-, and downward cannons, albeit manned. Could a small electronically-controlled cannon be added to the stern dorsal part of a combat aircraft, for shooting rearward? I've personally seen remote-operated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_MAG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FN MAGS</a> on vehicles, the whole system seems to weigh on the order of 100-150 KG including hundreds of rounds. The vehicle-mounted systems took up about a cubic meter or so of space, but a purposed-designed system could probably take up less than half that, and probably shave off a good portion of the weight as well.</p>

<p>Could a computer not point a barrel at a vehicle with a relative velocity approaching 0 and shoot, even in a +Mach 1 wind <em>in the direction of the target</em>? It may be enough to just get a few bullets in, shotgun style. The Uzi rifles famously <em>don't</em> shoot straight, they make a cone of bullets. Perhaps this cone, if aimed in the general direction of an aggressive aircraft, might be enough to either disable it or get it off your tail. A short barrel will make a wider cone, perhaps the rear-facing weapon could have an very short barrel. ACMs such as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Cobra"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cobra maneuver</a> seem to imply that there are a finite number of angles from which attack is most likely, the weapon could be limited in angular range to those angles. </p>

<p>I'm sure that piloting an aircraft while trying to avoid being shot is difficult enough, so I wouldn't assume that such a system would be of much help on a single-seat aircraft. However, in a dogfight presumably the ROI or navigator could operate the guns while the pilot does the aviation.</p>
","<p>Machine guns were fairly effective weapons in WWII and shortly after. However, this was only because the attacking aircraft were also armed with machine guns. Even then, the fighter aircraft could be effective against not only the armed bombers, but also against the fighter escorts.</p>

<p>Bombers of the time did typically have tail gunners. However, this only resulted in a change of tactics, with fighters attacking from a different angle. Defending against one means of attack just means the attackers may choose a different attack vector.</p>

<p>However, the rocket age changed all this. Modern missiles can be fire-and-forget, automatically tracking a target from many miles away. Guns aren't very effective in this type of combat. In fact, <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/q/8686/1696"">it's debated whether fighter aircraft even need a forward facing gun anymore</a>. <a href=""http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/strike/2015/01/07/f35-gun-on-track/21401907/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The gun on the F-35 may not even be usable until after the first squadrons are operational</a>.</p>

<p>At high speeds, the rear-facing gun would have to overcome the forward velocity of the aircraft, decreasing its effectiveness.</p>

<p>One could imagine something like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CIWS</a> being helpful, but the weight and size would not justify the benefit for being included on a fighter, or even a bomber. Modern aircraft have chosen <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_countermeasure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">electronic defenses</a> over mechanical ones. These can be lighter, easier to integrate, and are more effective in a wide variety of situations.</p>

<p>However, combining the two ideas and <a href=""http://defensetech.org/2015/05/22/air-force-wants-to-fire-lasers-from-aircraft-by-2023/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arming aircraft with lasers</a> is still a possibility for the future.</p>

"What is the immediate cause of liftoff?","5440","","<p>If I understand correctly, when a plane transitions from takeoff roll to being airborne, it is not something that happens ""by itself"" when the airspeed is high enough, but is caused by deliberate pilot input somehow.</p>

<p>Which control surfaces are involved in causing the plane to lift off?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it an ordinary nose-up movement of the elevators? That is, the elevators create negative lift that pushes the tailplane <em>down</em>, which makes the entire aircraft pivot around the main gear and increases the wings' AoA enough to create lift that takes the plane off the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Or is it something that increases lift with unchanged attitude, such as a symmetric aileron movement, or an additional flaps extension? And then <em>after</em> the plane is airborne it is rotated to climbing attitude?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The descriptions I can easily Google up point towards 1. However, while that makes perfect sense for tricycle gear I don't see how that would work with taildraggers. Pushing down on the tail would just increase the downward force on the tail wheel rather than change the AoA.</p>
","<p>The answer is indeed (a). For tailwheel aircraft, what typically happens is typically the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>With all 3 wheels on the ground, you start gaining speed by increasing thrust.</li>
<li>Very soon (e.g. much sooner that the minimum take-off speed), you push the stick to lift the tailwheel off the ground and put the aircraft at more or less zero AoA.</li>
<li>When you reach the rotate speed, you pull to increase the AoA and to lift off (as with tricycles). The required pitch up angle is much smaller than what would be needed for the tail wheel to touch the ground again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you may keep the tailwheel on the ground all the way until liftoff. Since with the tailwheel on the ground your AoA is positive, you just need to reach enough speed to generate the required lift for take-off. This may not be possible with all tailwheel aircraft or may increase take-off run length, though.</p>

"How does the dihedral angle work?","5424","","<p>I've been looking for this topic on the internet but I don't have enough concrete answers. Suppose we have a plane with dihedral and it has a suddenly swinging to the right (watching from the nose of the plane), so the right wing goes down. I'm trying to understand why the right wing generates more lift than the left wing when it has a sideslip. I have seen in some sites that the sideslip induces a flow from the tip to the root and this makes the right wing increase locally the angle of attack, hence the lift of this wing increases too. </p>

<p>But, why the right wing increases the angle of attack? I think it couldn't be possible because the sideslip flow is in a different plane respect the mainstream.</p>
","<p>Basically, dihedral effect is that during banking, the 'lower' wing will experience a higher angle of attack compared to the 'higher' wing, and a result, a greater lift. The resulting net force and moment reduces the banking angle, reducing stability.</p>

<p>Consider a wing with a dihedral angle $\Gamma$ with a forward airspeed of $u$. If the sideslip angle is $\beta$, the wind due to sideslip is $u \cdot sin\beta$. From geometry, the normal velocity induced due to dihedral, $v_{n}$ becomes $u \cdot sin\beta \cdot sin\Gamma$. </p>

<p>Note: The notations are different in the figure; but the principle is the same.</p>

<p>For our purposes, we can take the sideslip velocity ($u \cdot sin\beta$) as $v_{y}$. Now, consider two sections from the wing- one each from the 'lower' and 'higher' sides. The induced velocity is of the same magnitude in both the sides, while the direction differs, as can be seen from the above figure.</p>

<p>For small angles, $v_{y}$ is nearly equal to $u \beta$. The induced angle can be given as,</p>

<p>$\Delta \alpha = \frac{v_{n}}{u}$.</p>

<p>From the earlier relations, we have,</p>

<p>$\Delta \alpha_{1} = \beta \cdot sin\Gamma$, and $\Delta \alpha_{2} = -\beta \cdot sin\Gamma$.</p>

<p>Because of these induced angles, the lift on the downgoing wing increases by $\Delta L$, while of the other one decreases by $\Delta L$. The net result is that the 'lower' wing experiences an increases lift, causing a rolling moment, which causes the banking angle to reduce.</p>

"What is the legal interpretation of rest for FAA Part 135 operations?","5422","","<p><a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=224e5eff75b49b3d4b23f02c9958f369&amp;node=14:3.0.1.1.11.6&amp;rgn=div6"">14 CFR 135, Subpart F</a> contains the rest requirements for Part 135 operations.</p>

<p>The rest requirement for 1 and 2 pilot unscheduled crews (typical) comes from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>135.267(d)</strong><br>
  Each assignment under paragraph (b) of this section must provide for at least 10 consecutive hours of rest during the 24-hour
  period that precedes the planned completion time of the assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does the FAA consider rest and what actions by the company will interrupt the required rest?</p>
","<p>The 10 hours of rest need to be uninterrupted, planned, and not spent on call. Essentially, the pilots need to have 10 hours in which they are not obligated to do <strong>any work for the company</strong> <em>at all</em>.  Note that it does not mean ""10 hours of sleep"", and it is up to the pilot what they do with their time off.  (They can even technically fly for another 135 operator during that time, but they run the risk of being ""careless and reckless"" if they aren't well rested.)</p>

<p>NATA has <a href=""http://www.nata.aero/data/files/abj/FAA_legal_interpretations_abj.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">an article about some of the FAA's legal interpretations (pdf)</a> that's pretty interesting and relatively recent (2011). Their paraphrase of the FAA's varying interpretations is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the FAA has said that for a “rest period” to be legal it must be: 1) continuous, 2) determined prospectively (i.e. known in advance) and 3) free from all restraint from the certificate holder, including freedom from work or freedom from the present responsibility for work should the occasion arise.  Being on call is specifically mentioned as not rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interpretation that is repeated throughout a lot of articles and forum discussions. It's also often pointed out that many (most?) 135 carriers blatantly ignore these rules, as most charter operations require pilots to be on call.</p>

<h2>For example</h2>

<p>You arrive at 19:00, and are done with paperwork / postflight / etc by 19:30 and leave the airport. The moment that you leave the airport is the beginning of your rest period; it will need to last 10 uninterrupted hours, which means until at least 0530 the next morning (1930 to 0530) to mean anything.</p>

<p>If you get a call from dispatch at 21:00 telling you about a flight that might take place in the morning and that you must be available for a call at 05:00 just in case - your rest ends at 05:00. Because your rest period ended 30 minutes early (when you were required to be available), you did not get the 10 hours of rest and can't take a flight without violating 135.267(d).</p>

<h2>Another caveat:</h2>

<p>There are no explicit limits on duty time (the exception being 135.267(c) involving a ""regularly assigned duty period of no more than 14 hours"" which doesn't apply to most 135 operators).  The limit is on <strong><em>planned flying</em></strong> conducted under 135. </p>

<p>As long as you <strong>plan</strong> on parking the airplane when you can show 10 hours of rest in the previous 24 hours (which is why some people incorrectly assume that you are limited to 14 hours of duty: 24 - 10 = 14!), you can be kept on duty afterwards.  You can even fly under Part 91 for the company.  You can clean the airplane, or do office work.  While none of that is rest and it is still duty, it is legal unless you get in the airplane to fly under Part 135 without getting the required rest.</p>

"Is the hydraulic fluid artificially colored?","5421","","<p>A normal aircraft has multiple hydraulic circuit, identified by colors (e.g. according to the ATSB final report of the QF32 the green hydraulic line was disabled; according to the BEA final report of the AF4590 the Concorde had a yellow, a blue and a green circuit, ...). I understand the need to be equipped of several independant hydraulic system (redundancy) and the need of being able to identify those. </p>

<p>Thanks to the previous example, I figured out the hydraulic circuits are identify by colors. 
Does it mean the hydraulic fluid is colored (useful in case of leak)? Does it means the elements of each circuit is painted accordingly (usefull for maintenance)? </p>
","<p>A common hydraulic fluid used in aircraft is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skydrol"" rel=""noreferrer"">Skydrol</a>. The fluid is artificially colored, but this does not depend on which circuit it is in. The <a href=""http://www.skydrol.com/pages/faqs.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">FAQ</a> on the manufacturer's site addresses the color.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Skydrol fluids are given a <strong>purple dye</strong> to make it easy to distinguish them from other fluids. But the dye does not usually last as long as the fluid does. <strong>The color may change from purple to gray or yellow or green,</strong> yet the fluid can still meet all used fluid specifications. <strong>Color is not a reliable indicator of fluid quality</strong>, and we recommend that the system be sampled for chemical analysis to determine if it is suitable for use. A dark amber color, however, is a cause for concern, and can indicate a severely stressed fluid. Call Solutia's Technical Service for assistance if you are unsure about a fluid's color. Our technical bulletin has a color chart to use as a guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially the color helps to distinguish from other fluids, and having multiple colors would make it more complicated. It notes that the color also does not remain constant, so even if it were colored initially, it would probably end up changing anyway. It also mentions that a dark amber color can be an indicator of issues.</p>

<p>I can't find any good pictures, but the lines are probably not color coded. Any colored hydraulic system components are generally purple (like the fluid). The lines themselves <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_handbook/media/FAA-8083-30_Ch07.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">can be labeled</a>, but the standard for hydraulic lines is <a href=""https://www.compaero.com/pdf/FLUID%20LINE.PDF"" rel=""noreferrer"">blue and yellow</a>. The end fittings are colored to identify the tube material type.</p>

<p>The maintenance manuals will show the layout and label the different lines. Also, on <a href=""http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/callback/cb_402.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this ASRS page</a>, one report is from a mechanic that confused the green and yellow system fittings, which probably wouldn't have happened if they were color coded.</p>

"Do any aircraft out there use negative lift?","5421","","<p>I think negative lift is where high pressure forms on the top of the wing instead of the bottom. I know that Indy cars use negative lift and some sports cars do, but do any aircraft exist that use negative lift and why do they use negative lift?</p>
","<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> Yes</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer:</strong> Well, partially....You see, lift is generated not only at the wings but also at the tail. The aircraft's tail has an elevator and a rudder (most single engine planes) by way of control structures. The pitching motion of the airplane is caused by altering the elevator's shape. The nose stays where it is (in the vertical plane) when the lift at the wings is balanced by that at the tail. However, when the lift at the tail increases the nose starts dropping. Similarly, when the lift at the tail decreases, the nose rises up. You could call the increased downward at the tail 'negative-lift'.</p>

<p>I hope that answered your question.

<ol>
<li><p>The plausible answer is to maintain the correct center of gravity.

<li><p>Lastly, I remember on a TV documentary it was stated that the reason is so the wing would not deform upwards (again I don't see how).</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Your reason 1 is correct. Without the ballast the aircraft would become a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/16962"">taildragger</a>.</p>

<p>Why not pallets? This would produce the same center of gravity location, but a different mass distribution. Clearing this configuration even for being loaded and pushed around is more effort than simply placing the ballast where the mass of the engines would go. Now all clearances are valid and the aircraft can be handled much as one with the engines in place.</p>

<p>Next, engines are only installed shortly before delivery or first flight. The cost of capital is too high to install them any sooner.</p>

","<p>It is to help the pilot land the aircraft (the chase cars are also used during takeoff). The U2 is considered notoriously difficult to fly in low altitudes- a tradeoff in an <a href=""http://jalopnik.com/5537629/the-140-mph-chase-cars-of-the-us-air-force"" rel=""noreferrer"">aircraft optimized for very high altitude flight</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because the U-2 was so specialized, it was amazingly difficult to fly. ... the lower the U-2 flew, the heavier its unassisted controls got, to the point where pilots literally had to brute-force the plane around during take-off and landing. </p>
  
  <p>... landings were the biggest problem. The replacement for Johnson's cart-and-skid ground system was a compact setup — two centrally located landing gear in the fuselage and one detachable ""pogo"" gear on each wing — that turned the U-2 into little more than a 30,000-pound bicycle. Because of the high-lift wings, pilots didn't so much land the plane as fly it really close to the ground (usually about two feet), stall it, and then fall out of the sky. </p>

"When flying a circling approach, is it permitted to begin the visual circling segment prior to the final approach fix?","5386","","<p>If it were a beautiful sunny VFR day and you were cleared for a circling approach, can you begin the circle prior to the final approach fix/circling DH in order to maneuver visually to land?</p>

<p>Here are two examples of situations where it would be very useful, and both are real life clearances that I have gotten multiple times:</p>

<hr>

<h1>Example 1 - KASE</h1>

<p>Clearance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>N1234, Cleared for the VOR/DME-C approach, cleared to land runway 15</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UgSIl.png"" alt=""KASE VOR/DME-C""></p>

<p>If you follow the step downs until the final approach fix (ZIGBU) you will be at 2,983 ft. above the runway (10,820 ft. MSL) with 2.9 miles to go (9.61 degree descent angle).  To put this in perspective, on a normal 3 degree descent, you should be at 870 ft. above the runway so are over 2,000 ft. high on less than a 3 mile final.</p>

<p>Could you begin the circle early and descend while visually avoiding any obstacles prior to the step-down fixes?  Say cross ALLIX at 11,000 ft. and ZIGBU at 9,000 ft. (assuming that this cleared all obstacles)? Keep in mind that this is a circling approach so we will be operating below the MDA visually at some point on final anyway. </p>

<p>If not, then it would be nearly impossible to land straight-in while flying most jets, and yet I have never seen anyone do a 360 or a similar maneuver while on final here (and who would want to do that in the valley anyway??).</p>

<hr>

<h1>Example 2 - KTEB</h1>

<p>Clearance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>N1234, Cleared for the ILS Runway 6 Circle Runway 1 Approach, cleared to land runway 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1H9r.png"" alt=""KTEB ILS 6""></p>

<p>If I fly the ILS (localizer and glideslope) until reaching circling minimums, especially in a category C or D airplane and with this runway layout, it will take a lot of room to turn right for a base leg to runway 1 and then turn back left to intercept final and lose the required altitude.</p>

<p>Could you start the circle a little sooner by making the right turn early (prior to DH, but still within the protected circling area) in order to intercept the extended final for runway 1?</p>
","<p>While researching this subject, I found a few things that shed light on the subject:</p>

<h1>Procedures</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0408.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">FAA ATC Order 4-8-1</a> Note 1 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Clearances authorizing instrument approaches are issued on the basis that, if visual contact with the ground is made before the
  approach is completed, the entire approach procedure will be followed
  unless the pilot receives approval for a contact approach, is cleared
  for a visual approach, or cancels their IFR flight plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we have to follow the entire approach, which includes all mandatory altitudes.</p>

<h1>Aspen Approach</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/ATC/atc0310.html#atc0310.html.6"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>AIM 5-4-20. Approach and Landing Minimums</strong></a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. Straight-in Minimums are shown on the IAP when the final approach
  course is within 30 degrees of the runway alignment (15 degrees for
  GPS IAPs) and a normal descent can be made from the IFR altitude shown
  on the IAP to the runway surface. When either the normal rate of
  descent or the runway alignment factor of 30 degrees (15 degrees for
  GPS IAPs) is exceeded, a straight-in minimum is not published and a
  circling minimum applies. The fact that a straight-in minimum is not
  published does not preclude pilots from landing straight-in if they
  have the active runway in sight and have sufficient time to make a
  normal approach for landing. Under such conditions and when ATC has
  cleared them for landing on that runway, pilots are not expected to
  circle even though only circling minimums are published. If they
  desire to circle, they should advise ATC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key part for this discussion is that, for approaches that would be straight-in if it weren't for the high descent rate on final (like the KASE approach), <strong>pilots are not expected to circle even though only circling minimums are published. If they desire to circle, they should advise ATC.</strong></p>

<p>Well, in this case we can't land straight-in after making the last crossing restriction, so what can we do?</p>

<p>Combining the two quoted passages, our options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get approval for a contact approach</li>
<li>Get approval for a visual approach</li>
<li>Cancel our IFR flight plan</li>
<li>Get approval to circle since we can't land straight-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three are pretty straight-forward and can be used if you pick up the airport visually in time.  </p>

<p>If you need to circle, I found a great article called <a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/1430.PDF"" rel=""noreferrer"">Circle-To-Land Tactics</a> which was written by a former chairman of the ALPA TERPs committee.  He suggests overflying the runway and then flying a modified pattern:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lG6jV.png"" alt=""circle pattern""></p>

<h1>Teterboro Approach</h1>

<p>We can't start our circle until we are within the protected circling area.  This means that for my category C airplane, I have to wait until 1.7 NM from the runway threshold before I can begin my turn.  </p>

<p>We could make a right 90 degree turn followed by a left 90 degree turn to line up on final, but that would eat up about one mile just by turning.  Since runway 1 is actually closer to us than 6 at this point, I have even less distance to work with and can't even see the runway during the first turn because we are banking the wrong direction.  This would be pretty tight.</p>

<p>In this case, the previous article recommends a circle like this (which would be modified for our actual runway layout):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gNFUY.png"" alt=""KTEB Circle""></p>

<p>In good visual conditions, I would just ask for a visual approach so that we can start the turn a little sooner and land ""more"" straight-in without flying all over the airport.</p>

<hr>

<p>One last point:  Since there is a control tower at both of these airport, make sure that they know what we are going to do!  </p>

"Why was the P-51 Mustang not adopted by the U.S. Navy?","5381","","<p>I've heard from many WWII aviation hobbyists and WWII vets that the P-51 was essentially the pinnacle of U.S. piston-engine fighter design; it was fast, maneuverable, long-range, well-armed, allowed superb pilot visibility, etc etc.</p>

<p>So, why did the Navy never adopt it? It seems there were flight tests of the P-51D as a carrier fighter, modified with a tailhook for wire capture landings, but the Navy never pulled the trigger (so to speak). What were the primary reasons behind this decision?</p>
","<p>The biggest driver behind the use of the P-51 Mustang in naval operations was the need for B-29 escorts while bombing Japan. No naval fighter at the time had the range to accompany the B-29's so the P-51D was selected to determine if it could be a suitable carrier operator.</p>

<p>The test project was named ""Project Seahorse"", and one aircraft was selected and specially modified to cope with carrier landings. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FtjhJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FtjhJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<em>Navy Concept Image in Livery</em> <sup><a href=""http://mustang.gaetanmarie.com/articles/naval/naval.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Image Source)</a></sup></p>

<p>The modifications included:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Fin Fillet Extension"" which enhanced low-speed operation.<br></li>
<li>Tail hook (for obvious reasons)<br></li>
<li>Catapult hook <br></li>
<li>High pressure tires <br></li>
<li>Higher pressure in the shock absorbers</li>
<li>Reinforced airframe</li>
</ul>

<p>The modified P-51D started testing in September of 1944 under test pilot Robert Elder. The tests were carried out at Mustin Field in Phillidelphia on a modified runway fitted with a catapult and arresting cables. Throughout September 1944 to October 1944, 150 launches and recoveries were made on this modified runway. One big concern was that the aircraft would need to land around 90mph and the stall speed was 82mph, not much of a margin.</p>

<p>In late October 1944 the next stage of testing started, carrier landings/launches at sea. Lt. Elder made all the carrier landings at 85mph and was pleased with its handling characteristics, but there were issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stall speed margin was extremely low, too low for safety</li>
<li>Rudder control at low speed and high angles of attack was inadequate</li>
<li>Landing attitude had to be very carefully controlled to avoid airframe damage</li>
<li>Go-arounds required slow throttle advancement. The extreme power of the Packard/Merlin engine meant that a high-power fast throttle advancement could put the aircraft into a roll or snap-roll. At low speeds this would prove a fatal mistake. </li>
</ul>

<p>Only 25 launches/recoveries were made in the suitability trials and Lt. Elder did not believe that the Mustang had a place in carrier operations.</p>

<p>It was a moot point anyway. By early 1945 Okinawa and Iwo Jima were won by the allied forces. Each island had airfields that were taken over and provided a close base of operations for aerial attacks on Japan. In August 1945 Japan announced its surrender and it was official September 2, 1945. The P-51 wasn't required to be used from a naval platform anymore.</p>

<p>The project wasn't forgotten though. North American presented the NAA-133 based on the P-51H, which was a carrier operations ""Mustang"". It didn't go any further than the design stage though. In 1947 a P-51H was acquired to test new catapult equipment. Either way the war was over by that time and we didn't have to put any more effort into modifying the aircraft for carrier operations.</p>

"Is it legal to fly in RVSM airspace with an inoperative autopilot?","5376","","<p><a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.3.10&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.3.10.13.9.3.32"">FAR Part 91, Appendix G, Section 2</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) <em>Altitude-keeping equipment: All aircraft.</em> To approve an aircraft
  group or a nongroup aircraft, the Administrator must find that the
  aircraft meets the following requirements:</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p><code></code> <code></code>(2) The aircraft must be equipped with at least one automatic altitude
  control system that controls the aircraft altitude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that it does <strong>not</strong> say that it must be engaged, or even operative.  Simply ""equipped"", and also that this is to <strong>approve</strong> an aircraft for RVSM.  From what I can find, there is no operational requirement for the autopilot to actually be working or engaged.  </p>

<p>Assuming that my MEL allows me to defer the autopilot and still fly, can I fly in RVSM airspace?  Some people however say that if you are in RVSM airspace that the autopilot must be <strong>working</strong> and <strong>engaged</strong>.  Right or wrong?</p>
","<p>About whether or not you can fly with an inoperative autopilot, take a look at §91.180:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>§91.180   Operations within airspace designated as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum airspace.</h3>
  
  <p>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person may
  operate a civil aircraft in airspace designated as Reduced Vertical
  Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace unless:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>The operator and <strong>the operator's aircraft comply with the minimum
  standards of appendix G of this part</strong>; and</li>
  <li>The operator is authorized by the Administrator or the country of
  registry to conduct such operations.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>(b) The Administrator may authorize a deviation from the requirements
  of this section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also can't <em>say</em> that your aircraft is allowed to operate in RVSM airspace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Section 4. RVSM Operations</em></p>
  
  <p>(a) Each person requesting a clearance to operate within RVSM airspace
  shall correctly annotate the flight plan filed with air traffic
  control with the status of the operator and aircraft with regard to
  RVSM approval. Each operator shall verify RVSM applicability for the
  flight planned route through the appropriate flight planning
  information sources.</p>
  
  <p>(b) <strong>No person may show, on the flight plan filed with air traffic
  control, an operator or aircraft as approved for RVSM operations, or
  operate on a route or in an area where RVSM approval is required,
  unless:</strong></p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>The operator is authorized by the Administrator to perform such
  operations; and</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>The aircraft has been approved and complies with the requirements
  of Section 2 of this appendix.</strong></p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If it's not operational, the aircraft no longer qualities for RVSM, and therefore must be provided with 2000 feet vertical separation (each way) between other aircraft. Alternatively, ATC can refuse entry into RVSM airspace.</p>

<p>Regarding having the autopilot engaged, <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2091-85.pdf"">Appendix 4 of AC 91-85</a>, Section ""5. In-flight Procedures"" states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>e. An automatic altitude-control system should be operative and engaged during level cruise, except when circumstances such as the need to retrim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement. In any event, adherence to cruise altitude should be done by reference to one of the two primary altimeters; </p>

"I accidentally deviated from an ATC instruction as a student pilot. How bad was it?","5366","","<p>Here's the scenario: I was a student pilot on inbound for landing at my home airport on my final solo cross country flight I needed before doing a checkride.</p>

<p>At roughly 8 miles out to the north west, I established contact with the tower and was told to ""enter left base, runway 7, report 3 miles out."" I interpreted the ""report 3 miles out"" as to give the tower a call when I was 3 miles away from the field, ie, when my GPS indicated I was 3 miles from the field.</p>

<p>Now, it was the most windy day I had flown solo in so far (15kt gusts) so I wanted to make sure I had ample time to line up with the runway on final and get a feeling for how the winds were blowing since the ATIS reported them as being variable in direction.</p>

<p>That said, what I ended up doing was making a wide base, except apparently I made it a little too wide because the GPS did not indicate I was 3 miles from the field until I was on final. At this point, I called the tower, reported I was on a 3 mile final and was given clearance to land. After landing, I still had no idea I had done anything incorrectly as the controller made no indication to me.</p>

<p>A few hours after I landed, my CFI sent me a text message asking me how ""report a 3 mile base"" meant ""report a 3 mile final and fly a straight in approach."" I'm not sure if he was on the frequency when it happened or if the tower controller called him after the fact and told him about it because I was told to ""report 3 miles out"", not ""report 3 mile base.""</p>

<p>I completely understand that I made my base leg too wide and that caused me to deviate from an ATC instruction. What I'm wondering is how bad of a screw up is this? My CFI's reaction was one of legitimate anger and it makes me want to stay on the ground for a while.</p>
","<p>Well, you screwed up, but nobody got hurt, no metal was bent, and since the tower didn't yell at you presumably you didn't <em>obviously</em> endanger anyone's safety (though there's always some level of risk when an aircraft isn't where the tower expects it to be).  </p>

<p>As far as deviations go, that's not <em>good</em>, but it's not terrible. The tower was probably expecting you to report 3 miles out, continuing in to about a mile from the field for your downwind.</p>

<p>Schedule an extra half hour of ground time with your CFI before your next flight to talk about what happened. Also take the time to fill out <a href=""http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov"">an ASRS report explaining what happened and why</a> (It's probably unnecessary in this case, as a student the tower will almost certainly be satisfied with you getting ""a good talking-to"" from your instructor, but it's a good way to learn how that system works.)</p>

<hr>

<p>There are a couple of other things you might want to do on your next few training flights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Spend some time getting comfortable in the pattern on windy days.</strong><br>
You should be comfortable in a tighter pattern than 3 miles, even on a windy day (see my next item for why). This takes practice, and fortunately for you it's spring (at least in the USA) so there are plenty of windy days in most of the country!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice some engine-out approaches to get a feel for your plane's glide performance.</strong><br>
A base leg 3 miles out in a typical GA trainer is <em>very</em> wide -- Remember you generally want to be able to make <em>some spot on the runway</em> if your engine quits on downwind, and you probably can't do that from 1000 feet AGL at 3 miles out.<br>
Take a few laps around the pattern and have your instructor pull the power at various points so you have a feeling for how the energy management works out - this will give you a good feel for how wide your pattern should be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turn the GPS <em>off</em> and practice flying visually.</strong><br>
The GPS is one link link in your error chain, but I think it's a <em>big one</em>: If you were flying visually and relying on landmarks to judge your distance rather than the 3 mile alert from your GPS you might have realized ""Hey, I'm entering downwind - I should tell the tower!""</p></li>

"What are the differences in aircraft performance between tractor and pusher propeller designs?","5355","","<p>Some aircraft have pusher type propellers.  In what ways is it different from a tractor type propeller?  What's are the advantages and disadvantages over a tractor type.</p>
","<p>Well one major difference is the blade pitch, pusher props will seem to be backwards. </p>

<p>You must also modify the engine's bearings to be able to support the propeller mounting and crankshaft in compression, rather than tension.</p>

<p>A pusher prop's engine also has to be cooled differently than a tractor, because the propeller is not blowing air over the engine. Therefore some ducting and ram air magic has to be done, or some other system of cooling implemented. Many pusher-type planes have had severe issues with cooling.</p>

<p>Note: some of the next few might not necessarily apply to pusher-type planes where the engine is mounted above the fuselage, like the Lake Amphibian and many other seaplanes, or some other oddities like the B-36. I am talking about more conventional pushers like the Velocity, Beech Starship, or Cessna 337.</p>

<p>Another issue is FOD. A pusher prop will likely be mounted behind at least one of the wheels, which can kick dirt and rocks up into the propeller. Now imagine a prop that is very close to one of the mains. Even on paved runways you encounter rocks and debris occasionally, and it only takes one hit in the right place to produce a failure-causing nick.</p>

<p>Compounding on that last one, when a tractor-type plane takes off, beacause the prop is forward of the center of mass, the propeller will rotate <em>up</em>, away from the ground. But a pusher prop is usually just the opposite: it will rotate <em>down</em> a bit, increasing the chances of a prop-strike. This is one that is heavily considered and worked-around while building pusher-type planes, but while you can mitigate the danger by placing the prop closer to the CM, or making the landing gear taller, you can't completely remove it as far as I know.</p>

"How is an aircraft aligned at a jet bridge?","5352","","<p>I see these jet bridges (or aerobridges) at nearly every new airport I go to. How are aircraft aligned with these bridges, particularly the A380 which has doors on both of its decks?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How are aircraft aligned with these bridges</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>They are not</strong> (but read on)</p>

<p>Aircraft are aligned to a point on the concrete, not to the jetbridge(s).</p>

<p>It is the jetbridge itself that carries out the final alignment to the aircraft door.</p>

<p>Jetbridges are actually motor vehicles with wheels, tyres, motors and (often) steering. It just happens that their rear end is tethered and their bodies articulate and/or telescope to accomodate the motion at the ""front"" end..</p>

<p>I believe some also have what is effectively variable height suspension like old Citroens (except I imagine it is hydraulic or jack-screw).</p>

<p>The aircraft is driven to the terminal so the nose wheel follows a  guide line and stops at a marking appropriate for the aircraft type. Then the jet bridge is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7_1zK9Mq8c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">driven</a> up to the aircraft door.</p>

<p>As the aircraft is gradually burdened with self-loading freight and sinks on it's suspension, the jetbridge metaphorically <a href=""http://www.core77.com/posts/25999/what-gains-50000-pounds-in-15-minutes-25999"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bends its knees</a> so that the SLF don't trip up or fall into the aircraft. That is, the jetbridge maintains alignment, the aircraft is pretty passive in the job of alignment.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have to admit I didn't notice these jetbridge controls for many years as I was usually either busy rushing to my seat or busy rushing to the baggage reclaim. One time there was a delay at the aircraft door that was long enough for my bored gaze to alight on the controls and for the thought to briefly wander across my mind - ""I wonder what would happen if I pressed that ...""</p>

<p>From your perspective it isn't a too important distinction.  As a commercial pilot all that matters to you is that both air carriers and commercial operators need to have operating certificates.  As a commercial pilot you can be hired by someone who has an operating certificate but you cannot provide the same services on your own unless you yourself have an operating certificate (e.g. a charter operator can hire you, but you cannot operate a charter service).</p>

"Why is the PIC position for helicopters the right seat, rather than the left seat as in airplanes?","5338","","<p>So far as I am aware, in a fixed wing aircraft having side-by-side seating and  dual controls but only a single set of instruments, those instruments are always positioned in front of the left seat. Even when an aircraft (such as commercial air transport) is fitted with dual instruments, the left seat is designated as the ""pilot-in-command"" or ""captain's"" position. This ""left-seat as principal"" designation appears to hold true for any fixed wing aircraft from a Cessna 152 to a Boeing 747, in all jurisdictions of manufacture and operation.</p>

<p>For a helicopter, the situation appears to be reversed - the ""pilot in command"" appears to always occupy the right seat.</p>

<p>Is this true, always, or is it an observational bias? Is this simply convention or is it specified by regulation? What would account for exceptions, if any?</p>
","<p>The reason is both historical and operational.</p>

<p>The first mass produced helicopter was the Sikorsky R-4.  It had a single collective located between the two pilot seats, so by necessity, the person on the right would control the cyclic with their right hand, and the person on the left would control the cyclic with their left (because their right is needed on the collective).  The cyclic in the R-4 was very difficult to manipulate and required a lot of strength and coordination.  Since the vast majority of student helicopter pilots were right handed, they sat in the right seat, allowing them to use their dominant hand on the cyclic.  Thus, the first generation of helicopter pilots all sat in the right seat, since they all learned on the R-4 (or the R-6).  That's how traditions begin.</p>

<p>The operational applications of sitting in the right seat relate to the inherent instability of a helicopter. A helicopter pilot rarely wants to let go of the cyclic, as it often requires continuous control inputs, especially when hovering. The collective, on the other hand, does not need to be monitored as closely and can be held steady with a friction adjustment, so that hand is occasionally free to manipulate things like radios and other equipment, which are located in the center of the cockpit.  </p>

<p>Most helicopters these days have a collective for each seat, located on the left, so the pilot wants to use the hand in the middle of the cockpit to work the radios and things.  Hence, they sit on the right side, which places the collective hand in the middle of the cockpit.</p>

"What causes stall buffeting?","5303","","<p>From other answers I've gathered that stall occurs when the air flow separates from the wing surface. And also that this starts at the back of the wing and progresses forward as AOA increases.</p>

<p>Is this process not uniform? What causes the buffeting just under the stall AOA? Is it simply the turbulence behind the point of separation?</p>

<p>Also, what factors, such as speed, altitude or air density affect the amount of buffeting?</p>
","<p>Not all stalls start from the trailing edge and progresses forward. In general, <a href=""http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVroGcuJvKAhUJJI4KHQvVDGsQFgg1MAY&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnaca.central.cranfield.ac.uk%2Freports%2F1951%2Fnaca-tn-2502.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdDImh38AMYMfPXqlixd8x69UtBQ&amp;bvm=bv.111396085,d.c2E&amp;cad=rja"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">three types of stall are described</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trailing edge stall- This is the preferred stall characteristic; The turbulent separation point moves forward from the trailing edge with increasing angle of attack. usually found in airfoil sections with thickness ratios 0.15 and greater.</p></li>
<li><p>Leading edge stall- The flow separates abruptly from the leading edge without subsequent reattachment; usually found in airfoils with thickness ratios between 0.09 and 0.15.</p></li>
<li><p>Thin airfoil stall- Found in airfoils with small thickness (&lt; 0.09), the separation occurs at the leading edge and the flow reattaches at a point which then moves progressively rearward with increase in angle of attack.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Buffet is a kind of <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_16/vibration_story.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vibration caused by aerodynamic excitation</a>, usually associated with separated (or turbulent) airflow. As the aircraft approaches stall, the airflow over the wing becomes turbulent and if it flows across the horizontal stabilizer, buffeting may occur. </p>

<p>Whether low speed (stall) buffet happens or not depends on the aircraft characteristics; for example, the stall starts from the root in case of straight wings and the stabilizer is affected by the turbulent airflow before the outer wing stalls- this can be used by the pilot to take corrective action (as @Ron Beyer points out in his comments). In case of swept wing aircraft, the stall progresses the other way around- from tips to rot and it will be difficult for the pilot to use buffet in any real sense.</p>

<p>This buffeting can act as a warning for the pilot that the aircraft is approaching stall and he/she has to take corrective action. In aircraft that do not show this behavior, some warning cues, like stick shaker are sometimes incorporated in order to warn the pilot.</p>

<p>As density altitude increases, the angle of attack required to produce turbulence at the top of the wing (stall angle) decreases till a point is reached that the high speed buffet (Mach buffet, due to supersonic airflow) and the stall buffet (as already explained) converge. This point is called the coffin corner.</p>

"Why does the B777 have no winglets? Are there any drawbacks to having winglets?","5297","","<p>I have googled and noticed that almost every Boeing 777 is not equipped with winglets. Does anybody know the reasons why Boeing did not equip B777s with winglets? Are there any drawbacks to having winglets?</p>
","<p>As in anything in aviation design, the use of wingtips has both advantages and disadvantages. In the end, the decision to use (or not) a winglet is based on the cost-benefit analysis of the winglet to be used in that particular aircraft.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All winglets incur a drag and weight penalty- the question is whether they conserve fuel more than they increase it in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>One problem in winglet addition is that they are prone to flutter.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, an <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8556/is-a-winglet-better-than-an-equal-span-extension"">equal span extension</a> is sometimes more effective and is less risky.</p></li>
<li><p>Another thing to add is that most of the present aircraft using winglets (A320s and B737s) were not designed with winglets to begin with. They were retrofits. Most of the new aircraft are designed with plenty of aerodynamic experience and the engineers can take a call based on the data available as to whether to have 'conventional' winglet or not (See A350XWB Vs B787).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Coming to B777, it should be noted that they have wingtip devices after all- raked wingtips. These act in the same manner as the winglets to reduce drag.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OfK5A.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OfK5A.jpg"" alt=""777 wingtip""></a></p>

<p>Boeing 777 raked wingtip; image from <a href=""http://www.boeingimages.com/archive/777-300ER-Wingtip-2F3XC55GZK9.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boeing.com</a></p>

<p>According to Boeing,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each wing on the Boeing 777-300ER (extended range) is being extended by 6.5 feet, and raked wingtips are being added to improve the overall aerodynamic efficiency. The raked wingtips help reduce takeoff field length, increase climb performance and reduce fuel burn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, these act in the same manner as the conventional wingtips. Also, it is crucial to consider the tradeoff. B777 was designed when the advantages of the wingtips were well known, yet they decided to go without one anyway. From <a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/how-things-work-winglets-2468375/?no-ist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">airspacemag</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because winglets are a tradeoff: In the highly visible case of the 777, an airplane with exceptionally long range, the wings grew so long that folding wingtips were offered to get into tight airport gates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/19296/9731"">nobody ordered the folding wingtips</a> when they were first ordered, though that has not stopped Boeing from trying. Note that one main reason for offering folding wings is to fit into existing gates- else the wingspan would've become too great.</p>

<p>Boeing considered all the options before deciding to go with this option:</p>

  <p>Dave Akiyama, manager of aerodynamics engineering in Boeing product development, points out that designing winglets can be tricky-they have a tendency to flutter, for example.

"Was the ""Air Berlin"" lap of honor over Düsseldorf problematic?","5294","","<p>A few days ago, flight AB 7001 (Air Berlin, New York - Düsseldorf) went for a ""lap of honor"" around the airport.<br>
One video can be found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nVOlVAu8t0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.<br>
No emergency or technical issue, it just was that airlines last ever flight on that route (they're bankrupt), and the pilot wanted to give a nice gooodbye.</p>

<p>Now, of course comment-sections on news regarding this are full of ""experts"" saying if it was ok or not. Here the question for the ACTUAL experts I can reach:<br>
Did the pilot do anything ""bad"" or even dangerous, or should a quick circling of the airport be just fine as long as the pilot can actually, well, fly his airplane properly?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
The Bundesaufsichtsamt für Flugsicherung (BAF) (German bureau for flight-safety) agrees with this page, the manoeuvre was ruled to have been legal and safe.</p>
","<p><strong>The maneuver was safe.</strong></p>

<p>A spokesperson of the DFS (German Air Traffic Control) told the Berliner Morgenpost that the pilot requested and was given clearance to fly a left curve in case of a go-around. The necessary distance to other aircraft was ensured and a specific height for the maneuver was not determined.</p>

<p>The spokesperson also said that the DFS believes that this maneuver was safe.</p>

<p>However the LBA (Federal Aviation Office) started examining the case and requested Air Berlin to submit a statement which provides a reason for the go-around. The editorial staff of that newspaper believes this to be a routine procedure.</p>

<p>A rough translation of the relevant part in english:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christian Hoppe, spokesperson of the German Air Traffic Control confirmed that: ""The pilot previously requested if he is allowed to fly a left-curve in case of a go-around and was given clearance."" The necessary distance to other aircraft was ensured, the specific height of the maneuver was not determined. ""From the DSF's point of view the maneuver was safe."" The Federal Office for Air Navigation corrected earlier information, which claimed that the pilot had reported problems with the landing-gear. ""That was our assumption.""</p>
  
  <p>The Federal Aviation Office will nonetheless examine the case, Air Berlin should submit a statement on the reason of the go-around. Our editorial staff believes, after multiple requests, that this is most likely routine operation.</p>

"How does a coaxial rotor helicopter achieve yaw?","5283","","<p>Without a tail rotor, how does a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_rotors"" rel=""noreferrer"">coaxial rotor helicopter</a> achieve yaw control? Does a coax have to bank in order to turn?</p>

<p>The link goes to wikipedia's article, and down a ways it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rotational maneuvering, yaw control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other. This causes a controlled dissymmetry of torque.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I cannot understand what it's saying. AFAIK both rotors always spin at the same RPM because the mechanical engine links are built that way and it's set in stone (correct me if I'm wrong). So I can't see how one rotor makes more torque.</p>

<p>EDIT: related, is this kind of yaw, however it's achieved, slower or faster than yawing in a conventional tail helicopter?</p>
","<p>In a conventional helicopter the lift generated by the rotor is controlled by the collective pitch. Raising the collective pitch increases the Angle of Attack of the the rotor blades and consequently the lift, and inevitably increases drag. The drag is overcome by increasing the <em>torque</em> from the engine. Vertical movement is achieved by balancing the collective pitch against the torque while <em>maintaining a relatively constant rotor speed</em>.</p>

<p>The torque from the engine pushing the rotor one way results in a tendency of the fuselage to rotate in the opposite direction. This is conventionally countered by a tail rotor or other similar device, and varying the force generated by this rotor controls the yaw.</p>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>In a helicopter with coaxial rotors there is no tail rotor, but the torque issue remains. Here, it's resolved by applying equal but opposite torque to each rotor.</p>

<p>Lift overall is controlled by changing the Angle of Attack of both rotors. If the same inputs are applied to both rotors then the torque remains balanced.</p>

<p>However, the Angle of Attack of one rotor can be increased while that Angle of Attack of the second is decreased, leaving lift overall unchanged. This will increase the drag on the first rotor, and hence the torque required to maintain rotor speed.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the lift, drag and torque on the second rotor has been reduced, producing an imbalance in the direction of torque between the two rotors, and a consequent yaw moment around the axis of rotation.</p>

<p>All this can be achieved without a significant change in rotor speed. In fact, the exact rotor speed doesn't play a part in yaw control.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of a pulsejet?","5282","","<p>I've heard pulsejet powered aircraft can fly at very fast speeds but are there any drawbacks to this type of engine? And are the disadvantages greater than the advantages or vice versa? </p>
","<p>The pulse jet engine works because it uses the dynamic pressure of air for compression. Consequently, it needs speed to work well. If the pulse jet is on the ground, it is not easy to start - it needs to be fed with compressed air, and once it runs (it can run even when not moving because the oscillating pressure wave inside the tube will compress the inflowing air), it develops litte thrust.</p>

<p>Thrust will go up with airspeed, so you need additional thrust sources for initial acceleration and take-off. In case of the V-1, this was done by a steam catapult or by air-launching the device. Note that the V-1 was accelerated to 370 km/h on a 45 m long catapult which means more than 100 m/s² (10g) average acceleration. Most of the development work went into making the airframe withstand this acceleration. A modern design would need additional engines as well, and once those are included, the rationale for pulse jets becomes very weak. They make sense if you have an air-launched, disposable application, such as long-range air-to-air missiles. This is a niche in which their higher-speed cousins, the ramjets, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_(missile)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">will still be used</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Very easy to build, very light.</li>
<li>Runs and produces some thrust when at rest (as opposed to ramjets). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Thrust grows with flight speed. This can be seen as a pro, but normally requires additional means of acceleration. Therefore listed as contra here.</li>
<li>Low fuel efficiency. The fuel energy is converted to other forms of energy: Just listen to the videos of <a href=""http://www.colinfurze.com/big-pulse-jet-project.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Colin Furze</a> to get an idea.</li>
<li>High levels of vibration due to the intermittent operation. When the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_280"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heinkel 280</a> was tried out with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_As_014"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Argus pulsejets</a>, the aircraft experienced unacceptable vibration.</li>
<li>Need heat-resistant materials. The central part will get very hot in operation, so at least nickel-chrome stainless steel is needed if air cooling is insufficient.</li>
<li>Cannot go supersonic. For this, there are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramjet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ramjets</a>.</li>

<li>It makes for straight path for the controls to reach the engines, as all of these are fly by cable. Many of these aircraft where also designed for harsh climates, so I imagine it's an advantage to have less pulleys and other things which might rust and require maintenance. </li>
<li>There is very little space to place the throttles further down, especially with the control column mounted on the DHC6 Twin Otter where it is. If you did want a pedestal, you'd have to seperate the control columns, requiring further mechanical components, and you'd have to route the engine cables upwards, both of which would be undesirable.</li>

  <p><strong>How realistic is Google Earth Flight Simulator?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is very <strong>unrealistic</strong> in most respects.</p>

<p>I believe there are a number of important ways you can measure realism from a pilot's perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>view out the windows</li>
<li>appearance of instrument panel</li>
<li>mode of operation of pilot aids like autopilot, autothrottle</li>
<li>flying controls

<ul>
<li>physical character</li>
<li>responsiveness</li>
</ul></li>
<li>interaction with ATC </li>
<li>effects of wind, weather, turbulence, rain, ice</li>
<li>aeronautical characteristics of aircraft</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be easy to focus solely on the last of these, but from my perspective this is not really the most important. </p>

<p>Here's a few dissimilarities that occur to me.</p>

<h2>View</h2>

<p>The SR22 doesn't have a HUD.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the SR22 cockpit windows would take up a much greater area of my vision than my computer screen does. Especially peripheral vision. Also in a real SR22, there is important stuff to look at below the windows.</p>

<h2>Instruments</h2>

<p>Do these look alike?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XEup.png"" alt=""Actual SR22 cockpit"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBk4r.png"" alt=""SR22 PFD"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QuCC3.jpg"" alt=""Google Earth SR22""></p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>In Google Earth you don't have anything like the range of controls that have to be used, where are all the switches, knobs and other dohickeys you find in the real SR22?</p>

<p>Waving a mouse around is <strong>nothing like</strong> moving a control column around. With a control column you have a much different sense of the position of the controls. Moving a mouse involves completely different muscles and different motions.</p>

<p>Moving a throttle lever is completely different to pressing PgUp and PgDn buttons to move a throttle position in increments</p>

<h2>Feel</h2>

<p>In Google Earth you don't hear any engine, you dont feel any vibration, you don't feel any turbulence, you don't feel anything in an uncoordinated turn or when pulling out of a dive, you don't feel the unevenness of a runway.</p>

<p>It's hard to really feel oriented in a simulator when your sense of balance and peripheral vision tell you you are sitting upright at your desk, not inverted and spinning towards the ground.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I'm not a pilot, I have sat in the pilot's seat of a small Cessna and manipulated the control-column and rudder to make a few turns and attempt to maintain speed and altitude under the direction of a pilot. I've done the same in a glider, and I have done some take-offs and landings in a fairly amazing full (though static) commercial 737 simulator with full cockpit reproduction (all seats, panels, motorised levers, switches etc that you'd find in a real 737 cockpit, wired to a large rack of computers).</p>

"Why were there pneumatic headphones on airliners in the 70's and 80's?","5273","","<p>I remember listening to the on-board program with headphones that consisted of hollow hoses as a kid. You plugged them into small holes in the arm-rests. The program was the same for everybody.</p>

<p>Why was the system in place? Why was it phased out?</p>
","<p>Well, the rubber hoses themselves were used instead of traditional electromag transducer headphones for two main reasons; first, the hoses were much cheaper than a decent pair of traditional headphones at the time, and to an extent they're washable, so airlines could provide a pair for everyone at a much lower pricepoint than traditional headphones. Second, the hoses were more or less useless without the driving system aboard the aircraft, largely removing the incentive for passengers to walk off with them, again reducing costs of providing the system to passengers. The system was phased out in favor of simple 1/8"" stereo jacks at each seat in the '80s and '90s as portable audio became mainstream, and as airlines looked to dramatically slash costs in the face of deregulation beginning in 1978. Economies of scale meant that buying cheapo Walkman-style headphones in bulk became cheaper than maintaining the aging pneumatic systems, and the electric-based system was more reliable and had several advantages (such as volume control for each passenger, and if standard 1/8"" jacks were used, the ability for a savvy flyer to bring their own, nicer pair for use on the flight).</p>

<p>As an aside, this pneumatic audio system is still used today for a very different purpose; newborn hearing screenings. A pair of flaps with a mild adhesive are stuck to baby's ears, then hoses lead back to a finely-calibrated audio system coupled to an EEG. Audio is played and the EEG is monitored to detect the response to the sound in baby's brain. The hose system is used because it allows the expensive, fine-tolerance part of the audio system to be reused from test to test, while the hoses themselves are disposable and (as hospital equipment goes) fairly inexpensive.</p>

<p>Modern <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_seat#Zero-zero_ejection_seat"">zero-zero ejection seats</a> are designed to be usable at zero speed, zero altitude.</p>

<p>Older ejection seats had different minimums which varied from model to model.</p>

<p>On a side note, the early F-104 ejection seats required quite a bit of altitude to deploy properly, since the pilot exited through the bottom of the aircraft. This was done because there was some concern that the pilot would hit the F-104's T-tail with a standard ejection seat.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

"Why does a plane shake while passing through clouds?","5255","","<p>Why does a plane shake while passing through the clouds?</p>

<p>During my last journey all the other passengers started shouting when the plane was passing through clouds. It was the third time I was travelling by plane and was a fearful experience. Can someone explain what the reason is for the shaking? So the next time I can travel free of fear.</p>
","<p>In a word, it's called ""Turbulence"" and in cloud, it is caused by differing air density.</p>

<p>Sciencey bit: The sun warms the earth and causes the air to rise. As warm air rises, it cools at the <em>wet adiabatic lapse rate</em>. Inside of a cloud, this rate is much slower than outside of it. Clouds are more dense than dry air, and the water vapour inside a cloud is not spread out evenly. Combined with the thermal turbulence (the movement of warm air) and the lower wet adiabatic lapse rate (rate of cooling) results in drafts of air through the cloud. </p>

<p>The result to the aircraft is pockets of more and less lift on the wings in somewhat unpredictable patterns. You feel this inside the aircraft as bumpiness and occasional feelings of rising or dropping. Sometimes this can be quite pronounced - this is why you will almost certainly be asked to remain seated with seatbelts fastened.</p>

<p>Very occasionally, outside of clouds, there can be more unpredicatable turbulence which may come as a surprise to the Pilot. This type of turbulence can cause injuries - usually from falling luggage or persons. This is why, even during cruise, the cabin crew and pilot usually suggest you keep your belt on while seated.</p>

<p>In almost no case does any kind of turbulence cause any damage to the aircraft or significantly affect its airworthiness.</p>

  <p>NOTE: See Special Notices — District of Columbia Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that there are special restrictions for flying into DCA, but where is this ""Special Notice"" that they are referring to, and how can I get permission to fly into DCA under Part 91?</p>
","<p>The ""special notices"" are a section of the <a href=""http://aeronav.faa.gov/afd/06FEB2014/NE_rear_06FEB2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">A/FD</a>, but those notices paint a very incomplete picture. Both the FAA and the TSA have requirements regarding DCA. The very basics are that you must get authorization from both the FAA and TSA 24 hours in advance, you must have an armed security officer, and you must depart from a <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf/Intermodal/dassp_gatewaylist_3-21-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">gateway airport</a>.</p>

<p>The details are, well...</p>

<h2>FAA Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li>Regulations require an arrival/departure slot to be reserved via the <a href=""https://www.fly.faa.gov/ecvrs/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">e-CVRS</a> system during most hours, just like other airports designated as high-density airports.</li>
<li>Flights to DCA must originate from within a 1250 mile perimeter (with limited exceptions).</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>TSA requirements</h2>

<p>The TSA requirements are referred to as the DCA Access Standard Security Program (DASSP). An overview is given on this <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/stakeholders/security-programs-and-initiatives"" rel=""nofollow"">tsa.gov page</a> (scroll down to ""DCA Access Standard Security Program"").</p>

<p>Details can be found in the <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf/Intermodal/inerim_final_rule_v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Interim Final Rule</a>... because calling the ruling both <em>interim</em> and <em>final</em> won't confuse anyone. Here is a summarization of that document:</p>

<h3>Section A. Aircraft Operator Requirements:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Security Coordinators</strong> The aircraft operator (company) must have a designated security coordinator who is the point of contact for the TSA and is responsible for implementing the DASSP requirements. This person must undergo a TSA security threat assessment, and a fingerprint-based criminal history records check (CHRC) by the FBI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DCA Access Standard Security Program (DASSP)</strong> TSA will verify the operator's status with the FAA before sending the DASSP document which contains ""sensitive security information"" which must be implemented, and the operator must notify TSA when all requirements have been implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flightcrew Members</strong> Each flight crew member (does not include flight attendants) must undergo a fingerprint-based CHRC and an FAA record check. Almost any prior restricted airspace violation is an immediate disqualifier.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flight Approvals</strong> Each flight into or out of DCA requires a tentative slot reservation from the FAA (see FAA reqirement #1 above) before applying for TSA authorization. The TSA application must be submitted at least 24 hours prior to aircraft departure. If TSA approves the application, they will transmit this to the FAA which will issue the final slot reservation, and TSA will notify the operator. The <strong>TSA only approves up to 48 applications</strong> for a given date. The application must include (once per round-trip):</p>

<ul>
<li>The name, address, and citizen status of each passenger and crewmember (includes flight attendants).</li>
<li>The registration number of the aircraft.</li>
<li>The flight plan.</li>
<li>and... ""any other information required by TSA.""</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating Requirements</strong> Each flight must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be operated under instrument flight rules.</li>
<li>not make any intermediate stops between the designated gateway airport and DCA.</li>
<li>have the aircraft, crew, passengers, and property inspected by TSA prior to departure. </li>
<li>have the cockpit door closed and locked for the duration of the flight (if equipped).</li>
<li>have at least one armed security officer who meets the armed security officer requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Costs</strong> TSA charges \$15 for each crew member and passenger to conduct the security threat assessment. Additionally, they charge for the screening services at the airport which are ""currently estimated at \$296 per round trip into and out of DCA.""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protection of Sensitive Security Infonnation</strong> The specific security details described in the DASSP must only be shared on a need-to-know basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Security Procedures</strong> This paragraph basically says TSA can make you do whatever they want... as if that wasn't obvious by this point in the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance</strong> TSA can perform any inspection or test it wants to verify the operators compliance with DASSP.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Section B. Fixed Base Operator Requirements</h3>

<p><em>That's right, there are two section B's, one right after the other... in case you weren't already convinced the TSA has strong attention to detail.</em></p>

<p>This section just says there are FBO requirements for gateway airports. Here is a list of <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf/Intermodal/dassp_gatewaylist_3-21-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Gateway Airports</a> dated March 21, 2013. The list is always subject to change and seems to have more to do with whether there is an FBO at the airport who wants to put up the DASSP more than anything else.</p>

<h3>Section C. Armed Security Officer Requirements</h3>

<p>Armed security officers must be an active or retired law enforcement officer, or an individual approved by the TSA. This requires a similar background check as the security coordinator and law enforcement training which TSA finds acceptable. For more information, see the <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/about-tsa/armed-security-officer-aso-program"" rel=""nofollow"">Armed Security Officer (ASO) Program</a>.</p>

<h3>Flying under Part 91?</h3>

<p>At first glance it doesn't seem like there is any rule explicitly prohibiting Part 91 operations in <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5e655959da7dab4ee420e2f5192708b4&amp;node=49:9.1.3.5.11&amp;rgn=div5"" rel=""nofollow"">49 CFR Part 1544</a>, and <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5e655959da7dab4ee420e2f5192708b4&amp;node=49:9.1.3.5.11&amp;rgn=div5#49:9.1.3.5.11.1.10.1"" rel=""nofollow"">§1544.1 Applicability of this part.</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) This part prescribes aviation security rules governing the following:</p>
  
  <p>(1) The operations of aircraft operators holding operating certificates under 14 CFR part 119 for scheduled passenger operations, public charter passenger operations, private charter passenger operations; the operations of aircraft operators holding operating certificates under 14 CFR part 119 operating aircraft with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or more; <strong>and other aircraft operators adopting and obtaining approval of an aircraft operator security program.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general definition of an <em>aircraft operator</em> is not limited to an operator with a Part 119 operating certificate. <strong>However, the possibility of using part 91 seems to be ruled out</strong> by <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5e655959da7dab4ee420e2f5192708b4&amp;node=49:9.1.3.5.11&amp;rgn=div5#49:9.1.3.5.11.2.10.1"" rel=""nofollow"">§1544.101 Adoption and implementation.</a> where it enumerates the scenarios TSA is willing to approve, and there are no Part 91 operations in the list.</p>

<p>There are probably a few reasons why Part 91 is not allowed. Most notably:</p>

<ul>
<li>TSA has specific aircraft operator requirements which an individual operator is unlikely to be able to comply with, and</li>
<li>There are only 48 slots available per day, and therefore preference is given to commercial operators - the explicitly given explanation for why non-airline flights are permitted at all is to permit ""operators, their customers, and affected local businesses to recover from the adverse economic impacts brought on by the events of September 11, 2001.""</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other fun quotes:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>TSA may, at its discretion, require any flight into or out of DCA under this subpart to comply with additional security measures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, if TSA or the FAMS requires that the aircraft have one or more Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) on board, the aircraft operator must allow the FAM(s) onboard, at no cost to the Federal Government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TSA may, at its discretion, <strong>cancel any or all flight approvals at any time</strong> without prior notice to the aircraft operator. For example, if the threat level in the Washington, D.C., area or in the vicinity of any of the gateway airports is set at ORANGE or RED, TSA is likely to cancel any and all flight approvals into and out of DCA.</p>

"For airplane spotting, what minimum specs should a telescope have?","5248","","<p>We are thinking about buying a telescope for viewing planets, stars, the moon, and aircraft! What is the absolute minimum zoom and/or size to achieve getting a good glimpse of an aircraft at its cruising altitude?</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience doing this that they could share to help us out?</p>
","<p>I would not recommend a telescope for viewing aircraft.<br>
As others have pointed out, a telescope that is suitable for astronomy would be <em>incredibly</em> overpowered for viewing aircraft - the aircraft would move out of the viewing frame very quickly, and you would have a difficult time tracking them.</p>

<p>I would suggest picking up a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/b?node=3168061"">spotting scope</a> (the kind of thing bird watchers and hunters use - good ones can be had in the 50 to 100 dollar price range, and excellent ones abound from about $100 up), or a pair of good binoculars for your plane watching. The zoom factor is far better suited to plane spotting, and either option would be substantially more portable than a full telescope rig.</p>

<p>As for advice on a telescope, there is an Astronomy stack exchange site, and while <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">the entire network generally doesn't do ""product recommendations""</a> the Astronomy site's <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/"">chat</a> might be a good place to ask for advice on picking a telescope.

"What is the difference between CAN and ARINC?","5245","","<p>I want to know the difference between CAN and ARINC, I'm confused about their usage.</p>

<p>For example, the communication between the cockpit and the controllers is done using ARINC protocols. And the data transmitted by probes to the controllers goes over CAN. Why use a different protocol in each case? When is each protocol used?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>the communication between the cockpit and the controllers is done by using Arinc protocols. And the data transmitted by probes to the controllers is done by CAN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends very much on the aircraft type. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And when can we use each one of them (Arinc and CAN)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you design your own aircraft you get to choose.</p>

<hr>

<p>CAN stands for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus"">Controller Area Network</a>. CAN is a bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. It has its origins in the automotive industry. </p>

<p>ARINC stands for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC"">Aeronautical Radio</a>, Incorporated. ARINC is an organisation that amongst other activities produces technical standards for avionics and provides services to aircraft operators. </p>

<p>Amongst the ARINC standards there are a number addressing data communications between avionics components. Most widely used is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429"">ARINC 429</a> standard which describes an avionics data bus. ARINC 429 allows a single transmitter to communicate data to up to 20 receivers over a single bus. </p>

<p>Comparing CAN bus to ARINC 429:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cable

<ul>
<li>CAN: STP or UPT, possible to implement on fiberoptic cable</li>
<li>ARINC 429: STP</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Speed

<ul>
<li>CAN: 1 Mbit/s (high speed) / 125 Kbit/s (low speed)</li>
<li>ARINC 429 100Kbit/s (high speed) / 10-14 Kbit/s (low speed)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Directionality

<ul>
<li>CAN: bi-directional, connected units can send and receive on the same cable. </li>
<li>ARINC 429: uni-directional, a unit either transmits or receives from a cable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Number of units on a single bus

<ul>
<li>CAN: unlimited, although in practice no more than about 32 units will be sharing a bus to avoid data collisions.</li>
<li>ARINC 429: one transmitter can serve at most 20 receiving units on a single cable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Since ARINC 429 has only a single transmitter, timely data arrival is guaranteed, while CAN has to incorporate transmission collision detection &amp; correction which incurs non deterministic time overhead. </p>

<p>On the other hand, ARINC 429 only uses a parity bit for bit level error detection whilst CAN allows for various methods including CRC checks</p>

<p>Some of this data is obtained from an article on CAN bus in <a href=""http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/feature/CAN-Bus-in-Aviation_31468.html#.ViKwKZekU_s"">avionics magazine</a>. </p>

<p>Newer ARINC busses like 629 or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics_Full-Duplex_Switched_Ethernet"">664 (AFDX)</a> allow for higher speeds and bi-directional communication. These may eventually replace ARINC 429 (but never underestimate how slow progress in aviation is)</p>

<p>Considering all the other parameters are good enough (no crosswind, long runway, aircraft light enough,...) and the pilots are aware of this unusual takeoff configuration and adapt their action accordingly (including increasing $V_r$ and $V_2$), is it possible for any passenger jet to takeoff and stay airborn (not like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanair_Flight_5022"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flight spanair 5022</a>) without extending flaps?</p>
","<p>Yes take-off without flaps is possible. The Airbus A300 and Boeing 767 are approved for such take-offs and it is being done regularly. It results in a better climb gradient, especially with one engine out. The one engine out climb gradient is an important and sometimes limiting factor in take-off calculations. </p>

<p>One important constraint is the length of the runway.</p>

<p>Another limitation, perhaps less obvious, is the maximum rolling speed of the wheels. The tires are rated to a limited speed which may be exceeded by a flap-less take-off.</p>

"What are the security measures preventing someone from chartering a 747 and using it to commit a terrorist attack?","5236","","<p>While most travelers are well familiar with the security measures imposed by conventional airlines, it is unclear how they apply to private aircraft.</p>

<p>Is it possible for a private individual to charter a 747 for private uses? And if so, are there any security measures in place to prevent said private individual from misusing the aircraft?</p>

<p>(hopefully this question won't get me on the no-fly list) :)</p>
","<p>Yes!  You can charter large aircraft like the 747.  A lot of airlines offer this service for large groups (sports teams come to mind), and there are also operators of the Boeing Business Jet that were created just for private and charter uses.</p>

<p>The TSA requires aircraft like this to adopt a security program called the Twelve-Five Standard Security Program (or TFSSP for short).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=09058d33263a3e3444c6cde4f3b25e8f&amp;node=49:9.1.3.5.11&amp;rgn=div5"">49 CFR Part 1544</a> contains the regulations which cover this.</p>

<p>Most of the security program falls under non-disclosure rules that prevent anyone with knowledge of the program from talking about it to people that don't have an operational need to know (and have also signed a non-disclosure).  This helps to prevent people that would try to bypass the security measures in place from even knowing what to look for.</p>

<p>The regulations do specify the following though:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each operator of an aircraft that weighs more than 12,500 lbs. that is used for scheduled or charter operations must adopt the program.</li>
<li>The program must be approved by the TSA.</li>
<li>The program must contain the procedures and description of the facilities and equipment used regarding:
<ul>
<li>the acceptance and screening of individuals and their accessible property, including, if applicable, the carriage weapons as part of State-required emergency equipment,</li>
<li>the acceptance and screening of checked baggage,</li>
<li>the acceptance and screening of cargo,</li>
<li>the screening of individuals and property,</li>
<li>the use of metal detection devices,</li>
<li>regarding the use of x-ray systems,</li>
<li>the use of explosives detection systems,</li>
<li>the responsibilities of security coordinators,</li>
<li>the requirements for law enforcement personnel,</li>
<li>carriage of accessible weapons,</li>
<li>carriage of prisoners under the control of armed law enforcement officers,</li>
<li>transportation of Federal Air Marshals,</li>
<li>aircraft and facilities control function,</li>
<li>the specific locations where the air carrier has entered into an exclusive area agreement,</li>
<li>fingerprint-based criminal history records checks,</li>
<li>personnel identification systems,</li>
<li>training,</li>
<li>an aviation security contingency plan,</li>
<li>bomb and air piracy threats,</li>
<li>flight deck privileges, and</li>
<li>the Aircraft Operator Implementation Plan (AOIP).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a bit that goes into the TFSSP.  Two of the biggest things though are the requirement for all flight crew members to undergo a fingerprint based criminal background check and that access to the flight deck must be restricted.</p>

<p>Requirements for Instrument Rating in the United States are listed in section 61.65 of the Federal Aviation Regulation[2] are:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 hours of Pilot in Command cross country </li>
<li>40 hours of simulated or
actual instrument time </li>
<li>15 hours of flight instruction towards
Instrument Rating</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this mean that 40 hours could be done on a simulator alone or does that overlap with the 15 hours with the instructor?</p>
","<p>The short answer: It depends.  Either 10, 20 or 30 hours of simulator/FTD/ATD time may be used, but all of it must be with an approved instructor.  None of it may be solo.</p>

<p>None of the requirements you posted are related to simulator time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>50 hours of Pilot in Command cross country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be done solo, as you are a rated pilot and thus PIC.  This need not be solo XC and can be done with a passenger or CFI.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>40 hours of simulated or actual instrument time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this quote, simulated instrument time refers to time spent in the airplane during flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) that you are wearing a view-limiting device to simulate IMC.  While wearing a view-limiting device you <strong>must</strong> be accompanied by another pilot who acts as your safety pilot.  Thus, none of this time may be accomplished solo.  You will always need another pilot either in simulated or actual instrument conditions.</p>

"Why is the Boeing 747-300 not in service anymore?","5220","","<p>Doing a little doodling on flightradar24.com and Wikipedia, I saw that all the versions on the Boeing 747 except for the -300 version are used. Why is the Boeing 747-300 not used even though it is newer than the -100, -200, and SP versions?</p>
","<p>The 747-300 was somewhat of a cross between -200 and SP. The -300 was almost same as the -200 except for the increased length of the hump. The -300 was never a success and was soon overshadowed by the -400. </p>

<p>The 747SP was the result of a requirement for longer range aircraft. Boeing engineers basically <a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/how-things-work/how-the-747-got-its-hump-4578877/?no-ist=&amp;page=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cut around 47' from the 747 fuselage in SP</a>. However, by the time it flew for the first time, commercial air travel had changed (in no small part due to the high oil prices) and the model never sold as much as Boeing had hoped. However, when it was observed that there were no adverse effects when the rear of the cockpit lined up with the front of the wing, Boeing introduced the 747-300 with increased length of the hump with little else in terms of major change from -200.</p>

<p>However, just two years after -300 was introduced, Boeing introduced the -400, which was a significant improvement- it eliminated the flight engineer, increased range among others, while retaining the -300's hump (which meant more economy seats). 747-400 is the most successful model of the series, with more than 690 orders. Most airlines jumped straight to the -400, effectively killing the -300.</p>

<p>Actually, the 747-200 production (with over 390 made) ended <em>after</em> the -300 version (of which only 81 were made). So they are more of contemporaries. </p>

<p>Also, it'll be a stretch to call that the older 747 versions are still in passenger service. 747-100 is <a href=""http://worldairlinenews.com/2014/01/09/iranair-retires-the-last-passenger-boeing-747-100-after-almost-35-years-of-service/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not flown with passengers anymore</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747SP#Current_operators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">current operations of 747SP</a> hardly qualify as passenger service and the most successful of these, the 747-200s are also <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9340/how-many-747-200-are-still-in-service"">being slowly phased out</a>, if you discount the VC-25s flying around with US President (which are slated to be replaced by 747-8s).</p>

"Can I use motor oil in a aircraft piston engine?","5211","","<p>In one episode of the 'reality' show <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane_Repo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Airplane Repo</a> a pilot topped off an aircraft engine with motor oil; I think it was a Cessna 182 but I may be wrong. What would be the effect on the engine? Is it a practical (and safe) alternative if aviation oil isn't available?</p>
","<p>By motor oil, I assume that you mean <em>automotive</em> motor oil. In that case, it's a bad idea for a bunch of reasons. First, every airplane POH I've seen has specified that the oil must qualify to a standard - either MIL-L-6082 or MIL-L-22851 (though those have been superseded by an SAE standard). Modern automotive oil doesn't meet that standard, and therefore is effectively forbidden by the POH. More to the point, automotive oil is bad for aviation engines.</p>

<p>Aviation and automotive engines work on the same basic principles, but many of the details are different.<sup>1</sup> One significant difference is that aviation engines normally burn some oil as they run, while well-performing automobile engines burn little or none.</p>

<p>Automotive oil contains a number of additives, such as detergents and wear inhibitors, intended for use where the oil doesn't burn off. Some of those additives do not burn completely, but instead stick around in the form of ash, where they can foul the engine and create deposits that lead to pre-ignition. That is why aviation oil is <em>ashless</em> dispersant: it cleans the engine by dispersing combustion byproducts into the oil (to be removed on the next oil change), while being <em>ashless</em> when burned. Lycoming considers it serious enough to put in an all-caps ""CAUTION"" section in their <a href=""http://www.lycoming.com/Portals/0/techpublications/serviceinstructions/SI%201014M%20%2805-22-1995%29/Lubricating%20Oil%20Recommendations.pdf"">Lubricating Oil Recommendations</a> document: </p>

  <p>UNDER
  NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD AUTOMOTIVE OIL BE USED. THE USE OF AUTOMOTIVE
  LUBRICANTS IN TEXTRON LYCOMING ENGINES IS NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE ITS
  USE COULD CAUSE ENGINE FAILURE. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If all of that wasn't enough, use of an improper oil may void your engine warranty. In short: don't use it.</p>

"Why don't helicopters always takeoff from a hover out of ground-effect?","5205","","<p>I've read enough crash reports to see that helicopters discovering too late in takeoff that they lack the power to fly out of ground-effect is a serious problem.</p>

<p>I am wondering why the following isn't standard takeoff practice: Establish positive climb rate <em>out of ground effect</em> before beginning any translational flight.  Failure to climb out of ground effect would be cause for immediate ATO, and there would be this nice landing zone to abort into!</p>

<p>(Only in exceptional emergencies, like when a mountain takeoff gives the rotor-craft a clear glide-path into denser air, would it be reasonable to ignore this procedure.)</p>

<p>(I note that I am assuming that translational flight out of ground effect is always more demanding than hovering.  I vaguely remember that this is <em>not</em> the case, but I don't remember why, and it seems counterintuitive since translational motion always establishes a retreating blade with lower lift that then needs a higher angle-of-attack and more power to maintain lift.  So if the helicopter can't climb under full power with no translation, it would not be able to once it tries moving forward.)</p>
","<p>Forward flight is much more efficient than hovering.  As airspeed builds, lift increases from ""translational"" lift as the air moves more horizontally over the disc.  Since the relative airflow is more horizontal, the angle of attack for a given pitch angle is increased.</p>

<p>The vortices and turbulence move behind and down from the helicopter so undisturbed air is drawn over the disc to be accelerated downwards to produce lift.  Lift is more efficiently produced by accelerating a large mass by a small amount rather than a small mass by a large amount.</p>

<p>It is more efficient to remain in ground effect and slowly increase speed to gain translational lift than to increase power to HOGE (Hover Out of Ground Effect) and attempt to translate.</p>

<p>The problems you refer to are where an unwary pilot attempts to transition from HOGE whilst allowing the aircraft to climb or attempting to maintain height.  Without enough power, the loss of ground effect before the benefits of translational lift are gained will result in a rapid descent back to earth (as vortex ring state or settling with power is pretty much impossible to avoid) or you overpitch and drag the RRPM (rotor RPM) down so low that you cannot produce lift or even worse, stall the blades.</p>

<p>Bottom line, it takes more power to establish positive climb out of ground effect than to gain translational lift in ground effect.</p>

"How much does it cost the airline if an aircraft misses its take-off slot?","5201","","<p>I was recently watching a TV programme and it said if an aircraft misses its take-off slot it will cost the airline company thousands, roughly how many thousands though???</p>
","<p>A slot time is issued for aircraft flying through busy airspaces or to busy airports where the demand (number of flights) exceeds the capacity. If 50 flights are planned to arrive at an airport in 1 hour, but the airport can only handle 40 flights per hour, then the flow of traffic needs to be regulated.</p>

<p>Many years ago, everyone would simply depart, and then traffic would enter airborne holdings (circling in the air) along their route as they approached their destination, until there was room to land. Obviously, this is very inefficient, since planes would use a huge amount of fuel while waiting in the air.</p>

<p>Air traffic flow management was introduced to reduce this. Computer systems now calculate how many flights are planned to arrive at a certain airport in a certain time span. This calculation is done many hours in advance - so early, in fact, that the majority of the affected flights have not left their departure airport yet. This has the advantage that aircraft can wait on the ground, at their departure airport, soaking up the delay they will inevitable face. They will simply not be allowed to takeoff until a time where it can be assured that there is room for them when they reach their destination.</p>

<p>To achieve this, aircraft are issued a takeoff slot time (CTOT - Calculated TakeOff Time), at which time the flight must depart. If the flight misses this slot time, for one reason or the other, they are not allowed to depart - instead, they must request a new slot time. If flying to a very busy airport, the new slot time could be far in the future - sometimes several hours. This means that the plane must hold on the departure airport for several hours before being able to depart.</p>

<p>How these CTOT times are calculated is very complex, and deserves another question if you are interested.</p>

<p>While there are no direct costs from missing a slot time, getting delayed will cause many indirect costs for an airline - passenger compensation for delayed and missed flights, extra pay for crew (on the plane and at the airports) and so on. So the ""thousands"" it may cost an airline to miss a slot time come from these indirect costs of being delayed. Obviously, the exact amount will vary greatly from flight to flight.</p>

"Is there a maximum lift to drag ratio?","5185","","<p>If I recall correctly, the best competition gliders have a L/D ratio as high as 60:1. What imposes this limit? Is there a maximum theoretical L/D ratio, or could sufficiently advanced materials allow a glider with a L/D ratio of, say, 200:1?</p>
","<p>With current technology the L/D might go up to 70 or 75, and going higher would require an almost impractically large wing span. Gliders need to fly in tight circles to use updrafts, and the larger the wingspan becomes, the bigger the speed difference between inner and outer wing will be. Also, landing such a wide wing without dropping a wingtip will be very hard. Smaller wings with a high aspect ratio will have a low chord length, leading to smaller <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number"" rel=""nofollow"">Reynolds number</a>s, which translates into a steep increase of friction drag if the aspect ratio is increased without increasing wing area. Therefore, only adding wing span will help, and this runs into a soft wall beyond the 30 m of designs like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_(glider)"" rel=""nofollow"">Eta</a>. In addition, the current <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_competition_classes"" rel=""nofollow"">mass limit of 850 kg</a> will make bigger aircraft unattractive for competition pilots.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://lesgpr.free.fr/construire/concordia/ConcImagine_WV_e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Concordia (pdf!)</a> is claimed to have an L/D approaching 75, but I have learned over the years to see theoretical predictions as invariably optimistic, and realistic performance, with bugs on the wing and all, will never quite measure up to the hoped-for ideal. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88792main_Laminar.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Werner Pfenniger proposed to use boundary layer laminarisation by suction (pdf!)</a> to reduce friction drag and proposed glider designs with L/D ratios in excess of 100. Turbines at the wingtips would drive the suction pumps, so these would still be unpowered aircraft. But so far nobody has dared to turn his visions into reality.</p>

<p>While laminarisation avoids the increase in friction drag of a turbulent boundary layer, a moving wall would eliminate viscous losses altogether. Now the friction generation is between the moving wall (this could be a taut foil running between two cylinders at the forward and aft end of the wing) and the fixed structure. With current materials there is no hope of reducing drag this way, but who knows what tricks will be possible in the future.</p>

<p>A glide ratio of 100 or more looks rather unlikely in the next 50 years.</p>

"How do you determine the proper rate of descent for landing?","5168","","<p>I'm trying to use a simulator to learn to land properly.  One part that I'm finding really tricky is picking a proper rate of descent.  I know I'm supposed to do my best to keep it so I have two red lights and two white lights on the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI), but at the moment I basically am just eyeballing it and adjusting my course whenever the lights aren't right.</p>

<p>I have to assume, though, that for any given airspeed there is a rate of descent I can maintain that will keep me right in the middle of the preferred glide slope for that airport.  I just have no idea how to figure it out.  Is there an application or formula that is preferred for this?  Or is it time to learn Vector Calculus?</p>

<p>PS- I did check <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/1971/descent-planning"">this</a> question to see if it related.  But that question is about starting the descent from cruise.  I'm talking about rate of descent for final. I did also check <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/5086/how-to-get-the-correct-angle-when-doing-a-visual-appoach-before-landing"">this</a> answer, but it's about using the PAPI/VASI lights.  I'm looking for a formula to figure out the proper rate of descent during final for a given speed.</p>
","<p>Assuming you want a 3 degree glide slope, just take 5 times your ground speed in knots as a starting point. </p>

<p>As an example, approaching at 90kt ground speed in a light aircraft, go for 450feet per minute. at 140kt in a jet, try 700fpm. If you're flying a jet outside of 4 miles, and the controller wants you to keep the speed up at 200kt then descend 1000fpm.</p>

<p>It's not perfect, but it works pretty well for a first guess, and you can adjust as necessary.</p>

<p>Of course, your ground speed is not the same as your air speed, and even for a constant IAS it will likely vary as you descend and the wind changes. Another way to think about this is that a 3 degree glideslope is almost exactly 300ft per nautical mile. If you're 2 miles out and 700 feet up, then you need to descend a bit faster, conversely, if you're at 500 feet, you need to descend slower.</p>

<p>A third related rule of thumb is that your final approach speed (in CAS, although IAS is good enough in most aircraft) is 1.3 times your stall speed in the landing configuration (Vso). So if you stall at 100 knots, you want to approach at 130KIAS.</p>

<p>IFR approaches are all about having an initial guess at these numbers in your head, trying them out, and then adjusting as the conditions require. If you're good at the guesses then the adjustments will be very small.</p>

"How is combustion flame maintained in the combustion chamber after igniters are switched off?","5166","","<p>During start phase of a jet engine, igniters in the combustion chamber create sparks to initiate combustion.  As far I know, when the engine reaches self sustaining speed, igniters get turned off (this might be different (takes longer) in an Airliner due to FAA regulations during take off).</p>

<p>My question is how do flames in the combustion chamber (or canisters) get sustained (like a candle) without igniters support?</p>
","<p>Another answer to add to caseys:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flow speed near the fuel injectors is very slow, on the order of 30 m/s. This is caused by a widening of the flow path between compressor exit and combustor called a diffusor or diffuser. See <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/11744/why-do-gases-in-the-combustion-chamber-only-flow-on-direction-to-the-gas-turbine/11752#11752"">here</a> for more.</li>
<li>Radiation from the burning fuel-air mixture in the middle part of the combustor heats up the not-yet-burning mixture near the fuel injectors, which helps the fuel droplets to evaporate (this is a necessary step before combustion can start) and causes the mixture to be heated above its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoignition_temperature"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">autoignition temperature</a>. Hence, this radiated heat will provide the fuel-air mixture with the needed activation energy for combustion. </li>
</ol>

<p>Some combustors have small notches in their wall which create local turbulence and help to keep some of the burning fuel-air-mixture back, which helps to start ignition in the following flow. These are called flame holders.</p>

<p>If all of the burning gas is washed out from the combustion chamber without igniting the following gas, the ignition process will stop. This is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flameout"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flame-out</a>. The heat from the walls of the combustion chamber will not be enough to re-ignite the fuel-air mixture, because they are cooled by the airflow from the compressor and will rapidly cool down once the flame is blown out.</p>

"What makes it so hard to land on an aircraft carrier?","5147","","<p>I have heard it is very difficult for a pilot to land on a carrier deck.  </p>

<p>I <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/475/aircraft-carrier-landing"">have read this question</a> but it didn't really give me a sense of the challenges that pilots face.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/827/57"">This question lent me the insight</a> that <strong><em>metal decks</em></strong>, themselves, have different properties (that I should have considered)... perhaps friction, changes due to thermal shifts (that asphalt does not exhibit), perhaps it 'gives' differently under touch-down pressure.</p>

<p>Can someone paint a more-complete picture?  I'm sure there are also other factors, besides that the deck is moving.... but even then - perhaps there are 'different kinds' of movements of the deck that I haven't considered.</p>
","<p>I've never done it IRL, but read about it lots, and Flight Simmed it many times, so I'll take a stab.<br>(<em>until someone who has actually done it says better</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Glide Path</strong><br>
When landing on a fixed runway, your glide-path is pretty much right towards the end of the runway.<br>Its not like that at all on a Carrier.  From up high, you are actually aiming for a point <em>in front</em> of the carrier.  You're aiming for where the runway <em>will be</em> in 30 seconds.   As you get closer, the carrier moves closer into position.  But still not entirely in position until the last second.   So you're always aiming for an invisible/imaginary point where the runway will be at the last second.
<p>This is the best picture I've found of what I'm describing:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tf6tN.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tf6tNm.jpg"" alt=""Carrier landing""></a><br>
Notice that the flight path indicator (the little circle in the HUD) is well beyond the front of the carrier.  If this plane was landing on a runway, the flight path would be aimed right at the numbers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Flare</strong><br>
In a typical runway landing you flare out just before touchdown, ""float"" for a second and drop on to the runway.<br>In a carrier landing, you maintain your glide-path attitude all the way on to the deck.   There's no flare or float. This helps you hit exactly the spot you're aiming for (the 3-wire), but in some sense you really are crashing into the deck at a not-inconsiderable descent rate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pitching Deck</strong><br>
Remember the glide path to the imaginary touch-down point?  Because the carrier deck can be pitching or rolling in the waves, that imaginary touch-down point is not a fixed distance directly in front of the ship.  As the ship bobs and weaves around, your touchdown point is moving around too.   That makes it even harder to hit the point right.  It can well be at the last second, as your plane is dropping quickly, the deck suddenly jumps up to meet you, making the impact even more violent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sideways Movement</strong><br>
The landing part of a carrier deck is the diagonal part on the back of the deck.   It is angled about 20-degrees to the left, relative to the carrier.  But it is moving directly forward with the movement of the carrier.  This means the ""runway"" is not moving directly away from you, but slipping sideways.   </p></li>

"Do airline transport pilot trainees ever fly a passenger-less aircraft?","5147","","<p>Do airline transport pilot (ATP) trainees ever fly an empty aircraft? Consider the example where a pilot is under training to operate a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">777</a>. Would the pilot ever fly the real aircraft without any passengers? Or is training only limited to simulation?</p>
","<p>When pilots are trained for flying in an aircraft type they have not flown in before, they go through type rating, then line training. During the type rating, they learn where all the instruments and buttons are, what starts which system, how the plane behaves, how to land and auto-land etc.</p>

<p>During line training, they spend time in the cockpit together with an instructor pilot, usually a senior captain. Most airlines have a 3-person crew in the cockpit when a new F/O is receiving line training. This training is about the airline specific bit of flying, company procedures etc.</p>

<p>Note that before going to type rating, the pilot already has at least a commercial flying license: they can fly already. Depending on the country, the type rating can take place in a Level D simulator for 100%. Some countries still require a couple of actual flights in an aircraft, but there is an increasing trend to use Level D simulators only, for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Back when the airlines paid and arranged for type ratings, it was relatively simple for them to arrange for an aircraft for a training flight, empty or not. But now a majority of type ratings is self funded, how does a student find the finance to charter an empty aircraft? </li>
<li>The realism of Level D simulators is incredible. My office used to be not far from the simulators - every once in a while I would hear the siren for the sim coming down at an unscheduled time, for an unscheduled break: the stress level inside is real, you reckon that you are really 30,000 feet up with an engine on fire, alarms sounding, actual (non-toxic) smoke entering the cockpit, etc. After clearing the emergency, some students needed time to reflect.</li>

"How are modern jets modified to takeoff/land on a dirt runway?","5145","","<p>I've been reading a lot about the Soviet and Russian military aircraft, and it seems a lot of them are built to work on dirt runways, or modified to do so.</p>

<p>How is this accomplished? Is it a simple thing to modify aircraft in this way? Is it just a matter of strengthening the undercarriage and upgrading the tires for more stress? Or is something harder involved, like maybe strengthening the fuselage frame?</p>

<p>NOTE: let's exclude worries about foreign objects going into the engines. Right now I'm only interested in the difference between paved and dirt runways as far as landing gear and strength are concerned.</p>
","<p>Just to roll around on ""unimproved"" airfields (grass/dirt/gravel strips), the biggest thing planes need is simply a decent set of tires:</p>

<p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Mig-29_on_landing.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Mig-29_on_landing.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>This MiG-29UN trainer shows off the fairly beefy main tires put on these planes specifically to allow them to more easily roll over minor imperfections in the runway/taxiway surface, including dirt/gravel/grass strips (though here it's landing on a traditional asphalt/concrete surface). Compare these to the relatively small gear wheels and low-aspect rubber on the similarly-sized F-16:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.f-16.net/g3/var/resizes/f-16-photos/album39/album32/6676.jpg?m=1371907365"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.f-16.net/g3/var/resizes/f-16-photos/album39/album32/6676.jpg?m=1371907365</a></p>

<p>Now, your question oversimplifies things, because ""foreign object debris"" or FOD is in fact a primary danger of unpaved airstrips for jets, and this danger has to be accounted for in the design. Here's the main reason the MiG-29 can take off from dirt:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c73AL.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c73AL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>MiG-29s and similarly-minded Su-27s, and their variants, have special doors to close off the lower intakes normally used in flight, instead drawing in air through the gill-like ports over the top of the wing strakes. This prevents the engine from ingesting dust, rocks, birds, rodents, etc on takeoff and landing.</p>

<p>This engine protection system, while effective, adds mechanical complexity and weight which U.S. designers and military brass have generally thought unnecessary given that requirements rarely include the ability to operate from unimproved strips. Most U.S. fighters in the jet age, therefore, have had to operate from airbases with some form of paved runway surface (and the U.S. military actually has higher standards for runway surface quality than most international airports). The U.S. arsenal does, however, have several aircraft that are specifically designed to operate from rudimentary airstrips at forward bases. These designs avoid FOD damage primarily by keeping the engines up as high as the design will allow. For instance, the A-10's two engines are on pods angled up on the fuselage between the wings and tail for a variety of reasons including FOD avoidance: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VP6no.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VP6no.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Most of the other designs in the Western arsenal that can do this are high-wing designs with wing-mounted engines, which keep them out of the dust produced by takeoff and landing in a similar fashion. Here are a C-130 and C-17 landing at an Afghanistan forward base:</p>

<p>The Harrier is a notable exception to this general strategy by Western designers of just keeping the engines out of any debris cloud.

<blockquote>
  <p>During a turn, if you reduce the airspeed and maintain the angle of bank, the result is a _____________ rate of turn. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct answer is ""higher"" which is confusing me. </p>

<ul>
<li>If I reduce the airspeed, won't it take longer to complete the turn, thus ""lower"" rate of turn? </li>
<li>I can understand that the turn might be smoother and more coordinated if I reduce the airspeed, but how can the rate of turn be higher? </li>
<li>What am I missing here?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Independent of airspeed, angle of bank gives you the ""G"" force in a level coordinated turn. A 60 degree bank = 2 G's, at any speed.</p>

<p>At low speed, a given G force will give you a greater heading change than it would at a high speed. Driving your car at 10 mph you can complete a U-turn, 180 degrees of heading change, in a couple seconds without pinning passengers against the door, but at highway speeds, even a hard turn that does impose big side-loads will take much longer to give you that much heading change.</p>

<p>Related to all this is turn <em>radius</em>: at low speed, your turn radius for any given loading (bank angle) is smaller than it would be at a higher speed with that same loading/bank angle. Thus, even though you're going slower, you have less distance (circumference of the circle) to cover, and so you are able to complete the circle (or one 360th of it) more quickly.</p>

<p>I could imagine that it might be a material problem. But are there any more reasons? And why exactly might it be a material problem? </p>
","<p>Winglets on wings help because they increase the volume of air on which the wing can act. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8556/is-a-winglet-better-than-an-equal-span-extension/8579#8579"">Extending the wing span would be much more efficient</a>, but when span is restricted or the maximum wing bending moment is limited, winglets bring a small improvement in efficiency at high lift coefficients. </p>

<p><a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8819/is-there-any-equation-to-bind-velocity-thrust-and-power/8822#8822"">On propellers</a>, however, the winglets would run through air which is already affected by the tips of the propeller. No additional air will be involved, so no efficiency increase will be possible. Please note that propulsive efficiency is increased by accelerating more air by a smaller amount. The formula for the propulsive efficiency $\eta_p$ of an air breathing engine is
$$\eta_p = \frac{v_{\infty}}{v_{\infty} + \frac{\Delta v}{2}}$$
where $v_{\infty}$ is the speed of the inflowing air and $\Delta v$ the speed increase of the air affected by the propeller disc. A smaller $\Delta v$ acting on a higher mass flow makes the engine more efficient. This effect is most pronounced when $v_{\infty}$ is low. </p>

<p>The prop tip winglets would operate in a region of high dynamic pressure and generate more friction drag without contributing to the prop's efficiency.</p>

","<p>This answer applies to the AVRO RJ (BAe 146), because this is the aircraft I've flown. Other aircraft may or may not have similar features/issues/restrictions.</p>

<h3>Reasons for APU use in mid-air</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>For takeoff</strong>, the APU bleed-air can be used to supply the cabin air pressure system to reduce load on engines. This leads to a significant reduction in runway length required. This is routinely used on short runways.</li>
<li>Similar reason <strong>for the landing</strong>, where, for the missed approach/go-around phase, a high climb gradient is required. For example in mountainous areas or combined with icing conditions, where use of engine bleed air is limited, the APU bleed air can feed the cabin pressurization.</li>
<li><strong>During flight</strong>, when in icing conditions. Similar reason as above. The air-frame anti icing system uses that much bleed-air, there is not much left for cabin pressurization (or the other way round). If the APU bleed-air is used to pressurize the cabin, the (already low) climb gradient is improved.</li>
<li><strong>During flight</strong>, in the event of a generator failure. The generator of the APU can replace one failed generator of an engine.</li>
<li><strong>To save engine life</strong>. If APU bleed air (- to pressurize cabin) is used for normal takeoff, the peak engine temperatures will be lower during takeoff. This increases engine life as the peak engine temperature is the main factor of engine life. It's significantly cheaper to replace an APU than an engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of the above cases, there are restrictions on the operation of the APU. It may not light-up above 15'000 ft or operation above 25'000 ft is not allowed or not recommended. General operating rules for the APU (common sense when using turbines) recommend to use bleed air only after couple of minutes warm-up after startup. Likewise, on shutdown, it should be left running without load to cool down for a few minutes before switching off. The exact timings differ greatly between APU models.</p>

<h3>Procedures</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Before Takeoff,</strong> If the API is not used during climb, the APU is normally shut down during taxi checks. If the pilots decide to use the APU during climb, it is started during normal engine start. In this case the APU bleed air is used to feed the cabin pressurization.</li>
<li><strong>After Takeoff</strong> depending on the model of the APU (and following airline procedures), the APU usage is limited to a specified time or altitude. Before reaching this limit, the APU has to be shut down. (cabin air changeover to the engine bleed air, cool-off period of the APU, switching off)</li>
<li><strong>During Flight</strong> In case of a technical problem or emergency, the Abnormal Checklist will suggest or dictate the use of the APU for the remainder of the flight. For example: A generator problem, the APU generator replace the failed generator. This may impose limits to flight altitude and duration.</li>
<li><strong>Before Landing</strong> Usually after passing 10'000 feet, the APU is started and before the final checks, the cabin pressurization system is switched to the APU.</li>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most countries have regulations for dazzling a pilot, regardless of the mean and power used, it's the effect that is taken into account.</li>
<li>A class 2 laser led couldn't blind someone unless the person is at a few meters (15 m for temporary blindness and 3 m for eye damages, if the eye is forced to stay open).</li>
<li>As the class is not mentioned on the label, I would be careful when seeing this item.</li>
<li>There are actually 2 laser leds, a red and a green, is it 2x1 mW or 2x0.5 mW? In practical the lasers probably can't illuminate the same eye, due to the divergence of their beams.</li>
<li>To draw a pattern a laser light must move, so the time of illumination of a point is reduced when the device is working correctly.</li>

"What risks come from passengers taking baggage during emergency evacuation?","5132","","<p>In recent news, <a href=""http://news.sky.com/story/1554989/ba-engine-fire-pilot-criticises-passengers"">the pilot of an aircraft that caught fire</a> was chastising passengers for taking their luggage. </p>

<p>What are the major concerns behind his criticism? </p>

<p>I like to put this in context:</p>

<ol>
<li>All passengers and crew survived. </li>
<li>There were no injuries. </li>
<li>Crew reported that the evacuation was very orderly and efficient. </li>
</ol>

<p>So what could be the reason for the pilot speaking out so critically? So critical, in fact, that he argues that overhead-compartment doors should lock between takeoff and landing. My guesses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>another passenger cohort could have been less orderly, and pushing with luggage resulted in injuries or people becoming trapped. </li>
<li>sliding down <em>inflatable</em> exit slides with luggage could cause the slides to puncture and trap other passengers. </li>
<li>the inflatable exit slides are not rates to carry the weight of an adult + luggage (seems unlikely unless the adult is massively obese). </li>
</ul>

<p>Would appreciate hearing a list that is not just educated guessing. </p>
","<p>As soon as there's a fire on board, the absolute top priority is <strong>getting everybody out as soon as possible</strong>. Aircraft are designed in such a way that, even after a crash landing (or other serious malfunction), the passengers will have a minute or two to evacuate before conditions in the cabin become toxic (fire, smoke, etc); this is done by using flame-retardant material and burn-through protection, but in an intense fire these won't protect the cabin for long, and once they fail no-one will be able to survive inside the aircraft for much longer than that. Smoke inhalation and oxygen deprivation kill just as effectively as being burned. </p>

<p>Therefore everyone has to be able to evacuate from the plane within 90 seconds, even assuming the plane is packed to the gills with passengers, and half the exits are inoperative. Given that the aircraft may be damaged after  a rough/crash landing, some of the doors may be unusable (due to fire or smoke just outside them), it may be dark in the cabin, and people may be injured and/or panicking, it's vital that nothing slows down the evacuation. To get an idea of what a 90-second evacuation of a fully-loaded aircraft looks like, see the video of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gqWeJGwV_U"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A380 evacuation test</a> - and these passengers were calm, uninjured, and prepared. If passengers take hand luggage with them this is slowed down:</p>

<ul>
<li>The time it takes to get it out of the overhead bins (with everyone else crushing against you to get out).</li>
<li>Carrying the luggage down the aisle (without tripping, hurting yourself or anyone else - again, look at the A380 video, and imagine trying to do that with a suitcase). If you lose your luggage, everyone behind you will have to climb over it to get to the exit.</li>
<li>Maneuvering your suitcase around the corner to the door, not getting it stuck on the door frame, with people behind you literally shoving you out the door.</li>
<li>Plunging down a <em>very</em> steep slide the height of a two-storey building (or more, in case of the A380's upper deck) at high speed, with your suitcase flailing around. At best it whacks you on the head, at worst it punctures and deflates the slide, which given the crush of passengers behind you will probably lead a few people to plummet from the aircraft doors straight to the ground.</li>
<li>Assuming you've made it to the ground, there is someone else plunging down the slide right behind you. If your suitcase slows you down even a little, they will plow right into you, and soon you'll have a crush of people at the foot of the slide.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In this specific case, the fire was fortunately not serious enough to defeat the cabin fire protection before the last passengers had evacuated</strong> - but as <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/users/8417/andy"">@Andy</a> said, there are unfortunately other examples where the passengers were not so lucky. To illustrate the risk of fire after landing: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_358"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air France Flight 358</a> ran off the runway at landing, and despite having little fuel on board, the resulting fire completely destroyed the aircraft; luckily, everyone evacuated in time. <strong>Once there's been a major malfunction, there is no way to tell how much time you have left to get out</strong> - fire can spread very very quickly - and so you have to get out as quickly as possible. Taking luggage with you endangers your life and that of your fellow passengers. </p>

"How much time does an landing/take-off add to an otherwise direct flight?","5129","","<p>I'm interested to know how much time a descent and ascent to crusing altitude takes as part of a longer journey.</p>

<p>A standard jet-aircraft (for example a A340 or 777) flys for eight hours from City A to City C. While doing so it flies over City B.</p>

<p>Now the same jet flys from City A to City C but as it approaches City B it descends and lands at B. The plane taxis to the gate. As soon as it's there it pushes back, requests take off and returns to the cruise flying to City C.</p>

<p>Approximately how much time is added to the journey by virtue of having descended, landed, taken-off and ascended to cruise ? Assume no ATC delays etc.</p>
","<p>Let's take the best case scenario to start with, and assume that the cruise ground speed of the airliner is around 400kts.</p>

<p>For our best case, we also assume that the runway is lined up with the flight path and that the airspace is quiet so the plane is cleared ""straight in"" with no vectoring for separation or holding patterns.</p>

<ol>
<li>Descent:</li>
</ol>

<p>A typical descent profile would start 100nm out, during which the plane would slow pretty uniformly from around 400kts to around 140kt. This gives an average groundspeed of 270kt. So this 100nm is covered in around 25 minutes rather the 15 minutes at full cruise.</p>

<p>The descent has cost us only <strong>10 minutes</strong>.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Taxi and turnaround:</li>
</ol>

<p>At a smallish (and well designed) airport the rollout and taxiing to the stand may only take 5 minutes, plus another 5 to attach the air bridge/stairs and open the door. Passenger and baggage turnaround would typically take around 30 minutes, but you have specifically excluded this in your question so we can ignore it. Then getting departure clearances, startup and taxiing to the active: say another 15 minutes.</p>

<p>So this phase has cost more or less <strong>25 minutes</strong>.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Take off and climb out:</li>
</ol>

<p>Again assuming we're cleared for immediate take off, it takes around 20 minutes to climb to cruise altitude, at an average ground speed of (say) 200 knots. This means we've covered about 70 miles, which the cruising aircraft would have covered in just over 10 minutes.</p>

<p>So this final phase has cost us another <strong>10 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>Total for the best case scenario is <strong>45 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course the best case is not that likely. If the airspace is busy, holding for another 10 minutes before final approach, and 10 minutes further wait for departure and takeoff clearances, would not be surprising. And if the active runway is in the ""wrong"" direction or vectoring is needed for traffic or noise reasons, that can easily add another 10 minutes or so.</p>

<p>So in the non-best case scenario, a total loss of <strong>1h15 to 1h30</strong> would not be unreasonable.</p>

"How can one enter an airliner without stairs or a jet bridge?","5121","","<p>I see that big planes (B737, A319 etc.) always need a staircase or a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_bridge"">boarding tunnel</a> in order for crew or passengers to enter the cabin since the position of the entry door is quite high (meters above the ground). What solutions are there if none of these options are available? (Except, obviously, for aircraft like DC-9's/MD-82 and 727's which had the rear entrance) How could the pilots get in?

"Can civilians fly military aircraft?","5115","","<p>I saw a few videos of the Sukhoi Su-35 doing some amazing aerobatics and I was wondering if a civilian could ever fly one - either for aerobatics or just fly it as their personal jet. </p>

<p>Obviously assume adequate training, fitness, budget, time etc. I assume you'll have to start on a jet trainer first, after you had already flown other smaller aircraft - but this is outside the scope of my question.</p>

<p>There is <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9311/civilians-buying-military-aircraft"">a question</a> that suggests civilians can buy military aircraft, but it doesn't explicitly say whether they can actually fly them. <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9311/civilians-buying-military-aircraft#comment17369_9311"">One comment seems to suggest they can't</a>, although it's not very clear.</p>
","<p>I'm not sure if you're asking about <em>flying</em> such an aircraft (e.g. renting one) or <em>owning</em> one. But either way the answer is yes.</p>

<p>I've flown a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Hunter"">Hawker Hunter</a> at a (now-defunct) location in Cape Town on a mixed low-level/acrobatic flight along the coast. There were no restrictions on who could fly in the aircraft apart from the obvious ones (no kids; must have reasonable height/weight and general fitness) but they didn't let non-pilots take the controls. We did some aerobatics (up to 5G, from memory) and I had the controls in cruise flight for about 10 minutes. There was absolutely nothing that a civilian couldn't learn: it's 'just' another aircraft.</p>

<p>As for owning one, it's not uncommon at all. Privately owned ex-military aircraft are often referred to as ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbird"">warbirds</a>"" and in the US there's even an <a href=""http://www.warbirds-eaa.org/"">EAA organization</a> for owners. The aircraft are usually considered experimental (or the local equivalent) for the purposes of regulation and airworthiness.</p>

<p>The barriers to owning these aircraft are (as always) money and training. Buying and maintaining them is very expensive because there are so few parts or mechanics available, and insuring them is (almost) impossible so most owners have to self-insure. The operating costs are also usually high, especially if the aircraft systems need 'exotic' fuels, gases, lubricants or other consumables. You may need to include explosives on the list, in the case of ejection seats.</p>

<p>Training is a similar issue because so few people can instruct you in how to fly a military aircraft, but obviously this isn't a total barrier and I assume that if you're involved in that part of the flying community then you'll find the contacts you need.</p>

<p>So in general, if you can buy a military aircraft legally in your country, if you have enough money for operations and maintenance, if you can find someone to train you, and if you can comply with your local regulations on non-type (experimental) aircraft then you can absolutely do it. But for most people that's a lot of 'ifs' :-)</p>

<blockquote>

  threshold based on which, at a given airport, incoming flights are

<p>As far as I know there is no specific threshold for which they will divert.

  wind gust, so if there is any wind gusts threshold, I expect it to be

<p>Yes, aircraft are designed with whats called a <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/201/what-is-a-demonstrated-crosswind-component"">maximum demonstrated crosswind component</a>. The key here is that this is a <em>demonstrated</em> limit not necessarily an airframe limitation. The number is <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/inst_reports2.cfm?article=3651"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">published in the POH for the aircraft made after 1975</a> and provides a general guideline of the maximum cross wind the plane can be landed safely in however its more than possible to land it in higher wind situations. </p>

<p>Also it should be noted that some of this is up to the pilot in command. Just because a towered airport clears you to land does not mean it is safe for you to do so likewise just because a pilot diverts does not mean they were instructed to do so by the tower they may self elect based on their personal abilities. </p>

"Why do some military aircraft use variable-sweep wings?","5112","","<p>There are a couple of American military aircraft (the retired F-14 and the B-1 come to mind immediately), that have variable swept wings.  I know that they keep the wings full out (roughly perpendicular to the body) during take off and landing, and they have the wings swept back for high speed flight.  </p>

<p>But I've never really understood why? I assume that at lower speeds the wings-out configuration creates more lift.  But, why does sweeping the wings back help at high speed?  </p>

<p>For bonus points: how does the performance gain make up for the cost in weight and complexity created by having a variable swept wing?  Or perhaps there isn't much of a gain and that's why most military aircraft don't have variable sweep?</p>
","<p>By sweeping wing backwards, you essentially make the air 'see' another airfoil.</p>

<p>Look at these two diagrams:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rxbT.jpg"" alt=""sweep""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQRvy.jpg"" alt=""sweep""></p>

<p>When the air meets the wing, it travels along $V$. This 'seen' airfoil is a lot thinner than $V1$ (which is perpendicular to the leading edge).  As the aircraft experiences less pressure, the aircraft experiences less drag. However, this also reduces the velocity of the air. This is good if you're looking to delay things such as shockwaves as the air goes supersonic, since spreading the force out more delays this effect and the flow separation which comes with it.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PEcZe.jpg"" alt=""shockwave""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, for all the advantages, It would have a very high landing speed. So the wings are swept forward, the aircraft has a more effective aerofoil for lower speeds, and the minimum airspeed decreases correspondingly. There is now more drag, but also more lift which you need for the slower speed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wcgsB.jpg"" alt=""wings""></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swept_wing"">Wikipedia</a> puts this nicely in not all too-complex terms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we were to begin to slide the wing sideways (spanwise), the sideways motion of the wing relative to the air would be added to the previously perpendicular airflow, resulting in an airflow over the wing at an angle to the leading edge. This angle results in airflow traveling a greater distance from leading edge to trailing edge, and thus the air pressure is distributed over a greater distance (and consequently lessened at any particular point on the surface). </p>
  
  <p>This scenario is identical to the airflow experienced by a swept wing as it travels through the air. The airflow over a swept wing encounters the wing at an angle. That angle can be broken down into two vectors, one perpendicular to the wing, and one parallel to the wing. The flow parallel to the wing has no effect on it, and since the perpendicular vector is shorter (meaning slower) than the actual airflow, it consequently exerts less pressure on the wing. In other words, the wing experiences airflow that is slower - and at lower pressures - than the actual speed of the aircraft. One of the factors that must be taken into account when designing a high-speed wing is compressibility, which is the effect that acts upon a wing as it approaches and passes through the speed of sound. The significant negative effects of compressibility made it a prime issue with aeronautical engineers. Sweep theory helps mitigate the effects of compressibility in transonic and supersonic aircraft because of the reduced pressures. This allows the mach number of an aircraft to be higher than that actually experienced by the wing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is there a performance gain? Depends on your definition:</strong></p>

<p>Having <strong>fixed</strong> swept wings would imply that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The landing speed might be unacceptably high, and with that, long runways would be required. </li>
<li>You could design a fast and light aircraft.Take the F104 Starfighter for example, which had thin, short wings for the same effect but couldn't move them, and was extremely dangerous at slow speeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having <strong>variable</strong> wings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The F14 was intended for carrier operations, where you would want a
slow landing speed. Making an aircraft go that fast would probably have been impossible otherwise. It was also designed for long range operations, adding weight of fuel.</li>
<li>Adds weight and mechanical complexity to the airframe, which increases maintenance cost and fuel burn.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I understand it correctly, today aircraft today rely more on system such as high-lift devices like for instance slats and flaps. </p>

"What is the cause of unusually strong wake turbulence from the 757?","5108","","<p>The Boeing 757 (at least in the US) is in a special class of its own with respect to air traffic control wake turbulence advisories and separation. This is apparently due to it producing stronger wake vortices than would be expected from an aircraft of similar size and weight. What about the 757's design causes these strong vortices? What led to the decision to treat it differently than similar aircraft?</p>
","<p>My understanding, primarily based on <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20090731181404/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Concept2Reality/wake_vortex.html"">this archived NASA document</a> (also linked to on the B757 Wikipedia article), is that there were several issues leading to the decision to make the 757 a special case.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, there were some notable accidents where witnesses seemed to indicate the cause was 757 wake turbulence.</p>

<p>Cessna Citation - December 18, 1992 - Billings, Montana</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Witnesses reported that the airplane suddenly and rapidly rolled left and then contacted the ground while in a near-vertical dive. Recorded ATC radar data showed that, at the point of upset, the Citation was about 2.8 nmi behind a Boeing 757 and on a flight path that was about 300 ft below the flight path of the 757.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IAI Westwind - December 15, 1993 - Santa Ana, California</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>witnesses reported that the airplane rolled abruptly and that the onset of the event was sudden. The Westwind was about 2.1 nmi behind a Boeing 757 and on a flight path that was about 400 ft below the flight path of the 757.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additional accidents were noted with a Cessna 182, MD-88, and a Boeing 737.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, there were some controversial NOAA flyby tests which showed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for a peculiar set of weather conditions that lasted about 0.5 hour, the vortex velocity of the 757 was approximately 50 percent higher than that of the 767 at similar vortex ages (younger than 60 sec) measured in less favorable weather conditions. However, the results also showed that overall the wake of the 757 decayed faster than that of the 767; in fact, the wake behaved as would be expected for an aircraft of the size and weight of the 757.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, they felt the slower approach speed of the 757 (vs. similar aircraft) made it more likely that trailing aircraft would inadvertently close the separation gap during approach.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ultimately, I believe the correct answer to your question is actually that there is nothing particularly special about the B757 in regards to wake turbulence. This <a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/need-to-know/Need_To_Know_757_hazard.html?c=y&amp;page=2"">Air&amp;Space Magazine Article</a> indicates that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boeing maintains that there is nothing about the wing design that would cause wake turbulence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The wake from the 757 is no stronger or weaker than you would predict from the weight, span, and speed of the airplane,"" agrees NASA's David Hinton, who has taken wake measurements at airports around the country and is principal investigator of NASA's NextGen Airportal Project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision to put the 757 in its own category was controversial at the time and not based on particularly strong evidence. It was done out of precaution due to anecdotal evidence and possibly flawed test results. On the other hand, you could argue that ATC erring on the side of caution is best if there is any doubt. To be fair, a 757 is on the <em>larger</em> side of the small category.</p>

","<p>During taxiing aircraft turn using their nose wheel. </p>

<p>The nose wheel is usually hydraulically controlled. The pilot operates it through a tiller. The nose gear can rotate usually quite far, sometimes to almost 90 degrees. </p>

<p>At high speeds, directional control is achieved using the rudder pedals. The nose gear is often linked to the rudder pedals, however the maximum rotation is limited. The nose gear steering does not exactly match to the the rudder steering at all speeds. At low speeds the rudder is ineffective so the nose wheel steering is dominant. For sharp turns the tiller is always used because of the limited rotation by the pedals.  </p>

<h2>Flight envelopes</h2>

<p>The way I understand it, asking about the ""maximum"" of anything for an aircraft is less useful than understanding the flight envelope. This is because the maximum depends very greatly on the exact situation of the aircraft including things like altitude, weight, speed etc.</p>

I ask since a plane I travelled in very recently was travelling at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and, when it did, turbulence was terrible (some told me I was lucky to be alive). </p>

","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Could SR-71 be shot down today?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theoretically yes. Modern day SAMs like the 40N6 that travel at speeds of Mach 6 can intercept an SR 71 within an operational range of 250 miles upto an altitude of 18 miles. Moreover, the hostile SAM will fire a salvo of missiles(at least 2-3). So the SR 71 will have to jam, drop decoys and out manoeuvre the incoming hostile missiles.Modern day SAM systems can be loaded with libraries of 3D shapes that can be used by the seeker to identify targets and threats.</p>

<p>S-400 and similar Russian/Chinese AD systems are meant to work simultaneously with ECM systems, meaning radars of enemy aircraft will be blinded  as 40N6 and 48N6 missiles zeroes in.</p>

<p>During the days of the cold war Soviet Air Force pilots were instructed to launch two rounds, a semi-active radar homing missile and a heat seeking missile.In this fashion the SR 71( or any other hostile aircraft) being targeted has a difficult problem as it must jam, decoy and/or out manoeuvre three or four tightly spaced inbound missiles</p>

<p>That being said getting in the general vicinity of an intercept is different from an actual intercept.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19310/Hitting-a-Moving-Target-The-Missile-Guidance-Syste"">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19310/Hitting-a-Moving-Target-The-Missile-Guidance-Syste</a></p>

<p>From Jane's  <strong><em>Fighter Combat in the Jet Age</em></strong> : Page 116-117 “<em>SR71 the Ultimate Target</em>” </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On June 3, 1986 an SR 71 was on a mission over the Barents Sea. Six
  Mig 31 Foxhounds, vastly superior to the Mig25 Foxbat,performed a
  coordinated intercept that would have subjected the SR71 to an
  all-angle AAM attack that even a combination of high-altitude
  maneuverability and ECM could not have defeated. Fortunately for the
  American jet, the interception took place over international waters,
  but the Soviets proved their point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact,the SR 71 was retired once the USSR started deploying S 300 SAMs in large numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I've read that SR-71 had no missile defenses because it could simply outrun any adversary. Is this still true?.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not true. The SR 71 did carry a very sophisticated Electronic Counter Measure System(ECM) called the <a href=""https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6svmtOFa1JIC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Surface%20to%20air%20missiles%20%2B%20SR%2071&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pvEeskU76C&amp;sig=5-NXYlR8Q5lFrxlbhOjRxJjEE3I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gQ6RVf61G9CFuwTWw79o&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Surface%20to%20air%20missiles%20%2B%20SR%2071&amp;f=false"">Defensive System</a></p>

<p>One of the first MiG 31 Foxhound pilots, Captain Mikhail Myagkiy, who had scrambled with his MiG-31 several times to intercept the US super-fast spy plane, explains in his book how he was able to lock on a Blackbird on Jan. 31, 1986:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scheme for intercepting the SR-71 was computed down to the last
  second, and the MiGs had to launch exactly 16 minutes after the
  initial alert. (…) They alerted us for an intercept at 11.00. They
  sounded the alarm with a shrill bell and then confirmed it with a
  loudspeaker. The appearance of an SR-71 was always accompanied by
  nervousness. Everyone began to talk in frenzied voices, to scurry
  about, and react to the situation with excessive emotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Missiles are faster and can sustain higher G loadings than SR-71.  Assuming that the SR 71 is flying at an altitude of  70,000 ft to 80,000 ft  it only needs to maneuver to out turn the missile, in order to  make the change in intercept geometry fall outside the missile's envelope. However, at extreme altitudes aircraft maneuvers are limited by stall buffet.</p>

<p>The SR-71 could fly a 7,000+ mile mission and the only segments of which are flown at sub sonic speeds  are the take-off, refueling  and landing. </p>

<p>The thing is the Soviets knew that in order for any Soviet fighter aircraft to intercept an SR-71 it had to be ahead of its known flight path. These were the tactics the Soviets deployed to even get a glimpse of the SR-71. They always knew when an SR-71 launch would occur because the KC-135 fuel tanker would take off first because the SR-71 had to be immediately refueled once airborne.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>How do the engineers, maintenance team, etc know if an aircraft has metal fatigue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, is not an ""aircraft"" that has fatigue, but a component.</p>

<p>To the naked eye, there is no way to detect metal fatigue until it starts being too late: you can only see cracks that are already forming and/or propagating.</p>

<p>There are tools available to allow for early detection, my bachelor's thesis was about one of these: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelasticity"">photoelasticity</a> of certain materials is used. A light coat of one such material is applied on the new component and the photoelastic properties and exams done during the lifetime of the component tell the maintenance people what is the current status of the inner layers of the piece.</p>

<p>Another method uses electric resistance, as metal fatigue, by cracking the metal, increases the resistance.</p>

<p>Depending on the scenario, X-rays could also be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do they do to ""minimize"" metal fatigue or repair it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot minimize fatigue, once it starts setting in, it is an irreversible process. You can delay the likely catastrophic failure by applying strengthening elements around the affected one, but the safest course of action is to replace the component and recycle the old one.</p>

"What is a localiser back-course approach and how does it work?","5054","","<p>What does back-course approach mean ? How much signal strength should the back lobe of ILS should have in order to trace it and commence landing. How common is this type of landing for a pilot. What all instruments are required for this type of landing? </p>
","<p>A localizer back course is simply flying on the back side of the localizer to the runway.  How a localizer works is it sends out two signal lobes:  one at 90Hz and the other at 150Hz.  The localizer needle in the airplane compares the relative strength it receives from both lobes and then shows a deflection.  </p>

<p>See this figure from the <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instrument Flying Handbook (2015)</a> published by the FAA.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVZHj.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVZHj.png"" alt=""Figure 9-33""></a></p>

<p>Notice the top left of the picture shows the same lobes on the same side of the runway.  Now imagine flying the front-course, the blue lobe is on the right.  If you are flying the back-course, the blue lobe would be on the left.</p>

<p>The localizer needle doesn't know if you are on the front-course or the back-course and will show the same deflection for both situations.  The problem comes in for the back-course is that the needle deflection is deflected the wrong way.</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer your questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>What does back-course mean?  It simply means you are flying on the opposite of the localizer signal.  If there is a back-course published, the signal strength will be strong enough to fly the approach as required. </li>
<li>How common is a back-course approach?  There are currently 69 back-course approaches in the United States.  There are approximately 1,893 ILS approaches.  This is around 3.5% of back-course approaches as compared to ILS approaches.</li>
<li>The same flight and navigation instruments required to fly a front-course ILS is required to fly a back-course ILS.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>From a technique standpoint.  Whenever I fly a back-course approach, irrespective of whether I am using an HSI or VOR receiver, I will always set in the front course.  For pilots that use an HSI this will provide for ""positive sensing"" meaning the needle will deflect correctly.  For pilots using a VOR, the needle will shade bottom numbers that correspond to heading that need to be flown to get back onto the back-course approach.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yHcm3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yHcm3.png"" alt=""VOR Indicator""></a></p>

<p>If this was a back-course approach, notice that the needle is deflected to the right.  Conventional wisdom says you need to turn away from the needle to re-intercept.  I say to select a heading under the needle to fly.  That heading will be approximately 120°.  Take a look at the heading indicator and determine that you most likely need to turn left to re-intercept the back-course.  Try it and you will see it works.  Conversely, I also teach the same concept for an ILS except the heading to fly is on top of the VOR indicator instead of on the bottom.</p>

  <p><strong>Altitude determines the distance shock waves travel before reaching

"What happens when a helicopter loses an engine?","5049","","<p>It seems like at this point it would be game over, since the spinning rotor is the only thing keeping it in the air. Is there any way to land a helicopter in this condition without crashing?</p>
","<p>Helicopters are able to do something called <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorotation_%28helicopter%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">autorotation</a></strong> if all thrust is lost. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a helicopter, an autorotative descent is a power-off  maneuver in
  which the engine is disengaged from the main  rotor system and the
  rotor blades are driven solely by the  upward flow of air through the
  rotor. In other  words, the engine is no longer
  supplying power to the main  rotor. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/auto-rotation.jpg"" alt=""heli""></p>

<p><em>(Look in particular at the direction of flight arrows. Remember there's a lift vector coming of the blades as well in both cases.)</em></p>

<p>Basically, the collective is decreased immediately when thrust is lost for whatever reason. This allows the airflow coming through the blades to push them around, like a reverse windmill in a way, keeping the blades spinning. This also generates lift, keeping the helicopter generating some lift (while descending of course). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the instant of engine failure, the main rotor blades are 
  producing lift and thrust from their angle of attack (AOA) 
  and velocity. By lowering the collective pitch, which must be 
  done immediately in case of an engine failure, lift and drag 
  are reduced, and the helicopter begins an immediate descent, 
  thus producing an upward flow of air through the rotor 
  system. This upward flow of air through the rotor provides 
  sufficient thrust to maintain rotor rpm throughout the descent. 
  Since the tail rotor is driven by the main rotor transmission 
  during autorotation, heading control is maintained with the 
  antitorque pedals as in normal flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the helicopter reaches ground, the pilot will pull up. Since the blades were spinning a bit faster than needed for a hover since he was flying forward the whole procedure, he simply pulls up and levels out carefully close to the ground until the helicopter touches down.</p>

<p>This being said, you have to be careful, since if you're flying to slow you can't pull it off.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When landing from an autorotation, the only energy available 
  to arrest the descent rate and ensure a soft landing is the 
  kinetic energy stored in the rotor blades. Tip weights can 
  greatly increase this stored energy. A greater amount of rotor 
  energy is required to stop a helicopter with a high rate of 
  descent than is required to stop a helicopter that is descending 
  more slowly. Therefore, autorotative descents at very low or 
  very high airspeeds are more critical than those performed 
  at the minimum rate of descent airspeed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Paul Tibbets] eased the brakes [of <em>Enola Gay</em>] at 0245, the four fuel-injected Wright Cyclone engines pounding. “The B-29 has lots of torque in take-off,” he notes. “It wants to swerve off the runway to the left. The average mass-production pilot offsets torque by braking his right wheels. It's a rough ride, you lose ten miles an hour and you delay the take-off.” Nothing so rude for Tibbets. “Pilots of the 509th Group were taught to cancel torque by leading in with the left engines, advancing throttles ahead of the right engines. At eighty miles an hour, you get full rudder control, advance the right-hand engine to full power and, in a moment, you're airborne.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not especially knowledgeable in aviation matters, but I believe that the torque is due to the B-29's four propellers all rotating in the same direction. Is that right? If so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why did this problem only arise during take-off?</li>
<li>Why did all propellers rotate the same way? Is this true for all propeller-driven aircraft with more than one engine? Why?</li>
<li>If the 509th Group's technique was so good (and apparently not especially complex), why did only they use it?</li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li><p>It didn't arise ONLY during takeoff, but it is most noticeable then for several reasons</p>

<ul>
<li>The engines are at maximum power, therefore producing maximum torque</li>
<li>You've got a very good reason to need to be travelling in an exactly straight line (the runway)</li>
<li>You're travelling at fairly slow speed, so your vertical stabilizer is less effective - at higher speeds, the tail counteracts the torque more effectively (for this B-29 this occurs at 80mph, as mentioned). As soon as you get above 80mph, you can just input a little right rudder to counteract it.... B-29's only travelled below 80mph on takeoff and landing, so it wasn't a problem during flight, and during landing the throttles were at idle or very low power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It isn't true for all aircraft with more than one engine now (although it is true for some), but it does still happen and was much common back in WWII - they didn't want the extra supply line complexity of two different sets of otherwise identical engines, when it could be solved with a bootfull of right foot. Note also that the B-29 had 4 engines, most modern multi-props only have two, and they're closer to the fuselage, which reduces the effect</p></li>
<li><p>I think you're misinterpreting the source: he's not saying this technique was unique to the 509th, just that they were taught the technique. The very fact he says they were taught it, rather than ""came up with"" it, suggests it was known elsewhere. The 509th are only referenced here because that's the group Tibbets was part of, it's unrelated.</p></li>

You are supposed to be face down, shoulders level before opening the thing. If you are on your back or tumbling you can have various parts wrap around you. High-performance canopies are somewhat more sensitive to the shoulders being level and can open in a decently fast spin. Depending on the spin direction and your altitude you may not be able to recover<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The emergency chutes are built differently, emphasizing (obviously) reliability over being able to land at 100km/h. This means that twisted lines are either recoverable or not an issue.</p>

<p>If the jumper isn't paying attention to where he is, you may find that a leading cause of going splat is not using the perfectly good canopy on your back. Automatic activators have more-or-less eliminated this as a common cause<sup>3</sup>, but if the jumper thinks that the houses look a bit too big and deploys the main at the same time as the reserve opens they may decide to wrap each other up. Ram-air canopies are like badgers - they don't like each other very much and having two open at the same time is a rather delicate situation.</p>

<p>If we turn to landing accidents, we find that there are all kinds of ways to injure or kill yourself with a fully functional canopy overhead. The aforementioned 100km/h landing speed is no joke - hit an obstacle on the ground going that fast and it's exactly the same as jumping out of a car on the highway. Buildings, trees, power lines, vehicles, running propellers etc. have all claimed their sacrifices. And don't try to land on both sides of the fence at the same time. Or in the alligator farm across the road.</p>

<p>Mechanical failure of the system is very rare - riggers won't pack worn-out reserves, and if they are concerned about someone's main they will tell the dropzone management who will usually decline to provide services until it's fixed.</p>

"What is the difference between a fix, a waypoint and an intersection?","5027","","<p>It seems these terms are used interchangeably. Are they the same thing? Do they all refer to the points in space that are given 5-letter names?</p>
","<p>No, they are not interchangeable and indeed, have well defined meanings.</p>

<p>A <strong>fix</strong> is an arbitrary point in space used to establish current position calculated by referring to external references.  You take a fix to determine where you are <strong>now</strong>.  A fix might be permanent, for example a compulsory reporting point, or it might be determined by the pilot in advance in order to fly a non-airways route (e.g. when flying VFR) and then checked along the way using dead reckoning and reference to external systems or features to check that the plan is being flown accurately.  It might also be requested by ATC, e.g. ""report when overhead the railroad yard"" or calculated to establish where you are, e.g. taking a fix from an astrolabe on a night oceanic crossing.</p>

<p>A <strong>waypoint</strong> is fixed point in 2D space (latitude and longitude) used to define points along a route.  They are named, and are referenced in a plan.  You fly from one waypoint to the next, along a route.  A waypoint is where you are flying to.  It is normally positioned where there is a change of course or altitude. </p>

<p>These are the navigation positions given the <a href=""http://www.golfhotelwhiskey.com/funny-waypoint-names/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5 letter names</a> you ask about.</p>

<p>An <strong>intersection</strong> is where two airways cross. Here, the Victor airways 15 and 76 cross at the intersection.  In this particular case, the chart symbol further shows that the V76 airway does not use the intersection, in which case the chart will include a note of the intersection usage.</p>

<p>Now sorry about this, but having said they are not interchangeable, it's not that simple.  A waypoint is also a fix (a fix is any 2D point).  But you do not call a waypoint a fix.  A fix is a 2D point which is not a waypoint, but is used for navigation.  A fix might be also be a lat and long defining the beginning of an arrival or departure procedure where you leave or enter an airway.</p>

<p>An intersection is also a fix, but it only exists to define where two airways cross (or where any other 2 lines cross, e.g. the 170 degree and 046 degree radial from two NDB beacons) so is called an intersection, not a fix.  </p>

<p>Why is such a heavy-duty material like titanium required for the tail cone? </p>

<p>I do not see how there could be any significant loads or reasons for excess temperature there.</p>
","<p>Whenever you see titanium being used on aircraft, look for heat sources. The metallic alternative aluminum is usually lighter and much cheaper.</p>

<p>In most commercial aircraft the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit"" rel=""noreferrer"">APU (Auxiliary Power Unit)</a> is in the tail, behind the rear pressure bulkhead and the empennage.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAiWbm.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAiWbm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(modified from <a href=""http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/b787/b787_schem_02.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">aerospaceweb.org</a>)</p>

<p>The APU is a small turbine and its exhaust gases are very hot (I don't have exact data and it depends on the APU model, but the exhaust temperature should be somewhere in the range between 400°C and 800°C). Aluminium has not only a low melting point (660°C), but its mechanical properties degrade fast once it gets hot. On the other hand, titanium has a higher melting point (1668°C) and still performs very well at high temperatures without significantly loosing strength.</p>

<p>While carbon fibers don't lose their mechanical properties at high temperatures, the resin types used as a matrix are very far from being able to withstand these temperatures. Even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyether_ether_ketone"" rel=""noreferrer"">PEEK</a>, probably the best resin for use at ""high"" temperatures, has a glass temperature of 143°C (melting point at 343°C). This makes resin-based composites inappropriate. An alternative would be using ceramic materials as a matrix (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_matrix_composite"" rel=""noreferrer"">CMCs</a>).

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0N5gR.jpg"" alt=""Black Hawk refueling from a C-130""></p>

<p>I imagine that if the rotor blades did make contact with the fuel hose, either the fuel would be released and be sparked and ignite, or ingested by the helicopter turbines, or the rotor would break, or all of the above!  When a helicopter is refueling, its rotor is nearly above the fuel hose, or at the maximum, maybe 20 feet away?  It's easy to imagine a bit of turbulence or a few centimeters of cyclic movement (a sneeze perhaps?) is all that it would take for the rotor to dip and come forward and contact the hose.</p>

<p>For the Osprey the propellers / rotors are behind the nose of the aircraft and thus farther away from the fuel hose, but still, like a helicopter the Osprey's rotors are very large, and are exposed as opposed to the concealed compressor blades of a jet turbine.</p>

"Why tail wheel rather than tricycle?","5017","","<p>I'm working towards my tail wheel rating and enjoying it greatly. But, people ask me why some planes have a conventional landing gear (tail wheel).</p>

<p>Why indeed? I understand perhaps why they had them originally, but is it just historical reasons? Seems like maybe it can have slightly lighter gear and perhaps simpler design, but I'm wondering if there are deeper reasons. </p>
","<p>Ratchet freak gives already most of the reasons. I might add that on a grass field the taildragger is easier to handle. The relatively high drag and long lever arm of the tailwheel or skid will help to pull the aircraft straight at low speeds when rudder control power is low. On a hard surface, however, the tricycle gear is easier to handle. Also, not only the weight, but also the drag of two wheels is less than that of three.</p>

<p>If you look at modern airplane designs, those where weight must be kept low (like aerobatic planes) still have a taildragger gear. It is also used in gliders and motor gliders, because they will operate mostly from grass strips and do not want to include internal space to accommodate three retractable wheels.</p>

<p>Big taildragger designs from the early days vanished with the emergence of concrete runways from the 1930s on and the need to brake more during rollout when wing loadings and landing speeds went up. On concrete runways, the tricycle gear handles better and <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/16957/is-there-a-good-reason-why-modern-airliners-cant-have-conventional-landing-gear/16962#16962"">gives much better visibility</a>. Without the ability to brake hard, the rollout lengths of  taildraggers would prohibit todays wing loadings. With retractable gears the drag disadvantage is no more, and the increased weight can be tolerated.</p>

"How does an aircraft tailplane work?","5013","","<p>How does an aircraft tailplane keep the aircraft stable, and prevent it from tipping over? Also, how does the lift generated by a tailplane compare to that generated by the wing?</p>
","<p>For conventional designs, the tail is composed of two parts: the horizontal tail and the vertical tail. They play a role in the trim and the manoeuvrability of the aircraft but at different levels. The horizontal tail is mainly used for longitudinal stability (and trim) while the vertical tails used for the lateral stability (and trim).</p>

<h3>About Stability</h3>

<p>It is possible to talk of stability only after having defined an equilibrium point around which the stability is studied. An aircraft is in equilibrium if the forces and moments it experiences are balanced. Using a simple model for the longitudinal analysis, it can be decomposed in three relations called the trim equations. In order to keep it simple, it will be assumed here that the angle of attack and the flight path angle are zero. (Note that the same reasoning can be achieved with non-zero values but the equations then become quite messy.)</p>

<h3>Longitudinal Equilibrium</h3>

<p>These three equations are:</p>

<p>$$L=mg$$
$$T=D$$
$$M=0$$</p>

<p>where $L$ is the total lift, $mg$ is the weight of the aircraft, $T$ is the thrust, $D$ is the drag and $M$ is the pitching moment around the centre of gravity of the aircraft. The second equation won't be studied further since it does not help to understand the role of the horizontal tail and its influence. Looking at the following picture, one can see that usually, the centre of gravity and the point where the lift applies (called the aerodynamic centre) are not the same. This means that the lift generated by the wing creates an induced moment around the centre of gravity that one should add to the already intrinsic pitching moment due to the main wing (usually a pitch down moment for conventional airfoils).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rM5V8.png"" alt=""Longitudinal Stability""></p>

<p>Knowing that, it is possible to rewrite the two equations of interest including the contributions from the main wing and from the horizontal tail.</p>

<p>$$W+L_t=L_w$$
$$M_0+bL_t=aL_w$$</p>

<p>From these equations and the figure, it appears that the horizontal tail is used to generate a lift which induces a moment helping to balance the moments equilibrium and thus prevent the aircraft to spin on itself (pitchwise).</p>

<h3>Drawback and Solution</h3>

<p>From both the figure and the equations it turns out that the lift contribution from the tail is usually negative, meaning that more lift from the main wing is needed to keep a trimmed (or balanced) aircraft. This drawback can be overcome by the use of a canard configuration instead.</p>

<h3>Lateral Stability</h3>

<p>The same can be done for the lateral equilibrium and stability but there it is the vertical tail that is used. It is symmetrical so that there is no yaw induced and if there is some side force experienced, it will create a moment in order to reduce the side-slip angle.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Lift Created by the Tail and Main Wing</h3>

<p>For a trimmed configuration, it is easy to see that the lift created by the main wing is more or less the one created by the tail plus the total weight of the aircraft, which gives an idea of the difference between the two forces.</p>

  <p>So in short, the best materials fall short of achieving our aim by a factor of just over 2. It is conceivable we might push up the stiffness / density ratio by perhaps developing some kind of Beryllium foam. For example, a closed cell foam of this Beryllium with a relative density of 0,041 would give a value of about 920 at the expense of lowering the Young's modulus to about 600MPa - however, I have no idea if such a foam is even possible. Alternatively it might be possible to come up with some clever engineering of the envelope geometry to overcome the buckling constraint. However, I suspect the effort is unlikely to pay off with a better boyancy ratio than is already achievable by conventional balloons.</p>

"Why didn't the A330neo and A320neo share the cockpit of the A350?","5009","","<p>Recently Airbus presented its lastest projects A330neo and A320neo.</p>

<p>I'm sincerely surprised about the cockpit, in that it is essentially the same of the original A330, while I was expecting that renovation would affect not only the engines, installations, and lights but also the cockpit instrumentation taking inspiration from the new bigger screens of the <strong>A350</strong>.</p>

<p>I know that in this way the training for pilots is much easier, but at the same time I think that if a new cockpit is developed for a new plane (taking into consideration that ""Type Rating"" is anyway considered the same), it should be because of more safety, readability, and situational awareness.</p>

<p>In the past Boeing completely updated its cockpit inside the B747-400 and B737NG models from the original mechanical/analog gauges to the new glass cockpit. In those cases, surely the necessary training was very hard for pilots so, why not now for minor updates?</p>
","<p>The short answer is that it's what the market wanted.  There is  always a lot of discussions between the airlines and manufacturer's before Airbus or Boeing commits to building a new aircraft.  In this case both Boeing and Airbus came to the same decision -- the airlines were being driven by one single factor to replace their A320 or B737 fleets, they just wanted to reduce fuel expenses.  That's why the Airbus is the 'neo' new engine option.  </p>

<p>The airlines made it clear that any new aircraft purchases would be based on operational savings and that's primarily driven by fuel burn and the resulting costs.  The solution to that is a new engine.  Putting in a new flight deck is a huge expense for the manufacturers which would drive costs up and the airlines won't pay extra for something that doesn't save them money.  </p>

<p>There's no cost benefit to a new flight deck, especially when (as others noted) you have a huge investment in an existing fleet.  In fact, all it's likely to do is add costs.  With a new flight deck you'll have a huge increase in maintenance and spares costs due to the need for stocking more parts with new part numbers (just adding a part number to a logistics system costs significant money.)  You'll also need new crew training simulators due to the different displays and controls, whereas the neo option can be handled with software upgrades.  And if it drives a need for new type ratings, that would mean more training costs and making sure you have the crews with the right rating at the right time. </p>

<p>In my experience in 20 years dealing with this market, airlines only spend money for two reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>It will increase their profit margins </li>
<li>The FAA (or other regulatory agency) mandates that they have it.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from that, you should consider Airbus' side.  They're trying to sell airplanes and they have to compete with Boeing.  Since the avionics architecture is quite different between the A320/A330 and the A350, moving to it would add huge costs and a couple years delay in entry into service.  They also have to deal with the fact that airlines don't want to see a big price increase.  Prices for the A320neo and B737MAX are not significantly higher than the current/older versions.  If the competition can offer a 7 to 9% reduction in fuel burn for approximately current prices, spending an extra 2 or 3 years to match that with a new flight deck means a lot of lost sales in the interim.  And you probably won't make enough margin to recoup the new flight deck costs.  </p>

  Convention on International Civil Aviation may apply for and be issued
  a U.S. private pilot certificate with the appropriate ratings if the
  foreign pilot license meets the requirements of this section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You apply to the FAA and they check with Germany (or wherever) that your foreign license is valid. If it is, they'll issue a foreign-based license ""with the appropriate ratings"" with no flight or theory test of any kind required. That's for VFR only; if you're instrument rated then you also have to do a theory test as well if you want to fly IFR.</p>

<p>That sounds great - and I suppose it is - but there are two big practical concerns. First, any limitations on the foreign license are applied, e.g. if your license is for daytime VFR only then you're still restricted to that, even if a regular FAA license would allow night VFR. And if your foreign license expires or becomes invalid for any reason, the FAA one does too.</p>

<p>Second, you won't have been required to learn anything about US regulations or flying practices. So you might not fly safely or legally because you simply don't know the rules or even what services are available to you as a pilot (FSS, Flight Following, TRSA etc.). One way to handle this is to get some general orientation or introductory training from a US instructor or school, but as a foreigner that will require TSA approval unless you can do it as ground school only (which is <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=aab5506849ce022b72a376259dfecffd&amp;node=49:9.1.3.5.16.1.10.2&amp;rgn=div8"" rel=""noreferrer"">not defined</a> as ""flight training""). But you might find - as I did - that some instructors will not work with a foreign student at all until they have TSA approval, whether or not it's just ground work.</p>

<p>The other option is to get a normal, full FAA license. You have to pass the same FAA medical, written and flight tests as US pilots to the same <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_standards/"" rel=""noreferrer"">standards</a>. You can count your previous flight time towards the required hours but you do need to be able to pass the tests so you will certainly need some instruction. And as a foreigner you will need TSA approval before you can receive any flight training.</p>

<p>The big advantage of getting a full license is that it never expires. If you really want to get one and you have the time and money then you could look into spending a month somewhere suitable in the US (Florida? Arizona?) at a flight school to get it as quickly and cheaply as possible.</p>

"At what speeds can an airplane land?","4998","","<p>I have read people's stories that they landed their small planes (e.g. C172) on bigger airports. They strongly recommended landing at a higher speed and without flaps as the runways are quite long, and there is traffic behind them.</p>

<p>Hence, if I want to land <em>an</em> airplane at higher than recommended landing speed (e.g. V<sub>S<sub>0</sub></sub>):</p>

<ol>
<li>How fast can I go?</li>
<li>What is the procedure to do this?</li>
<li>What consequences are there (good or bad)?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I suppose it depends on what you mean by ""land"" -- For our purposes I'll define landing as putting the aircraft on the ground and decelerating to taxi speed, while meeting the other requirements of a ""good landing"" (shiny side up; rubber side down; aircraft, pilot, and passengers in reusable condition).</p>

<h3>How fast can I go?</h3>

<p>Generally you want to put the wheels on the ground at (or at least very close to) the aircraft's stall speed and then decelerate to a safe taxi speed. You can certainly force the wheels onto the ground at higher speeds, but you're still an aerial vehicle at that point and you have to bleed off the excess speed to transition to a ground (taxiing) vehicle before you can leave the runway.  </p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb your final approach speed should be about 1.3 times stall speed for your selected landing configuration so you can get down to taxi speed reasonably quickly.  Putting that into some kind of context, a normal approach speed (with full flaps) in the Piper Cherokee I fly is around ~65 knots. A no-flaps approach is ~75 knots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking a little deeper, you can fly the approach as fast as you want (within reason) <em>as long as you're comfortable doing that and confident in your ability to bleed off the extra speed with precision</em>.<br>
  At my home field I've been chased down final by jets often enough that I know I can maintain 85+ knots until about a half-mile final, at which point I can reliably dump the extra speed, put the wheels down in the touchdown zone, and decelerate to taxi speed in time to make a ""normal"" turn-off. I also know that if it seems like I will need to carry more than about 85 knots by the half-mile point I'm better off telling ATC I'll go around and land after the faster traffic because I may not be able to safely decelerate and turn off the runway with enough room for the traffic behind me to land.<br>
  Keeping your speed up is really only helpful if you don't botch the landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>What's the procedure for doing this?</h3>

<p>The procedure is basically ""Keep your speed up until short final"" -- It's something you can practice with your CFI pretty easily.<br>
If you elect to land without flaps the procedure is the same as the ""no-flap landings"" you should have done in training, and in most small aircraft that should be a non-event. Again, this is something you can practice with your CFI pretty easily, and it's a technique you should be familiar with in case your flap controls ever fail.</p>

<hr>

<h3>What are the consequences?</h3>

<p>Well, the good part is you'll be helping out ATC and the traffic behind you: if you can keep your speed up ATC will be better able to maintain separation between you and the faster aircraft behind you, instead of having to send them around or vector / re-sequence them for spacing.<br>
It's also fun to do this kind of thing occasionally, and helps keep your skills sharp.</p>

<p>The bad part is that any time you're not flying a ""normal"" approach you're accepting some additional level of risk. In this case you're also touching down faster, which means more energy to dissipate (hopefully through braking, but if something goes wrong you'll be dissipating that energy through impact, and as dvnrrs pointed out the energy you need to get rid of is proportional to the square of your velocity so the number goes up fast).</p>

<hr>

<p>Remember that ultimately flying a fast final or touching down in an alternate (faster) configuration is a courtesy to ATC and the traffic you're mixing with.<br>
If you're comfortable doing it everyone will appreciate your help, but if you aren't comfortable with it just fly a normal approach and let ATC know you are <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg/U.HTM""><code>unable</code></a> to fly faster -- the worst thing ATC will do is ask you to go around and re-sequence you with more space next time.</p>

","<p>Indirectly, as the difference between true air speed and ground speed.</p>

<p>Since aircraft cannot measure true air speed, several steps are needed to arrive at the correct wind speed:</p>

<ol>
<li>The pitot tube (big aircraft have several of them) gives the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_pressure"">stagnation pressure</a> of the air, which is the sum of static and dynamic pressure.</li>
<li>The static ports (again, big aircraft have several of them) give the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_pressure"">static pressure</a> of the ambient air, so the dynamic pressure can be isolated.</li>
<li>With the static pressure and the ambient temperature the air density can be calculated.</li>
<li>With the density it is now possible to calculate the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_airspeed"">true air speed</a> from the dynamic pressure.</li>
<li>From the compass you get the heading of the aircraft, so you know the direction of the true air speed.</li>
<li>The ground speed and track direction can be calculated by repeatedly measuring the location of the aircraft and dividing the distance by the time between measurements, or with modern aircraft it can be read directly from the GPS display.</li>
<li>Wind speed and direction can be calculated by subtracting the true air speed vector from the ground speed vector.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will notice that there are a lot of possible sources of error in this procedure. All instruments involved have their own bias and offset error. However, if everything is carefully calibrated and corrected, the result can be very accurate.</p>

","<p>Really depends on what you are flying, what's growing, what season and what the roads are like. Our Cessnas have used gravel roads a couple of times, either due to problems aloft or at the airport (bad weather).

"How does an airliner deal with cabin altitude at an airport above 8000 ft?","4974","","<p>There are a number of airports above <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_commercial_airports"">8000 ft altitude</a>. <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8500c800f7148711696c29a64638db23&amp;node=se14.1.25_1841&amp;rgn=div8"">FAR 25.841</a> states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 feet at the maximum operating altitude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does an airliner operating from a high airport, say from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado_International_Airport"">El Dorado</a>, deal with cabin pressure? Do they actually <em>pressurize</em> the cabin after takeoff and <em>depressurize</em> it after landing? </p>

<p>Note: the answer can be of any jurisdiction though FAA seems relevant here as US airlines operate from there.</p>
","<p>Here is the text extracted from Boeing's 777 Flight Crew Operations Manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In cabin altitude controller cruise mode, maximum cabin altitude is 8,000 feet. When the takeoff field elevation is higher than 8,000 feet, the cabin <strong><em>descends</em> to the cabin cruise altitude while the airplane is climbing</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>When the destination airport elevation is greater than 8,000 feet, cabin altitude controller cruise mode <strong>maintains a cabin altitude of 8,000 feet</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>(...)</p>
  
  <p>At touchdown, the outflow valves open to depressurize the cabin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, when the airplane is on the ground, its cabin altitude is always equal to the ambient altitude. When it is in the air, the maximum is 8000 feet. Whether the cabin altitude will <em>climb</em> to 8000 feet or <em>descend</em> to 8000 feet depends on field elevation.</p>

<p>The reverse happens upon landing. If landing at an airport at 10,400 feet, the cabin altitude is &lt;= 8000 feet until touchdown, then <em>raises</em> to 10,400 feet.</p>

<p>This make sense - if the outside pressure is greater, how do you open the door? (well with enough force you can, but I will leave it to your imagination as to what happens the moment the door is opened).</p>

The question is - should I establish additional communications or report to the approach controller about flying through the class C and D airspace, or I am already permitted to do this?</p>
","<p>Lets back up a minute and discuss what is required to enter C and D airspace. </p>

<p>For C and D airspace you must establish 2 way radio communications with tower or approach controller. Let's first discuss how this works if you are not taking Flight Following. As you approach Class C airspace you hail them and wait for a response, for example, </p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Controller: ""1234J Squawk 1-3-5-2 and Ident""</p>

<p>Since the controller responded with your tail number you may enter the Charlie airspace (Delta has the same requirements). </p>

<p>Now when you are under Flight Following, ATC will coordinate a handoff to the Approach or Tower for the airspace you are about to enter, or ATC will say ""radar services terminated,"" and you must contact the controller/tower yourself before entering. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[use] flight controls, flaps, doors, water rudder, and power correctly
  so as to follow the desired course while sailing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how does it all work? Why/when/how do you use doors and flaps to steer? Are the water rudders connected to the pedals (like brakes on a land aircraft) or is there a separate steering control? What about braking: is there any, or do you just drift gradually to a stop?</p>
","<p>Seaplanes mostly have water rudders that are used at lower speeds and are retractable (actually, they tilt out of the water flow).  At higher speeds, like takeoff runs and landings, high speed taxis, they are retracted and the primary means of steering is the plane's rudder.  Water rudders are connected to the regular rudder pedals.  </p>

<p>Airlerons can also be used to steer a seaplane on the water by creating differential lift and drag (since most ailerons don't deflect symmetrically). </p>

<p>Doors can be used to steer by opening one or the other, creating drag on one side or the other.  I have seen a C-150 pilot do this in the air, as well.  Flaps, which create symmetrical drag, can be used to assist in slowing down but they're not useful for steering.  </p>

<p>Seaplanes have no brakes other than the drag of the floats in the water, so a seaplane pilot won't approach a dock at a perpendicular angle.  Instead, they will land along side a dock and then jump out onto a float and then to the dock, rope in hand.  </p>

<p>Seaplane pilots also carry oars, which allow them, yes, to paddle, steer, and stop the plane. </p>

<p>So seaplane pilots have a number of tools at their disposal to steer the plane on the water. You can also read through the <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/seaplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-23-3.pdf"">FAA Handbook for seaplane operations</a>.</p>

Additionally, inferences that if power/lights go off, you'll be stepped on and trip people, particularly people in your row (don't know how this applies so much if you're a couple/by yourself), and in the way in the necessity of evacuation, or in the case of a flight attendant needing to rush to the window to look out.

<ul>
<li>Class A: Crew will easily discover fire from their station (and therefore be able to suppress it as well)</li>
<li>Class B: There is a fire/smoke detection system, and access for crewmember to use a hand fire extinguisher</li>
<li>Class C: There is a fire/smoke detection system to alert the crew, and a fire extinguishing/suppressing system installed</li>
<li>Class E: For cargo-only aircraft (no passengers): There is a fire/smoke detector, and a way to shut off air flow to the compartment</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically, there has to be some way to both detect and address a cargo fire. Class A compartments are those such as in the cockpit where a detection system is not necessary. It sounds like the ATR example would be Class B, since they had a fire indication, and the crew had access to extinguish the fire themselves.</p>

<p>In larger planes with cargo in the lower hold, the compartments are usually Class C, so they have a detection system and a suppression system, and in-flight access is not required. As <a href=""//aviation.stackexchange.com/a/9709/1696"">David Richerby's answer</a> notes, the compartment may be accessible, but that doesn't mean that crew could effectively locate or fight a fire in those areas. Especially for large cargo holds, a fire suppression system installed througout the hold is much more effective than crew members gaining access at certain locations. This also provides the benefit of isolating the main cabin from the fire extinguishing agents.</p>

<p>How is the weight of these airplanes measured so precisely (note that in the 747-400 example is precise to the unit's place!). Is the sum of the weights of all the parts used? Also, is Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) the same as empty weight?</p>
","<p>The empty weight of airplanes can only be given to single-pound precision for one specific airplane. Minute differences in metal sheet thickness, equipment and paint will make sure that there is a difference of many pounds between airplanes of the same type and furnishing. Add to this the difference in seating, galleys and instrumentation between airplanes of the same type which are operated by different airlines, and a precise number as in your question becomes almost meaningless. A better way would be to give a range in which most airplanes will fall, or to round the number like the Concorde weight of your question.</p>

<p>Weighing is quite straightforward: All tires of the landing gear are placed on scales and the weights are summed up. If the attitude of the airplane does not change, the weight on the tires can even be measured consecutively, so only one scale is needed. Small floatplanes can be suspended from a crane with a scale in the line holding the aircraft.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Heinkel"">Ernst Heinkel</a>'s biography he remembers an aircraft deal with the Soviet Union in the late 1920s. He had to deliver five floatplanes of a specified weight, and the Russian approval inspectors insisted on all planes having the exact same weight. Of course the planes were not identically heavy, but his advantage was that the scale in his factory was indicating the weight by printing it on cards. So the evening before the inspectors came, he let one aircraft be weighed five times, put the cards back into the machine and had the printing mechanism disabled. The next day he closed the business successfully with his very happy Russian guests.</p>

<p>If you mean a <em>trim tab</em> attached to a control surface, then the answer is no. Many airplanes which have a trim control do not use a trim tab. For example, Pipers have an <em>anti-servo</em> tab on the elevator, which the pilot uses to reduce control forces. </p>

"Does electrical usage contribute to fuel consumption?","4888","","<p>I know that while in-flight the electricity is produced by the engines. </p>

<p>What happens if every possible system requiring electricity is in the <code>on</code> state? This should require extra electricity.</p>

<p>Does this usage of electricity increase the fuel consumption by any means?</p>

<hr>

<p>*Edit to include the additional question from the comments section:</p>

<p>Given that the engines require fuel to produce electricity how big is the impact on fuel consumption, speaking of ""mainstream"" airliners like the A320?</p>

<hr>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

<p>In flight, unless you use external energy sources like the Sun, each change in the use of electricity leads to a proportional change in the quantity of fuel burnt in the engines (or in the APU).</p>

<p>On an aircraft, generators only convert fuel potential chemical energy into something else, usually electricity, hydraulic energy or pneumatic energy. </p>

<p>There is no other source of energy:</p>

<ul>
<li>The batteries themselves need to be charged, charging burns fuel.</li>
<li>The RAT (<a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/7702/where-can-i-get-a-high-res-photo-of-the-rat-from-an-a320-airbus"">ram air turbine</a>) uses energy from the relative wind created by the engines thrust. If the RAT is used because the engines and the APU are down, the relative wind is due to the loss of altitude created by the gravity. This kinetic energy is the restitution of the <a href=""http://buildingontheword.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mousetrap.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">potential energy</a> accumulated during the climb with the engines, so with fuel.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p><em>Maximum power of the electrical equipment</em></p>

<p>The electrical power needs of the whole aircraft can be completely met by a single engine generator, or by the APU. On the A320 family, the APU is an <a href=""https://hsapps.utc.com/powersystems/products/aps3200pds.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">APS3200</a> delivering about 90 kVA.</p>

<p><em>APU fuel consumption</em></p>

<p>From this <a href=""http://www.pprune.org/tech-log/381639-a320-apu-average-hour-fuel-burn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PPRuNE</a> discussion, an A320 APU may consume 130 kg per hour on the ground, and 51 kg per hour at FL300. However the APU provides at the same time electricity and bleed air energy.</p>

<p><em>APU fuel consumption for electrical energy generation</em></p>

<p>However the fuel quantity used for the sole electricity generation may be approximated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maximum power required by the aircraft equipment → 90 kVA AC.</li>
<li>Assuming a mean cos φ = 0.8 → Apparent power = 110 kW DC.</li>
<li>Assuming 25% efficiency for the system (gas turbine + generator) → Fuel power required 440 kW.</li>
<li>Fuel energy required → 440 kWh per hour.</li>
<li>Converting to joules (1 MJ = 0.28 kWh) → 440 kWh ≈ 1,570 MJ.</li>
<li>Kerosene specific energy = 43 MJ/kg → Fuel quantity burnt in an hour = 1,570 / 43 = 36 kg (45 L)</li>
</ul>

<p>So approximately 36 kg of fuel are required per hour to provide for electric energy on an A320.</p>

<p>Note that in flight all engines generators will be active and will share the total demand (feeding different buses for safety), and the APU will likely be inactive. The fuel consumption should be more or less the same, regardless of the number and nature of the active generators. An inactive or unloaded engine generator can be seen as not impacting the fuel consumption for practical purposes.</p>

<p><em>Engines burning the maximum rate of fuel</em></p>

<p>Engines have a maximal power. When the engines are already at full thrust, increasing the electric load will divert an additional amount of energy to the generator. This quantity being removed from the energy usable for aircraft propulsion, the aircraft will slow down.</p>

<p><em>(Updated, taking into account the multiple helpful comments -- Thanks!)</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>

<p>Breathing increases fuel use too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each time a passenger breathes, they reject heat and CO2 which must be evacuated out of the aircraft.</li>
<li>Some quantity of air must be replaced by new air by the conditioning system.</li>
<li>This system uses pneumatic or electric energy, and again fuel must be burnt to create this energy.</li>
</ul>

"Why are critical flight computers redundant?","4884","","<p>At least in airliners, the truly critical computers are redundant. Typically three identical copies of the autopilot computers run in parallel and compare results; if one computer disagrees with the other two, its output is ignored. The system allows some processors to be faulty while maintaining the operation of the overall system.</p>

<p>But why? I've never heard of microprocessors suddenly failing. Sure, there could be manufacturing errors, but those would have been caught at the factory. Perhaps the program (and its proof) is wrong, but it would be wrong in the same way across the processors. Similarly, bad input would cause bad output across all three computers. What kind of errors does this redundancy protect against? Do microprocessors sometimes just do math wrong?</p>

<p>If a microprocessor is overheated or overloaded and spontaneously fails, I would expect it to stop doing anything and produce no output. To deal with this kind of failure, you'd want to have a backup processor, but you wouldn't need to compare the outputs of three computers—any output produced would be assumed correct, so you'd be happy to directly use the output of any processor that was producing output. </p>

<p>Related: The answer to <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/3416/what-is-the-purpose-of-multiple-autopilots?rq=1"">What is the purpose of multiple autopilots?</a> simply says ""redundancy"" before going into how this is achieved.</p>
","<p>Failure modes to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overheating. This changes the chip's timing properties and eventually results in error. This can manifest as single-bit errors in the middle of seemingly normal operation; it will <em>eventually</em> crash, but may output bad data first.</li>
<li>Water damage. Manifests as a parasitic resistance on the board and may cause you to misinterpret bits as high or low. May be leaky housings, condensation, etc.</li>
<li>Electromagnetic interference. (The system is supposed to be resistant to this, but it's still worth thinking about).</li>
<li>Physical connection problems. Either during construction (soldering faults) or induced afterwards (heat, vibration). Microscopic cracks in boards or joints can pass QA but result in intermittent faults. Again this can lose you a single bit at a time. This is related to the Xbox ""red ring of death"" issue.</li>
<li>Failure of other components. Capacitors are the usual suspect; electrolytic, tantalum, ceramic all have different failure modes. Again this may result in a system that <em>mostly</em> works but is prone to misinterpreting marginal values or suffers from timing drift.</li>
<li>Weird materials science (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold-aluminium_intermetallic"">""Purple plague""</a>, tin whiskers due to lead-free solder)</li>
<li>Part QA may not be up to the standards you expect (suppliers shipping inferior parts with a bogus ""aerospace grade"" label). Hard to detect even after it's happened.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's important to recognize that in high-speed digital systems you don't get nice clean ""one"" and ""zero"", you get a series of rising and falling edges that are smeared out by the parasitic capacitance and inductance of the wiring. This is inherently vulnerable to being misinterpreted in marginal electrical conditions.</p>

<p>At what temperature does it start to become beneficial to preheat a piston aircraft engine prior to starting, and how does one ensure that the engine is thoroughly and evenly heated?<br>
I'm pre-heating on the ramp, using a forced-hot-air heater.</p>
","<p>I'm going to be referring to <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/maint/182846-1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an old AvWeb article by Mike Busch</a> with my links in this post.<br>
As with most of what Mike writes, it's worth a good read.</p>

<h1>Why is Pre-Heating Important?</h1>

<p>Pre-heating your engine in the winter is important for a bunch of reasons, but there are two main ones that should get your attention - the first is preventing <em>metal-on-metal wear</em> by ensuring all parts have adequate clearances to function, and the second is improving <em>lubrication</em> by making sure your oil is ready to flow, and the spaces it's going to flow in to are opened up enough to let the oil in.</p>

<h2>Metal-on-Metal Wear</h2>

<p>Starting a piston engine is responsible for most of the wear the engine sees in its life - surfaces which have long since had their protective coatings of oil drip off are banging together while you crank the engine, and for a few seconds after startup until the oil pump can build up pressure and splash lubrication in the crank case can thoroughly coat the other moving parts.</p>

<p>In the case of a truly <em>cold</em> start there's an additional complication: like <a href=""https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/356/64"">2NinerRomeo points out</a>, different metals in your engine have different coefficients of thermal expansion, and you have steel (probably several alloys), aluminum, brass, and a few others in your powerplant. <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/maint/182846-1.html?redirected=1#bearings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">When cold the clearances between these metals can be so tight that the additional wear is substantial</a>, and at a certain point you may even damage the engine by attempting a start, shaving or spinning bearings and scuffing cylinder walls with the rapidly expanding pistons once the engine fires.</p>

<h2>Lubrication</h2>

<p>The other factor to consider in a cold start is lubrication - both the oil doing the lubricating, and the spaces into which it needs to flow.</p>

<p>Take the dipstick out of a cold engine and you will marvel at how the oil just clings there in a thick layer (this is especially true of heavy single-grade oil like 100W, but even 15W50 starts getting very sticky down in the 30°F-35°F range).  Oil that has thickened up from the cold doesn't pump very well - your engine may take a longer than normal time to develop oil pressure, and narrow spaces may get little to no lubrication until the oil has heated (and thinned) enough to get through the narrower oil galleys and tight spaces between some components.</p>

<p>Those tight spaces, as I mentioned under Metal-on-Metal Wear, tend to be tighter when it's cold, which means it's even harder for oil to work its way in and build up a good film of fluid. Until that film is built up and doing its job your engine is really <em>inadequately lubricated</em>, even if it's running. (Check out the webinar video in 2NinerRomeo's answer where Mike Busch goes into a lot of detail on how oil works, he has a nice explanation of the fluid film lubrication process.)</p>

<h1>How do I make sure I do my preheat right?</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/maint/182846-1.html?redirected=1#finest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The best preheat possible is spending the night in a nice, warm, heated hangar.</a> It basically guarantees that every part of your aircraft has been brought up to the same temperature, and even affords you a nice place to preflight as opposed to doing it out on the ramp in the 6-but-feels-like-60 knot winter winds.  </p>

<p>A hangar preheat isn't just the best for your engine -- your gyro instruments get brought up to a nice warm temperature (remember, mechanical gyros have to spin up, and they have the same issues as your engine did in terms of clearances being reduced by the cold), and the ship's battery gets warmed up too so it's ready to provide its best possible cranking current.</p>

<h3>I don't have a hangar you insensitive clod!</h3>

<p>Unfortunately some of us (like ME) don't have hangars - heated or otherwise - or our local FBO charges a hefty sum to spend the night in the warm. Those of us without hangars have to make due with a ramp pre-heat of some kind.  I'm going to assume you're in the same boat as me (no hangar, no electricity), and have to use some other technique.</p>

<p>Most ramp pre-heats where you have neither a hangar nor electricity take the form of a <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/news/maint/182846-1.html?redirected=1#hotair"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""forced hot air"" system</a> - either one wheeled around by the FBO, or portable ones powered by propane. <a href=""http://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/eppages/ncpreheater.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There are even ones built around a camp stove</a> which are deceptively good at the job (and in a pinch can burn the avgas you drained checking your tanks for water).</p>

<p>The general procedure for a forced-hot-air preheat is to point the heat into the cowl's cooling inlets, letting the warm air flow over and around the engine and out the cooling outlets. Start the heater up before your preflight, and with a little luck by the time you're done with the walk-around your engine will be ready to start.<br>
If it's extremely cold you may want to block part of the inlets and put a blanket over the cowling during the pre-heat to help keep the heat trapped on the engine, and as 2NinerRomeo points out, when using a high-intensity heat source like a propane heater make sure you don't pump so much heat into the cowling that you blister your paint.  A gradual warm-up is what you want - we're slow-roasting the engine, not broiling it.</p>

<h2>How do I know the preheat is ""done""?</h2>

<p>There are three common ways to tell if your preheat has had enough time to adequately warm your engine - each technique works pretty well, and you can use whichever makes the most sense for your situation.</p>

<h3>Testing by feel</h3>

<p>This is classic if you have a cowling that can be easily opened like most Piper aircraft, just feel all of your cylinders and the crankcase. They should, if your preheat was thorough enough, all be slightly warm to the touch. It's low-tech, but it works well if you can use it.<br>
As a practical matter it's usually easier to tell if the ""top end"" (cylinders) are ready this way than it is the ""bottom end"" crank case / crankshaft / bearings), but with some cowlings (many Cessnas, or my Cherokee 180) you're simply not getting your hand in there to feel the engine: you can reach the front cylinders and a bit of the case, but the aft half of the engine is basically inaccessible without taking the cowling apart (and losing all that trapped heat).</p>

<h3>Testing with the dipstick</h3>

<p>Another good indicator is that when you take the dipstick out of the engine the oil flows off nicely -- compare with how thick and syrupy the oil was in the cold engine and is should be obvious when it's ""ready"".<br>
This works for pretty much every engine, even if the only access you have is the little oil door, but it's also one of the slowest &amp; most conservative indicators: pretty much all the thermal mass of the engine needs to heat up before the oil in the sump is going to get warmed up and start to loosen up.</p>

<h3>Checking with your instruments</h3>

<p>The final way to check the status of your preheat is to check your engine instruments: If your cylinder head temperatures are all reading something reasonable (say 60-70F) and your oil temperature is at least ""off the peg"" your engine has been thoroughly heated.<br>
This technique is a little instrumentation-dependent though -- some engines may not show an oil temperature indication until you get your oil up into the 90 degree range (which would be great for start-up, but lousy for sitting on the ramp waiting). For those engines you probably want to use the dip stick test to check if the oil is ""ready"".<br>
This technique also works best if you have individual cylinder probes, as you can determine if your engine has been evenly heated (this is especially true of longer engines, like a 6-cylinder powerplant: if the front cylinders have been getting blasted with warm air and are in the 90s, but the rear cylinders are still reading 30 degrees you may need to adjust your preheat procedure to warm those rear cylinders!)</p>

<hr>

<h1>Parting Thoughts - Stuff outside the engine compartment?</h1>

<p>I've concentrated mostly on pre-heating the engine, which is what most people think about when they think about pre-heating aircraft, but as I mentioned briefly it's worth noting that other parts of the aircraft benefit from pre-heating too.  </p>

<p>For example, a warm battery (60-70°F) will crank better than a cold one. If your battery is in the engine compartment it will get warmed up during your preheat, otherwise you should be aware that cold starting puts a pretty heavy demand on the battery, and your battery will appreciate if you limit cranking as much as practical.  </p>

<p>Similarly, your gyro instruments (turn &amp; bank, directional gyro, attitude indicator) will all need to spin up - that happens in a hurry (as soon as you hit the master for the electric ones, as soon as the engine catches and the vacuum pump starts really spinning for the vacuum driven ones).<br>
If you can direct some warm air into the cabin your gyro instruments will thank you (and you'll probably thank yourself - those control yokes are COLD!). The gyros take less of a beating than your engine, and certainly cost less to replace when they wear out, but keeping them happy is worth a little effort.</p>

What's the idea behind this requirement? Is it because random clocks the pilots might carry with them for their flights cannot be trusted?</p>
","<p>The clock needs to be positioned such that you can see it easily as part of your instrument scan, and the sweep second hand needs to be there to make it easy to time intervals that are not whole minutes.</p>

<p>The regulation has been there for a long time, so the requirement should be considered in the light of how things used to be as well as what they are now.</p>

<p>A very practical example from 1969 follows. The regulation predates that by many years, I am sure, but the 1969 environment shows the need.</p>

<p>You're in a light single engine airplane (think Cessna 150 and later a Cessna 172). You're working on your instrument rating in actual conditions in the Pacific Northwest in a non-radar environment. You're in moderate turbulence and having to keep on eye on the icing. And, though it seems ridiculous now, we didn't use headsets but instead picked up a mic for each transmission, of which there were many because in the non-radar environment there were lots of reports.</p>

<p>You're inbound to the VOR on the airport, after which you'll proceed outbound to the NDB that is the final approach fix. Once at the NDB, you will fly 30 seconds farther outbound on the Rwy 16 ILS, which by the way since you have no HSI you're having to navigate by reverse sensing on the old VOR/ILS CDI with its swinging left/right needle. At the 30 second point, you're to turn right to the procedure turn outbound course and fly for 45 seconds (but maybe if that wind is from the east you should go for 60 seconds - better watch that CDI needle to see how fast you get full deflection).</p>

<p>Oh, damn, the instructor just covered up the directional gyro to simulate its failure. Now your only heading reference is the wet compass, which is bouncing around in the turbulence, and, besides, you can't remember whether it's going to precede or lag (and by how much) in the turn you have to make to reverse course for the inbound leg of the procedure turn. Ah, but wait, all you have have to do is fly a standard-rate turn for 60 seconds and you'll be in good shape.</p>

<p>So, thus far, we've had three separate needs to time things to seconds in a situation where we have our hands full - left hand on the yoke, right hand for throttle, carb heat, microphone.</p>

<p>Given all that, do you really want to have to keep pulling back the sleeve on your left arm to monitor a relatively small clock face? Much better to have a larger clock face right in front of you on the instrument panel.</p>

<p>Do we really need such a clock now? Perhaps not, but it doesn't hurt, and regulations are notoriously resistant to change.</p>

What followed was a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3oa2ug/will_pilots_wave_back/cvvlha2"">discussion</a> of whether or not this was a violation of the sterile cockpit rule. Given that waving back is non-essential communication, is this a violation of the FAA sterile cockpi rule? </p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/dd19266cebdac9db852566ef006d346f!OpenDocument"">rgl.faa.gov</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sec. 121.542</p>
  
  <p>Flight crewmember duties.</p>
  
  <p>(a) [I omitted this, it's about noncritical (company) procedures]</p>
  
  <p>(b)
  No flight crewmember may engage in, nor may any pilot in command
  permit, <strong>any activity during a critical phase of flight which could
  distract any flight crewmember</strong> from the performance of his or her
  duties or which could interfere in any way with the proper conduct of
  those duties [...] such as [...] engaging in
  nonessential conversations within the cockpit [...]</p>
  
  <p>(c) For the purposes
  of this section, critical phases of flight includes all ground
  operations <strong>involving taxi</strong>, takeoff and landing, and all other flight
  operations conducted below 10,000 feet, except cruise flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could argue that waving could distract the pilot taxiing, so according to the letter of the law, <strong>yes</strong>, you would violate the rule. </p>

<p>However, I think in the spirit of the rule it's fine, since it just means that the pilot not taxiing is paying attention to the surroundings as well. Reading between the lines, it basically says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) During critical phases of flight, all crew should focus on flying, not selling cooked cardboard</p>
  
  <p>(b) Also, don't read the paper with a croissant while asking help with a crossword during said phases.</p>
  
  <p>(c) Critical phases of flight are when you're likely to read the bumper sticker on another jet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think a quick wave is quite as severe a violation as e.g. reading the paper (or, as the FAA calls it, <em>reading publications not related to the proper conduct of the flight</em>) during take-off. Compare it with a bus driver waving to a fellow driver or one reading the paper while driving. But then, if you do park your plane in a ditch while trying to wave to your mom, don't be surprised to be held fully liable.</p>

"How were pilots selected and trained before the introduction of simulators?","4859","","<p>I wonder, how were the pilots selected and trained before simulators were introduced.</p>

<p>The simulators allowed to test the coordination and reaction time of candidates. And they allowed the students to learn to manipulate the planes before they actually flew. And to train the pilots to work in different situations.</p>

<p>So how was it before the simulators?</p>
","<p>Almost every pilot learns to fly in an actual aircraft, this is one of the reasons all trainers have dual controls.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0dODe.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0dODe.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My first day out, ever, was in an actual plane, behind real controls, in the sky. No sim-time prior to that. The instructor talked me though takeoff and maneuvers (keeping an eye on everything and operating the rudder). All he did was radio coms, navigation and the approach/landing.   </p>

<p>As for whats common: </p>

<p>The vast majority of American WWII pilots are said to have learned to fly in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_J-3_Cub"" rel=""noreferrer"">piper J-3 Cub</a>

<a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/training-day-180954059/"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Boeing PT-17 Steraman and AT-11 Kansan were also popular.</a> </p>

<p>In GA where everyone else gets their start the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee"" rel=""noreferrer"">Piper Cherokee</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_150"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cessna 150</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172"" rel=""noreferrer"">172</a> rule supreme. </p>

<p>Of course these planes are slow, benign and fairly safe by aviation standards. But what if you have some super fast, one of a kind, high flying, awesome supersonic jet gadget. You surely cant afford to ruin such a plane but still need to train pilots. Well in that case you just <a href=""https://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Movie/SR-71/HTML/EM-0025-07.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">build yourself a dual cockpit custom trainer</a>.... </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Training_Aircraft"" rel=""noreferrer"">Even the space shuttle had a real flying trainer</a> designed to mimic its approach characteristics. </p>

"What's the purpose of yawing?","4854","","<p>I've never understood the purpose of yawing, i.e., rotating around the vertical axis by activating the rudder. Provided that airplanes have ailerons that allow banking (used for turning), why do they actually need to yaw? Furthermore, I've read that yawing induces an undesired banking because of the different lifts generated by each wing, due to the fact that one wing ""feels"" a higher airspeed than the other (a similar effect as a car's wheel spinning faster than the other during a turn). So, if yawing is so ""useless"" or bothering, why do airplanes have rudders? Moreover, could an airplane takeoff, fly and land without rudder?</p>
","<p>From a totally practical standpoint, let's say you're in a small tricycle gear aircraft with a freely castoring nose wheel (or a tail dragger) and you're starting your takeoff roll in a calm wind. When you bring the power up, the aircraft is going to want to turn left (<a href=""http://wiki.flightgear.org/Understanding_Propeller_Torque_and_P-Factor"" rel=""nofollow"">why is another question</a>), in other words to yaw about its vertical axis in a counter-clockwise direction, and head for the grass off the left side of the runway. You counteract that adverse yaw by using right rudder to keep the airplane straight. Initially you might have to use some right brake as well until there's sufficient air moving past the rudder. If you had a steerable nose gear, you wouldn't need the right brake.</p>

<p>You reach flying speed, apply up elevator, and lift off. As the airplane rotates about its lateral axis, there'll be some additional adverse yaw as a result of that rotation (again another question). Even if you had a steerable nose gear, that would now be useless as the nose gear is no longer on the ground. Your means of continuing to fly straight ahead is to counter the adverse yaw with rudder, and you would continue to use right rudder as you climb out. If you don't, you'll start turning left.</p>

<p>You reach the altitude you want, level off, and trim for level flight straight ahead. Then you decide you want to turn left. You start the turn briskly with left aileron, but you forgot to use any rudder. If you were looking at the ball on the bottom of the turn and bank indicator, you would see it shoot left. If you had used left rudder while initiating the turn, that wouldn't have happened. You would have started a coordinated turn.</p>

<p>Now you're coming back to the airport, and there's a crosswind from the left. You decide you want to counter that crosswind by slipping into it. In other words, you want the airplane to travel sideways at a speed that matches the crosswind while still having your nose pointing straight down the runway. So, you lower the left wing and to keep the airplane from turning, you use right rudder to keep the airplane aligned with the runway. You match the crosswind by adding or decreasing your bank.</p>

<p>There are other uses of rudder, and especially in aerobatics.</p>

<p>I once flew a few loads of skydivers. The jumpmaster sat behind me, and to help him in positioning for the drop zone, he wanted flat turns. In other words, he wanted the airplane turned while keeping the wings level. So, if he wanted a left turn, that meant left rudder and right aileron. Uncomfortable from a pilot's standpoint.</p>

<p>Finally, back in the 1960s when I was working on my instrument rating, I had an instructor who taught that the best way to track a localizer in close was to use rudder only for small corrections. Personally, I don't like that method, but it's one way of doing things.</p>

<p>A useful thing, the rudder. You need to be able to directly control movement about all three aircraft axes.</p>
