"How can I tell which size chain my bike uses?","276732","","<p>After learning how to break a chain and reattach it, and also how to add and remove a master link, I find that I can now do much more in the way of maintenance at home. I'll no longer need to bring my bikes into the shop simply for a new chain... if I can only figure out how to identify what size chain I'll need to order. </p>

<p>Is there a simple way of telling what size and type of chain I'll need to order to replace the chain on a bike? Do I measure the chain links? Count links? Count gears on the cogs? </p>

<p>If it helps, some of my bikes' drivetrains have internal hubs, some have derailer gears. </p>
","<p>If you are using a bike with a derailleur the number of cogs on the rear hub will determine the chain size you will need.  They are always 3/32"" chains.</p>

<p>You can get a 5/6/7-speed, 8-speed, 9-speed, or 10-speed chains.</p>

<p>If you can't find a chain that matches your cluster pick a chain for a larger number, for example if you have an eight-cog cluster you can use a eight, nine or ten-speed chain, but you shouldn't use a 6 or 7-speed chain.</p>

<p>Internally geared hubs will have their own specification for the size chain they require, and single-speed, fixie, BMX bikes, and probably some older bikes use 1/8"" chains.</p>

"Why ride a single-speed bike?","195831","","<p>A question came up recently about <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1980/why-ride-a-fixed-gear-bike"">why people ride fixed-gear bikes</a>. I think you can't reasonably answer that question without first understanding why people ride <strong>single-speed</strong> bikes.</p>

<p>So, why do they do it?</p>
","<p>I ride a single-speed (as opposed to fixed gear) because I like to be able to coast down a hill without worrying about spinning out, or hitting a pot-hole while frantically trying to keep up with my pedals. Don't get me wrong, I love riding fixed-gear, but for where I live it's just a little impractical to not be able to coast.</p>

<p>I ride a single-speed (as opposed to a geared bike) for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>A: It's all I could afford. If you only have $600, you'll get a lot more bike with a single-speed than a geared bike.  Or rather, you'll get a lighter bike with better hubs/wheels/etc than for a $600 geared bike. Someday I'll have the money for a decent road bike (105/Rival or better) and will buy one. But for now, my single-speed is much lighter and sturdier than any $600 geared road bike I could have gotten.</p>

<p>B: I enjoy the simplicity. Want to go faster? Pedal faster.</p>

<p>C: I enjoy the workout. I live in Utah, where there are some pretty big hills/mountains. The only way to get to the top is to (as my dad used to say) hunker down and gut it out. There's something quite invigorating about knowing you conquered that hill with the power in your legs instead of the mechanical advantage of your gear ratio.</p>

<p>D: Even on the freewheel side of my hub, my single-speed is <em>quiet</em>. No gears means that unless I'm coasting, my bike is nearly silent.</p>

"Converting bike from rim brakes to disc brakes","190527","","<p>I just bought a used <a href=""http://www.konaworld.com/09/09_dew_en.cfm"">2009 Kona Dew</a> and it comes with regular rim brakes. I'm perfectly happy with them so far, but have been wondering if disc brakes would come handy when it rains.</p>

<p>What is involved in converting a bike from rim brakes to disc brakes (mechanical or hydraulic)? </p>

<p>Is this something that is feasible, or am I better off buying another bike that already has disc brakes?</p>
","<p>Your frame and fork already have disc tabs, which is the first step.  The second is a disc wheelset, which it does not appear that the stock wheels are.  Disc hubs come in <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/4425#4425"">two varieties</a>: the common six-bolt ISO and the proprietary Shimano Centerlock, the former are identifiable by a large six-bolt-hole protrusion on the left (non-drive) side of the bike.  The latter have a rubber cover over a smaller splined mount.</p>

<p>Once a new wheelset is selected, you'll need a set of calipers and disc rotors.  The Avid BB7 is a popular mechanical disc caliper, and will work with your existing linear-pull brake levers.</p>

<p>Installation is fairly straightforward, but since it involves braking it's worth involving a professional if you're at all in doubt of your mechanical aptitude.  The disc rotors bolt to the wheel, the calipers to the frame.  The old v-brakes are removed.  New cables and housing are routed from the levers to the calipers and the calipers are adjusted.</p>

<p>Cost-wise, if you're happy with the bicycle otherwise it's not a poor investment - good wheels and brakes can be moved to future bikes if you later decide to upgrade the frame.  The ideal time would be to consider when the wheels already need to be replaced due to wear, since the new wheelset will represent the majority of the upgrade cost.</p>

"How to inflate a tire with a Presta valve?","188021","","<p>My new bike has these thin tires with a type of valve I haven't usedbefore. I searched online and found out it's called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presta_valve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Presta valve</a>, and it's pretty common and popular. I'm finding it annoying and fiddly and don't know how to use it properly. I have a floor pump, and I know the valves and pump are fine, because the guy in the shop had no trouble using the same one. But after reading online and watching YouTube videos I still can't figure out how to do it properly!  </p>

<p>Here's what I'm trying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rotate wheel so that the pump can comfortably reach the valve (guides online say the valve should be at 12 o'clock position, but I can't do that because the hose on the pump isn't long enough)</li>
<li>Remove valve cap, unscrew thingy in valve, and tap it a little - a jet of air shoots out. OK.</li>
<li>Push pump onto valve. This is where I get into trouble...</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't seem to get the attachment onto the valve in the right way. I'm pushing it on with the elbow lever thingy down, and then pulling the lever up as you can see in the pictures, to make the attachment grip onto the valve.  </p>

<p>Now, either it flops around loose and leaks air out the sides (when I push it on gently), or sometimes it goes on but then the tire doesn't seem to inflate any, the pump just gets stiff really quickly as if the valve was blocked - then I remove the attachment and it goes pffffft like all the pressure was just backed up in the hose and not actually going into the tire.</p>

<p>I was able to pump up the tire eventually, but it took me about an hour of stuffing around and my ""project manager"" got angry, because I was supposed to be in the kitchen making her a salad, not mucking around in the garage.  </p>

<p>The time I got it on properly I had to deflate the tire completely, and even then it was difficult because with the tire completely deflated the stem of the valve just pushed into the rim. Surely this is not normal? What's the trick of attaching the darned thing?</p>

<p>Also, how can I just check the pressure? When I attach the thing I expect the guage to jump up and show me what pressure it's at, but it just stays at 0.  The tires say on the side to inflate to 110&nbsp;psi (7.5&nbsp;atm), but my pump only goes up to 100.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQbMl.jpg"" alt=""Enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Those valve stems are too short for those deep deep rims you've got on there. You can tell just from the photos that the valve stem isn't sticking out far enough from the rim for the pump to fit all the way on it. Hence, it's not contacting the valve enough for you to inflate your tires.</p>

"Why ride a fixed-gear bike?","184859","","<p>I must confess, I don't know much about bikes.  Until fairly recently, a bike was just that thing that I rode to work each day.  I've been slowly learning more about bikes but I still have some newbie questions.  This is one of them.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly and have got the terminology correct, a fixed-gear bike is a bike with only one gear (so you can't change it) and no freewheel (so if the rear wheel is turning, so are the pedals).</p>

<p>Why do people ride fixed-gear bikes?  Isn't it either hard to get started (if fixed in a high gear ratio) or hard to get to a good speed (if fixed in a low gear ratio)?</p>

<p>I'm not trying to insult or flame riders of fixed-gear bikes - I'm just curious! :)</p>
","<p>Your understanding is correct. </p>

<p><strong>Why do people ride them?</strong> Some random answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Maintenance is very, very low. You have to keep the tires and chain in good working order and, on a bike you ride on the road, hopefully some form of a brake. That's it.</li>
<li>On most velodromes, you have to ride a fixed gear bike, so if you race track, you have no choice.</li>
<li>There is something to be said for how a fixed gear will force you to develop a smoother pedaling style since you simply cannot stop. Due to this, they are somewhat popular for 'off season' training by serious road cyclists.</li>
<li>(Hesitating to mention this...) There is a certain segment of the population that loves retro and simple things. In addition to being possibly the most efficient people moving device that exists, the fixed gear bicycle can be an important fashion accessory.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hard to get started/Hard to go fast?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Generally someone who has a road worthy fixie will have selected a gear that works well for the terrain and speed that they like to ride at. I've only ridden fixed gear bikes on the track, but I'd imagine for a city fixie, you'd optimize for a fairly low speed but someone who takes these more seriously can answer better.</p>

"What is a reasonable speed for long distances on a bike?","169894","","<p>I am curious what a reasonable speed to travel on a bike is.  Speed will obviously vary based on the conditions in which you are riding.  I am planning on taking the GPS out with me this weekend to see how quickly I go.  Before I did that I wanted to get some benchmarks.</p>

<p>For the most part I will be riding an older road bike on crushed rock.  (Very small rock, with good rolling resistance but still much worse than pavement).  </p>

<p>I will also be riding that road bike on the road (i.e.: pavement in North America, Tarmac in Great Britain).</p>

<p>What is a reasonable speed on these two surfaces?  I am more interested in speed over long distances, i.e. if you were going 80 km what would your target speed be?</p>
","<p>Speed varies widely by cyclist, depending on fitness, road conditions and traffic.  Some of my observations (cruising speed based on a flat, paved road in good condition):</p>

<ul>
<li>20km/h (12.4 mph) - many ""occasional"" cyclists ride around this speed</li>
<li>25km/h (15.5 mph) - most commuters</li>
<li>30km/h (18.6 mph) - fast commuters, slower roadies</li>
<li>35km/h (21.7 mph) - fast roadies</li>
<li>any faster than that on a long flat and they're probably a racer</li>
</ul>

<p>(based on who I pass and who passes me when riding around 30km/h)</p>

<p>Average speed will usually be slower than you think, once traffic stops and hills are factored in, especially over longer distances (like 80km).  On my 21km commute I'll hit 30+ on every long stretch I can, but my average still only works out to 24km/h.  For longer rides I cruise around 27-28 km/h, which is more sustainable; averaging 22-24 over a very long ride (200km) is a great pace for me.</p>

"What pressure should I run my Road Bike tyres at?","160659","","<p>There's a question for mountain bike tyres but I can't seem to find anything on here for road bikes. At the moment I'm running at around 90psi. Is that too much? too little?  Also, am I more likely to get punctures running at higher pressure?  I seem to be getting a lot lately. </p>
","<p>All other things being equal, run them as high as the tyre manufacturer recommends (there will be an advisory notice on the tyre wall). For most tyres of even medium quality, this should be at least 100psi, if not 110; higher end tyres might go up to 130+. (I generally inflate both tyres to similar pressures, but I think that there are some theories that if either were to be higher, that should be the rear, because it carries the majority of the weight.) </p>

<p>Indeed, the higher the pressure and the harder the tyre, the fewer punctures you should expect as the surface should be better at repelling objects. </p>

<p>You should keep tyres topped up, natural leakage occurs and at the higher pressures you might expect 10-20 psi drift within a week. </p>

<p>When re-inflating, you should also take the opportunity to inspect the tyres. Any deformity or wear will be sure to be far more obvious and damaging when the tyre is inflated to the limits of its recommended pressure. </p>

<p>The only caveat is in poor weather, where a reduction in pressure increases the contact area and introduces give, which should make for enhanced traction. </p>

"Creaking from cranks/spindle. How to fix?","158811","","<p>Recently the cranks on my bike started to creak.
I checked with my usual ""bike-bible"" <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/repair/readhowto.asp?id=123"">Park Tool</a>. They recommended dis-assemble, lubricate, re-assemble.</p>

<p>So I did that.</p>

<p>Remove cranks.
Remove spindle.
Clean.
Lubricate.
Reassemble.</p>

<p>No, the creak is still there.</p>

<p>(To find out the source-area of the sound I had a friend riding the bike slowly while I ran alongside listening. And the sound where coming from the area of the bottom bracket/cranks. I am happy no neighbor saw me...) </p>

<p>For each revelation of the cranks there are two creak-noises. 
If I, when on the bike, push down with both feet I hear a noise. Turn 180 degrees without pressure, push down again and there is the noise again.
If I am ""too soft"", low pressure there are no sound.
Since I have clips I have tried to only work with one foot to keep a constant load during a revelation, there where no detectable sound then.</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea what is wrong on the bike?
And how I should fix it?</p>

<p>/Leif</p>
","<p>There are many possible causes of creaking. But Deemar has the most likely reason in this case - the cranks are loose on the axle. Think about how a creak is produced. It's one item sliding over another. But instead of sliding it's repeatedly sticking then jumping. The amount of movement might only be a fraction of a millimetre. The OP would have noticed if the cranks were really loose. But in this case the looseness may be at the microscopic scale. </p>

<p>You can easily test this without having to run alongside the bike. Get on the bike with the brakes on and your shoulder against a wall. Rotate the pedals so the cranks are horizontal and bounce up and down with your weight equally on both pedals. This twists the cranks and axle as far as possible in one direction. Then rotate the pedals to a position 180 degrees from that (the other foot forward) and do the same. This twists the assembly as far as possible the other way. Repeat the procedure listening all the while for creaks. Testing in this way avoids many other sources of noise such as wheels, chain, seat, etc. Take care. If something breaks or your foot slips off the pedal you'll hurt yourself. </p>

<p>When new the cranks have a square tapered hole which fits exactly onto the tapered square on the axle. As Deemar says, if it has been wobbling for a while the hole will be damaged and you may never get a satisfactory fit. On my bike I fixed it (at least for now) by carefully reshaping the inside of the square holes with a file and cleaning the square shaft on the axle. Then I assembled it with grease. To get the parts to bed in together I applied the following procedure repeatedly. Bash the crank a few times with a soft hammer. Bounce up and down on the pedals as above. Retighten the bolt. Eventually the soft aluminium crank took up the shape of the hard axle and the creaking was completely eliminated. You will probably need to do this for both cranks. </p>

<p>Remember that the amount of movement between the crank and axle may be so small it's imperceptible. You may not see it moving. But you will be hear the result when you do the pedal bouncing test. On my bike the noise was really loud and infuriating and now it's completely silent. I will re-tighten the bolt periodically. If it loosens again I may have to replace the cranks and bottom bracket. </p>

<p>The crucial point he makes on the video is that the tire bead doesn't stretch and is the limiting factor in getting the tire on. Thus you need to push the bead into the well of the rim on the sides opposite to the last bit you're trying to get on. Doing this gives you the room you need to get the last bit on.<br>
The extra room will make it easier and you will be less likely to pinch the tube. You can use straps to hold the tire in place if you need to.</p>

"Frame sizing: ""medium"" vs. inches vs. centimeters","147818","","<p>How in the world does 17-18 inches match up to 53-54 cm?? </p>

<p>I was looking up bicycle sizing charts and found the ones on the Evans website interesting, if somewhat confusing. For example, see the chart for Hybrid frame sizes: <a href=""http://www.evanscycles.com/help/bike-sizing#hybrid"">http://www.evanscycles.com/help/bike-sizing#hybrid</a></p>

<p>Looking at the suggested frame sizes, I guess I don't understand how the inches vs. centimetres match up. A frame size of 17-18 inches or ""M"" is listed as being equivalent to a frame size of or 53-54 cm, however, a simple conversion shows that 17-18 inches is roughly equal to 43-46 cm. Strange! </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Essentially, bicycle frame sizing is inconsistent and possibly insane. <strong>Try the bikes out. Don't rely on a single number for the size.</strong></p>

<p>Theoretically the size given is the length of the seat tube, but there's a lot of inconsistency in how that's measured.</p>

<p>Usually a frame size given in inches is a mountain bike frame and a frame size given in centimeters is a road bike. A mountain bike frame will have a higher bottom bracket in order to clear obstacles better, and may also have a lower seat tube (to lessen the odds of your crotch colliding with it when dealing with rough terrain), so you can't simply convert one number to the other. If you look on that chart and compare the ""hybrid"" sizes to the ""road"" and ""mountain"" sizes you'll see that hybrid cm is close to road cm and hybrid inches is close to mountain inches.</p>

<p>Even within a single basic bike type there can be a fair amount of difference in the bottom bracket height, which directly affects standover height.</p>

<p>Basically, mountain bikes and road bikes have two different sizings and you need to find out the appropriate size for you in each. Hybrids seem to sometimes be sized like road bikes or like mountain bikes, but the frame geometry probably doesn't really quite match up to either style of bike and they may report the sizing as what matches the other style or as the actual measurement. There's a lot of variation in hybrid geometries because there's a lot of different sub-types of hybrid intended for different kinds of riders.</p>

<p>Because the manufacturers aren't consistent, you really need to <strong>try the bikes out</strong> to find the right size bike. Two bikes of the same basic type may be the exact same height but have different top-tube lengths and therefore fit you differently. If you're an experienced rider you might be able to work out what you need to know for a bike given the full geometry information that many manufacturers publish, but the single number size will never be enough.</p>

"Hydraulic Vs. Mechanical disc brakes","141815","","<p>What is the difference between hydraulic and mechanical disc brakes? Are hydraulics more reliable? Or more powerful? I'm curious since, hydraulics seem to get more attention and seem to be on professional bikes. </p>
","<p>Hydraulics are used on higher end systems, cables are often a sign of a cheap brake set, so your observations are correct regarding ""professional"" bikes. However there are very good cable disc brakes (e.g. Avid BB7's) that are the exception that proves the rule. . </p>

<p>Cables have the disadvantage of friction that hydraulics virtually eliminate. It is significantly easier to modulate hydraulic brakes, you get more force delivered to the pads, hence more stopping power for the same input, and faster/more reliable and predictable pad retraction when releasing the brakes. 
As the Hydraulic system is sealed, grit and grime cannot get in to jam up the moving bits, making them virtually maintenance free (replace worn pads is about all need doing)
Hydraulic systems are also easier to set up and adjust (with the right tools - next to impossible without them). Cables have to the exact length, and need ""tweaking"" as they stretch from new.  </p>

<p>That said - a good quality and well maintained cable system will out perform a poor quality, cheap hydraulic brake set, so you cannot state ""Its hydraulic therefore it's better"".  </p>

<p>Disadvantages of hydraulics occur when you get a leak such as hole in a hose or blown seal. They are less ""field serviceable"" than cables, essentially the brake is rendered useless and unrepairable (in the field) by a minor fault - which fortunately happens very rarely, and usually caused by poor transport rather than while out riding. </p>

<p>Another reported problem with hydraulics is boiling of fluid. This is more of a problem on road bikes where mountain descents of 100's of vertical meters in a very short time are more common. With overheated fluid initially the pressure in the system stops the fluid boiling. When the brake is released (even for a moment), the pressure comes off and fluid boils, and the brakes no longer work - at all - the lever just goes all the way in. Another thing that can happen is the rider stops with no problems, but the heat in the calliper (no longer being cooled by airflow) migrates to the fluid over the next few minutes, so when the rider rides off there are no brakes.  (This is different to disc fade where the pads and disc overheat and brakes loss effectiveness slowly - both types suffer this equally.) </p>

"Can I use a gas station pump on a bike tire?","124983","","<p>Someone pointed out that it may be risky, and it might not have the right kind of nozzle, but I don't have a bike pump at the moment.  Does anyone else ever do this?</p>
","<p>The answer, in short is: Can you? In some cases, yes. Should you? In most cases, no.</p>

<p>The long answer: The reason you <em>can</em> sometimes use an automotive air-pump on a bicycle tire/tube is because they share an identical valve. (See: <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/284#284"">Schrader valve/Schrader tube</a> in the <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index"">Terminology Index</a>). If you have this type, you will definitely be able to get air into your tubes in a pinch. However, air hoses from gas stations are usually unregulated, high-pressure &amp; high-volume, and lack a pressure gauge. Therefore, it is much easier to over-inflate and even blow out your bicycle tire, if you were to use one.</p>

<p>An investment in a bicycle pump is one of the best you can make as a cyclist. Not only will it get you out of situations like this, but it will make it easier to keep your tires at the recommended pressure rating, which in turn will make it easier for you to be a more efficient (read: faster) bicyclist.</p>

"How to calculate the capacity of a rear derailleur","117966","","<p>It's easy to calculate what capacity of a rear derailleur will be needed based on the size of the big and small chainring and the big and small cog. What about the converse question, how to calculate the capacity of a derailleur?</p>

<p>I was comparing some short-cage rear derailleurs I have lying around, and I noticed that the cage length and pulley sizes varied enough that they probably had different capacities.</p>

<p>Related question: is there a fairly comprehensive place to look these up?</p>
","<p>If you are asking how to calculate the maximum capacity of the chainrings and cogs, based on looking at the derailleur, then it's not going to be as easy as just looking at them.</p>

<p>Finding a derailleur to fit your chainrings/cogs based on just the chainrings/cogs is going to be a lot easier than finding chainrings based on looking at your derailleur. HOWEVER, there are some standards for manufacturer, I have listed them below. I have also included the formula to find out your capacities, since I misread your question initially and decided to answer the part you weren't concerned with. I am not deleting it because, well, it took a while to type.</p>

<p>According to United Bicycle Institute:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Determine <strong>Maximum Chainring Difference</strong> by subracting the number of teeth in the smallest chainring from the number of teeth in the largest chainring</p></li>
<li><p>Determine <strong>Maximum Cassette Cog Difference</strong> by subtracting the number of teeth on the smallest cassette cog from the number of teeth on the largest cassette cog</p></li>
<li><p>Determine <strong>Total Drivetrain Capacity</strong> by adding <strong>Maximum Chainring Difference</strong> to the <strong>Maximum Cassette Cog Difference</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Record the <strong>Maximum Cassette Cog</strong> (the number of teeth on the largest Cassette Cog)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>For Shimano:</strong></p>

<p>SS - Short Cage Road Double - <strong>Maximum Cassette Cog</strong> is 27 and <strong>Total Capacity</strong> is 29</p>

<p>GS - Medium Cage MTB/Road Triple - <strong>Maximum Cassette Cog</strong> is 34(MTB)/27(Road) and <strong>Total Capacity</strong> is 33(MTB)/37(Road)</p>

<p>SGS - Long MTB - <strong>Maximum Cassette Cog</strong> is 34 and <strong>Total Capacity</strong> is 45</p>

"Why would one ever buy a 12-25 cassette when an 11-25 is available?","116868","","<p>I was looking at purchasing a new cassette and chain. Looking at the available cassettes for SRAM components, there is a big variety of sizes available:</p>

<li>11-28: 11-12-13-14-15-17-19-22-25-28</li>
<li>11-32: 11-12-13-15-17-19-22-25-28-32</li>
<li>12-25: 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21-23-25</li>
<li>12-26: 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21-23-26</li>
<li>12-27: 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21-24-27</li>
<li>12-28: 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-22-25-28</li>
<li>12-32: 12-13-14-15-17-19-22-25-28-32</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I can understand why someone would choose a cassette based off of how many teeth the big gear has. Some people live in hilly or mountainous areas and desire a higher number of teeth. Some people live in flat areas where they simply won't use those cassettes with a lot of teeth on the big gear.</p>

<p>But why would anyone ever choose to buy a cassette with 12 teeth on the small gear instead of 11? 11 teeth = higher maximum speed. I doubt many people buying a nice set of components (Shimano, SRAM etc) would ever say ""I don't need to go faster so 12 teeth is fine with me.""</p>

<p>What's the point of 12 teeth when you could opt for 11 instead?</p>
","<p>If you want to maximize your max. speed, go for an 11 tooth cog. If you want to maximize your average speed, unless you're a pro you probably are better off without it. Even cruising at 40km/h does not require and 11 tooth cog.</p>

<p>For example, take a look at this table, showing cruising speeds for a 11- 21 tooth cassette:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YqRHV.png"" alt=""cruising speeds for a 11- 21 tooth cassette""></p>

<p>And compare to this table for a 12 - 25 tooth cassette:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MrN6P.png"" alt=""cruising speeds for a 11- 25 tooth cassette""></p>

<p>You can see that the 11 tooth cog is only really useful for cruising speeds that riders at the professional level can maintain, or for short bursts. So, like I said, if you aren't trying to break your own max speed record, you may be better off with a 12 tooth cog.</p>

","<p>This fork setting exists so that the fork can be customized to your weight (major reason) and riding style (minor reason). It's simply the initial compression of the internal spring in the fork. The more it's compressed, the stiffer the fork will feel.</p>

<p>Bigger preload compresses the spring more, and so it's best for heavier riders and/or people who need/prefer the stiffer ride (racers etc.)  Lighter riders should use less(-) preload. Less(-) preload will also give you plusher ride, but the bike will e.g. dive more during braking.</p>

<p>Sorry if this has been asked (but I cannot find it by searching) and I also just cannot think of a reason why.</p>
","<p>Way back when safety bike were becoming popular women wore skirts. Skirt lengths were to the ankle. The dropped top bar made getting on possible while maintaining resectability. Women were considered to fragile to risk hitting the top tube hence the slanted bar. The trend continued even long after women stopped riding in long skirts. Modern WSD (women specific design) geometry differs from conventional bike geometry. The difference goes beyond just size. Whether it is needed depends on who you ask. While some women may be smaller than the average male many are as tall, height is not the only issue. Many women have a different leg to torso ratio than the male average and the frames are built to fit that difference. This is not to say that a women needs a female specific frame or that a male wouldn't fit on a WSD frame. It all depends on the individual physical traits of the rider.   </p>

"How do on-road mountain bike speeds translate to road bike speeds?","106447","","<p>When cycling on roads on my mountain bike, I generally get around 10-12 miles per hour on a flat surface.</p>

<p>What sort of speeds can I expect to get on a road bike?</p>
","<p>On my reasonably flat commute I average around 16 mph on my road bike, but your average speed is dependent on many different factors. A general rule of thumb is that <strong>if you are switching from a mountain bike with knobbies to a road bike you will be between 15-20% faster at the same watts/effort.</strong>  Typically that's only a change of 2-3 mph.</p>

<p>I teach a bike commuting workshop, and one of the most common questions is whether to switch from a mountain bike to a road bike in order to increase speed.  Typically, I tell people to <strong>try three things first</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Swap out your knobby tires for high pressure slicks.  You can find 1.25"" -1.5"" slick tires that fit mountain bike rims and run at between 75 - 90 lbs of pressure. These will dramatically reduce rolling resistance.</li>
<li>If you have a suspension either lock it out, or set it as stiff as you can.  Locking out your suspension will cause more of your effort to be transferred directly through the drive-train and translate into less loss of momentum from shock absorption.</li>
<li>Try clipless pedals.  Your pedal stroke will be more efficient, again resulting in an increase in speed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do those three things the only real differences between a road bike and your mountain bike will be the weight (which matters a lot more when accelerating than it does when you are already rolling) and surface area resistance from riding in the drops.  But most road bikers don't spend much time in the drops.</p>

<p>Finally, your weight and fitness make a huge difference.  I frequently pass road bike riders while on my commuter rigid frame mountain bike with high pressure slicks.</p>

  <p>Handlebars will be mounted parallel to the ground or angled slightly upward.

The brake levers will preferably be mounted such that the end of the brake lever is even with the bottom of the bar.  Modern bars, however, dictate that this may not always be possible, so tolerances are permitted within reason. Brake hoods should not approach anything near 45 degrees, as some riders with poor taste have been insisting on doing.</p>

"How can I check tire pressure without a pressure gauge?","93864","","<p>I would like to tell if my tires are correctly inflated, in this case road tires, but I do not have a pressure gauge.</p>

<p>Is there a handy heuristic for checking the pressure? Could I do it, for example, by trying to squeeze the tire between two fingers and seeing how easily it gives? (I can do that anyway, but it wouldn't give me any idea about the pressure level.)</p>
","<p>Unless you have got correctly inflated tyres then you do not know what you are missing. No rule of thumb can make up for this. Tyre inflation is really important and your best bet is to get a track pump with valve to check your tyres with. Do this every fortnight, leave it to every month if your journey times are not important to you. I cannot stress enough the importance of getting a track pump, however, that is not what you asked.</p>

<p>Several answers here have mentioned that you should take a peek at how much your tyres splay when you are riding the bike. This is definitely a useful check, however you must bear in mind that a correctly inflated tyre is not a solid tyre and it will bulge out sideways anyway. Only when drastically under-inflated will it show an easily discernible extra bulge. But do watch for that, particularly if you go over a bump and the bike 'thuds' more than normal.</p>

<p>There is also the ride-through-the-puddle test. Go through a puddle and onto a dry surface, e.g. a pavement or a hallway. If you look at how much water has been left behind you can get a comparative idea of how much of your tyre is in contact with the road. If you know what you expect and if the trail is thicker than that, e.g. with a lot more than the centre ridge making contact, then you may want to get the track pump out again.</p>

<p>Returning to the weight-on-the-wheel and how much the tyres splay idea, you can also roll your bike slowly over a kerb and see how much it deforms. At speed it will do so more than under the static situation, so try it slowly and there should be no danger to your rims and 'snake-biting' your tyres.</p>

<p>As for squeezing the tyre after inflating it as best as I can with a mini-pump, when I get to the track pump with gauge I am always surprised at how many tens of P.S.I. I was off the mark. Squeezing the tyre is a waste of time.</p>

<p>If you had car-type valves (which you don't) then you could get those valve caps that some car-part shops sell. These go red when you lose 5-10 P.S.I. They are good but not available in Presta to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Personally I find the best gauge to be how the bike feels and how fast it goes. On some parts of my commute I like to go quicker than the 20 m.p.h. speed limit (as cars cannot over take me then), however, there are times when I am not able to hit my expected speeds, as measured on the bike speedometer. With a bit of extra air in the tyres I can usually get back to where I expect to be.</p>

","<h1>250-260 pounds isn't that heavy.</h1>

<p>You may not need to worry about weight at all.</p>

<p>See if you can find the information from the manufacturer about weight limits for their bikes. For a mountain bike that you intend to use for what it was made for, you're probably within the weight limit the bike is designed for.</p>

<p>You may want to avoid the lightest weight stuff (carbon) unless you check the weight specs. But that's mostly stuff on the more expensive bikes.</p>

<p>Some of the parts that normally wear out will likely wear out faster for you than for somebody lighter, but that's no big deal.</p>

<p>If you plan to do tougher things with the bike than it was made for (jump a trail bike, for instance) you could run into problems. Stick with getting a bike that's intended for what you plan to do with the bike.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

"What is the downside to me purchasing a road bike instead of a hybrid?","91006","","<p>I'm about to move to a place closer to my work where I'll be able to ride to and from the office (9km ride each way). </p>

<p>I'm not super fit but I occasionally ride to work from where I'm living now which is a 14km commute on an old mountain bike with some thinner tyres fitted. I need a change of clothes for those rides.</p>

<p>I figured with the move, it's a good opportunity to get into riding. I plan on riding every day and me and my gf may even sell one of our cars eventually.</p>

<p>Which is why I'm thinking I need a real bike. I'm a little torn between getting a hybrid commuting bike or a road bike.</p>

<p>My brain tells me a hybrid is much more practical but I tried a road bike the other day (only in a car park), and it just seems SO much lighter and smoother. In terms of the handle bars, it was awkward but I think I could get used to it.</p>

<p>So yeah, if I pick a road bike where I can stick a rack on, should I just go ahead and buy a road bike instead of a hybrid? Is there anything a hybrid will offer me that a road bike will not? How do road bikes handle when they have racks?</p>
","<p>The real answer is that for a 9km ride, virtually any bike will do the trick. It's hard to be uncomfortable on a bike (that fits you) for that short of a ride.</p>

<p>However, I'm fully in the road bike camp on this question. Hybrids are, in my opinion, a compromise with no real benefits. Most people aren't going to ride them off-road (and most road bikes can deal with short periods of offroad travel without problems). Cushioned saddles look great to novices, but divert weight away from your <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/saddles.html#hardsoft"">sit bones</a> and are all but guaranteed to be uncomfortable should you decide to ride longer distances (for this reason, I can't recommend leather saddles highly enough, particularly Brooks'). The knobby tires that come standard on most hybrids have poor road  handling characteristics, and actually result in less traction on the road in wet conditions (bicycles <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tires.html#hydroplaning"">cannot hydroplane</a>).</p>

<p>On the contrary, a properly setup road commuter will offer you more hand positions via the drop handlebars (on the flats, the hoods, and drops) compared to just one. This will be <em>invaluable</em> for longer rides where your hands fatigue from maintaining one position. They can come with wider non-racing tires (I commute on 28C <a href=""http://www.roadbikereview.com/cat/wheels/tires-clincher/panaracer/ribmo/prd_411353_2489crx.aspx"">Panaracer Ribmo</a> tires, and haven't had a flat in over 10,000km). And appropriate commuting frames come with rack and pannier bosses, and many will have racks preinstalled.</p>

<p>So while a hybrid bike will work, an appropriately-equipped road bike would be <em>better</em> in that it will be able to adapt to your needs should find yourself wanting to ride longer distances or join faster group rides.</p>

","<p>Tire pressure is generally a trade-off between three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rolling resistance (more pressure == rolls easier)</li>
<li>Pinch flat resistance (more pressure == less chance for the tube to tear when a rock squashes the tire toward the rim)</li>
<li>Grip (with less pressure, the tire can conform better to rocks, roots, and other terrain giving a larger contact surface)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are riding terrain where grip isn't too much of an issue (flat or low-angle dirt and dry rocks for example), then higher pressure will keep you going fast without pinch flatting.</p>

<p>If you are riding steep downhills and/or on slippery open rock outcroppings, grip will be more important than rolling resistance, so use as little pressure as won't pinch-flat quickly.</p>

<p>There is a 4th trade-off as well: weight. You can buy double-sidewall downhill tires that allow you to run very low pressures (such as 25psi) without any danger of pinch-flatting, but these can weigh almost double what normal cross-country tires do.</p>

<p>As mentioned in other answers, your tires don't have to be the same pressure. Usually grip is more important on the front tire since most of your weight is on it while descending difficult downhill sections. Similarly, when riding on flat or climbing, most of your weight is over the back tire, so rolling resistance and pinch-flat resistance are more important for the back. </p>

<p>I personally ride with a low-pressure (30psi in a tire rated 35-65psi) double-sidewall downhill tire on the front and with a higher pressure (50psi in a tire rated 45-65psi) cross-country tire on the rear. I sacrifice some weight, but otherwise get the best of both worlds: fabulous grip going down and easy rolling on the flats and climbs.</p>

<p>Use your best judgment in going below the rated pressure of the tire, as pinch flats become more likely. If you go below the rated pressure, be sure to test it out on hard impacts (such as a rock-corner) on easy terrain before throwing yourself at high speed down a mountain where a blow-out would be catastrophic.</p>

"Difference between Cyclocross, Touring, and Road Bikes?","85346","","<p>My question is ""What is the difference between Cyclocross, Touring, and Road Bikes? Also what are their intended uses (their place in the cycle 'community'?)""</p>

<p>I have looked at <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/15562/what-is-the-difference-between-race-road-and-cx-bikes"">What is the difference between race/road and cx bikes?</a> and it has answered part of my question but it still leaves the rest unanswered.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
","<h3>Road</h3>

<p>Road bikes are designed for performance on (mostly) well paved roads. They are the lightest weight of the 3 categories, have the shortest wheelbase, lowest bottom bracket, and the steepest headtube angles. These geometry features allow the bike to react to rider inputs quickly and to have a low center of gravity which is beneficial when turning.</p>

<p>Wheels are almost invariably 700c - sometimes smaller wheels are used on very small frames. Tire sizes will typically vary from 20-25mm width but the most common width is 23mm, thus the 700x23 that you'll often see. Road frames can be made out of just about any material but the most common ones that you'll see are aluminum for budget oriented bikes and carbon fiber for high end bikes.</p>

<p>Gearing will be the highest and narrowest on this type of bike. Road bikes are designed to carry the rider and his/her water bottles and not much else, although some are drilled for fitting racks - usually on the less expensive side.</p>

<p>Road bikes still make great commuters if you want a light weight, fast reacting machine to get from point A to point B.</p>

<h3>Touring</h3>

<p>Touring bikes are designed for long, multi-day excursions on the road. They are usually the heaviest bikes of the bunch as they are built for durability and to carry a lot of stuff beyond just the rider. They will maintain a relatively low bottom bracket but the wheelbase will be longer and the head tube angle slacker when compared to a road bike. This adds to their stability, especially when fully loaded.</p>

<p>Wheels are often 700c but many are actually designed for 26"" - some will accept either, though this will make for a higher BB with the larger wheel. Stock tire sizes will run wider - usually 28mm or above. This makes of a more comfortable ride since the air pressure can be dropped.</p>

<p>You may see touring bikes made from other materials, but the most common is steel due to its forgiving nature and durability. Drillings for back and front racks are standard, and drillings for extra water bottles are common.</p>

<p>Gearing may be a little lower, but will certainly be wider on a touring bike. Sometimes mountain bike components are used for rear gearing to give the rider extra low gearing. This is very welcome when ascending with a fully loaded touring bike.</p>

<p>This type of bike makes an excellent commuter as it is stable and when fitter with racks/panniers gives you lots of places to put your stuff besides on your back.</p>

<h3>Cyclocross</h3>

<p>Cyclocross bikes are designed to travel both on and off road. Cyclocross is actually a race discipline that evolved as something for road racers to do in the off season, but the bikes have become very popular outside of racing due to their versatility. Cross bikes will typically be heavier than a comparable road bike but lighter than a comparable touring bike. The wheelbase will be in between that of a road bike and a touring bike while the bottom bracket height and headtube angle could be on either side of that of a touring bike depending on the manufacturer's philosophy.</p>

<p>Wheels will be 700c and tires will typically range somewhere in the 30-40mm width range with small knobs to grip loose surfaces as opposed to the slicks you'll see on dedicated road tires.</p>

<p>Frame materials vary widely just as with the other bike types, but for high end cyclocross frames carbon fiber is becoming a more prevalent material. Aluminum and steel are also common, especially amongst mid level bikes and below.</p>

<p>Traditional cyclocross gearing is a little odd as they typically come with a very close ratio double crankset but this may be compensated for by a wider cassette.</p>

<p>Race dedicated cyclocross bikes may have drillings for water bottle cages in the front triangle though you'll often see them with no bottles mounted so they don't get in the way of shouldering the bike over obstacles. On the other hand, many cross bikes are drilled for racks since they can double as a touring bike due to the similar geometry.</p>

<p>Cross bikes make wonderful commuters due to their versatility and durability. You can often run racks or not, and swap the knobby tires with slicks should you so choose.</p>

"Homemade bicycle degreaser liquids","84238","","<p>Does anyone have a recipe for a homemade bicycle degreaser solution? I'd like to make my own degreaser solution instead of buying one. I have read about using lemon juice and various types of alcohols - white spirits, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should have actually explained I was looking for a homemade bicycle <strong>degreaser</strong> liquid, not just <strong>cleaning</strong> liquid. I have now edited the title and wording. Sorry for the wrong title.</p>
","<p>If what you're looking for is a cheap alternative, here in my country is very common to use diesel or kerosene to clean bike parts. Personally I use diesel, I just pour a small amount in an old plastic cup, and use a brush (the kind normally used for painting) to rub it all over derailleurs, cogsets, bearings, etc.</p>

<p>It is plenty effective for removing even heavy grease. It is smelly and leaves an oily residue that can be easily removed with dish soap. (I prefer the liquid one). I Like to use it because it is effective, and the ""residue"" seems to be protective against corrosion for a few days. You can use rubber gloves, since diesel won't melt them, but if carefully used barehands, it won't cause much trouble as long as you wash your hands right after the job, which you can do with plain water and hand soap.</p>

<p>On a side note: Liquid dish soap is an amazing grease remover, but it needs scrubbing, so it does not make the job as easy as diesel. It is extremely useful for the rubber parts of the bike, leaves tyres looking really good, and does wonders with the grips: somehow they end up shiny but not slippery, and it's really easy on the paint job, try it!</p>

<p>Diesel has the advantage of being not so flammable as gasoline or kerosene. You can't light up liquid diesel with a spark or a match, but with kerosene or gasoline it's easy, thus my choice for diesel.</p>

<p>Another reason to prefer diesel over gasoline or paint solvents, is that it won't damage plastic or rubber parts, as gasoline would do. Some paint solvents may cause long term discoloration of paint (d'uh!) or plastic parts if used frequently. I haven't had these situations with diesel.</p>

<p>Kerosene is more flammable, less viscous and less smelly, but I have never used it for cleaning.</p>

<p>Many years ago, I used to clean with gasoline, but the smell is unbearable after a few minutes, it damages plastic, rubber and paint. It melts some kinds of rubber gloves and causes immediate damage to the skin. For some specific jobs it can be useful though, since it evaporates rather quickly, leaving no residue.</p>

<p>Bottom line: As with all flammable /volatile liquids, they should be used with caution, in open, ventilated environments, and should be stored carefully, properly labeled and out of reach of unsuitable users (children, elderly, etc...).</p>

<p>Sheldon Brown has a <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/cantilever-adjustment.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">good description of both kinds of brakes</a> but he does not give pros and cons.  Or suggest which are better.  </p>
","<p>The main reason that the direct pull (V brake) was invented is that it approximates a center-pull cantilever in terms of balanced force and leverage, while not requiring that the cable be anchored at some point above the wheel.  This is important for front wheels on suspension forks, but not significant for most other uses.</p>

<p>Another slight advantage of the V brake is that it doesn't generally protrude out of the profile of the bike quite as much and is thus somewhat less likely to be damaged in off-road use.</p>

<p>Neither advantage is of any importance for a road bike without a suspension fork.  However, there is the problem that the two require different levers (because the cable travel length is different) and the old cantilevered levers are getting hard to find, should you break one.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of internal gears?","79786","","<p>I've had my hybrid 24-speed for a bit over 3 years now, and just last weekend, when looking for a bike for my wife, discovered internal gears. Suffice to say it blew my mind when I saw 7-speed internal gear hubs, for example on this <a href=""http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-AU/bikes/model/suede.city.w.silver.purple/7519/44424/"">This Giant Suede Women's</a> bike.</p>

<p>So the question is, <strong>what are the trade-offs between the internal gear hub and an external gear hub and derailleur?</strong></p>

<p>I'm assuming they'll be more expensive? but what about the set of gear ratios they provide? the reliability? the serviceability? tuning/maintenance? other effects on the chain/sprockets?</p>

<p>Going back to the bike linked above, there's a <a href=""http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-AU/bikes/model/suede.w.lavender/7519/44423/"">near-identical model</a> with 21-speed external gears that's considerably cheaper, and I'm wondering whether the extra money for the internal gears would buy any real benefits (e.g. longer lasting chains/sprockets or fewer services), or whether it's just for fashion?</p>
","<p>The main advantages of hub gears over a 1xN derailleur system are reliability and being able to shift while stationary. Since there's no derailleur or chain tensioner it's easier to add a full chaincase which means chains last a lot longer and with mudguards added there are no dirty bits accessible on the bike. They're heavier and harder to maintain if you have to maintain them. </p>

<p>There's a whole style of bike that uses those advantages (and others) and from a US perspective is called a ""european"" or ""dutch"" bike. Broadly, it's a bike built for someone who is not a cyclist, rather they are someone who uses a bike for transport. It should just work, no special clothes or rituals required.</p>

<p>Compared to a 3xN derailleur system a hub gear is much simpler to operate and maintain. All the gears are in order and you only have one shifter. The compromise is a smaller gear range (Rohloff being the obvious exception), ranging from a little smaller for the Shimano Alfine 11 down to ""yes, there are two gears"" for the back-pedal-shift 2 speed hubs. But in return you get extremely long life for the chain and cogs (10,000km or more for the chain, 20,000km+ for cogs) and a general low-fuss maintenance requirement. That also makes it practical to put a hub gear in places where derailleur gears could go but you wouldn't want them - under my load carrying quad, for instance, where the derailleur hung down between the rear wheels just waiting for a rock to break it off, and turning the thing over for maintenance is a pain.</p>

<p>Removing the rear wheel on a hub geared bike ranges from nigh on impossible (some of the Shimano hubs, and some dutch bikes have chain cases that are just irritating to work on) to almost trivial (a Rohloff with QR). The problem is the shifter cable - you have to detach it to remove the wheel. Good ones just unhook, poor ones you have to undo the adjuster barrel and re-adjust the gears on reassembly. Shimano are getting better, but Rohloff and Sturmey Archer have it down pat.</p>

<p>Servicing hubs is not often done these days. The manufacturers generally allow bike shops to swap out the internals for new, saving the hassle of building a new wheel, but that's about it. I had three Shimano Nexus 8 hubs fail at 5,000km intervals, and every time I just got replacement internals rather than the hub being repaired (the last time, of course, Shimano had stopped making the hub so I had to throw away the wheel). With Rohloff the same thing might happen, except after 150,000km or more... most people don't ride that far in a lifetime. Also, with Rohloff you change the oil every 5,000-10,000km, at a cost of half an hour of your time and about $20 for an oil change kit (or $10 for just the oil).</p>

<p>I usually run a Schwalbe Marathon Plus on the rear of my hub geared bikes, which trades a little extra rolling resistance for huge puncture resistance. It's part of the ""my bike just works"" philosophy. I'd rather reliably take an extra 30s to get to work than at random intervals be 5-10 minutes late and dirty due to a puncture (because you know that you'll only get punctures when you're in a hurry and it's raining).</p>

"Pros and cons of single-sided forks (Cannondale Lefty)?","77267","","<p>Looks like they save some weight, but how do they have a better strength/weight ratio than a traditional two legged fork?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zFKmO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>With the single-legged fork the fork and axle must resist huge bending all the time, producing even more of a problem than with the 2-legged fork under uneven compression.</p>

<p>So how is this fork constructed and what advantages and disadvantages does this bring?</p>
","<p>The single-legged fork must truly withstand heavier bending forces than conventional forks, simply due to physics and asymmetricity. But because of it's different construction, the fork is actually stiffer than most 2-legged.</p>

<h1>Pros</h1>

<p>The top is attached like a dual crown downhill fork, which is much stiffer than a single-crown.</p>

<p>The wheel axle is one-piece with the bottom part, which is stiffer than quick-release axle (which is not solid at all) and on same level as a 15 thru-axle or 20 thru-axle. This design is used also on cars where the wheel doesn't have support from the other side.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is inside. While normal forks have round tubes that slide on oil film, the Lefty uses needle bearings on a square profile (same as the front leg of Boeings btw.):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kp1ld.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Such solution works with almost same friction under heavy side-loads, whereas sliding tubes when side-loaded (uneven compression of legs) do get friction losses (rolling resistance wins).</p>

<p>Having conventional fork with one leg wouldn't work, such fork would get stuck. Having bearing-fitted 2-legged fork is an overkill and unnecessary weight.</p>

<p>The heaviest Lefty is still lighter than lightest carbon 2-legged.</p>

<p>You can replace the tire without removing wheel.</p>

<h1>Cons</h1>

<p>If you need to remove the front wheel, you need to remove the brake caliper also.</p>

<p>The axle works only with cannondale hubs.</p>

<p>The front of bike will look unbalanced until you get used to it.</p>

<p>Pre-2013 models of Lefty are not sealed, having the bearings track just under a rubber sleeve. This required almost constant maintenance. Post-2013 models have rubber-sealed leg with bearings further inside and with one plain bearing at bottom which allows for service intervals as normal forks:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PNMWe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Previous models as some bikers on forums complained had more linear action, they were easier to bottom than normal forks. So now the newer ones should have more progressive compression (this is opinion based, but quite a lot of it online, there are no measurements)</p>

<p>Lefty is much harder to service than normal fork, you need couple special tools, the assembly is complicated.</p>

"How to use drop handlebars properly?","76753","","<p>This might seem like a really basic question, but there's no harm in asking. I've never had a bicycle with drop handlebars. I've always had sort of standard horizontal bars with only one hand position, which is on the rubber grips. I'm outgrowing the bike I have now, and thinking of upgrading next year to something faster. Pretty much every faster bike has drop handlebars, but I'm not sure how to use them.</p>

<li>Hand position 2: On the Drops - This position is ideal for more aerodynamic body positions, or more athletic efforts. When you want to go hard, go here. You can reach brakes and shifters, but may have to move your hands, depending on your setup. This is generally used for descending long hills, or an aggressive position. It is less stable, and it is used for maybe 10% or less of most riders' mileage.  </li>
<li><p>Hand position 3: On the tops - This position allows a comfortable alternative position for more relaxed riding. It is generally used when going at an easy pace, and in situations where you are certain of the road conditions, traffic and other hazards. You definitely can not reach the brakes or shifters from this position without moving your hands. It is less stable due to narrower hand position, though it may not feel like it.

Is it because of the little 20 inch wheels?  Are the more expensive folding bikes easier to ride?</p>

<p>By, ""hard to ride"" I mean that after a few miles on relatively level ground I get tired of riding whereas on a regular bike I could ride those same miles and I'm hardly affected. Kids had trouble too... they noticed it took way more effort to ride the small bike.</p>
","<p>Some folding bikes are quite good for long distances. Unfortunately, most of them seem to be optimized for short hops, by design (or by the fact of their design limitations). You're correct in thinking that more expensive folding bikes can be much easier to ride, where the  money is going for stuff like custom configuration or (even a custom-built frame). Folding bikes aren't unique in this regard, but economies of scale place additional limitations on them. </p>

<h2>Fit Limitations</h2>

<p>How to properly fit a bike has been covered in detail elsewhere, so I won't get into issues of seatpost height, reach, bar height, bar width, and so on. But most mass-market folding bikes seem to be built in a one-size-fits-none design. </p>

<p>It is quite possible to get a folding bike that's sized properly. However, since folding bikes are a small slice of the bicycle market, they're somewhat pricier. And keeping several frame sizes in circulation is even more expensive. Until more people buy folders, I think we're gonna keep having this problem. And very tall or very short people (or very heavy people--most folders have a weight limit of 200-225 pounds) have a lot of trouble finding folding bikes that will fit. </p>

<h2>Frame Flex</h2>

<p>Bikes that have frame hinges--like Citizens, and Dahons (and their clones) and the Raleigh 20's--are subject to frame flex. This can be combated by keeping the hinge joint tight, but many of these bikes will never be as stiff as a bike without a frame hinge. </p>

<p>Essentially, when sitting in the saddle, if you can move the handlebar forward and back, you've got frame flex. Some bikes can also have a flexy stem post, creating similar problems.)</p>

<p>(The Raleigh 20 has an angled hinge joint that, I'm told, mitigates the problem. From test-riding one, I'm inclined to agree with that; the bike didn't feel flexy at all.)</p>

<h2>Smaller Wheels</h2>

<p>Also, smaller wheels do tend to be a little ""squirrely"", in that they're harder to control. This does tend to be more if an issue with 16"" wheels than 20"" wheels, however. </p>

<p>This is fairly self-correcting, though, and it's something that the rider learns to compensate for fairly quickly. Until that point, though, it can impact the rider's ability to use the bike for longer rides. </p>

<h2>Handlebars</h2>

<p>Most folding bikes come with flat bars. As with all bikes, the more potential hand positions you have, the happier you'll be on longer rides. Bar ends will do this, and you may be able to fit them on the bike without compromising its ability to fold. </p>

<h2>Gearing</h2>

<p>""Do you have to pedal faster with those small wheels?"" It's a common misconception that small wheels make the cyclist work harder. When properly geared, small wheels can perform well. </p>

<p>However, many folding bikes come with three-speed hubs, for a variety of reasons. (Less maintenance, cheaper and lighter than 7 or 8 speed hubs, and derailers can get your pants leg messy when you have a folding bike on the train.) This is only an issue if you have hills, and it's not one of your specific concerns, but it is a factor for general use of folding bikes. </p>

<p>However, faster gears can make a longer ride more pleasurable--and shorter. My 3-speed folder tops out around 26 MPH, which means it's not so great for a long day of touring. (For some, speed isn't an issue, so this won't matter to parient riders in very flat areas.)</p>

The chain is properly mounted, the casette or freehub (I don't really know how it is called, that thing on which the chain resides on the back wheel) is spinning while I pedal, but the wheel is not. So I guess the problem is somewhere in the back wheel. </p>

<p>So I thought that something is completely broken, but sometimes the wheel is turning when I pedal. Thus I don't know if it is totally broken or is maybe just clogged, or whatever.</p>

<p>Is there a way to just repair it without buying new things?</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and answers (p.s. sorry for my bad English)</p>
","<p>If this is a single-speed bike (no shifting mechanism) then the rear hub is probably seized up and needs to be overhauled or replaced.  The hubs are designed to be overhauled by ten-year-olds (at least this ten-year-old did so, many decades ago) using ordinary tools, so they're not particularly complicated if you're mechanically inclined (or have a friend who is).</p>

<p>However, the hub may be so badly rusted that it needs replacing.</p>

<p>If the rear hub is a derailer-type hub with multiple sprockets then likely the ""pawls"" are broken or stuck as Zenbike suggests.  These can sometimes be repaired, but replacement is a better option.  Depending on the age of the unit it's either a ""freewheel"" unit where the pawls are in the sprocket ""cluster"" or a ""freehub"" unit where the pawls are in a attachment to the hub itself.</p>

<p>If this is something like an old 3-speed hub (with a thin shift chain entering one end of the axle then it could be just a problem with shifter adjustment, but if not then the bike is probably not worth repairing (unless you can find used parts).</p>

"Pros/Cons of Bar-Ends?","72975","","<p>I've always heard ""never use barends"" and they're banned equipment for some of the local clubs/group rides.  A number of people on-line swear by them though.  What's up with that!?  :-)  Why would I NOT want them?  When do I want them?</p>

<p>(Running with @sixtyfootersdude comment from <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1136/upgrading-straight-handlebars-to-drop-handlebars"">Upgrading straight handlebars to drop handlebars</a>)</p>
","<p>Bar ends are typically banned from group/club rides because of the potential to hook another rider when riding in a tight group.  Because a flat MTB-style handlebar is wider than a drop bar, adding bar ends increases the likelihood of snagging another rider.  (drop bars still can cause crashes though, which I've seen first hand)</p>

<p>On the plus side, adding bar ends gives you more hand positions to choose from (similar to using drop bars).  This is very important on long rides (e.g. touring) since your hands can go numb and possibly suffer nerve damage if you keep them in one position for too long.  Some people find the hand position on bar ends more comfortable too.</p>

<p>Papuass has been injured by a bar end in a crash.  My experience is the opposite: the bar end protected my hand from sliding along the pavement at high speed, saving me a fair amount of skin.  So it can go both ways.</p>

<p>If you're not doing group rides where bar ends are banned, I would definitely consider trying them for the sake of having more hand positions.</p>

"How tight should a fixie's chain be?","69095","","<p>I ride an <a href=""http://www.sebikes.com/bikes/lifestyle/urban-series/lager"">SE Lager</a> fixed.</p>

<p>How tight should the chain be and what is the best way of measure it? I have a <a href=""http://surlybikes.com/parts/tuggnut/"">chain tug</a> so I can be pretty accurate in dialling in the right amount of tension.</p>

<p>I don't like to have much slop. Part of the joy of riding fixed is having a direct connection to the road. I like to have it adjusted so that there's no significant movement of the pedals when the bike is stationary. This often equates to about a centimeter of movement in the chain if I squeeze the top and bottom of the chain mid-way between the cog and chainring but it's hard to judge how hard I should be pushing to get that movement.</p>

<p>As always, <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/fixed.html#tension"">Sheldon Brown</a> has a lot of information, mostly about centering the chainring(!!) and recommends having the chain as tight as possible without binding.</p>
","<p>The simple answer is, as Sheldon brown says, as tight as possible without binding. 
But define binding. The noises you described on your chain in <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/5169/1259"">your previous question</a> were symptomatic of binding or of a worn chain. The description you've given there of how you run your chain tension is tighter than I would recommend. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To clarify the tensioning - When I replaced the chain I adjusted the tension. There was a very noticeable adjustment required. But then when I subsequently adjusted the rear cog I didn't adjust the tug from it's setting with the new chain. I agree that I might have changed the tension marginally just be removing and refitting the wheel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 millimeter of movement is too tight, in every case I've seen. The manufacturing tolerances on the components (cog, chain, and chain ring, ans well as the hub, and BB axle), would need absolute perfection to allow that tight of tension to function without damage or noise. I've never seen good enough all at once, and you would need to be amazingly lucky or diligent to find that mix of perfection.</p>

<p>Typical tension on a fixie or single speed is roughly 1/4"" to 1/2"", or 5-10 millimeters, when pressing on the chain from the top, and from one side. A single speed requires slightly less tension, because the bearings in the freewheel will bind, and it won't roll at all, where a fixie will just be noisy and prone to wear. Make sure you check for the spot where the chain is tightest, and do the adjustment there, as well.</p>

<p>You don't need to be that tight, and your drive train will still maintain good contact between pedal and wheel. </p>

<p>Do you think this is a valid concern?  </p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of each?</p>
","<p>I've been looking into this a lot, and asking around at local bike shops, as I'm looking into getting a modern road bike.  In terms of failure - both aluminium and carbon are quite brittle, compared to steel, and from what I've heard (all non substantiated) they are both about as failure prone as each other nowadays.  Steel can also fail remember!  I'd be interested in a well reserached article into failure rates of different frame materials!  Well looked after, both types can last for a long time too. </p>

<p>One bike shop told me that cracks Carbon Fibre can be repaired to a certian degree, apparantly by injecting resin into the cracks then baking it back together, Aluminium can, apparantly, be harder to weld back together.  However, he was trying to sell me a carbon fibre bike!  </p>

<p>In theory, carbon fibre can be constructed so that the frame has different properties - stiff where it needs to be stiff, and more flexible where that would be required.  It can give a smoother ride than aluminium.  </p>

<p>When it comes down to it though, I suspect you can get badly made frames out of either material!  Can you try riding both models and see which you prefer?  </p>

<p>Edit:  Here's a video of two frames being stress tested.  Not the most scientific ever, but this particlar carbon frame takes more pubishment than that particular aluminium frame.

","<p>Copied this from a saddle mfg website:  How to measure your own sit bones </p>

<p>Of course the measure you really want is between the centres of your ischial tuberosities – the pointy lower parts of your pelvic bone on either side. Many bike dealers have a pad that you can sit on to measure this distance, but you can do it at home too.</p>

<p>Take a piece of aluminium kitchen foil and place it on a carpeted stair. Sit on the foil, lean forward a bit to approximate your riding position, then lift your feet. This should leave a good impression of your rear in the foil, and you can measure between the two points of deepest impression to get your sit bone width. </p>

<p>‘Narrow’ sit bone width would be 100mm or less, medium 100-130mm, wide over 130mm. </p>

<p>A saddle’s width is measured from edge to edge across the top, and Specialized recommends a 130mm saddle width for narrow, 143mm for medium and 155mm for wide. These ﬁgures should translate approximately across other ranges, with all other factors taken into account.</p>

"What is safer...coaster brakes, regular brakes, or fixed gear braking?","67044","","<p>I currently have a 'regular' bike, i.e. a bike with typical brakes but I've been more fascinated recently with single speed and fixed gear bikes. One of the reasons that I've held off on getting on is the braking.</p>

<p>How does coaster braking and braking on a fixed gear bike compare to regular brakes?  I live in NYC and want to make sure that I can brake in all situations!</p>
","<p>A track bike (fixed gear) has no front or rear brakes.  You slow the bike down by resisting the turn of the pedals but you need to be careful to not push too hard, which can lock up the rear wheel and cause a skid.</p>

<p>But most fixed gears aren't true track bikes.  You should be able to find one that has standard brakes on both the front and rear wheels.  The front brake is especially important since that's where most of your braking power comes from on a normal bike.</p>

<p>A coaster brake is basically a drum brake in the rear hub.  Pedalling backwards engages the brake.</p>

<p>Personally I would expect a bike with a normal front rim or disc brake to be ""safest"".  Front brakes have much more stopping power because your weight shifts to the front wheel when slowing down.  Plus you can control the amount of braking power more easily by hand than by resisting with your feet.</p>

","<p>It doesn't mean anything, really. It's a historical relic.</p>

<p>All those tire sizes you list are the same.  If there were different prices for the ""700x25"" and the ""700x25c"", it's because there was some other difference between the tires, like model, threads per inch, bead type (wire or kevlar), etc...</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any ways to get the remnants of the key out from the lock? Or is my only option to send this to the bike shop and have them saw it off?</p>

<p>I can provide pictures if necessary. I've been using a secondary chain in the meantime.</p>
","<p>It seems like you have 2 basic choices: (1) remove the key from the lock and unlock it with a backup copy of the key, (2) defeat the lock.  Option #2 is an awful lot like asking how to steal a bike...   Also, option #2 really depends a lot on the specifics of your lock.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lubricate the lock</li>
<li>If there's anything sticking out, try grasping it with needlenose pliers, nail clippers or something like that</li>
<li>If there's nothing sticking out, you can try a thin bit of metal along the side of the key with the teeth.  Or a couple sewing needles, or maybe a pair of thin tweezers.</li>
<li>Also worth trying giving the lubricant a little bit of time, then bang the lock against something, trying to get the key to fall out.</li>
<li>May be worth heating the lock; it may expand enough to release the key</li>
<li>A locksmith might be able to get the broken key out.  No idea if that would be more or less than the bike shop cutting it off.</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of those things work to get the key out, you have to really defeat the lock.  There are leverage attacks, but those are likely to break the bike.</p>

<ul>
<li>An angle grinder will get through it in seconds.  If it's a really good lock you might have to make two cuts.  Got any friends into power tools?  Someplace else you can rent or borrow power tools from? You'd need to use a vice to secure the lock so it doesn't move, and be careful not to hit the bike.  And all the other appropriate safety measures...</li>
<li>An electric hacksaw would, I think, take a bit longer but still not tire your arm out.</li>
<li>A hacksaw should work, but it's slow. It's likely that the price of a new hacksaw with the right kind of blade could be as much as taking it to a bike shop...  Might need a second blade...</li>
<li>If it was possible to close the lock without the key inserted, it should be possible to defeat it with a shim: cut away any rubber from the locking end of the U, cut a wide strip of aluminum from an aluminum soda can, wrap the strip around the U, slide it into the lock</li>
<li>If you can get a car jack inside the lock without hurting the bike, you can spread the lock open.  Most U-locks only lock on one side, the other side is an L joint, so if you spread it far enough the L will release. Or it might just break the U.  Be very careful with your bike doing this, of course.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I've never done any of these. I'm mostly only aware of those techniques in order to know what to look for when buying a bike lock. Only lock I've ever defeated was a simple combination lock back in the 80s that you could pull on and slowly spin the dials to feel what the combination was.</p>

I also noted on the <a href=""http://www.campagnolo.com/repository/documenti/en/10s_Power_torque.pdf"">user manual for Campag cranks</a> (right at the end) that you should ""Never spray your bicycle with water under pressure"".</p>

","<p>Yes, pressurized water can damage your bicycle, specifically by washing the grease out of bearing areas. Note, this is <em>pressurized</em> water.</p>

<p>Using a garden hose without a sprayer is unlikely to do damage. Using a garden hose with a shower type sprayer is unlikely to cause damage. Low pressure, so that it doesn't break the seals, is the point. (I avoid the risk, anyway, because I can't afford to be wrong, and how much pressure is OK depends on the strength of the seals on your particular bike.)</p>

<p>A car wash, or any other pressure washer, is pretty much guaranteed to do damage.</p>

<p>Washing by hand, with a bucket, a car wash brush, a toothbrush or gear brush, and some non-detergent based soap is the safest way, and with a little practice and preparation, can be done in half an hour.</p>

<p>28/32 designates the min/max range of width of the tire which the tube is intended to fit, in mm. So in your case, your tubes are designed to fit tires of width 28mm (minimum) to 32mm (maximum). This range should correspond to the width of your rim as well.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> From @Benson's comment on this answer (in case it gets deleted)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using a tube that's too big will mean it's exceedingly hard to get your tire back on, because the tube will have to fold out of the way.

The bike has straight handlebars, and having gotten used to the idea of commuting via bike, I'm interested in upgrading to drop handlebars. It looks like I'd need new break/shift levers to go with the handlebars; the whole upgrade looks like it'd run a couple hundred dollars. This is a sizable fraction of the original cost of the bike, which leads me to wonder if I'm better off saving my money for a new bike that's a little better adapted to my use.</p>

<p>Is upgrading my bike's handlebars a reasonable investment?</p>
","<p>I did this on my previous bike, and while it was a lot of fun (and I enjoyed riding the resulting bike) it was also quite expensive, almost half the cost of the bike.  You should also be prepared to put in a fair amount of research to determine if all the parts will work together.</p>

<p>Here's what's involved:</p>

<ol>
<li>New bars (of course)</li>
<li>New stem -- unless you can find drop bars you like that match your flat bars' diameter.  Most road bikes now use ""oversized"" bars, which requires a stem with a larger clamp.</li>
<li>New shifters.  I went with ""brifters"" (integrated shifters + brake levers) but these can be quite pricy.  Bar end shifters (on my current bike) can be considerably cheaper and should fit most bars.  Down tube shifters also cost less but your bike probably doesn't have the mounting points.  Of course, if you're very clever you <em>may</em> be able to keep your current shifters if you find a smaller diameter bar and mount the shifters on the flats.  Road and MTB shifters are interchangeable (within the same manufacturer and # of speeds) so compatibility is not a problem.</li>
<li>New brake levers, if not using brifters.  But road bike brakes use a different amount of cable pull versus MTB brakes, which means...</li>
<li>New brakes!  This is where it can get fairly tricky (and where I almost gave up) as you'll need to find something that will fit your wheel &amp; brake mount combination.  I went with cantilever brakes but this had the added problem of needing cable hangers in the front and rear.  Another option is to choose drop bar brake levers which are designed for MTB brakes (they do exist), but this rules out using brifters.</li>
<li>New brake cables and housings.  Your existing cables will likely be too short for drop bars so you'll need to replace all four cables plus the sections of cable housing that reach the bars.</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you're trying to keep the costs and headaches down, look for bar end shifters and brake levers designed for MTB brakes.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?  If you really want drop bars, enjoy working on your bike and it costs less than buying a new one, then yes.  But make sure you plan &amp; price it out.</p>

<p>Am I better off leaving my clothes at work, or is there a special bag that would let me carry in shirt/pants without them getting crushed?</p>
","<p>You have two options, essentially: You can either carry each day's clothing on every trip, or store clothing at work. </p>

<p><strong>Carrying clothing daily</strong></p>

<p>If you're going to do this, you'll need to find a way to roll up your clothing so it's not <em>completely</em> wrinkled. Be aware that even packing clothing in the most wrinkle-free way possible will still not keep it as fresh-looking as when you pull it out of the closet. </p>

<p>Many business travelers have found that the best way to transport clothing is to roll it. Do some searching, not on bike sites, but on business sites, and you'll find videos that get into this in more detail. But the gist: Fold along seams, then roll your clothing. The parts that must be least wrinkled (shirt collar, for example) should remain on the outside. You can also experiment with rolling around a towel, leaving some extra towel at the end and then rolling that around the bundle. This will become your clean-up towel at work. </p>

<p>As you're showering at work (or taking a sink bath), hang your clothing up and let it hang up a bit. Allow a little extra time for this. </p>

<p>It's worth noting at this point that many people continue to sweat even after they stop exercising, so you may want to wait ten to fifteen minutes before showering. (Riding gently for the last mile or three can also help.) </p>

<p>There are special cases that hold clothes, but they all (to my knowledge) involve folding them. I think that this will invariably crease the clothing. </p>

<p><strong>Storing clothing at work</strong></p>

<p>If you have a spare closet or other space where you can leave clothing hanging at work, this is a great option. Consider doing a half-commute on Mondays, carrying the bike and clothing in, then riding home. On Friday, reverse the process. </p>

<p>If you have a space like this, you can also leave shoes there, and possibly even a travel iron for touching up clothes (if you want to look particularly sharp). </p>

<p>You might consider leaving a spare outfit at work in any case. I always worried that I would forget, say, underwear, or a belt, so I left an older set of clothing in my locker. </p>

<p>If your work doesn't have a space like this, look into nearby gyms. Some gyms will let you use the showers and locker room for a small fee, one that's smaller than a gym membership. Some larger businesses even have gyms on-site for employees. </p>

<hr>

<p>It's worth noting that commutes of a mile or two may not require changing at all, but you'll still have these things to deal with in very hot or cold weather, or when riding in the rain. (Edit: Your 6k commute is a bit long for this, but it's still good advice in general.)</p>

<p>Best of luck on the commute! Speaking from personal experience, I recommend allowing a lot of extra time the first few commutes, and also doing a dry run of the route (if you haven't already). Also consider talking to any cycling co-workers: Some of them may have solved the problems related to your specific workplace. </p>

Why is this?  Intuitively, one would expect that a quieter drive-train would be an indicator of greater efficiency, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.  Is it something to do with different construction, or materials?  Can you get 'quiet' high-end cassettes, or is being noisy while coasting the price you must pay for being efficient while pedaling?</p>
","<p>Most of the noise comes from pawls on the freewheel hitting against the splines on the engagment surfaces which makes up the racheting unit.</p>

<p>Some reasons for the noise between freewheels?
<li>Tension on pawls could be higher causing more noise as they glide over the engagment surfaces</p>

<p><li>High end freewheels have more pawls and engagement points than lower end freewheels, so there are more ridges in the engagement surface and more pawls hitting the splines on the engagement surface. The reason this is desirable is that more pawls and engagement points means faster engagement when you start pedaling.</p>

<p><li>Different grease (or less grease) could also be used inside higher end freewheels that is less viscous and provides less resistance, allowing the spring action of the pawls to cause more noise as they float over the the splines on the engagement surface since they are less restricted by the grease.</p>

<p>Of course there are exceptions to these.  Some hubs don't use your standard racheting mechanism and use a 'roller clutch' instead.

<li>Is it to do with 'feel'? </li>
<li>Are my road
brakes rubbish, and most sets are
actually as powerful as v-brakes?</li>
<li>Obviously, current road levers
wouldn't work (well) with v-brakes..
Is it a pure legacy reason that
v-brakes aren't used?</li>
</ul>
","<p>A v-brake has too much stopping power for a road bike, and too little modulation. It requires significantly more contact patch, the rubber area of the tire which is in contact with the road at any given time, to maintain traction in a braking operation. A v-brake has too much power, and too little control of its power because of the linear design of the compression mechanism of the brake. If you managed to get the brake adjusted to work at all, it would cause the bike to skid immediately when the brakes were applied.</p>

<p>In addition the traditional lever pull on a road brake lever uses a different ratio of lever throw to cable pull (1:1). A V-brake (or cable disc or cantilever) uses a 2:1 ratio, which means the lever would have to travel twice as far for the brake to touch the rim. The road brake lever would have to be redesigned. </p>

"How do I make my rim brakes stop squealing?","61704","","<p>My rear rim brakes are squeaking loudly. I don't know what the problem is, but I am sure it has nothing to do with rain because it happens all the time even if it is dry.</p>

<p>Anybody have an idea what could be problem and how to solve it? It makes the rear brakes kind of useless, because if I use them I will scare the people or drivers around me.</p>
","<p>Squealing can be reduced by ""toe-in"" - making the front part of the brake pad touch first.</p>

<p>Check out Park Tool's instructions on servicing side-pull brakes: <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/dual-pivot-brake-service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/dual-pivot-brake-service</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Squealing is the result of a harmonic resonance from a slip-and-stick phenomenon, similar to how a violin bow resonates on a string. The brake pads grab the rim and are pulled forward by the force of the wheel. The arms must at sometimes jerk backwards, but if you are still braking, the arms are flexed forward again. This is repeated again and again many times per second, and this creates the squeal. Because of this, flexible and less expensive arms tend to squeal more than stiff calipers of better brakes. It is possible to reduce squeal by having the leading edge of the brake pad strike first. This tends to reduce the back and forth jerking of the arms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But before you go trying to toe-in, make sure you're working with parts in good shape:</p>

<p><strong>Examine your brake pads</strong>. If they are old and hard, worn deeply, or full of junk, replace them. Otherwise, use coarse sandpaper to take off the surface to bring out fresh rubber. You only need to take off a tiny bit.</p>

<p><strong>Clean your rims</strong>. Road grime, bike lubes, and brake material all collect on your rims. Rubbing alcohol, vinegar, Simple Green, a product marketed as ""degreaser"" can all work. Don't let any get on the drivetrain or in the hubs. Also, you'll need rags. </p>

<p><strong>True your wheels</strong>. There's no point in trying to adjust brakes on a wheel that isn't true (round and dished is good, too). And you can't true a wheel if the hubs aren't in good shape.</p>

"What is the easiest way to fix a loose chain?","60086","","<p>Are there adjustments that can be made instead of replacing it?</p>
","<p>It depends on what you mean by 'loose'... Chains stretch naturally over many hundreds of miles, and the stretching of the links is actually a good indicator of wear.</p>

<p>If, instead, it seems like there is a lot of slack or 'extra' chain, this is an indicator of one of two issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The chain is simply too long.</strong> All new chains (not already on bicycles) come longer than they need to be. If you recently replaced your chain, and didn't remove the extra links, this would cause the chain to be loose.</li>
<li><strong>The dérailleur is not creating chain tension.</strong> If you find that the chain seems to sag at both the top and the bottom, this may mean that your dérailleur has lost some of it's 'springiness' and is not effectively creating chain tension. It's hard to determine without further details, but if this is the case, the dérailleur may need to be replaced.</li>

"Can I use a Presta tube in a Schrader rim?","59973","","<p>I keep losing pressure in my tires, and among other things, I'm looking at the valves in the tubes.

I know the valve will be smaller than the hole and could cause issues there, but has anyone had success (or failures) with this?</p>
","<p>As you mentioned, one of the primary differences between a Presta and Schrader valves are the diameters--with Schrader valves being slightly larger--and therefore the valve holes on bicycle rims are drilled to suit one size or another.</p>

<p>Your foremost concern with using a Presta valve in a rim drilled for a Shrader valve shouldn't be 'movement' of the valve stem, as geoffc suggested, but rather a 'hernia' of the tube through the excess space at high pressure, leading to a blowout.</p>

<p>Most mountain bike tires sit at a low pressure, therefore you will <em>probably</em> get away with it, however, there is a very inexpensive adapter, sometimes called a 'valve grommet', which is made out of rubber or metal and serves to make the valve hole small enough for a Presta valve to fit snugly. It will also not come loose under high pressure, unlike geoffc's 'old tire' solution.</p>

"What to use to clean your chain (and cogs)?","59221","","<p>I've just tried cleaning my chain and cogs with some really hot water and washing-up liquid. I also used a toothbrush, j-cloth and a non-scratch scourer. After over an hour of some serious elbow grease I could shift some of the outer dirt and muck, but still can't get the base layer of grease off. What can I use to completely strip the grease and muck off the chain?</p>
","<p>A degreaser, whether aerosol or not, is an excellent way to remove grease from the chain. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/citrus-cleaner.htm"">http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/citrus-cleaner.htm</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/speed-clean.htm"">http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/speed-clean.htm</a></p>

<p>The degreaser will reduce the amount of elbow grease required but be careful and use a set of nitrile gloves to protect your hands. </p>

<p>My simple chain cleaning method is as follows:</p>

<p>Shift into the big ring and little cog, wet the rag with the degreaser</p>

<p>Grip the chain (lower portion, going from big ring to the derailleur) with the rag, focusing on holding firmly onto the outer plates.</p>

<p>Turn the crank putting the chain through the rag. Readjust as necessary as you remove grease and grime from the chain (ie. don't keep rewiping schmutz back onto the chain).</p>

<p>When sufficiently clean, remove the rear wheel from the bike and place it between yourself and a wall (ie. tyre against your stomach/tyre against the wall keeping the wheel propped between yourself and the wall) over a garbage can. </p>

<p>Using a thin screwdriver or a cleaning tool ( <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/products/detail.asp?cat=4&amp;item=GSC-1"">http://www.parktool.com/products/detail.asp?cat=4&amp;item=GSC-1</a> ) clean the grass and grease build up from between the cogs of the cassette/freewheel. Lightly apply degreaser to the brush portion of the tool and scrub at the cogs to free up the grease/grime.</p>

<p>Using a rag, with degreaser on it, insert the edge of the rag between the cogs and 'saw' back and forth with your hands thus spinning the cassette and fully wiping the whole cog. I typically move from top to bottom of the cassette (keep the grime flowing downwards). </p>

<p>Wipe down cassette, hub and any spokes/rim that could have been contaminated. Reinstall the wheel in the bike and one last time wipe down the chain with the degreaser rag. </p>

<p>And typically ... that method suffices for cleaning any of my bikes. The one caveat is that I typically don't let the chain get grease/grime covered and thus this takes about 3-5 minutes max and works really well. The worse your chain, the more you have to do. </p>

<p>You might want to look at your derailleur pulley wheels and using a flat edge against the pulleys as you spin the crank, remove the grease rings from the pulleys.</p>

<p>You might want to pre scrub the chain (similar to how you did the cassette) to loosen the grease/grime on the chain. A tooth brush w/ degreaser or the GSC-1 mentioned above would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Andddd... that's about all I've got for now. There are a plethora of other methods using chain cleaning tools, removal and soaking of the chain and nastier solvents but for the majority this method seems to work fairly well.   </p>

"Problem with chain skipping without trying to shift (even with new chain and gears)","58845","","<p>I have a mountain bike where the chain intermittently skips when put under load on the middle (and very rarely on the smallest) chain ring. It is not related to shifting.</p>

<p>I've taken several steps to correct it including:</p>

<ul>
<li>calibrated front and back gear shifters</li>
<li>replaced the chain</li>
<li>replaced the rear gears</li>
<li>replaced the middle gear at the pedals (which was the most affected)</li>

I've also checked the chain for stiff links but could not find any. I am not able to reproduce it when not riding the bike so I am not certain where and how the chain skips.

"What do you do to cure road rash more quickly after a crash?","58722","","<p>Crashes are an inevitability in cycling. This weekend, I hit a 4"" stick on my bike. It flipped over, stuck in the spokes of my front wheel and did this to it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFKVj.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It stopped my bike really quickly and I wound up flying over the handlebars, and earned a trip to the local ER where they spent an hour scrubbing the road out of my face, arms and shoulder.</p>

<p>So what tips and tricks do you folks have for recovering quickly (and without scarring) from road rash? </p>
","<p>Wow! That looks like a horrid crash. </p>

<p>There are some newer ideas on road rash healing. My doctor recommended that I <strong>NOT</strong> use Neosporin type ointments. The reason being that it only has an affect on the superficial layers of the wound and that infection, if it occurs, will be in the deeper layers; and also that topicals are shown to interfere with wound healing. He also told me not to use hydrogen peroxide as it damages tissue. The keys to healing and preventing scarring are to keep the wounds clean and moist.</p>

<p>The advice I got from my physician (who is a cyclist) is pretty much the same as the advice here on <a href=""http://www.freewheel.com/mvw/cure.htm"">freewheel.com</a>.</p>

<p>According to the article and my doc:</p>

<p>After a proper cleaning it's recommended to apply an application of a hydrocolloid or semiocclusive hydrogel dressing.</p>

<p>""A moist healing environment is provided by the dressing... Two basic options fulfill this requirement."" </p>

<p><strong><em>Semipermeable film dressings</em></strong>, such as Bioclusive (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey) andTegaderm (3M Company, St Paul), in combination with semiocclusive hydrogels such as Spenco 2nd Skin (Spenco Medical Corp, Waco, Texas). These dressings are impermeable to water and bacteria but allow the exudate to evaporate.""</p>

"Help Me Understand My Bicycle's Gears","58613","","<p>I've recently started commuting with a bicycle (Giant hybrid bicycle).  I've been trying to learn a little about bicycling to make my commute easier and my time on the bicycle more enjoyable.  Please forgive me for using the wrong terminology.</p>

<p>I've read that I should keep my pedalling speed mostly consistent and use my bicycles gears to adjust my speed.  The problem I'm having is understanding the 'how'.</p>

<p>My bicycle has 3 gears on the front of the chain and 8 gears on the back.  </p>

<p>Low gear == easy to pedal
High gear == harder to pedal</p>

<p>What I've found is that the gears don't follow a very logical (to me anyway) progression and because of that - I don't know how I should be shifting.  Currently, I've been keeping my front gear in the middle and using the back shifter to change between gears 3-7 or so.  I'm only use about four gears on my '21 speed' bicycle!</p>

<p>I'm also pretty sure the salesman said it was a 21 speed bicycle - but by my count there are 24 combinations.  I know (now) that I'm not supposed to have the front gear in the lowest position and the back gear in the highest (and vice-versa) but that seems to leave 22 gears.</p>

<p>How <em>should</em> I be shifting?  Should I really use all 21 or 22 gears?  I haven't done the math but it really feels like there is a big amount of overlap between the gears.  I hope this ascii art will make sense to someone.  This is just how it 'feels' to me.</p>

<pre><code>----1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8----
------------1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8----
--------------------1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8----
</code></pre>

<p>Does that make sense?  Is it right?</p>

<p>It feels like there is overlap between the three front gears and that to shift the most 'smoothly' I'd need to constantly change both gears.  But this seems really complicated to me.</p>

<p>I've ridden bicycles with only three gears and I found myself thinking 'More would be nice' - but now I'm overwhelmed.  I'm also questioning if anyone really benefits from so many gears?!</p>
","<p>Don't overthink it. Since you've got a triple, you're probably right to be in your middle ring most of the time That's normal.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the middle ring you should have access to the whole cassette/freewheel in the back, though you might get a little extra noise as you approach the extreme gears in either direction.</li>
<li>You'll use the big chainring when you're going downhill or your on flat ground and in a hurry. Stay out of the biggest couple of cogs in the back when you're in the big ring up front. This causes extra strain and extra wear on the drivetrain which can result in premature failure.</li>
<li>Your little ring up front is your climbing ring. Use this for hills, or as your bail-out ring when you're totally out of energy. Just like big-big is a no-no, so is small-small, so stay out of the smallest cogs in the back when you're in the smallest ring in the front.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding your hunch that you've got a lot of overlap between gears, you're absolutely right. Think of each ring as a gear range (climbing for small, normal use for middle, ass-hauling for big). If there were no overlap between the chainrings you would either A) have far fewer gears in the back or B) have a range of gears in the big and small rings which were far too small or far too big to be usable.Think about how big the jumps between gears would be if there was no overlap at all! Trust me, it's not what you want. Typically, you'll find yourself Shifting the front in one direction and immediately afterwards shifting the back in the opposite direction so that it feels like you've only skipped about a single gear in either direction. In time, you'll come to appreciate the overlap between gears in the different chainrings.<br><br>
Finally, if you really want to see how much overlap you have, you can divide the front rings by each of the back rings to get a ratio for every gear combination. There are fancier ways of doing this, but for your purposes this is the easiest and most straightforward.

"Deformed/uneven/bumpy wheel/tire/tube, how to diagnose or repair?","58259","","<p>My bike has a deformation in the rear wheel, almost surely not due to the rim.</p>

<p>At some point the tire has a ""valley"", causing it to bump instead of rolling smoothly. I'd like to understand if I have to replace the tire and/or the tube.</p>

<p>I checked the tube and it seems alright, I put it on recently and since then the wheel has become wobbly though. Both tire and tube are 700x35 mm, and they should be the right ones for the bike, since the tire is the original one.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I've ""played"" with the tire, deflating and re-inflating several times trying to get it seated properly. Now instead of a ""depression"" there is a sort of sideways deformation. </p>

<p>Also in this case the rim looks straight but I can't get the tire to sit right. I tried to put it in place in any way I could think, what am I doing wrong?</p>

<hr>

<h2>I've found the problem</h2>

<p>I didn't notice it before, but the tyre was worn out on the side, and the supporting structure was deforming. I solved the issue by buying a new tyre.</p>
","<p>It's hard to tell from that video - a side view would have been more useful.</p>

<p>From what you say it seems the rim is actually round in both planes - it doesn't wobble side to side <em>or</em> up and down as it rotates, so it's not that (but I can't see the rim in the video so I don't know for sure).</p>

<p>If the problem is the tyre it will be either because the tyre is not seated properly, or it's defective/worn out. But that sort of dip is unusual for a worn out tyre - normally they bulge (then pop). If the tyre isn't seated properly you'll normally be able to see it when you look at the side of the tyre. Where the dip is the normal markings on the side of the tyre will dip in too, meaning the bead has been pulled in on the rim rather than being pushed out against the sidewall/braking surface. If you're lucky that will have happened because the tyre wasn't installed properly. This is probably only on one side of the wheel, so check both sides. If it's on both sides probably the tyre is the wrong size for the rim, or you may just be particularly unlucky and have a slightly oversize rim and a slightly undersize tyre.</p>

<p>To fix, mostly deflate the tube, then work round pushing the bead in on the rim as though you were about to remove the tyre. Then pump the tyre back up slowly until the bead pops back against the rim. When this happens stop pumping, and make sure the bead has popped back all the way round. if not, work the tyre with your fingers where it hasn't popped - just squeeze the tyre in with your fingers. The movement should be enough to seat the bead properly.</p>

<p>But if it's a size problem you will need to buy a new tyre. If the size should be right but isn't, try a different brand of tyre. Some manufacturers are known to make ""tight"" tyres (slightly undersize beads), others do the opposite. Be aware that it is sometimes possible to put a 700c tyre on a 27"" wheel (700c = ISO 622, 27"" = 630 or so. ISO is roughly diameter, so the difference in circumference is 25mm or about an inch). It's very, very difficult to do, and shouldn't be done at all. If you're unlucky, you have one of the weird size wheels that's almost a modern size. <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html"">Sheldon Brown discusses wheel sizes here</a></p>

<p>If the problem is the tube it'll be slightly harder to detect. Tubes are not every strong compared to the tyre, but if you somehow tie a knot in the tube that will affect the shape of the tyre. The most common problems here are a twist, which basically turns the tube into one of those balloon animals; and getting folded back on itself. The fold usually happens when the bike is ridden with the tyre very under-inflated or flat. The whole tyre rotates slighting on the rim as you brake or pedal, but the value stops the tube rotating with it. Until it breaks off, anyway. So you get a stretched part of the tube, and the other side of the value all the slack collects and folds up. When you re-inflate the tyre there's wobble like in your video.</p>

<p>I describe that first because it's easy to check and fix. Deflate the tyre, pop it off, and if there's a big lump of folded up tube next to the valve, there's your problem. Often you can tell just by deflating the tyre than pressing down around the valve.</p>

2km or so @ 6%
4km or so @ &lt; 4%

Category 3
2-3km @ 8% (or less on average, but with very steep pitches)
2-4km @ 6%
4-6km @ 4%

Category 2
5-10km @ 5-7%
10+km @ 3-5%

Category 1
5-10km @ &gt;8%
10-15km @ 6%

HC
Often Category 1 climbs as the last climb of the day
15+km @ 8%+ (Alpe D'huez, etc.)
20+km @ anything uphill. (Galibier is ~=4% over 40km if I recall correctly)
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned though, you can find exceptions for any of these. Some examples would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>2006, the TdF included the Cauberg, a key climb of the Amstel Gold race. It covers about 1.5km with an average of about 5%, it was ranked Category 3. There are a couple hundred meters @ 11% on it and placed just before the finish, it shattered the peloton.</li>
<li>2010, stage 12 finished just after the Col de la Croix Neuve. This was ranked as a Category 2, despite being only 3.1km long. It averaged 10% though, so hardly easy.</li>
<li>Many of the category 4 climbs in the early flat stages would be unranked on a hillier stage. They exist so there is excitement in the king of the mountains classification early.</li>

","<p>Downtube shifters will really get you in touch with your bike--more than with many other shifting systems, I believe that I can actually FEEL the rear derailleur moving in my hand when I use them.  </p>

<p>Needless to say, I ride a lot of old road bikes.  </p>

<p>You will quickly gain the control to shift either from various hand positions on your road bars.  Assuming the bike fits you, you should ultimately be able to use the shifters from nearly any position.  You will, of course, use the right hand to shift the rear derailleur and the left hand to shift the front.  </p>

<p>I will talk mostly about shifting the rear derailleur, as it will require the most control and finesse.  </p>

<p>Note also that these shifters each have two main parts that are pertinent here, the LEVER and the BARREL.  The lever is pretty obvious--it's the usually-flattened handle that sticks out.  The barrel is the round bit which is attached to the frame.  The cable wraps around this round bit--as you turn the shifter, more or less cable is wrapped which is how the shifter moves the cable and thus the derailleur.  </p>

<p>Ordinarily, when I reach down and the bike is in high gear--with the shift lever all the way forward and parallel with the downtube--I will grasp the lever by wrapping <strong>the thumb of my right hand over the end of the shift lever</strong>.  I press the side of my pointer finger against it and slowly pull back.  This motion has less control over precise gearing and is best suited for quickly downshifting before climbing.  </p>

<p>If I am already in low gear and the shifter is out away from the downtube, I usually actually <strong>grasp the entire lever</strong> with my right hand.  In this mode, the tip of my thumb is on the barrel and my fingers are all wrapped around the shift lever.  Motion in either direction from this position can be very precise.  As I said, you can feel the derailleur move if you're cables are new and well-greased.  </p>

<p>It's a good setup for shifters, in my opinion.  I can't say that I prefer downtube to integrated, but as far as simplicity is concerned... nothing beats it.  </p>

<p>Except, perhaps, Sheldon Brown reaching down and putting his forefinger on the chain to move from upper to lower chainrings.</p>

<p>If you get a chance at the library, check out <em>Understanding, Maintaining, and Riding the Ten-Speed Bicycle</em> by Denise De la Rosa and Michael Kolin (Rodale Press, 1979).  This book describes shifting and using downtube shifters rather well, right down to the groovy 70's costume.  De la Rosa describes another method of hanging the thumb (I think) off of the top tube while reaching with the same hand's fingers down to the shift lever.  This only would work on a frame smaller than mine, but it's another piece of cycling history.  </p>

<p>I hope this helps.  It certainly took my mind off my work for a few minutes!</p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of riding a smaller Mountain Bike frame?","54289","","<p>I am 182cm (5' 11'') tall and am looking into buying a new frame for my mountain bike.</p>

<p>Right now i have a 19'' frame and i found a good deal on a 17'' frame. </p>

<p>The guy from the shop told me that it shouldn't be a problem for me to get a 17'' frame since you can have a longer stem and seat post so its fits alright.</p>

<p>Smaller frame means lighter but what are other advantages and disadvantages ?
Would you choose a smaller frame ?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
The difference top length (seat tube to handlebar stem) from my 19'' to this 17'' is 1cm.</p>
","<ol>
<li>With a smaller frame, you will need an appropriately longer handlebar stem in order to retain the cockpit length. This will affect handling of the bike: it will feel more ""lively"", which can be good in some cases (tight turns, difficult terrain) or bad (less stable) - in most cases.</li>
<li>A smaller frame will be marginally less reliable, and more prone to break, due to bigger stresses in its structure; longer stem and seat post mean bigger levers to exert force on the frame. But this should not be a significant effect.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a rule of thumb, a 17"" frame is an inch or two too small for your size. I would not recommend taking the smaller one without actually riding it for a couple of hours and making sure it's comfortable for you.</p>

"How often should I lube my chain?","54204","","<p>I ride less than 200 miles a week, and I'm at about the 200 mile mark on my new road bike.  Most of my riding is done on the road in an urban city, so there is a lot of odd, unnatural debris.  My LBS told me to lube my chain every 150 miles, but I've read conflicting opinions.</p>

<p>How often should I be lubing my chain?</p>
","<p>Lubricate when needed.  I don't think it's possible to put a mile marker on when to lube.  I think most people add chain lube too often.  Too much can cause debris to build up on the chain.  Too little lube can cause unnecessary friction; but you'll know pretty quickly by the looks (and possibly sound) of it if you have too little lube.</p>

<p>Hints:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wipe your chain off before you add
more lube.[*]</li>
<li>Is the color black?</li>
<li>Is it greasy?</li>
<li>Wipe all that schmutz off until it's
looking dry.</li>
<li>Add lube while rotating cranks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lube the night before you ride: this
gives the lube a chance to 'spread'.</li>
<li>Wipe the excess off immediately
before you ride - but not until dry
as above.</li>
</ol>

<p>^ [*]. Wiping off the chain is best done in a work stand or while the bike is in a position where you can rotate the crankarm such that you can hold a rag to the chain while the chain is moving.</p>

"How to deal with lock that keeps jamming?","54055","","<p>I have a kryptonite U lock and lately it's been sticking a lot while trying to turn the key. Usually I can eventually get the key turned. It was getting worse though and a few days ago I (unable to find any lube/wd-40 etc) cleaned it out with soap and water which seemed to help a great deal. I also started being very careful to make sure the little key-hole guard engaged. Last night when I was totally unable to get my bicycle unlocked and had to leave it there and walk home. The key would fit into the lock and turn half way and then stop. I'm going to go try and pick it up now, but I don't know the best way to try and make sure this doesn't keep happening. It's winter here and I wonder if that might have something to do with it.</p>

<p>Edit: I ended up at the hardware store and the guy there (who had built his own bike in his garage, conveniently) recommended jig-a-loo. This made the lock move really well but I still couldn't get it open. This is when I noticed that my key was twisted (From trying to force the lock probably). I flattened the key back in a clamp and was able eventually to unlock it, but I can't seem to lock it again, so I ordered new keys. I'll have to wait till they come to see if that solves anything or it's actually a problem with the lock...</p>

<p>I lube my chain and check brakes and tire pressure weekly, but how often do I need to get the hubs and bottom-bracket taken apart and lubed?</p>
","<p>Looking at the spec of your bike it says the BB is a cartridge unit. This probably isn't serviceable -- it's designed to be replaced when worn out, so just keep riding it until it grinds or gets excessively sloppy.</p>

<p>The hubs might be serviceable. If you ride a lot in nasty conditions, or you're aggressive with the degreaser you might want to service them. However, if they're well-sealed (like most modern hubs and in particular Shimano hubs) then they almost never need servicing. If you're worried, learn how to service them yourself and see what they look like. If they're still packed with grease and nice and clean inside they don't need servicing. Servicing them isn't hard but it's a bit fiddly -- you'll lose a bearing under the fridge, then you won't be able to remember if there should be 9 or 10 balls, and whether they're 3/32"" or 1/8"" or 5/32"", and so on. Don't do it for fun.</p>

<p>I ride a lot. My Campagnolo Neutrons have probably seen 10,000+ km. In that time I've had a look at the bearings once or twice. Still greasy, still smooth. The rims will wear out before the hub bearings do.</p>

"What is the practical advantage of disk brakes over rim brakes?","52661","","<p>Disk brakes are becomming more popular on bikes now, and I was just wondering what the advantage is of this type of brake over the older rim brakes.</p>
","<p>Working backwards from how it works:</p>

<p>Not using the rim means the brake is unaffected by how straight the rim is, and heating the rotor doesn't affect the tyre. The rim is not worn away by braking and the rotor material can be selected entirely for its suitability for that one purpose. This also allows smaller clearance between pads and rotor, allowing:</p>

<p>Increased pressure between brake pad and rotor compared to rim brakes means disks are less affected by water or other contaminants. Pads can be made of harder material giving increased pad lifetime.</p>

<p>Having the brake caliper further away from the tyre means it's less affected by mud, and it can be made partly or fully enclosed to further sheild it. The rotor is also less likely to  hit obstacles as it's further from the ground.</p>

<p>Being a hub brake makes unconventional designs possible. Single sided wheel mounts are the most obvious example, but some suspension systems are incompatible with rim brakes, and building a rim braked carbon composite wheel is much harder than building one to use a hub brake.</p>

<p>Disk brakes can also be fitted to both sides of a wheel for increased heat dissipation, and it's easier to vary the design for different characteristics (weight, heat capacity, modulation etc). Doing that with a rim brake means the brake manufacturer has to start selling wheels as well.</p>

<p>These combine to make disk brakes more reliable and easier to maintain.It's also somewhat easier to remove and reinstall wheels as you don't have to release the brake first.</p>

"Cyclocross bike as fast as a roadbike?","52229","","<p>Next year i would like to commute by bicycle. I need to buy a new bike, but i don't know if to buy a <code>roadbike</code> or a <code>cyclocross bike</code>.<br>
I live in a more rural area where not every road is tarred perfectly and there are several ""gravel highways"", expecially on the shortest distance to my workplace (about 20 km). Now there are several solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy a roadbike and stay on the roads, where the distance is significantly longer (about 25 km).  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OR</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>buy a cyclocross bike and ride on each kind of street.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally the problem is not the distance, but the time i need to commute, especially in the mornings.<br>
So, is a roadbike that much faster than a cyclocross bike so that it's worthwhile to take a longer distance to commute and be even faster? </p>
","<p>TL:DR Get the CX Bike, you'll love it! You get three bikes in one, without trading in any noticeable performance on the road. This answer is subjective and based on personal experience, you have been warned:</p>

<p>I have a CX bike that is used as a do-it-all bike, and I love it.  For almost all aspects that concern any non-professional cyclist a CX is as good, or even better when compared to a ""true"" road bike, with some nice added benefits. Here's why:</p>

<p>I use it to commute because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is fast. It is light. And robust. You can get a second hand one (or similar) for 400$. </p></li>
<li><p>It has enough space for comfortable road tires (28 wide fits with ease)</p></li>
<li><p>Offroad performance is still great without the use of noisy/bouncy knobby cross tires (I use 700c x 28 Schwalbe Delta Cruisers, a perfect allround tire with enough grip on gravel while still fast and comfortable on the road. 25% of commuting is on gravel/ hardpack sand. In 3000km on these tires not a single flat, plus they are quite affordable!)</p></li>
<li><p>Enough room for mudguards in rainy weather, due to the frame spacing and the cantilever brakes.</p></li>
<li><p>In rainy weather, the brakes are designed to keep functioning and not clog up with mud, leaves etc. It is true that canti's are slightly less powerful in dry conditions compared to modern road brakes. But they have proven very reliable under all conditions.  Discs would be even nicer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I use it for long vacation trips</p>

<ul>
<li><p>again because of the comfortable tires</p></li>
<li><p>The possiblity to carry quite some stuff on a seat post mounted rack, without worrying about damaging the bike or cracking the frame, since CX bikes are built for strength and durability.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I use it for riding with my friends (who all ride <em>very</em> expensive shiny carbon bikes) because:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are not pro's, we ride fast, but always for fun. The 700g weight difference (if that) between my bike and theirs does not matter to me. How much beer we had last night has a much bigger impact on how fast I am. </li>
</ul>

<p>I even use it for light MTB duty because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have a set of old pretty beat up off-road only wheels for the bike with CX tires, swapping wheels takes only 1 min. thanks to the canti brakes.</p></li>
<li><p>The bike is very fast on grassy/forest singletracks, as long as there are not too many braches, steep climbs or large drops you can easily keep ahead of most ""real"" MTB's. Of course this is only within reasonable limits, I am not saying a CX bike can do any seriously challenging terrain.</p></li>
<li><p>In deep mud, the thinner CX tires cut through the mud and ride on the solid surface beneath the mud, where the MTB's float and lose traction. Up to about 3 inches of watery mud on top of a more solid surface a CX bike will be faster than wide MTB tires. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>On top of all this, here in Europe CX is pretty much a niche market. Most road bikers won't touch a CX bike, because they think they are slow (not true, as long as you don't race for a living). High end new CX bikes are all that leave the shops, those bikes then end up on the second hand market after a few years, where nobody seems to want them, thus you can get a much nicer bike for your $.
All parts are interchangeable with road bikes too, apart from the brakes, so upgrading is always an option.</p>

<p>All in all, CX bikes are just more rugged road bikes that seem to get very little attention by the mainstream road crowd. Too bad for CX manufacturers, but good for us no-nonsense bikers who are looking for a 3-in-1 bike solution. </p>

"Chain slipping on newish bike","52078","","<p>I've looked at most of the answers for related questions and they all speak about replacing parts that are old.</p>

<p>I just bought a new bike from a friend who rode the bike for about a month before leaving it in their garage for about 3 years only riding it on occasion.</p>

<p>When riding it home I came round a corner and was about to head up a slight hill. I shifted gears and the chain came off.</p>

<p>Yesterday I rode it to work and it was fine, but the chain keeps slipping whenever it is under reasonable load (such as going up hills). </p>

<p>I did some research and watched a few youtube videos. I also have a housemate who has been riding for years and we adjusted the derailleur this morning. But on my way to work this morning it still slips regularly. It is not slipping into another gear just crunching for a split second. It also changes gears without problem.</p>

<p>I looked at teeth on the gears and everything looks good as new. It is a 21 speed with Shimano gears.</p>

<p>Although everything is quite new could the chain be stretched just sitting in storage? What else should I be checking?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update to cover some of the points in the answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The chain only came off once on the day I was riding it home after I purchased it. The chain is now just slipping. I think it came off due to the way I changed gears.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure if the slipping is happening on the front or rear gear or as it goes through the derailleur</p></li>
<li><p>It's not my gear changing technique. At first I thought this may be the issue so I tried going easy on it yesterday and it still sleeps even if I have been in the same gear for 2 minutes before going up hill.</p></li>
<li><p>I have noticed it slips if I can't maintain the same pressure on the pedals. So if I slightly weaken the pressure for a second or pedal slightly slower it will slip.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no visible rust on the gears or the chain, but I will look at some of the other posts and see how to clean and lube the chain and will check this weekend to see if there are any stiff links. There is also no visible damage to any of the gear teeth, front or back. However the derailleur does look dirty.</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>Learning some better shifting technique may solve this. It also could be that, despite your best efforts, the derailers are out of alignment. </p>

<p>Two questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is the chain falling off on the front chainring or on the rear cogs? If so, is it happening on the inside or outside? (If it's happening in the rear and the chain is hitting the spokes, this can be an extremely serious problem that can be a danger to the rider. Other scenarios are not as serious.) </li>
<li>Can you tell us more about the bike? You mention a Shimano drivetrain; Shimano makes differing levels of components, and even top-level components won't work very well if a bike is assembled poorly. Is this a reputable brand of bike purchased at a bike shop, or is this a <a href=""http://magnificentnose.com/2011/07/04/why-bikes-from-big-box-stores-are-dangerous/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">big box bike</a>? </li>
</ul>

<h2>Shifting technique</h2>

<p>This is particularly a problem with bikes that have twist-grip, bar-end, downtube, or other shifters that allow the user to shift through many gears all at once--or at least allow them to try; this will often pull the chain off the gears. The solution to this problem--aside from designing the bike to not do this in the first place, or having it adjusted more regularly--is to <strong>shift gears slowly, preferably one at a time</strong>. If you must shift quickly, at least slow down near the end of the shift! </p>

<p>You mentioned that the chain is coming off when shifting under load. On derailer bikes, you really are meant to shift while continuing to pedal but letting up a bit on the pedals. <strong>Shifting under load is not advised</strong>. I can't stress this enough. </p>

<p>A big part of proper climbing technique is getting into the habit of shifting in advance to avoid having to shift under load. (If you're stuck in a difficult gear, sometimes you can coast for just a second while you shift. You'll lose a little momentum, but you'll avoid walking the hill.)  </p>

<h2>Mechanical causes</h2>

<p>If none of these solve the problem, you may need to face that your derailer adjustments may not have done the trick. I'd bring the bike into a shop and have a pro wrencher <strong>adjust the derailers</strong>.  </p>

<p><strong>Cable stretch</strong> tends to come about with use more than time, but it could be a contributing factor. A derailer service will include adjusting the cables. </p>

<p>There are other possible causes, although they're less likely than shifting technique problems or derailer maladjustment:  </p>

<p><strong>Chain stretch</strong> is actually the wearing away of the insides of the metal links, and it only happens with use. While a stretched chain can increase problems like this, I suspect that chain stretch isn't an issue. However, it's at least <em>possible</em> that the bike came with an older chain, and <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2787/how-to-know-when-to-change-a-chain"">it's so easy to check for chain stretch</a> that it can't hurt to do so. </p>

<p>Similarly, <strong>worn gear teeth</strong> can also cause this, but this is extremely unlikely to be the cause. (Checking for those is a little more involved than checking the chain.) </p>

<p>It's also possible that the bike has <strong>the wrong size of chain</strong> on it, or that the chain is too tight (or too loose). </p>

"Can I just change straightforward wheel axles to QR skewers?","51974","","<p>I've just bought a second hand road bike which doesn't have Quick Release Skewers. </p>

<p>Can I just buy a set of QR Skewers and fit them? </p>

<p>Are they a standard size?</p>

<p>Are there any gotchas waiting to bite me if I do change to them?</p>

<p>Is there anything specific I need to look for in order to change to QR Skewers?</p>
","<p>I'm not sure if you intend to replace the axles themselves, but AFAIK, most nutted axles are <strong>not</strong> hollow, which means they can't accommodate QR skewers. If this is true in your case, you will need to replace the <strong>axles</strong> outright in order to use QR skewers.</p>

<p>QR axles for modern hubs <em>do</em> come in a few ""standard"" sizes, but you will nevertheless want to measure the dimensions of your frame and hubs anyway, in case they are not standard. You mentioned your bike is second-hand, which indicates it might be older, in which case this is doubly so.</p>

<p>There are three dimensions to check:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hub spacing</strong> - This is the distance from the inside of one dropout to the other. You can measure this by removing the wheels from the frame and sticking a ruler in the dropouts. To replace the axles, you will need to find QR axles and skewers to match your hub spacing.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the QR may be too short or too long for the hub. With non-QR axles, an axle that is too long is not a problem (the nuts will still go on fine, and if you need to, you can cut the excess axle), but with a QR axle, you can't really trim the axle, because the QR skewer can't be trimmed.</p>

<p>Typically, hub spacing on modern bikes is 100 mm (front) and between 120 and 130 mm (rear). Again, you should measure this yourself-- I'm just giving you an idea of what these numbers should be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Axle diameter</strong> - The QR axles you get should match the diameter of the existing axles so you can re-use the existing cups and locknuts (unless you were planning on replacing those, too).</p>

<p>Common axle diameters are between 8 to 10 mm, or 5/16"", or 3/8"".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thread pitch</strong> - This is basically the angle of the threads on the axle. Like the diameter, this will need to match the existing axle if you want to re-use the cups. According to <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/axles.html"">The Sheldon</a>, thread pitch is measured in either threads per inch or millimeters per thread, with a 1 mm/thread pitch being equivalent to 25.4 TPI.</p>

<p>Common thread pitches include 1 mm/thread, 26 TPI, and (rarely) 24 TPI.</p></li>

"What are advantages and disadvantages of CO2 inflators over frame pumps?","51900","","<p>I have a frame pump that I've used on the road when replacing flats, but I always see CO<sub>2</sub> inflators advertised at bike shops.  Are they worthwhile for the potential weight savings?</p>
","<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast - generally these fill up your tire much faster than you could with a pump</li>
<li>Less effort - hook up, push button, no pumping</li>
<li>Possibly less weight (but I haven't compared weight of smallest pumps to CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Lower initial investment - a valve and 2 cartridges generally seems to be cheaper than a <em>good</em> small pump.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumable cartridges - which is a cost issue if you have to fill up often</li>
<li>No backup - if you patch a flat and don't get it quite right, you don't have a way to fill up anymore.  You could carry extra CO<sub>2</sub> cartridges, but then you could lose the weight advantage.</li>
<li>Limited on what tires they work with. Big tires will get less pressure.</li>
<li>Less friendly - if your friend gets a flat and you've got one cartridge, will you loan it? If you've got a pump it's no problem at all.  I've helped out complete strangers with my pump before.</li>
<li>Goes low faster. CO<sub>2</sub> seeps through the tube a bit faster than air, so you'll have to top off the tire sooner than if you'd used a pump.</li>
</ul>

<p>One possibility to consider is a combo unit.  Generally the pump on those is terrible, but it should be enough to get you home if you run out of CO<sub>2</sub>.  Or carry both a pump and a CO<sub>2</sub> valve and a cartridge.  That way your first flat can be fixed super-fast and you avoid all the disadvantages (and the weight of a simple valve and one cartridge isn't much).</p>

","<p>The speed is the number of cogs on the rear cassette. This matters because higher numbers of gears (esp 9speed) mean that the chain must be narrower to fit between them.
Generally 6-7-8 speed chains are the same and 9 speed are thinner, more than 9 speed is a bit specialized.</p>

<p>The length isn't as important because you will usually have to shorten the chain to fit your bike. The standard chain is 114 pins (56 links) but you almost never need to know this ( I had to look it up!).</p>

<p>There was a big jump in the late 80's/early 90's, some of which could be attributed to the doping practices of the time, but not all of it. Doping of some form or another has been going on since the beginning of the TdF.</p>

<p>It seems really odd to me that given:</p>

<ul>
<li>improved training</li>
<li>improved nutrition</li>
<li>improved technology</li>
</ul>

<p>there is only roughly a 10% increase in speed since the 1960s and virtually none in the last decade.</p>

<p>Are we being defrauded by companies trying to sell us all sorts of products (carbon whatnots and sugary goo!)?</p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The chart ranges from about 25km/h to over 40km/h, and that is a big change. As others have mentioned, increasing your average speed requires a non-linear increase in power applied to the pedals.</p>

<p>In other words, to increase average speed from 25km/h to 26km/h is easier than increasing from 40km/h to 41km/h</p>

<p>Say I were to steal a time-machine, go back and ride each TdF course, using the exact same bike. To match the winners average speed, this is the wattage I would need to produce (well, a very crude approximation):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zg5y1.png"" alt=""Wattage required to match TdF winner each year""></p>

<p>(again, this is a very crudely approximated graph, designed to illustrate a point! It ignores stuff like wind, terrain, drafting, coasting, road surface and many other things)</p>

<p>From around 60 watts to 240 watts is a huge change, and it's very unlikely that TdF competitors have increased their wattage this much over time..</p>

<p>Part of the increase will be due to more powerful cyclists (thanks to better training and nutrition), but certainly not all of it.</p>

<p>The rest is likely due to technological improvements. For example, a more aerodynamic bike will decrease the power required for a given average speed, same with a lighter bike when going up hills.</p>

<p>Source for graph: Although my point should remain valid regardless of how inaccurate the above graph is, here is the messy script I used to generate it</p>

<p>The width of the chain and the cogs is the biggest issue. The pulleys on a 10 speed dérailleur are narrower, and a 10 speed chain will not rest correctly on the jockey pulleys of a 9 speed dérailleur. </p>

<p>That does not mean it will not physically work, only that the shifting performance will be slow, you may drop gears unexpectedly, or have the chain skip unexpectedly.</p>

"Why is carbon fiber inherently weak? Or is it?","47814","","<p><a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/2061/8"">This question</a> got me to thinking: If it were possible for me to use a carbon frame, I would, but the expense and my riding style keep me using steel and aluminum. (I like hauling stuff on racks and I'm not a skinny guy.) </p>

<p>I'm looking for a <strong>physical reason why</strong> carbon is a weak, fragile material, suitable for light bikes that will be treated delicately. Keep in mind, they make airplanes out of this stuff! </p>

<p>Is there some reason carbon fiber has to be treated with kid gloves? What is it about the material that resists being light <em>and</em> strong? Or, perhaps, is the weakness of carbon a myth, and it's all in the way that carbon bike frames are built at present? </p>
","<p>Carbon fiber isn't necessarily a ""weak"" or ""fragile"" material. If you had a tube of the same diameter and thickness of typical CF as a typical steel frame tube, that CF tube would be extremely strong and durable.</p>

<p>Metals like steel and aluminum are isotropic materials. That means their mechanical properties are identical in all directions. If you have a cube of steel, it will respond the same way regardless which direction you pull or push on it.</p>

<p>Carbon fiber is a composite material. It consist of tons of little bundles of the fibers held together with an epoxy. </p>

<p>A block of steel is, well, like steel, but carbon fiber is like a big bundle of straws glued together. In one direction, it is extremely strong, but if you push or pull to the side, it will collapse. In that one dimension where it is strong, it is vastly stronger than steel. However, in other directions it's rather flimsy.</p>

<p>So, engineers have been able to exploit those properties in bicycle frames. In a bicycle frame, the vast, vast majority of the forces are primarly along a single dimension. They can make tubes thinner and lighter yet still retain the desired strength and stiffness. </p>

<p>So, there is no mechanical reason that you couldn't build a fully loaded touring bike or something like a Salsa Fargo with a carbon frame, and it could be just as tough and durable. And it would probably be lighter than a steel or aluminum frame. But the reason it isn't done is because of the market. Carbon fiber is an expensive material and difficult to work with, and its mechanical properties are best suited for when you demand very light applications. </p>

<p>When you build a steel framed bike, when you get the tubes sufficiently strong enough along their length, that because of steels isotropic properties, you get the lateral strength for free, the strength to resist things banging into it, withstanding crashes, etc.</p>

<p>In a carbon fiber frame, you don't get the strength in the other dimensions unless you choose to design it in. In carbon fiber bikes, where weight is a serious concern, the engineering decision has been made to not make the frames strong in those areas. They could do so, but they choose not to because its not necessary for the bikes intended purpose.</p>

<p>When you build a heavy loaded bike, you lose a lot of the carbon fibers advantages, and so it would be far more economical to use steel or aluminum.  Especially when throwing a couple filled water bottles in your pannier nearly exceeds the weight savings.</p>

<ol>
<li>They're really a solution for a poorly fit bike, where the rider can't reach the regular brake levers. Fix that and you don't need an extra lever on the flat of the handlebars. This was especially a problem for smaller riders. Bike sizing and fit have improved a lot since then.</li>
<li>Since they effectively pre-pull your brake a little, they reduce how much travel you can get out of the primary brake lever which can reduce the effectiveness of that primary brake lever. (I guess some designs don't have this problem, but most did)</li>
<li>Using them puts your hands in a location that doesn't give you much leverage for controlling the bike.</li>
<li>It's an extra piece that can break (and leave you unable to brake). Especially, if the main brake lever is knocked out of alignment, the extension lever will hit the handlebar.</li>
<li>Modern brake levers (""aero""?) have a different pivot setup that works better over all, but especially works better with hands on the hoods than old levers did. Extension levers simply won't work because of the way a modern lever pivots. If you look at a modern brake lever, when you pull the lever the top of the lever doesn't go down, it goes forward, and extension levers rely on pushing down on the top of the lever. Sin As you can see from these blurry pictures of a vaguely modern brake lever, the pivot is somewhat low and in front and the top of the lever rotates straight forward. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/luCpL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6LPU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>

I am thinking about doing this to do some riding on gravel roads/touring/commuting from rural areas.  I have an older steel Norco.  How rough can I ride this with bigger tires without damaging the bike?  (Purely just for curiosity.  I am not planning on doing any drops etc but if I drop off a curb now and then does that matter?)</p>
","<p>Road frames come in a wide variety of styles, so it's impossible to give an exact answer without knowing more about your bike.  Also keep in mind that wider tires also have a larger diameter, so your bike has to have enough clearance for both.</p>

<p>A typical modern road bike with caliper brakes is going to have very tight tolerances: many will max out at a 28mm tire, some at only 25mm.    When mine was built, I had the frame customized and used long reach brakes just to allow 28mm tires plus fenders -- even then it's a tight fit.  Another problem with calipers and wide tires is that you may not have enough brake cable slack to remove the wheel easily (I have to deflate mine slightly to get the tire past the brake shoes).</p>

<p>Touring and cyclocross frames tend to be built with much more generous proportions and have room for bigger tires.  Using cantilever brakes also helps give much more tire clearance vs. calipers.  My last touring frame used 32mm tires and could have easily gone up to at least 35mm, if not bigger.</p>

<p>If you're putting on much larger tires, you should also consider larger rims (see <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#width"">Sheldon Brown's tire/rim sizing chart</a>).  Using a big tire on too small a rim is a recipe for trouble.  Plus a wider rim adds more strength.  So you may need a wheel rebuild to make this happen.</p>

"How do I know when to replace my tires?","46595","","<p>The treads on my road bike's 28C tires are almost completely gone—they only persist along the shoulders of the tire.  Do the treads matter?  What is a good indicator of when the tire as a whole needs to be replaced?</p>
","<p>The tread on a road bike's tires is really quite unimportant and purely cosmetic.  Road bike tires have tread patterns because they sell better, not because they perform better.</p>

<p>Here's some questions to ask to decide about replacing a tire:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you see any of the fabric?</li>
<li>Are you getting flats more easily than you used to?</li>
<li>Is any part of the tire bulging out or lumpy?</li>
<li>Are there visible holes/gashes in the tire?</li>
<li>Does the wear indicator indicate you should replace?  (Some tires have dimples or grooves that are there to indicate when the tire should be replaced.  Some have an alternate color of rubber underneath, and when that shows through the tire should be replaced)</li>
</ul>

<p>Smooth tread is actually ideal for road conditions, but not commonly found on tires.  If you're on hard surfaces such as pavement/asphalt, the tread doesn't help you and actually slightly reduces contact area and increases rolling resistance.  On most road tires the minimal tread pattern is just cosmetic to make their customers feel better (since a smooth tire looks slippery).</p>

<p>See also: Sheldon Brown's <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tires.html#replacement"">comments on tire replacement</a> and <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tires.html#tread"">tread patterns</a></p>

<p>If you plan to ride through mud, sand or other soft surfaces, you need tread.  So when you no longer have tread on your mountain bike or cyclocross bike's tires, it's time to replace them (unless you plan to only use them on the road).</p>

You'll be stretched out a bit less and more upright. Cross frames also will have wider tire clearances for 32mm to 35mm tires, but it varies by model as some can fit 38mm to 45mm tires.   </p>

<p>Traditionally, brakes tend to be wide profile cantilever brakes for good tire clearance and less chance of clogging with mud on cyclocross bikes.  However, disc brakes are now readily available on many cyclocross bikes.  Road / Racing bikes tend to use caliper brakes which have better modulation, but typically have small tire clearances, which may be too restrictive for cross tires, especially when they are covered in mud.</p>

<p>The new standard rear wheel size for disc cross bikes seems to be 135mm, so it's the same as mountain bike disc hubs. Non disc cyclocross bikes tend to have rear hubs which are spaced at 130mm, the current road standard hub spacing.  </p>

<p>Tires on a cross bike are going to be different as well.  Road bikes will typically have skinny 23mm to 28mm slicks.  On a cyclocross bike, you will typically have knobbier tires which may not last as long and provide more rolling resistance when compared to road tires, which is a tradeoff for having better handling on dirt / grass / mud.  You can always swap out tires to match whatever style of riding you prefer. Depending on how serious you are about racing, you can find both cyclocross and road tires available as glue on tubular tires.  However, some people have been adapting mountain bike tubeless technology and mounting cross tires as tubeless to run lower pressures for better offroad handling. It is not common to use the mountain bike style tubeless setup on a road bike, and generally not desirable.</p>

<p>Road bikes and cyclocross bikes tend to use STI shifters and similar groupsets (chainrings / cassette / derailleur combinations), however sometimes people prefer to use bar-end shifters for cyclocross (or retroshift shifters which mount bar end shifters on brake levers).  Additionally, some cyclocross bikes have an extra guard on the outer chainring to prevent injury when mounting / dismounting frequently. These guards are typically not as heavy duty as mountain bike bash guards.</p>

<p>Cable routing tends to be different on cyclocross bikes due to the need to shoulder a  bike during the race, so under the top tube routing is typically avoided.  Sometimes 3 cables on top of the top tube or internal cable routing strategies are used.  Often times full housing will be used to help prevent cables from getting contaminated with mud as easily.</p>

"What should I be doing a week before a long distance bike ride?","46153","","<p>I have a 50 mile bike ride in 1 week.  I have been training for a while and I am trying to figure out, at this point, if I should be:</p>

<p>Any suggestions for what to do a week before a big bike ride?</p>
","<p>The correct answer is both. You should do a long ride, around 80% of your goal distance 4 days before your actual ride, and then rest off the bike for 3 days. </p>

<p>That gives your body a wake up call that serious exercise is coming, and then a rest period to build up for it. </p>

<p>For most people, 3 days is enough to recover, but not so much as to lose the gains you made. </p>

<p>FWIW, 50 miles is a long ride, but not so long as to need to be excessively concerned with your training schedule, as long as you've been putting miles on the bike, and as long as you pay attention to eating the right food, in enough quantity, both in preparation for the ride, and while doing it.</p>

","<p>There are a number of reasons for using either toe-clips (pedal straps) or clipless pedals:</p>

<ul>
<li>It allows you to pull up as well as down, increasing the efficiency of your pedalling. This is something that you need to work at to get full effect from, as it is not a natural motion to most people. In Cadel Evans' book ""Close to Flying"" there is talk of a bike he uses for training that has a ""freewheel"" mechanism for the cranks which forces you to practice lifting the pedals as well as pushing them.</li>
<li>It positions the pedal under the ball of the foot giving you better leverage. While you don't need straps or clipless to do this, it does help keep your foot in the right place.</li>
<li>It helps to stop your feet coming off in rough ground while mountain biking.</li>
<li>It gives you more control over the rear of the bike allowing you to lift and shift the rear more easily. This makes it easier to bunny hop, and helps with controlling the bike on rough ground.</li>

"What is the meaning of 11-32 cassette and 12-25 cassette?","45770","","<p>I'm going to buy an 2015 Shimano 105 groupset and i have got 2 options in choosing the cassette, the first is 11-32 and the second is 12-25 and i have no idea what these numbers indicate and which one would be more suitable for me? 
-knowing that i'am still a beginner-.</p>
","<p>If you imagine a cassette, will have a bunch of sprockets on it. The current 105 range (which came out last year) will have 11 sprockets, the earlier 105 had 10 sprockets.</p>

<p>The notation you've noticed simply means that for one of these cassettes, the smallest sprocket has 11 teeth, the largest has 32 teeth. And the second cassette has smallest sprocket 12 teeth, largest sprocket 25 teeth.</p>

<p>So these numbers are basically the ""range"" of gears covered by a cassette.</p>

<p>You might imagine that a large range (e.g. 11-32) is good, as it would give you lots of teeth to climb steep hills, but also a small cog which you can use to power downhill. And this is correct, but there is also a flip-side. A larger range of sprockets means that there can sometimes be a jump of a few teeth between each sprocket, which can be less smooth when changing gear. Hence, if you don't actually <em>need</em> the large range, a smaller range would give you a smoother ride.</p>

<p>As regards which one you should choose, it's not really down to whether you're a beginner or not, more to do with how good a climber you are. If you feel you might struggle going uphill, a 32-tooth sprocket is probably going to be a good choice for you.</p>

<p>The other thing to remember is that, when you're thinking about gears, the cassette is only half of the story, the other half being the cranks. The number of chainrings, and the number of teeth on each chainring, will also affect the gear range and smoothness. But that's probably a different question...</p>

"Leave a bicycle in the rain for a day - is it safe?","45723","","<p>I use my bike (gt avalanche 1.0) to commute to work. Now it's autumn and so rain can happen just every day.</p>

<p>So the questions are: is leaving my bike outside harmful? Should take the seatpost with me or better leave it in place?</p>
","<p>It's no problem, but there are a few things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep all the moving parts well oiled. Note that even if you only ride on roads there will be more dirt getting on it, so you'll need to give the chain a good clean, let it dry, and oil it.  This should stop the mechanicals getting too rusty, some screw heads will rust but not too badly.</li>
<li>Wet rims don't brake as well, especially if the wet isn't pure, so after riding off the first stop may take longer (and be noisy). If the rain has stop it may be worth applying the brakes (carefully) once or twice right after starting your ride, to get the rims dry.</li>
<li>Get a waterproof saddle cover, then take it off when you want to ride - so much more comfortable than a wet saddle, especially if the saddle has stitching which lets the water in.  This is better than a plastic bag, because you can leave it on, and only remove it if it's wet. Alternatively, get a saddle with a plastic surface, then you can just wipe off the rain.</li>
<li>If you're expecting really heavy rain, your lights might not take it (as I found out recently) so you might want to take them with you (of course you might want to anyway so they don't get stolen). This is for removable lights; if you have lights that are meant to be installed permanently (for dynamo use), they will gererally be watertight.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you ride in the rain, then keep the bike in a shed on a damp day, it won't dry out properly for hours anyway, so the actual outside storage isn't much extra punishment on top of the ride (assuming of course that it's wet all day)</p>

<p>Point is that the ""bike specific"" greases generally aren't. </p>

<p>As far as functional necessities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not too thin - A thin grease, like <a href=""http://www.slickhoneyusa.com/aboutus.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slick Honey</a>, will run very smooth, but only for a very short time. If you want ideal performance, and don't mind overhauling your bike every couple weeks, use this.</p></li>
<li><p>Not too sticky - Motorcycle/Automotive type bearing grease tends to be very sticky and very thick. They are designed to thin out at higher levels of heat and friction than a bicycle will reach. So it will last a long time, but will feel tight, and add friction to your bearings.</p></li>

I have to admit, I am a large guy at 6'3"" 250lb (190 cm, 113,5 kg), and I have always had issues with my road bike's tires getting pinch flats.  I could never seem to put enough air in the tire to keep the rim off the road on bumps, etc.  I ride a mountain bike now and I haven't had the same issues.  Though of course they are a lot knobbier/thicker.</p>

<p>The tires are 27 x 1.25</p>
","<p>Pinch flats are due to under-inflation of tires.  On a road bike you should be inflating your tires to 120-130 lbs.</p>

<p>Also, you need to check and re-inflate your tires every time you ride.  I just keep my pump right next to my bike, and wind up adding air every 2nd or 3rd day.</p>

<p><em>I see you added tire size</em> - those are older bike tires, they don't inflate as high as road bike tires, I'd try pumping them to 65 lbs, and if you are still getting pinch flats, go up 5 lbs at a time until it stops. </p>

<p>You can tell a pinch flat because it will look like a snake bit, 2 small holes close together.  </p>

<p>If you do not get any pinch flats at 65 lbs, you can try going down 5 lbs at a time until they return, then you know the range your tires need to be at to be properly inflated.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to check tire pressure every time you ride, as bike tires can lose up to 5/lbs a week from just sitting.  These are high pressure tires, so they lose air much faster than low pressure car tires.</p>

","<p>Folding versus wire refers to the material within the bead or 'edge' of each side of the tire. Foldable bead tires use kevlar in most cases (I think) and tires with each type are entirely compatible with the rim size that the tire is designed for (in the absence of a manufacturing defect). Folding bead tires have a few advantages (in my opinion):</p>

<ul>
<li>Somewhat lighter</li>
<li>Easier to store (can be refolded by flattening the tire and folding it into a bundle)</li>
<li>Bead has more stretch to it, so mounting the tire is <em>usually</em> less difficult</li>

"What are the advantages or disadvantages of different spoke styles","44511","","<p>I see triathlon bikes with various different spoke styles, from normal wire to aerodynamically shaped blades to completely solid wheels, but I can't understand why there should be so many styles.</p>

<p>I can understand needing less spokes on an indoor track, as you won't get bumps, so I'm okay with that, but can anyone shed light on the decisions behind the other styles?</p>

<p>I have also seen <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/2120/2077"">this question</a> on flat spokes but that wouldn't explain the wing like spokes or the solid wheels, would it?</p>
","<p>Yep, there are various types of spokes, as already explained.  There are also various ways of ""lacing"" the spokes, and various spoke counts.</p>

<p>When picking a spoke lacing scheme, there are six basic considerations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Torque resistance</li>
<li>Air resistance</li>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Appearance/sex/stupidly spending money</li>
</ol>

<p>Strength is determined by the number of spokes, how they are arranged, and how they interface with the hub and rim.  If you look at a normal ""three cross"" wheel, the spoke leaves the hub at an angle nearly tangential to the hub circumference.  This way the stress on the hub is minimized.  A ""four cross"" lacing (commonly seen on heavy touring bikes an the like) goes that one better and causes the spoke to be truly tangential to the hub circumference (plus the increased spoke length gives the wheel more ""spring"").</p>

<p>You rarely see ""two cross"" and probably never see ""one cross"" lacings, but ""radial"" lacing (where the spokes leave the hub at right angles to the circumference) is becoming fairly common, especially on front hubs of ""mountain"" or ""cross"" bikes.  Radial lacing places considerable stress on a conventional hub, and with radially laced wheels you'll often see the spokes reversed, with the nipples on the hub end, because the hub must be redesigned to stand the stress.  Additionally, both because a radially laced wheel is so stiff and because usually radial wheels have low spoke counts, the stress on the rim is higher, such that the nipples would be apt to pull through.  So you'll sometimes see the bent end of the (reversed) spoke engaged in a slot in the rim or some such.</p>

<p>Note that while radial laced wheels are stiffer against radial forces on the wheel, they don't resist torque very well at all -- if a rear wheel were to be radially spoked the torque of the drive train would cause the wheel to twist into a sort of spiral, hindering the transmission of power to the wheel circumference.  Similarly, if disk brakes were used on a radial front wheel the wheel would twist severely when the disk brakes were applied.</p>

<p>[However, it should be noted that some people like to lace their rear wheel with a cross pattern on one side and radial spokes on the other.  This provides the needed torsional rigidity while permitting half the wheel to be radial, but it's not clear that there's any real advantage to the scheme.]</p>

<p>Air resistance obviously increases with spoke count, and is affected by the profile of the spoke as well.  Although air resistance is important to pro racers because the top of the wheel is moving forward at twice the speed of the bicycle, it's probably safe to say that the air resistance due to spokes on a standard 32-spoke three-cross wheel would not be noticed by most average bikers, even at fairly high speeds.  </p>

<p>The ultimate low-wind-resistance wheel is the disk wheel, of course, and there are other exotic designs with 1, 2, or 3 broad, flat ""spokes"" made of high-strength composites bonded to rim and hub.  But generally you'll only see the disk wheels on rear wheels because the disk becomes a kite if it gets cross-ways to the wind as would happen on the front wheel.</p>

<p>Weight is reduced by using more exotic materials (especially for the rim), and by reducing spoke count.  The more exotic the rim, the more intimately the design of the rim ties into the spoking scheme.  Some slight weight reduction is also possible by reducing the ""cross"" of the spoking (and hence reducing spoke length).</p>

<p>And, of course, sex.  Many of the above schemes (especially things like the low-spoke-count radially spoked front wheel with reversed spokes) have little practical benefit for the average cyclist, add cost, and reduce reliability.  (Ever heard one of those fancy high-tension spokes go?  It sounds like a gunshot.  And if one breaks you're likely dead in the water until you can get to a bike shop, whereas with a standard three-cross 32-spoke wheel one can usually ""limp home"" if a roadside repair is not possible.)</p>

","<p>The numbers 113, 115, etc. mean the total axle length in milimeters.</p>

","<p>So long as you don't use cheap 'pound shop' hooks screwed into some plasterboard to hang up a really heavy BMX (with pegs on the axles) then I doubt you will have any health and safety issues. Those 'pound shop' hooks are designed for hoes and other garden tools, not bicycles. You also have to be careful about what you are screwing into - your average hook will work well carrying weight if screwed into the ceiling, put it round 90 degrees into the wall and any weight applied is trying to shear it out. This should be okay with a quality hook but not with the cheapies.</p>

<p>If you are a tenant then it might be an idea to ask the landlord first otherwise he will have another excuse to not return your deposit when you move out.</p>

<p>But you wanted the bike's perspective. Posipiet has that covered - in summary it is highly unlikely that you will damage the rim if using a typical plastic covered hook.</p>

"What is the purpose of the plastic disk between the cassette and the rear wheel?","42829","","<p>There's a plastic disc between the cassette and rear wheel on my bicycle. It doesn't seem to have any effect on the actual drivetrain; but I've seen it on a number of bicycles.</p>

<p>What is it for?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#spokeprotector"">Sheldon Brown</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spoke Protector</strong></p>
  
  <p>A plastic or sheet-metal disc that fits between the cluster and the right-side spokes of a rear wheel. This is intended to prevent the
  derailer or chain from getting caught in the spokes, possibly causing
  very extensive/expensive damage/destruction to the wheel, the
  derailer, and the frame.</p>
  
  <p>A spoke protector is not a necessity on a bike that is well treated, because the derailer can't go into the spokes if it's
  properly adjusted and if it is not bent. Bicycles which are subjected
  to rough handling, however, are prone to getting the rear derailer
  bashed in, and in such a case, the spoke protector can prevent very
  serious damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from purely personal anecdotal experience: I have a friend that doesn't like spoke protectors and has been pretty vocal about it. Faith would have it that a maladjusted XTR derailleur wrecked his wheel and destroyed itself. A spoke protector would have prevented just that.</p>

<p>I'm not very clued up on 11-speed systems, was wondering why this is the case? And, presumably, when they say ""hub"", they mean just the freehub body?</p>

","<p>Shimano/SRAM 11 speed cassettes are wider than 8/9/10 speed ones.  So yes, you need a new, wider freehub body, unless your old one was not very old and used a spacer to fit a 10-speed cassette.</p>

<p>People with non-Shimano brand hubs are less likely to find replacement freehub bodies, it seems, leading to replacement of the whole hub, or even the whole wheel if the old rim isn't worth relacing.</p>

"Building my own full suspension MTB: How to I select a frame?","41624","","<p>I've recently gotten back into mountain biking.  I took my 5 year old Iron Horse full suspension out to the mountain with some friends that had recently purchased new bikes.  I haven't ridden for a few years so i had to take my bike in for a major tune up before the trip.  My bike was kind of a cheapo ($700) and really could just barely handle the terrain we were riding.  I mean just barely.  </p>

<p>We stopped at an enormous bike shop on the way back just for fun, and I was pretty envious of what I saw there.  The technology has come pretty far in 5 years, and if you are willing to put $2000 to $3000 on a bike, you can get a serious machine.  I'm tempted to simply purchase one of these premade bikes, but I hated how I always had to take my old bike in for tune ups because I didn't know how anything on it worked.  This time I want to know the ins and outs of my bike so I can make all the repairs myself.  I've already started a tool kit collection and recently got an awesome repair stand by ParkTool.  I've turned my old MTB into a comfy commuter bike and have had some fun tuning it up myself.  Now its time for my fun bike.</p>

<p>I know what I want is basically an all Mountain bike.  Some thing I can tear down rough trails with, but still is useful enough for those long climbs to get to the top those trails.  Here is what I want out of my new bike:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Light</strong>: As light as I can go with a reasonable budget.  I think carbon frames are most likely out.  I'd like to spend less than $2500 for the whole bike.</li>
<li><strong>Durable</strong>:  I'm a big guy. 220lbs when I'm fit, but 250lbs now. 5'10"" tall. So sturdiness is a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Full Suspension</strong>: I just prefer the softer ride.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is going to revolve around the frame. So I'm gonna start there.  Here are some questions that have been piling up during my search for a frame.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Where is the best place to browse a good selection of frames?</strong>  After some google searching, the only place that had a respectable selection to choose from was <a href=""http://www.cambriabike.com"">www.cambriabike.com</a>.  And my god they have a ton of frames, too many for me to figure out actually.  There has to be other places though right?  Most I saw had less than 20 frames, while cambriabike had about 1000. That doesn't make much sense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What brands should I be looking for or avoiding?</strong>  I'm not keen on many bike brands but I do know a few, Cannondale, Kona, Specialized, Iron Horse, Giant.  But I see alot of brands on frames that I've never heard of.  Should I stay away from unknown brands or are there some frame makers out there that are great who just haven't made a name for themselves in full bike assembly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get a frame with suspension shock already imbedded, or empty full suspension frame and install my own shock?</strong>  I really would prefer to install my own shock so I can choose the exact one I want.  I'd like to know a little bit about my shock and research it, plus I'd really like to find one that supports remote lockout.  You see it on front forks, but not really on rear shocks.  Anyways, I spoke with a guy at the bike shop and he said shocks had to be specially made for each frame.  That eye-to-eye length had to match just right with compression ratios and yadda yadda yadda.  I think he just wanted to scare me off so I'd buy one of the show room floor. After I get my frame, I should be able to take a look, and buy a freaking shock from Fox Racing or something that fits the bike right?  Then I can make adjustments to its performance with it's built in features.  Am I wrong here.... is it really so complicated that each shock has to be custom made for each frame?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to tell the difference between a downhill frame and an all-terrain frame?</strong>  I realize there are sectioned out on the cambriabike website, but dang, some of them look so similar.  There are exotic looking down hill frames and exotic looking all-terrain frames.  I wouldn't be surprised if some frames showed up under both categories.  I haven't verified that, but I wouldn't be surprised.  If you were to look at a stats sheet, how do you REALLY differentiate between a downhill frame and an all-terrain frame?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is considered ""light"" for a frame?</strong>  I guess you'd have to segregate carbon from aluminum frames, but what is actually ""light"".  I'm looking at a frame here and it says 7lbs.... is that considered light versus the competition?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do you pick a frame size?</strong> I see frames that say 18"", 19"", Large, Medium, what the heck is all this.  What is 18"" mean.  18 inches from what?  And medium.... medium what?</p></li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li>The internet. Bike magazines. Bike shops. Your friends.</li>
<li>Just as in any other industry there are good and bad brands. Good brands occasionally build awful bikes and vice versa. Read reviews, see the things in person, and test ride them.</li>
<li>It's very difficult to buy a frame without a shock. They don't have to be custom made as such, but rather custom tuned. Frame designers will usually work with the shock manufacturers to make their design work together with the shock. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, with a variety of tunes (high &amp; low speed compression/rebound etc). Some shocks simply don't work well with certain suspension designs. Some won't fit due to piggyback reservoirs etc. </li>
<li>A downhill frame is designed to be thrown down mountains at ludicrous speed. Look for 180mm or more of suspension travel, a coil-sprung shock and very slack angles. Full-on cross-country bikes tend to be built for the exact opposite. Look for 100-120mm travel, air shocks  steeper angles and ludicrously light weight. All-mountain bikes sit somewhere in between, with 130-160mm travel, air shocks, fairly slack angles and a reasonably light weight. There's hundreds of pigeon-holes though (Freeride, Slopestyle, Dirtjump, etc) so if you're not sure, google the thing and see what it's for!</li>
<li>~7lbs including shock sounds about right for a longer travel (~150-160mm) aluminum all-mountain frame.</li>
<li>An 18"" frame is usually 18"" from the centre of the bottom bracket to the top of the seat tube. The best thing is to go to the bike shop, sit on a variety of bikes and sizes and see what fits you! Many manufacturers will also have a size guide on their website and/or in their literature.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, slacker head angles give more confidence when descending, as do lower bottom brackets, but both have their downsides when climbing (wandering front end, pedal strikes). Look our for ProPedal (on Fox shocks, similar tech on others), which gives you a partial lockout for use when riding on fire-roads and other less technical terrain. </p>

<p>Some other things that come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fit a super-short stem (50-60mm) and wide bars (710mm or wider). They'll feel weird for the first 20 seconds and then you'll never be able to go back. So much better!</li>
<li>Drivetrain: Shimano and SRAM are the big players. My personal preference is for Shimano but they both make good stuff. Shimano SLX or SRAM X7 tend to provide the best ""bang for buck"", the XT and X9 being lighter and XTR and X0/XX providing serious bling. They aren't always compatible, so usually best to stick with one or the other.</li>
<li>I run a 1x10 speed setup (1 front chainring, 32t, with an 11-36t cassette out back) with a chain device. Unless you live in some seriously steep hills/mountains or spend a lot of time on the road, I find it's a wide enough spread of gears for most things.</li>
<li>There's a hell of a lot more to consider on top of that. Forks (how much travel? 15 or 20mm bolt-thru? Don't go for a plain old quick release!). Wheels (hubs, rims, tyres, go tubeless!). Brakes (Shimano SLX with 180F/160R rotors are really good). Grips (Get lock-ons!). Saddle. Seatpost (fixed or adjustable - check out the Rockshox reverb). Pedals (Flats or SPDs). Etc.</li>

<p>I eat a small bowl of Cheerios with some fruit thrown in for flavour. I ride most morning at about 5:30am. If I'm working hard (either 2 plus hours or 2 hours really hard workout) I'll carry some Gatorade diluted 50/50 (I find it's easier on my stomach).</p>

<p>When I ride 100k+ or century length I make sure I get up and eat 3 hours before the ride. Then drink 50/50 Gatorade till the ride. During the ride I drink both 50/50 mix and water.

<p>What type of conditions do you ride in? Is it really hot? Are you drinking enough fluids? If you lose more than 2 pounds on a ride you're not drinking enough. What is your exertion level? Are you going too hard for too long for your fitness level?</p>

<p>Someone below also mentioned protein. Many of the 'higher end' sports drinks also come in a protein variety. The reading I've done at the very least suggests that you eat protein and carbs within 30 -45 minutes after a ride to maximize the recovery/refueling of your muscles.</p>

"When do bearings need to be replaced? ","41554","","<p>How do I know when bearings need to be replaced?</p>

<p>Should I go by time? Or is there a symptom to guide me? </p>
","<p>I refurbish a lot of older bikes for re-sale.  The first thing I do is to pop off the wheels and manually turn the axles to see if the bearings are suspect.  If the axle turns roughly, has side-to-side play, or is hard to turn...They probably do.   </p>

<p>There should be ""no more friction than supplied by the grease"" when turned by hand.  You cannot do this with the wheel on the bike.
If you have the tools; cone wrenches and such, then a wheel rebuild is both easy and cheap.  The best-grade #25 bearings are inexpensive.   If the cones are shot it's a different story.</p>

<p>Time?  My police patrol bike, with well over 3000 miles, still feels perfect.  If you ride in the rain a lot, or ride off-road through mud and sand and through water crossings, naturally you're going to need more frequent maintenance.

","<p>In general, hydraulic brakes should only need bleeding when the system has been ""opened up"" for some reason, or when a leak has either allowed air in or allowed enough brake fluid to drain out that the master cylinder is pumping air.  The ""need to bleed"" indicates a problem with the brakes.</p>

"Carbon bikes make me nervous. Can you ease the tension?","39570","","<p>Is it only me, or do Carbon bikes make others nervous!</p>

<p>I realize that carbon fibre is strong, but for some reason, having a bike that isn't made out of metal seems like asking for trouble.</p>

<p>My main reason for not liking it is the failure mode. Carbon won't bend like metal, but rather crack and snap in half. This makes me nervous.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. Over time a frame develops weaknesses. In a metal frame, these weaknesses would cause things to start bending. The bending would be noticeable and I would replace the part before it caused and accident.<br>
However carbon doesn't bend, and it will eventually just break.  This would most likely cause an accident.  I don't want my front fork to just snap as I'm riding down the road.</p>

<p>Is my concern warranted, or am I just unfamiliar with the technology?  How often should carbon parts be replaced?  What signs of wear should I look for?</p>
","<p>Watch the Tour de France...you'd be hard pressed to find a bike that is not carbon. Yes pros do get multiple steeds, but remember riding is their full time job. When was the last time one of us put 30-50 hours on a bike in a given week, never mind for 6-8 months! Now think about the wattage these guys put out and hopefully you are getting the idea...that carbon is a proven material.</p>

<p>Do failures happen? Yes, but the frequency is so minimal and when it does occur it is not the instantaneous snap in half you fear. Furthermore, no multi-million dollar corporation would be able to mass produce a product that posed as serious of risk as you suggest.</p>

<p>As far as carbon forks go, I use them on the road, as well as, cross and have never had a failure. Their ability to absorb vibration is unparalleled and I honestly cannot imagine riding a bike without one. I have a stable of bikes and all have carbon except one and that one has a suspension fork. My 29er MTB has a rigid carbon fork that replaced a ti rigid a couple years ago!</p>

<p>Now having said that, I have been riding carbon frames on the road for 5 years and the benefits are unbelievable. I used to have a carbon mountain bike and it was phenomenal. Carbon is not the end all and be all. There are other materials that ride extremely well. </p>

","<p>Wait a little before you buy a new saddle. It takes some time for both your butt and the saddle to adjust to each other. Wider and softer saddles are only more comfortable for shorter rides or very upright riding positions.</p>

<p>17 km and 50 minutes are a very good point to start. Depending on your time constraints and where you live you can either do longer trips (mostly training for your but), or go farther / steeper in the same time (what I prefer).</p>

<p>To build some basic stamina I believe everything between 30 and 60 minutes of real continuous effort (sweating, but not vomiting …) to be ideal. Maybe thats just because this is around the time it takes me to reach the different summits around here by road- or mountain-bike (the uphill part that is, add another 30 minutes to get to the starting point). Even only doing that once or twice a week should be enough to really make you feel progress kicking in rather fast.</p>

"Do the benefits of clipless pedals out weigh any danger they may pose the rider?","38916","","<p>As a newbie rider, I was asked by many experienced riders and bike shop experts if I was using clipless pedals yet?  The implication was you are not really a serious rider until you are clipless, sort of a rite of passage. No one ever told me you can break bones, but told 'everyone' falls a few times, count on it, and move on. </p>

<p><strong>Are there precautions or conditions where one could or should not use clipless pedal products?</strong></p>

<p>The previous year, I had ridden 1700 street and paved bike trail miles on a comfort bike and a Mountain tandem with Pedal Cages and never had an issue.  I incorrectly assumed I was ready to advance.  I purchased a new touring bike with Shimano M540's.  </p>

<p>Here is an <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGydA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XRAY of the damage I experienced</a> riding clipless.  It was an unexpected stop due to a flood closing a tame paved trail. Someone had painted a bright blue line from the trail up to where I fell (<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLpkU.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">me standing in the picture</a>).  It was my error in trying to ride around the obstacle and ended in the railroad ballast (2""-3"").  I had un-cliped going up but the M540's re-clipped  I stopped at the edge of the ballast but was clipped.  My ankle twisted > 150 degrees. It was my third ride and fall clipless. It all happened in 10-15 seconds.</p>

<p>I know through good friends of two very much younger but very experienced  riders who were hurt much more severely than I due to clipless.</p>

<p>Should I try again with the beginner clips and different pedals, or as my son and wife tell me, are you crazy?</p>

<p><strong>Revisited</strong></p>

<p>Having just rolled over 2,000 miles this year with flat pedals on the road I can report I have found a solid solution for me.  I now ride with <strong>""Pin"" Pedals</strong> available from several manufacturers I use (Xpedo MX Force 3).  These pedals have a grid work of short pins sticking up on both sides of the flat pedals. These pins rather lock my foot on the pedal preventing foot creep or shifting out of position while allowing for quick mount and dismounting as necessary.  </p>
","<p>I believe the first question you should ask yourself is this: Is some marginal perceived effiency gain worth the added risk of injury that clipless pedals provide? EVERYONE (including most of the posters in this thread, and surely any comments to this post as well) will give you dogma about how clipless pedals are better, more efficient and the defining trait that separates the amateurs from the pros. This is at worst dangerous misinformation, and at best a coercion of a preference. I asked a <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/14059/are-there-any-scientific-studies-proving-the-benefits-of-clipless-pedal-systems"">question</a> earlier about any scientific sources backing up the claim that clipless pedals are more effective than flat pedals, but the data that is available seemed to conclude that this is not the case, and pedal choice does not dictate the effectiveness of the pedaling.</p>

<p>Another spokesperson for using flat pedals is James ""Bikejames"" Wilson who has been a proponent for the use of them for a long time. He has compiled the self-titled <a href=""http://www.bikejames.com/strength/the-flat-pedal-revolution-manifesto-how-to-improve-your-riding-with-flat-pedals/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flat pedal revolution manifesto</a> which is a compilation of some of his blog posts about the subject of clipless and flat pedals. It is definitely worth reading for some good arguments for using flat pedals.</p>

<p>I personally believe that clipless pedals are best suited for racing, and that strapping yourself to such a finicky machine as a bicycle is an inherently bad idea. Searching through the databases of scientific journals does also give you quite a few hits in medical journals about studies of injuries related to the use of clipless pedals, something which I have yet to see for flat pedals. Judging by your post you do not seem to want to use clipless pedals for other reasons than the societal pressure to do so. I think you should give it all a good thinking, read the arguments, and then decide on what you feel is best for you. You should not let anyone persuade you to do something you are not comfortable with doing, if you do not feel that it makes sense for you. The type of bicycle pedal is one of the most important choices you can make in your life, and you should not leave it up to others to decide it for you. :)</p>

"Difference between road pedals and MTB pedals","38810","","<p>I am interested in buying some pedals I can clip into for my bike. I currently ride a mountain bike/hybrid but I ma looking to get a road bike next year some time. </p>

<p>What are the differences between road pedals and mountain bike pedals? Are road pedals suitable for my hybrid/MTB if I am only riding on roads?</p>
","<p>There are differences of opinion regarding what you are asking here. Some people are insistent that a road bike has to have proper road pedals, others think that for non-competitive riding over short distances the mountain bike style pedal is just fine, so long as you don't go all day in them and expect to win the Tour de France in them.</p>

<p>Let's look at the difference in shoes first. Road shoes have a huge cleat on the bottom of them that makes them not suitable for walking in off the bike. Meanwhile, mountain bike cleats are embedded in the sole and you can walk all day in shoes with them, just so long as you avoid polished wood floors that don't need to be scratched.</p>

<p>Cycling shoes have an upper and a sole. If you look at the market leading Sidi shoes the same uppers are available on both the mountain and the road versions. The soles are also remarkably similar, or at least the upper part of the sole. They have different rubber attached to the sole and different holes in them for the respective cleats.</p>

<p>Because of the different soles, with more rubber on the mountain variant, the best option for town riding is to get the mountain shoe. This is because you can ride them quite easily without being fully clipped in. With road soles this is not so easy to do, particularly in the wet, as you have to clip in properly before putting in any power strokes to get across that junction. They are also one-sided so you need to be adept to get into them. By contrast, you don't have to clip in with mountain bike pedals at all (if using Time Atac) and the cleat is always there for you as they have the cleat on both sides.</p>

<p>For where you are now, consider getting the mountain shoes, they have the same uppers and stiffness to the sole, if you pay for it (e.g. Sidi). You can also get more pliant shoes such as the Shimano affordable models that are stiff but not super-stiff. These can also be more presentable off-bike.</p>

<p>Remember that whatever pedal system you use the pedal, big or small still attaches to the same size hole in the chainset. Shoe stiffness with glass fibre or carbon fibre is huge so the platform size is not the be-all-and-end-all.</p>

<p>There is another choice to be made with the actual pedals. Shimano are the market leader with their SPD system, this has been earned not because it is a better pedal system. The other pedal system to look at is the Time 'Atac' range. This uses a smarter spring system that allows your feet to 'float' a lot more naturally. The 'Atac' pedal system is patent protected, the designer was the guy that designed the original road 'Look' pedal cleat system and I think it has a lot more going for it than the clunkier Shimano efforts.</p>

<p>Have a good look online for opinions regarding pedal choice/reliability and remember that most people defend their pedal system choice less than objectively. Generally shops will only stock the Shimano pedals or the 'Crank Bros' pedals and people that buy these will swear they have the best system.</p>

"How can I tell if a chain has a master link?","38703","","<p>I need to remove the chain on my internal-hub cruiser to clean it (i.e., no rear or front deraileur), and I'd rather not remove my back wheel if I can avoid that. What do I look for to find the master link?</p>

<p>Edit: Unfortunately, there's no differently-colored pin, and running my fingertips over the chain (both sides) didn't help. Do I have a one-piece chain? </p>
","<p>Usually when I talk about or hear someone use the term 'Master Link' they mean something like this:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mq6JS.jpg"" alt=""master links""></p>

<p>They are links that can be seperated without the use of a specialized chain tool to push a pin through the rollers.  There are others besides those shown, one of the more common being an SRAM Power Link which looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/373VL.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>If you don't have a link like those that is visibly different what you most likely have is a Shimano style HG or IG chain that requires the use of a chain tool to remove a pin from the roller.  Frequently the pins will have a little indentation where the chain tool seats.  When you break the chain with a chain tool, you normally reassemble it with a replacement pin that looks like this:</p>

"How do I deal with a dog chasing me when I'm touring?","38653","","<p>Once I was riding my road bike down a rural road. I heard barking over my shoulder and saw two dobermans running toward me. I can't think of a time in my life that I felt more endangered.</p>

<p>I reacted instinctively and accelerated. Unfortunately I was on a gravel road and going into a bit of an incline. There was no way I could outrun those dogs. I looked back over my shoulder and they were no longer chasing me. The cycling gods must have been smiling on me.</p>

<p>Another time, in a similar situation, a different dog ran along next to me, barking and baring its teeth. I maintained my speed and yelled at it (trying to assert some dominance) until it got tired of chasing me.</p>

<p>These two experiences have done a lot to put me off touring alone.</p>

<p>How do I deal with issues like this? </p>
","<p>Oh... where do I even start? I love dogs, I am crazy about them, too. I have 3 labs of my own. I am from a place where street dogs are very abundant. If you don't see any dogs in the next 100 yards, consider yourself lost! :D</p>

<p>I am barked at often, chased often, even confronted sometimes. I used to run away before, because it is what a normal guy does.</p>

<p>I learned a very big thing about dogs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They chase wimps. It's like what a bully does, going after the weakest target. So, <strong>don't</strong> you dare run when you are bullied. Take a bite instead but stand your ground. </p></li>
<li><p>They sense fear. If you are scared while approaching a dog, he is sure to suspect you and bark/chase you.</p></li>
<li><p>They love challenges. If they think you are a worthy adversary they will confront you either to be protective or to see who is stronger in the area.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Me, for a guy, who was constantly afraid of dogs, was suddenly in charge, after learning a little of these dog psychology tips. </p>

<p><strong>Therefore, please believe me when I am saying this</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I have never run away from a dog. (Unless I am very very late)</li>
<li>If a dog is chasing me, I hit my brakes hard, and stare right at it. Mostly he will not come forward, and bark from a safer distance, kinda like maintaining a line. So I can finally get moving slowly.</li>
<li>If dog is coming towards you even when you are standing ground. Get off your bike, show him <em>You are not going to wait around, when he is coming towards you</em>. 


<blockquote>
  <p>Show them, you are ready. Call it like ""Bring it on""</li>
  <li>After a stare down, **do not ** make a hasty move. (Got bit once by a shepherd this way.) Take it real slow. Be calm.</li>
  <li>Suppose that, despite your confrontation, the dog is heading towards you, accepting the challenge. Still, you have a big weapon: <strong>Your Cycle</strong>. Lift the front wheels high and start swinging it, right and left. That is sure to stop his pace to think a bit.</li>
  <li><p>If a dog passes this point, and still heading towards you then you are in a serious point. Where there are only three things to do.</p></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Surrender:</strong> Another  psychology of dogs, if they pass that point, they are challenging you <em>head on</em>. So, better lower your body, sit down. Let the dog be taller than you. Don't care about him, or look at him. Instead hook a headphone in your ear and listen to the music.  Music will calm your nerves down and send positive impulses for the dog to sense. Let him smell you. After few moments, just get up calmly grab your bike, start walking with it (but don't ride off) <strong>I have tried this so many times, its freaky but works</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Call for help: If the dog has an owner, (s)he may hear you if they are nearby. Or somebody might help you get out of this trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Get ready to fight: When nothing works, better get yourself prepared for the fight. From my own experience, dogs love to tear limbs. If they grab your limb, you just feel helpless. Avoid this</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h1>more on fight situation ....</h1>

<ul>
<li>Don't forget its an animal. Could be your last fight. </li>
<li>Pepper spray is handy as well if it comes to a fight - it's also useful for any muggers that might try for your wallet :) <sup>@Credit: Nate Koppenhaver</sup></li>
<li><p>Protect your <code>neck</code>, <code>hands</code> and <code>calf muscles</code> at all cost. If they are hurt you have very slim of escaping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be defensive, rather than offensive:</strong> Let him make the first move and on retaliation you can do whatever you want. Effective targets are <code>nose</code> and <code>eyes</code> they will buy you a lot of time and you can make a run for it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are lucky try to find a long stick. <strong>They are greatest weapons against dogs</strong>. Don't hit them. Just point it right at them and show them you will do it. Even a mini pump works, if you find nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't let him corner you, keep the motion going, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normally when this happens, me and dog are generally circling each other</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Make a little cage out of your bike. When you are cornered, this just might save your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Grabbing tail, makes him more angry, try to avoid that.</p></li>
<li>Grappling is only safe on the back of its neck. He can reach every other part.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to avoid all this?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dogs are very friendly creatures, you can be friends with them, no matter what. Treat them with respect.</li>
<li>Don't give them any reason to confront you.
<ol>
<li>If speed is the problem, <code>slow down</code></li>
<li>If big size is the problem <code>get off your bike</code></li>
<li>If he suspects you. Let him smell you. </li>
<li>Friendly look, with lovely hello, calms most of domestic dogs.</li>
<li>If you see a dog that is sure to bark on you, <strong>change your approach</strong>. Get off your bike, start walking with it</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the dog has a owner, better complain to them to have better control. </li>
<li>Report to the law, if owner is not helping you</li>
<li>Pack some treats, they are better as friends than adversaries. </li>
</ul>

<p>Do not scare a dog and run away. They become <strong>enemy for life</strong>. </p>

<p>Update: <strong>Rabid Dogs</strong></p>

<p>Getting into a fighting situation with a rabid dog, is more harmful than it should be. </p>

<p>One of my little story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my friend got into a similar situation with me, on a village cycle trip. A rabid dog was being chased by locals <sub>(its not abnormal here)</sub> and the dog out of fright ended up attacking us. My friend was a pretty agile cyclist, he immediately changed to defense position with his bike covering his entire body stopping the first attack. But, at a moment when dog was jumping at us, he used his elbow to hit the dog, but it bit him very badly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very torturous and painful moment we were in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Worst part <em>than the wound was the <strong>infection</em></strong>.</p>

<p>So, I suggest full <strong>defence</strong> no offence as much as possible, but if you are a fighter/ Martial Arts Expert or <strong>know how to protect yourself very well</strong>, then yes, <code>sick dog are very easy to knock down</code> just aim for the <strong>nose</strong>.</p>

"How to prevent wrist pain on road bikes?","38640","","<p>When I started bike-commuting with my road bike I developed chronic pain in my wrists. It probably took a year to go away, and now I have been free of complaints for several years. My wife just started bike-commuting with her road bike and she started to complain about painful wrists as well. <strong>I assume this has to do with holding weak wrists at an angle for an extended period of time</strong>. I was thinking about pointing her handlebars downward a bit, but am worried that she will slide off the grips mounted to the top of the handle bar (I don't know what those are called...) when she rides with her hands above the bar and has to brake abruptly. Something else we were thinking about trying is wrapping her wrists with elastic bandages, but we weren't sure if we were going to exacerbate or at least prolong the problem, since she would probably use her wrist muscles less.</p>
","<p>I switched bikes a year ago, and I noticed on my rides (50km - 70km) at the time that I had some numbness / cramp / pain in my hands and wrists, it was so bad on some rides that I need two hands to change gear.  The bike had slightly different geometry than my previous road bike.  I now ride frequently 100km and even up to 180km with little or no pain.</p>

<p>Here's what I did and what changed:</p>

<p>1) I took the bike to my LBS and asked them if there was something they could do.  The adjusted the shifters outwards so that I wasn't stretching so far to change gear. A good bike fit may be the only solution you need.</p>

<p>2) Good gloves with good padding in the right place, to prevent putting too much pressure on the nerves that run through your palm.</p>

<p>3) rotating hand position, on a road bike you have 3 (or possibly more ) hand positions.  Use them.  They are not always practical in every situation but you can often switch from the drops to the hoods or vice versa on the flat, and the hood to the tops or vice versa on climbs.  This change in position will help with cramping.</p>

<p>4) finger clenches and stretches.  As soon as I start to feel my wrists or fingers getting tired I take one hand at a time off the handlebars (where it is safe to do so) and clench and stretch my fingers 5-10 times.  </p>

<p>5) Hold the handle bars loosely.  My main problem was that I was gripping the handlebars way too tightly.  If you relax your grip to the loosest possible you will reduce cramp and reduce the effect of vibrations from small bumps and rough road surfaces.  This is especially important for long fast downhills.  I would grip on for dear life (doing about 60kmph - 75kmph) clearly you want a harder grip as even small bumps can be dangerous, but squeezing very hard on the handlbars will give you cramp in no time at all.  Also when breaking on the down hills its better to pump the breaks rather that keep them on the whole time.</p>

<p>All this takes practice and I am sure that the muscles in my wrists got used to the abuse they were getting too.  In the end I am fine.</p>

"Deep-Profile Carbon Wheels -- How to choose depth?","38630","","<p>I'm doing research for a future purchase of new wheels (for everyday riding) for a 2012 Cannondale CAAD10 Ultegra. I want to spend ~$1000 (give or take $200 or so). In my price range I've found: Boyd Cycling, Williams Cycling, November Bicycles, and Soul Wheels (a bit over price range). They all offer similar wheelsets for a similar price. Are there any other reputable brands I should be looking at as well? I'm specifically looking at carbon clinchers.</p>

<p>I live in Sacramento, CA (very flat city), am 6ft tall, 130lbs.</p>

<p>Two questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Now that I've identified some different brands, how do I choose between the brands?</li>
<li>How do I choose rim depth (38mm vs 50mm vs 58mm seem to be the commonly-used ones)?</li>
</ol>
","<p>The full answer depends on where you are riding, how you are riding, and the conditions you are riding in. Windy, winding, hilly courses that you tackle on a road bike with some friends would have me leaning towards a less deep set of wheels. A flat calm straight triathlon course on a tri-bike I'd want more depth.</p>

<p>With the wheels you are looking at, and the price range you are looking at, you aren't going to be getting into the newer shaped wheels (like the Zipp Firecrest and other similarly shaped wheels) that work especially well in cross winds...which means the depth will come into play if you are in a windy situation.</p>

<p>My bottom line would be go with shallower wheels unless you have hard reason to go deep. The slight aero benefit of the deeper wheels will be outweighed by the greater versatility of the shallower ones. With the exception of the latest tech in wheels (Firecrest shape) my #1 criteria is hubs...a great hub on a so-so rim is much better than a so-so hub on a great rim...keep that in mind when making final decision.</p>

<p>If possible, ride on a set of the wheels. Find a friend that has a set identical or similar to the ones you are thinking about and take them on a typical ride (not just a ten minute test).</p>

<p>Also: I've been recommending folks to consider semi-carbon (carbon with alloy braking surface). These are a bit heavier, but not much and you won't have to change brake pads moving back and forth.</p>

<p>Have fun, be safe.</p>

"Mixing different front and rear tires","38145","","<p>My used bike came with different front and rear tires. It appears to have some kind of Kenda commuter tire in the front, and Continental Country Ride in the rear. They are both the same size (700x28).</p>

<p>Is this perfectly acceptable or should a bike always have matching models (and/or size)?</p>

<p>My main concerns from mismatching tires:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grip thresholds may be inconsistent</li>
<li>Ride comfort? </li>
<li>Wear rates (but rears seem to wear faster anyway)</li>
</ul>
","<p>It's perfectly okay to run different sizes, brands, and types of tires on the front and rear.  As you note, rears will wear faster due to carrying more of the load.  The grip threshold is largely irrelevant, since the front and rear will be exposed to different forces and grip requirements.</p>

<p>The main concern is keeping within the range of a single tube size if possible, since otherwise you'd need to have twice the spares on hand.</p>

<p>At the extreme end, there are 69er and 96er mountain bikes that mix and match 29"" (622) and 26"" (559) wheels on the same bike as well as Terry women's bikes with 24"" (520) front wheels and 700c (622) rear.  By necessity those run very different tires front and rear.</p>

"Wired or Wireless bike computer?","38081","","<p>I have bought a new pair of road bikes.</p>

<p>I am a triathlete (Sprint mostly) and I am interested to know, what computer should I buy now? wired or wireless?</p>

<p>I mainly do not like wireless things (I don't do wireless accessories - they tend to fail on you when you most need them).</p>

<p>The reasons I may consider which type to buy will be:
- Price (wired usually lower)
- accountability - (wired will less fail)</p>

<p>I can only think of why NOT to buy a wireless computer, and would like to know your inputs as well please.</p>
","<p>A wireless computer is capable of all the functions of any wired computer and often more, since any currently sold higher end computer will have wireless as a feature.</p>

<p>A wired computer is capable of most of the same functions. The principle difference is the need to run wiring around your bike. This is a minor issue if you only have a front wheel speed sensor, but if you add cadence, or also use a generator hub, then the wiring paths will be quite busy, and difficult to make ""clean"" in appearance on your pretty new bike.</p>

<p>I generally recommend a wireless computer. A quality brand will be very simple to set up. They basically require zip tying the sensors in place, ensuring that the magnet which trips the sensor circuit is in the right place in relation to the sensor, and spinning the wheel to pair the unit. </p>

<p>Every brand has slightly different pairing instructions, and the more feature filled and pricey the unit is, the more necessary it is to follow the directions step by step. Radio interference is an issue that some early units had, but that has long since been dealt with, by encrypting the radio signal, and only recognizing data from the correct encryption and frequency.</p>

<p>Another advantage of the wireless computer is that if you have more than one bike you only need a couple of extra sensors and the wireless computer can easily be swapped from one bike to another. The Garmin 500 (and probably others) allow 3 different bikes to be setup on the one trip computer.</p>

<p>In short, do the wireless. They are just as reliable, just as easy or easier to set up, and look better on the bike. </p>

"Noticeable clicking from crankset or bottom bracket","38011","","<p>A few days ago I began hearing a clicking noise coming from the crankset and I can also sense a slight hitch when the right crank is at its upmost position just when it's about to go down.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that it only happens when pedaling. When i have the bike on the stand I cannot reproduce this no matter how hard I pull and bend the cranks in whatever direction.</p>

<p>I have already taken the cranks off and on again and re-tightened them but without any change. <strong>I am afraid that it could be the bottom bracket itself.</strong> Unfortunately I don't have the tools to tighten it or take it off.</p>

<p>The chainring is a Thimano model and has only one chainring (nexus hub shift in the back).</p>

<p>Is there anything else I could do or check for?</p>

","<p>I've had a similar clicking experience. Not really varying under different load, nor at a certain position of crank arms. Everyone I asked said to me it was the ball bearings in the bottom bracket.

"Can I combine different wheel sizes in one mtb?","37661","","<p>Imagine a mountain bike that uses a 29er fork with 29er wheel and a 27.5 wheel at the rear. Can this be realized and what are the pros and cons?</p>
","<p>You can do this and there are even bikes that are designed to do so, for example <a href=""http://www.bikerumor.com/2012/09/13/2013-liteville-mountain-bikes-updates-frames-w-scaled-sizing-mix-n-match-wheel-combos/"" rel=""nofollow"">this bike here</a> by a company called <em>Liteville</em>. This bike is not only intended to be used with mixed wheel sizes but does also allow to change the wheel sizes used.</p>

<p>So why would one want to do so? Without having explicitly searched for reasons, I would guess that one can use the advantages of the different sizes where they are needed: The bigger the wheel, the less prone it is to change its direction, giving you a more stable ride at high speeds and on not too curvy tracks. A smaller wheel on the other hand is more ""wobbly"" at high speeds but is stiffer and can handle higher impact forces. If you put those together on a bike with the bigger wheel in front and the smaller in the rear, you get a downhill bike that drives stable on fast and rather straight tracks, that can handle also take hard drop landings on the back wheel.</p>

<p>However, if you would try to do this with an average frame by just replacing the fork and mounting the respective wheels, you would quite surely end up with a mess. As the frame is designed for a certain wheel size in the front <em>and</em> back, all the angles between the frame parts are designed to give certain ride characteristics. If you just swap the wheel sizes, things like the head and seat tube angle will change significantly, giving the bike totally different handling characteristics. Normally those new characteristics will not fit into what one would call good handling.</p>

<p>To sum it up: one can try such thing with a random frame just for fun, but if one seriously wants to build such a bike, one has to start planing it from the frame geometry.</p>

"diference between 170mm 172mm 175mm crank arm length on road bike","37636","","<p>What is best for which use, advantage, or application, especially for climbing.</p>
","<p>Believe it or not in the range of lengths you are looking at there is very little scientific support for there being any real discernible differences in performance (both in absolute power and metabolic efficiency).  For the lengths you are considering I would suggest this is largely a personal preference choice.</p>

<h1>Crank length and maximal power</h1>

<p>If we are concerned about maximal power output,  there appears to be no significant difference for the crank length range commonly <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417428"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Martin and Spirduso 2001)</a>. The study used 16 <em>male</em> cyclists were tested for maximal power across crank lengths of 120, 145,170,195, and 220mm.  Only the extreme (120, 220mm) showed a significantly lower maximal power, but the effect size is small (around 4%).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvvgR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 - Maximal power as a function of  crank length (reproduced from <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417428"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Martin and Spirduso (2001)</a>).  Be careful of the Y-Axis scale, the effect size is actually small and error bars are large indicating a lot of individual variability.</strong> </p>

<h3>Choosing a crank length for optimal power</h3>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417428"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Martin and Spirduso (2001)</a> also attempted to create a formula for optimal crank length based on fitting a 2nd-order polynomial regressions to the subjects best power (response) as a function of the ratio of leg, tibia, and femur lengths to crank ratios (think inverse U cuvrve).  Leg and tibia lengths had support ($R^2$ of 20.5 and 21.1%), but the effect size was small (around  3%) and the relationship had a number of outliers.  That said, the regressions suggested a crank length that is 20% of your leg length or 41% of the tibia length.</p>

<p><em>As a side note, in terms of effect size, you can gain 5% through gear selection, using larger cogs (see <a href=""http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp50-2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spicer, 2000</a>).</em></p>

<h1>Crank length and metabolic efficiency</h1>

<p>Most cyclists are not producing maximal power on their ride.  Instead we tend to spend most of our time at sub-optimal output levels. In this case we might be more interested in the metabolic cost of cycling, and optimize the setup to be the most metabolically efficient. <a href=""http://jap.physiology.org/content/93/3/823.short"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">McDaniel et al 2002</a>, investigated the impact of a number of factors (including crank length) on metabolic cost. 9 cyclists were used in the study.  A smaller number of crank lengths were used (145, 170, 195 mm) compared to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417428"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Martin and Spirduso (2001)</a>.  Pedal rates were also investigated (40, 60, 80, 100 rpm).  </p>

<p>Overall, mechanical power strongly predicted metabolic cost (R^2 = 0.95; not surprising) and the authors used the metabolism residuals (left over variability) to investigate the impact of crank lengths, pedal rates, and pedal speed.  The used step-wise regression to attempt to build the best descriptive model (personally I think small-sample sized corrected AIC ranking would have been more appropriate).  They found independently each had some descriptive power, but overall the best descriptor was pedal speed (combination of crank length and pedal rate (cadence)).  Once pedal speed was accounted for the other factors (e.g., crank length) provided little descriptive power. Note that all of these factors will be related (i.e., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multicollinearity</a>) so it is not surprising on their own there would be some descriptive power.</p>

<p>In terms of metabolic cost, it would seem your pedal speed is what matters.  To quote the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main finding of this investigation was that mechanical power
  output and pedal speed accounted for 99% of the variation in metabolic
  cost at intensities below LT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that LT stands for Lactic Threshold (aka maximal aerobic capacity).  More importantly, they follow up and state (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mechanical power output alone accounted for 95% of the variation in
  metabolic cost, suggesting that, even with our wide range of
  pedaling rates, pedal speeds, and crank lengths, <em>muscles’ ability to
  convert chemical energy to mechanical work was remarkably stable.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Choosing your length</h2>

<p><strong>The take home is our body will adapt to the commonly used crank lengths, so you need to select base on other factors. While some will argue that  performance gains are possible,  these for the most part appear to be small, on the order of small drive train efficiency gains (e.g., using larger rear cog; see <a href=""http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp50-2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spicer, 2000</a>).  A common theme to me is that individual variability seems to be a much larger effect, therefore you will need to consider your personal situation.</strong> </p>

<p>If I had to suggest one potential selection criteria I would suggest considering if you like to spin or mash your gears.  If you like to spin, you will likely want a shorter crank length so you can turn your legs over faster.  If you like to mash, a longer crank length will likely feel better as you have more leverage.   As an aside, spinning can also be more efficient as you tend to use a larger cog in the back, which is known to be more efficient (<a href=""http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp50-2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spicer, 2000</a>). Why on earth modern cassettes use such small cogs I have no idea! I suspect weight at the cost of efficiency.</p>

Up until now, I've used CRC/WD-40 with an extension tube and attempted to squirt the lubricant into the tube housings. However, I suspect that this is fairly ineffective because 1. WD-40 is not a great lubricant (judging by the other Q+A on this site), and 2. the lubrication doesn't travel very far into the tubes.</p>

<p>So what is a good way of doing this?</p>
","<p>I use chain lube since I also prefer the solvent+grease wet chain lubes. That's exactly what you want inside cable housings. Popping the quick releases on brakes or frame attachments on gear cables, then dribbling chain lube along the inner so it runs down into the outer works well on cables that are already installed and doesn't require re-adjusting anything afterwards.</p>

<p>Many outers are pre-greased these days, and the way to fake that if you get cheaper outers is a grease gun. A syringe will work at a pinch, but it needs to be a small one or the force needed to squirt grease into the tiny hole in the outer will be extremely high. Trying to manipulate grease into a cable outer any other way is frustrating and I find it ineffective (I have tried!)</p>

<p>Using oil kind of works, but I find I need to re-oil the cables way too often. Grease works better. Teflon coated cables work even better, and the combo of teflon cables and pre-greased outers (or plastic-lined outers) is amazing. But not worth the $80 a set unless you're running 10 speed gears or something expensive (I use a Rohloff, and that doesn't care about fine adjustment, only cable friction).</p>

"How do you fix a puncture on tubeless tires?","37200","","<p>I recently got a new bike with a set of tubeless compatible rims. The stock tires are clinchers with tubes. I'm thinking about putting tubeless on there, but I don't have any experience with them. We have some trees here that drop huge thorns, like nails. They're big enough to go through any tire. When I get the eventual flat, how do I fix the tire? Are there patches? Can you just stick a tube in there?</p>
","<p>When putting tubeless tyres on I would definitely recommend that you use a sealant such as Stan's if riding somewhere with thorns. This would be your first level of defence. The sealant would seal up a thorn (or other) hole quickly and painlessly. </p>

<p>You can repair a tubeless tyre with a vulcanizing repair kit, but reseating a tubeless on the trail is very difficult. It is virtually impossible to do without 'shop air' (I haven't tried CO2) so carrying a tube is important for any major leaks. </p>

<p>You can simply run a tubless tyre with a tube until you get somewhere to properly fix the tyre.</p>

<p><em>Like everything else in the mtb world there are two schools of thought on whether you leave the thorn in or remove it, I would remove it. If you leave it in it plugs the hole but then if you ever do need to put a tube in you risk puncturing that also.</em></p>

"50/34 vs 52/36 crankset for 11-32 cassette (shimano 105 5800FC)","36996","","<p>Following up on this <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/28477/what-is-the-meaning-of-11-32-cassette-and-12-25-cassette"">enlightening answer</a>, I would like to know the differences between 50/34(compact), 52/36(mid-compact) and 53/39 (standard).
The cassette I am choosing is 11-32 to give me a wider flavour of gears but normally I don't use the lower(bigger teeth sprocket) gears, I've just trained like this. I put more power on small slopes rather than shifting down the gears. Thus, I was also thinking to go for 11/28 but then fixed 11/32 as my cassette.</p>

<p>What would be the best crankset to go with it? By default, its 50/34 but I can choose.</p>

<p>I am buying a cross bike from ROSE (DX-2000) and would mostly use it as a road bike for long distance (>100KM). I need a configuration where I can have the smallest gear possibility, in other words, I can put in maximum power and effort (which I miss in my current racing bike with Campagnolo Xenon 9 Speed set, I don't know the exact cassette configuration but its missing the few sprockets :D)</p>

<p>Thanks </p>
","<p>The difference is simply in the number of teeth on the chainring, and therefore the distance that the chain will travel when you turn the crank.  With the standard crank you will be pushing the chain further, and therefore given the same cassette, the standard chainring will provide longer gearing than a compact, and require more power to turn.  There are tables available which show the gear inches for different sizes of chainring and cassette.  Interestingly a 50/11 will provide a longer gear than a 52/12, meaning that a 50 tooth chainring and 11 tooth rear sprocket will be 'faster' than a 52 tooth chainring with a 12 tooth rear sprocket.</p>

<p>Importantly, you should consider what cassette goes best with the chainset you have chosen. A 34/30 gear is a very high ratio and is similar to what you would get from a triple crankset.  If you chose the compact chainset then it might be more appropriate to use a the 11/28 cassette.  Choosing a big widely spaced cassette like an 11/30 means the gears will be quite spaced out and you even if you have an 11spd cassette you might find there are times you cant get a gear which you can comfortably spin, or the change in cadence required to go from one gear to another is awkward. It will also mean you will need a longer cage rear mech, as the chain will need to be longer. </p>

"What is the difference between a “single-speed bike” and a “fixed-gear” bike?","36702","","<p>I would have thought that a single gear was the same as a fixed gear, but that does not seem the case.  What am I missing?</p>

<p>Can a fixed gear bike have more then one gear?</p>
","<p>A single speed bike has a single speed freewheel threaded onto the rear hub. The freewheel allows the rider to coast.</p>

<p>A fixed gear has a single cog threaded on the rear hub, along with a reverse threaded lockring, to prevent the cog from getting loose. The cog has no freewheeling action, so any time the wheel is moving, the pedals are moving too. This setup allows the rider to even ride backwards.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, fixed gear bikes have only a single gear. There are some setups however where instead of a single gear at the rear a special <a href=""http://surlybikes.com/parts/dingle_cog/"">dingle</a> with two cogs is placed in, and a pair of chainrings is up front, and the tooth difference between the chainrings is the same as the tooth difference in the cogs. Then, the rider can change gears for different riding, however it requires dismounting, loosening the rear wheel, and manually moving the chain from one set of cogs to the other.</p>

<p>There are also some 3 speeds or other internally geared hubs that have been owner modified to be multi-speed fixed hubs, but they are very, very rare.</p>

"Better solution for uncomfortably low bars: a stem riser, or taller stem?","36601","","<p>I've got my (threaded) stem at the maximum height, but I'd be more comfortable if the bars were higher relative to the seat. It would be uncomfortable to lower the seat any further.</p>

<p>I was intrigued by the idea of a stem riser as a cheaper solution than a taller stem, or a larger frame.</p>
","<p>Stem risers do work but have limitations. They increase the amount of force you can put on the headset (as does anything else that gets the handlebars further up), they can break (unlikely but possible), they add a little slop and they often creak (a consequence of the slop). If you're a strong guy with wide handlebars and you're prone to really grunting on the bars you're more likely to break a riser (or anything else), and will probably find the small amount of extra slop makes the bars feel loose (or as though they're about to break).</p>

"Are there advantages of dedicated bike computer instead of smartphone apps?","36522","","<p>I do a lot of road biking. I have a basic Catseye onboard computer for my speed and odometer. But I also use my iPhone to track and record my biking. I've tried a variety of iPhone apps, the best ones being iMapMyRide and Cyclemeter.</p>

<p>As I get more serious with biking though, I'm looking around at the dedicated biking computers like the Garmin Edge. I'm trying to figure out if they are worth buying or not. Rewind the clock back about 5 years and I'd say definitely yes. But these days, with really awesome GPS-capable smartphone apps, I'm not so sure...</p>

<p>Take for example iMapMyRide. You can buy a cheap ANT+ adapter for your iPhone and then use any ANT+ device with the software. Speedometer, cadence, heartbeat sensor, etc...</p>

<p>Also with these apps it does optional Live Tracking so that when you are out on your ride, your spouse (or anyone you want) can look at a webpage and see your progress on a map. You can do this with the Garmin Edge apparently but I think Garmin charges $25 a year or something for that service.</p>

<p>So if I already have an iPhone/Android and I already take it on rides anyways (for emergencies), then <strong>is it worth it at all to get a dedicated biking computer?</strong> Just about the only advantage I can think of is that the biking computers are smaller (less weight).</p>

<p>Are there any outstanding advantages to dedicated computers that I'm unaware of?</p>
","<p>I recently thought that my smartphone would replace my bike computer, but have come to the conclusion that the bike computer is better. </p>

<ul>
<li>One is that the phone is much larger.</li>
<li>Second is mounting. (Whether a suitable mount is available depends on the phone model.)</li>
<li>Third, and this is important... is that smartphones are not designed to sit out exposed to hot sun, extreme temps, and rain; all of which commonly occur in serious cycling.</li>
<li>Fourth is ease of use. My bike computer was specifically designed to sit on the handlebars with easy access to most all functions and in typical cycling conditions. The smartphone is not.</li>
<li>Fifth, my smartphone is important to my professional life. So, having it destroyed in a bike crash would not be good at all. </li>
<li>Sixth, definitely battery life; although I suppose this depends on the particular phone. (On a recent century+, my riding partner brought along 3 extra batteries and used them all, for his HTC Evo...and my bike computer was still humming along at the end of the day)</li>
</ul>

<p>A few months back, I bought a smartphone handlebar mount and case which all looked fine in the comfort of my basement. Anyway, once on the bike and in real conditions, it was unusable. The worst thing was that in the glare of sun, I couldn't even see the screen. Also, changing functions was a pain because of the case. Anyway, I rapidly went back to my bike computer. </p>

"Clicking sound coming from pedals/pedal spindle/crank","36073","","<p>I recently bought a Trek 4300 series MTB, but after only several weeks of use, I'm getting a clicking sound coming from both sides of the pedals.</p>

<p>It seems particularly pronounced when more torque is applied, e.g. going up a hill or when accelerating.
It seems to come from the pedal/pedal spindle area but it could be coming from the crank arms.</p>

<p>How do I go about identifying what the problem is and rectifying it?</p>
","<p>Papuass is correct - take it back to the shop as it is under warranty and they may have offered you a free service anyway.</p>

<p>Here is the complete checklist for future reference... </p>

<p>I believe that you have a Shimano Altus chainset - a pressed steel number with no chainring bolts to come undone.  </p>

<p>As for diagnosis, you are not getting the click when you are freewheeling - that is normally a simple check to do first.  </p>

<p>Next, try different chainring - does the click only happen in the outer ring? This can be due to the front mech touching the crank. Also check the mech clears the outer ring with the cage staying away from the teeth.   </p>

<p>Now try the granny ring - this will not be using the same 'chainring bolts' and will identify if the problem is there - this I do not suspect in your case due to the construction of the chainset.  </p>

<p>Now try and pedal out of the saddle - do you still get the click? Sometimes the seat post can creak as you pedal and you need to check that is not it.  </p>

<p>Stiff link? If the click on each power stroke then it is unlikely to be the stiff link going through the chainset as this will be  different each time.  </p>

<p>Now for checking the pedals. There should be a smidgen of grease on the pedals and inside the crank arms. With a 15mm spanner you can take them off, check the grease and put them back in again. The pedals should be in really tight, you may want to wear a tough glove whilst putting your pedals in/taking them out. This is because you can mangle your hand on the chainset quite easily doing this. Remember that the left hand pedal has a left hand thread and the right hand pedal has a right hand thread - it is important you turn the right way.  </p>

<p>Now for the bottom bracket. Get a socket set - 15mm and check the crank arms are on massively tight.</p>

<p>Check the pedals for wear/general condition and decide whether you need to tighten up the bolts holding the cages onto the bodies. There should be some play with affordable pedals - the bearings do not have to be great - but if there is too much play consider tightening them up with the socket set, or, better still, just get a new set of pedals, maybe upgrading yourself to Shimano SPD/Time ATAC.</p>

<p>If that has not cured it then check the bottom bracket is inserted properly. The chances are that you will need brand specific specialist tools for this, including a crank removal tool. Again you will have left hand thread on one side and right hand side on the other side. Make sure you are not doing up when you think you are trying to take off the bottom bracket.  </p>

<p>With modern 'cartridge' bearing bottom bracket sets (you have one of these with octalink) it is unlikely to be penetrated with dirt/grime (giving rise to noise) but older square-peg bottom brackets can have problems with ball bearing cages falling to pieces and making quite a racket. Usually these can be repacked with new balls and grease, however, you might want to put in a new b/b - this will need to be the correct outer shell length and axle length - see your existing b/b for numbers.</p>

<p>There is an outside chance that there may be something up with the frame, older cr/mo frames sometimes have a really basic tube for a bottom bracket that can make itself ovaloid over time. This you can only determine with the b/b fully stripped out and when you try to put it in again.</p>

<p>With fairly accessible tools you can get most of the bolts tight, this may cure it and save you the 'trek' to the bike shop. Given your warranty situation you can return it to the shop and let them make a decision on how much they want to strip the bike down.</p>

"Rear derailleur shifting poorly, skipping gears","35773","","<p>I've got a Shimano Sora on a 8-gear cassette, and have odd behavior and skipping, shifting under stress. </p>

<p>This started with a trip to the mechanic for a tune up which replaced the chain. I had some skips so I replaced the cassette. Still more skipping, a second trip to the mechanic didn't do much good.</p>

<p>I tried adjusting it myself and found some odd behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>Had to adjust the H screw way out, and it doesn't seem to reliably return to the same spot while pedaling (while working on it).</li>
<li>When I start at the smallest gear and shift to the largest, everything looks perfectly aligned.</li>
<li>When I start at the largest gear and shift to the smallest, the first click does almost nothing. The second goes to the 7th gear, third click to the 6th... and the seventh click skips from the 3rd gear to the first.</li>
<li>After all this, it doesn't seem to move back into the original position without a little push.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas on what's going wrong here? It seems like tension pulling the chain out is not sufficient, but I don't see any adjustment for that.</p>

<p>Am I barking up the wrong tree?</p>
","<p>A tune-up fundamental SHOULD be the proper alignment of the rear derailleur hanger. If the shop doesn't use a Park Tool DAG-1 [derailleur hanger alignment gauge], or some other manufacturer's, to inspect, verify, and correct the relation of the hanger to 3 different points on rim of rear wheel at 180 and 45 degrees apart it is throwing parts at a bike. As the hanger should hold the rear derailleur in direct line with each cassette chain ring, any deviation -- inward or away from the cassette -- induces erratic shifting and skipping that mimics cassette and chain wear.  (Misalignment is difficult to ""see"" without this tool but may be suspected if the bike has been bumped in a rack, dropped, or fallen, on the drive side.)  The tool at $65 to $75 will be used for diagnosis by a careful shop but is unlikely to be worthwhile for an occasional home wrench.      </p>

"What are the risks of untrued wheels?","35220","","<p>I understand that wheels should be trued for efficiency. Are there any safety risks (or risk  of damaging the bike) in using untrued wheels?</p>

<p>Are the risks different between wheels untrued left-right and up-down?</p>

<p>My question is motivated by the following fact: I have an up-down untrued wheel and not much time to take it to the shop, should I keep using the bike?</p>
","<p>It is important to understand that spokes work in tension rather than compression. What that means is that the spokes at the bottom of the wheel are not 'doing anything'. The load is shared by all of the spokes to varying degrees and, particularly with cross-laced spoking patterns, that load gets dynamically transferred to use the strength of the available spokes. You can actually knock out a chord of a dozen spokes on the cheapest of steel rimmed wheels and the wheel will still be able to support your weight and get you home, albeit with gingerly riding style with no kerbs or potholes attempted...</p>

<p>Therefore, even quite seriously mangled wheels that are as true as a poppadom are surprisingly strong when riding on paved roads in a straight line. As other contributors have noted the problem comes with the brakes and stability at speed. You really do want to make sure your brakes are not hitting the tyre or falling off the bottom of the rim. If you have the slightest doubt then you can ride the bike using the other brake as your primary, using the brake on the affected wheel for 'emergencies only'. This should not be a problem if the weather is dry and you know what you are doing.  </p>

<p>Straightening out the wheel need not be something that you need to get the bike shop to do. Consider doing it yourself, with a spoke key on the wheel in situ. Here is a handy page on how to do just that:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/skills/spokes.htm"">http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/skills/spokes.htm</a></p>

"How long is the life cycle of a bicycle?","35135","","<p>This may not be a particularly practical question, but I wonder how often do you find yourself looking for a new (or another) bike? There are, of course, two main aspects of it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mechanical decay. If you drive a car, you know to lube it every 3000 miles, rotate tires every 7500 miles, flush the fluids every 30000 miles. If you are reasonably serious about riding a bike, you'd place yourself at wherever you are comfortable in terms of maintenance from being unable to adjust your saddle height to re-assembling your own spokes and hubs, but you'd do some maintenance, anyway. Most components would have reasonably well-defined span they will serve, and would probably start falling apart after this many miles, even with reasonable maintenance and repair. What would the range in time and/or miles be for commuter bikes? road bikes? mountain bikes? Or are the modern bikes of say $1000 and upwards basically perpetual, unless you ride one heads-on into a concrete wall?</li>
<li>Needs change: you outgrow your bike, your riding pattern changes, you switch from group rides to triathlon, you move to a new area, you hand down your bike to your younger sibling, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a gut feeling that the latter is far more likely to happen than having the bike used up to its full mechanical resource. Any opinions?</p>
","<p>Let's try to steer this into some kind of sensible question with the perspective as seen from a typical bicycle shop workshop and what is on the road. </p>

<p>In a bike workshop you can find yourself working on bikes that can be up to fifty years old with a large quantity of them being more than ten years old. Some of these bikes have not been out of the garden shed for the last five years and have suddenly came into use because the owner's son or daughter has started riding.  Therefore this question very much depends on how often the bike gets an airing, how it is stored and how much it gets maintained.</p>

<p>For the person using their bike every day for commuting, the lifetime of the bike is an economic question. After five years or so, even with brake block changes, new cables, maybe the odd new set of sprockets, new tyres, replacement chains and plenty of t-l-c, the bike will suffer all-over wear that costs almost as much as a new bike to put right. Wheel rims will wear through, saddles will get torn,  bits of 'Shimano plastic' will go missing and the whole drive-train will get worn.</p>

<p>Fixing these problems will typically necessitate another round of consumables, e.g. chain, cables, brake blocks and tyres. All of these are more expensive as spares that you have to put time into fixing or pay a shop to fix. Meanwhile, at OEM prices, pre-fitted to a new bike, a better deal can be found. The existing bike has 'depreciated' to become a liability much like how an old car does. </p>

<p>If you look at the cars people drive you will notice that there are not too many 'Ford Cortina' models on the road. (UK) There are not too many 'Ford Sierra' models on the road either. Yet, there was a time when every other car was one of these models. There are one or two of these left and you do see them once in a blue moon, so clearly it was possible to service them and keep them on the roads forever. However, that did not happen for 99.9% of these once popular Ford cars.</p>

<p>Now have a look for what people actually ride. There is a reasonable selection of twenty year old models on the roads used by people on the commute or taking the dog for a walk. However, depending on where you live, the majority of bikes are recent, i.e. less than ten years old. Half of those are very new, less than three years old. Most of these 'daily riders' are well on their way to being used up as a 'mechanical resource'.</p>

<p>As for your point 2), in the UK many bikes get abandoned by their riders when they take up driving. Before people get to that age they do go through a series of bikes that they grow out of. Competitive riders are different again, typically they have a fleet of bicycles and a ludicrous amount of spare parts left over from upgrades.</p>

<p>To summarise, a bike will have a lifetime of approximately five everyday-riding years before it gets shot to pieces. This lifetime can be extended indefinitely through new components and diligent maintenance (or instantly shortened in the case of a crash). In reality people can ride bikes long after the bike is past its best, they can also put the bike into storage for long periods of time and they can also get into the sport (to purchase many bikes that don't necessarily get worn out).</p>

","<p>This is not uncommon with the old Shimano components.  I had the same front derailleur and 105 STI 9-speed shifters and I had to really crank it to go into the larger cogs.  The bike shop replaced the cabling (there wasn't much housing) and that really didn't help all that much, though I wish it did.  The problem sort of fixed itself when I purchased a new bike with modern components.  2009 or later shimano 105 (shifters and derailleurs) are much, much easier to shift up through the cogs.  Just push the button and it takes care of the rest.  No having to push on it to get it to the next cog.</p>

"Most effective upgrades on Road bike","34729","","<p>Earlier this year I purchased my first road bike (a 2013 - Felt F75). I had never really ridden before, so I didn't want to spend <strong><em>too</em></strong> much money up front not knowing how much I would actually ride. All in all, I think I'm riding more than I really ever thought I would.</p>

<p>My question is this:</p>

<p>If I wanted to start upgrading components on my bike, generally speaking, where can I get the most bang for my buck right off the bat? I've heard that getting new wheels can make a night-and-day difference in some cases, but didn't hear much evidence to back that up.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Here is the spec list for the F75 for reference:<br>

","<p>looking at your bike, which I basically see as a alu-105 setup (albeit a good setup, Felts are lovely bikes), I can suggest a few things but right away I'll say I don't think there is a ""magic bullet"". In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>wheels, as you say. On a lot of low-to-mid-range bikes, you just need to look at what wheelset they have to realise that this is where the manufacturer is keeping costs down. Obviously this goes away as you climb the range but whichever way you look at it, the better the wheels, the more expensive they are. For example I upgraded my wheels last year, but the ones I got cost me 50% of what I paid for the bike, over 1000GBP. <em>(In fact I started off with near enough the same question as you just asked, and this was my answer.)</em> So, relatively speaking, a lot. However, purely performance-wise, this is probably one of the best upgrades you could do. As with most things cycling, you're paying for lightness and aerodynamics. </li>
<li>groupset. Your bike has 105 components, you could always upgrade your components to Ultegra.  <em>(I'm thinking specifically of the 10-speed mechanical Ultegra rather than the 11-speed or electronic versions here.)</em> The plus side here is that you can do this in a piecemeal manner, so they will fit to your budget/timeframe, the downside is that these parts work out a lot more expensive if bought separately than they would if they came on a new bike. That's just down to economies of scale. A further possible downside is that you won't notice much difference! 105 ain't a bad groupset.</li>
<li>keep saving until you can upgrade the frame itself. You always have the option to go carbon.</li>
<li>how much are you interested in the actual mechanics of your bike? In terms of maintenance, for example. Some people hand their bikes off to the bike shop, other people do things themselves (or would like to). If you're in the latter category, a decent tool set perhaps? Plus of course this type of ""upgrade"" would last you for life.</li>
<li>lastly not so much the bike itself but peripheral stuff like getting good clipless pedals, if you don't already have them, more comfy shoes etc. Perhaps, if it turns you on, a gps-enabled trip computer. Personally I love the ""data"" aspect, and a Garmin 800 was top of my ""next cycling purchase"" list for a very long while, of course it doesn't make me any better a cyclist but to be able to look at all my rides retrospectively certainly adds to <em>my</em> enjoyment. Perhaps also smaller bike parts such as a better saddle etc. Obviously there are no big bangs here, but if you're budget-driven....</li>
</ul>

<p>I think which, if any, of these you choose is ultimately going to be down to how you see yourself using your bike going forward. Are you wanting to get faster? ride longer? go touring? compete? etc. etc. etc. </p>

<p>Likewise you could look at every suggestion and decide that none of them is worth it.</p>

<p>Why do they exist? I've heard they are just a bi-product of the manufacturing process.</p>
","<p>Note the technical term for what you are calling ""hairs"" is ""vent spews.""<em>[1]</em> As the name indicates, they are a consequence of an important detail of the tire fabrication process.</p>

<p>While liquid rubber is being injected or otherwise forced into the tire mold, air bubbles can form in the rubber or between the rubber and the mold. These bubbles can cause the finished tire to be weakened or malformed. To prevent that, tire manufacturers place vent holes in the mold to allow the air to escape under pressure. Necessarily, some rubber will get forced into these holes, forming the vent spews upon curing (which is the process by which the tire rubber converts from liquid to solid).</p>

<p>These vent spews serve no useful purpose; conversely, they can be removed without consequence.</p>

"How to fix a detached brake cable?","34343","","<p>My rear brake cable detached yesterday while riding. When I pull the level all the way back (which I can now do with no tension), I think I can see the end of the brake cable inside the brake hood, but it's no longer being pulled by the lever. </p>

<p>2 Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a common problem? It seems like the cable shouldn't detach easily, but if something is wrong either equipment or technique-wise I'd like to correct it post haste</li>
<li>Is there a way I can re-attach the cable without disassembling and re-taping my handlebars? (My bike has standard road drop bars)</li>
</ul>
","<p>Without pictures or a better description, it's hard to know if it was a failure of the cable or the brake lever. If the brake lever has broken and can no longer grasp on to the end of the cable, you'll need to replace the lever itself. However, a more likely scenario is that either the nub on the end of the cable that the lever holds on to has come off. You may also have a lever where the nub can pop off of if there's no tension in the cable, which can happen if there's too much friction in the cable housings. This may also be caused by the cable having become detached from the brake: you're pulling the lever, but it's not attached to anything.</p>

<p>The quickest and easiest thing to do is try to simply re-cable the bike. This can be done quickly (time: 15m) and cheaply (cost: $10), and in doing so will also help diagnose if the problem is deeper. You should also go ahead and re-cable the other brake lever and the shifters as well — if this was caused by a failure in the cable, the other cables may be ready to fail as well.</p>

<p>To get the cable out of the brake lever, pull the brake lever until you can see the cable, or where it should be. Find where the cable comes out of the other end of the housing and push it through until it comes out through the handle. To replace it, just thread the new cable back through and clamp it on the brake. It should look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DkqrG.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>If you feel a lot of friction pulling the cable out or installing the new one, you should replace the housings. This will take a little bit more time (45m) and some more money (housings: $10, bar tape: $15), but is still pretty easy to do. Unwrap your handlebars and re-insert the brake cable, replacing the old housings as you go. Wrap the handlebars back up, and you should be all set.</p>

<p>If the nub end of the brake cable isn't being gripped by the brake lever, or the piece to do so is missing, you will have to reinstall a new brake lever. This will be a good bit more expensive, and will also require that you re-wrap the handlebar tape.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

"how to reassemble mountain bike rear wheel hub and bearings","34103","","<p>So I thought I would sort out my wheel bearings (after asking a few questions here first).  Did the front without much of a problem, (reused the existing bearings at the moment, had not got round to going to the LBS to get new ones).  I tried to do the rear wheel tonight. </p>

<p>So I got the wheel off, took the quick release out.  undid one side of the axle (disk brake side I believe), took out the bearings etc.  I noticed that a few of the bearings from the cassette side had fallen out while taking the other side off. I then used the chain whip and other bit thing (who's name I can not remember) to eventually undo the cassette (was on real tight).  Took everything apart (trying to remember the order, even placing things in rows of where it came from) and cleaned it all up.  Went to put it back together again and I can not figure out at all (not with any confidence) how the bearings go into the cassette side under the locking nut (think its called that, the bit that comes off with the chain whip and tool).</p>

<p>Here are all the bits and the wheel.  Think I may have to admit defeat and go the LBS to get it sorted but they had a 5 or so day wait.  I am hoping someone might be able to guide me in the right direction to get this working again please.</p>

","<p>While not necessary, it will probably be easier to understand what is happening if you lift the cassette off. The ring at the front of your photo (C) is the nut that holds the cassette on, so right now you should be able to lift the cogs off the freewheel. That will leave you with the splined body of the freewheel exposed and you'll have one less distraction.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/01DNf.jpg"" alt=""bicycle rear wheel bearing parts""></p>

<p>The parts labelled are :</p>

<p>A: cone locknut (the last thing to go on)</p>

<p>B: seal, probably from the drive side</p>

<p>C: cassette nut/lockring that holds the cassette together and onto the freewheel</p>

<p>D: spacer/washer that goes between A and E</p>

<p>E: cone with seal attached</p>

<p>F: seal from the axle and cone labelled H</p>

<p>G: seal from the non-drive side</p>

<p>H: axle with cone attached.</p>

<p>I: there is no I</p>

<p>J: washer. I have no idea where this goes.</p>

<p>K: quick release axle.</p>

<p>Ignoring the bearings for a minute, the order things go back in from the non-drive side (underneath, in the photo) of the wheel is likely to be: Put the seal F back on H from the long side - it probably should not go all the way to the washer. Push H up into the wheel screw E down onto it then add D, screw A down and lock it off. Push G over the non-drive side cone assembly to seal that side. Push B into the drive side if it fits (I'm not sure it will, I haven't seen a seal like that or in there for a very long time). Put the cassette cogs back on, then add C to lock them in place.</p>

<p>Before doing this you will have cleaned the old grease off the cones in the hub (careful with solvents, you don't want to wash the grease out of the rest of the freewheel), then put in new grease and pushed new bearings into it (the grease holds the bearings in place while you reassemble).</p>

"What height should drop handlebars be - relative to my saddle?","34065","","<p>I've done most of my cycling with flat handle bars on a mountain bike. I'd like to start commuting to work though and am considering getting a road bike with drop handle bars.</p>

<p>The thing is though, I tried a bike in the past that had drops and didn't really find them comfortable. I hardly used the drops because it felt uncomfortable. This meant I usually kept my hands on the tops of the bars, and then that has the problem that I couldn't get to the brakes as quickly as I could with the flat bar bike I had.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had the drops set up at the wrong height when I tried them. What height should the drops be relative to the saddle?</p>
","<p>There is no single official accepted guidance. Typically the more you ride, the lower you will tolerate your bars, drops or straights. Pro cyclists have them as low as 10-15 cm below saddle, while amateurs tend to have them level or slightly higher than the saddle.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you cannot spend all your time in drops. Even pro cyclists prefer the more upright position with hands on top of the bars, and will typically go to drops only in critical moments (when in the front, in a breakaway etc.)</p>

<p>The thing with the brakes -- well, that's just the way it is with road bikes and drop handlebars. For giving up immediate access to brakes you gain more hand positions on the bars, which helps immensely on long rides. With your hands in the convenient ""on the horns"" position, typically you will be able to apply enough pressure to the brakes to slow down, though for emergency braking you'll need to get down to the drops.</p>

<p>You can get an adjustable stem to experiment with handlebar height. Just change it for a normal stem once you decide, or other road cyclists will look down on you -- an adjustable stem is pretty much the mark of a ""Fred"" :-)</p>

"Why don’t fixed gear bikes have brakes?","33968","","<p>It seems to be assumed you will not have any brakes on a fixed gear bike, why?</p>
","<p>The reason is historical.  Fixed gear bikes have been traditionally used for track racing, long after most other bikes had switched to using freewheels.  In the high-speed velodrome environment, it would be dangerous if the rider in front of you could brake suddenly:  you would crash into them, and likely most of the group behind you would join in the fun (this is also true in a paceline or peloton on normal roads).  So brakes have always been banned, and aren't really needed on the track anyway.</p>

<p>But track bikes sometimes get retired to road use.  And as fixed gear has gotten more popular, many frame makers are building similar bikes for the road.  Some of them are closer to track bikes (no brakes), others might include front brakes or both front and rear.</p>

"What tint colors are most useful for cycling sunglasses?","33438","","<p>There seem to be a lot of different lens options for sunglasses, and there must be objective differences.

<p>Would it be adequate to stick to neutral-colored filters (which would presumably be ideal for enjoying the scenery), or do any particular colors provide a significant advantage?

","<p>There are many factors that influence choices. -  terrain you ride, sunlight intensity, shade effects etc, and personal preference. A quick internet search will give you technical answers on what colors do <a href=""http://www.allaboutvision.com/sportsvision/lens-tints-chart.htm"">look here </a>. </p>

<p>For me personally, I mostly Mountain Bike, I live in New Zealand, which has extremely high UV light levels. Therefore I do not venture out for more than an hour without some protection. I will use different glasses for different rides, but only because I have them. For use while riding, the all rounder is Yellow, for other things as well, I would head towards amber. If correct color perception is important, then you will struggle to get glass that work as well as Yellows/Amber's - especially in low light.   </p>

<p>The advantage of the blue filters (blue blockers) is they lift depth perception and contrast - maybe roadies don't need it, but off road MTB it is a definite advantage.   </p>

<p>Clear - I use these where protection from things other than sunlight is desirable (insects, sticks, dust etc), and maximum use of available light essential - mostly night riding. </p>

<p>Yellow - I use these a majority of my riding. Do a great job at smoothing the transition from shade to full sunlight (i.e. I can see into dark forest from bright sunlight). On bright days, let too much light in for comfort (But still protect from damaging UV). Mine are specific sports style - not really a fashion accessory.... </p>

<p>Amber - Similar to yellow, but filter more light, making the shade a bit darker. Probably my most versatile sun glasses - use them when the yellows will look dorky -rides with family, beached etc. </p>

<p>Blue/polarised -  Better color perception so I use the driving, fishing and general wear. Mine are pretty much towards the ""fashion"" end of the style range, not good for riding - too dark for forests.   </p>

<p>I'm curious of the benefits of a fat tire beyond the obvious off-roading capabilities. Is it just a weird fad or is there some benefit of a fat tire vs a hybrid or a road bike?</p>
","<p>What you're witnessing is probably a mixture of convenience and all-around-increased popularity of fat bikes, rather than actual 'benefits'</p>

<p>A lot of people don't have the luxury of owning multiple bikes: one for the road, one for grocery trips, one for cross country, etc. If someone only has the resources for one bike, and they chose a fat bike because they like the versatility, you can understand why they would take that bike to the store. It's easy to argue that a fat-bike can go off-road, on the snow and sand, and of course to the store. A road bike cannot do all of that.</p>

<p>Also, wide tires are generally more comfortable. I could shed some weight and increase my speed a little by running ~30mm tires, but I choose to run 40mm tires most weeks because they handle bumpy roads and gravel with comfort and ease.</p>

","<p>The wobbling could come from the fork. This is easy to check by putting a finger between two parts of the headset (as you can see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX53M5ysmo"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, around 0:35 ). If you brake and feel movement, problem is for sure on the headset.</p>

<p>If you do, is the headset the correct size, BOTH for the frame and for the tube? And are they in good shape? These parts have low tolerances because they have to fit the frame and the fork tube very tightly, and different manufacturers have slight different dimensions.</p>

<li>Bent or cracked tubing. The odd dent is fine, but if a bike has obviously been bent in an accident I scrap the frame. Same goes for tubes with any cracks in them, even if it's fixable. Obviously any carbon frame with cracks is worthless.</li>

"Can any bike crankset be exchanged for another?","32336","","<p>I have a Specialized HardRock from the '90s.  It's seen better days, but I got it for cheap.  I had a bike shop look it over, but for some reason the guys missed the rounded off teeth on the front gears.  Whenever I ride it, the chain slips every few rotations.  I'd like to get a new crankset, but i'm not quite sure what will work and what won't.  Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.  </p>
","<p>The main intercompatibility issues with cranksets are the connection between the crank arms and the bottom bracket spindle.</p>

<p>Most bikes from that age (not to say all mountainbikes) use square taper bottom bracket, for which is very easy to find good quality cranksets.</p>

<p>These look like the leftmost spindle in the picture above (which also show newer types, that are less likely to be what you need):</p>

<p><a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/bbsize.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://sheldonbrown.com/bbsize.html</a></p>

<p>Other compatibility issues might be related to the length of the bottom bracket and the length for which the crankset was designed. Using different-sized bottom brackets and cranksets might result in a misaligned chainline, an ill-working front derailer, or in extreme cases a chainring running too close to the frame. This is so for tapered square, but I am not sure about the other types. </p>

"How long should MTB disc brake pads last?","32329","","<p>I'm fairly new to mountain biking and I was able to put in around 900 miles on my first set of brake pads on my Giant Anthem X2. At that point they started grinding metal on metal. I went and bought new Shimano pads (I have Shimano brakes) and after only 100 or so miles one of the front ones has already worn out. </p>

<p>The last time I rode the bike was in rain and mud so I'm not sure if that contributed to it.</p>

<p>How long do the brake pads typically last? Is there something else going on?</p>
","<p>There are different types of pads, even to fit the same model of brakes. </p>

<p>Sintered metal pads last longest, but are noisiest, often to the point of not being worth the better durability. </p>

<p>Resin pads are softer, and will last less mileage, particularly in wetter weather, but still should last far longer than 100 miles. </p>

<p>I would say that the rotors are damaged from being ridden metal on metal before, and need to be replaced, along with new brake pads. </p>

<p>Your mileage will vary based on weather, braking habits, pad type, riding style and terrain. But you should normally get 500-700miles from a resin pad, and 1000-1250 miles from a sintered metal pad. </p>

"do I need to change my disc if the brake pads got oil on them","32024","","<p>In trying to change the brake pads on my mountain bike, I managed to get oil on my new pads and empty out all the brake fluid, and consequently also get some oil on the disc. I took the bike to the shop and they are now telling me I need to change the pads and the disc. I can understand the pads, but do I really need to change the disc or is the guy (girl actually) just scamming me. The disc is not soaking in oil, from what I can tell it just has a bit of oil here and there. </p>
","<p>First of all you need to tell the LBS (local bike shop) that the disk can be ""fixed"". Then you need to find another LBS because they are either amateurs or are simply trying to make you buy stuff that you don't need.</p>

<p>You need to remove the oily disk from the bike and use a bike degreaser or alcohol on it to remove all oil. Rub with a clean dry cloth or kitchen paper and repeat. While finishing the process avoid touching the disk with bare hands on the face where the pads contact it because fingers leave grease as well.</p>

<p>Regarding your pads, these can be ""fixed"" as well in case they are sintered. You'll clean them using a degreaser or alcohol and slightly grind them (let's say remove ~0.2 mm of surface) with a thin sand paper. This will make sure that the pads are like new. Then you'll do whatever you do when using new pads (bed them in).</p>

<p>If the pads are not sintered but are organic then the above process may not do the work because organic pads can suck some oil inside (like sponges but not that much). I've heard of people boiling the pads in a frying pan with tap water and a bit of dishwasher soap but I don't know whether this will work. If you do that make sure you don't inhale any of the steam and also use an old pan which you'll never ever going to use again for cooking.</p>

"What do I grease and what do I lubricate?","31882","","<p>I always thought grease was a means of lubricating, but based on the reading I've been doing here it seems they are different things.

<p>I'm all about buying a big container of something that I know I'm going to use a lot of. I also hate overspending on ""high quality"" if the cheap stuff works well enough (for a cheap bike). </p>

<p>What recommendations do you have for buying grease,  lubricant, and degreaser in bulk? What's the shelf-life like? Is there a single grease/lubricant/degreaser that will work on all the parts of my bike that need grease/lubricant/degreasing? Or will I have to buy more than one of each type? How terrible would it be if I didn't?</p>
","<p>Chain lube goes on the chain. It's liquid and it drips on. We used to use ""oil"" for this but now there are lubes that a better engineered to provide lubrication without collecting dirt, washing off in the rain, breaking down chemically, etc. You also use this kind of liquid lube on brake pivots, derailleur pulleys and pivots. Probably not the same stuff you use on a chain although some products can serve both purposes. There's really not much more most cyclists need to do other than keep things clean. </p>

<p>The average consumer of bikes does not need grease. Grease goes on unsealed (loose ball) bearings - wheels, headsets, bottom brackets typically. However a lot of these bearings are are sealed now so you can't service them you just replace them. </p>

<p>Anti-seize compound is last. Like grease most consumers won't use this. Also, grease is often used in place of anti seize. This stuff goes on threads. Headsets, bottom brackets, pedals, and basically any little screw or bolt. It can also go on the seat post but you can also use grease for that. </p>

"Heavier Thicker Chains and Gears for Winter due to Salt?","31795","","<p>I have two bikes: one having gear-things outside and one with inner-hub. The gear-outside-bike has suffered a lot due to the salt during this winter, the other hilariously looks like a new one. I noticed that some XC bikes have very thick chains and the metal used in chain is different, a owner told me that he changed to a thicker chain during winter. I am planning to do similar upgrade to my salted chains that salt has destroyed during the winter and perhaps to gears as well -- actually I must change everything at once because leaving destroyed gear-round-things would destroy new chain pretty quickly (heard this from an engineer). So:</p>

<ol>
<li>What should I look in chains and the gears for winter?</li>
<li>When switching to larger gear-round-things and thicker chains, are there some special restrictions?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have currently (3x9, 3 front and 9 back) gears.</p>
","<p>Bike chains come in two sizes, 1/8inch (aka BMX chain) and 3/32inch (aka 9 speed chain). 1/8inch chains are designed for single speed or internal hub geared bicycles and the chain is designed in such a way that it can not be derailed from the sprocket. A 3/32inch chain is designed for a derailleur geared bicycle and is designed to ease shifting from one sprocket to another.</p>

<p>The thickness of the chain will have little if anything to do with how the chain behaves or wears due to road salt. People have many different views on how to keep your chain happy and prevent it from wearing, my advice would be to either invest in a full chaincase (for a singlespeed bike) or to dry and lube your chain after it has gotten wet.</p>

<p>The trick to lubing a chain is to use a rag to remove any dirt. Then apply a small amount of a thick bicycle chain oil to the inside side of the chain (the top side of the chain at the bottom side of the bike, or the bottom side of the chain at the top side of the bike, if that makes sense). Finally, spin the chain good and proper to get the lube into the chain (it's useless if it's sitting on the outside of the chain, it needs to work its way inside the links) and then use the rag to remove any excess.</p>

<p>Excess chain oil sitting on the outside of the chain will attract dirt which will cause your chain to wear prematurely.</p>

<p>Edit: In summary, how can one determine what a safe speed is for a particular bike in a particular situation? </p>
","<p>I think it depends both on the rider (as @moz pointed out) and on the bike. And of course, you should have a clean road also.</p>

"Is there difference in quality for disc brake rotors?","31488","","<p>I am on the hunt for new rotors for my mechanical disc brakes, as the old are too twisted now and the brakes can't be adjusted without the disc rubbing the pads.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the cheapest possible rotors and several times more expensive ""series and branded"" ones?</p>
","<p>One of the most advanced designs is the ""floating rotor"", made of two different materials connected together. They look like this:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Is4FQ.jpg"" alt=""Hope floating rotor""></p>

<p>These are exceptional brake rotors. They are very rigid and won't bend sideways easily. Overheating is much less of a problem for these. If they are getting overheated, they don't bend that much because of the material expansion. Usually the spider in the middle is made of aluminium alloy, but you can get rotors with carbon core. Carbon ones weigh less, but cost a lot more than with alloy spider.</p>

<p>Also you can get a full carbon rotor:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCXGZ.jpg"" alt=""full carbon disk brake rotor""></p>

<p>These are very expensive. Marketing materials for these say they are perfect, but you can easily spend a lot of money only on one rotor. I have never tried a carbon rotor or even seen one in flesh, only on pictures. You can also get a combination of carbon with ceramic spider and other space-tech materials. <a href=""http://kettlecycles.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">kettlecycles.com</a> provide with examples of these. (Thanks @J-unior for the link)</p>

<p>One of the extremes I've seen is <a href=""http://www.bikerumor.com/2012/09/28/found-alligators-prototype-carbon-kevlar-ceramic-disc-brake-rotor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">combination of carbon and ceramic in a disk brake rotor</a>. Don't really think these are available in shops, but interesting to know.</p>

<p>If you go for single piece cheaper rotor, then you don't have such a big variation in materials: they are generally made of stainless steel. And here the shape is making a big difference.</p>

<p>If you get one of these: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7tLZ.jpg"" alt=""Hope Trials Disk Brake Rotor""></p>

<p>You'd be able to stop on a dime, but you don't get a lot of modulation. These things will be like an on/off switch if combined with good pads. These are Hope trials rotors and I would not recommend using them for anything other than trials. (If you are doing trials, you should already know this)</p>

<p>Then you have middle ground rotors with a lot of variations on patterns:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zxKm5.jpg"" alt=""Hayes Disk Brake Rotor""></p>

<p>These are the most common and most affordable with prices from £12 to £25. I do believe that in this category there is really not much difference in quality. But make sure that the pattern has overlapping holes: when the disk is dragged through the pads, there should not be a continuous line of solid material. Pads should have a way to clean themselves and if in a section of a rotor there is no gap, the pads will not self-clean, decreasing the overall performance. In this category choose the ones you like most.</p>

<p>And the last in the category are cheap and nasty rotors you get on bikes from Wal-Mart or Asda. They are usually heavy, easy to bend, with poor pattern. They look like this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gXDtN.jpg"" alt=""Cheap disk brake rotor""></p>

<p>Apart from the material and type of construction don't forget that you have different diameters of the rotors: 145mm, 160mm, 180mm, 203mm and 205mm. The bigger the rotor, the more braking power you get and better heat distribution, but also the greater the weight. Usually downhillers go for 205mm rotors on the front and 180 on the rear. For more calm disciplines like XC 160mm rotors are more common.</p>

<p>The size of the rotor must match your current one, but you can buy an adapter to place you disk brake caliper in the right position for the size of the rotor. </p>

<p>And you can get different types of mounts to the hub. The most popular is 6 hole international standard - on all of the rotors above. But you also get Shimano Centre Lock:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q1pJu.jpg"" alt=""Shimano Centre Lock mount""></p>

<p>For this type of mount you need to have a hub with the same mount or use adapters from 6-bolt to Centre lock. 8-10 years ago there used to be rotors with 5 and 4 holes for mounting, but you can't get them now.</p>

"How do I choose a bicycle fork?","31358","","<p>I'm putting together a bicycle <em>on a budget</em> from a frame I was given and various parts from a bike with a broken frame. The only part of any expense that I really need is the fork, and I want to get this via an auction (likely Yahoo auction Japan). </p>

<p>The frame itself is a women's Scott Tacana. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O5JVq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'm not necessarily looking for shocks, I really just want something cheap that fits. Are there different diameters, tube lengths etc, that I need to be aware of?</p>
","<p>There are only a few measurements you need to be aware of when purchasing a new fork, particularly if you're avoiding suspension.  If you don't need suspension, don't get it - it will only add cost and complexity, and a cheap suspension fork will be much worse than a rigid fork.</p>

<p>The basic measurements you need to be aware of are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Headset type.</strong>  Not truly a measurement, but there are two types of headsets - threaded and threadless.  The photo you show is of a bike with a threadless headset; the fork's steerer tube will be a smooth, unthreaded tube and the headset is tensioned with a bolt from the top and the clamping action of the stem.</li>
<li><strong>Steerer tube diameter.</strong> Also two main options, 1"" (25.4mm) and 1 1/8"" (28.6mm, also known as 1.125"" or 9/8"").  Nearly all threadless headsets use 1 1/8"" steerers. You can verify that the frame you have is for that size by measuring the inside of the head tube, it should be 34mm.  If you already have a headset installed, you can verify that the inner diameter of that is 28.6mm.</li>
<li><strong>Steerer tube length.</strong> If you are purchasing a new (or ""uncut"") fork this is extremely unlikely to be an issue, but on a used fork you'll need to check. The steerer tube needs to be long enough to extend above the top of the headset with room for the stem to clamp fully.  Too short and it can't be used with that frame.  Too long isn't an issue, since you can easily use spacers and/or cut it to length.  If you measure your stem clamp, your headset, and the length of your head tube and add a few mm for a safe margin you've got a bare minimum steerer length you'll need.</li>
<li><strong>Wheel size and brake type.</strong> The bike in the picture has 26"" (559) wheels and is designed for cantilever or v-brakes. The position of those brake mounts is specific to the wheel diameter, so you'll want to make sure it's for the right size wheels.  If you switch to disc brakes, you can omit this concern, but not entirely, because of...</li>
<li><strong>Axle-to-crown length.</strong> This is the distance from the center of the axle to the top of the fork crown, just below where the steerer tube starts. The frame's geometry was designed around a certain distance here, and changing it dramatically will alter the handling by increasing or decreasing the angles relative to the ground.  For mountain bike forks this information is more difficult to come by than for road bike forks, but if your bicycle originally had a suspension fork the rule of thumb for rigid is to find a fork that is ""suspension corrected"" for the amount of travel your bike originally sold with.  In the case of the Scott Tocana it looks like most models shipped with an 80mm suspension fork, so an 80mm suspension-corrected rigid fork should keep things normal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, given the bike you've shown, if you look for an '26-inch fork, 80mm suspension corrected, 1 1/8"" uncut steerer, v-brake posts' you will probably find something suitable.</p>

In that video (around 3:08) I assumed that they were pedaling backwards just for ""style"" or whatever to make it look cooler - and after reading I think it is a cassette hub he is running.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of a cassette/freecoaster hub, and am I right to assume that if you take your feet off of either to do a trick that they will not keep spinning (provided that you press off of the pedals evenly and don't produce a spin)?</p>
","<p>My son wanted to change his freewheel/cassete hub to a freecoaster hub so I did some research about 6 months ago and found this great YouTube <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12I8iK12oqA"">video</a> from Odyssey and RideBMX magazine all about freecoaster hubs.</p>

<p>As you said, the cranks will not move when coasting backwards. For my son, this is the real advantage and why he wanted the hubs. Landing a 180 out of a half pipe, his freewheel hub did not allow great control of the bicycle requiring him to spin cranks as he rolled backward (just like that trick at 3:08 in your video).</p>

<p>In the end it came down to money and we (he 12 year old) did not want to spend the money to get a new wheel with a freecoaster hub, you cannot just swap the axle/mechanism/insides of your freewheel shell with a freecoaster mechanism, you need a shell/hub that supports the freecoaster axle/mechanism.</p>

"Looking for Techniques for Riding Uphill on a Single Speed","30244","","<p>I commute on a Single Speed (SS) bike about 13mi round trip. Going home is not a problem as the gradients are low and I can climb them. However, going in to work the gradients are much steeper and I have a hard time climbing them. I usually need to stop and walk a bit. I am looking for any pointers on climbing hills on an SS. Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I am not really looking for ways to avoid hurting myself, I am young and fit so that isn't my biggest concern. I am more concerned with making my pedaling technique more efficient, especially for hill climbs. Another point I should mention is that I am using clipless pedals to increase my power output.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I added this because I can only choose one best answer. I think that @GuyZee best addressed my question about technique, but @Steven offered a great deal of help with regards to getting a better mechanical advantage. Thanks to both of you for providing great answers.</p>
","<p>I ride both SS/FG and approach climbing hills much of the same way I would if I were on a geared bike with one very big exception...MOMENTUM. When on a heavily geared SS/FG I gain as much speed as possible going into the hill and push hard to maintain it throughout the climb.</p>

<p>Basic climbing tips: </p>

<ol>
<li>Slide back on saddle and drive heels through the bottom of the pedal stroke</li>
<li>If you need to stand, do so while minimizing body sway and unnecessary counterproductive upper body motion</li>
<li>Get into a rhythm - climb at your own pace</li>
<li>Stay upright to keep lungs operating at full capacity</li>
<li>Pull handlebars into your thighs as you drive pedals forward</li>

"When to change derailleur pulleys?","29925","","<p>A friend said me that if you have one part in a very bad condition like a cassette and then you put a new stuff like a new chain it will destroy the new stuff very quickly. A LBS said that I should change my derailleur's pulley wheels after I said that the derailleur has undergone at least 10Mm. Then again, another LBS said that I should change only the cassette and the old derailleur pulleys do not matter. Hence, I am very confused. Are there any <em>objective</em> ways to state when one should change derailleur pulleys?</p>

<p>The diameters of the pulleys in the picture are about 3.6cm above and about 4.0cm below. They seem like the products <a href=""http://www.bike-components.de/products/language/en/info/p1370_Schaltraedchen-Paar-Deore-LX-9-fach.html"">here</a>. Cannot find the specs of the original ones to compare, yet.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfXk6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Worn derailleur pulleys (also known as ""jockey wheels"") will not cause excessive wear on a chain because they aren't made of metal.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, the bushings inside will become worn and the outer teeth will wear down.  Park illustrates the latter progression in their article on <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/rear-derailleur-overhaul"">rear derailleur overhaul</a>.</p>

<p>As with many things in bicycle maintenance the only objective metric for replacing something is that it no longer works satisfactorily.  Their failure mode might best be described as gradual rather than catastrophic.  If the pulley bushing doesn't have much slop in it and the teeth are still capable of guiding the chain effectively it's almost certainly fine. If the rest of the drivetrain is in new condition and there are still issues with shifting it's probably worth giving them a look.</p>

<p>As far as the practical matter of replacing them goes, in my experience for the most part you need to find the manufacturer specification to track down compatible replacements.</p>

"Is my chain too long?","29638","","<p>I'm in the process of setting up a new drive train.  When using the smaller chainring and smallest sprocket (hence least amount of utilized chain), the chain brushes up against the bottom of the derailleur. </p>

<p>Should I remove a link or two until this no longer happens?</p>
","<p>Edit: from your photos, yes, the chain is too long. In the large chainring-large cog photo it looks as though the derailleur arm could be pulled forward at least one chain link, possibly two.</p>

<p>My preferred method of finding chain length is to focus on the largest chainring-largest cog combination. If there's just barely enough chain for that everything will work, although the small-small combo may have a lot of slack. <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/chain-length-sizing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Park have an exhaustive explanation</a> of various methods.</p>

<p>Too much chain is kind of annoying, but too little can break things. Trying to shift into the large-large gear when there's not enough chain will stop your pedals, so there's a lot of force involved. Since you're going into a lower gear at that point, it often happens when you're pedalling hard. Hard enough to snap the chain in some cases. But also to snap the rear derailleur if it can't accomodate the position required, and if you're especially unlucky you might snap off the derailleur hanger as well. This breakage often throws the derailleur into your rear wheel which both breaks spokes and can dump you on the ground.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wuMVC.jpg"" alt=""bicycle rear derailleur with chain pulled into a Z shape to show excess"">What I suggest is shifting into the large-large combo and see if there is spare chain. Try pulling a link over itself so there's a wee Z formed in the chain. If you can do that there are extra links. Keep extending the Z until the rear derailleur seems unhappy, counting links. Now remove them. Remember you do need a little slack so you can get out of the gear - you're using the return spring in the rear derailleur to pull the chain off the biggest cog, and if there's too much chain tension it won't be able to do that. But as long as you can get into the gear you won't break anything (you just need to add a link back in, and maybe pull the wheel out to release the tension).</p>

<p>This ties into the ""some gears man was not meant to use"" discussion. In cross-over gears are the large-large and small-small ones, so called because the chain crosses over from one side of the crankset to the opposite side of the cassette. This causes extra friction and chain wear, and (almost always) those gears are duplicated elsewhere so there's no need to use them. So not being able to use the small-small combo because of slack chain should not normally be a problem.</p>

"How do I adjust my rear derailleur (Shimano SIS) when it is only slightly out?","29616","","<p>It has been a while since I had my bike serviced and the gears are sometimes slightly out of perfect alignment. This results in the occasional mis-shift.  I also think the change in seasons have played a part.<br>
What do I need to do to get it back to perfect?</p>
","<p>Adjusting the rear derailleur is a matter of tightening or slackening the shifter cable so that the chain runs smoothly for all rear cogs.  The easiest way to do this is using a barrel adjuster -- there's normally one where the cable runs into the derailleur and you may have another where the cable runs into the shifter or on the downtube for a road bike.</p>

<p>If you look at the barrel adjuster from the point of view of the cable <em>housing</em> (not the bare cable) running into it, turning the adjuster clockwise will slacken the cable and counter-clockwise will tighten it.  Adding slack to the rear derailleur should adjust the chain towards the small cog, tightening moves it towards the large cog.  If the barrel adjuster doesn't give you enough range, then you'll have to adjust the slack where the cable clamps into the derailleur.</p>

<p>With your bike in a stand, or flipped upside-down, change to your middle chainring (for a triple) and try it out.  You should be able to see small movements in the derailleur as you tweak the barrel adjuster.  I like to get the middle cog dialed in really well (change gears in/out this cog) and then check that this setup works for all of the others.  You'll probably have to adjust this slightly once you ride the bike.  <em>(Once you get comfortable with this, you can actually tweak the derailleur mid-ride without stopping if you have a barrel adjuster on the shifter or down tube)</em></p>

<p>After tweaking the derailleur setup, you should also double-check the limit screws just to be on the safe side.  These are two screws on the derailleur that adjust how far it can move.  One keeps the chain from going past the large cog (sometimes marked L?) and the other does the same for the small cog (H?).  Make sure that the derailleur cannot move the chain off of the end cogs.  Turning the appropriate screw clockwise should push the limit in towards the center of the cassette, counter-clockwise normally gives the derailleur more freedom.</p>

<p>Of course, there are a whole range of other problems that can affect shifting (worn chain, worn cogs, bad chain line, worn cable/housing, sticky derailleur, etc.), but try this first.</p>

","<p>They will make a significant difference, but the size of the tire alone won't make much of a difference to your speed. If your current tires have a substantial amount of tread on them, you may notice a speed difference since smaller tires tend to have less tread on average.  It's probably not going to be a substantial difference though, even if you have the knobbiest 38's on the market. Your biggest speed limitation is wind resistance, and while the narrower profile of the tires will knock that down a little, it's a small portion of the overall wind resistance that you experience. </p>

<p>Where you'll notice the biggest difference will be in how much harsher the ride will feel with skinnier tires. They run at higher pressures so you end up feeling every bump in the road more.</p>

<p>You'll also notice that the steering feels more nimble due to the lighter weight of the skinnier tires.</p>

<p>You'll also be more prone to pinch flats with skinnier tires. To what extent will depend on the tire pressure that you've been running and the tire pressure you're going to run.</p>

"Are road tyres suitable for any off-road riding at all?","29258","","<p>I'm looking to buy a bike for my commute - 6 miles a day. The commute itself is all on roads, so naturally I'm looking at road bikes. My main worry is that if I invest in such a bike I won't be able to ride off-road at all, for example down a towpath (Towpaths can have very rough surfaces). </p>

<p>Would I be better off investing in a light hybrid bike (with thicker tyres) over the road bike, given that I might want to go off-road some of the time?</p>
","<p>If you're looking for a general purpose bike for commuting and towpath riding, you probably want to avoid a standard road bike, they are very specialized and have very small tire clearance.  Typically supporting tires no larger than 28mm and often lack mud guards or rack/pannier mounts.</p>

<p>However, touring bikes or steel cyclocross bikes (if they have rack and fender mounts), tend to be great choices for those purposes.  Both will often have clearance for tires up to 35mm or larger which you can use for off road riding and have a more traditional road geometry versus the more upright hybrid geometry.  However, if you prefer the more upright stance and flat bars, then a hybrid may be more well suited to you.  </p>

<p>I would make sure that whatever bike you get does have rack/fender mounts if it's going to be used as a commuter.  You never know if you'll want to start using a rack and panniers to carry your gear off your back or fenders to keep you drier in the rain.</p>

<p>You can get knobby tires for any of these bikes, but I would stick with high quality, puncture resistant road tires wider than 28mm.  Even slick tires that are 35mm should be fine for towpath riding, I wouldn't take them on singletrack though.</p>

"Bike is shifting on its own","29126","","<p>Ever since I got my bike (Surly Long Haul Trucker), it has been prone to shifting on its own.  This is almost guaranteed to happen when I stand up on the pedals, and happens regularly when sitting as well.  I have the feeling that this is a dangerous condition.</p>

<p>It seems from reading about the problem that it is due to the cable catching somewhere and creating a clutch effect.  (<a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/autoshift.html"">read about it here</a>)
There does not seem to be a way to adjust the friction of the shift lever.
I've tried:</p>

<li>backing off the tension of the cable with the tension knob on the cable casing (no effect)</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone relate how they overcame this?  My next step is to further loosen the cable by adjusting the connection to the derailleur?   </p>
","<p>Neil is right, most all ""auto shifting"" or ""ghost shifting"" is the result of cable-tension problems.
If the cable is a bit loose, the derailleur will try to shift ""up"" to a smaller cog.  If too tight, it will try to catch the next larger cog.
Cables stretch, especially after a short period where the new cables stretch to the point they're stable.  after that, they should be good for a long time.
Try this.<br>
Shift to the highest (smallest) cog and try to pull the DR cable away from the frame.  If there's a lot of slack, it's too loose.  If it feels very tight....
With either condition, make sure the shifter is in the highest position, and loosen the cable at the DR and then pull it snug.  Re-tighten the securing bolt and run it through the gears; it should be very close.
Ideally, the chain should jump smartly to each cog both up and down, and seat solidly on the cog.
If it's just a bit off, you can play with the barrel adjuster either at the shifter or at the DR.
Another cause of such problems is a bent rear DR ""hanger"", the part that the DR attaches to.
Some of these are very soft aluminum and can be easily bent.<br>
Make sure the DR cage is exactly parallel to the cogs and the hanger is not visibly bent.</p>

"How can you recognise a quality steel frame?","28912","","<p>I'm looking to buy/build a road bike and I would like it to:</p>

<ul>
<li>last 100 years</li>
<li>have a low environmental cost</li>
</ul>

<p>As I'm not interested in shedding grams (a diet would be more helpful for me), I'm leaning towards a steel frame. But steel frames are often cheaply manufactured, and the price is slowly starting to reflect trendiness than quality.</p>

<p>How do I recognise a high quality new or used steel frame? Are there simple things to look for when weeding out the poorly made or overpriced frames?</p>
","<p>Some things differ if you are looking at a new or a used frame, but here are some suggestions:</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, when you say you are looking for a steel frame, what you probably mean is a ChroMoly Steel alloy frame.  This would be a frame made from tubes where chromium and molybdenum  were added as the steel was refined.  Frequently you will see a sticker on the tube with a number like 531, 631, 725 or 853 which is used to describe the particular blend.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, spotting a high or low quality frame has become more difficult over the years as machining and welding techniques have filtered down. With older frames you definitely want to look at the quality of the welds and brazing, as well as the paint.  Welds may be smooth, or have a regular pattern.  Watch out for welds that look rough, 'globby' or irregular.  It used to be that the use of lugs was a hallmark of lower quality frames, but today you see them more often on high end boutique or custom touring frames.</p>

<p>You may also want to feel the bottom sides of the tubes for a ""seam"".  On older low quality frames you frequently find rolled tubes, where the steel was a flat sheet that was then rolled and welded length-wise.</p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, the durability of a steel frame is largely a function of the paint quality and maintenance. Water and rust are the primary enemies of a steel frame.  If buying used you will want to closely inspect the area around the bottom bracket, dropouts, and the whole underside of the bike for chips, cracks and visible rust.  For long life, as well as the low environmental cost, steel v. aluminum is probably a wash.  In the US and most the developed countries both aluminum and steel recycling is around 50% and the production costs and impacts are pretty similar.  And while corrosion may be an issue, an aluminum frame won't rust.</p>

<p>Good Luck.</p>

","<p>Your crank arm is trashed. </p>

<p>With the crank bolt removed, <strong><em>gently</em></strong> ride around a few miles, it should work itself loose enough that you can yank it off.</p>

<p>Otherwise many shops have basically a slightly larger crank puller for addressing this issue, where they chase out a larger set of threads, then use the larger puller to get it off. The crank arm typically goes into the garbage at that point however.</p>

"Is there an optimal postion for SPD cleats?","28607","","<p>I bought some SPD clipless pedals and shoes at the beginning of the season, and I want to make sure I'm getting the most out of them.  There is quite a bit of distance I can move the cleat forwards and backwards on the shoe. </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there an optimal position for the cleat?</li>
<li>Are there certain positions better suited towards hill climbing or riding mostly on flat land?</li>
<li>Should I just try a bunch of different positions and see which is most comfortable for me?</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of questions I guess, just looking for general recommendations on placement.  The cleat is currently in the middle, and I don't have any real ""problems"" with them, like pain or fatigue, I'm just wondering if my setup is optimal. </p>
","<p>You pedal with the ball of your foot and this should placed directly above the pedal axle. However, because you move your foot in a ~170mm radius circle altering the angle of your foot, 'directly above' moves back and fore through the pedal stroke. Getting the ball of the foot behind the axle is not desirable as you are then using the toes rather than the ball (or arch) of the foot to pedal with. Therefore, in practice, you need to have the ball of your foot approximately 10mm forward of the axle.</p>

<p>Placing the ball of the foot 10mm forward of the axle helps during the bottom of the power stroke. You can push the pedal backwards through the dead spot. It also helps at the top of the stroke. IMHO if the toes are having to do all the work (and the cleats are too far forward) then you can tell on a climb - the toes want to give up on you, almost dangerously so...</p>

<p>Alignment is also important. Ideally you want the cleats to be pointing forward with the left/right bolts in the same positions in their little slots on each shoe. This can feel 'pigeon toed' when you get on the bike and it does no harm to angle in the heels so long as there is clearance between them and the cranks. We all have variations in gait and this needs to be accommodated with a little bit of adjustment.</p>

<p>On the subject of natural variations, we all have one foot larger than the other, sometimes this can be some margin, in many cases this can be a whole E.U. shoe size. In practical terms, if placing the cleat so that the ball of the foot to be 10mm forward of the axle, there should be no need to adjust relative cleat positions.</p>

<p>As for determining exactly where the ball of the foot is, with an already worn shoe you can take the insole out and line it up with the sole. Otherwise you have to take an educated 'feel' from looking at your feet on the pedals.</p>

"Can cyclists legally ride on the sidewalk?","28424","","<p>Can cyclists ride on the sidewalk? What if the road in question has no bike lane? If cyclists can ride on the sidewalk, does it matter which side of the road the sidewalk is on? I live in California - would the law vary by state or locality?</p>

<p>Are there other concerns outside of the legality to consider?</p>
","<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>In general, <strong>riding on the sidewalk is more dangerous than riding on the road.</strong> There's higher risk from cars coming out of driveways than cars overtaking you from behind. Generally cars aren't looking for anything on a sidewalk moving more than about 3-4 mph, there's often visual obstacles (trees, sign posts, etc) so you're likely to be invisible to cars that might turn into you. Going against the direction of traffic gives everybody a bit less time to react to anything going wrong and puts you on the side car drivers typically aren't looking in.</p>

<p>If it's legal on a specific block, I might ride slowly (5mph, 8mph tops) for a block on the sidewalk to get to a spot where I can get onto the road properly. But be extra-aware of all driveways and side streets. I might also ride on the sidewalk for under 10 feet when coming off of the road via a driveway or curb cut in order to stop and lock up my bike.</p>

<h2>Check your local laws</h2>

<p>There is no statewide California law prohibiting operating a bicycle on a sidewalk, however <a href=""http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc21206.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">California Vehicle Code Section 21206</a> allows local (county, city, etc) governments to regulate operation of bicycles on pedestrian facilities.</p>

<p>In other words, there is no California-wide answer to the legality. It may be illegal in the specific area you were riding, but legal on the next block over or legal on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>In the city I live in (in California), it's illegal in two defined ""downtown"" areas, but otherwise legal. In some cities it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk anywhere in the city.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it's simpler to explain that California Vehicle Code Section 21650(g) explicitly allows riding on sidewalks and through crosswalks, unless prohibited by local ordinance.</p>

"Unsure of Proper Tire Pressure","28285","","<p>I purchased a new bicycle and I'm confused about the tire pressure.  The guy at the bicycle shop told me to inflate to at least 100psi.</p>

<p>However the bicycle itself has the words '<strong>Maximum inflation - 65 PSI</strong>'</p>

<p>The bicycle is a Giant Escape.  I can't remember if they called it a commuter bicycle or a road cruiser (it doesn't have the drop style handlebars).  The tire itself is a '<strong>Giant S-X3, 700x32</strong>' and it says '<strong>32-622</strong>' </p>

<p>I rode the bicycle at 65 psi and, while I'm new, it felt kind of low to me.  I wasn't hitting the rim or anything extreme like that; I just prefer a stiffer ride - but I'm afraid to go past what the tire has printed on it.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what I should be inflating my tire to?  I'm ~175 pounds if that matters, most of the sites I've found on the topic give recommendations based on weight.  Still, I'm worried about damaging the tire or rim.</p>

<p>I will be doing 100% street riding.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>2 major things to consider when deciding what PSI to run your tires are the rims and the tire itself. Most tires can handle higher tire pressure than what is printed on them but are ""guaranteed"" to handle the PSI printed on the sidewall. If you are buying quality tires, you have a better chance of pumping them higher with out blowing them out. Coming back to the rims, just because the tire can handle the PSI doesn't mean the rim can. I am going to assume you have aluminum rims, and unless they are POS, they should be able to handle higher pressure. I found that the tire's printed PSI is sometimes higher than the rim's capabilities when I used to ride nylon mag wheels back in the old days. I bought a 100psi rated tire and it kept blowing off the rim. That was when I decided to switch to spoked rims.</p>

<p>There is a good chance you will be able to ride at higher PSI, just be aware that there is no guarantee past the printed PSI.</p>

"Is front suspension remote lockout worth it?","28253","","<p>My old city bike is getting worn out and I'm considering getting a new and better bike. I will use it for my daily commute (paved road - very uneven in places) and the occasional trip outside the city on unpaved roads.

<ul>
<li>Large wheels (29'er/cross-road)</li>
<li>Good brakes (hydraulic disc brakes)</li>
<li>Front suspension with lockout</li>
<li>Remote lockout of the suspension</li>

<p>I've never had a bicycle with front suspension before but to me it seems like a no brainer to get remote lockout. I expect to have the suspension locked on my daily commute, but I know several places on my route where I would think having an unlocked suspension would be nice.</p>

<p>What are my best alternative?</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep looking for a bike that satisfy my needs including having a remote lockout? Being unsuccesful doing this made me come here for advice.</li>
<li>Look for a bike that satisfy my needs with the possibility of having a remote lockout mounted aftermarket? I don't know if this is possible without a significant cost increase which detracts from this solution.</li>
<li>Forget about the remote lockout and just keep it locked for my daily commute just as I do today where I have no suspension at all?</li>

","<p>First off many forks have a remote lock out as an add on. Fox and rock shox especially. If it has a lock out, a remote lock out is likely available. </p>

"How can I tell if a rim is bent or if the wheel is just out of true?","28202","","<p>How can I tell if a rim is bent or if the wheel is just out of true?</p>
","<p>The common qualification here is an important one: truing is a skill that benefits from practice and experience (chicken, meet egg). Your wheels are important, and it's important to have somebody who knows what they're doing at least check your work if you're just learning (or if you're disinclined to trust your well-being in dense traffic to wheels you trued yourself).</p>

<p>Having said that, a rim that isn't bent should have more or less even spoke tension across all the spokes when it is true. On the other hand, a bent rim will require higher tension in some spots and lower tension in others. So, noticeably uneven spoke tension in a true wheel is one sign that the rim might be bent.</p>

<p>I ordered a 116 link chain.  Will I need to shorten it?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>If your old chain was 114 links (assuming it was the right size to begin with) then it's a good idea to take a couple of links out of it. It'll still work with two extra links but shifting may not be optimal and the chain will fall off more easily. Keep in mind that one chain link is composed of an inner and outer link, so a link is actually two pieces with a hinge in the center. This means that to remove two links, you'll actually remove four pieces of chain with three hinge points. </p>

<p>If the old chain was 116 links and you're trying to replace it with a 114 link chain, you'll run into problems. A chain that is too short can jam when shifting and puts puts too much strain on your rear derailleur. </p>

<p>To determine the correct length, wrap your chain around largest chain ring in the front and the largest rear sprocket, without running it through the derailleurs. Make sure that the chain is long enough for one full link (again, inner and outer) to overlap and you'll probably be spot on. </p>

<p>I used to think that was unavoidable, but then I noticed that on some bikes the chain and cogs are shiny clean. Is that because their owners clean the chain daily (because honestly one day is enough for a chain to turn black after full cleaning) or because they use different lubrication solutions?</p>

"How do I clean chain grease off my clothes?","27647","","<p>I commute to work, and often wear my khakis on the ride in. As such, my clothes often get chain grease on them. What products or cleaning strategies do you know that work to remove chain grease from clothes?</p>
","<p>There is a lot of sense to @Neil Fein's 'get used to it' attitude as, with some garments, you are just not going to get the oil out. 'Prevention is better than cure' definitely applies, but we are past that, aren't we...</p>

<p>In the office environment you have tea making facilities, including a sink with some washing up liquid and maybe some disposable hand-towels. Put the washing up liquid on the affected area neat, without water. Make yourself a brew whilst it soaks into the fabric. Now dab out what you can with a damp cloth and get it dry with the hand towels. This will remove the stuff that has not ingrained in yet and stop it spreading, e.g. to cross-contaminate your other leg.</p>

<p>When it comes to the wash you can apply an 'oxy' stain remover spray to the affected area before popping it into the machine. The active ingredient in 'oxy' is tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) and this enables bleaches in normal washing powders to work at 40 degrees (so no boil wash needed). Now add biological washing powder to the machine and put it on the 40 degrees wash cycle. The 'biological' enzymes for removing grease in such powders only work effectively at 40 degrees, so, with TAED and the enzymes working away on your stain (that has already had the excess removed) you can effectively get your clothes clean with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Swarfega hand cleaner is something you may also want to look into getting - this stuff is brilliant for cleaning hands and clothing alike. Again you put the stuff on raw without water, then wash it off once done.</p>

<p>'Prevention is better than cure', so make sure your chain is clean and lightly oiled. A heavily oiled chain collects dirt and it is this dirt that does the damage. You can also investigate getting a wax lubed chain as that copes with dirt better. If you run hub gears or single speed you may also want to consider using one of those 'rustless' chains that has a special coating and does not need oil.</p>

<p>Hope that helps! </p>

I've never shopped for this part before. How do I know what size to buy? Are there different types? My tube size is 26 inches. </p>
","<p>There are a couple of types of rim tape available:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cloth</strong> - This has a glue backing and is very long lasting.  If you need to replace a spoke nipple, depending on the age of the tape, you will most probably have to also replace the tape since it will no longer stick to the rim.  </li>
<li><strong>Rubber</strong> - This is continuous loop of rubber (stretchy) and the stretch is what holds the tape in place.  As it ages there is a tendency for the area around the valve stem hole to break.  The rubber can also perish or become brittle with age.  </li>
<li><strong>Plastic</strong> - This is a slightly stretchy plastic in a continuous loop that can be slipped over the outer rim.  I found that the tapes have issues as they age with cracking, particularly when you are using high pressure tyres.  You can get little splits in the tape just above the holes of the rim. </li>
</ul>

<p>My personal favourite is the cloth tape, over time they have been the most dependable.</p>

<p>It is very important to get the right width of rim tape.  If the tape is too narrow you can get the tube being pinched into the rim hole, or cut by the hole.  If the tape is too wide then you can get the tyre being lifted of the rim when at high pressure (not instantaneous and leads to a huge bang).</p>

"What is the difference between different types of disc brake pads","27219","","<p>I've seen several different descriptors for disc brake pads: Metallic, Semi-Metallic, and Organic.  What is the difference between these types of disc brake pads?</p>
","<p>Youll run into two types of metallic pads- sintered metallic and semi-metallic. The term ""metallic"" without any modifier gets used for a couple of reasons- a) many manufacturers don't offer both varieties of metallic pads for a given brake, so the type is implicit, and b) lots of folks don't know the difference or think the terms are interchangeable. They are similar, but different:</p>

<p>Sintered metallic pads offer the best stopping power, but also cause the most rotor wear and can make the most noise, especially when wet. They are also the least affected by adverse conditions. Sintered metallic are typically used in downhill/freeride applications, but can be used for less demanding riding types as well. Depending on the setup, sintered pads can feel ""grabby"", that is, that they lack modulation at the lever. That problem tends to arise on more powerful brakes with larger rotors though, and both of those factors play towards that perception.</p>

<p>Semi-metallics are a tradeoff between braking performance and pad wear/noise. They still stop very well but can be a little less noisy and cause a little less rotor wear. They may also offer better lever modulation than sintered metallic pads. This pad type can often be found on higher end all-mountain, trail, and cross country oriented brakes, though some manufacturers opt for sintered pads while others may opt for organics.</p>

<p>Organic pads are the kindest to your rotors and typically quitest, but don't offer the same bite as metallic pads. These pads also wear the quickest. This does not mean that they're low end pads though, and depending on conditions, riding style and personal preference they may be a great choice. Organic pads can offer the best lever modulation of the three pad types, but may not stop riders sufficiently in demanding circumstances.</p>

"Can I fit a cassette with a larger range with my Shimano Tiagra 10-speed ( GS-4600) derailleur?","27099","","<p>I'm currently running a 2x10 shimano tiagra 10-speed drivetrain with a 50/34 compact crankset, a 12-30 rear cassette, and a Shimano Tiagra GS-4600 derailleur (that's medium cage aka road long cage) on a light touring / road bike.  </p>

<p>I tend to ride a lot of hills and want a touch more range for tough climbs.  Can I make this work with an 11-32 or 11-34 mountain cassette or do I need to get a long cage derailleur? </p>

<p>It looks like I might answer my own questions, becuase the <a href=""http://techdocs.shimano.com/media/techdocs/content/cycle/EV/bikecomponents/RD/EV-RD-4600-3151C_v1_m56577569830775436.pdf"">specs</a> say, they say I shouldn't really run more than a 30t max in the rear. However, I'm wondering if anyone else has tried this and had success going past spec with this derailleur or if I should resign myself to spending more cash on a new derailleur.</p>
","<p>With the b-screw tightened all the way on the medium cage GS-4600 tiagra derailleur I was able to install the 11-32 cassette. It was obvious from the appearance that I wouldn't be able to squeeze any larger of a cassette on the rear wheel without switching to a long cage mountain or touring derailleur.</p>

<p>There were no issues when shifting with the 34t front chainring in or out of the 32t rear cog.   </p>

<p>However, using the 50t front chainring, shifting out of the large 32t cog was a little off. It worked, but it was lagging a bit and having a harder time jumping to the next cog, probably due to the chain being too short since I didn't adjust the chain length.</p>

<p>This should be solved by adding a link or two to the chain. However, I'm going to be swapping in a 46t large chainring, so that should address the lack of slack. I shouldn't even be in the big ring in the back and the big ring in the front anyway to avoid cross chaining.</p>

"Don't integrated headsets wear out, ruining the frame?","26943","","<p>I came upon this marvelous explanation of headset types.</p>

<p>However, this got me wondering. Isn't the role of the headset cups similar to that of the derauler hanged - to not waste the frame as soon as some wear-outable components ends it's life? How do frames with integrated headsets survive more than several years?</p>

","<p>Here's an excerpt from Chris King about headset types:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is an “Integrated” headset?</strong></p>
  
  <p>It is a bicycle frame, fork and bearing system designed to eliminate the humble headset cup. To integrate
  means to combine and hopefully to simplify. What has been “integrated” by the integrated headset? The bearings
  now rest inside the frame instead of inside pressed-in cups. All of this trouble and confusion is to remove two 12
  gram headset cups from the front of your bicycle. True, an integrated headset can give the bike a nice, smooth
  looking front end, but the consequences of this change to your bicycle are significant. </p>
  
  <p>Simply put, the performance
  and lifetime that you expect from your new bicycle will be reduced, most severely in aluminum mountain bikes. All
  bicycle frames that use integrated headsets will ultimately have substantial performance and reliability problems
  due to the inherent flaws in this design. The largest flaw is a bearing system that does not positively attach the
  bearing to the frame, leaving the bearing to “float” resulting in wear and impact damage to the frame. </p>
  
  <p>As an
  additional complication, each manufacturer seems to be doing their own thing, with no real standardization to date.
  As a result, there are multiple bearing types and sizes (some of which have been discontinued with no replacement
  options) and the frame builders and bearing makers are not all working from the same drawings. Lack of
  standardization is a bad thing for everyone. It means that you may not be able to get replacement headset bearings
  for your bike, and you
  will
  need them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to answer your question, yes, an integrated headset will eventually wear out, but that service time is dependent on riding type, style, number of hours, and quality/material of the frame.</p>

"Why do my disc brakes squeal when wet?","26827","","<p>Picture the scene... It's just been raining and you are getting ready to commute home after work, you cycle out on to the tarmac, the scent of fresh rain on hot tarmac fills your nostrils, you notice a pedestrian push the button on the traffic lights up ahead, the lights turn red and you gently squeeze your brake to stop before the line but at the same time your brakes let out a horrific squeal frightening the pedestrians and ruining your street cred.</p>

<p><strong>What's the deal? why do my disc brakes squeal when its wet, and is it possible to prevent this? Is it more common for disc brakes to squeal and why?</strong></p>

<p>I am currently riding a Scott Aspect 30.</p>
","<p>They squeal because water acts as a mild lubricant. That's why things are ""slippery when wet"" ;)<br><br>
The water makes it harder for the pads to grab onto the rotors. They'll grab for a small fraction of a second and then let go again, and they do this really fast. Imagine the squeaky sound that a your finger makes when your run it over a smooth wet surface, or the sound your shoes make on a tile floor when you just came in out of the rain. Same sort of thing, only constant.
With bike brakes and disc brakes especially, the braking surface (the rotors for disc brakes, the rim for rim brakes) will find a harmonic resonance and thus the really loud tonal squeal.<br><br>
All brakes have the potential to squeal, especially when wet. I wouldn't worry much about it unless you find that your braking power is being significantly reduced. In such a case, try some different compound pads. Metallic pads are generally considered to be superior in adverse conditions but they're also loud as hell in the rain/mud. <br><br>
Everything is a trade-off, don't ya know? </p>

"Riding a Mountain Bike in the city","26695","","<p>I just moved from where there wasn't much of a biking system infrastructure.  There were lots of trails though, so I bought an OK mountain bike ($350).</p>

<p>Now, I've moved to downtown Seattle and everyone bikes.  I'd love to get into it but not sure if a mountain bike is efficient for road-use.</p>

<p>Should I look into a conversion kit?  Should I just get a road bike and have one off-road and one on-road?</p>
","<p>I would at least put road tires on your mountain bike - they really improve your efficiency on pavement.</p>

<p>If your commute is urban w/ lots of stops &amp; traffic navigation, the mountain bike handlebar setup can be more maneuverable for tight situations than a road/touring bike. I do miss the maneuverability of my mountain bike since switching to a road bike.

"Will my bike hold my weight?","26425","","<p>I'm pretty heavy (~150kg/330lbs) but being fond of cycling in the past, I decided to buy a bike, and maybe try to lose a few kilos with it. I didn't have too much time for looking around, so I bought a used (but in excellent shape) <a href=""http://www.scott-sports.com/global/en/products/221751005/bike-aspect-20-black-green-xs/"" rel=""nofollow"">Scott Aspect 20</a> from some guy living close by. </p>

<p>Now I'm wondering if the tires/wheels can hold me, and what pressure should I pump the tires to. </p>

<p>The rims are Alex TD17 32H and the tires are Schwalbe Hurricane 26x2.0 (2.5-5.0 bar). I'm planning to ride within the city (so mostly paved surfaces, maybe a few unpaved sections here and there). </p>
","<p>Offhand, that bike looks pretty good for your needs, aside from the front suspension and the 32H wheels.  The tires are good and wide, and if you keep them well inflated (<strong>above 4 bar</strong>) they should handle your weight OK.  </p>

<p>The front shock has lockout, so if it sags too much you can just keep it locked most of the time.  Of course, you will be stressing the wheels and tires, in particular, beyond what's ""normal"", so you may experience broken spokes and the like.  But since you won't be going offroad and probably won't jump too many curbs, you shouldn't do too badly.</p>

<p>You may find the seat not to your liking, but give it a try, and then shop around for something that looks better.</p>

<p>It's not a bike that will last 20 years with a 300lb rider, but you can probably get 2-3 years out of it, by which time you will be down to 80 kg and in the market for a carbon racer.</p>

"Front brake only on a fixed-gear bike","26398","","<p>Is it considered safe-enough to only have a front-brake on a fixie in a urban area that has many hills?  I've been considering buying one, but I want to get some opinions before I move forward.</p>
","<p>Yes. The front brake provides basically all of the stopping power in a bicycle, and recent tests in Bicycle Quarterly show that, in emergency stops, the distraction of attempting to use the rear brake may even increase stopping distance. Maximum bicycle braking power is achieved just before the bicycle starts to pitch over, as the rear wheel lifts off the ground. Once that occurs, it's trivial to lock the rear wheel with a brake or by using your legs on a fixed gear.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of having a front brake only in extremely hilly situations is not being able to dissipate some of the thermal load of braking between both rims, so you risk overheating the front.</p>

"How much do components really matter for a non-competitive rider?","26379","","<p>I do not ride competitively, but plan on doing some longer distance rides (+30 miles). I've read that better components are lighter, run more smoothly, and last longer. Out of those three categories, durability (lasting longer) is the only one that really matters for me, as long as the components don't break all the time and get the job done. Are the main advantages of high end components the reduced weight and smoother operation, or are they significantly more durable as well?</p>
","<p>I assume that you're talking about road biking. I can give you my opinion after using these groups for a while: Shimano Sora, Shimano Tiagra, Shimano 105, and now a full Shimano Ultegra. </p>

<p>All work, when properly adjusted and when shifting correctly. You have to do your homework and know how to shift smoothly, and adjust the gears. Whoever tells you that something is ""not good"" or ""does not work"" is lying or wants you to expend money. But of course different levels are there for a reason:</p>

<p>Weight: More expensive is lighter.
Stiffness: More expensive is stiffer, therefore transmitting your power better without loss of energy.
Ergonomics: More expensive groups tend to have a refined shape.
Reliability: More expensive groups tend to stay tuned longer than less expensive ones.
Shifting under pressure or more than one gear at the time: Expensive groups allow you to do it, cheaper ones don't.
Smoothness and speed: Shifting is faster and smoother on expensive groups.</p>

<p>If you notice, I put smoothness and speed last. It is usually one of the reasons that people mention as being key, but in my experience proper adjustment and proper shifting technique are more important than the group. My bike with Sora/Tiagra shifts as smoothly as the Ultegra after adjustment. But the other reasons are important to many people. Even if they don't compete they may want a light, stiff, and reliable group that makes the experience of biking more pleasurable (although the real pleasure is riding, of course), and they are willing to pay for it. They are undoubtedly ""nicer"".</p>

<p>Regarding durability, I'm skeptical about people's comments. Most of the times people change chains and cassettes because they are worn out, and upgrades/changes the rest of the group's components as new models appear, not necessarily because they don't ""last"". If you're a recreational rider, whatever you buy will ""last"" more than you will need.  I've seen 20 yr-old bikes that work perfectly, provided that the user changed the chain and cassette regularly. But remember durability and reliability are two different things.</p>

<p>At which point is not worth expending more money? Difficult to tell, but here is my suggestion (take it as a suggestion and nothing more):</p>

<p>Dura Ace or Sram Red if you compete.
Ultegra or Sram Force if you are an enthusiast that races or values to have a performance group.
105 or Sram Rival if you want a very nice recreational group.
Tiagra or Sram Apex if you want a solid recreational group.
Sora and below if you are a recreational rider that does not want to spend too much money.</p>

<p>EDIT: I recently had the luxury of trying a bike with electronic shifting (a Shimano Ultegra Di2) and I would like to add to my answer that in this case, the hype is true. It is a true revolutionary thing. Expensive, very expensive. Worth it? Probably not. But really good, yes.</p>

","<p>Both of those tires are quite close to the tires that you already have. There is a really good chance that they will fit. Because of the extra material in the SmartGuard layer these tires are taller than they are wide, but only by a couple of millimeters. So all you need to be concerned about is to look at the clearance on your bike with your current tires. Do you have decent clearance between the red of the tire and the crown of your fork and the bridges in the rear (or the fenders if you have the fenders installed)? 10-15 mm would be very comfortable, on my old Trek I've got like 5 mm. I don't have enough room to comfortably run fenders with my Marathons, but I'll be OK until the rain returns :-)</p>

<p>If you have enough room at the top, you probably also have room at the sides, but it is worth looking there too. The more generous the clearance the fewer hassles you'll run into with bits of junk on the road (it can get caught between the tire and the frame) or an out of true wheel – like if you break a spoke. From the look of the bike in the photos you should have plenty of room – the lower edges of the fenders appear to be aligned with the full diameter of the tires and the specs say that the bike comes with 37 mm tires.</p>

<p>I noticed the final geometry and rideability was pretty good, and since the frame has a long headtube (which I desire) I guess the inseam problem might not be so important considering the main goal is randonneuring, where ""riding"" characteristics are much more important than ""mounting and dismounting"" characteristics. Most probably the bike will receive a drop handlebar, even though I like flat bars a lot.</p>

","<h1>Frame fit</h1>

<p>Primarily, a bike fits if you can position pedals, saddle and handlebars relative to each other so that they match your body's proportions. Secondarily, when these contact have been set, other frame parameters should fall into place so that the riding characteristics are as desired. That includes e.g. toe clip overlap, stand over height, bottom bracket height, heel/panniers clearance, steering geometry, or that an extremely short or long stem gives a weird steering balance. Depending on what you use the bike for, the importance of these parameters varies.</p>

<h1>Does ""frame size"" equal ""seat tube length""?</h1>

<p>If you consider frame fit as putting the contact points in the right spots, the length and angle of the seat tube is one of the less important dimensions. By choosing the right seat post length and setback, it is possible to put the saddle in the right position relative to the pedals (or, simplified, the bottom bracket). Generally, on most frames, most riders can put the saddle in the right position relative to the bottom bracket.</p>

<p>Depending on the use of the bike stand over height (or clearance) is more (MTB) or less (road) important. If you want a certain stand over clearance, of course this limits the frame size to a certain amount. This is easy to determine: With the correct tires and wheels, the height of the top tube should be lower than the length of your inseam.</p>

<h1>How to determine ""frame size"" instead</h1>

<p>The critical point is often if you can put your handlebars of choice in the right spot, too. One thing to consider here is that drop handlebars have a significantly longer reach than straight ones. This is because the normal hand position is on or behind the brake lever hoods with a drop bar, and not on the straight section next to the stem eye. If one does not want to resort to extremely short or long stems, a frame usually only allows for a good fit with either drop or straight bars.</p>

<p>Working backwards from the hand position through handlebars and a normal sized stem (ca. 8-12cm on a classic frame like this), one ends up at a certain position where the top of the head tube should be.</p>

<h2>Stack and reach</h2>

<p>The corresponding frame dimensions are the vertical and horizontal distances of the head tube upper end from the bottom bracket, called <a href=""http://www.cervelo.com/en/engineering/thinking-and-processes/geometry-and-fit.html"">stack and reach</a>. Unfortunately especially frame reach is quite difficult to measure on a frame without complicated measurement setups (or a good picture exactly from the side without perspective distortions). Therefore many tend to use top tube length as an alternative to reach, and (""virtual"") seat tube length instead of stack. One should be careful though: The position of the top of the head tube not only depends on seat tube and top tube lengths, but also on the seat tube angle (which can be even harder to measure than reach).</p>

<p>The easiest way to find out your needs regarding stack and reach is to measure a bike which fits you well and has the relevant handlebars setup. One way to do this is to take a photo exactly from the side and from quite far away, and measure in the picture.</p>

<h1>What does this mean for you?</h1>

<p>As you say, stand over clearance does not bother you with this frame, so the seat tube length is very likely ok. On the picture there is also plenty of room to move the saddle forwards, in the worst case with a zero setback seat post. So the saddle probably position fits you. Good.</p>

<p>I am more concerned about whether the frame reach is too long, when changing to a drop bar. But as far as I know, the classic Raleigh road geometries do not have overly long reach, and the stem shown on your picture is way longer than what I would consider aesthetically pleasing on a frame like this (especially with quite little seat post to be seen).</p>

<p>Without knowing more about the frame and your fit preferences it is very hard to advise if it will fit you in this regard. The fact that the frame was built with a classic quill stem in mind, but has a threadless fork today, does not make it easier: It may be that you can't rise the bars enough with an ahead stem (and the fork already being cut).</p>

<p>The easiest thing would be to just try putting a drop bar on the frame (ideally with an adjustable stem temporarily). With a fixed gear that should be easy to do. Ride and adjust, and you will feel if it fits.</p>

<h1>What else?</h1>

<p>Apart from all that I think that the average 56cm frame is quite a bit too small for the average 1.88m male (horizontal top tube, or ""virtual seat tube length"" assumed). I am 1.83m myself and usually start looking around what is labelled as 58cm.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that the fork is not original. Ask the seller if the original still exists. It probably is a threaded fork, which allows for higher building quill stems. And it probably looks nicer, too.</p>

<p>Finally: I have never heard about problems with the thighs rubbing on the seat stays before...</p>

","<p>While this may in fact be a serious problem which needs attention, it can also be normal. The first thing you need to do is define what you mean by leak. </p>

<p>If it is a thin and light coat of oil on on fork stanchion, this is very likely normal.</p>

<p>If it is a puddle, pool, or drip of oil on the fork leg, this is more than likely a problem. It can be a failed fork seal, or a a damaged damping or lockout cartridge. </p>

<p>Both of these can be caused by over compression of the fork. It could also a be a defect in the fork, which should be replaced. Do you have an LBS you trust? If so, take the bike to them and ask.</p>

<p>Be aware that there are other things that can cause this that may not be damage. How do you store the bike? Do you hang it up on the wall by the wheel or set it upside down on the bars and saddle?</p>

<p>Leaving the fork in a position to have oil draining against the seal can allow it to seep through, but that is normal. I know this is a bit ambiguous, but there is no way to give an answer with certainty without seeing the fork. Post a picture of the leak, and we can be more helpful.</p>

"What maintenance does a front suspension fork need?","25778","","<p>I've just bought a used bike on eBay, its a 2002 Marin Bobcat Trail. It has 'In-Sync 266' suspension forks. This is my first suspension bike so I need some guidance in the use and maintenance of these forks. I can't find any user manuals or anything online. Perhaps someone has one they could send me? Failing that, here are the questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fork feels very soft to me, but I am a heavy rider and I'm not used to suspension forks. How do I know if the fork is working 'right'?</p></li>
<li><p>What maintenance can/should I carry out on the fork?</p></li>
<li><p>On the left hand side (only) there is an adjustment knob labelled just + and -. What does this do and how do I know how to adjust it? Why is it only on one side?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That should be enough to be going on with, any answers very much appreciated.</p>

<p>For guidance, my last bike was a 1995 Marin Bear Valley SE, hardtail, no suspension. AWESOME bike that served me well for over 17 years, until it was stolen a few months ago. I did all my own maintenance and I consider myself a competent cycle mechanic, its just that my skills are relevant to 17-year-old bikes :)</p>
","<ol>
<li>The fork is ""right"" if it has the right ""sag"", that is, if it lowers a bit when you get on the bike. The right sag is no less than 10%, no more than 25% of total travel, for a regular bike (non-downhill, non-special-purpose);</li>
<li>Basically three ""areas"" must be addressed on maintenance:
<ol>
<li>Cleaning the inside, for removal of old oil/grease, water, mud, grime, rust, etc.</li>
<li>Caring for the damping elements, which could be elastomer, coil, air chamber, open oil bath, etc. That would vary a lot depending on the type;</li>
<li>Lubing the telescopic parts, which are responsible for the movement of the fork. Depending on the type (open oil bath, for example) the damping oil and the stanchion-lubing oil is the same, so it is serviced together.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is called ""preload"", and probably increases or decreases the compression of a coil spring or elastomer. That is for the adjustment of ""sag"" according to your weight, being equivalent to say that it lets the fork ""harder"" or ""softer"".</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I know, the brand of your fork is on the cheap end of the quality spectrum, so it's possible that it doesn't work perfectly, or at least not as perfectly as higher-end models. I'd say that, if it ""works"", meaning if it saves your body (hands mostly) from shaking over bumps, then keep it, even if it has too much sag, or some play, or is not so light. But if it ""gives up"" working too soon (say, you go over bumps and it barely moves, or you feel the bumps hard on your hands), than it is well worth to change it for a better model.</p>

<p>If you decide you'll keep it and service it yourself, I'd recommend purchasing some grease/oil (check which you'll need for your specific model) that's made specifically for bike suspension. A lot of lubricants I've inadvertedly used in the past contained some sort of adhesive (to stick to the metal surfaces and protect them), and the lubrication became gluey as soon as the bike hit some dusty path. On the other hand, fluids intended for suspensions or hydraulic systems tend to expel impurities and keep flowing nice over time.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've found some photos and reviews online, of your fork (search words: ""sync 266 fork""). By that (plastic upper caps, dust ""accordions"" around the telescopes) and by the reviews description (mtbr.com), I'd say it is a low-end fork, thus without any hydraulic valves inside, most probably elastomer or coil spring. You should be able to disassemble it at home ""no-fear"".</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I think the spring is still strong enough because just a small nudge is enough. I haven't been fiddling with the two adjuster screws, and -as I said- if I nudge the derailleur after shifting it jumps to the correct position. The issue seems to be the (admittedly pretty large) amount of gunk that has gotten stuck in the derailleur over the years. I tried applying some WD-40 to the moving parts but two small applications have not really helped remove the gunk. Is this still the way to go or is there a better way to get the gunk out without completely removing the derailleur (which I -for now- am too lazy to do).</p>

<p><a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/8415/front-derailleur-doesnt-seem-to-be-moving"">This question</a> deals with a similar problem, but it hasn't moved beyond the diagnosis part (which I have already done I think).</p>

<p>[update:]</p>

<p>I tried liberally applying WD-40 a few times over the course of a week, including some (aided by hand on the derailleur) shifting after each application. This mostly removed the issue when shifting from 3 to 2, but 2 to 1 remained. Today I went to my local car-cleaning station and applied a high-pressure hose to the derailleur. This removed all the visible gunk. I applied some oil,  now shifting is as smooth as can be given the state of my chain and chainrings.</p>
","<p>If you believe you have diagnosed the problem then a clean and a service should be all that is required. You don't have to remove the FD.</p>

<p>WD-40 will not displace mud effectively. I would: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>use a hose with a decent amount of pressure to remove the gunk, wait for it to dry. (be careful not to spray around the bottom bracket)</p></li>
<li><p>apply WD-40 to any moving parts on the derailleur but focus on the pivot points to remove old lube. </p></li>
<li><p>once the WD-40 has evaporated apply some decent chain lube to the pivots.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If this doesn't fix the problem and the cable is moving freely the derailleur may be bent or the spring has lost the required tension.</p>

"Hydraulic Disk brake piston not fully retracting","25537","","<p>My front disk brake's piston doesn't fully retract.  While I can ride the bike, the brake is slightly rubbing.  (IE, if I just spin the wheel with my hand, it'll go around about one and a half times and then stop.) It's definitely slowing me down. </p>

<p>If this fixable?</p>

<p>The advice I got was that it's not worth the trouble and to buy a replacement set.  The current brakes are Avid Juicy 7s that are about 7 years old</p>
","<p>I would try repairing them before binning them and purchasing the Shimano upgrade. If there is no obvious fluid leak around the piston the seals are likely in good order and you've got a sticky piston rather than a failed calliper. This is a simple fix:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove wheel and brake pads.</li>
<li>Using a flat headed item hold the working piston in.</li>
<li>Squeeze the lever, the non-retracting piston should be fully out.</li>
<li>While holding the lever wipe around the piston with a clean lint free cloth.</li>
<li>Still holding lever lubricate the retracting bit of the piston with a bit of brake fluid (DOT 4 or 5.1, <strong>not</strong> oil, as this may damage the seals and/or might work through the seals and mix with the brake fluid)</li>
<li>Release the lever and repeat lubricating 5 more times, the piston should now be retracting.</li>
<li>Wipe off any residual brake fluid from the caliper.</li>
<li>Use a brake block to push both pistons evenly back into the caliper. Pull the lever with the block in to align.</li>
<li>Refit the pads and wheel.</li>
<li>Realign the caliper.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note, never pull the lever when there's nothing in between the two pistons. It's hard to separate pads and near impossible to separate pistons without bleeding.</p>

<p>Juicy 7s were good brakes, if they aren't broken there's no point rushing out to replace them.</p>

"What's the safest way to turn left from a right-side bike lane?","25507","","<p>(United States road configuration and customs here. Sorry, those of you who drive on the left!)</p>

<p>On my trip home, I use a bike lane near the right side of a very busy one-way arterial street; there is a bus/right-turn lane between the bike lane and the curb. I need to turn left, crossing three lanes of traffic, at a T-intersection (no street to the right). My options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn left directly from the bike lane.</li>
<li>Keeping a weather eye on traffic, move into the left-hand lane and turn from there.</li>
<li>Veer right onto the sidewalk (avoiding buses, obviously); wait for the pedestrian light to cross.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these is the canonically correct way to manage, assuming heavy car traffic?</p>
","<p>By heavy I suppose you mean heavier than you'd like it to be, or heavier than you can live with comfortably.</p>

<p>It's probably possible, sometimes, to change lanes beforehand, going to the left one to do the left turn, if the traffic is not so heavy, but that would, I think, violate your pre-condition that the traffic IS heavy.</p>

<p>Then, the canonical way to do it would be getting to the margin of the flow (in this case, the sidewalk), and waiting for a comfortable opportunity (in this case, the pedestrian light).</p>

<p>Turn left directly is a very bad behaviour, as it adds a lot of unpredictability and leaves a small time window and a small margin of safety for you and for any other user of the public way. Besides, as it seems, it is illegal.</p>

"Should inner tube have excess length?","25304","","<p>I've recently changed the default 700x35 tires and 35mm Schrader inner tube to 700x25 slicks with 25mm Presta inner tubes.</p>

<p>However whilst fitting the new tire and inner tube, I noticed that the inner tube had about an inch or two of excess length to it. This mean I had to tuck it into the tire, doubled back on itself.</p>

<p>I've doubled checked the inner tube packaging and it's definitively for a 700 diameter rim.</p>

<p>I presumed that it would sort itself out when I pumped up the tires. Is this normal? </p>
","<p>A tube should not have excess length, and doubling on itself will cause the tire to feel uneven while riding, as well as increase the likelihood of flats.</p>

<p>Assuming the tube is the correct size for the tire, as you said it was, there are 2 common causes for this problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you installed the tube without inflating it first, just a tiny amount, then it hasn't got the shape to sit in the tire completely, and it will appear to be too long. It isn't, just add enough air to the tube to give it a little shape and try it again.</p></li>
<li><p>If you did that already, then in the process of inflating the tube to make easier to install in the tire, you have probably inflated it too much, and so it has gotten larger. It's not permanent, just let the air out and inflate it only enough to give it shape before installing it in the tire.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If these don't work, there is likely a problem in manufacturing, and you should get the tube exchanged.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

"How can you speed a road-bike up?","25263","","<p>So, I have an 80's raleigh bike, reassembled from spare parts.  I'm wondering what the best way to get more speed out of the bike is.  Wheels?  Gears?  Lighter gear? Different pedals? I'm rather fond of the frame, so I'd rather not replace that.  </p>
","<p>Gabe,  If you love the frame, and are willing to spend the money to keep it, start upgrading everything else.  Start with:</p>

<p>Wheels/tires - rotating mass will slow you down the most - go to aluminum wheels and thin/light tires size 23 or 25.</p>

<p>Bottom Crank - Once again rotating mass, you can get some hollow core cranks, and adjust the chainring sizes to the biggest you can push.  You can save a few grams by going to a compact crank versus a triple.</p>

<p>Shifters/derailleur(s) - get some aero shifters/brakes, and upgrade to a lighter front/rear derailleur.</p>

<p>Seat post, handlebars, stem - On an old raleigh, they are probably steel - you can get inexpensive aluminum replacements.</p>

<p>Seat - get rid of the OG heavy seat and get something more comfortable and lighter.</p>

<p>From expensive and most effective, to least expensive/effective, thats the list off the top of my head.</p>

"What's the easiest way to add gears to my single speed?","25076","","<p>I recently bought a single speed - a Charge Plug Racer, and I realise I've made a mistake - too many hills on my commute and I need a smaller gear to help me up the hills. It's pretty hilly in my area.</p>

<p>I still like the simplicity of the bike, but cannot get up all these hills!</p>

<p>What's the easiest way to add a gear?</p>
","<p>Depending on what you want, you might just be okay lowering the current gearing.  It comes with a 42t chainring and a 16t freewheel, and switching to a 17t or 18t freewheel will decrease your overall top speed somewhat but make it easier to climb up those hills.  If you want to have the option to swap for a harder gear when you're planning a mostly flat ride, you could either install a different sized freewheel in place of your fixed cog (on the flip side) or get something like a <a href=""http://www.whiteind.com/singlespeedgearing/freewheels.html"">White Industries DOS</a> 2-speed freewheel.  In either case, you'd change gearing by loosening the rear wheel and moving the chain position by hand.</p>

<p>If you want to switch to a true multispeed bike, you've got a couple options. Easiest might be to purchase a new wheel built around an internal gear hub.  Your rear dropout spacing is 120mm, and there are a few hubs that come in or can be reduced to near that width - notably the Shimano Nexus 8 Red Band, the SRAM P5, and several of the Sturmey Archer hubs can be made to work.  You could also look into getting the frame <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/frame-spacing.html"">cold set</a> to a wider dropout spacing, which would open up more IGH options (the Alfine 8 being a great one) as well as conventional multi-speed cassettes - though you'll need to get a derailleur hanger chain tug, like those made by DMR.</p>

"Not sure about using a Co2 Cartridge","25055","","<p>I have a road bike (Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6). I bought it this past March. In addition, I purchased an inflator. It came with, I presume, a 16g cartridge. I haven't had the need to use this yet. I understand that one of these can put 130lb of pressure in a 27"" tire. My tires are designed to hold 105-110lb. I don't want to overinflate my tire. How do I know when I've put 110lb of air in my tire? With my floor pump, this is no problem. I set the pump to 110 and I can't put more in when I reach this amount. I don't want to blow my tire out with one of these cartridges.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
","<p>These cartridges are intended to inflate a tire in an emergency situation, like during a race, or for example during a ride on the country-side, far away from gas stations ;o)</p>

<p>(or, by the way, just to save your arm muscles from inflating a skinny tire up to a very high pressure)</p>

<p>When they say ""up to 130 PSI"", I think the manufacturers want the potential customers to be sure that the product actually might achieve 130 PSI if needed. For, say, 700x20 tires (very skinny ones), that would be a very reasonable pressure.</p>

<p>To use the cartridge, it must be attached to an inflator, which allows you to control how much pressure you desire. The key issue is: since there is not a pressure gauge, the only way to know the right point is to know beforehand what the right pressure ""feels like"" with your current tire, and then trying to replicate that after you fix the tire, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thumb-checking the tire so that it is ""hard enough"";</li>
<li>Grabbing the seat or the handlebars and hitting the wheel against the floor so that it is ""hard enough"";</li>
<li>Riding the bike while looking at the bulge around the ground-contact area, so that it ""looks right"";</li>
<li>Riding the bike while hitting small irregularities on the ground, so that it ""feels right"".</li>
</ul>

<p>(unfortunately the gauge from my floor pump broke, and I am becoming expert on ""sensitive"" tire inflation methods :o(</p>

<p>As a bottom line, if your tire is designed for 110 PSI max., that doesn't mean (at all!) that it will instantly explode as soon as it reaches anything beyond that pressure, because that is the maximum pressure recommended to BE RIDDEN. If you get, say, 130 PSI with the cartridge, you'll probably feel it is too much, so you can deflate it a bit before riding. In the end, between too hard and too soft, there is a lot of room for personal taste, specially if you just want to go on riding, after a flat.</p>

<p>Just as an example: I had (have?) a lot of friends who ride mountain bikes with knobby tires up to 80 PSI (it's crazy, I know), just because the bike ""rides much better on asphalt"". So far, no explosion happened (except one with a very low quality tire targeted at 40 PSI max... The girl literally hugged the road, but she was ok...)</p>

"How to fix problem with mountain bike chain falling off gears?","25041","","<p>The chain on my girlfriend's bike came off the front gear today, it looks like the back gear changing mechanism isn't handling back-pedaling properly, whenever she pedals backwards the chain slacks rather than feeding through.</p>

<p>The chain doesn't seem to be taut enough and has at one point gone round the front gear and caught in the front gear changing mechanism.</p>

<p>Any idea what might be wrong? I'm sorry if I've got my terminology completely wrong here.</p>

<p>It's a 21 speed mountain bike if that helps.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I've looked up the terminology now and it seems like there might be a problem with the rear derailer? It doesn't seem to be keeping the chain taut at the top and is just getting pulled almost to its limit towards the front of the bike.</p>
","<p>Yeah, first clean the rear derailer well.  Simplest way to do this is to lean the bike against a wall (outside, where you can make a mess), slide some newspapers up behind the derailer and drape them down the the wheel (to keep from dripping all over the tire), then spray the derailer well with WD-40, using an old toothbrush to clean it up a bit.</p>

<p>Afterwards, wipe the derailer dry, then oil it up well with a heavy oil (preferably bike chain oil).</p>

<p>If the bike has more than maybe 2000 miles on it then likely the chain is worn out, and possibly the rear sprockets have developed a ""hook"".  A bike shop can check for this with a special gauge, and replace the chain if it's too badly worn.  (If ""hook"" has developed a new chain will help a bit, but the rear sprockets may need to be replaced.)</p>

<p>Regardless, likely the rear derailer is out of adjustment.  It's not very complicated to adjust, but it takes a touch of mechanical ability to understand which way to turn things.  But mainly it's a matter of adjusting the cable tightness, which is usually done by turning a knob on the cable near the shift lever or elsewhere along the cable route.</p>

<p>The other odd possibilities for this problem are that spring has broken in the derailer (or sometimes the spring has just ""jumped"" off the tang where it's supposed to be hooked), or some jackleg replaced the chain and didn't get the length right.</p>

So my question is:</p>

<p>How much does the head tube angle affect the fit and feel of a bicycle? I'm sure that it has at least some effect over the fit of the bicycle, but how much? And I'm guessing it has an even bigger effect on the steering, but again, how much?</p>
","<p>there's a good write-up about this here: <a href=""http://www.calfeedesign.com/tech-papers/geometry-of-bike-handling/"">http://www.calfeedesign.com/tech-papers/geometry-of-bike-handling/</a></p>

<p>In general the steeper the angle the more agile the steering. If you like steeper you might say ""quicker, more response"", if you didn't like steeper you might say ""twitchier"".</p>

<p>A 1/2 degree difference is probably not going to make that much difference by itself. The other factors, which headset, installation of headset, stem length, handlebar type and setup, etc., will mask the differences here. As the Calfee page mentions, people will adjust very quickly.</p>

"Front wheel ""shudder"" or ""pulse"" when braking","24848","","<p>When I apply the front brake I can feel a ""shudder"" or ""pulse"" through the front wheel, fork and handlebars. It's faster when I'm travelling faster and slower when I'm moving slower.</p>

<p>I assume there's something wrong with the rim, causing the brake pads to catch (rim braking, not discs). But I've checked the rim carefully and can't see anything. There isn't any ledges and I can't see that parts of the rim are wider than other parts (although I haven't checked with calipers or anything since I don't have any). It's happened since the wheels were new. They're <a href=""http://chargebikes.com/parts/dish/"">Charge Dish</a> wheels. I've used multiple different brake pads and they have all had this problem (to varying degrees).</p>

<ul>
<li>The bike is an SE Lager, about 18 months old. I'm running Conti GP4000S 23mm tyres.</li>
<li>I've spun the wheel and eyeballed the rim/pad clearance. I can't see any noticeable bulge, but I'm assuming that's what's causing the problem.</li>
<li>It's a large frame (I'm 6'3"")</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions. If there is a bulge in the rim can I fix it, or do I need to replace it?</p>
","<p>By your description, it totally seems to be some slight irregularity on rim surface, be it a bent spot, some fluctuation around valve-hole or seam, or some slight variation on total width.</p>

<p>I had the exact problem you described three times: after hitting a pothole too hard once, and after my bike fell off a moving car's bike rack thereafter.</p>

<p>Both times, it was some rim irregularity, and it was on the same rim. First time, I kept riding and the very rim wearing out with braking eventually solved the problem. Second time, I had to put a new rim, because the ""pulse"" was very intense and dangerous (fork flexing and all).</p>

<p>The third time I had this problem, I had a defective rim which eventually cracked on the side, and I felt a progressive worsening of this ""pulse"".</p>

<p>AND HERE GOES THE SOLUTION!</p>

<p>I noticed this irregularity caused an assymmetric MONLIGHT REFLECTION because I was riding at night, leaned the bike to the side, and was marevelled by the beautiful circle of moonlight on the shiny breaking surface of the rim. But there was a bent spot, pretty much invisible to direct observation.</p>

<p>So, I propose you go with your bike close to a shadowed wall on a very sunny day, and use the braking surface of the rim to reflect sunlight on this shadowed wall, optionally letting the wheel turn slowly, and repeating the procedure with the other side of the rim.</p>

<p>For sure, if there is a bent spot, the slightest one, you will see it.</p>

<p>You can increase the distance to the wall to make the effect more obvious, and you should expect some natural assymmetry. The ""abnormal"" thing to watch would be a very localized spot of aberrant light distrtibution.</p>

<p>EDIT: suppose you found the micro-bent spot, a good way to wear it away is to put not-so-expensive brake pads, go to your favourite muddy downhill track in a wet day (preferrably one where the weels completely sink in the mud), and use the brakes mercyless. Your rim will begin to shine!! (pun intended ;o)</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>(well, you could always turn the bike upside down, spin the wheel, close your eyes, and literally feel variations on rim surface with your bare fingers. It is not so sensitive as the sunlight method. Do it with caution!)</p>

Hub Overhaul and Adjustment
This article will discuss the adjustment and overhaul of ""cup-and-cone"" hubs. These hubs allow for access to internal bearings, and are adjustable. See related article for</p>

<p>Freehub Service.
Bicycle hubs may be either the adjustable cup-and-cone type or the non-adjustable cartridge style. The adjustable type bearing surfaces can be adjusted for bearing play. The cartridge types typically cannot be adjusted for wear or play. Both types can come in either the freehub type or the thread-on freewheel style.</p>

<p>A basic bearing system is seen below. The cup is normally a permanent press fit into the hub shell. The cone traps the ball bearing. The locknut is tightened against the cone to prevent the cone from moving. If there is looseness from bearing play, the cone can be move closer to the cup.</p>

<p>The modern freehubs tend to be more complex. The hub will have a freehub mechanism attached to the hub. The cassette cogs attach to the freehub. It is possible to remove and service the freehub in a separate operation. See Freehub Service. A typical rear hub with freehub is seen below.</p>

<p>Cup and cone type freehub</p>

<p>Cartridge Bearing Hubs
Hubs using the cartridge type bearings are not serviceable in the sense they can be dismantled and adjusted. As cartridge bearings wear and develop play, the entire cartridge unit is replaced. Cartridge hub service is not covered in this article.</p>

<p>Common cartridge bearing type hub</p>

<p>Hub overhaul
For rear hubs, begin by removing rear cogs. Remove quick release skewer. If it is a solid axle type, remove axle nuts.
Inspect axle ends. Measure and note the amount of axle protruding past locknut. For quick release hubs, counting the number of threads is an adequate measurement.</p>

<p>(OPTIONAL) Mount in axle vise, if possible. Mount right side down with left side facing upward. Generally, dismantle from the left side.
Remove any rubber cover. Use a tie or string to hold small parts in the same orientation as they came off of hub.
Hold cone using cone wrench, and loosen locknut counter-clockwise.</p>

<p>Remove locknut and any washers, placing them on the tie.</p>

<p>Remove cone by turning counter-clockwise.
Place hand below right side, and lift wheel slowly. Be prepared to catch bearings that fall from hub. Place wheel on bench.
If inspecting bent axle, remove right side locknut and cones. Note that left side and right side cones, washers and locknuts may be different. Do not confuse left and right side parts. Use tie method to keep track of parts. Also note axle thread may be asymmetrical. The side with more axle spacers gets more axle thread.</p>

<p>Count the number of bearings on each side, and then use pencil magnet to remove bearings from hub shell.</p>

<p>For many hub models, it is possible and recommended to overhaul with the pressed dust caps in place. Dust caps may be fragile and removal may result in damage. Work around dust caps when cleaning and inspecting.
Wipe and clean all parts. Parts must be dry for assembly. Wipe freehub mechanism out using damp rag. Do not soak freehub in solvent. Freehub bodies are lubricated internally with a light lubricant, and soaking them with solvent will remove lubrication. For freehub service, see Freehub Service.
Hub and Parts Inspection
View hub cups and cones for pitting or damage. Also use a ballpoint pen to trace the bearing path. Roughness and wear will be felt as the small ball of the pen passes over pits.</p>

<p>        </p>

<p>Inspect ball bearings for shininess and brightness. If balls are dull looking, they should be replaced. If the cup is damaged, it typically cannot be replaced. A new hub would be required. Cones are typically available as replacement parts.</p>

<p>If inspecting axle, roll axle on flat surface. View axle close to surface and watch for gap appearing as axle rolls. Bent axles cannot be re-bent. A new axle is required.</p>

<p>Hub Assembly
Grease axle threads.
Grease heavily inside hub shell cups.
Place ball bearings in both cups and cover with more grease. Make sure balls are seated flat in cup. For rear hubs, the common number is 9 balls of 1/4-inch diameter per side. For front hubs, the common number is 10 balls of 3/16-inch diameter per side.</p>

<p>If all parts were removed from axle, install right side parts. Use care to install in the same orientation as they came off. Return axle protrusion to the original measurement, as noted earlier. Tighten cone locknut fully.
Install axle through right side of hub.
Install left side axle parts, using care to install in the same orientation as they came off. Do not set axle protrusion on this side and do not tighten locknut at this time.
For quick release type hubs, snug the cone down until it contacts the ball bearings, and turn back counter-clockwise one quarter turn (90 degrees). This will purposely make the bearing adjustment too loose. Hold cone with cone wrench and tighten locknut fully. Proceed to HUB ADJUSTMENT below.
NOTE: For quick release wheels, it is critical the axle end sit inboard or recessed inside the frame or fork dropout. This allows the quick release skewer to secure onto the frame or fork end. If the axle end protrudes even a very small amount, the wheel may not properly secure and may come out during use. In the image below the axle end is only slightly too long. If the hub is the correct width, check the axle is centered between the locknuts. It may be necessary to grind off the axle end until it is safely recessed.</p>

<p>Hub Adjustment
Quick release hubs have hollow axles that flex slightly when the quick release is closed. Hub bearing adjustments must account for this extra pressure. When a quick release hub is not clamped tight in the frame, there should be a slight amount of play in the axle. This play disappears when the hub and wheel are clamped in the frame.</p>

<p>To test if a hub in your bike has an adequate adjustment, grab the wheel while it is still in the frame and pull it side to side laterally. Turn wheel and test again, feeling for a knocking sensation. If no play is felt, remove the wheel. Grab the axle (not the skewer) and rock it up and down to check for play. If the axle has play when the wheel is outside the bike, but no play inside the bike, the adjustment is adequate. If there is no play in the axle when the wheel is outside the bike, the adjustment is too tight, even if the axle seems to turn smoothly when out of the bike.</p>

<p>Bearing Adjustment and ""Feel""
Bearing surfaces are made from hardened steel. The surfaces are cut typically by grinding. Round ball bearings roll on the curved surface of the cup and cone. Even the highest quality bearing surfaces will have slight grinding marks. In the left image below is a high quality cone magnified two hundred times. Notice the parallel marks from the grinding stone. Also note a slight pit from wear. The right hand image is a bearing magnified the same amount. It does show some surface marking, but is generally smoother than the cone or cup. Bearing surface smoothness will vary between manufacturers and between models. Some bearing system will simply ""feel"" smoother because they are smoother. This is why it is difficult to adjust by using a subjective feeling of smoothness. Generally, adjust bearings for the loosest setting that has no knocking or play, regardless of this relative smoothness.
        </p>

<p>The following adjustment procedures simulate the on-the-bike compression while still allowing access to the left side cone and locknut for adjustment. The bicycle frame and skewer act as a holder for the wheel and the axle. The set up of the wheel on the frame may seem unusual. Follow directions carefully.</p>

<p>NOTE: Some frames and dropouts will not allow clamping the wheel as described. The hub or spokes may contact the frame. It is possible to find spacers to simulate the dropout. Additionally, an alternative to the procedure below is to adjust the bearings with the wheel unclamped. Mount the wheel in the frame to test the adjustment. Remove as necessary, adjust, and re-test.</p>

<p>Mount bike in repair stand.
Remove rear wheel from bike. If adjusting front wheel, remove front wheel as well.
Remove quick release skewer and springs. Remove any rubber boot covering left side cones and locknuts.
Insert skewer through cog side of hub. Install quick release adjusting nut on non-cog side. There must be a gap between the skewer adjusting nut and the locknut. The quick release nut must press only on the axle, not on the locknut.</p>

<p>Place cog side of wheel into left rear dropout. Non-cog side sits outboard of the bike, and is accessible to mechanic. If the cogs touch or interfere with the frame, remove rear cogs. Front wheel: either left or right side goes to rear dropout. Adjustment is done from side opposite clamped side.</p>

<p>Adjust quick release until tension is same as when normally clamping wheel in bike. Resistance to closing should begin half way through swing to fully closed. If in doubt see Wheel Installation.</p>

<p>Check bearings for play. Hold end of axle on non-cog side with one hand and rock rim laterally with other hand. Play in bearings will be felt as a knocking in the axle. If play is felt, proceed to step #9 below.</p>

<p>If no play is felt, adjustment is potentially too tight. Purposely create excess bearing play as the first step to proper adjustment.
A. Use a cone wrench and hold cone from moving. Note position and angle of wrench.</p>

<p>B. Use another wrench on locknut. Turn locknut counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>

<p>C. Loosen cone by turning cone wrench counter-clockwise about 1/4 turn, or 90 degrees.</p>

<p>D. Hold cone from moving with cone wrench and tighten locknut. Locknut must be fully tight before play can be checked.</p>

<p>E. Test for play by holding axle and moving rim laterally.</p>

<p>If play is felt, adjustment is too loose. Tighten adjustment:
A. Use a cone wrench and hold cone from moving. Note position and angle of wrench.</p>

<p>B. Use another wrench on locknut and loosen by turning counter-clockwise.</p>

<p>C. Recall angle of cone wrench and tighten adjustment by turning cone clockwise 1/32nd of a turn. Imagine cone wrench extending to the rim. Move end of wrench only the distance from one nipple to the next at the rim. This approximates 1/32nd of a turn for thirty-six and thirty-two spoke rims.</p>

<p>D. Hold cone from moving with cone wrench and tighten locknut. Locknut must be fully tight before play can be checked.</p>

<p>Test again for play by holding axle with one hand and moving rim laterally with the other hand. Rotate wheel and check for play all the way around wheel rotation.
If play is still present, repeat adjustment step above until play just disappears. Remember to make small adjustments clockwise one at a time. Check for play at rim after each adjustment. It is likely it will take several small adjustments.
Once play has disappeared, test final adjustment. Open skewer partially (about 45 degrees) and check again for play by rotating wheel and checking several points. If play is felt during this test, hub is adjusted.</p>

<p>If no play is felt during final skewer check, the adjustment is too tight. To adjust, first CLOSE SKEWER, loosen locknut and loosen adjustment only slightly. Tighten locknut and check adjustment for play, then test again by opening skewer to 45-degreee. Adjustment is finished when there is no play felt when skewer is closed, but some play is felt when skewer is partially open.
Remove wheel from bike and return skewer and springs to normal position. Replace any rubber covers. Notice there is play in axle. This play disappears when wheel is clamped in place for use. You must use the same skewer setting for riding as for adjusting the hub.
Remount cogs, if removed, and install wheel into bike. It is necessary to duplicate the quick release setting of hub adjustment when installing wheel.
Misc. Notes: If hub will not adjust smoothly, the bearing surfaces may be worn out. If play does not disappear until bearing adjustment is very tight, right side locknut may not be tight against cone, or cups inside hub shell may be loose.</p>

<p>HUB ADJUSTMENT- SOLID AXLE TYPE
Non-quick release hub systems use axle nuts and washers on the outside of the dropouts to hold the wheel in place. Adjustment of solid axle hub bearings is similar to the hollow axle quick release type, but there is no need to allow for axle flex. Mount the wheel in the frame similar to quick release hubs as described above. Tighten the axle nut inside the dropout that is holding the wheel. The axle is now held tight. Check for bearing play. If no play is present, create play by loosening bearing adjustment, then adjust in small increments until play in gone. The goal is to find the loosest adjustment that has no play. Remove the wheel from the bike. The adjustment for solid axle hubs does not change when mounted in the bike.</p>

<p>HUB-CARTRIDGE BEARING TYPE
These types of hubs use an industrial type-bearing unit. The inner and outer rotating races and ball bearings are installed as a unit. These hubs are not serviceable in the sense they are overhauled and adjusted. When the cartridge bearings are worn, rough, or have play, the cartridge should be replaced. The bearing unit is then removed and a new one pressed in. This requires special tools and is best left to professional mechanics.</p>

"Using a ski helmet for winter biking","24805","","<p>I am curious if anyone uses a skiing helmet for winter biking? Would this be safe? Are skiing helmets designed to protect you from the same kind of accidents that you would have on a bike?  </p>

<p>My thinking is that a ski helmet would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help to keep your ears warm</li>
<li>Would fit well with ski goggles (which fit poorly with my bike helmet)</li>
<li>Not have air vents in it which make you cold in the winter</li>
</ul>
","<p>I wear a Bern Brentwood with a winter liner in cold weather. It's a certified bike helmet, but designed more like a ski helmet. The winter liner does a great job of keeping my ears warm without wearing any other protection, but doesn't block traffic noise. It is vented, but not well enough that it makes my head cold. It also has a clip in the back for ski goggles if you're using them. With the summer liner it works well for fall and spring, too. </p>

"I need help replacing my bike's tube","24661","","<p>I recently popped the tube in my front tire and need help replacing it. I don't really know very much about bikes or the assortment of numbers on tubes, tires, and wheels. Here is what I do know:</p>

<p>The tire that popped has 700x35/43C on it.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qr1vf.jpg"" alt=""Old Tire""></p>

<p>The spare that I got when I bought the bike has A2 25/32 x 622/635 on it. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/khvEN.jpg"" alt=""SpareTire""></p>

<p>I was told that the spare is not the right size for my bike. I inflated it just a bit to see what it looked like in my tire and it does seem a bit small as it looks like it has a bit of room. <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/oWgYg.jpg"" alt=""Spare in 1""> <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/rQFk1.jpg"" alt=""Spare in 2"">.</p>

<p>I just got a spare tube that has a schrader valve and learned that those cannot fit through the hole in my wheel. I'm not sure but I think this is the type of tube I need to get <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002K2DQ4S"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.amazon.com/Avenir-Bicycle-Presta-25-35c-27-Inch/dp/B002K2DQ4S/ref=sr_1_10?s=cycling&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337452869&amp;sr=1-10</a> 700 x 35-45c or 700 x 25-35c as I was told I need 35 to be in the range of the second set of numbers. Is this correct? Can I get these with a presta valve in a store (like Target, Walmart, etc local large merchant) or should I just order and wait?</p>

<p>For additional info: My actual wheel says it is 622x17 6061H-T6. On the inside of the wheel groove it looks like it is stamped 900x16. It looks like the tire name and brand is Alexrims G6000. It is a hybrid bike.</p>
","<p>Any bike store, and probably any Walmart/Target/etc, will have what you need.</p>

<p>700C (or 650c, 26"", 29"", etc) is how big around the tube/wheel is, while the x23,28 or x30-42, etc are the width range. You want to find one that, as you mentioned, includes the target size within the range and is a match on size and valve type.</p>

<p>Based on the ""replacement"" not fitting, I'm thinking your wheel is a 700c/29"" and you are most likely looking for the right tube: 700x[range including 35] with a presta valve. That said, if you have a local bike shop, swing in there and the bike mechanic can make sure you are getting what you need. In most cases, the tube is going to cost the same (it's actually cheaper at the LBS I hang at as they buy tubes in bulk and sell them at close to cost) and you will be sure to get the right item.</p>

<p>Bonus: Ask the mechanic if he'd mind coaching you through changing out the tire. Someone who has changed a couple hundred tubes can usually give you pointers on how to roll the tire back on without tools, hot to prevent a pinch flat, and how to make the whole process quicker and easier.</p>

"How to repair sticky Ultegra shifter","24502","","<p>I have Ultegra 3x9 shifters and derailleurs that were installed just a couple months ago.  I purchased them on eBay and although they were new, they had been sitting in inventory for a couple years so not ""new"" in that sense.  New cabling was used when they were installed.</p>

<p>Today my rear shifter suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason.  When I attempt to shift up to a smaller cog, the entire brake lever moves with the trigger, so they basically cancel each other out.  I inspected the cables and derailleur and everything seems fine.  Shifting still works perfectly if I hold the brake lever so it doesn't move with the trigger, and downshifting to larger cogs works fine also.  This tells me it's probably the shifter itself, not cabling or derailleur.</p>

<p>Googling around I find many posts advising the use of WD-40 to free up a sticky shifter.  The idea is that the grease Shimano uses hardens with age and WD-40 will clean it out.  </p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this likely the problem?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, how do I re-lubricate the shifter after the WD-40?  To do it properly would require at least partially disassembling the shifter, which from what I've read and having seen the schematics, is something I really don't want to do.</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Well, I tried soaking it with WD40 and then re-lubing it with spray lithium grease.  No improvement whatsoever.  So I took it to the LBS, which declared it DOA.  They say they've seen this before with Shimano shifters.  Some internal part gets even slightly bent and the shifter fails completely.  And they're not really serviceable, so that means replace it.</p>

<p>This was a one-month old high-end shifter.  It was never damaged or misused.  Next bike will sport SRAM or Campy components.  They use half as many parts, work just as well, and can be field serviced.</p>

<p>So thanks for the answers.  </p>

<p>UPDATE: Contrary to what I'd been told about eBay purchases, Shimano honored the warranty and replaced the shifter.  I spoke to a customer service rep about it first because I was told I needed an RMA to return it, but that's not true either.  Simply fill out the warranty form available on their web site and ship the item to them with the completed form.</p>

"Cannot fit pump nozzle properly to the presta valve of my tyre","24222","","<p>I bought a Reebok Bike pump yesterday which is <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007S8R988/ref=asc_df_B007S8R98813201146?smid=A3JJAJ2Z3R1E47&amp;tag=hydra0b-21&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=22218&amp;creativeASIN=B007S8R988&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=114639824516295402&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt="" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>. I have presta valves for my Jamis Allegro Sport 2012 hybrid bike and I was trying to pump the tyres using the pump as part of my monthly maintenance. I could not lock the pump nozzle to my presta valve because the nozzle was not fitting properly even after locking the clamp and was constantly coming out. Additionally, I could not hard-press the nozzle as it might damage my presta valve. I would like to know what the problem is and if I (possibly) need an adapter to corretly fit the valve? Does anyone have any previous experience? I kind of feel that the pump itself is rubish</p>

<p>Also, When I connected the pump to the presta valve, it did not gauge the existing air pressure which is weird as I expected it to show so.</p>
","<p>First you need to make sure you have the right chuck setup.  If the pump you have is the one in the link then it claims to be auto-converting between Schrader and Presta -- you can skip to the next paragraph.  But if you have a slightly different pump it may require manual conversion.  As you press the chuck onto the valve you should feel some resistance as the rubber gasket in the chuck snugly fits around the valve stem.  If the fit is not snug the chuck probably requires manual conversion and is probably set up for Schrader, so you need to unscrew the knurled nut on the very end of the chuck and reverse the rubber gasket inside (taking care to no lose any spring or washer behind the gasket).  </p>

<p>Regardless of whether the chuck is auto-converting you may need to tighten the knurled nut on the open end of the chuck, to make it tight enough that you feel some resistance from the gasket as you slide the chuck on.</p>

<p>But before installing the chuck you must unscrew the little knurled knob on the top of the Presta valve.  Unscrew it all the way until it stops against the crimp on the top of the threaded rod.  Just to be sure you have it open, press the end of the rod with your finger and listen for the puff of air.</p>

<p>Press the chuck onto the valve.  If the Presta valve does not have a nut retaining it to keep it from sliding back into the tire you will likely need to use your thumb on the tire, on the back side of the valve, to keep the valve from sliding into the tire.</p>

<p>When you get the chuck all the way onto the valve (about 3/4"" or 2cm) then flip up the lever to lock the chuck on.  (Note that there have been a few chuck designs where you flip the lever up while applying/removing the chuck, and flip it down to latch instead of vice-versa.)</p>

<p>Once you get the chuck on properly you should be able to read the air pressure (if any) already in the tire.  If not the valve is not open and you will likely not be able to get air into the tire.</p>

<p>Once inflated, remove the chuck and screw the knurled knob down snug (but not over-tight).  And install the cap, if you have one.  This helps prevent damage to the relatively fragile Presta valve mechanism and prevents accidental release of air.</p>

<p>You need to add air to your tires much more often than monthly.  Once a week at the very least, and in most cases 2-3 times a week.</p>

"Why is the front brake lever on the right if you 'drive' on the left and vice-versa?","24138","","<p>I live in the UK and I expect my front brake lever to be operated by my right hand. However, I recently went on a friend's bike that had the brakes 'back to front', which would be the 'right way round' for people in Europe, North America and everywhere else that drives on the right.</p>

<p>I am left-handed and therefore used to finding things designed to be best operated with the right-hand, e.g. the controls on a lawnmower.</p>

<p>What are the reasons for the brake lever convention on a bicycle? It seems that the front brake is more important for controlled braking, in the UK we have that worked by the right hand, which makes sense. For countries that drive on the right that means the back brake has the 'handed-ness' advantage, rather than the front.</p>

<p>I also like to be controlling my speed with the front-brake when making a right-hand turn, however it is not possible to do this when signalling. A left turn is not so important to stick your arm out for - drivers coming the other way and behind don't really care if the sign is not made for a left-hand turn, whereas a right-hand turn really should be indicated. So, from that perspective, the brakes are the 'wrong-way-round' for me.</p>

<p>Can someone kindly guide me through why the brakes are wired up so and any historical origins of the convention?</p>
","<p>I believe the reason is that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_signals"">hand signals</a> used to indicate braking generally involve using your 'road side' hand. In countries that drive on the left, this is your right hand and vice versa.</p>

<p>The back brake was considered the 'safer' brake to use during this pre-braking time when you're indicating that you will brake but haven't necessarily started braking yet.</p>

"Do I really need to use primer first?","24107","","<p>It's my first time trying my hand at spray painting my bicycle. Do I really need to spray paint with primer first?</p>

<p>I've already dismantled and sandpapered the bike and was thinking of giving it two coats of matte black instead of Primer.</p>
","<p>I have extensive experience painting metal. Here are my rules of thumb. </p>

<ol>
<li>Rough up the metal, lots of nooks and crannies ensure the primer will stick. Sanding or sandblasting is the best way to do this. As pointed out in the comments, aluminium should be roughed up ""nicely"" :)</li>
<li>Clean the surface with some type of alcohol after you're done sanding. After you've cleaned it, wear gloves when handling the frame from now on. The oils on your hands can taint the paint job.</li>
<li>I always double coat the metal with primer because metal is prone to oxidization. Effect is diminished in aluminium, but can't be too careful. If your bicycle frame is aluminium, you'll need a special type of primer. Ask the guys at the hardware store or a car repair place what they recommend. </li>
<li>Single component paint works better on aluminium. </li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Primer is necessary for all types of metal </li>
<li>Special attention is needed for aluminium</li>
<li>The amount of effort you put into the paint job will show in the final product. Do it right once and your bike will look fine for years. </li>

"How do I stop my brake from sticking?","24023","","<p>The rear brake (calliper) on my road bike sticks. When I pull the brake it pulls down but only half springs back and there's then slack in the leavers.  This is causing rubbing on the rim.</p>

","<p>A few things off the top of my head:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not enough brake cable tension.  This is very likely if it's fairly new and hasn't been tuned up -- brake cables stretch over time, especially when new.  The amount of stretch can be more than the barrel adjuster can compensate for, so you would need to actually pull more cable through the cable clamp on the caliper.</p></li>
<li><p>Broken (or worn out) caliper spring.  Less likely, but you should be able to see if it's broken, depending on the model of brake.  Your LBS might also be able to replace the spring rather than buying a whole new caliper.</p></li>
<li><p>Frayed cable or housing causes cable to ""catch"" and not spring back.  Might be harder to find, you'll need to inspect the cables and housing for damage (may need to pull the cable out completely).  The good news is that these are relatively cheap &amp; easy to replace.</p></li>

","<p>Restoring the bike is a great way understand the bike.</p>

<p>My history is similar to yours. Gave up bikes around 10. Wife want to me ride with her.</p>

<p>I got a top of the line bike on CG for peanuts. of course, it was top of the line around the 90s :)</p>

<p><strong>cleaning</strong></p>

<p>start by REALLY cleaning the bike. simple green and brushes. don't be afraid to wet the bike. just avoid the seat if it's leather. and no water inside the tubes.</p>

<p><strong>shifters</strong> </p>

<p>I'd start replacing the shifters for indexed ones. getting the same brands will usually work. but will require a lot of research to match them with the rear derraileurs (the gear shifting thing on the back).</p>

<p>Another option is to just keep the ones you have (friction shifters) and feel the gears changing. Even with modern bikes, this is still the norm with the front gears, so no harm on going that route also. Plus, restoring and fine tunning the bike your self will make you 'know' how to feel the gears better.</p>

<p>UPDATE: i take that back. i kept my friction ones on my bike and rode the wife's bike with cheap indexed ones a few times. the friction are way better. also when the freewheel needed replacement i can get any number of gears i feel like and don't worry :). Indexed ones are better for changing on a whim. but are either freaking expensive or will require constant fiddling. friction are just install and forget. love them. unless you go expensive indexed. but i'm a cheap bastard.</p>

<p><strong>Wheels</strong></p>

<p>if it has Sealed bearings in the middle of the wheel you are fine. Those last a life time. It's that axle on each wheel. just turn them. if they keep rotating without ratling noises, you are fine. if they just turn a couple times after you roll them with your hand. you need new ones.</p>

<p>also, if they wooble when you turn them. they need truing. that's the only skill that does not pay off to learn your self.  $15 at a bike shop and the wooble is gone.</p>

<p>If they rattle, dont' spin, wooble. just get new wheels.</p>

<p><strong>cables</strong></p>

<p>inspect them all. pull them with your hand via each housing. if there's any drag. try to fix it (i did fix my rear derraileur cable by cutting one broken thread that was pointing outwards and so dragging in the housing. good as new now). If it's a brake cable, spew out the $7 and get a new one with new housings.</p>

<p>WD-40 into all cable paths also help.</p>

<p><strong>brakes</strong></p>

<p>Begin by checking that they still have plent of rubber.</p>

<p>Also check your wheel rims for damages.</p>

<p>you have to loose them and tighten them as close as possible to the rim. in a way that they are slightly curved against the wheel, with the BACK of the brake touching the wheel. the front of the brake is the front of the bike. it should look like: \ || /
you should be able to touch the rim with some &lt;15% of travel of the brake. the rest of the travel should be extra pressure for breaking power. Play around a lot with this. there's several places where you can adjust your brake.</p>

<p>Second step is to adjust them in a way that when you press the brakes, both sides touch the wheel at the same time! there's usually a screw on the side to control that.</p>

<p>make sure that NO other cable housing goes UNDER the front brakes cable. </p>

<p>And I can't stress this enough: test drive the bike on a straight run EVERY time you adjust them. mostly now that you are getting to know things.</p>

<p><strong>bearings</strong></p>

<p>bike has serviceable bearings in the cranks and in the freewheel (the thing that rotates the back wheel when you are not pedaling). usually your freewheel will be dry, cranks are almost always fine. check it by rotating the wheel and leaving the cranks still. if the chain is dragged to the front at slow rotating speeds, you have to grease/change the freehweel. I'd only change if the cogs are worn out.</p>

<p>you will need a spanner tool to open those.</p>

<p><strong>derraileurs</strong> </p>

<p>You will hear about them a lot. it's the pair of gears on the back that change the drive gear on the rear wheel, and the guide on the front that change the drive gear on the cranks.</p>

<p>It the easiest part to restore and adjust. If they do not move sideways when you press with your hands, open them up, clean, and grease the hell out of them. It's easy. was what took less time for me. but everyone will say the opposite.</p>

<p>when they are moving easily when you press them, read the parktool's article on how to adjust it. <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/rear-derailler-adjustments-derailleur"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/rear-derailler-adjustments-derailleur</a></p>

"Disassembling Shimano integrated gear shifters (brifters)","23916","","<p>The up-shift lever (the long one) on my gear shifter for the front derailleur got stuck and now I'm looking for a way to disassemble it. </p>

<p>Is there a way to do it without removing it from the handlebars? </p>
","<p>It took me 4 hours but I managed to disassemble the shifter and fix the problem. The cause was a broken spring inside the shifter. I replaced the spring, put it all back together and now its working fine.</p>

<p>Here's a rough description on how to disassemble the shifter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Release the brake cable</li>
<li>Release the gear cable</li>
<li>Stick a 5mm allen wrench under the rubber cover on the outside of the shifter. You'll find a screw there. Unscrew it and pull the shifter back to remove it</li>
<li>Remove the brake cable pivot pin inside the shifter</li>
<li>Pulling the brake will reveal the screws inside the shifter. Unscrew them one by one</li>
<li>At this point you should be able to remove the plastic housing</li>
<li>Unscrew the big screw at the center of the shifter (it is the screw that holds the whole cog/lever system together)</li>
<li>Don't make the same mistake as me and make sure to hold the shifter together while you undo the screw, otherwise the whole thing will explode into a lot of small cogs, springs etc on your floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>As other people here said, the hard part is putting it back together so try to do your best to memorize where each thing goes as you take them off one by one. Also try the method described by mattnz first, if it works you'll be saved a lot of hassle.</p>

<p>Hope this will be of some help to somebody.</p>

"How do I maximize my upper body workout from riding?","23913","","<p>I often hear people say “your bike is a whole-body gym”. I know my upper body workout will never be close to the workout my legs get, but so long as I’m a bike commuter, I figure I ought to get as much as I can out of it. I have a Trek 8.3DS, flat handlebars, no bullhorns, no upright grips.</p>

<p>How do I adjust my riding style/choice of bike/choice of equipment/types of rides to maximize whatever upper body exercise biking can give me?</p>
","<p>The ""pure"" answer to the question as asked is probably as others have said, climb as much as possible.  But perhaps a better answer is to admit that cycling is awesome for aerobic fitness and leg strength but not as great on the upper body.</p>

<p>Obviously, cross-training is an option, but even if you are 100% committed to your bike, you can probably get significant results from two common calisthenics pre and/or post ride: Push-ups and Pull-ups.  The key is that you want to develop your chest/shoulders/triceps (pushing) and your back/biceps (pulling), and doing multi-joint exercises is likely more efficient/helpful than isolation exercises.  If you can't do pull-ups and don't have access to a lat pulldown machine you can help yourself by using your legs to give yourself a gentle assist.  If you have or can scrounge some dumbbells you can do a bit more.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a set of 20-25 pushups, then 8-12 pull-ups, either just before or just after you put on your shorts/jersey.</li>
<li>Do a second set 5 minutes later after you've made up your water bottles, etc., put on your shoes, whatever.</li>
<li>Pump up your tires and get your bike ""ready,"" then do a third set.</li>
</ul>

<p>Go for a ride, and try to get in as much climbing as possible.  You'll probably be amazed at how quickly your strength will improve just with three sets of good form concentrated upper body calisthenics pre-ride.  Again, if you have dumbbells or a weight bench you could do bench presses/military presses, or laterals, and you could do rows to help with the ""pull,"" but the goal isn't really do to a full on weightlifting session, just some quick calisthenics with one effective push and one effective pull exercise and at least two, preferably three sets as you prep for your ride.</p>

"Touching the front wheel with my foot when turning","23899","","<p>My girlfriend got a new city bike today and she touches the front wheel every time she has to make a hard turn.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to avoid this besides replacing the whole bike?</p>

<p><strong>LATER EDIT:</strong>
I think I found my answer <a href=""http://forums.roadbikereview.com/general-cycling-discussion/toes-rub-front-wheel-264065.html"">here</a>.</p>
","<p>This is a common problem, but really not a big deal. I've usually heard it called ""toe overlap"". I have it on all my bikes.</p>

<p>Basically, it's a bit shocking the first time it happens, but <strong>you get used to it</strong>. It's no big deal. If you're simply aware that it can happen at slow speeds, you'll avoid it easily enough. Since it can only happen at slow speeds, it's not particularly dangerous.</p>

<p>It's most common on racing-style road bikes due to their short wheelbase or on smaller frame bikes. Big tires and/or fenders can make it more likely. Big feet and shoes that stick forward of your toes very far also make it more likely.</p>

<p>Possible solutions include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try not to worry about it. It's usually just an annoyance and you get used to it pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Don't go slow (can't turn the wheel far enough for it to be a problem unless you're going slow).</li>
<li>When going slow and making a sharp turn, pay attention to where your feet are.
<ul>
<li>Don't pedal while turning</li>
<li>Pump the pedals instead of normal pedaling, so that only your inside foot goes forward</li>
<li>Get your feet into a good position (outside foot just below where the pedal overlap happens) as you start to turn.</li>
<li>Also pay attention when starting from a stop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pedal with the ball of your foot over the spindle of the pedal. This is generally considered the ""correct"" place, and leaves your foot only going a little forward of the pedal. Some beginners put the arch of their foot on the pedal, which is likely to be uncomfortable on platform pedals, and puts your foot more forward.
<ul>
<li>Maybe slide your foot back a bit as you're making a slow turn, so that you pedal with your toes instead. I find this uncomfortable, but it's tolerable for a few seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you're shopping for bikes, look at how much toe overlap there is. You don't even need to ride the bike, you can tell by putting the pedal forward, putting a foot on the pedal at about the right position, and turning the handlebars.
<ul>
<li>Smaller riders may find that bikes with smaller wheels give them less toe overlap. 650b or 26"" instead of 700c?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Really, don't worry about it too much.</li>

"Does spin class prepare you for a long bike ride?","23807","","<p>I need to train for an upcoming bike ride and i wanted to see if attending a spin class 1-2 times a week (45 min course) would be appropriate way to prepare for a long bike ride (50 - 75 miles)</p>
","<p>Regular aerobic exercise is definitely of value for preparing for a big ride. Spin is a good preparation in conjunction with some outdoor rides, but it is not a substitute for riding your bike on the road. </p>

<p>The feel of the bike, the balance, the momentum, and the environmental and traffic factors will have an effect on your fitness as well, some of which may be purely mental.</p>

<p>At some point, with rim brakes, the rim wears through until it's no longer stable.</p>

<p>At some point the bearing races in the hub become too worn.</p>

<p>Of these, only the third reasonably demands that the wheel be replaced -- wheels with worn spokes can be relaced, and rims can be replaced without relacing.  But in some cases, especially if more than one of the above problems is looming, it may be more cost-effective to replace the wheel rather than repair it.</p>

"How to straighten a bent derailleur hanger?","23296","","<p>I've bent (again) my derailleur hanger. It's a replaceable hanger but for this summer I can't get an original one and I know that the non-original one I can get is made in a harder material and could possibly damage the frame.</p>

<p>So I'm left with the choice of straightening this light aluminium alloy thing. How do I do that without breaking/weakening it?</p>
","<p>Remove the derailleur and use an <a href=""http://www.drumsanders.net/adjustablewrench18in-pi-9342.html"">adjustable wrench</a> to bend it back into shape on the bike. That way you can see when it's straight more easily. Remember to check both vertical alignment and fore-aft alignment. With 5/6/7 speed doing this by eye will be fine. You might get good enough for 8 speed, but with 9 and 10 speed you'll have to be lucky to get reliable shifting using this method. Those setups are just too fussy.</p>

<p>Bike shops have a <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/product/derailleur-hanger-alignment-gauge-dag-2"">derailleur hanger alignment tool</a> that does this much more accurately by screwing into the derailleur mounting hole and letting you gauge position against the wheel rim. I've found that with 9 speed often a couple of millimetres at the rim can be the difference between smooth shifting and constant ""not quite in gear"" clicking in one or two gears.</p>

<p>Edit: this is a classic ""trivial with the right tools, impossible otherwise"" job on 9 and 10 speed systems. Put the bike in a mechanics workstand, attach the alignment tool, bend the hanger, reattach the derailleur, check the gears and it's done in 5 minutes. The bike shop will probably want to put in a new gear cable and housing for you (because otherwise if the shifting is less than perfect you might blame them rather than the friction in your old gear cable).</p>

<p>The fun part, BTW, is finding a replacement hanger if the bike manufacturer no longer stocks them. There are ""clone"" manufacturers but the catalog of available hangers is huge (often one bike model has different hangers in different years, so unless you know exactly which frame you have the label on the frame might not help much).</p>

"How to tighten a brake?","23294","","<p><em>This is probably a really basic question but I'm confused by the whole brake mechanism so...</em></p>

<p>My left (front wheel) brake has to be pulled in really far before it actually starts to brake (I guess before the brake pads touch the wheel). What do I do to tighten it up? (diagrams would really help, I think)</p>
","<p>There are two basic adjustments that apply to all types of rim brakes (v-brakes, cantilevers, calipers):</p>

<p><strong>Tension:</strong>
The cable tension from the brake lever to the brakes adjusts how responsive your brakes feel.  Tighten it up and both brake pads will engage sooner and the braking action will be harder.  Loosen it up and braking will feel spongy and you may not get enough power.  Normally you want to add tension; removing tension is only done when you put on fresh pads or if you set the tension too tight.  Adding tension periodically is important since your pads wear down over time and the cable stretches a bit too.</p>

<p>The easiest way to adjust the tension is to use a barrel adjuster: they're usually on the brake lever or the brake or both if you're lucky.  Add tension by turning the adjuster counter-clockwise (looking at it from the side where the cable housing goes in).</p>

<p>But whenever you adjust tension, you need to fix...</p>

<p><strong>Balance:</strong>
This controls how far each pad is from the rim.  Adding tension will pull both pads closer to the rim, but usually one will move more than the other.  So by adjusting balance you can move the closer one further away and the other pad will do the opposite.  You want to balance the pads so that they're about the same distance from the rim and engage at about the same time.  If it's skewed (like your brakes) then you won't get as much braking power.</p>

<p>For v-brakes and canti's there's a spring inside each brake arm.  You can adjust the spring force by turning a small set screw on the side of the brake arm.  Screwing it in (clockwise) will pull the arm away from the rim (which pulls the other one closer).  It's best to adjust the two arms together:  screw in the closer arm first by half a turn to start, and screw out the other one by the same amount.  Check the balance and then repeat as necessary.</p>

<p>For caliper brakes (road bikes) there's normally just one set screw to adjust.  Turn it to see which way the brakes move.</p>

"Chain slipping off derailleur jockey","22806","","<p>Last week, I had to abandon a training ride due to my chain slipping off my rear derailleur jockey wheel. This would only happen when shifting, and most often when either shifting chainrings or shifting multiple cogs in one go. I took the bike in to my LBS, and they diagnosed it as a bent derailleur hanger — a reasonable guess, given I took a spill in a crit the previous week (although, curiously, I did not have any problems in the race between my wreck and the training ride). They bent the hanger back into place and sent me on my way.</p>

<p>Tonight, on my first ride after the fix, the problem was happening again. Same deal, but less frequent. Shifting multiple cogs, especially right before/after a chainring shift would reproduce the problem with a high probability. After getting home, I put my bike in my stand and checked the alignment with a derailleur alignment gauge. It's absolutely perfect. And yet a little shifting while in the stand and I was able to easily reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>To recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>chain slips off bottom derailleur jockey wheel</li>
<li>perfect derailleur hanger alignment</li>
<li>only during ""significant"" shifts</li>
<li>not limited to shifting under load</li>
<li>SRAM Force components</li>
</ul>

<p>Pics are below. Any ideas? If more pictures are necessary in order to diagnose the problem, I'll be happy to provide.</p>

<p>Edit: After discussion in the comments, the problem is almost certainly that the derailleur cage is twisted and misaligned. Time for a new derailleur.</p>

","<p>This type of problem has 5 likely causes, listed in order of elimination. </p>

<ol>
<li>Bent dérailleur hanger, or <strong>Bent derailleur cage</strong>. (Your derailleur hanger looks straight, but the cage appears slightly twisted in the upper photo. Could be the angle of the shot, though.) <strong>Edit: This turned out to be the correct answer, after all.</strong></li>
<li>Bent, twisted, or sticky chain link. </li>
<li>Badly worn dérailleur pulley wheels. This means there is not enough tooth left to hold the chain on the pulley wheel. (In my opinion this is most likely, but I'd need a photo of the derailleur side on to confirm.)</li>
<li>Worn chain. A badly worn chain will slip off the pulleys in this manner, sometimes. Usually, you would also experience slow and noisy shifting in the rear gears. </li>
<li>Worn cassette. Usually, you would also experience slow and noisy shifting in the rear gears, not just the pulley derailment, and usually it would be preceded by a worn chain. But it is possible, especially if the chain has recently been changed. </li>
</ol>

<p>You've checked the derailleur hanger, so #1 is less likely. Although I would look at the derailleur cage or body. It really does appear bent in the second photo, unless the derailment is putting outside pressure on it.</p>

<p>You would see and feel #2 on the repair stand, so I assume that is unlikely, although it's easy to check and eliminate.</p>

<p>'#3 is my guess, without a side photo to confirm it. This is a photo of the difference between worn and unworn pulleys. Keep in mind, this is an extreme difference, and yours don't need to look this bad to cause your problem. <strong>Edit: After new photos, there is some wear, but not enough to cause the issue.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iYzUt.jpg"" alt=""Worn derailleur pulleys""></p>

<p>A worn chain is easy to check. Use the Park tool gauge or a similar tool to measure the wear. On that gauge, to see this issue, I would expect close to 1mm of wear.</p>

<p>A worn cassette is usually preceded by a worn chain, so if your chain is badly worn, you may need to change the cassette as well. Worst case, you may need new chain rings as well, but that is less likely.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to include troubleshooting steps and conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>After talking through the issue with Stephen, and looking at new and more direct photos, it is clear that the derailleur cage or body is misaligned, as discussed in option #1. </p>

<p>There is pulley wear as discussed in option #3, but not to a major degree. </p>

<p>You can follow the logic in the comments below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Derailleur hanger is confirmed straight by my own DAG. Cage might be twisted. I'll check, and upload a pic with a dead-on shot. It's carbon fiber, though — will CF bend? No sticky chain links. I'll put a new chain on to rule out #2 and #4, though. How would a worn cassette cause the issue, given that this is happening before the chain enters the cassette? – Stephen Touset 42 mins ago</li>
<li>A worn cassette can cause the chain to be out of line with the derailleur slightly. It's less likely, but possible. That's why it's at the end of the list. – zenbike♦ 34 mins ago</li>
<li>A CF derailleur cage isn't likely bent, but the derailleur body might be. In the photo, it looks twisted to the outside, so check whether the pulleys run parallel to the cogs when there is no chain on it. Only your outer plate in carbon.If the inner plate is bent or twisted, the CF plate has enough give to move with it. – zenbike♦ 32 mins ago</li>
<li>More pics uploaded. In the rear pic, the chain on the bottom derailleur looks a bit to the right, but this seems to be that the chain is just pushed all the way to one side of the teeth. There is about +/- 3˚–5˚ of play in the jockeys. Normal? – Stephen Touset 21 mins ago</li>
<li>Actually, the play is normal, especially in th upper pulley. But that derailleur cage is not aligned correctly. The cog of the gear it's in, and both pulleys should make a straight line, as perfectly vertical as possible. In that photo, ignoring the chain, the upper pulley is twisted slightly toward the frame, and the lower is even farther out of line. It is still possible that it is the angle of the photo, but it doesn't appear to be. You're also showing wear on the derailleur pulleys, if not nearly as bad as in the photo I posted. I'd say it's time for a new rear dérailleur. The cage itself should be parallel to the cogs, and that isn't the case either. – zenbike♦ 13 mins ago</li>
<li>One question: Have you recently disassembled the derailleur? Is there more float side to side in the lower pulley than in the upper? – zenbike♦ 8 mins ago</li>
<li>No to disassembly. Much more float in the upper pulley than the lower. Looks like you're right with the alignment. New derailleur time. Anything I can do in the meantime to minimize the chance of problems this weekend? As in, what should I try and bend to correct the misalignment as best I can? – Stephen Touset 8 mins ago</li>
<li>Ok. Well, you can try to bend the cage back in to alignment. If you take the photo you posted last, and lay a ruler through the cogs, it should pass through the points of the teeth of both pulleys. That's the goal. If its the derailleur body, trying to bend it back may make it worse, but given the problems you have, I'd try. Worst case, hit your LBS for a new one before the race. – zenbike♦ 3 mins ago</li>
<li>Thanks a bunch. If you'll edit your answer to include the latest conclusions, I'll be glad to accept. – Stephen Touset 1 min ago</li>

"What are the disadvantages of ""puncture proof"" (or puncture resistant) tires?","22789","","<p>Some people refer to tires that are more resistant to punctures as ""puncture proof"" tires.
For example: <a href=""http://www.evanscycles.com/products/specialized/all-condition-armadillo-tyre-ec001821?utm_source=awin&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=awin&amp;promo=Communities"">Specialized All Condition Armadillo Tyre</a></p>

<p>Even though these tires are not really puncture proof, they do reduce a lot the chances of puncturing. So the advantage is obvious.</p>

<p>Apparently, they're not too expensive compared to regular tires. So, I was wondering why people would choose not to use these more resistant tires. What are their disadvantages?</p>
","<p>Though there no doubt are ""puncture-resistant"" tires that seek to accomplish that end by means of extra-thick rubber, for the past 15-20 years the standard for puncture resistance has been Kevlar belted tires, which look and ride like ordinary tires and weight essentially the same as ordinary tires (maybe a few grams more). </p>

<p>The Kevlar belt under the tread increases puncture resistance by at least a factor 10, eliminating most common glass/thorn punctures, and also reducing the tendency of the tire to ""bruise"".</p>

<p>Price wise, my recollection is that they are about 30% more expensive than standard tires, but they likely last that much longer (plus save a lot on tubes), so the cost is pretty much a wash.  (The odd thing is that Kevlar-belted tires are so hard to find.)</p>

<p>Some people apparently confuse ""Kevlar belted"" tires with ""Kevlar bead"" tires.  The latter are ""folding"" tires and are supposedly desired because they are a hair lighter than metal bead tires, plus they can be folded and stuffed in a pannier.  But you can buy Kevlar belted with a metal bead (my preference, since folding tires are a PITA to install), and Kevlar bead tires are not necessarily Kevlar belted (in fact, most often not).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Last Saturday I had my first puncture in maybe 5 years (maybe 2000 miles), while finishing up a 35-mile morning.  Just got around to fixing it because it's been ungodly hot and humid. (Hitched a ride home the last two miles, since there was no way to fix the flat in 95-degree weather on a 4-foot shoulder in the sun with traffic whizzing by at 70 MPH.)</p>

<p>The culprit was apparently a construction staple that had pierced the tire just outside the belt, gone through the sidewall of the tube, and then punched a bigger hole in the inside diameter of the tube.</p>

<p>I do notice the tire is wearing a bit thin, so I'll probably have to replace it within a year or so.  I'm dreading trying to find a 700/35c road tire with Kevlar belt, though -- the catalogs are now full of off-road tires and cater even less to the touring market than they did 5-10 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>OK</strong> -- To make this into a direct answer to the question, the main disadvantage of Kevlar belted tires is that you forget how to change a tire, you do it so rarely.</p>

","<p>If you have horizontal dropouts (the wheel axle slides into the frame from the back of the bike) the dropouts have long slots which will allow you to pull the rear wheel back and take slack from the chain.  Be careful to ensure when you torque the wheel nuts down the wheel doesn't slip from being aligned straight, or the chain is running at a slight angle.</p>

<p>If the chain is so stretched to the point where it's falling off, you really should consider replacing the chain.  You can get away with removing a link to remove the slack but a worn chain will be prone to sticky links and popping off unannounced.</p>

<li><p>When would you want to change the tightness of the pedals? Based on terrain? Riding? etc? Do you ever really adjust them?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Two guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you're unclipping unexpectedly (happens most often when pulling up) then increase the tension.  That means turning the adjustment bolt clockwise to increase the spring tension.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble clipping in/out then loosen the tension until you can easily clip in/out when you need to.  Turn the adjustment bolt counter-clockwise to relax the spring.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're not having either problem, then no need to adjust at all.  If you're having both, then you'll need to choose which is more important (probably clipping in/out) and adjust for that.</p>

<p>Cassettes don't screw on unless you are using a free wheel, they have splines and a lock ring.  Yes, there are some differences.  Most likely it is Shimano Hyperglide, the wheel manufacturer will probably state this.  Sometimes, they don't though, which makes it fun.</p>

<p>The bike should contain the major quality of several specifically designed bikes. By this I mean the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Road Bikes:</strong> Lightweight, speed, ergonomic</li>
<li><strong>Downhill MTBs:</strong> Rigid Frame, High performance suspension and Tires</li>
<li><strong>Cross Country:</strong> Comfortable (on <em>Long tours</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p>For me, I have an habit of using a MTB for most of all the activities I mentioned above and most of time, this is not an comfortable experience over long run.</p>

<p>So, the question is simple <strong><em>Is there a bike, which contains all the qualities in one?</em></strong></p>
","<p>In general you can get an very good all-around road bike, or a very good all-around mountain bike.  To get a single bike for everything there will always be trade-offs in areas like weight/durability; speed/traction; etc.</p>

<p>That said - many people own one bike and use it for everything.  If I had to drop to one bike I would buy a 29""-wheel based front suspension mountain bike with the following:</p>

<li>suspension front fork with lockout</li>
<li>disk brakes </li>
<li>rack and fender mounts (and a rack and fenders)</li>

<p>From the Park Tool Website:</p>

<p>Some chain manufacturers offer a ""master-link"" to join the chain. Be sure to read the manufacturers directions. Typically, the bicycle chain ends must have inner plates on each end. In other words, neither chain end has an outer plate with a rivet. The link comes in two pieces.

<p>.</p>

<p>Install one piece through inside face of chain, and install second piece through outside of the other chain end. Engage the two pieces so link rivet mates to link plate hole. Pull chain to lock the link. The best method to do this is to move master link to top section between rear cogs and front chainrings and press hard on pedals. This insures the link is fully locked. Inspect link before riding the chain.

"What are my options for replacing/upgrading my MTB front mech?","22153","","<p>I recently damaged my front mech, a Shimano Acera, top swing, bottom pull, triple chainring. The rear cassette is 8-speed. So I need to replace this front mech.</p>

<p>The original Shimano Acera is probably circa 2002 so I will likely not get a direct replacement, and in any case it was a bit cheap and nasty and I'd rather go with something a bit more ""beefy"". I'm thinking of something like Deore XT, but I can't find a model that says it is compatible with a 3x8 drive train.</p>

<p>The options are a bit bewildering. Can someone suggest a part?</p>
","<p>Rear derailleurs don't care whats up in front and vice versa. Rear derailleurs don't care about the number of cogs in the back, but front derailleurs care about the number of chain rings (you can get a triple derailleur to play nice with a double chainring, but you should probably get the right part to begin with). </p>

<p>Speeds are mostly <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/speeds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">marketing</a> though, as higher speed chains are narrower than lower speed chains (the only times speeds matter are in chain selection (too little speeds and the chain may be too fat), cassette (duh) and if you're using indexed shifters the shifters need to be matched to the speeds (and the appropriate cable pulls of the derailleurs)) - everywhere else, if the chain fits, it should work. For example, if you put an 8 speed chain in a FD designed for a 10 speed derailleur, it will probably rub but if you put a 9 speed chain in an 8 speed system, everything should be fine. However, using a ""9 speed"" front derailleur with an 8 speed system is fine (a 7 or 8 speed FD would work fine too). The only thing that matters is how much cable the shifters need to pull, and where the derailleur is mounted (top pull, etc.).</p>

<p>Things you need to check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cable pull (In this case, you need a Shimano mountain front derailleur, not a road FD (else, index shifting won't work). Also, top pull (though your derailleur will probably be dual pull - this is dependent how the frame was designed to pull the cable). )</li>
<li>Double or Triple compatibility (In this case, triple - the cages are shaped differently)</li>
<li>Size of largest chain ring, and gaps in sizes to other chain rings (The cages are shaped to clear the largest chain ring, so if its too big or small, the cage won't position properly for good shifting. If the gaps are too big, you'll have trouble shifting between them (If you didn't customize your chainrings, chances are you're fine).)</li>
<li>Mounting (Diameter of seat tube mounting point or if you have another type of mount, that. Also, top swing. If you can't mount it, you can't use it. )</li>
<li>Chain slope (Chainstay angle - If you have the wrong one, the chain might hit the cage no matter how you adjust it.)</li>
</ul>

<p>All these things are specified in the data sheet for the derailleur models. </p>

<p>Typically, you don't need to be spendy on the front derailleur (especially if you were running acera before) - I doubt you'd gain anything from doing so, other than something slightly prettier and a bit lighter of a wallet. Chances are that getting the FD set up properly (good cable routing, cables in good condition, positioning and adjustments done properly) even if its a cheap one (which I do suggest, the Shimano Tourney) is a better spend of money than just slapping an expensive FD like a Deore one on.</p>

<p>A cheap option is a <a href=""http://techdocs.shimano.com/techdocs/blevel.jsp?ASSORTMENT%3C%3East_id=1408474395181679&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302051870"" rel=""nofollow"">Shimano Tourney</a> front derailleur. This is what I'd probably go for provided your crankset is within spec, but you can choose any ""7 speed"", ""8 speed"" or ""9 speed"" Shimano mountain bike derailleur which is top swing, dual/bottom pull which fits the appropriate criteria above. You can probably run into your LBS and get them to give you the right Tourney FD for under 15 dollars. They may have a 7, 8 or 9 speed Alivio/Acera one laying around at the same price as well, so you could grab that instead. </p>

"What is the maximum weight that ""normal"" racing wheels can withstand?","22083","","<p>I was recently in a bike-shop where the proprietor told me that the ""normal"" racing wheels of the more advanced bikes are normally only rated to carry 85kg. For example, he mentioned the Bianchi Maddux RX 5.1 as being unsuitable for a 95+kg person… you could ride on them, but within six months you would be unhappy.</p>

<p>I have never heard this before, and while it is obvious that the wheels will have a designed weight limit, I find 85kg really light.</p>

<p>I am over 6'4"", so getting to 85kg renders me as a stick insect, and is unlikely to happen… So I would like to know whether I really need to splash out the extra to get custom made 36 spoke wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I ended up getting myself a pair of <a href=""http://www.mavic.com/en/product/wheels/road-triathlon/wheels/Ksyrium-SR"">Mavic Ksyrium SR</a> wheels. The general reviews seem to have them as being fairly strong...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Having ridden these wheels for a few thousand kms, I can say that they really are strong. I just had a front-on accident where the bike frame had the top pipe literally snapped , and the front wheel is only slightly off true, and with a relatively small dent... still enough to write the wheel off, but I was extraordinarily impressed!</p>
","<p>As a sometime wheelbuilder, I'd say yes. Lightweight wheels definitely come with weight limits and you should respect them. It should be in the manual for the wheel, and ideally on the spec sheet as well.</p>

<p>That's not to say you need to obey them, just be aware that when you don't you're much more likely to have problems. But for a race where they matter, it can be worth it. You're likely to get away with them for flat time trial when a steep climb or criterium will see them fail in the first race. But for the TT, those wheels might shave the critical 5s off your time.</p>

<p>It's not just your weight on the saddle that matters. You're also stronger than a lighter rider, and more likely to have a huge amount of explosive power. Those are the things that actually cause wheels to fail because that's when you're side loading the wheel. Throwing the bike around in a sprint is especially bad because you're throwing your weight sideways at the bike on the down stroke.</p>

<p>I've had customers who can't even get a reasonable life out of standard 36 spoke wheels. All it takes is a 100kg guy who races criteriums or rides to work and likes jumping out of the lights, and their wheels start failing after a few Mm. The tricky ones are the 120kg+ riders who are overweight and are riding to lose it. Often we see them only after their first bike has fallen apart under them (and it's a combination of being heavy and poor technique - they don't lift off the saddle on bumps, so the rear wheel takes the full impact of every lip and pothole). Having to explain that no stock wheel will work can be hard - instead of a $500 bike they're going to need a heavy $600 steel MTB with $300 of custom wheels.</p>

<p>I usually set my rear (red) light to blink, because I believe it makes me more visible at night. My friend argues that it makes it more difficult for motorists to judge how far away I am.</p>

<p>Are there any studies showing which is the safer way to use a tail light?</p>
","<p>The short answer is that 'safer' is subjective and depends on your requirements.</p>

<p>You are both correct.  Movement attracts the eye, so your blinking light is noticed.  It is easier to judge the position of a steady state light.</p>

<p>For a motorist to pick out your tail light, particularly, from a sea of noise is very difficult.  The surface area of the light is tiny, and it's all on its own.  Your light is just not important enough to notice amongst the jumble of signs, traffic directions and other cars unless it does something to stand out, like flash.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the reason it's easy to see cars (apart from bulk) is that they have 2 lights moving together.  Something to do with your brain automagically resolving the connected pattern.  That's why it's hard to see a car with one working taillight, or a motorcycle or bicycle.</p>

<p>In terms of safety, my policy is always 'be seen and misjudged' rather than 'not seen'. So I always set both front and rear lights to blink at night.  If you need illumination for the road, I'd strongly suggest a second forward light for that.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/resources/pdf/iesna01a.pdf"">Rear Lighting Configurations for Winter Maintenance Vehicles</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flashing lights will be perceived as having higher brightness than steady-burning lights, up to a flash frequency of about 15 flashes per second. Such brightness enhancement can aid in conspicuity, and several rear lighting systems have been designed to have a flash rate between 5 and 9 flashes per second in order to maximize their perceived brightness. While conspicuity may be greater with such configurations, an observer’s ability to make accurate judgements of relative speed or distance may be compromised when flashing or strobing lights are used. Croft observed that the judgments required in tracking an object were difficult to make under strobing conditions, yet very easy in steady-lighting conditions. Observations made during a study of service vehicle lighting for maintenance operations similarly pointed out that strobing and flashing systems designed for maximum conspicuity can at the same time reduce one's ability to judge relative speed and distance. Periodic sampling of the field of view in another study resulted in deterioration of one's motion-tracking ability that increased as the distance to the object of interest decreased.</p>

","<p>18km a day is not far, as long as you have an OK fitness level to start with and no health issues, it is certainly achievable, but...  </p>

<p>You will not get any rest days. I was once told, you do not get fit exercising, you get fit recovering. If you ride 5 days a week, there's no recovery time. This could lead to problems since each day's effort is stressing your body. For the beginning I would strongly recommend not more than 3 days (with a day between) until you are sure you can comfortably do five days every week. </p>

<p>What I would suggest you to do is first thing in the morning measure your resting pulse rate. Do this for 3 or 4 mornings to establish a baseline. Start riding, taking it easy to begin with (for the first couple of weeks). Note how you feel and your resting pulse rate - if you feel bad and your pulse is higher than it should be, have a rest day or two. (Note - normally your resting pulse rate will fall as you get fitter, so your baseline will change.)</p>

"What are the advantages of angling your saddle down?","21688","","<p>I have seen a few people do this where their saddle was angled down a bit. Why would someone do that?</p>
","<p>In general, I don't know why one would do this. Especially men.</p>

<p>Here's what <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/saddles.html#angle"">Sheldon Brown</a> has to say, and I tend to agree:
""If the saddle is tilted down in front, the rider will tend to slide forward onto the narrower part of the saddle. Women who are riding on saddles that were designed for men frequently tilt their saddles down. This will relieve some of the discomfort from the saddle itself, but creates new problems: The downward slope of the saddle causes the rider to tend to slide forward, and this can only be counteracted by pressure on the hands. Thus, poorly-angled saddles often are the cause of wrist, shoulder and neck problems, due to carrying too much of the rider's weight on the hands.""</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.zinncycles.com/book_and_dvd.php"">Lennard Zinn</a> mentions that a ""very slight"" tilt in either direction may be optimal for some riders; but no more than ~2 degrees. Basically the same reasons that Sheldon Brown mentions. The downward forward tilt adds pressure on the arms, back, and shoulders due to sliding forward. </p>

<p>You want your ""sit bones"" to be on the widest part of the saddle. If you slide forward, the pressure will shift from the sit bones to the perineum; and that's probably a bad thing. There are special cases for tilting the saddle nose downward; but for the general rider it's not necessary. </p>

","<p>Answer: <strong>No</strong> you don't need a new hub. </p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, you will probably need to put a small (~1mm) spacer at the back of the cassette, otherwise you won't be able to tighten the whole cassette down. Also be aware that prolonged use of a 10-speed cassette on an 8/9-speed freehub body will cause dents to form in the freehub body (because the 10-speed cogs are so narrow). The 10-speed freehub bodies have taller splines, so they avoid this problem (but don't work with 8- or 9-speed cassettes). </p>

"How do I calculate the power required to climb a hill at a given cadence? ","21565","","<p>Suppose I ride at a cadence of 50RPM for 10 minutes with a 39x23 gear ratio on a hill with 10% grade. Is there a simple formula to calculate the power output required?</p>
","<p>You don't quite supply enough information in your specific question (that is, ""50RPM for 10 minutes with 39x23 with 10% hill"") to provide a full answer in absolute terms but, if we assume you're riding a standard sized 700c bike there's enough information to make a good estimate in relative terms.</p>

<p>First I'll give a short answer, then a rule of thumb that's easy to calculate and will put you within about 10%, then a longer more detailed answer. </p>

<p>The short answer to your question, in relative terms, is ~ 3 watts/kg of total mass. To convert that to total absolute watts, you just multiply 3 watts/kg * total mass (in kg) for you, your bike, and all the equipment you're carrying. For example, if you weigh 70 kg and your bike and all its equipment together weigh an additional 10 kg, it will take approximately 3 * (70+10) = 240 watts. If you weigh 70 kg, that would mean you would need to produce 240/70 = ~ 3.4 watts/kg of body mass.  To put that into context, 3.4 watts/kg for 10 minutes is not a bad amount of power output for a casual recreational cyclist; on a normal walk on flat level ground people average around 1 watt/kg, while a pro cyclist might be able to average in excess of 5 watts/kg for an hour. It has been estimated that Lance Armstrong produced slightly over 6 watts/kg for 40 minutes in climbing Alpe d'Huez during the Tour de France. </p>

<p>A rule of thumb to use to convert speed to power on steep hills is this: On a steep hill, multiply the hill's gradient by your speed in km/h, then by ~ 3. If you measure your speed in mph, multiply by 5 rather than 3. That will give you a ballpark estimate of the watts/kg you need to produce. For example, if you are climbing a 10% hill in a 39/23 gear ratio at 50 rpm on a standard sized bike, you're traveling at ~ 11 km/h (or around 6.5 mph). So 10% * 11 km/h = 1.1, and 1.1 * 3 = 3.3 watts/kg. Alternatively, if you measure speed in mph, 10% * 6.5 mph = .65, and .65 * 5 = 3.25 watts/kg. Basically, all you have to remember for this rule of thumb is the number 3 if you measure speed in km/h, or 5 if you measure speed in mph. </p>

<p>How did I convert your cadence in a particular gear to speed? On a standard normal-sized bike, the ""700c"" rear wheel has a circumference ~ 2100mm (= ~ 2.1 meters). If you were pedaling at 50 rpm through a 39/23 gear, then (50 rpm) * (39/23) * (60 minutes/hour) * (2.1 meters) = ~ 10700 meters/hour, or 10.7 km/h, or 6.6 mph.</p>

<p>And now, the fuller explanation. The equation to convert speed to power is well-understood. Total power demanded has four parts:</p>

<pre><code>Total power = power needed to overcome rolling resistance + 
              power needed to overcome aerodynamic resistance + 
              power needed to overcome changes in speed (kinetic energy) + 
              power needed to overcome changes in elevation (potential energy)
</code></pre>

<p>Of these, the simplest piece is the power needed to overcome changes in elevation which, fortunately in this case, is what you were asking. On a steep hill, your speed is low and the aerodynamic and other resistance forces tend to be small relative to the climbing part. The power needed to account for the change in potential energy is straightforward: </p>

<p>watts(PE) = slope * speed in meters/sec * total mass * 9.8 m/sec^2</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>watts/kg = slope * speed in meters/sec * 9.8 m/sec^2</p>

<p>So, all we need is to get speed in m/s. If you have a cyclecomputer that reads in km/h, you need to divide km/h by 3.6 to get m/s and multiply by 9.8. If your cyclecomputer reads in mph, divide mph by 2.25 and multiply by 9.8. If you do this, you'll see that the resulting constants are approximately 3 (for km/h) and 5 (for mph), as stated in the rule of thumb above. </p>

"Why can't Yellow Jersey change hands on last day of Tour De France?","21557","","<p>I've often read / seen on TV that the race is won by the end of the penultimate day. For example, <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jul/23/cadel-evans-tour-de-france-champion-elect"">this article</a> in the Guardian describes this year's (2011) eventual winner as the champion elect in an article on the close of the penultimate day. The final day seems to be left to the sprinters.   </p>

<p>Why is this? Surely if the top two riders are very close the guy in second place can go for it.</p>
","<p>Tradition, and the layout of the final stage. </p>

<p>Tradition holds that the last stage is a victory parade for the GC contender, and the yellow jersey. Cadel Evans rode a good part of the 2011 final stage, once in Paris, with champagne in hand.</p>

<p>In addition, the layout of the stage, a 95 km flat ride finishing with multiple laps around the Champs Elysees, and culminating in a bunch sprint, rarely allows the opportunity for any major time to be gained. So unless they are within seconds, as in the 1989 Greg Lemond win by 8 seconds over Laurent Fignon, the last stage will rarely play a part in the GC standings. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGuvP.gif"" alt=""Champs Elysees Stage Profile""></p>

<p>As is stated in the description of the stage on the letour.fr page today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every other time, it has been a road stage that has been decided in a bunch sprint, except on four occasions. Those exceptions were the victories taken by Alain Meslet in 1977, Bernard Hinault in 1979, Eddy Seigneur in 1994 and Alexandre Vinokourov in 2005. It is incredibly hard to get a telling gap on this stage when breakaway riders are always within sight of the peloton.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you know that a breakaway will not gain you minutes, why risk the ire of the other riders, and your public by messing with the traditions of the race?</p>

<p>One of the things that has always brought an audience back to this race above all others are the traditions of fair play and honorable conduct that are embodied by traditions like the one that allows a crashed race leader to regain his time by the other riders, before the race continues. These unwritten traditions are not rules, but they make this race special.</p>

<p>Combine the two, and you will rarely see a major change on the last day. It can, and does happen. Just not often.</p>

"What is the trick to riding on sand?","21472","","<p>I have been trying to ride on some trials that have very soft sand and especially agitated by ATVs.  When I hit a soft patch my front tire pulls in one direction and I freak out a little.  I cannot seem to plow through it and ultimately just end up moving slower and slower, which than leads to a full stop.</p>

<p>Is there some trick or style to riding on these trails?</p>
","<p>Yes there is one main trick, and some regular skills.</p>

<p>The trick is: if you LOWER THE TIRE PRESSURE, any tire will float over sand like magic. It should not be so underinflated as to allow easy pinch flats, but the lower the pressure, the more marked the floating effect. There are just two limitations:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the tire is skinny (low volume) it might not be possible to have a pressure level that allows flotation AND safe riding over rough terrain on other trail sections;</li>
<li>It's not possible to adjust tire pressure ""on the fly"" ;o)  But if you know you're having a long stretch of soft terrain, it's possible to have a good trade-off.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, huge tires (2.3 +) are perfect for that (watch this <a href=""http://youtu.be/LRb2hNo6drQ"">Surly Pugsley</a> video). Also, knobby doesn't help that much, sometimes slicks are better; they cause less shearing of the sand and rob you of less kinetic energy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now the skills are mostly help maintain speed and direction.</p>

<p>Speed: not so fast as to suddenly throw you over the bars in case of loss of control, not so slow that your rear wheel loses traction in order to maintain or recover speed.</p>

<p>Direction: plan ahead the smoothest possible trajectory, and point your front wheel firmly along that trajectory. Avoid wobbling on the pedals, major gear changes, and specially avoid sharp turns, because there is a critical steering angle above which the front tire skids sideways and the bike becomes unstable, making it almost impossible to regain control in some cases (of course the more skill one has, the more one can recover from).</p>

<p>Hope that helps and... PRACTICE! Few things can be more fun than that!</p>

"What are my options for cycling mirrors?","21277","","<p>What options are available in terms of types of cycling mirrors? Where all can I mount them and what are the advantages and disadvantages to each?</p>
","<p>Bicycle mirrors are going fall into two basic categories- the type that you mount somewhere on your bike and the type that you mount somewhere on your head. Both categories have their pros and cons, but many of them are subjective. A pro to one individual may be considered a con to the next. Within those two categories you have a variety of different options to choose from. Here's the breakdown of those that I am aware of.
<br/><br/><br/></p>

<h1>On your head</h1>

<p>One thing to keep in mind with head mounted options is that they are always in your field of vision. You may consider this a pro, or you may consider it a con. On one hand you dont have to look off of your course of travel by much to view the mirror, on the other hand it can be distracting to always have it in your field of vision and can be awkward to focus on. Head mounted mirrors always look directly behind where your head is pointed. That means that they're not always pointed opposite your direction of travel, ie the road and traffic behind you. Depending on how far away from your head the mirror is, it can be difficult to get the mirror adjusted in such a way that your head does not obstruct your rear view or to where you are not looking off to an extreme angle to view the mirror. Mounting can be finicky. On the plus side they tend to be very light weight and tend to stay adjusted for the duration of your ride, and they are generally less obstructive than most bike mounted mirrors. Your options for head mounted mirrors are:</p>

<h3>Helmet mount</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yNsh5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
Helmet mounted mirror are typically affixed with an adhesive pad or with a clamp to the front-side of your helmet. Typically they will stick out a little further than other head mounted mirrors, which is a good thing. It allows you to more easily see around your own head and you do not have to look off to as extreme of an angle. For adhesive type mounts the downsides are that the adhesive mounting point is (or is supposed to be) permanent and can potentially damage the helmet if removed. For some helmets it can be difficult to find an adequately flat surface to attach the adhesive pad to. The adhesive mount, if not appropriately attached, can fall off. If properly attached the mounting point is, in theory, permanent, although typically the mirror and the arm are removable from most mounts should you not want to use the mirror. Some of the same types of problems can arise from the clamp style helmet mount mirrors. The clamp has the potential to damage the helmet- though it is unlikely if you use due caution- and there may not be an appropriate mounting point for many helmets. If not adequately attached, the clamp may loosen and fall off.</p>

<h3>Glasses frame mount</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aHi9W.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
Glasses frame mount mirrors are similar to helmet mount mirrors in many ways, but typically sit closer to your face. This can make it a little harder to see around your own head or cause you to have to view the mirror at a more extreme angle. Mounting is easy and they are not permanent. On the other hand, they will not fit all styles of glasses and many of the plastic models are prone to breaking. Metal framed models are available which are less prone to breakage.</p>

<h3>Glasses lens mount</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hxah5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
Lens mount mirrors adhere to the inside of your glasses. They look great because onlookers can't tell that you are using a cycling mirror, and mirrors have a bit of a stigma attached to them, albeit undeserved. The downside to these mirrors are that depending on the shape of your glasses and the shape of your head, you might not be able to see anything with them besides your own face. It's also worth pointing out that if your require corrective lenses (not contacts) then this option is out by default. If this style of mirror works for you, you are likely in a fortunate minority. 
<br/><br/><br/></p>

<h1>On your bike</h1>

<p>This category of mirror will be affixed somewhere to the front of your bike. They will not be in your field of view at all times, which depending on your preference may be mark for or against this category. You will have to take your eyes off from your course more so with a bike mounted mirror than with a head mounted mirror, and to varying degrees depending on where the mirror mounts. Bike mounted mirrors will be easier to look at since you can more easily focus on them with both eyes instead of largely just one as with head mounted mirrors. While riding in a straight line the mirror will always be pointed mostly behind you, but in turns they may point off to one side a little or a lot (the frame mounted mirror described below is the exception). Mounting points tend to be more secure than head mounted mirrors, however bike mounted mirrors have more of a propensity to stick out from the bike in some way. Hand in hand with that issue, bike mounted mirrors can be more of an obstruction than head mounted mirrors both in terms of getting in the way of your hands and in terms of getting knocked against things.</p>

<h3>Bar end mount (flat bar)</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kULTH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
These mirrors have a plug that fits into the end of your handlebar to secure it in place. Many sit up higher than the bar itself, though some models are inline for a cleaner look and less obstruction of the hand(s). These mirrors are typically the easiest to view of the bike mounted mirrors due to their height and the distance out from the bike and rider's body. The other edge to the blade is that they are likely the easiest to knock into something, and depending on their shape they can get in the way. Some models will fit both flat bars and drop bars. </p>

<h3>Bar end mount (drop bar)</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLhJN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
These mirrors work the same way bar end flat bar mirrors work and some models fit both bar styles. For the inline style as pictured above, you get some tradeoffs. The mirror is less obstructive and a little less likely to get bumped into things, but to view it you do have to take your eyes off the the road in front of you more so than with a mirror that sits up higher. Due to the fact that drop bars are narrower than typical flat bars you may end up looking at your leg or bike, especially when turning in the same direction as the side of the bike the mirror is mounted on.</p>

<h3>Hood mount (drop bar)</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5JPz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
There are a couple of different mounting options for this type of mirror- one for integrated shift/brake levers, and one for non integrated levers. Both manage to bring the mirror up higher and further away from the bike, giving you some of the advantages of a raised flat bar style mirror. For the non integrated style lever, these can be a good option if you have bar end shifters. The mirror will still be a little tighter in on the bike, and both types of mounting options run the risk of damaging the lever in the event of an impact.</p>

<h3>Handlebar mount (clamp/strap style)</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cLpIU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
These typically have a plastic clamp, or a rubber or velcro strap to affix them to a handlebar. They are an option if you have no other available mounting points on your handlebars. On the other hand, chances are if all other spots are taken, you will have a hard time finding a place where this type of mirror won't be in your way.</p>

<h3>Frame mount</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qtXV0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br/>
This is a somewhat unusual option that mounts directly to the frame of the bike. It will always look directly behind your direction of travel, regardless of where the bars are pointed, and it obviously won't take up any room on your handlebars. This may be a good option for time trial and triathlon bikes where mounting options on the bars are virtually nonexistent. The biggest problem with this kind of mirror is that it is going to be very difficult to see around your legs as it sits in so tight to the bike. I have not used this type of mirror, but I believe there could be a slight risk with some configurations of knocking against the mirror when out of the saddle and climbing steep ascents.
<br/><br/>
<hr/> 
<br/>
Keep in mind that you may or may not find that any of these issues actually affect you. Preference is going to play a huge part in your decision. Most cycling mirrors are cheap so if you're unsure of what will work best for you, buy a couple of different styles and try them while you ride.</p>

"Are double walled rims worth the money?","21258","","<p>I need a whole new front wheel.</p>

<p>I have been around some of the bike shops in my city and found that the cheapest whole new wheel (wheel, tire, tube, tape) is about £55.</p>

<p>I also asked at the shop I bought my bike about getting a like for like replacement (i.e. the same make of wheel that I am replacing) and the guy helping me said that would cost about £100, probably a bit more.</p>

<p>The increase in cost is because the hub (sorry for my lack of expertise) is aluminium and the rims are double walled rims (which I think are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_wheel#Rim"" rel=""nofollow"">sprint rims</a> judging from the picture in the wikipedia article). He explained that double walled rims significantly increase the strength of the wheel, which is important when hitting potholes.</p>

<p>I have a hybrid bike, and ride almost entirely on road. I currently ride about 54 miles a week, and I'm hoping to increase that to nearly 90 once I'm fit enough, so I guess that's low to medium usage. The roads around here are fairly potholey, but I manage to avoid the holes most of the time.</p>

<p>Given the above, is the more expensive wheel worth the extra money?</p>
","<p>The ""sprint rim"", as described in that article, is a ""tubular"" rim -- intended for a glue-on tire (which maybe your grandfather saw once).  You'd know if you used glue-on tires (and you wouldn't be complaining about spending <em>only</em> 100 pounds for a new wheel).</p>

<p>Other than my old Schwinn (Schwinn had double-walled steel ""tubular"" [in a different sense] rims on most bikes until maybe 1975) I don't think I've ever had a double-walled rim.  My rims have always been extruded aluminum ones more or less along the lines of the ""Rim"" picture near the top of that article.  Such a rim usually has the hollow area similar to what's shown (which makes it ""double"" in one sense, I suppose), though the height of the hollow area may vary from maybe 3mm to 20-30.  These rims don't (as a rule) have double sidewalls, though.</p>

<p>Since the ""sprint rim"" apparently sort of looked like what you have now, I suspect you have an extruded rim where the hollow area is fairly tall and with a triangular cross-section.  Such rims are fairly popular in medium-level road bikes, I gather, partly because they ""look sexy"", but in addition they probably have a slight advantage in terms of dent resistance, though mostly in wheels with low spoke counts where the spokes aren't able to do the job as well.</p>

<p>You don't say what width tire you run.  I've never seen rim sidewalls wear enough that their structural integrity was threatened, but I've always run tires wider than 30mm.  I suppose some of the narrower, more lightly built rims may be in danger of wearing through (though it seems to me that a thicker sidewall would be of more advantage for the weight than a double wall).</p>

<p>Why do you need a whole new front rim?  Did both rim and hub get damaged somehow?</p>

<h2>Added</h2>

<p>A little Googling shows that many refer to the box cross-section extruded rim (which I believe is normal on any medium-priced standard rim) as ""double walled"".  This has nothing to do with the sidewall being doubled.</p>

FSA who makes compact cranksets and was a team sponsor set up his bike with a 52/36 crank; allowing him to climb seated.  FSA did a couple of releases and maybe ads about it - and I started to see a lot more compact doubles in local rides.</p>

The seller told me that a 52 cm cyclocross frame was comparable to a 54 cm road frame.</p>

<p>Is that statement true?  And if it is true, how is that so?</p>
","<p>The first and foremost measurement is effective toptube length. There are, of course, other deciding factors in how a bike fits, but effective toptube length plays the biggest factor in whether a bike is going to fit or not.</p>

<p>Bikes are still measured in terms of seattube length which made some sense when many bikes had the same toptube length regardless of size These days that measurement has virtually no meaning with the varying degrees of compact geometry that most manufacturers implement.</p>

<p>To answer your question, cyclocross bikes don't fit a size bigger than road bikes as a rule. Some folks like to run a size smaller for a cross bike, some a size bigger. Your safest bet is to go for approximately the same cockpit length that you've got on your road bike. If you ride a 58 that has a 58-ish toptube, chances are a 52 even with a 54-ish toptube is going to be too small.</p>

I have replaced many sets of loose BB bearings and several cartridge BB's.  I know nothing about these external things.  Why do there seem to be more of them for sale than cartridge bottom brackets?  Do they have larger, longer-lasting bearings?  Would it benefit me to consider one as opposed to the cartidge BB's that I have been using recently?</p>

<p>I ride pretty seriously for fun, commuting, and errands... I built this bike specifically for doing really hilly weekend rides.  But I'm not a racer.  </p>

<p>Curious.  Many thanks.</p>
","<p>External bottom brackets allow you to have both large bearings and a large, hollow bottom bracket spindle.  A large hollow spindle can be designed to be as stiff as a small solid spindle for less weight.  Smaller bearings reduce the longevity of a bottom bracket, so the typical bottom bracket design allows a narrow range of suitable spindle sizes and bearing sizes - to get the weight savings from a larger spindle you need to sacrifice durability.  Moving the bearings to the outside effectively removes this tradeoff.</p>

<p>There is an additional performance factor in situations where high stiffness is required in that the distance between the cranks and the bearings is reduced, lessening the torque on the axle.</p>

<p>For commuting, errands, recreational riding and other ""normal"" purposes a cartridge bottom bracket is almost always going to be more than sufficient.  If you are particularly concerned about durability, the <a href=""http://janheine.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/skf-bottom-brackets-world-exclusive/"">SKF bottom brackets</a> are engineered for 10 years / 100,000km of riding, but for the price a $25 Shimano cartridge will usually last what feels like forever.</p>

"What road bike tire pressure is best for speed?","20765","","<p>Is the maximum tire pressure always the fastest on a road bike? I've seen the Michelin chart on tire pressure from another question (""<a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2744"">What pressure should I run my Road Bike tyres at?</a>""), but they don't mention whether it is optimized for speed, safety, comfort, or some combination of these.</p>

<p>I have heard that the more pressure a tire has, the faster it goes. But this is not always true on a mountain bike, depending on the road/trail surface. Could it be that a smoother, less jittery ride at 105 psi might be faster than 120 or 130 psi on a road bike?</p>
","<p>I generally agree with <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5546/what-road-bike-tire-pressure-for-best-speed/5549#5549"">Angelo's answer</a>. Tire diameter and your weight will determine the optimal pressure. Beyond that, this is actually a controversial subject.</p>

<p>Let's assume that you want to minimize rolling resistance. ""Rock hard"" isn't necessarily the best approach. One widely cited opinion is that above a certain pressure, there's no benefit in terms of rolling resistance, and the target is a 15% ""drop"" (vertical deformation under load)—it is argued that even with less drop than that (i.e., higher pressure) you do not see an improvement in rolling resistance, so all you're doing with that extra pressure is making the ride harsher.</p>

<p>Here are a <a href=""http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">couple</a> of <a href=""http://www.bikequarterly.com/images/TireDrop.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">articles</a> (pdf) discussing pressure, rolling resistance, and tire drop. You can see that there's a diminishing-returns curve in terms of power savings at higher pressures. The second one includes a graph showing how much you should inflate a tire to get a 15% drop depending on how much load there is on that wheel and how wide the tire is.</p>

<p>I should point out that this opinion is not universally held. Jobst Brandt, for one, is skeptical, but I'm not sure what he recommends.</p>

"Pain on the sides of my feet","20682","","<p>I've been having pain on the sides of my feet (outside about midway back on the foot(. I was wearing a pair of Sidi's size 43. Went to a Specialized 44. Still have the pain, so I'm thinking it's something else, like how I have the cleats bolted on the shoes or even the pedals. How do I diagnose further? </p>
","<p>Two major possibilities here. Could be a combination of both. I'm tempted to say it's the first one I'm going to talk about:<br><br> Given where you said your feet are hurting (outside, front) I'd say you have your cleats toed in too much. This is caused by your foot constantly trying to re-align towards what's neutral for you. <br>Here's what to do:<br><br>What you need to do is take your right shoe, loosen the cleat bolts, and with the sole facing you turn the cleat ever so slightly- just a couple degrees before re-tightening. Take your left shoe and do the opposite; turn the cleat counter-clockwise just a couple of degrees. See if this alleviates the pain at all. Repeat if necessary. You'll know you've gone too far if you start to get pain on the inside front or outside rear of your foot.<br><br><br>
The other possibility is that the shoe doesn't fit you quite right.<br> It may be that the front of your foot is a little wide and you need a wider toe box. Specialized shoes do have pretty wide toe boxes up to their Pro line. The S-Works models get noticeably narrower in the front of the shoe. Despite the fact that you were fitted for a standard width, a wider shoe may be more comfortable. As long as your foot isn't sliding around side to side the shoe isn't too wide. It's important to note that your foot flattens/widens when you press down hard on the pedal so if your shoe is already pretty snug in the front you may need more room. The material that specialized makes their shoes out of (at least the uppers on their S-Works shoes) does not stretch very much, so if it's at all tight now it will probably remain that way.<br><br>
Don't dismiss the possibility that the shoe may just not fit your foot well from the get-go, regardless of width or size. Cycling shoes are deeply a matter of personal preference, arguably falling right behind saddles. What works great for one person may be a device of torture for another. Keep this in mind and if the above suggestions don't help you, you might want to consider buying some cheaper model used shoes from different brands on ebay before forking over big bucks for a nice pair of shoes that you can't really try before you buy.</p>

"Why are disc brakes rare on road bikes?","20562","","<p>Window shopping for road bikes, I can't see many that have disc brakes. What are the reasons for this?</p>
","<h2>2016 Update</h2>

<p>Disc brakes are now common on road bikes, even racing road bikes in the professional peloton. Most of the major bike manufacturers offer disc and non-disc options for most of their bike models. Some ""endurance"", ""adventure"", and ""cyclocross"" (drop bar bikes sold under ""road"" category, but intended for some off-road use) models only offer options with disc brakes now.</p>

<p>However, there is some opposition to their use in certain types of road racing. If a rider's leg contacts a disc rotor while the bike is going fast, that rotor will likely cause a serious injury (it's spinning fast and pretty thin, so cuts flesh easily).</p>

<p>The advantages of disc brakes are primarily in wet and/or muddy conditions. In dry conditions, a good rim brake can lock both wheels up just as well as a disc brake. So for road-racing under dry conditions, there's no real advantage to disc brakes, and appears to be some disadvantages.</p>

<p>Many of the ""racer"" style road bikes follow what's allowed for professional road bike racing, so it's possible that the current opposition to disc brakes in professional road racing will eventually lead to them becoming less popular on road bikes.</p>

<p>Personally, my next new bike will definitely have disc brakes. I don't race in a peloton, I do sometimes ride in the wet, and it's much cheaper to replace a rotor than to replace a rim or wheel. (rim brakes eventually wear down the rim and make you replace it)</p>

<h2>Original answer</h2>

<p>I think it mostly comes down to one primary thing: <strong>disc brakes weigh more</strong> and road bikes are supposed to be light.  Also, you need a heavier wheel and heavier fork to handle the forces of disc braking, which compounds the weight.</p>

<p>Additionally, the advantages to disc brakes (working better in mud/dirt, easier to work with a suspension, work with really wide tires) generally don't apply to road bikes or aren't what the road bike was designed for.  For any bike on the road the only likely advantage of disc brakes would be that they're more likely to work after you've ridden through something nasty (mud, puddle with oil on it, etc) that's deep enough to get on the rims, and you probably want to be avoiding any puddles you can't see the bottom of anyways.</p>

<p>Probably the final reason is simply that disc brakes (generally) cost more than rim brakes.</p>

<p>I have seen bikes made for the road that had disc brakes, but they're generally not the typical ""go fast"" road bike.  (Example: <a href=""http://www.konaworld.com/sutra.cfm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kona Sutra</a>)</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether or not it's worth changed my existing tires for these. My main desire is faster, easier riding on the road. Will these (or similar) tires provide less rolling resistance over the default tires I already have?</p>
","<p>Yes, definitely -- if you're riding on mostly paved roads, switch to bald-ish tires. Rolling resistance is huge and equates directly to effort, though as you start going really fast it is dwarfed by air and gravity of course. Per <a href=""http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance"">the graph here</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tWe9O.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, one caution: road tires tend to be skinny, and you probably want fat-but-bald tires instead. If you go from a 35mm wide treaded tire to a 25mm bald tire, you will feel a lot more bumps.</p>

<p>So in summary: bald, for sure, but don't sacrifice too much width/comfort in the process.</p>

"Most Crucial Gear/ Accessories for a (Road) Cycling Beginner?","20533","","<p>Some background information on myself before I get to the question:</p>

<p>I've decided to get in to cycling both as a hobby and because I need the activity. (Though I'm honestly driven more by the former - I've always enjoyed riding since I was a kid.) I already have a bike that seems decent to me (for someone in my position), but I'm also a newcomer and don't know that much. It's a <a href=""http://www.bikepedia.com/quickbike/BikeSpecs.aspx?Year=2004&amp;Brand=Cannondale&amp;Model=R800&amp;Type=bike"" rel=""nofollow"">2004 Cannondale R800</a>. When I was about 15, my dad and I each got one to start together. Long story short, we had some <em>demotivating</em> initial experiences with the clipless pedals, moved shortly after, and soon the bikes were (sadly) forgotten.</p>

<p>Now (~6 years later), I'm looking to <em>actually</em> get into it, and it seems that there is a lot of ""essential"" gear I should buy. I have somewhat limited funds (as a student), and can't do it all at once, so was hoping for some guidance in both what I <strong>absolutely</strong> need to get, and what would be more ancillary. Also, recommendations on around how much I should be spending on different items would be helpful. For example, I know headlights can run anywhere from $10-$1000+, but I don't know what the sweet spots between performance and value are.</p>

<p>I live in a fairly rural environment in a university town of ~21k people. There is a decent bike shop in town considering the size, however their focus is much more casual/ kid-oriented.</p>

<ul><li>Jersey (longsleeve + shortsleeve)
<li>Cycling Shorts
<li>Cycling Shoes
<li>Helmet
<li>(Small) Saddle Bag
<li>Pump
<li>Emergency Patch Kit

<li>Cycling computer / heart monitor (I do have an Android phone that I know can facilitate this point.)
<li>Additional clothing, though nothing particular at the moment
<li>Gloves
<li>Tool kit

","<p>Sounds like you have the basics covered pretty well.... If you're turning in some serious mileage, you want to be able to handle flats and minor repairs on the road.<br>
Minimum is a good frame pump ( a lot of the mini pumps have trouble getting past 50 pounds or so...) spare tube, tire tools, etc.  Some of the handy little hand-cleaning wipes are a good idea as well.
A multi-tool that will take care of most emergencies is a good investment; it should include a chain breaker, allen wrenches to fit the fasteners on your bike, etc.
Some money is never a bad idea.  You may just HAVE to have a donut....</p>

"How do I keep my seat from tilting back?","20458","","<p>When I first got this bike, I got the saddle adjusted almost perfectly.  Recently it slipped back (so that the nose sticks up).  I loosened the bolt under the saddle, tilted the saddle back into the proper position, tightened the bolt up, and within a week the nose had tilted back up. Did the same thing again, but cranked the bolt even tighter; still happened.</p>

<p>I noticed that there's visible ""scarring"" or scraping on the top of the seat tube where the clamp that holds the saddle (not sure the proper term for those pieces) grabs onto the tube.</p>

<p>This is a 2009 Surly Long Haul Trucker (touring style bike; equipped like a commuter) with the stock seatpost (pretty sure it's 27.2mm.  No real branding on the seat post).  I'm a fairly heavy rider (near 250 pounds) and I do sometimes ride over some pretty rough stuff, so I suspect that might be part of the problem.</p>

<p>So far I'm seeing maybe 3 options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a hex tool with more leverage and tighten that thing down even more</li>
<li>Some sort of super glue or epoxy (or maybe just a bit of old innertube?) to keep the seatpost from sliding back</li>
<li>Replace the seatpost (and clamp assembly, of course).  Except I don't know what to replace it with that wouldn't just get the same problem again...</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Pics: (sorry, phone pics, but I think they're workable)</p>

<p>First: overall picture, very careful to take the picture close to level.  Top tube has just a teensy amount of slant, almost level.

<p>Closer in (you can see some of the scarring on the seatpost):

<p>Attempt at closer-in picture of scarring after disassembly, but can't focus close with this camera:

<p>Here's the saddle itself, which has no bending, no visible damage to the rails, etc.:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSeu3.jpg"" alt=""seat is fine""></p>

<p>Here's the actual pieces of the ""clamp"".  On the right is the bottom piece that sits on top of the seatpost and under the seat rails, there's matching ""scarring"" at the points that touch the seatpost. On the left is the top piece that goes on top of the rails. On top is the bolt that goes through everything from the bottom (with a curved sort of washer thing that fits into a matching curved area on the seatpost).  The opposite side of the ""bottom piece"" basically looks just like the visible side of the ""top piece"", and the opposite side of the ""top piece"" is boring.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7Tbu.jpg"" alt=""clamp pieces""></p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Used a hex tool with a longer arm (more leverage), removed the bolt, greased it up and tightened it as much as possible, not worrying about damaging the already damaged seatpost further. The grease helps to allow a bit more tightening. This held up for a couple months but eventually seat started sliding back again.</p>

<p><strong>Final solution</strong>: <a href=""http://bikethomson.com/products/seatposts/elite/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thomson Elite seatpost</a>, specifically the shorter model with a setback in silver ordered through my LBS. (they had black in stock but decided I was willing to wait an extra week to get silver) It's a two-bolt design that seems to be the top-end for seatposts that don't slip.  I considered a Salsa two-bolt seatpost that was a less expensive, but it didn't seem to be as heavy-duty.  I also considered a <a href=""http://www.rivbike.com/products/show/nitto-s-83-seatpost/11-078"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nitto S-83</a> which is a two-bolt seatpost about the same price as the Thomson and has more of the classic touring look to it, but the Thomson seemed to be a bit better engineered and I like the markings on the Thomson that help you keep the same adjustment.</p>
","<p>The problem is that there is only one bolt holding the seat at the angle you want.  Put enough torque on the back of the saddle and can overcome the friction that's holding the seat in place.</p>

<p>A few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tighten up that bolt as much as you dare (but you've already tried that).</li>
<li>Increase the friction between the seat post and the bottom of the seat clamp -- either scuff it up or use some carbon grease (ask your LBS, I've used it to keep my seat post from sliding down).</li>
<li>Switch to a seat post that uses a two-bolt design to hold the seat in place.  This is what my current and previous bikes used, one bolt pulls the nose down and the other tilt the seat back.  Get enough tension on the two and your seat stays right where you want it to.</li>

To give only a single example, a motorist turning right at an intersection scans to the left for approaching traffic on the new road, and cannot see or anticipate a fast-moving wrong-way bicyclist approaching from the right.</p>

"Mysterious case: chain falling off large chainring, how to fix? ","20261","","<p>On my commuter bike I decided to rid myself of the small inner chain ring (which is almost never used) and front dérailleur (now redundant). However, I have come across an unusual problem. Whilst cycling <strong>the chain is coming off</strong> of the outer chain ring and falling onto the crank arm. This usually coincides with a shift of the rear dérailleur onto a smaller sprocket, although notably not onto the highest gearing - it has happened shifting from the 5th to 6th scrocket on the 12-27 cassette for example. Furthermore, I am not exerting abnormal force on the crank, just sitting and riding as normal. This just happens out of the blue and as you can imagine is quite disconcerting/dangerous. </p>

<p>I have considered and checked the following so far: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chain length</strong> - tension is good so no obvious problems there...</li>
<li><strong>Chain dirty</strong> - it most certainly is not, it has only seen 200 miles and its lubed up a treat ;-) </li>
<li><strong>Chain ring to cassette alignment</strong> - Hollowtech II BB and Ultegra 53T 6600 crank in 68mm shell, standard setup afaict, no obvious problems there... </li>
<li><strong>Lack of front-dérailleur</strong> - I removed this since there is only one chain ring - could this be a factor that prevented me noticing the problem before (surely not...) </li>
<li><strong>Chain ring worn</strong> - the chain ring looks in pretty good shape to me</li>
</ul>

<p>I experimented briefly, turning the crank and applying a very slight outward pull (away from frame) on the chain and it promptly fell off onto the crank. Frankly, I was surprised how such a small misalignment could cause the chain the fall off... </p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> Has anyone else encountered this problem before?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Any comments on the things I have checked</strong> (why I may be mistaken in my assessment of the problem)? </p>

<p><strong>Other possible causes I have missed would be gratefully received</strong> - this is spoiling an otherwise nice bike and I really do not want to go back to using the double crank configuration if possible. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUEu6.jpg"" alt=""Ultegra crank adapted to use only 53T outer chainring""></p>
","<p>Yeah. A modern double chainring is ramped and pinned, in order to be more easily shifted from one ring to the next. Simply put, the chainring ""wants"" to pass off the chain to the next cog. Without a derailleur to keep it in place, the lateral pull of the chain shifting across the rear, combined with some road jostling, can make the chain fall off the front. </p>

<p>A couple solutions: </p>

<ol>
<li>install a singlespeed chainring without ramps or pins, with ""straight"" teeth.  </li>
<li>use an outer chainring guard and inner ""dog tooth"" chain keeper  </li>
<li>combine the two (which is the best solution).</li>
</ol>

<p>The free and easy way to keep it on while looking at other solutions is to reinstall the front derailler and adjust the limit screws so it keeps the chain in place.</p>

<p>This is a pretty common concern with cyclocross. Racers often use a single-chainring setup for the sake of reliability, and either or a dual chainguard or chainguard-and-chain watcher setup for just such reasons (also because they keep picking the bike up and putting it down whilst running and jumping over stuff), so you get stuff like this: <a href=""http://www.bikeman.com/CC-SRAMS300CX.html"">http://www.bikeman.com/CC-SRAMS300CX.html</a>.</p>

<p>When I commute I eat (breakfast, and late afternoon snack) before I ride, but I eat and drink nothing during the ride.</p>

<p>Why have they disappeared? I thought they were a fantastic product . . .</p>
","<p>You should not be getting multiple flat tires in such a short timespan. I commute on poorly-maintained roads in Atlanta, and have not had a flat tire in 4,000 miles.</p>

<p>In order of estimated likelihood, either:</p>

<li>your tires are not properly inflated</li>
<li>your tires are worn or punctured and need to be replaced</li>
<li>you have a sharp object embedded on the inside of your tire</li>
<li>you are exceedingly unlucky</li>
</ol>

<p>If you've just started cycling again, I think it's exceedingly probable that you've simply neglected to inflate your tires to their recommended pressure. Standard road tires should be inflated to pressures of 100PSI and beyond. Mountain bike tires (which are awful for road use, but I digress...) require much less. It's easy to grossly underestimate how much to inflate a bike tire, and a standard hand pump will likely only get you to 30-60 PSI before you give up.</p>

<p>Take your bicycle to your nearest bike shop and have them examine the situation. Flat tires should not be a common occurrence.</p>

"A general explanation of rim, tire and tube specifications","19643","","<p>My bike's manufacturer page specifies that it has a rim size of <code>700CX14GX36H</code>.

<p>I just replaced my tube by myself for the first time, and it was easy enough to determine that I needed a 700x28c size tube, but I would really like to know what all these specifications I'm seeing mean.  </p>

<li>taking 14 gauge spokes</li>
<li>with 36 spoke holes</li>

<p>So, you need to know the <code>700c</code> bit if you're buying tyres or tubes, you need to know the <code>14g</code> bit if you're replacing spokes, and you need to know the <code>36H</code> bit if you're re-lacing the rim to a new hub (which will need to have 36 spoke holes to match).</p>

<h2>Some Context</h2>

<p>700c and 14 gauge spokes is standard for road bike wheels.
36 is a fairly high spoke count, meaning it should be durable and relatively easy to repair and re-true. On the other hand, lower spoke-count wheels may be lighter and more aerodynamic (at the possible cost of being more fragile and harder to repair).</p>

<blockquote>

<p><code>700x23</code> means a tyre fitting a 700c rim, with approximate inflated cross-sectional diameter of 23mm. <code>700x32</code> is a fatter (32mm vs. 23mm) tyre for the same diameter rim. Note that even for the ""correct"" diameter, different tyres fit more or less easily on different rims.</p>

<p>A tube described as <code>700x18-23</code> would fit the first (<code>700x23</code>) tyre, but would be likely to burst before filling the greater volume of the fatter <code>700x32</code> tyre.</p>

"Replacing suspension with a solid fork","19550","","<p>I have an older version of this bike: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CivQA.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>They have made some changes to the components since I bought my bike but it is more or less the same.  Here are the <a href=""http://www.eccyclesupply.com/k2bikes/index.php?page=bike_detail&amp;cat_id=1&amp;b_id=35"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">specs on the newer bike</a>.  </p>

<p>I was hoping to put a solid fork on my bike for the winter.  I want to keep the mountain feel and have lots of clearance for wide tires, etc but I want to get rid of the weight and give my fork a rest.  </p>

<p>When choosing a solid fork what do I need to know?  </p>

<ul>
<li>Will any solid fork fit onto my bike?  Do forks come in different sizes?  Different diameters?  Different lengths?  I heard something like you need a special fork if you are going to put it on a bike that was designed to be used with shocks.  </li>
<li>I know that I want a fork with disk break mounts so this makes the search slightly more difficult.  Ideally I would also like rack/fender mounts.  (For future touring).  </li>
<li>My wheel size is 26 inches, what would happen if I used a 700c fork on my bike?  This seller claims thats what he was using <a href=""http://www.pinkbike.com/buysell/list/?region=3&amp;countryid=35&amp;provid=7&amp;category=10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this solid fork</a> for. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>Thanks for the great information.  After reading I have been looking around for a used local fork.  I think that I found one possibility.  But any feed back would be appreciated.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The fork was designed to be used with 700C or 29 inch wheels but it has an axel to crown length of roughly 17 inches (431 mm).  I currently have 100mm Travel in my suspension fork so <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2568/replacing-suspension-with-a-solid-fork/2576#2576"">Lantius says</a> that I should get a fork with a length of 455 mm (17.9 inches).  Is this reasonable?  Does it matter if it was designed for a 700C tire if the fork length is correct?</p></li>
<li><p>As you can see in the picture of the fork the fork has <em>some</em> rake.  Is this a problem?  Will that amount of rake make the bike ride strangely/differently?</p></li>
<li><p>The steer tube/ headset size is 1 1/8th standard size which is the same as my bike so no concern there.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of the fork: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xS2jI.jpg"" alt=""alt text""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HBFx.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>
","<p>It sounds like you've sorted out the first issue, headset size.  You'll need something with a  1 1/8"" (also seen as 1.125"" or 9/8"") steerer.</p>

<p>Your bicycle's handling is based on the geometry. Changing the axle-to-crown distance will change the angle of your head tube, altering your bicycle's handling significantly.  The other major characteristic of a fork is ""rake"", or the distance that the axle is in front of an imaginary line down the center of the steerer.  Within 5-10mm of rake change you should notice a fairly minimal effect on the bike's handling, which is good because suspension fork rake is rarely published and measuring it directly is difficult.</p>

<p>The axle-to-crown distance is one factor, to get that right - assuming your bike has an equivalent fork - you should be looking for a ""100mm suspension-corrected"" rigid fork.  In practice this means a fork with an axle-crown distance of about 455mm.</p>

<p>If you want a 100mm suspension corrected, 26"" wheeled fork with disc brakes that <em>also</em> has rack (I'm assuming you mean midfork low-rider rack mounts) and fender mounts, your options list is relatively limited.  The new <a href=""http://surlybikes.com/parts/troll_fork/"">Surly Troll Fork</a> is likely to be one of your few options.</p>

This morning, I changed the flat and put on some brand new tires I bought last week.</p>

<p>When I take it out for a ride, I find that the freewheel is nearly locked up!  I can forcibly move it by dragging on the pedals and bunching-up the chain, but it's not easy.  I've tried adjusting the tension on my quick-release, but that doesn't seem to make a difference.</p>

<p>The freewheel on my <a href=""http://www.sram.com/sram/road/products/s27-al-comp-wheelset"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SRAM S27</a> has always been tight (to the point of putting some slack in the chain when back-pedaling), but now I can't even coast!  How did this happen, and what should I do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit - the next day:</strong></p>

<p>I made my adjustments on Tuesday morning as I said in the comments, but after only a 15 mile ride the freehub was completely tightened back up again!</p>

<p>After looking into it a bit more carefully, I found a <a href=""http://cdn.sram.com/cdn/farfuture/7qFTEPZ1BflbDW7bZss7TKs89MxWQC2zKYGt_-eHOVo/mtime:1301333941/sites/default/files/techdocs/sram_s30_s27_wheel_service_manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">service manual</a> for my wheels with some nice pictures.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFfBs.png"" alt=""S27 rear hub assembly""></p>

<p>Unfortunately because it tightened right back up that obviously wasn't a very robust solution.</p>

<p>In my case, the ""end cap"" was tighening on its own during rides.  Normally, this little set screw is supposed to keep the end cap from threading or un-threading (ie. you get the adjustment just right, apply the set screw, and it should all just stay put).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ubzx5.png"" alt=""Adjustment set screw""></p>

<p>The set screw actually applies pressure to a rubber o-ring, which in turn presses against the threads on the axle to keep the end cap from turning.</p>

<p>On my wheel, that o-ring had actually partially disintegrated where the set screw contacted it.  So instead of pressing a healthy o-ring against the threads, it just sort of mashed some rubber particulate in there.</p>

<p>The <em>right</em> solution to this problem is probably to get a new o-ring.  The route I took, however, was to rotate the o-ring about 90&deg; so the set screw was once again above a healthy bit of rubber.  I then re-adjusted the end cap tension and re-applied the set screw.</p>

<p>Hopefully that keeps me going for a while without tightening up again.  Thanks for all the help, everyone!</p>

","<p>You can (theoretically) mount any 700x(something) tire on any 700c  (ISO 622) rim. However, you need to make sure the frame (and brakes if rim brakes are used) can clear the tire without rubbing. </p>

<p>You generally want to match the <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#width"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rim width to the tire</a> though -- too narrow or too wide of a tire on a rim can lead to tire/rim damage or bad handling.</p>

<p>In your case, the rim width is 17 mm and the chart linked above says 25-37 should all be fine.</p>

<p>As for overinflating, why would you overinflate? You will use a higher pressure with a narrower tire, but overinflating means putting too much air in. And this can be bad for the rim. The right tire pressure is not whats written on the sidewall of the tire -- in fact, you'll almost never use that much pressure. We have many questions on tire pressure setup, so I encourage you to use the search feature to look at some of them. </p>

If I push myself for 10km (6.2 miles), I expect it would take more out of me than if I hammered for 42km (26 miles) miles, but that's because I'm a better cyclist.  I think the hammering would take just as much extra out of some runner friends of mine.</p>

<p>Weak cyclists can benefit from drafting a strong cyclist in a way that weak runners can't, but I think I'm strong enough to drop a strong runner/weak cyclist so that isn't a factor.

You create your map through their site (as it happens one of the options is to use Google mapping, but there are other options too - including bike path mapping which may be useful for avoiding cars). You save your routes on their site, under an account that you create.</p>

<p>I use this part of their service a lot and I know it works well.</p>

<p>As regards tracking, they offer an Android app designed for exactly that. I have not tried it.</p>

<p>I have a pay subscription with these guys and it didn't cost a lot. But I know they also offer a free account so you might be able to do what I've said for free. I know the Android app is available through the Google App Store but have no idea whether it costs. </p>

<p>Probably worth saying that there are a bunch of known issues with using phones for this kind of thing. Two that immediately spring to mind are battery life (GPS and screen are always on) and a way of securing the phone to the bike without the risk of it flying off.</p>

"Can your rims wear down from too much braking?","19001","","<p>I have a question about rims based on information in <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3997/best-brake-pads-for-long-distance-travelling"">another question</a>.  The person asking states that he doesn't want his rims wearing down.  Is this really a problem?  Assuming you don't wear the brake pads down to the metal, can the rubber pads actually wear down rims?  Does it make a difference if you use aluminium, steel, or carbon rims?  My rims are aluminium with  tiny grooves on them.  Is there anything I should look for to ensure that they aren't worn down?  I have over 10,000 KM of mostly city riding on my bike.</p>
","<p>I have worn through quite a few rims, mostly because I live in a hilly area and I ride my bikes more than I clean them. That said, I do think that if you are to clean anything on a bike then the rims are probably what you want to be cleaning most importantly.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I inflated the tyres to the value on the sidewall, walked away from the garage and heard a very loud bang. The rim had split in two on one side and I was very glad I was not in the shed at that time.</p>

<p>A year before that - on a small wheeled folding bike - I had a similar problem. Although I had been running some experimental brake blocks that were supposed to be 'extra good' the problem was the wheel size - smaller wheels wear out quicker because there is a smaller braking surface. A 5cm long section appeared buckled, as if I had hit a kerb, which I never do on a folding bike for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I have also had some high-end Mavic rims wear through. Those had holes in the outer sidewall but they did not fail in a catastrophic way. However, they did feel 'spongy' and that was not just spoke tension.</p>

<p>Obviously the brakes on my 3-speed will never wear through its 50's vintage genuine-stainless-steel rims, but stopping distances are comparable to what you get with an aircraft carrier. Steel is such a no-no for rims - heavy and useless under braking.</p>

<p>As for how to mitigate against catastrophic rim failure, you may want to consider getting wheels with 'wear indicators' in them. A lot of the better MTBs and Road Bikes have these. Alex Rims - as found on Giant MTB's have the 'wear indicator' - this appears as a black line in the side of the rim. This should stand out against the un-anodized sidewall and when it does not you could potentially have problemos. I have not tried them myself, personally I think that it is better to have a feel for one's bike - if the wheel is too springy you know that it is on its way. The problem is rarely with the front rim (unless you do all your braking on the front). During regular cleaning you can feel the concave side of the rim, and those grooves but you don't really know if they are getting a bit too paper thin.</p>

<p>Returning to my comparative experience of the Mavic's that survived having big holes in them and the cheap rims that failed, I would be more inclined to go for rims like the Mavic where the outer sidewall is not 100% important to the structural integrity. The 'wear line' is a good idea but not really for me.</p>

<p>I managed 6000 miles - 25 miles *5 * 50 on the folding bike before the rims went, this was a hard commute with a lot of braking due to how London is a 'sliding block puzzle'. 6000 miles is an accurate guess on how long the cheapo rims on that bike lasted, that is around the 10K mark in 'clicks'. I did trial quite a few products on that bike including some 'extra good' brake blocks. The circumference braking area was probably half that of your bike, so, by rule of thumb I reckon you have got 1/3 to 1/2 way through your rims.</p>

<p>Nowadays I do not reach for the back brake so readily - certainly not automatically when the front one will do. For me rim wear is a real consideration. </p>

"Cartridge hubs vs loose-ball hubs","18974","","<p>My LBS recommended cartridge hubs to me. Here are my doubts.</p>

<p>Seeing as how I never ride in the rain or any such wet substances, I don't really need the ""completely sealed"" feature.</p>

<p>Sheldon Brown says that if taken care of, the body of a loose-ball hub will last indefinitely. (not the balls and cones). So if you maintain your hub, you should be able to indefinitely avoid having to re-spoke your wheel.</p>

<p>Sealed bottom brackets make sense, because it's easy to pull your cranks off and swap it out. But if you have a cartridge hub, when it wears out you will need to re-spoke your wheel. Am I right about that, or do cartridge hubs have a system for just replacing the bearings?</p>

<p>Also, is it possible that a cartridge hub would last as long as the rim? Then you would just replace the whole wheel once it started having problems.</p>
","<p>The tools are relatively expensive compared to cone wrenches, but all cartridge bearings can be replaced if needed. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.enduroforkseals.com/id176.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enduroforkseals.com/id176.html</a></p>

<p>You need both a puller and a press of some kind. </p>

<p>Cartridge bearings last a very long time with no maintenance at all. </p>

<p>Since installing fancy ceramic bearings is part of high end road cycling these days I would think most competent shops would have the tools and knowledge to replace a cartridge bearing. But if you don't ride in the rain or power wash your bike, it's unlikely you'll ever need to replace them during the life time of a 
single rim. </p>

<p>For road bike wheels, I don't have preference either way. It really depends whether you have the tools, skills and time to keep a traditional cone and ball hub working.</p>

"Why use 54T (or bigger) chainring?","18945","","<p>In time trial races, I see people are using these big chainrings. Is 50/11 combination doesn't give enough top speed? What's the real advantage? I can only think of the negative, which is it makes the speed difference between two cogs wider.</p>
","<p>UCI time trials are a class race contested in the tiny fractions of a percent, tiny differences in equipment become very important. Riders practice in wind tunnels to tweak everything from clothing to pedalling style, because a shift that gives an overall gain of 0.01% in speed can result in a win.</p>

<p>Considering more than just the top gear, the jump from 50/11 - 50/12 (the two highest gears) and 54/12 - 54/13 is noticeably bigger (9% vs 8%). That may well explain the change, even if it results is slightly lower peak speed, since it means that on slight slopes the rider has better gear options available. Note that on downhill sections the 54/12 rider has the 54/11 ratio available, where the 50/11 rider has no choice but to spin faster.</p>

<p>The difference between gearing 50/11 and 54/12 is about 1% (4.545454... vs 4.5). The larger chainring is bigger and heavier so it has more aero drag but lower mechanical losses (especially the loss difference between 11T and 12T is significant... but that loss should be less than 2% of the total power output). I suspect the human power output difference between those two at a given speed is less important than the comfort factor of being able to choose a gear that feels right.</p>

<p>It does not even have to translate directly into better average or total power output from the rider, as long as it gives a better time. Also possible is that it makes the rider feel faster, and that directly affects performance.</p>

<hr>

<p>edit in response to imel96's question in comments: explain more about gear ratio selection (sorry, can't do tables here so you're seeing a spreadsheet turned into preformatted text)</p>

<p>When riding people care about pedal rpm, which is determined by gearing. Humans have a power/speed curve. The further from their optimum cadence they are, the less efficient they are (and in a time trial efficiency is what matters). The closer the gear ratios are, the closer to the right gear they can get so the closer to their peak efficiency point they can stay.</p>

<p>This wee table shows what's likely to be the next 4 cogs lower than the original question on the two cassettes we're discussing. The question I'm looking at here is ""going up a slight rise, what gear options are available"".</p>

<pre><code>54/12 top gear  
cassette cogs   ratio to next gear  Development (m)
12          9.05
13  92.31%  8.35
14  92.86%  7.76
15  93.33%  7.24
16  93.75%  6.79
average 93.06%  

50/11 top gear  
11          9.14
12  91.67%  8.38
13  92.31%  7.73
14  92.86%  7.18
15  93.33%  6.70
average 92.54%  
</code></pre>

<p>The immediate answer is that the 54T rider can make a slightly smaller shift. Ratios let us ignore the actual gear and focus on the size of the shift. The 54T rider shifts to a gear 92.3% of their current one, the 50T rider drops to 91.67%. And that happens every time - on average the next lower gear is 93% for the 54T rider, and 92.54% for the 50T.</p>

<p>(it's possible that the 54/12 rider will keep the 11T small cog so they have a downhill gear, but we can ignore that for this comparison because in that case the 50/11 rider is out of options). </p>

<p>That sounds really minor, but remember that those riders are fighting it out in the fractions of a percentage point.</p>

"How to set up bike so that back-pedalling stops the rear wheel?","18695","","<p>My first bike was a 1976 Raleigh Strika. It was brilliant and was distinguished by having only a front brake lever. To get the rear wheel to stop one simply back-pedalled. This was a v. efficient way of stopping and had the bonus of making your bike skid in a most excellent way.</p>

<p>I have a simple <a href=""http://bit.ly/unGpbf"" rel=""nofollow"">8-speed hybrid mountain/road bike</a> now  and was wondering if anyone knew if there was any way of modding it to replicate the behaviour of my beloved Strika. I guess I <em>might</em> lose my gears after such an alteration, but I can live with that.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, it's not really feasible to convert that particular bicycle to use a coaster brake.  That bicycle has <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/fixed-conversion.html#vertical"" rel=""nofollow"">vertical dropouts</a>, which means that the chain is kept taut using a derailleur or other spring-based <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/singlespeed.html#tensioners"" rel=""nofollow"">chain tensioner</a>.  A chain tensioner only applies force opposing the forward direction, however, so when you attempt to pedal backwards to actuate the coaster brake you'll only end up bending the tensioner back around and dropping the chain rather than stopping.  (Without a tensioner of some sort it's extremely difficult to set the drivetrain up with the correct amount of slack; sometimes involving chain half-links and filing the dropout can get you close but there are no guarantees.)</p>

<p>Depending on your preferences, you can get up to 9 speeds with a coaster brake using the SRAM i9 internal hub; cheaper options also exist for 8-,7-,5-,and 3-speeds.  I personally have a soft spot for the Sturmey Archer 3-speed coaster brake for it's balance of simplicity and a relatively wide (33%) gear spacing, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to look for a relatively inexpensive single speed, fixed gear, or already-coaster'd bike to start from.  If it's got horizontal dropouts or track ends you're in business.  Frames purpose-built for coaster brakes will often have a tab brazed onto the non-driveside chainstay for screwing the anti-rotation arm to (lest the brake simply spin the hub backwards instead of stop you) but a p-clamp or hose clamp can be used as an adapter trivially.</p>

Are all skewers compatible with all bikes, or are there different types?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, the answer is no. Not all skewers are compatible with all quick release wheels. There are different diameters and widths of skewers. Notably, many downhill bikes have beefier skewers that are built with a much larger diameter to be more durable. Bikes with wider and narrower axles will have less standard skewers too.</p>

<p>In your case, it is likely that the skewers will be compatible. Even if the skewer isn't quite long enough to have threads protruding from the nut, it will still be okay if the difference is less than 2mm.</p>

"Straight-pull spokes - worth it?","18639","","<p>Straight-pull spokes have been around for awhile on MTB wheels, but mainly just on very expensive wheelsets (Mavic Deemax for example).  Recently the better wheel component manufacturers have been getting in on this by selling straight-pull spokes and compatible hubs individually, and they are generally considerably more expensive than the 'normal' variety.</p>

<p>However in my many years of snapping spokes they have <em>never</em> snapped at the elbow (the 'weak' point straight-pulls are supposed to address), they <em>always</em> break in the centre - presumably because the double-butting process has moved the weak point there.</p>

<p>So my question is this: Are straight-pull spokes worth it, or are they another expensive marketing gimick to solve a problem that doesn't exist?</p>
","<p>This is debatable, but since you asked, here go my cents:</p>

<p>A wheel has three ""parts"": rim, hub and spokes.</p>

<p>Spokes have two functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sustain the vertical forces on the wheel (weight of the rider, landing, etc.);</li>
<li>Transmit torque while accelerating (rear wheel only) and braking;</li>
</ol>

<p>Any properly laced wheel will do it, but there are many ways to design the connection of the spokes to the hub, or to the rim. These manufacturers have chosen to make the spokes ""elbowless"", which could result in less chance of failure, and could result in other side-benefits, like flangeless hubs, or fancier-looking wheels.</p>

<p>I'd much rather use standard components only, since they are easily replacable and swappable. I sometimes damage some rim, then I can change the rim only, because the nipple-hole connection is standard. I also can change the hub if needed, because the flange-elbow connection is standard. In the other hand these fancy wheels are proprietary, and you have only a single source of spare parts, which tend to be VERY expensive and sometimes are not available on the shelf.</p>

<p>As a bottomline, my spokes tend to break at the elbow, rarely at the thread end. I don't use butted spokes, so that could make some difference. Recently, I had some breakages at the mid-length, but I suppose this is due to excessive weight per wheel (tandem) and sub-optimal quality spokes.</p>

<p>Final thought: I would only spend big in such a wheel if I have a very well-defined reason. These are made for racing, and for anyone who doesn't race (and isn't sponsored), I'm pretty sure the cost is too much for the benefit.</p>

","<p>The current Ultegra chain rings are in fact physically compatible with the 105. They do not look good on the 105 crank, however, because when Shimano redesigned the Ultegra and DuraAce level cranks to their Hollowtech II design, the made the chain rings hollow as well.</p>

<p>Th point where the chain ring meets the crank arm is noticeably thicker, and shaped quite different on the Ultegra chain ring and crank, compared to the 105.</p>

"How do bicycle power meters work?","18283","","<p>What exactly are they measuring? How do they measure it? What are the implications of the different approaches on accuracy / speed of getting a good measure?  </p>

<p>It would be helpful if someone could give an answer that explains how hub-based meters like the PowerTap differ from the crank-based meters like the Quarq which differ from the other ones.  </p>
","<p>There are several different types of power meter on the market and each measures something slightly different in order to make their estimates. In addition, the way that they measure what they measure has implications for their accuracy. Below I discuss what the major models measure, how they measure it, and the implications for accuracy. </p>

<p>Power is the rate of work (so you need to know the amount of work and the span of time over which that work is done), and work is a force exerted over a distance, so each power meter has a different way to measure those forces and, because of patents, each has chosen to measure them in a different ""location."" </p>

<p>With the exception of the iBike, most power meters measure the forces somewhere along the drivetrain: working from the back to the front, the PowerTap (and the old Look MaxOne) measures at the rear hub, the older Polar systems measured along the chain, the Quarq, SRM, Rotor, and Power2Max measure at the spider of the front chain ring, the new Look/Polar and Garmin Metrigear (thus far, announced but unreleased) measure at the pedal spindle, the (announced but unreleased) Brim Brothers measures at the shoe cleat, the Ergomo measured at the bottom bracket, and the Stages measures at the left crank. The iBike measures in a completely different way, discussed below. One consequence of measuring at various points along the drivetrain is that drivetrain losses will (or won't) be accounted for to a different degree; for example, a PowerTap will usually read lower than a SRM since one is ""upstream"" of most drivetrain losses while the other is ""downstream."" This difference is more of a definitional issue than a strict ""accuracy"" issue (in the sense of, ""is gross income or net income a more 'accurate' measure of income?"" Unless you have a specific use in mind, it's hard to say which is more ""accurate"").</p>

<p>Most of the power meters on the market use strain gages, which are small thin foil strips whose electrical conductance and resistance varies as they are deformed. Strain gages are used in lots of applications (like, bridges) and their properties are well-understood. In general, strain gages are combined in a ""rosette"" or ""Wheatstone bridge"" in order to produce more accuracy and precision (more strain gages usually produce better results), and, when operating properly the Power Tap, Quarq, and SRM are usually accurate to within a couple percent (and, just as importantly, with high precision); this has been verified both statically (using known weights hung from the crank) and also dynamically (using a large powered rolling drum in a lab). The forces are then combined with a measurement of angular velocity or speed to get power. A virtue of strain gages is that the change in resistance can be measured even when the device is stationary so the cyclist can measure the accuracy of the strain-gage-based power meters at home by hanging weights of a known mass from the crank. A common problem with the strain gage approach, however, is that they can be sensitive to changes in temperature and so need to be ""re-zeroed"" prior to (and sometimes, during) rides. The old Look MaxOne's achilles heel was waterproofness, not the strain gages or method of measurement. For example, the original Power2Max (and the old discontinued SRM ""Amateur"" model) uses fewer strain gages than the current PowerTap, Quarq, or SRM models and reports from users (subsequently admitted to by the manufacturer) showed that it was more sensitive to temperature drift during a ride than those others. The Power2Max was redesigned and updated in late 2012 and reports are that the temperature problem has been largely addressed. A claimed feature of the Stages is that it is designed around automatic temperature compensation&nbsp;— as of early 2013 this claim is still being evaluated by users and it is too early to know if their approach does what it claims. </p>

<p>The old Polar power meter measured the force transmitted along the chain by chain tension, and included a chain speed sensor to get total work. In a chain higher force transmitted along the chain results in higher tension, and tension can be measured by the resonant frequency of the object (for example, plucking a highly-tensioned spoke with your fingernail produces a high frequency tone while plucking a loose spoke produces a low tone). As an historical aside, the proof-of-concept prototype for the Polar chain tension sensor was the pickup from an electric guitar. The chain speed sensor fit on one of the derailleur jockey wheels and could count the ""pulses"" in the magnetic field as the chain rivets passed; since chain rivets are a known distance apart, chain speed was easily calculated. As for accuracy, when the Polar was operating well, it was very good; however, when it wasn't it was very naughty indeed. Worse, it was often hard to tell when it was being naughty. The downfall of the old Polar power meter was three-fold: 1) the chain tension sensor needed to be close to the chain, which was hard to achieve since the chain sometimes had to be in the large or small chain ring or the large or small rear cog; 2) the chainspeed sensor sometimes got overwhelmed and gave false speed readings; and 3) incomplete weatherproofness in part due to exposed wires and a poorly sealed ""pod."" </p>

<p>The Ergomo bottom-bracket based power meter used an optical sensor and a series of ""peek holes"" to measure torsion in the bottom bracket. An odd characteristic of this design is that it could only measure the (torsional) force traveling through the bottom bracket; thus, it only measured the power contributed by the left leg: to get total power it doubled the left-leg contribution. In conjunction with the difficulty in installing and calibrating the Ergomo (it had to be installed <em>just exactly so</em>), this dependence on bilateral symmetry between the legs was the death knell for the Ergomo. The Stages power meter similarly measures force by deformation in the left crank, and doubles the ""left"" to arrive at an estimate of total power. Research with instrumented force pedals shows that bilateral asymmetry in power production between the right and left legs is the norm&nbsp;— worse, the research shows that the asymmetry can change with the level of effort. However, some riders are willing to accept this inherent inaccuracy and imprecision. </p>

<p>Because neither the old Polar nor Ergomo power meters used strain gages, their accuracy and precision could not be statically checked in the field by the cyclist; they could only be checked dynamically (or against anotheher known-calibrated power meter). </p>

<p>The unreleased Garmin Metrigear and Brim Brothers pedal or pedal cleat power meters are rumored to use piezoelectric sensors and solid state accelerometers rather than foil strain gages but until they reach the market all claims about accuracy or precision should be taken with grains of salt. An interesting problem in the design of a pedal- or cleat-based power meter is that the direction of force and the position of the pedal spindle must be known: for example, if you add downward force at the bottom of the pedal stroke, that is wasted force since it does not aid in moving the crank in the correct direction; likewise, if you press down (however slightly) on the upstroke, that will cancel out some of the force exerted by the other leg on its downstroke. Keeping track of the various force vectors is therefore key to getting reliable accuracy and precision. To some extent, the Stage power meter can also occasionally be susceptible to a related problem: the Stages uses a solid-state accelerometer in the pedal (similar to the solid-state accelerometers one can find in smart phones) to determine its position. Early production models of the Stages were plagued by imprecise measurements of pedal position, so pedal speed was also imprecise&nbsp;— and this had repercussions for the precision of the final power estimates.</p>

<p>The recently released (as of January 2012) Look/Polar power meter uses strain gages arrayed along the pedal spindle, and each pedal must be carefully installed so the pedals know which direction the forces are being applied -- a special tool is supplied with the pedals to help with the orientation. To simplify the conversion of measured forces to torque values, the Look/Polar pedal allows the use of only four different crank lengths: 170mm, 172.5mm, 175mm, and 177.5mm. Cranks shorter than 170mm are currently not supported. One pedal is the ""master"" and the other is the ""slave""; the slave pedal transmits information to the master which then bundles data from both pedals and forwards it to the head unit. At the moment, the Look/Polar pedal uses its own transmission protocol and no other manufacturer has yet signed on to provide compatible head units. Early reports on the new Look pedals confirm that the orientation of the pedals is critical: because the spindle of a pedal is small, a small absolute error in alignment can be a large relative error in its angular orientation. </p>

<p>The iBike takes a completely different approach: it calculates power indirectly. That is, you need a certain amount of power to overcome changes in potential energy (climbing or descending), for changes in kinetic energy (accelerating or decelerating), to overcome aerodynamic drag (including the wind) and drag from rolling resistance so if you know ground speed, gradient, wind speed, your total mass (you plus bike and all equipment) then combined with estimates of the coefficients of rolling resistance (Crr) and of aero drag and front surface area (CdA or drag area) you can calculate the overall power (see, for example, <a href=""http://content.lib.utah.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/ir-main&amp;CISOPTR=27505&amp;CISOMODE=print"">here</a>). In essence, the other power meters on the market focus on the ""supply side equation"" by measuring power supplied by the rider somewhere along the drivetrain; the iBike focuses on the ""demand side"" by measuring power demanded to move the bike against wind, gradient, and other drag forces. Under normal conditions, this can be quite (perhaps even surprisingly) accurate, though the precision of the power estimated in this way is not as good -- the iBike assumes that the aerodynamic drag area (aka CdA) is constant, so if the rider changes position (say, moving from the drops to the bar tops) or if the wind speed differs because the yaw angle changes, the power estimate will be off. In general, the iBike has been shown to be quite accurate for hill climbs; less so for rolling courses or riding in a pack, so the overall accuracy will depend on the exact mix of riding done and the variability in the direction of the wind. As with the non-strain gage based old Polar and Ergomo, the iBike cannot be statically checked for accuracy or precision; worse, nor can it be checked on a dynamic rig in a lab since it depends on gradient and wind speed. Checks of the iBike have been performed in the field when riders have mounted another power meter on the same bike and compared the two data streams.</p>

<p>There have been a few ""simultaneous"" comparisons of power meter accuracy where one rider mounted two or more power meters on the bike and went on structured or unstructured rides. You can see one such ""Rosetta Stone"" comparison <a href=""http://anonymous.coward.free.fr/wattage/rosetta/rosetta.html"">here</a> and <a href=""http://anonymous.coward.free.fr/wattage/rosetta/rosetta-details.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In general, all of the commercially released power meters have been accurate (and sometimes precise) when newly-adjusted and performing under ideal conditions. However, conditions are not always ideal and parts get damaged, dirty, and deteriorate. If accuracy and precision are important then the ""design"" accuracy (whether based on strain gages, optical sensors, magnetic sensors, or wind speed sensors) is only half the battle: equally important is the ability to verify a power meter at home so you can tell when they're off. </p>

<p>Using the bottle is okay, but stay away from using gasoline, kerosene, paint thinner or other harsh liquids.

"Will increased weight make me go downhill faster?","17896","","<p>I have had this question for a while. I want to know how I can get down a hill as fast as I can.

<p>I am talking long stretches here, and long, 10-30% hills. I have also checked the road surface, and there are no bends, and I can easily see if traffic comes along. It is very rarely used for traffic anyway.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT: I would also like to factor in things like rolling resistance in this question.</p>
","<p>The main thing you have to consider at speed is drag:
The force <em>F</em> on you+bike (mass <em>m</em>) is:</p>

<p><em>F</em> = <em>ma</em> = <em>mg</em> sin <em>Q</em> - <em>F_d</em> - <em>F_rr</em></p>

<p>where <em>a</em> is your acceleration, <em>g</em> is the acceleration due to gravity and <em>Q</em> is the hill angle to the horizontal. <em>F_d</em> is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drag force</a> which doesn't scale with mass. Try dropping a balloon and a (soccer) football of the same size and you'll see this in action. <em>F_rr</em> is the rolling resistance.</p>

<p>Drag dominates rolling resistance at any decent speed for a well-set-up bike: <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/9947/7309"">More detail than you probably want</a> or a <a href=""http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Science-Stories/Cycling-Aerodynamics/Sci-Media/Images/Power-needed-to-counter-aerodynamic-drag-and-rolling-resistance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nice graph</a> so you should be able to neglect rolling resistance.  </p>

<p>Weight will have a small effect on rolling resistance and (assuming it doesn't affect the cross-section) none on drag so it will make you accelerate faster but not by much.</p>

<p>You might want to experiment: start with some measured speeds with no extra load, then test the extra mass, and a dummy load of the same volume/shape/mounting made of polystyrene or cardboard.</p>

<p>The biggest effect you'll have is on the drag - so the first thing to try is a better tuck, not wearing flappy clothes, etc.</p>

<p>For really high speeds a fairing is the way to go - compare the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_record"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hour record</a> for a fully faired recumbant (~92km) with a UCI racing bike (~52km).

","<p>From Tom J. Stokes <a href=""http://www.tomjstokes.com/2010/09/21/choosing-a-mountain-bike-tire/"" rel=""noreferrer"">excellent article</a> on choosing tires:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wider tires tend to grip better during cornering and over rough terrain, at the expense of increased rolling resistance and weight. Wider tires will also float better in sandy conditions and are much more resistant to pinch flats when riding over sharp rocks or off of drops. For moderately rocky cross-country use, the sweet spot is between 2.0″ and 2.3″. If you primarily ride smooth hardpack or travel at a leisurely pace, choose a 2.0″ or even a 1.8″ tire. Likewise, if you tend to corner hard on the downhill and ride rough terrain, lean toward a 2.3″ tire. For downhill mountain biking where pedaling efficiency is less of an issue, look for a tire between 2.3″ and 2.6″. Tires up to 3.0″ wide are available, but rolling resistance becomes very significant past 2.6″.</p>
  
  <p>The front tire is typically subjected to more cornering forces than the rear tire. Likewise, the rear tire is usually loaded with more weight while pedaling. Consider using a wider tire in the front with a slightly narrower tire in the back to get the cornering benefits of a wider tire with the rolling resistance advantages of a narrower tire in the rear. I’ve had good luck with a 2.5″ tire up front with a 2.3″ tire in the rear on my downhill bike.</p>
  
  <p>Also note that widths are approximate. I’ve got a 2.3″ tire which measures 2.5″ wide with my calipers, and a 2.4″ tire which is actually only 2.25″ wide. Make sure that your frame and fork have enough clearance to support the width of the tire. Maximum tire sizes are listed in the owner’s manual. If you ride through mud often, allow for even more tire clearance to keep mud from building up between the tire and frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly though, the difference between a 2.1 and 2.3 is very small - I would just get the highest quality tire you can afford that is between those measurements. </p>

What parts of a bike are the most critical to get the torque just right? Is there a way to make sure the torque is ok without a torque wrench? I know what would happen if you don't tighten enough. Too tight is probably better than not tight enough!
Is there a way to make minor adjustments based on some sort of observation or feel?</p>
","<p>You can't approximate torque by feel. Loctite, grease, carbon compounds can all alter the 'feel' when you are tightening down bolts and if there was anyway to 'approximate the feel' these variables render it fairly impossible. </p>

<p>If you use ti/aluminum bolts, carbon components, high end aluminum do not cheap out, get the torque wrench. </p>

<p>If you tend towards stainless/steel bolts and less expensive components, you can forgo the torque wrench and just ensure you are working to even torque. For example, if it is a faceplate make sure that the gap between faceplate and stem is even all the way around.  </p>

<p>Saying 'too tight is better than not enough' is not true. Too tight can create stress risers in a component (specifically I am thinking handlebar) that can lead to catastrophic failure down the road. Too tight on a square taper crankset (specifically the fixing bolt) can cause deformation of the taper fit and eventual loosening of the crank. </p>

","<p>Trueing a wheel is something you can do on your own, but until you get good at it it'll take you time to do it right - ""carefully tighten the spokes on the opposite side..."" is kind of an oversimplification. Typically a trueing stand is used; the wheel is placed in the stand and prongs or arms on the stand determine exactly where the wheel is out of true.</p>

<p>The problem is that sometimes you need to loosen some spokes to get enough play to pull back against the deformation enough to straighten it out. Someone who does it all day makes it look easy - you bring your wheel in to a good bike shop and usually it takes longer for you to describe the pothole you whacked into than to actually true the wheel. If you've got a good relationship with them they may not even charge you for a 10 second job (karma would demand an offering of beer or pizza as appropriate).</p>

<p>If you don't have a trueing stand but you're feeling adventurous you could try doing it with the wheel in the frame - stand behind / in front of the wheel (so you're looking at the tread) and spin the wheel slowly - you should see where it comes out of true. Use an actual spoke wrench - if you use pliers you can round the ends of the spoke over and if you use a wrench you'll put too much torque on it (I have a friend who has done it with a leatherman in the middle of a ride but he also repaired and managed a bicycle store for many years). </p>

<p>Update - it wasn't the removable SRAM link, it was one of the factory links that broke. Because it had been skipping and the previous chain worn more than 100%, I asked to replace the chain and the cassette (even though he agreed that the cassette didn't look really worn, he said 5000 km is too far for a chain); and got a chain stretch measuring tool, if replacing the chain every 6 months isn't often enough. Anyway it's tight again now. The new chain is a more expensive SRAM PC-991 (which cost more than the new SRAM 950 cassette). The original parts I think were all Shimano.</p>
","<p>To keep your chain from breaking, keep the derailers properly aligned, ease off of pedaling when you shift, and don't ""stomp"" on the chain when it's not fully in gear.

<p>Seatposts/saddles: Probably interchangable</p>

<p>Forks: You wouldn't want to swap them, and chances are a beefy mountain fork wouldn't go into a road frame anyway, even if you could get the right headset.</p>

<p>Gearing: Road bikes typically have higher gearing than mountain bikes </p>

<p>There are larger chainrings on the crankset on a road bike - typically 52/39 or something or a 50/34 versus a big ring in the low 40s or 30s on a mountain bike. </p>

<p>The rear cassette is often smaller on a road bike as well (you won't see a 36t big rear cog on many road bikes, unless they're touring bikes).</p>

<p>Front derailleurs: FD's need to be shaped to the number of chainrings (typically 2, less so common 3 on a road bike vs often 3 on a mountain bike) as well as the size of the chainrings. For this reason (and in some cases the amount of cable pull needed to move the front derailleur) you can't mix road cranksets with mountain front derailleurs and mountain cranksets with road front derailleurs. On a mountain frame, you probably can't clear a road double if you were to mount it on, and you may have derailleur mounting issues when putting a mountain crankset on a road frame in some cases. </p>

<p>Rear derailleurs: Until 10 speed, you could swap them around when you stuck within the brand (then they introduced different cable pulls introducing shifter incompatibilites, so road shifters have to be paired with road derailleurs and similarly for mountain). The mountain rear derailleurs can shift larger rear cogs than road ones.</p>

<p>Cassettes: You can interchange them if you want in a lot of cases (touring road bikes often use big rear cogs). </p>

<p>Shifters: The front derailleur needs to be matched to road/mountain shifter. Rear derailleur will need to be matched if >=10 speed. Friction shifters always work.</p>

<p>Wheels: Mountain rims are often wider to support wider tires at lower pressures and are usually built to be more robust. Your hub widths are often the same, but mountain axles can cause compatibility issues (not just your usual QR) with different frames. Note 700c = 29"". Often wheels built for tougher road riding (e.g. touring) use mountain bike hubs. </p>

<p>Tires: Mountain tires are typically fatter than road tires. </p>

<p>Cables/Cable Housings: You can use the same types.</p>

<p>Handlebars: Mountain and Road bars have different diameters, so brake levers and shifters designed for one will not fit on the other.</p>

<p>Brakes: Typically, road brakes (mechanical disc brakes for road, caliper brakes, cantilever brakes) are short pull while mountain brakes are often long pull (v-brakes, mechanical disc brakes). This means you require a travel agent or special levers to run v-brakes or certain mechanical disc brakes on a road bike. Hydraulic systems are quite new on road bikes. Since you can't mount the levers onto a mountain bar, exchanging them is somewhat moot at this point. </p>

<p>Racks+fenders: These are wheel size and disc/not disc specific. Read the directions on the rack+fenders. </p>

<p>Generally, road stuff is lighter than mountain stuff. Probably less durable in a crash though. </p>

<hr>

<p>Now to part 2 of the question: What can you change on a bike to improve your commute? This question has been asked on SE a bunch of times, but typically the answer for commuting on a mountain bike is to lock out your suspension if you can (or switch to a rigid fork) and fit slick tires. You could also try a smaller cassette if you want, but other than that, you're going to want to get a new bike. If you have a road bike, you sometimes will want to fit a big cassette so you have lower gears available (you may need a new chain, and to make sure all the capacities of the derailleurs are within spec, else you may need a new rear derailleur) and bigger tires to make things more comfortable. </p>

Also, do I need a different tube for these tyres?</p>

<p>My goal is to do some dry trail mountain biking.</p>

<p>Lots of question. Thank you</p>
","<p>There's a bunch of weird standards for naming the size of tires and rims, and there's an actual ISO standard.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is ignore the big letter printed names that have inconsistent conventions, and look for the ISO standard stuff, like ""42-622"".</p>

<p>The ISO standard size of your tires and rims is 622.  (18mm wide rim and 42mm wide tire)</p>

<p>ISO 622 is the same as ""700c"" (common road size) and 29er (new larger mountain tire).</p>

<p>In other words: yes, a 29"" tire should work fine, as long as it's not too wide. </p>

<p>Try to stick with something close to the same width and they'll work fine with your existing rims. Mountain (off-road) tires with their knobs can require more clearance at the same size.</p>

<p>As long as you keep to about the same size tire, your existing tubes should be fine.</p>

"What exercise should I do in the gym to assist with hill-climbing?","17087","","<p>I have a few events coming up this year which have a fair amount of climbing (one is over a hundred miles with about 6500ft of ascent - that's an average of just over 1% for the entire distance). Obviously the best training is to get out and ride hills, again and again, but what recommendations are there for gym exercises to help? </p>

<p>I have access at work to a reasonably well equipped gym (a decent selection of weights machines and a small amount of free weight equipment). I haven't actually used it much - I used to do a sport which demanded a lot of time on the weights and since stopping regular training for that I've been enjoying not having to push any iron. So my imagination for weights is a little rusty. </p>

<p>So what would you suggest as good exercises in the gym to improve climbing capabilities? </p>
","<p>In many ways this needs to be individualized. My experience has been in century type rides during the summers over the last 15 years. Most of which are in hilly and mountainous regions in Oregon and Washington. The suggestions following are what I have refined during that period based on experience and significant reading on the subject. Additionally, I work part time as a fitness trainer, and have helped others train for centuries. </p>

<p>During the off-season, which for me runs from November through February, my primary goals in the gym are strength, power and stability. After February, the gym work is minimal and training shifts to riding. I can't provide a complete description here, but here's a summary of my program related to climbing ability. </p>

<ol>
<li>Strength - The key exercises are lunges, squats and rack-pulls. These exercises utilize free weights, build strength and work the entire lower body. Additionally, since they're done with free weights, you achieve improvements in core stability and balance. In general, these are done with heavy weight, 5 reps and 3 or 4 sets. A hugely important aspect is correct form in order to avoid injury.</li>
<li>Power - Power exercises are for developing explosive ability and speed. An example would be when you need an extra burst on a steep section of a hill. Also known as plyometrics. Here's a link to the basic idea: <a href=""http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/plyometricexercises.html"">http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/plyometricexercises.html</a></li>
<li>Stability - These exercises are designed to improve stability and utilize body weight and/or light weights. Split squat, medicine ball squat, single-leg Romanian deadlift, ball squat, crossover step-up, side-lying leg lifts. (FWIW - I have virtually eliminated an ITBS issue with this stability workout.) For each of these it's 3 sets, 10 reps. </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, during the course of the off-season I am cycling through these strength, power and stability workouts. For myself it's approximately 60% strength, 20% power, and 20% stability. How one cycles through these workouts is highly individualistic and is based on goals and one's fitness level. For example, in the last 3 weeks, I've done strength work on Monday and Friday with plyometrics on Wednesday. And next week will be 3 or 4 stability workouts.</p>

<p>The next planned century is in mid May. In March, I'll drop the strength and power training and move to almost exclusively to ""on bike"" training. The guide I follow pretty closely is <em><a href=""http://www.velopress.com/cycling.php?id=284"">The Time-Crunched Cyclis</a>t</em> by Chris Carmichael and Jim Rutberg.</p>

<p><em>And just a note...the workout plan is not specifically and only for hill climbing. Through experience, I've found that the stronger I am going into the ""season"", the better I perform.</em> Additionally, my other sports and daily living activities are improved as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>An update</em></strong>...not to belabor <em>The Time-Crunched Cyclist</em>, but both I and riding partners have significantly improved our personal performance on hilly to mountainous century rides using Carmichael's methods. There are 3 types of intervals specific to climbing improvement. Not the full details, but a summary. Mix these into your training rides. Generally, not all three on the same day, and not on consecutive days; but these intervals once or twice a week should yield results. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Climbing Repeats - Done a long, steady climb. Staying within 78 - 80% of Max Heart Rate for the climb with a cadence of 70 - 85 rpm. This increases climbing lactate threshold. (3X, 6 minutes each, 3 minute rest between)</p></li>
<li><p>Hill Acceleration - On a long, moderate climb, pedal slowly until reaching the last 500 yards. Then gradually speed up so that you are at near max heart rate. Finish out of the saddle at max effort. (4X, 10 seconds, 3 minute rest between)</p></li>
<li><p>Hill Sprint - Roll at a moderate speed in a moderate to light gear. As you hit the hill, jump out of the saddle and go hard. Try to hold top speed. Increases power for acceleration. (4X, 10 seconds, 3 minute rest between) </p></li>

"Pins and needles in my fingers after long rides","17085","","<p>I've started to get pins and needles in my little finger and the finger next to it some times after riding for over an hour. The roads are quite rough and vibrate my handle bars quite a lot. I also wake up some mornings with tingley fingers. I think that might be related to cycling, but it could also be that my fingers spend a lot of time typing.</p>

<p>Is this something that I should be worried about and is there anything I can do to prevent it happening?</p>
","<p><strong>Talk to a doctor</strong></p>

<p>The symptoms of waking up with tingly fingers make this sound consistent with <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001469/"">carpal tunnel syndrome</a> to my non-doctor opinion.</p>

<p>Basically, as I understand it, a little bit of that now and then isn't a problem, but too much over time causes damage which can be permanent and cause some major hand problems.</p>

<p>There's a bundle of nerves and tendons that run through a narrow channel in your wrist. Pressure on that area, or using the tendons with the wrist in a non-neutral position can, over time cause problems. That can mean biking and typing are causing you trouble. Pressure on these nerves will tend to cause numbness and tingling in the thumb, index, middle and part of your ring finger. Vibration of the hands (such as from rough ground) could be the main problem instead of pressure.</p>

<p>There's also the ulnar nerve on the ""pinky"" side of your hand that can have the same kind of problems.  Pressure on this nerve (or stretching/hyperextension) will tend to cause numbness and tingling in the pinky finger and part of your ring finger.</p>

<p>Diagnosing exactly which problem you have is best done by a doctor, not the internet.</p>

<p>Assuming you talk to your doctor and they suggest avoiding the hand pressure your bike is causing, some things to help avoid these problems on your bike include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a professional bike fitting</li>
<li>Don't hold the bars tightly, hold them loosely</li>
<li>Gloves with padding matching the pads of your palm (no pad on central channel, that will make things worse).  Sadly many gloves aren't really designed to help, so you have to know what to look for.</li>
<li>Some bar grips are designed to help</li>
<li>Changing how you ride to put less pressure on your hand (use core muscles to hold body up)</li>
<li>Raise handlebars and/or move them closer to you so that you have less pressure on your hands</li>
<li>Handlebar ends to give more hand positions</li>
<li>Different style handlebars (new bike with drop bars?) for more hand positions, preferably with main position not putting pressure in center of palm</li>
<li>Vary your hand positions more often.  If you have bars that allow multiple hand positions, use them.</li>
<li>Take breaks during your ride.  Even just taking your hands off the bars for a minute at a stop light could help.</li>
<li>There may be stretches you can do during such breaks to help</li>
<li>Pedal harder/faster. If you pedal hard enough, you'll find yourself pulling your body down with the handlebars instead of pressing down on your hands.</li>
<li>Run your tires at a lower pressure. Replace with fatter tires if necessary. This should help reduce road vibration.</li>
</ol>

"What's the efficiency of hub gears compared to derailleurs?","17057","","<p>What's the efficiency of hub gears compared to derailleurs? I know that hub gears are not as efficient. Apart from being heavier, how much will I lose in performance if I use hub gears?</p>
","<p>A lot depends on the rider and <strong>what you mean by efficiency</strong>.</p>

<p>It is easy to keep a hub gear running well for years, but an unmaintained derailleur will become inefficient very quickly.  A hub gear allows the chain to be fully enclosed, for all but the most dedicated cyclist; an enclosed chain will be more efficient as it will be cleaner and better oiled.</p>

<p>An enclose chain allows you to arrive at work, with clean cloths and no need to change, this can save lots of time.  Not having to spend time adjusting a derailleur or cleaning your chain also increase the efficiency of your life.
However it takes longer to remove the wheel if you have hub gears and an enclosed chain.</p>

<p>Personally I think on a road bike:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hub gears are more efficient if you wish to use a bike to make lot of short trips as part of your <strong>day to day life</strong>.</li>
<li>But derailleurs are more efficient if you consider <strong>going fast on a bike to be very important</strong> and are willing to put the work into the bike that is needed to keep it in a very good state of maintenance.</li>

<p>The purpose of my bike is going to be able to do long distance mainly. I cannot afford another bike for racing but I will most probably be doing Ironman from next year using the same bike. But I personally think that riding 180 km in 8 hr is endurance and not year.</p>

<p>Now which size should I go for?  <strong>52 or 54</strong>?<br>
Should I just check the standover height of the bike? Or I should I look into something more than that?</p>

<p>I am asking this because in India not many shops deal with Trek road bikes. The Trek 1.2 is only available at one shop. That fellow says he <strong>won't</strong> allow me to test ride the bike. So I am in a bad situation. I want to buy this bike but the right size. The whole geometry is available in the site I have given. Ask for more information, if needed.</p>
","<p>I think you could ride either size comfortably. You may need to change the stem to accommodate your longer reach, but the range of adjustment for the seat is what you want to look at, not so much the seat tube length. When you look at sizing, the reach is as important as the height. But good fit can be achieved within a range of values; I think it is better to think of proper fit as a range of values rather than a point estimate.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TPCFJ.jpg"" alt=""measurement diagram""></p>

","<p>I think a road bike gives you better efficiency so you can go further with less energy and do it quicker. This is because they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lighter - Less mass to get up to speed and keep moving.</li>
<li>More rigid - less flex, so the bike itself absorbs less pedal energy, meaning when you pedal, more of that energy is used to propel you forwards.</li>
<li>Less suspension, as suspension on a mountain bike works by moving oil/air around, and that warms up - you're providing the energy to warm the suspension up instead of moving forwards.</li>
<li>Have higher gears, so you can go further for one revolution of the pedals.</li>
<li>Have thinner tires - For less contact and friction with the road that would slow you down.</li>
<li>Have higher pressure tires - So they squish less and don't use up energy.</li>
<li>Get you in a more aerodynamic position so you incur less wind resistance. But, this might mean you feel less comfortable.</li>

<p>What are the techniques to improve cadence? I am not targeting this question to touring or long-distance but for endurance-riding, meaning training for longer-distance with higher HF and higher speed. I like to do short repetitions for about 10 minutes with high rpm above 120 but I am not sure whether it is ideal and I am not sure how much resistance I should add during such periods. What kind of exercises do you do? The exercises do not necessarily need to be even on bike, as long as they meet the goal to train endurance-riding with higher cadence over longer time.</p>

</ol>
","<p>A good option may be interval training...which extends well beyond cadence in effect...</p>

<p>Some background first:</p>

<ul>
<li>High cadence in an ""easy"" gear means that you are primarily taxing your cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Basically, this is aerobic activity in which one can engage for long periods of time. </li>
<li>Low cadence in a ""hard"" gear means that you are taxing the skeletal muscles such as the quads, hamstrings and glutes, etc. Since you are using a bigger gear you're relying more on what is commonly called the anaerobic energy system. </li>
</ul>

<p>The gist of higher cadence riding is that your heart and lungs can take repeated punishment for long periods of time (and they recover quickly after hard efforts,) while your muscles will fatigue relatively quickly and recover more slowly.</p>

<p>So, since your training goal is to boost your average cadence, an effective method for improvement is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training"">interval training</a>. </p>

  <p>...a type of physical training that involves bursts of high-intensity work interspersed with periods of low-intensity work. The high-intensity periods are typically at or close to near-maximum exertion, while the recovery periods may involve either complete rest or activity of lower intensity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are at least several forms of structured interval training programs such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fartlek"">Fartlek</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training#Tabata_Method"">Tabata</a>, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1934030473"">Chris Carmichael's Time Crunched Cyclist</a>, as well as other well known cycling coaches. So, to train for cadence, you'd pick a method; and <strong><em>you would alternate low cadence (low intensity) with high cadence (high intensity) for the intervals</em></strong>. By diligently following an interval training program, you would probably see improvements in your average cadence in a relatively short period of time (1 - 2 months).   </p>

<p>Without knowing more about your specific current conditioning, I cannot offer a particular plan; however, I and others have had great results with the Chris Carmichael method. And a nice quote by Carmichael from his book (p.42):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind, however, that there's no magical cadence everyone should shoot for. Rather than aim for a specific number, I recommend athletes try to increase their normal cruising cadence and climbing cadence by 10% in a year (with the understanding that very few cyclists can ride effectively at sustained cadences above 120 to 125 rpm on flat ground). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note one: Cadence training is much easier with a cycling computer that monitors cadence.</em></p>

<p><em>Note two: Interval training is difficult and should only be done 1 - 3 days per week and not on sequential days.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>After taking a look</em></strong> at Joe Friel's blog via the link provided by <em>Dana the Sane</em>, I noticed that <a href=""http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2011/07/intervals-part-1.html"">Joe Friel has an excellent 5 part article on Interval Training</a>. A quote from the <a href=""http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2011/08/intervals-part-4.html"">Joe Friel article on Interval Training, Part 4</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speed skills sessions are intended to improve efficiency by improving movement skills. This usually involves doing drills to refine or learn a technique. Drills are common in swimming. <strong><em>A typical cycling drill is to increase the pedaling cadence in a low gear to a max level for a few seconds every few minutes while relaxing the body.</em></strong> Runners do “strides” workouts in which they run fast, usually down a slight hill, while focusing on one aspect of technique such as foot position at strike. There many, many drills for each sport.</p>

"Can someone give me a short description and comparison of the different road cycling pedal / shoe systems?","16985","","<p>I am looking at buying a pedal/shoe system as the clips and straps I am using are hurting my feet again.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I have bought a road pedal / shoe system, and I have forgotten the differences between SPDs, Look pedals and all the others.  </p>

<p>Can someone give a short comparison of each pedal system with pros and cons of each? My usage is/will be mainly city street cycling and then road cycling (recreation, not racing).</p>

<p>I'd prefer if people would give the pros and cons of each and not their opinion on the ""pedal system war"".  :) However, ""I use them because I find XYZ and it helps in ABC ways"" is very useful.</p>
","<p>First up, I'd strongly recommend switching to clipless pedals. I had the same discomfort issues you're describing with normal shoes and toeclips and find clipless pedal so much more comfortable and secure (therefore safer).</p>

<p>When comparing and evaluating clipless pedal systems, some of the more important attributes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Float - This is the property where the foot can swivel on the pedal while clipped in. Some pedals allow the float to be adjusted independently of the tightness, while other pedals have only a single adjustment for both. Also, see <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/845/clipless-pedals-float"">this answer</a>.</li>
<li>Ease of entry - Some pedals require the pedal and cleat to be lined up carefully before the cleat can clip in. Others are orientation agnostic and a good stomp is usually enough to engage the cleat.</li>
<li>Compatibility with shoes - Most shoes have either the 2 bolt SPD pattern (typically mountain bike and more casual style shoes) or the 3 bolt SPD-SL pattern (typically lighter and more stripped down road shoes)</li>
<li>Availability - How easy it is to buy parts, cleats and pedals.</li>
<li>Surface area - The size of the contact point on the shoe. This can make a difference in how evenly the pressure of the pedal is distributed to the foot.</li>
<li>Walkability - How easy it is to walk while wearing the shoe with the cleat.</li>
</ul>

<p>These attributes for a number of different brands are compared in the table below.

"How do the adjustment barrels on a gear cable work?","16978","","<p>I have a Shimano Sora derailleur on the bike I just bought with a triple chainring in the front. Right up by the shifters there is a sort of barrel adjuster on the cable. It doesn't seem to do anything when twiddled. When I was fiddling with the adjustment at the other end, and disconnected the whole cable by accident, this adjuster was separated from the cable covers on each side. I couldn't figure out at all how it was supposed to work. There didn't seem to be any threads, or screw mechanism to make it grow or shrink when adjusted. Yet it clearly does something. Can anyone explain what, and how?</p>
","<p>Your basic barrel adjuster is a tube with a thread on the outside of one end.  The threaded end fits into a female threaded piece, either the shifter itself or another tube.  (If you have this second type, where the female end is another tube, it's necessary to hold that second tube stationary while turning the first tube.)</p>

<p>The cable passes through the tube, and the cable housing ""bumps into"" the end of the adjuster barrel (which generally has a sort of ""cup"" sized to accept the housing and keep it centered).</p>

<p>The adjuster works this way:  As you UNSCREW the adjuster, it pushes the cable housing farther out, effectively tightening the cable.  The cable is held in tension by the spring in the derailer, so this adjustment moves the position of the far end of the cable relative to the derailer.</p>

<p>[Note that some adjusters have a thin ""jam nut"" on the threaded portion of the barrel, and this is tightened against the female piece to keep the adjuster from turning.  It's often necessary to unscrew this jam nut slightly before working the adjuster.]</p>

<p>Note that once you've unscrewed the adjuster beyond the end of the threads it won't tighten the cable anymore, but will just spin.  If this occurs (before satisfactory adjustment is achieved) it's necessary to screw the adjuster all the way in, loosen the cable clamp at the derailer, and pull it a hair tighter.</p>

<p>Also, if some jackleg in the past decided to ""tighten things"" with a pair of pliers they may have broken off the threaded portion inside the female portion, rendering the adjuster completely ineffective.</p>

"Do glueless tube patches work as well as glue ones?","16956","","<p>Quite a few years ago I tried some glueless patches for repairing my punctured tubes while out on the road, and found that they rarely stayed on for very long.  I know that technology has advanced a lot since then, and I am wondering if I should now try them again?  Do they work?</p>
","<p>They work ok - if you are just riding around town, they would probably be fine. If you are on a ride out in the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't count on these. The ones with glue work significantly better, to the point where I wouldn't buy the glue-less ones.</p>

","<p>I assume you mean the quick release skewer and the answer is no, well at least not in my experience. I've spent a few years riding on the training skewer from my Tacx trainer and had no issues outside of the visual detraction of a silver skewer on black rims/wheels.</p>

"What is the benefit of a larger disc rotor?","16885","","<p>What real benefit does having a larger rotor give to braking performance?</p>

<p>Additionally is my assumption correct that you callipers don't actually change in size, just the rotor and the adapter need to be be changed?</p>

<p>And for the bonus point while I'm here, what benefit does moving to a 4 pot system give over a standard (2 piston) calliper?</p>
","<p>Simply put a bigger rotor provided better braking, and a four pot caliper provides better braking - better meaning more, and more control (Everything else being equal). </p>

<p>For the same force between the disc and pads, a bigger rotor generates more torque on the wheel - i.e. more stopping force. It is running though the pads faster, generating more friction for the same pressure, more stopping power, and as it has bigger surface area, is dissipating more of the generated heat, meaning the disc and pads run colder. So, for the same caliper and brake pad, a bigger rotor generates more braking for the same pressure or the same amount of braking for less pressure. </p>

<p>The disadvantage of a bigger rotor is weight and as its larger, more prone to warping and distortion. </p>

<p>This applies to all disc brakes from bicycles to aircraft...... </p>

<p>For a bicycle, there comes a time where you have ""enough"", and quickly get to ""too much"" - with high quality equipment its a surprisingly small disk for most people. Big disks a more prone to warping and damage, which is a good reason not install them unless you need to.</p>

<p>Heat buildup is not normally a problem but low end pads can suffer fad. Small rotors don't typically over heat on bikes (Tandems and loaded tourers might manage it). The main advantage is more breaking for less pressure - so you get more control and feel, and your braking hand tires less (If you have ever done a 1000ft vertical descent in technical tracks on crap brakes you know the feeling) </p>

<p>A 4 pot caliper provides advantages of more and more even pressure, meaning better braking. Also as there are usually larger pads - more heat dissipation can be achieved.  </p>

<p>Note: A 29'er would usually need a bigger disc than a 26"" wheel for the same stopping power. </p>

<p>Don't forget the pad and disk material - these can make a bigger difference than size, but its not as visible. Do not go to big discs and 4 pots unless you are already at the higher end of the quality spectrum.</p>

<p>Edit: I recently saw some discussion regard discs on road bikes, and some basic physics indicate over heating is a major problem with hydraulic disc brakes and descending large heights (100's of meters vertical) causing the fluid to boil. Extra cooling from a larger rotor would help, but is likely to be just a small part of the answer.  </p>

"Major differences between Hardtail and Full Suspension mtn bikes","16858","","<p>I'm curious as to the big differences in the feel and ride of a hardtail vs a full suspension mountain bike. Also, which types of riding/trails are each better suited for?</p>
","<p>It is as simple as full suspension feels like suspension on both wheels and hard tail feels like the front only.  </p>

<p>Use the full suspension for more and bigger bumps.<br>
Also for landing jumps.  </p>

<p>The hard tail is lighter and the pedal action is more efficient.<br>
The frame is stiffer laterally (more efficient).<br>
The rear shock on a full suspension will absorb part of the pedal energy (very little as it is designed to minimize this).<br>
For lighter bumps.<br>
The tail will get bounced around (much) more than full suspension.<br>
Bouncing a real wheel is typically not going to drop you but you are not getting traction.  </p>

<p>You will typically see downhill riders on full suspension.</p>

<p>On single track it goes both ways.<br>
Your preference and the nature of the single track.</p>

<p>Trials riders will ride hardtail.</p>

<p>Some tricks like a bunny hop are easier on a hardtail (I think). </p>

<p>If you are learning technique then I would go hard tail as it more forces you to pick a line.  </p>

<p>If you want to bang through some ruff stuff then full suspension.  </p>

<p>Tend to take harder falls on a full suspension as you can go faster on the bumps.<br>
And when those bumps are rocks it hurts.<br>
And when you ding a $1500 frame it stings.  </p>

<p>If you are going to get full suspension then get a good one.  </p>

<p>In looking at cost and weight of FRAME ONLY.<br>
I am going to compare Niner as that is what I ride and what I know best.<br>
Hard tail frame: Ross 9 large frame weighs 1,680g and retail list for $899<br>
Soft tail frame: Jet 9 large frame weighs 2,980 and retail list is $1849<br>
Now those are higher end frames and the difference is $1000 and 3 lbs<br>
On the mid range the difference might be $400<br>
Don't buy a low end full suspension!    </p>

<p>My two cents:<br>
Don't buy full suspension for your first mountain bike<br>
Learn technique on a hard tail<br>
There are lots of times when you going to want to ride a hard tail<br>
Make it your second bike and be ready to spend some coin<br>
The guys and girls riding a full suspension for what it is are good and are on $3000+ bikes  </p>

<p>My three cents:<br>
Upgrade your hard tail to tubeless and go 2.25 (or 2.4 in the rear if you can) in the rear<br>
Not the same but at lower pressure you get less bounce (for NO weight)<br>
And you get the grip of conforming to rocks and roots<br>
And you get no pinch flats<br>
For less weight than the full suspension    </p>

<p>I have about a month to break in the saddle. </p>

<p><strong>How long should I spend breaking a brooks b17 before taking it on a touring trip?</strong> </p>

<p>Any tips to speed it up?</p>
","<p>There is a lot of complete and utter non-sense around Brooks saddles. When it comes to saddles, everything works for somebody and nothing works for everybody. </p>

<p>Rule #1. If it's not reasonably comfortable on Day 1, it will never be comfortable. </p>

<p>Saddle comfort is about getting the right shape to match your backside, leather saddles like the Brooks will break in and get more comfortable over time, but they won't significantly change shape. If you have the wrong shaped Brooks, it will never ""break in"" and get comfortable. </p>

<p>A month is not long enough to significantly change a Brooks saddle. But if it's working for you now, it will be working better for you in a month. </p>

<p>Brooks gets a lot of good press because they are wider than typical road saddles and thus for many people it's the first saddle they've used that actually fits them. However, if your Brooks doesn't fit, it's just a heavy, expensive source of pain. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CKij8.jpg"" alt=""inline brakes""></p>

<p>I've been having trouble with braking performance, particularly in the wet. The levers don't bottom out (as I'm careful to keep them adjusted), but even squeezing very hard the bike doesn't pull up very quickly. I should also mention that I've tried removing each lever and haven't noticed any difference (although it can be hard to compare different days and different conditions).</p>

<p>I've had 3 different bike shops tell me that the problem is having both brake levers. They claim that it introduces too much flex into the system and braking power is reduced. I was very skeptical until all 3 people told me the same story independently.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me. The cable is not interrupted and using either lever doesn't seem to compromise the brake line in any way. When you use the bar end lever, the interrupter is closed and I can't see any flex in the lever. When using the interrupter lever I don't see how the bar end lever can be causing any flex either.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain how having both levers would compromise performance?</p>
","<p>The problem is not to do with the interrupter levers (they are probably the least weak part), the problem is systematic.</p>

<p>Shimano and Campagnolo are known for their bike components, however, they can be seen as companies specializing in cold forged aluminium alloy components and able to churn out the best quality stuff, whether that be fishing reels, wheels for Porsche cars or bike bits. These companies have invested in really big presses for the cold forging process, invested in the finest alloys and invested in the really expensive dies that only make sense to invest in if the sales volume is there.</p>

<p>Only engineers inside the machine tool/cold-forging business or in the cold-forging business can really illuminate to you the science going on at the high end and what the likes of 'Tektro' miss out on. However, 'Tektro' parts are nearer being 'stamped out of cheese' than cold-forged properly. It is unlikely that their parts get put in the press multiple times, this forging process required to give the 'Shimano grade' finish, aligned aluminium alloy grains and consequent strength.</p>

<p>The Tektro brakes are well known for being 'spongy' and, as of yet, no Tour de France teams upgraded their Campagnolo/SRAM/Shimano brakes to 'Tektro' for that special 'spongy' feel. They are OEM parts without much call for them in the aftermarket. The processes used to make all of their parts are cheaper than those used by Shimano/Campagnolo. Hence the problem is systematic.</p>

<p>Given where you are, consider getting a better front brake, e.g. Shimano 105 (or even Sora). Also consider investing in Shimano cables. The back brake is less crucial as you skid on that anyway, but you might want to be on the lookout for a complete brake setup replacement <em>minus</em> the interrupter levers - keep them and swap out the rest as time and effort allows.</p>

","<p>For the most part, bicycles have terrible resale value, which means that you can usually get a really good deal on a used bike.

That said, inspect for obvious signs of wear (there should be almost none), and see if you can find out why the bike is being sold.</p>

<li>Schwalbe's balloon bike concept in general <a href=""http://www.balloonbikes.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.balloonbikes.com/en/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>I have been riding a Cannondale Headshock bike for commuting and touring in the last ten years, and I loved the front suspension. I find it softer on the hands/wrists, especially on long rides. If the suspension is off, and I ride a full day, my hands get much more tired, vs. with the suspension on. Handwriting for example is much harder after a long day of riding, with suspension off.</p>

<p>I had zero issues with the fork, functions since 2004 without issues. I do have a front rack, too. The bike has wide tires (IRC Lover Soul, 26x2.25).</p>

<p>So it seems the benefits are there, there are no maintenance issues (was serviced regularly), racks can be mounted on them, and cost in the upper segment shouldn't be an issue. And the top touring bikes are still offered without front suspension. Why?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Let me ask again: my question is NOT about the pros and cons of using a suspension fork in touring in general, or whether you think I need it or not, or what is my definition of a touring bike, or whether there are touring bikes with suspension or not (there's a lot of them). </p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p><strong>Why is that while many middle range touring bikes are with front suspension (1000-2000 Euro bikes), then most of the TOP of the line touring models (4000 Euro and above) are without?</strong></p>

<p>My logic would be that if it is offered in mid range, it's also offered on the top bikes, too.</p>

<p>See for example the range of Rose bikes, who are one of those manufacturers who sell among the highest number of touring bikes. Rose has 20 different <a href=""http://www.roseversand.de/produkte/fahrraeder/trekking-bikes/trekking---tourenraeder/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Tourenräder"" for 1000-2000 Euro</a>, so these middle range touring models are almost all with front suspension. If I look at Tout Terrain for example, from the 10 top of the range models, they only have two model with front suspension, the <a href=""http://www.tout-terrain.de/fahrraeder/panamericana-xplore/"" rel=""nofollow"">Panamericana</a>, and all the rest is fixed fork.</p>

<ul>
<li>Money: it is not a reason while these bikes are over 4000 Euro anyway, and mid range bikes are with suspension.</li>
<li>Ease of repair: I see not a reason while disc brakes, carbon drive, hydraulic brakes, XT derailleurs are equally fine machinery that need care, and difficult to repair on site. To me, the dérailleur is the most delicate part of any bike, it gets damaged during transport or hard terrain easily, and very difficult to repair. And anyway, parts can be delivered by DHL anywhere. And again, mid range bikes are with suspension.</li>
<li>Weight: these bikes are 15+kg, just the Schwalbe tyres are 700-800g each, the pack is around 20kg, so shaving off 200-300g from the bike weight doesn't matter.</li>
<li>Force: if a fork can withstand downhill, they should handle touring.</li>
</ul>

<p>So none of these justify why offer lots of mid-range touring bikes with suspension, and then the top range much less. </p>
","<p>I also have enjoyed riding with a Cannondale Headshok (Silk Tour 700).  I agree with you, weight and stiffness are non-issues with HeadShok type suspension, I think they are fantastic for producing a comfortable aluminium tourer but I may be biased!</p>

<p>I think that people who have not riden this type of shock don't understand its advantages.  When it is locked off it has almost zero effect on the stiffness of the front fork, and it allows carrying a normal front rack.  When it's on, it takes out corregations on rough roads and makes it possible to ride firetrails that are very rough while keeping the wheel in better contact.  </p>

<p>The last trek I did with this bike was over 2000km and I tried to stay off road as much as possible, carrying up to 35kg of gear.
These bikes are amazing and handle beautifully even fully loaded at speed (got up to 93km/h on one section!).</p>

<p>I think the reason why touring shocks are not more widespread is that normal suspension forks are useless on a touring bike (they are heavier than the headshok, harder to lock out and reduce stiffness).  As far as a I can tell, the HeadShok patent is still valid and very expensive to licence, so it's probably prohibitive for other manufacturers (although you're right that these bikes are not cheap anyway!).  </p>

<p>I am still looking for a Cannondale Touring Rohloff to eventually replace my Silk Tour 700, but they're seriously hard to find.  Also, I notice that Koga has a similar shock,  the Koga Feather Shock, for their high end tourers (look under front fork options at: <a href=""http://www.koga-signature.com/Build-Your-Own-Bike.aspx?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.koga-signature.com/Build-Your-Own-Bike.aspx?language=en</a>).  It's only got 35mm of travel (I think the newer Cannondale tourers have 50mm) and you can only fit 37mm tyres (my HeadShok fits 42mm+ comfortably).</p>

<p>My <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070815183720/http://www.cannondale.com/bikes/04/ce/model-4FSFF.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cannondale Badboy 2004</a> has a crack in the alu-frame. I was surprised by this, I thought my bike will last 20+ years easily. The workshop they said this is a high quality, strong frame, but after 10 years alu frames can get tired. Especially if I use my bike both in winter and summer, as the heat change wear alu faster. They say it can be welded, which will cost significantly less vs. a new frame (if it is available), but I should be prepared for other cracks to appear. The workshop contracts a welder specialized in bike frame welding and repair.</p>

<p>I also found a scientific research article on this topic. If someone has access to ScienceDirect (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630710001317"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cicero et al. (2011): <em>Analysis of the cracking causes in an aluminium alloy bike frame</a></em>), I'd be interested in the conclusions.</p>

<p>I'm interested in touring bikes, not road bikes, city bikes, etc.</p>

<p>I'm happy to update/clarify my question if needed, make a comment.</p>

<p><strong>Crack in the alu frame near the rear axe</strong> (the bike is upside down):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F66wb.jpg"" alt=""Crack near the rear axe""></p>
","<p>There are a lot of question so I will settle on the one in the title.  </p>

<p>How many years will an current aluminum frame last of a touring bike?  </p>

<p>Depends:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't know what aluminum frame<br>
Construction is a larger factor than material </li>
<li>Don't know the use<br>
Use is a larger factor than material</li>
<li>Don't know how you are going to care for the bike<br>
Care/maintenance is larger factor than material </li>
</ul>

<p>Aluminum has not changed in the 10 years </p>

<p>All we know is your last aluminum, high quality, strong frame bike lasted about 10 years   </p>

<p>The best guess is your next aluminum, high quality, strong frame will also last 10 years<br>
Really that is the best guess  </p>

<p>That is as vague as how long will a current pair of sneakers last me?<br>
And the best guess for how long my next pair of sneakers will last is how long did my last pair last.  </p>

<p>Aluminum fatigues and steel does not fatigue. 
As stated in a comment steel does fatigue - well not always. Mild steel will not normally admit fatigue crack growth if the applied stresses are below about 10% of the strength of the material. Materials, such as aluminium alloys, do not have any such fatigue limit. If a cyclic load is applied, aluminium alloys will always fatigue.  For the same strength a steel bike is typically going to be heavier than aluminum.  But you get a bike that is much much less susceptible to fatigue.  With steel you also get a bike that will take a ding (dent) and not compromise structural strength to the extent of aluminum. Not exactly the same thing but at the molecular level they are related. <a href=""http://www.rivbike.com/kb_results.asp?ID=29"">Frame Materials</a> </p>

<p>Found a quoted number.  Just because it was on the Internet does not make it right but here is a 5-10 year quote.<br>
<a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/87520-bike-frame-aluminum-vs.-steel/"">Bike Frame: Aluminum Vs. Steel</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aluminum frames possess the shortest fatigue life of any material used
  to manufacture bicycle frames. The typical aluminum frame possesses a
  life expectancy of five to 10 years. The fatigue life of steel is much
  longer, but the material requires more maintenance. To prevent rust
  formation steel frames must be cleaned and polished regularly and
  periodically coated with rust stop on the interior of the frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are discounting steel because it will rust then you are not caring for the bike properly.  A properly maintained and stored steel bike should not rust.  And for sure it should not rust out in your life time.   You stated bikes from you fathers era lasted 40-50 years - pretty sure they were steel bikes.</p>

<p>If you want fatigue free and rust free then get titanium.  </p>

"Safest way to slow down a bike quickly if both sets of brakes fail","16594","","<p>This may sound like a crazy question, however today in the wet my rear brakes decided to stop working effectively. It has been pouring rain here which makes the problem more apparent.</p>

<p>I managed to get to work unscathed, but was wondering what is the best technique if I were to get in a situation where I had no brakes (front or back) and was heading downhill.</p>

<p>Try and zig-zag; throw the bike and just take the worst of it early on; immediately turn sideways in one direction or roll into the gutter.</p>

<p>What is the most effective, least damaging and most safe effective way of doing this?</p>
","<p>BMXers in some places put the shoe between rear tire and frame, just where the rear brake normally is attached to the bike. I've never done that, because I used to run knobby tires (ouch!), and nowadays I care a lot about brakes.</p>

<p>You really should avoid this situation, because many times there would not be much to do.</p>

<p>I would guess, a good alternative would be to turn sharply while leaning the bike, and then skidding the rear tire sideways. That is already difficult to do in a planned way, what to say when you are frightened...</p>

<p>A good thing to do is follow the advice ""brake early, brake often"", so you don't have to find out your brakes are not working only when is already too late.</p>

"Can I get smaller tires without changing my rims?","16587","","<p>I currently ride a hybrid that came with 700x32c tires. Can I swap out a narrower tire without changing the rims, or do rims only fit a specific size of tire?   How small can I go before I have to buy new rims?  I hear having narrower tires makes you go quite a bit faster.  Does it really help that much?</p>
","<p>Most 700c rims will work with essentially any size of tire. Yes, smaller tires <em>generally</em> reduce rolling resistance a little, but unless you're road racing, it's rarely worth going below about 700x23c, IMO. Also note that just being smaller doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean lower rolling resistance -- one brand of 700x19c might have higher rolling resistance than another brand of 700x20c, for example.</p>

<p>The big change (if any) happens when you switch to slick tires (and most 700x32c tires have fairly substantial tread if not outright knobs).</p>

"How does a bike's weight affect the overall experience of owning it?","16578","","<p>Naturally, carrying a light bike up the stairs is much more enjoyable compared to a heavier bike. Are there any other aspects of a bike which are affected by its weight?</p>

<p>For example, would the weight affect handling at low speeds? Higher speeds? Turning? Stability in strong crosswinds, heavy rain or other adverse weather conditions?</p>

<p>What does the weight say about a modern bike's components? About its durability or dependability? Maintenance? Wear and tear?</p>

<p>Are lighter bikes always better? What would be a reasonable weight threshold below which gains are diminishing?</p>

<p>As an inexperienced cyclist looking for a new bike, I'm unsure how much I should be paying attention to its weight.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: what specific weight ranges should I be looking for these days? What would be considered very heavy, reasonable, and at what weight do we enter the multi-thousand-dollar pro racing bikes?</p>

<p>I found a cheap made-in-China fixie in Singapore (where I live); when I learned it weighs 17kg I realized why it's so cheap!</p>
","<p>Other than the obvious fact that your better quality (and better handling) bikes tend to be lighter, there's no real correlation between weight and performance (other than a modest effect on acceleration and the obvious effect on hill climbing).</p>

<p>But you can generally (with some exceptions) assume that a bike that is quite a bit (like 2x) heavier than others of the same basic style is poorly made, with poorer quality components.  Eg, hubs and rims are apt to be stamped steel rather than machined aluminum, the crank is likely a solid steel one (with large, crude bearings) vs a 3-piece one with alloy arms and better quality bearings.  The spokes are probably just plated steel rather than stainless.  The pedals are probably stamped steel, and when you spin them you can hear the bearings rattle.  And the tubes in the frame will be so thick and heavy that the bike will feel stiff and ""dead"".</p>

<p>That said, there's no need for a beginning cyclist to find the lightest possible bike.  Eg, a good quality steel frame will be maybe five pounds heavier than the equivalent aluminum one, but the steel frame will be cheaper and more durable.  Other components may be heaver or lighter as well, making possibly a 10-15 pound difference between two essentially identical bikes, but beyond a certain point lighter, more expensive components (eg, drilled brake levers, ultra-thin tires) are less durable than their slightly heavier counterparts.</p>

<p>Finally, if you're still tempted to spend an extra $300-3000 to get that ultralight bike, ask yourself how much you weigh, and whether you couldn't afford to lose a pound or two.  The heaviest thing, by far, on a bike is the rider.</p>

"What parts of a bike could potentially be harmed by degreaser?","16572","","<p>I'v been using citrus degreaser to clean my bikes for years. I usually get a gallon jug of it from the auto parts store, and it lasts a long time. I use it for cleaning the drivtrain, either using a chain cleaner or by soaking the chain overnight. I've used it with a rag to clean the rims. I'll sometimes even use it to scrub a nasty bit of dirt or grease off the frame. However, some of the discussion in <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5176/removing-lubricant-from-the-rear-brake-and-rim"">this very good question</a> has got me wondering: </p>

<p>Are there parts of your bike that can be damaged by degreaser? Obviously, keep it away from the bar tape or a leather saddle, but what mechanical parts could be harmed by citrus degreaser? Also, are there types of degreaser out there that are gentler and could be more appropriate? </p>
","<p>Degreaser acts like a solvent (although I'm unsure if it is technically a solvent, or more of an emulsifier).  With all solvents you'll have to be careful with what they contact--however degreaser is relatively safe compared to stronger solvents.</p>

<p>Each type of solvent has its own list of things it will dissolve--and even brand-to-brand can make a difference, so spot-testing is always recommended.</p>

<p>In general though, the risky things are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rubbers</li>
<li>Adhesives</li>
<li>Organics (leather, etc)</li>
<li>Porous materials</li>
<li>Paints</li>
<li>(obviously) Grease/lubricants</li>
</ul>

<p>Your main concerns should be your tires, your paint, and (as you mentioned) components like grip-tape and seats.  Getting degreaser on these has the potential to stain--so extra precautions may be in order.  Typically your best option is to try and prevent it from contacting them, and cleaning it off quickly with mild soap &amp; water if you do make a mess (although soap and water itself will stain things such as leather if you're not careful).</p>

<p>A secondary concern is that you fully remove the solvent after it's done.  Leaving excess solvent/degreaser behind is a very bad idea--see Rubbing Alcohol below for tips.</p>

<p>As for other solvents/degreasers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rubbing Alcohol is fairly safe.  It has the risk of drying-out leather and rubber, but is very useful for cleaning parts--and especially useful for rinsing degreaser off of things such as chains (it also evaporates and leaves them dry--ideal for re-lubricating).</p></li>
<li><p>Naptha (a.k.a. liquid lighter fluid, not butane) can be very effective as well and is generally safe</p></li>
<li><p>Acetone is a stronger solvent, and likely to be <em>less</em> safe.  It should be used with extreme care, but is a very powerful solvent and can get the job done well and quickly.</p></li>

"What are the disadvantages of more suspension travel?","16512","","<p>Having some suspension travel is always nice, but what disadvantages are there for the bikes handling as the travel increases? This question applies to both to full and front suspension bikes.</p>
","<p>Although this isn't explicitly part of your question, I'll go ahead and throw it in as it's one of the most important factors to consider in terms of increased suspension if you plan on pedaling your bike- the basic principle behind propelling a bike is to convert a mostly downward force (pedaling) into forward momentum (the drivetrain turning the back wheel which in turn moves you and the bike). The more suspension you add, the more difficult it becomes to transfer the energy of pedal strokes into the drivetrain. The better circles you spin the less you'll suffer from this, but the fact remains that even with clipless pedals the majority of the power input to the drivetrain is coming from your glute, quad, and calf pushing down on the pedal during the powerstroke. Extra suspension soaks this up- it's like running on a trampoline.</p>

<p>Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about how additional suspension affects handling... after we briefly cover the benefits of adding suspension travel. Additional suspension will not only smooth out bigger, abrupt bumps (rocks, roots, your riding buddy that crashed in front of you, etc), but it will also smooth out more gradual terrain changes at higher speeds. Additional suspension basically allows the bike to track better and for the rider to maintain better control of the bike over rougher terrain and at speed. More suspension also helps the bike and the rider absorb bigger drops. Combined with a slacker headtube angle and longer wheelbase (all 3 tend to come as a package) you're also given a larger margin for error; mistakes that may have sent you over the bars on a cross country bike may be recoverable on a bike designed for bigger hits. These benefits come with tradeoffs, however.</p>

<p>Additional suspension will cause ""muted"" handling- that is that the bike won't feel as sharp or as connected to the trail. It will not turn as quickly or as precisely. This is due to a multitude of factors that come along with longer travel bikes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wheelbase is longer because chainstays are longer. This is partially by design and partially because in order to make more room for more travel in the back, the rear wheel typically has to be moved out so it doesn't buzz the seat tube at the bottom of the suspension travel. Longer wheelbases make for bigger turning radiuses. Think of how much room it takes to turn a truck around vs a sports coup. You'll suffer the same sort of effect in tight turns. For a little more detail on how chainstay length affects bike handling, <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/17053/how-does-a-chainstay-length-affect-a-mountain-bike-performance-wrt-26-650b/17057#17057"">see my answer to another question here</a>.</li>
<li>A slacker headtube angle almost always goes along with more travel. There are exceptions to this rule, but as you move from cross country to trail to all mountain to downhill and freeride bikes, the front of the bike will get more and more raked out. This stabilizes the bike at higher speeds but makes the bike handle ""slower"" at lower speeds. Slacker headtubes also make for more margin for error in terms of rider input through the bars, but in trade it takes more input to make the bike actually turn.</li>
<li>Weight increases. Bigger hit bikes use bigger tubes to make up the frame, more rugged components, and bigger, heavier duty forks and rear shocks. This is pretty much inevitable as it improves durability and stiffness. That extra weight equates to extra inertia that you have to move around under you, and in general that slows down bike handling.</li>
<li>More travel equals more time to change directions. One of the biggest reasons for this is that it takes a while to load all of that suspension up. You have to push against the shocks hard enough that they start push back harder than the forces of inertia in order to change direction, and this becomes especially noticeable in tight turns on long travel bikes. Other factors play into this, but suspension is the biggest one.</li>
<li>Brake dive goes up as suspension goes up. If you're not familiar with brake dive, it's when the front compresses down (and for full suspension bikes the rear typically comes up), which changes the geometry of the bike. The more suspension, the more dramatic the change in geometry under braking. Modern high end forks have a multitude of adjustments to combat this (slow speed compression adjustment, threshold adjustment, etc) but there's currently no technology that will fully make up for this, and the longer the travel in the front, the worse this will be.</li>
<li>As travel increases so does bottom bracket height which, as Vincent pointed out, raises the bike's center of gravity. Obviously this isn't a 1:1 ratio in terms of additional suspension and additional bottom bracket height, but it is pretty much unavoidable and does have an effect. As is the case with most of these points, there is typically some form of compensation for this. Some trail and all-mountain bikes come equipped with dropper seatposts (hit a lever on the bar and the seapost telescopes down) and DH/FR bikes have their seat height set much lower than a standard XC bike. Dropping seat height allows the you to drop your center of gravity, but ultimately your feet are on the pedals and that height is set, so the you will start out higher off the ground on longer travel bikes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure you've noticed that I've talked a lot about other factors beyond purely the travel of a bike's suspension alone, but it is important to take into consideration the whole package as all of the factors mentioned here work in symphony to create the ride quality of a bike as a whole, and each factor attributes to the ride quality in its own way- both positive and negative. You can't consider suspension travel alone because you can't find a bike where all else is equal beyond travel. You can't take a cross country bike and give it 8 inches of travel and call it a downhill bike anymore than you can take an F1 car and add 3 feet of suspension to it and call it a Baja truck- Each is a purpose built platform in nearly every aspect.</p>

"How much does a typical cardboard bike box weigh?","16490","","<p>Exactly as per the title. This is surprisingly hard for me to google. </p>

<p>I found one estimate of about 10 pounds, and the tech at my LBS ""guesses"" that a standard 30 x 8 x 53 box weighs 2 pounds. For long distance shipping, that much of weight difference can save a lot.</p>
","<p>First, I'll give you an estimate on the weight of a cardboard box. Then, you can read the side notes at the end of this answer to see why the weight is a relatively irrelevant quantity. </p>

<p>EDIT: This <a href=""http://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-4878/Corrugated-Boxes-200-Test/54-x-8-x-28-275-lb-FOL-Side-Loading-Corrugated-Boxes?pricode=WY558&amp;gadtype=pla&amp;id=72173714962&amp;gclid=CPC_leCyt8ACFehj7AodggcA1Q&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> sells a bike box and lists the weight as 7.40 lbs. The rest of this answer gives you a way to estimate this, as well as tells you why this whole problem is irrelevant from a cost perspective. </p>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://www.rcbc.ca/files/u3/aa_facts-cardboard.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>, the density of cardboard is approximately 30-90 kg/m^3 or 0.03-0.09 grams per cubic centimeter. </p>

<p>Now, lets estimate the amount of cardboard in a box. Say each side of the box has thickness T centimeters, and the sides of the box are L,W,H in centimeters. Then, the volume of the cardboard in the box is 2*T*(L*W+L*H+W*H), so the mass of cardboard in the box is density*volume of cardboard or between 0.03*2*T*(L*W+L*H+W*H) and 0.09*2*T*(L*W+L*H+W*H) grams. </p>

<p>Now, lets estimate the dimensions of a box to ship a bike. According to this <a href=""http://www.bikeforums.net/mountain-biking/173190-bike-box-dimensions-anyone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">thread</a>, the typical bike box is about L=130 cm long, W=18 cm wide and H=79 cm height. For thickness, to make the numbers a bit easy, lets say the cardboard is T=1 cm thick (this is significantly thicker than most bike boxes I've seen). </p>

<p>Plugging into the formula, we get a range of approximately 800-2500 grams for the box (1.75 to 5.5 pounds). </p>

<p>I suspect the thickness of the box is closer to half a centimeter (which would halve the estimate) and the density is probably on the higher end of the scale (but probably not 0.09 grams/cm^3). So, I'd guess the weight is closer to 3 pounds.</p>

<p>The simple solution is to take a scale, and a bike box and weigh it. </p>

<p>Side note 1: The dimensions from that thread are only slightly different from your box, and the values come out to be nearly the same. </p>

<p>Side note 2: With carriers like UPS and Fedex, the expense of a shipping bicycle is not primarily the weight, but the fact that a bike box has large dimensions, so it can count as an oversized package [and paying the LBS to pack it]. For small packages of the same weight, note that the cost of shipping will be significantly lower (go to the UPS shipping calculator and put in your source and destination with a small box, say, 10 in x 10 in x 10 in weighing 50 pounds versus a bike box weighing 50 pounds). UPS calls this <a href=""http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/packaging/dim_weight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">dimensional weight</a>, so for your bike box, it will charge you assuming that your package weighs ~75 pounds even if your bike weighs 10 pounds packed. So, I guess you can fill your bike box with some rocks or something cause you're paying for 75 pounds even if you don't use it anyway!</p>

"Why do bikes have their drivetrains on the right?","16484","","<p>Every bicycle I have seen in my life has its gears and chain on the right side? Why is this? The only thing I could find regarding this question is <a href=""http://forums.mtbr.com/showthread.php?t=23837"">this forum topic</a>, which speculates about things such as the prevalence of right-handed people, the idea that it is easier to produce right-handed threads since they are more common, and the traditions of mounting a horse, but I couldn't find anything definite. Does anyone here have any idea?</p>
","<p>Because people are right handed.</p>

<p>Right side drivetrains are rooted in the fact that rotating clockwise causes bolts, etc. to tighten—this dates back to the first <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""safety bicycles""</a> introduced in the 19th century. With the drivetrain on the right, more (standard threaded) parts will be rotating clockwise and thus tightening themselves as the rider pedals. </p>

<p>Drivetrains are on the right today because that's what bicycle builders decided to do in the late 1800s. As to why they originally decided to put drivetrains on the right, it's probably because rear cogs used to be screwed on (some still are). Standard threads dictate rear cogs be on the right, so that pedaling force tightens the cogs. (If they were on the left, pedaling force would likely loosen cogs.)</p>

<p>Today, left-hand drivetrains are possible, but more difficult to create because more reverse-threaded parts are needed. Generally, things like pedals and bottom brackets have threads that are reversed/asymmetric on one side. They're made specifically to work when the drivetrain is on the right—tightening themselves as the rider pedals. If these standard parts are placed on a bicycle with a drivetrain on the left, then those same parts will be <em>loosening</em> themselves as the rider rides. </p>

<p>But why do right-turning bolts tighten? <a href=""http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/09/decided-screws-turn-clockwise/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shortly before the safety bicycle was introduced in the 19th century, the right-turning convention was adopted because it's better to have all bolts work the same way and it's easier to turn them <em>with your right hand</em></a>.

"Securing sliding bar grips without hair spray?","16454","","<p>I have some Bell anatomic handlebar grips that tend to slide (rotate) on the bar. I've read that using hair spray is useful, but tends to be rather permanent. I'd like to make the grip tackier but not a permanent application. Would any of these techniques be worthwhile?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a strip of masking tape on the bar, or run along the inside of the grip?</p></li>
<li><p>a modest swipe of honey in the grip before application? </p></li>
<li><p>a segment of innertube between the two? </p></li>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I have rubbed the inside of the grips out with an isopropyl soaked rag and rubbed down the handlebars of two of the bikes and this has helped a lot.

I will try that, as the grips on the black bars are a bit firmer, but are still not great. Thank you for your answers!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A single wrap of electrical tape on the black SKS bars was just the trick! I did a spread spiral with the tape, and was able to twist the grips on in the same direction as the spiral. (No hair spray has yet made it to my shed.)</p>
","<p>Wipe the bar with isopropyl alcohol. It evaporates completely and will leave dry rubber against a clean bar. </p>

<p>If they slip and slide after more than about 24 hours left alone, the you may need to replace the grips (assuming they're not new).</p>

<p>The high alcohol content is what makes hairspray effective, and using isopropyl alcohol cuts out the sticky residue of the hairspray that is made up of its remaining content. </p>

<p>A grip left on its own will bond to the bar after some time, even if installed completely without any additives, so you still may need to cut them loose when it's time to change them. </p>

<p>Alternatively, use either a <a href=""http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;q=ODI%20Lock%20ons&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=732&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=1241963373731849458&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o5g7TvWnCIuGrAfdnozoDw&amp;ved=0CDwQ8gIwBg"">lock on grip</a>, or a <a href=""http://www.dirtbikeaddicts.com/forum/general-dirt-bike-discussion/2957-what-do-you-use-secure-your-grips.html"">wire twist</a> to secure a loose grip without lock ons. </p>

"Why are single-speed bikes with disc brakes hard to find?","16298","","<p>I've been looking around for bikes (decent frame &amp; components), and find that hybrids do have disc brakes (hydraulic), but are never single-speed. While single-speed bikes typically have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_brake#V-brakes"">linear-pull brakes</a>.</p>

<p>Why is that? Anything in the mechanics that would make the two incompatible? </p>

<p>(In my case, I'd only want a disc brake on the front — for commuting.)</p>
","<p>Usually, singles need to have horizontal dropouts so you can take the chain slack by adjusting the rear axle position.</p>

<p>That means that any brake that is attached to the frame will ""go out of position"" when you adjust the rear axle position. That is, by the way, the reason why some horizontal dropouts are not quite horizontal, but diagonal: to be near-perpendicular to the seat stays where rim brakes are attached, so that wheel movement is ""tangential"" to the brakes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with regular disc brakes, this adjustment would totally misalign the brake pads relative to the disk, if the adjustment is possible at all.</p>

<p>Although there are some bikes with grooves for the disk caliper, where you can ""slide"" the caliper into, it's usually not worth the trouble, because chain slack has to be corrected very often, and caliper setup is relatively laborious.</p>

<p>Also, it would be possible to take the slack with an eccentric bottom bracket, but that is even more esoteric.</p>

<p>Next to that, some single-speeds will come with a flip-flop hub. A flip-flop hub and a disc brake doesn't go well together.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

"How can a beginner cyclist build up power?","16168","","<p>I am a 44-year-old guy, 250 lbs (yes, overweight). I have not been on a bike in over 15 years.  I just picked up a 12 Trek Marlin (Gary Fisher Collection) this weekend, and after riding for about 2 miles, I was done...</p>

<p>How can I build up my muscles and endurance so I can ride longer?</p>
","<ol>
<li><strong>Keep on riding.</strong> Ideally every couple days. If you can't ride, do some other form of cardio exercise, such as going for a walk. I'll bet a couple days after that ride you'll find the same distance a little easier and might even be able to go a little further.</li>
<li><strong>Get a day of rest.</strong> If you've pushed yourself really hard and you're ""done"", take a day off before getting back on the bike. (or at least before doing anything hard on the bike)</li>
<li>You may need to tweak the <strong>bike fit</strong>. Make sure you can inhale fully. Forward/aft position of the seat as well as vertical position of the seat can make a difference in power. Ball of your foot should be on the spindle of the pedal, when the pedal is straight forward your knee should be over the pedal, and at the bottom of your pedal stroke your leg should be near full extension (but still knee a bit bent). You shouldn't need to stretch your leg or rock your hips to reach the pedal at the bottom of the pedal stroke.</li>
<li>Build your <strong>leg strength</strong>, especially quads. Squats or leg presses.</li>
<li>Pay attention to your <strong>pedaling technique</strong>. Don't mash the pedals hard in a high gear. Move them faster in a lower gear, move your leg smoothly through the entire pedal motion and try to pull your foot up a little as it comes up, but without removing your foot from the pedal.</li>
<li><strong>Interval training.</strong> This is the most important thing for building your endurance. Once you're warmed up, ride as hard as you can for 30-60 seconds, then ride easy for several minutes. As you build up endurance, increase from doing that once to doing that several times during a ride. If you can't do 30 seconds, do what you can.</li>
</ol>

<p>Above all else: have fun riding. Don't torture yourself. Enjoy yourself. If you have fun you'll keep it up and keeping up the riding will make more of a difference than any small details.</p>

"Spoke tension is way off but wheel is true, How do I fix this","16089","","<p>After truing my front wheel, it seems that it is laterally true.  However, the spoke tension seem very uneven, with a few spokes that are very taut next to other spokes which are more loose.  If it was a small difference, I wouldn't be too concern, but it seems a bit too big of a difference in tension that has me worried.</p>

<p>I have access to a tension meter and a pro-grade truing stand.  </p>

<p>How should I fix this? </p>

<p>Should I loosen all the spokes and start from scratch or fine tune the existing setup? </p>
","<p>For reference, I used to work for Velomax Wheels, and Easton Wheels.</p>

<p>You may want to back all of the spokes off an equal amount, say 5 or 10 turns.  This will give you a little bit of room for adjustment, without having to completely detention the entire wheel.</p>

<p>There is a book called ""the Bicycle Wheel"", by Jobst Brandt, that does a great job of walking you through the process of truing.</p>

<p>Another way to tell if the spokes are of equal tension is to pluck them like guitar strings.  Since they are all of the same length and same thickness, equal tone means equal tension.  (We used to attach an electronic ""pick up"" to our truing stands, and wear headphones so we could better hear the differences when we plucked the spokes.  This shouldn't be necessary say, in your garage where there is a lot less ambient noise.)</p>

<p>A couple tips for truing (though you may know these already):
- Be sure to back off any adjustment that you make on a singular nipple. This will eliminate any possible spoke 'wind-up"" caused by the twisting of the nipple.  (example - if you want to make a 1/4 turn adjustment, turn the nipple a 1/2 turn and then back off 1/4.)
- Be sure to give adjacent spokes a soft squeeze to help the spokes and nipples settle.
- check for cracked nipples and cracks at or near holes in rims.</p>

<p>Once it is true, then you can bring all spokes back up to tension (the 5 or 10 turns that you originally made.)</p>

<p>Truing stands are very helpful in holding the wheel in the right position to make your adjustments.  (Rather than trying to do it in your hands or in the bicycle frame/fork.)  they also typically have a measurement pin or finger that helps show where (and to what degree) the wheel is out of true. </p>

<p>Tensiometers are okay devices.  Here are a couple of their downfalls: 1-no two are the same and they come out of calibration quite easily. 2-several factors, such as how you hold the tensio on the spoke and where you place the tensio on the spoke, influence the gauge reading.</p>

I am not sure whether mounting a trailer wheel is the same as mounting a normal tire but bear with it I am trying to organize sixtyfootersdude's question at the same time as solving my own problem, just answer the question in the title thank you.</p>
","<p>lantius is almost right IMO.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>use a standard bicycle wheel with a thin through axle, supported from both sides. It's possible to make a <a href=""http://www.moz.geek.nz/mozbike/build/masstrailer/"" rel=""nofollow"">really simple trailer</a> this way that will carry quite a lot. The disadvantage is that it's wider than a single sided mount for the same track width (how far apart the contact patches are). Small wheels off kids bikes are often available cheaply or free, and will usually carry 50-100kg each for a few hundred km before they fall apart (come fail immediately, but they're free so don't worry about that).</p></li>
<li><p>use a single sided wheelchair hub. They are light and designed so the wheels are easily removable, which is handy for a trailer that will be packed away often. But they will not carry much weight (20-40kg each) because bike trailers get used much harder than wheelchairs do. They're also somewhat expensive unless you can find a stock of wrecked wheelchairs.</p></li>
<li><p>use a thick axle with single sided support. MTB hubs come in 15mm (Shimano) and 20mm through axle variants, and a 20mm steel bolt the right length is easy to weld onto the side of a trailer and will hold more weight than even a really well built wheel (you could even drill a 10mm hole through it to save weight. But it does need to be supported well as there is a lot of force on it). I have a trailer built that way that regularly takes 120kg or more without complaint. Unfortunately the <a href=""http://www.moz.geek.nz/mozbike/build/fancy-trailer/"" rel=""nofollow"">build page</a> for it is unfinished even though the trailer is ~3 years old. These <a href=""http://trisled.com.au/shop/shopexd.asp?id=20"" rel=""nofollow"">20"" wheels are expensive</a>($US135 each) because you will not find them second hand but they work. TriSled use those ones on their load bikes rated to over 100kg/wheel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You will need to use small wheels on a two wheel trailer (or build your own hubs) because the side forces in corners are more than a 26"" or bigger wheel can cope with. With a solid build and care when cornering a 24"" wheel can work, but a 16"" or 20"" wheel will just work. If you build your own hubs with 100mm or more between flanges you could use bigger wheels, but you end up with a very wide wheel (you just added 100mm to the width of the trailer without adding to the load space).</p>

<p>Finally, you must look at <a href=""http://hpv.tricolour.net/organ-trailer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Richard Guy Briggs' organ trailer</a>. It's a bike trailer that carries a Hammond organ and player.</p>

"Real measurable benefit to ceramic bearings?","16026","","<p>Is there a real difference between riding on ceramic bearings and riding on stainless steel?</p>

<p>Does anyone have real world experience with them to relate?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I don't know if it matters on the bike, but I saw this today. If this is an indication of the difference in the level of friction resistance ceramic offers, then I'm in. </p>

<p>In the video:</p>

<p>The left pulley shown is Shimano DuraAce, the middle one is Campagnolo Record 11 speed. All three pulleys are fixed to 5Nm of torque at the axle bolt. And all 3 three have at least 1mm of play at the pivot, so there is no extra tension on the bearings compared to normal install in a derailleur. There is a difference in movement of about 18 seconds of spin in the video. It's crazy.</p>

            </div></div></p>
","<p>The short answer to your first question is ""the power savings from using ceramic bearings compared to good steel bearings is almost zero."" The short answer to your second question is ""yes, it is possible to measure the difference but it's not easy."" The longer answer, and the support for the shorter answers is below. </p>

<p>First, however, it depends a little on whether you're talking wheel bearings, or bottom bracket bearings, or both. If you're interested in measuring the difference, the way you measure differs for the two. BB bearing drag would show up in differences in drivetrain efficiency, while hub bearings would show up as a component of rolling resistance. The difference, of course, is that drivetrain losses only occur when you're pedaling, not while you're coasting, while rolling losses occur as long as you're rolling, whether pedaling or not. </p>

<p>You can measure differences in no-load hub bearing drag by holding the wheel up in the air with a fork, using a home-made speed sensor jury-rigged with a reed switch connected to a digital voice recorder. You spin the wheel up, then record and calculate the difference in timing ""clicks"" as the wheel decelerates. Swap bearings, lather, rinse, repeat. </p>

<p>However, this would be in a no-load setting and you might think differences in bearing drag might be amplified in load-bearing situations. If so, you'd have to test that way. You could do it in the lab but it's also possible to do yourself, in the field, with the jury-rigged speed sensor. </p>

<p>First some background. The rolling component of drag is typically measured by the coefficient of rolling resistance, Crr (the coefficient of aero drag is Cd, which is usually multiplied by the front surface area, A, and described by the combined term CdA). Crr can have a speed-dependent component but at cycling speeds this is negligible so we can assume Crr is constant. If so, the power demanded for moving a bike and rider at a given speed is pretty well known and understood: rather than go through it all here, I'll point to a (um, brilliant) method that allows you to estimate CdA and Crr which can be found <a href=""http://anonymous.coward.free.fr/wattage/cda/indirect-cda.pdf"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Now, if you do all of this, you'll find that for a typical bike, the total overall Crr from all sources (tires, tubes, hub bearings, and typical ""smooth"" road surface) of around .005. The Crr for really good tires on that same surface might be .0045; for really lousy tires the Crr might be .006; and for a really rough surface the Crr might go as high as .01. And, some context if you look at the power equation linked to above, you see that Crr scales exactly like gradient in its effect on power so when the Crr is .01, the effect on power is exactly like climbing a 1% grade. Likewise, an increase in Crr of .001, due either to a different tire or to putative bearing differences, is just like climbing a grade 0.1% steeper. </p>

<p>Here's one more fact, also derivable from the link above: a rule of thumb is that at 25 mph on a flat hard surface, a cyclist in good aero position needs around 250 watts (an exceptional aero position is achievable with under 200 watts). At 25mph, a difference in Crr of about .0005 is roughly equivalent to a difference in power of 5 watts. That is, a difference between a good tire and a very good tire is worth about 5 watts at 25 mph.</p>

<p>If you have done any field-testing of bicycle drag you'll realize that 5 watts difference in rolling resistance is pretty noticeable. Riders report that the difference between using ceramic and steel hub bearings is not noticeable. </p>

<p>*Yesterday I got bit by a patch of gravel. Seriously.   </p>

<p>Also, no chance in hell I'm trading these rims out. They cost more than a month's rent.</p>

<h2>Update: Yesterday's ride home</h2>

<p>So when I left work yesterday, I pumped my tires up to 145 psi as suggested by @freiheit, and it's embarrassingly obvious that I have not been putting enough air in my tires (as in, ""holy crap, this is awesome, why didn't somebody tell me this sooner?""). The ride was a little bouncier, but my acceleration and top speed were significantly increased.   </p>

<p>That being said, I still got a flat about mile 7. Good news, it wasn't a snakebite, so that's nice for a change. Got home, put a new tube in and tried pumping to 150 psi, and the tire blew up*, and it failed suspiciously near the first flat. I didn't find anything in the tread (glass/nails/whatever) or any glaring defects/breaches, but the tread is pretty old and worn out at this point, so I ordered a new one. This of course, was before @amcnabb pointed out that those tires are slightly larger than the max recommended tire size for the wheelset.</p>

<p>I'll update this once I get my new tire, but it looks like not enough air + old tire might have been the source of my troubles.</p>

<p>*Especially embarrassing living in Watertown, MA, where my neighbors are pretty suspicious of loud noises right now. I got a few dirty looks.</p>
","<p>Inflate your tires to a higher pressure. Use a pump with a pressure gauge instead of going by ""feel"". Check the pressure more often. The max pressure listed on the sidewall is a good starting point, but if you're already inflating to max psi, you may want to exceed it a bit.</p>

<p>It's likely you have a slow leak, and you're at a low inflation pressure by the time you get the snakebite. Check the tires and rims <em>very</em> thoroughly for sharp bits, and use water submersion to check the tube for leaks, including the valve. A fresh tube wouldn't hurt.</p>

<p>If your roadside inflation is with CO2 cartridges, be aware that CO2 leaks out faster, so you'll need to top off with air the next few days.</p>

<p>You may want to seriously consider buying a second wheelset with wider rims for urban riding with wider tires, and keep the narrow rims and tires for races and weekend rides.</p>

<p>I occasionally find myself in both extremes—while heading up the very steep hills of the Bay Area the lowest gearing sometimes isn't enough and on much of a downhill grade my legs can't keep up in the highest.</p>

<p>Is it worth going to a wider range on the front or rear?</p>
","<p>Ultimately it's a trade-off between a wider range of gears and bigger jumps between those gears.  There will always be uphills that are too steep for your lowest gear and downhills where you spin out.  If you try to fix both problems with a wider range cassette (your triple already has a great range) you may find that you're never quite in the ""right"" gear for all of the in-between situations.</p>

<p>I'm using a 11-32 cassette on my road bike (with a MTB derailleur for more capacity).  I have plenty of climbing gears but rarely use the small cogs since I spin at around 90rpm.  Like the Bay Area, there are a lot of hill around here.  But I find the jumps between gears too big (either spins too easily or too hard) so am looking for a narrower range cassette.</p>

<p>If you want just a bit more range for climbing, you'll need to jump up to at least a 28-tooth large cog (you'll barely notice the difference going from 26 to 27) which <em>might</em> require a long-cage derailleur.  On the high end, a 12-tooth cog will be a noticeable difference over your 13.  Since you're used to a compact range you probably don't want to go with a much bigger cassette.</p>

<p>I have a 20 y.o. MTB triple with 7-cog cassette, and I recently needed the rear wheel replaced (warped and cracked).  Took it to LBS, they only had 8/9 speed wheels and so told me they had to add a spacer when mounting the cassette.  No problem, I know 7-speeds are old; ""you should adjust the derailleur so it doesn't drop the chain"", cool I can handle that.</p>

<p><strong>WRONG?</strong>  This is where they installed the spacer, which I noted but had no idea at the time might be wrong. 1,2): LBS installed spacer below cassette, which led to 3) small cog NOT able to engage hub splines. (I verified spacer thickness was ~4.5mm.)</p>

<p>I assume the lockring friction was all that was keeping the small gear from spinning. Turns out I could spin on that cog just fine, but standing on a climb caused immediate movement and I guess lockring breakage. As soon as I stood up, I heard a bang and my feet fell out from under me; immediately I was falling forward over the handlebars and splashed on the ground with the bike on top of me (earning road-rashed arms and a fractured elbow, plus surgery for a plate and 6 screws).  I thought I had broken the chain, but it turned out to be fine.  Disassembling to put the bike in the car, I noticed the small cog was hanging loose and the lockring was gone.</p>

<p><strong>RIGHT?</strong> Playing around with the assembly aferwards, it looks like <strong>on top</strong> is where the spacer should be placed, or at least fits best.  4) Smallest cog engages hub splines as it should; 5) the tabs in the spacer <em>just barely</em> contact the splines.</p>

<p>Because I have these pins, do I need a different kind of spacer, one with recesses?</p>
","<p>A spacer to convert an 8/9 speed freehub to  7 speed freehub goes behind the cassette, between the hub shell and the cassette. Most cassette lock rings will not bind on the spacer, they will go inside it if you place it on the outside. </p>

<p>In addition, the aluminum used in most cassette spacers is too soft, and would compress under direct compression from the lock ring. It would not stay tight.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

"How should I negotiate price with bicycle salespeople?","15854","","<p>Aside from just knowing <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/170/21"">the best time to make the purchase of your bike</a>, what other specific tactics can I make use of in negotiating price on a bike? For instance, what devalues a bike <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/743/21"">aside from just wear and tear</a>, and how can I use these to get a better price on a bike?</p>

<p>Note:
I appreciate all the comments about LBS and local patronage of merchants is something we can all support. However, like going to buy a car, there are always things to know about a product that (when negotiating) play in the favor of merchants (overvalues the car: like when you had to get on a waiting list to get a Prius) and in the favor of buyers (devalues: when you had to be wary of your gas pedal buying a Prius). This is a question to benefit buyers of bikes.</p>
","<p>Don't expect much until you know the guys that work at a bike shop. I bought my first road bike (a single speed) from my not-so-local LBS because it was on sale (45 miles from my house, with <em>several</em> bike shops in between). In the process, I discovered that I got along well with the guys that work there. In return for our growing relationship, they started giving me pointers about maintenance, and discounts on accessories (computer, bar tape, etc).</p>

<p>When I referred my father-in-law to them to get a bike (he's a doctor and doesn't have the same price constraints that I do) they gave him a pretty good deal because I sent him. I have no doubt that when I've saved my pennies enough to budget for a new bike I'll get as good a deal as they can offer me, <em>without</em> having to ask for a deal.</p>

<p>Most bike shop employees and owners could make a lot more money doing something else, but own/work at a bike shop because they love cycling. I appreciated the desire to stretch your dollars as far as they'll go, but nobody is entitled to special deals without earning them.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of Double Butted vs Straight Spokes when building a wheel?","15824","","<p>Straight spokes will have the same diameter through the whole length, double butted spoked are thinner in the middle than at the ends. Here's my current understanding of the benefits of each:</p>

<h1>Double Butted Spokes</h1>

<ol>
<li>Lighter than Straight Spokes</li>
<li>More elasticity in the wheel (less rigid / will flex some before breaking)</li>
<li>Spokes will bow out less at the crossings</li>
<li>Easier to bend/lace</li>
<li>When overtightened or stressed too hard, the spoke is more likely to snap than the rim eyelets or the hub's flange</li>
</ol>

<h1>Straight Spokes</h1>

<ol>
<li>Stronger than butted spokes</li>
<li>Less elasticity in the wheel (more rigid / may break before flexing)</li>
<li>More available at bike shops</li>
<li>Cheaper</li>
</ol>

<p>What are other reasons to use one over the other, or more pros/cons that may influence one's decision to use one over the other when hand building wheels? ('Straight spokes are easier to machine lace' may be true, for example, but doesn't help me decide which to order)</p>
","<p>In his book 'The bicycle wheel' Jobst Brandt, says that double butted spokes will be more resistant to fatigue failure when built into a wheel. </p>

<p>This is because spokes break because of the cyclic stress they suffer as the wheel rotates. </p>

<p>As the spoke rotates thru the bottom of the wheel it experiences a reduction in tension. </p>

<p>Butted spokes are more elastic so this reduction in tension is spread over more spokes, each experiencing a smaller reduction in tension.</p>

<p>Wheels are an order of magnitude stiffer than the tyres they roll on, so any stiffness differences will not be noticeable. A wheel built with butted spokes will be able to carry a heavier load before any of the spokes become slack. At this point the rim is no longer restrained and the wheel will be more likely to collapse.</p>

"29"" wheels - what advantage do they provide over smaller wheels?","15688","","<p>I was wondering what advantages 29"" wheels give. From what I understand they are well suited to mountain biking. Are they any use on road bikes perhaps? </p>
","<p>Regarding road bikes, the 29"" rim size is actually the same as standard 700c wheels used on road bikes -- only the tire is different (larger).</p>

<p>One difference that I don't see mentioned often is that 29"" vs 26"" wheels change your effective gearing.  If you have two bikes with the same gearing but one with 29"" wheels and one with 26"", the larger wheel will have a higher gearing overall because of the larger wheel diameter (one turn of the pedals move you farther down the trail).  This means that the 29er can help you reach a higher top speed, but the 26er will have a lower climbing gear.</p>

"Converting a Bicycle without gears into a Geared one?","15677","","<p>I have a racer street bicycle without gears. I want to convert that into a geared one. For that I will need to modify the rear part of the frame where the wheel goes in. Is it advisable to do so?</p>
","<p>Depends on just what bicycle it is, but its probably possible to add gears in some way. But it may be expensive or complicated.</p>

<p>First thing to check is the frame spacing, ie the width between the rear dropouts. Many singlespeeds use 120mm wide hubs, whereas modern geared hubs are 130mm (road) or 135mm (mountain bike). If it is a steel frame, then it is usually possible to spring it out a bit, up to about 5mm or so, to fit a wider hub.</p>

<p>If the frame is only 120mm, then your options are limited. There are some internal hub gears for 120mm frames, eg from Sram or Sturmey-Archer. But they are fairly expensive, or have a limited range of gears.</p>

<p>If your frame is wide enough for a 130mm or 135mm hub, then you can use a standard road or mountain bike hub with a cassette.</p>

<p>Then you will need to attach the derailleur. If the frame is designed for singlespeed, it won't have a derailleur hanger. But you can bolt one on, depending on what type of droputs you have. eg if you have horizontal dropouts, you could use this <a href=""http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/dmr-chain-tugs-mech-hanger/rp-prod249"" rel=""nofollow"">DMR Chain Tugs &amp; Mech Hanger</a>.</p>

<p>Also the frame probably won't have guides for the gear cable. You can buy clamp on cable guides, or you could just use zip-ties to hold the cable in place.</p>

<p>Whether all this is worth it is another question. As you will have to buy quite a few parts (wheel, cassette, derailleur, gear levers etc), which could get expensive. Plus quite a bit of work fitting it all. It may be easier just to buy a bike with gears instead.</p>

"What kind of bicycles do they ride in the Tour de France?","15649","","<p>I've been looking at a lot of the coverage of the Tour de France. All of the attention is on the cyclists, and no attention whatsoever on the cycles. Even in photographs or videos, they are so far away, or the bikes are moving by so fast, you can't tell what they are riding.</p>

<p>I know I definitely can't afford whatever kind of bike they are using, and it would be horribly impractical for me to ride one since I'm commuting, not racing. I'm just very curious as to what is the top of the line in terms of bikes. When I look at high end bikes in shops or online I can't tell if they are actually superior or if they are just loaded with expensive gimmicks.</p>

<p>What frames, brakes, seats, gears, tires, etc. are the world's top competitors using?</p>
","<p>The focus is on the riders, because the bikes are just not so different from one another. The UCI (international cyclists' union) tightly regulates what shape and weight the bike must be, and what technical solutions are acceptable, so the sponsoring manufacturers can only compete on relatively minor features such as aerodynamic tubing or frame stiffness. These are of no practical importance to an everyday cyclist.</p>

"Is there such a thing as frame failure?","15629","","<p>Several general questions have been asked regarding how long a bike or bike frame will ""<a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/5409/1683"">last</a>"", and the gist of answers seems to be that a bike can last quite a while of the replaceable components are replaced and the bike is reasonably well maintained.</p>

<p>But what about the inherent structural integrity of the frame itself? Is there such a thing as a risk of sudden frame failure or disintegration after some level of use? Do bikes ever fall apart, or develop a risk of breaking or fracturing along weak points? One of my bikes has more miles on it than the car I'm turning in — and I wonder about the integrity of the <em>car</em>! </p>
","<p>Yes, frames do fail even if they're not crashed or ridden excessively harshly. The only way to mitigate this problem is to inspect the frame regularly during your maintenance and cleaning. Look for cracks. When riding, pay attention to creaks and squeeks and always find the root cause (it could be a crack).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A bad weld could hold fine for years before coming apart.</p></li>
<li><p>Unchecked rust can eat through steel tubes, either from the outside-in or the inside-out. Once it starts, you have to keep on top of it or it will eventually take the frame. Rust also seems to have ""good taste"" in tubing by preferring the pretty Italian stuff to, say, gas-pipe schwinn.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_%28material%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Metal fatigue</a> can form cracks that grow slowly until the frame suddenly snaps (I've seen this personally where the chainstay meets the dropout, and on crank arms). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Aluminum is the worst culprit for fatigue cracks. Aluminum seatposts and steerer tubes also have a tendency to develop aluminum oxide blooms that may permanently jam the seatube/steerer-tube in the frame.</p>

<p>Carbon typically won't survive a bad-enough crash. I've heard of long-term delamination issues, but never saw one personally. AFAIK every carbon frame ""dies"" in a crash or mishap that damages the frame to the point where the owner no longer trusts it. Anyone have stories about what happens to carbon that is not crashed?</p>

<p>For a concrete example, below is my own failure from a few years ago. It happened as I was cresting a very steep hill. I heard a loud ""pop"" and didn't realize what happened until I looked around and saw the chainstay separate from the dropout with each pedal stroke. This is a steel bike and was totally repairable, BTW. I didn't crash as a result (but neither was I going fast). Note the little bit of rust visible at the top of the crack. It indicates that the crack had been there for some time before the total failure.

"When is using a suspension fork worth it?","15623","","<p>I've recently picked up biking again since my childhood years, so I'm quite the newbie. I've figured out most of the features I'd need so far but I'm at a loss at this one.
Why would you pick front suspension?</p>

<p>In my case, I'll be commuting 5 miles each way every day, 1/2 through paved road and 1/2 through gravel trails with a ~200m stretch of moderately bumpy off-road.</p>
","<p>Proviso - my advise presumes you are not looking at forking out $2K or more for a bike, and probably significantly less. At a high price point I might suggest suspension. I also presume the gravel section is well maintained with average (pea - grape) size gravel (Where I ride, we sometime use logging roads, the ""gravel"" is stones about 2""-3"" across.), and straight rather than technical single track</p>

<p>Advantages of suspension - Softens the ride on the arms making the ride more comfortable, holds front wheel on the ground providing better handling, especially  while cornering. Allows you to ride a straighter line than you might otherwise be able to. </p>

<p>Disadvantages: Heavy and very expensive for good shocks, need maintenance and cheap ones don't really work well. Absorb energy while riding slowing you down - can be mitigated with a lockout, but even ones with lockouts move a bit. </p>

<p>You only have 200m of rough ground to cover, so a suspension fork is probably overkill. If I was buying a bike for that commute, for the same $$$ you will get a significantly better bike with no shocks, any loss of time over 200m of rough ground would be made up on the rest of the 5 miles because of the better quality bike. Cheap shocks won't really help with the comfort, so unless you can get to at least a mid range in price, don't bother.</p>

<p>I would consider padded hand grips and gloves - cheap and easy to ""tweak"" if needed. Also big tires will help with the rough ground and gravel - I would look at 1.75""-2"" slicks, and probably a 29er MTB of cyclocross style wheels (depending on your height).  </p>

<p>Consider a quality steel frame if you cannot afford carbon - they absorb vibrations much better than aluminum. The problem is many shops do not stock, and know nothing about steel and will tell you ""stories"". </p>

<p>Is there anything to distinguish one from the other? For example if an LBS stocks Conti Gatorskins should I say, ""No, I'm looking for Marathons""? Or are they more or less equally effective (price and, more importantly but less easy to measure, puncture resistance and rolling resistance)?</p>

<p>My wheels are 700x32.</p>
","<p>Might as well chime in on my favourite tyre...</p>

<p>I have Marathon Plus on my 20"" wheeled folder and Marathon (front) + Marathon Plus (rear) on my MTB.</p>

<p>The smaller wheel size is more aggressive with anything it finds in the road and I tried some pre-production Conti efforts on that but they were only good for a few months, after that I was picking punctures up on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>As for the MTB, the reason I have the Plus on the back but not the front is that the front wheel doesn't carry that much weight compared to the back. It also flicks stuff up that goes under the rear tyre. for instance a piece of glass, flat in the road and minding its own business, in the wet will get unseated from the tarmac by the front wheel and the back wheel will then catch it good and proper.</p>

<p>I have yet to have a flat on the Schwalbe tyres I own, so I would recommend mix and match with 'Plus' on the back.</p>

<p>Also, the British Post Office use them for their post bikes. Their posties do not go at Tour de France speeds, however, they have a bigger fleet of bicycles than anyone else in the UK and they use the Schwalbe tyres because they are better.</p>

<p>I also like it how Schwalbe just do tyres. I have met the guys and they have the product focus and have done a really good job listening to customers and getting the most out of their far-East supplier. The product really has came a long way from the 'Swallow' tyres of yesteryear.</p>

<p>I used to swear by certain 'Panaracer', 'Michelin' and 'Specialized' tyres, however those were false dawns. Schwalbe Marathon Plus is the real deal if you don't want to have to bother yourself with punctures. Get them!</p>

I weighed the tape used on my old rims and it weighed 36 grams from both. I forget the exact math but it was almost a full 30 grams i would be saving on rotational wheel weight and the fit actually gives me confidence to go with a lighter tube due to less concern of pinching on install with rim tape.</p>

"Why doesn't ""butt soreness"" affect serious cyclists?","15340","","<p>Over time, my seat (butt) has been broken in by my saddle. I don't have a callus, and nothing obvious has changed. Physiologically, why doesn't riding cause seat soreness anymore?</p>

<p>On the flip-side, what does a saddle do to a less-experienced posterior? Is soreness caused by something as simple as bruising, or is there some other effect going on?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To clarify, I am referring to muscle soreness caused by the saddle rather than soreness of the skin (e.g., saddle sores). The question is about why the soreness doesn't affect experienced cyclists who have adapted (over the course of many months or years).</p>
","<p>When seated on the saddle, your weight is primarily supported (or should be) at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberosity_of_the_ischium"">ischial tuberosities</a> which are commonly known as the ""sit bones"". </p>

<p>Quoted from Wikipedia: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When sitting, the weight is frequently placed upon the ischial tuberosity.[2] The gluteus maximus covers it in the upright posture, but leaves it free in the seated position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, there is very little sub-cutaneous fat or muscle tissue covering the sit bones while sitting on a bicycle saddle and thus little ""padding"" between the skin and bone. So, when you go through periods of not riding or are new to riding, that region is not adapted to compression and impact from the saddle. After riding for a while, the bone, tendons, and muscle in that region adapts by strengthening in that region, and no doubt vascular and nerve changes occur as well. </p>

<p>What happens in the case of an inexperienced cyclist or one getting back into cycling, is that micro-damage occurs to the bone, muscle, tendons and other tissue in the area. The micro-damage leads to inflammation and thus pain/soreness. At that point, the the tissues begin to repair and strengthen. The bone is thicker and stronger, the muscles/tendons are stronger, nerves are adapted to the stresses, new blood vessels, etc. Once those tissues have remodeled and healed, there is no more soreness. (Actually, the process can happen again if one goes say, riding for 3 hours to riding for 6 hours, but usually won't be as bad the second time around.) </p>

<p>It's pretty much like any other area of the body that goes through the adaptations from not being exercised to being exercised. So, one gets sore at first, but as muscle/skeletal tissue adapts, one is not sore later on. To some degree, the issue is similar a bruise, but it's much more like the muscular/skeletal adaptations that occurs from exercise. </p>

<p>This would mean riding with my hands mostly <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/5255/6678"">on the hoods</a>, but it seems like a slightly awkward position to use the brakes from:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O95Rg.jpg"" alt=""Braking with hands on the hoods of drop handlebars""></p>

<p>Riding on the drops seems to offer better access to the brakes, but is apparently <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5251/how-to-use-drop-handlebars-properly/5255#5255"">""less stable due to narrower hand position""</a> anyway — so when talking about cycling with cars, vans and busses around, doesn't seem like the best choice either (for a non-proffesional).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Overall, is that just all in my head, or is there some cause for concern?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OzMjp.jpg"" alt=""Hands on hoods while biking""></p>

<p><strong>Also, is there any reaction speed data compared with flat handlebars, or other such studies, for this?</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Personally, I'd be most worried about situations where I need to react quickly, as well as situations that are usual but I need to be consistent in my braking. </p>

<p>Flat handlebars are like second nature to me, would those be safer?</p>
","<p>TL;DR: Position: drop bars can be set up to match almost any reasonable flat-bar body/head position and hence visibility.
Braking: if you can squeeze your front brake from the hoods hard enough to initiate rear wheel lift-off on dry flat pavement - you're good.</p>

<p>The long answer: Position: Higher body/head position will generally give you better visibility. An average drop bar bike (properly fitting) will give you considerably lower body/head position than average flat bar bike (properly fitting), but this is not because of the bars per se. Rather, the manufacturers know that drop bar bikes are perceived as more ""sporty"" and so a bike with relatively high drops (hence less aerodynamic position) will not sell as well. Still, road bikes with high-ish drop bars are available (look for touring or ""relaxed"" road bikes). If you want still higher body/head position, you can use stem risers and/or adjustable stems. I can't think of any reason for reaction time to be different between drops and regular bars if body position is the same.</p>

<p>It's important to note, however, that higher body position means more drag and less speed; also, any position higher than touring will be <em>less</em> comfortable on longer/regular rides, and comfort affects safety.</p>

<p>Braking: Whether some particular braking setup is safe enough depends on how quickly you can stop the bike in an emergency. Because a bicycle/rider system's combined center of gravity is so high and close to the front wheel, on clean dry pavement the most braking you can get is when the rear wheel is about to lift off. Unlike with a car or even a regular motorcycle, clean dry pavement always provides enough traction to do that on a bicycle while still not skidding the front tire. BTW, that also means that rear brake is useless in an emergency on dry pavement - so don't use it!</p>

<p>Now, whether you can initiate rear wheel lift-off from the hoods depends on several factors - your hands' strength, your fingers' length, what type of brakes you use and, perhaps most importantly, how well tuned your whole braking system is (levers, cables, calipers, pads, rims/discs). If you can initiate that lift-off with conventional rim brakes, you can choose any bike you want (or keep existing one). If you can't, you can always upgrade something. Longer fingers are probably out of the question, and developing strength takes time, but better brakes are readily available. As of now, the most powerful solution would probably be SRAM RED 22 hydraulic hoods/levers and matching RED 22 disc brakes; much cheaper but probably just as powerful solution is TRP HY/RD hybrid (cable/hydraulic) disc brakes; there are also less integrated hybrid systems. The cheapest (and good enough for most) would be just giving your existing brakes a tune up.</p>

"Disadvantage of Hybrid Bikes on Mountains","15314","","<p>Everybody know that Hybrid bike can be used for mountain cycling. But I want to know what are the disadvantages if we do so? And what are disadvantages of using mountain bikes in cities.</p>
","<p>Since a hybrid is a combination of two or more types of bike characteristics, there are many possibilities, and you should consider what aspects of the particular bike where meant for the mountain or for the road and see if they meet you needs.</p>

<p><strong>Tires</strong></p>

<p>You can use almost any tire, provided your frame has the clearance needed. Wider tires can be safely used at lower speeds and also provide a contact patch with a larger area, both give better rolling characteristics for off-road riding (more traction, shock absorbtion and lower rolling resistance on rough terrain). The rougher the terrain you want to ride, the fatter the tire you want.</p>

<p>Some Hybrid frames won't accept tires wide enough for serious MTB riding. On the other hand, a wide frame and fork can accept the thinnest tire that fits your rims.</p>

<p><strong>Drivetrain</strong></p>

<p>Generally, MTB requires low gear ratios to provide mechanical advantage for ascents on rough terrain or for extreme climbs. On the other hand, Road riding requires high gear ratios to provide high travel speed while keeping the cadence (pedal rotation speed) relatively low. Commuting requires a mid range gearing, which you may modify towards any of the two extremes depending on how hilly is your city, your style and physical condition.</p>

<p>A road drivetrain may not have the low ratios needed for off road riding. Generally speaking, the same slope is rideable faster on pavement, thus you can use higher gears. An offroad slope has many smaller obstacles like roots, stones and terrain irregularities that do not allow the use of high ratios.</p>

<p>A secondary disadvantage is that larger chainrings get closer to the ground and so, are more likely to hit obstacles like logs or big stones.</p>

<p>Mountain drivetrain is normally good enough for smooth commuting. For a flat city where you don´t need higher speeds it means that only the mid-range gears would be used. The low gears may come in handy if you commute on a hilly city with steep climbs. </p>

<p>However, for high speed road riding, you may run out of gears.</p>

<p><strong>Frames</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally a road frame has an horizontal top tube, this reduces standover clearance. (distance between the top tube and the crotch of the rider while he or she is standing with both feet on the ground). Some hybrid bikes are designed like this. On mountain riding you usually need greater clearance, making this a disadvantage of certain Hybrid frames for MTB use.</p>

<p>The other disadvantage <em>may</em> be that the hybrid frame may not be properly reinforced to withstand the high demands of serious MTB riding or may not accept upgrading certain components, like a fork with suspension (or greater travel).</p>

<p>On the other hand, MTB frames tend to have sloping top tubes to provide better stand over clearance. While this is not properly a disadvantage for road riding, or commuting, the lower top-tube and seat tube junction also lowers the possible mounting points for rear racks, (if any) which in turn may reduce the possibility of fitting one. This is a disadvantage only if you need a rear rack with medium to high load capacity. (Because there are seat post mounted rear racks with limited load capacity).</p>

<p><strong>Suspension forks and frames</strong>. </p>

<p>Some hybrids have mountain geometry but rigid forks. These can be used on light offroad use, specially for prepared trails that have been smoothed out. And for city riding if the city has good infrastructure (no potholes at least).</p>

<p>A suspension fork with around 100mm travel is good for any riding you can do on a hard tail frame (non suspension frame). It's excellent for trail riding and for cities where potholes are common or if your riding involves a lot of getting on and off curbs.</p>

<p>If you don't have a fork with suspension blocking, you should at least have one with preload regulation and rebound control. Higher preload and slower rebound setting than used for mountain riding helps to reduce pedal bob, thus improving efficiency for city riding. The same goes for using suspension frames for city riding. </p>

<p>A suspension frame is very unlikely to have mounting points for rear racks and complete mud guards.</p>

<p><strong>My personal experience</strong></p>

<p>I have successfully commuted on a very hilly city and made two 500+  kilometers rides (with around 100 km stages) on a hardtail mountain bike with slick tires, an air suspension fork, 3x9 mountain drivetrain, straight handlebars and a seatpost mounted rear rack.</p>

<p>The low gears (22/34) have been a blessing on steep roads or when I get really tired. On the high end, my 42/11 top ratio has been enough for the speeds that my training level allows me. The straight handlebar provide only one hand position, which causes hand and wrist strain on long rides.</p>

<p>The mountain fram geometry allows for a more upright position. This proved good for the back o my neck, since being 4+ hours on a bike at a time caused pain on my peers that where riding road bikes.</p>

<p>The thin, slick tires are so great that I can almost roll as easy as my road counterparts, but they are not as skinny as theirs, so I get slightly more comfort on rippled or highly cracked asphalt and more confidence against potholes.</p>

<p>The air fork allows me to easily tune it, using higher pressure to reduce pedal bob, since it doesn't have locking. The rear rack is very useful for light loads, but it vibrates a lot more than a frame mounted rack.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that my frame has v-brakes that perform a little bit better than regular road brakes.</p>

<p>My bike fits my needs closely because I didn't bought it as is, I have changed many components over the years. The only change I want to make now is to incorporate a road or a touring handlebar. (but I don't want to change my brakes or shifters...).</p>

<p>I'm currently experimenting with a rigid fork and bar tape on a riser (MTB) handlebar.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that bikes have so many components that the possible combinations are almost endless. There is no possible way of making a bike that will excel in all types of riding, let alone one bike that fits everybody's needs. </p>

<p>This means that any bike will have disadvantages for certain type of riding, so it is up to you to define your needs and pick the bike that most closely meets them, experiment, research and decide whether changing some component is necessary and possible (considering budget and compatibility) to make <em>your particular riding</em> better.</p>

"Are there any manufacturers of steel road bikes today?","15228","","<p>Is there any major bike manufacturer that still makes steel road bikes today?<br/>
The frame of my old Bridgestone got cracked and the crack is too close to the alloy BB lug for me to be able to weld it. I need a new training bike and it has to be steel because aluminium goes bad too quickly on local roads and I've seen way too many carbon horror stories.<br/>
Also, it needs to a major manufacturer because I won't get other stuff here in my country.<br/>
PS There is a supply-demand problem with second-hand steel bikes. Only lower end steel frames are sold second-hand and then too at the cost of aluminium frames.<br/>
PPS I've already checked the websites of most major manufacturers, nothing there.<br/><br/>

","<p>Depending on what you consider a ""major brand"", there really are a lot of nice steel bikes around these days.  If I were going this route, I'd look to some of the brands that focus on the steel frames, rather than complete bikes.  The list below should get you started.  While they aren't the biggest names in the industry, they do have good distribution so you should ask about availability at your local bike shop.  Or order a frame online.  Good luck!</p>

"Explaining the effects of frame geometries","15210","","<p>I asked about <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2767"">buying a bike here</a>, and someone asked on my behalf about <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2795"">test-riding a bike before buying</a>.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>what should I know, or should have known, about the sizing or 'geometry' of a bike?</strong></p>

<p>In reply to my question about buying, people talked about the wheel size etc.; but not about the frame size, or the fork angle.</p>

<p>In the question about test-riding, people talked about aspects of the 'fit' which I think can be adjusted (i.e. the height and front/back position of the seat, and the height of the handle-bar) ... and which are documented elsewhere ... and which are therefore maybe superficial and less important for the purposes of this question.</p>

<p>But, what about the geometry which can't be adjusted: the distance between the wheels, for example?</p>

<p>On a bike which I've just bought, I've noticed for example (since buying it) that the front wheel is rather closer to my foot than I am used to; I expect that's just one example (of a geometry/metric which as a novice it hadn't occured to me to think about).</p>

<p>This Wikipedia article ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_frame#Frame_geometry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frame geometry</a>"" introduces the vocabulary but without much detail. Googling reveals mostly short articles too, more ad-bait than detailed/informative.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Given that I'm asking for details, a kind of 'science' question, this question is probably too long to answer here. What I might be asking for then is a link to a suitable introduction/reference (online, or a book...).</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively you might (I don't know) be able to give a short/summary answer along of, ""The most important measurements to look at are A, B, and C, which have the following effects... Taken together these few most important measurements account for 90% of the effects of geometry on fit/performance/handling/comfort.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or, is this a topic that people don't learn about by reading, and which can only come from extensive experience of riding multiple bikes? How did you come by your understanding of geometry? Can you look at two bikes of a similar type and say, ""Oh, those have different shapes/measurements"" and understand what that (difference in measurements) means or implies?</p>

<hr>

<p>PS.: interested in 'ordinary' frames: not frames with a suspension (so, not frames for off-road/all-terrain/jumping); not recumbent; not track/racing; not exotic/expensive materials.</p>
","<p>I see frame geometry having 3 primary affects</p>

<ol>
<li>Fitting the rider; which you're already addressing and I won't talk about here...  But a lot of geometry stuff comes down to making the other stuff work with fitting riders on the bikes. It's very important.</li>
<li>Fitting stuff on the bike</li>
<li>Handling characteristics.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since you asked, I'm talking about your basic on-road diamond-frame bike. Cruiser, road, commuter, urban, touring, racer...</p>

<h2>Fitting Stuff On the Bike</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wheel clearance</strong> affects how big the tires can be and how easy it is to mount fenders. For the rear wheel you need to look at the chainstay bridge, seatstay bridge and seat tube. For the front wheel, look at the fork crown and downtube. Often either not measured or simply given to you as a maximum tire size measurement.</li>
<li>""<strong>Toe overlap</strong>"" -- how close the front wheel gets to the front of the pedals. More of an issue with fenders, and not really an issue once you're going any kind of speed. I never see this on the geometry specs from manufacturers, but definitely worth checking. You can get used to moderate toe overlap, though.</li>
<li>Longer <strong>chainstay length</strong> gives you more heel clearance for loading panniers on the rear rack. I know from personal experience that the most likely place to kick a pannier off the rack is in an intersection, so if you plan to carry panniers this can be very important. Short chainstay length can be compensated for by getting a rack that allows panniers to be mounted further back (longer top, top further back, however they do it).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Handling characteristics</h2>

<p>First off, the way a bike handles, ""stability"" and ""maneuverability"" are essentially opposites. It's a tradeoff. Whether you want stable or maneuverable depends on what you're going to do with the bike, how fast you'll be going, your riding experience, etc. And there's some more complicated harder-to-understand secondary effects.</p>

<p>I really think that for most of the handling stuff you're best off just test-riding bikes that fit you. Experiment with the handling. Try going slow. Try going fast. Try making a sharp turn. Try making a subtle turn. Try a dodge/weave. Try those turns at different speeds. Try a fast start. Try a fast stop. Try all that in all the handlebar positions. Unless you're designing a bike, a lot of this is all very theoretical, heavily interrelated (can't really change one variable without changing the others), and likely to be very small differences when comparing actual bikes.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bottom Bracket (BB) height</strong> (sometimes you can find this out, sometimes you have to make a guess based on wheel+tire radius minus BB drop).  Higher bottom bracket makes it easier to go over stuff. Not really an issue if you stick to roads, but can be a factor when trying to pedal through sharp turns. Higher BB also lets you use longer cranks which some people want. Compare a Cyclocross to a Road bike and the CX bike will have a higher BB.</li>
<li><strong>Wheelbase length</strong> (distance between hubs/contact patches). A longer wheelbase will make the bike more longitudinally stable. In other words, less prone to wheelies and less prone to flipping you over the handlebars.  This could theoretically translate to better ability to stop faster. Note that one way to give you a longer wheelbase is longer chainstays. The position of your center of gravity makes a big difference, too.</li>
<li><strong>Headtube angle</strong> (steering axis angle). A shallower (more pointed forward) angle gives you more trail. A shallower angle also increases how much the weight can make the wheel flop on its own and negatively affect stability at low speed. This is usually measured from horizontal, so a steep angle will be closer to 90&deg; and a shallow angle will be a lower number.</li>
<li><strong>Fork offset/rake</strong> (how far the front hub is in front of the steering axis). More offset gives you less trail. More offset also tends to give you more toe clearance.</li>
<li><p><strong>Trail</strong> is how far the front contact patch is behind the steering axis. Note that while the trail is the important measurement, the headtube angle and fork offset (and wheel size) are what determines the trail. A bicycle with no trail would be unrideable (but many people like having very little trail).</p>

<p>There's different ways of measuring the trail (along the ground, or perpendicular to the steering axis) that make comparisons more intuitive, but more trail means more stable, and less trail means more maneuverable. Or to put it another way: less trail means more twitch and more trail means less responsive.</p>

<p>The stability from trail increases as the bicycle goes faster. If you look at some cruiser bikes they'll tend to have a shallow headtube angle and a lot of trail: they're stable and easy to balance at low speeds but probably hard to steer at high speed. If you look at a road/racing bike, the headtube angle is usually much closer to vertical and the trail is fairly small: they may feel unstable and wobbly (hard to balance) at low speeds, but are still easy to steer (responsive) at high speeds.</p>

<p>Note also that the handlebar setup and rider preferences/experience make a huge difference whether your prefer maneuverable/twitchy/responsive or stable/unsteerable/unresponsive.</p></li>

"Type of cycle for losing weight and staying fit for a beginner","15206","","<p>Over a year ago I was diagnosed with a collapsed arch in my left foot and despite trying many times I have not been able to get back on the treadmill. I have been thinking of getting a bicycle to start losing the weight that I have put on. I currently weight 240 lbs. I have a couple of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I get a hybrid bike or a mountain bike or a road bike? I have read conflicting views on what is better for weight loss and general fitness.</li>
<li>Should I buy a geared or a non-geared bicycle?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not looking to become an expert rider and would probably only ride 3-5 times a week. I just need something that will get me a bit of fresh air and help me loose a bit of fat.</p>
","<ol>
<li>You want a geared bike -- not necessarily 50 speeds, but at least 3, preferably 15 or so.  If derailleur-style bikes scare you, there are geared hub bikes available (though they tend to be a bit more expensive).  (But, honestly, there's nothing to be afraid of with a modern derailleur-style bike, if properly maintained.)</li>
<li>If you're only going to be riding on roads and paved trails (which is most likely the case, at least first year or so), the type of bike makes little difference, so long as it fits you appropriately and is comfortable to handle.  (Though at your weight a ""full suspension"" bike is probably not a good idea, and, in general, even front suspension is not of much use on roads).</li>
<li>Mainly you should pick a bike that fits you well and is comfortable.  You need a 10-20 minute ride to really check this out, and any bike shop that won't let you do that (within reason) you should avoid.</li>
<li>Be wary of the handlebar.  Most bikes are delivered with the handlebar too low, and modern ""threadless"" front bearing setups require adapters to raise the handlebar to an appropriate height.  Make sure you get the handlebar height set appropriately before you leave the shop, and go back if it seems to need changing.</li>
<li>Be wary of the seat.  Many ""comfort"" bikes (which are worth considering) will come with an enormously wide seat, which may seem wise at the beginning but quickly chafes the inner thighs.  You don't want super-narrow, but likely not super-wide either.  (Of course the seat can be changed fairly easily.)  And, while purists sneer at gell-filled seats, they can be more comfortable for rides of intermediate length (over an hour, say), so long as they're not too ""squishy"".  Stay away from the pillow-like foam seats, however.</li>
</ol>

<p>And do get a comfortable helmet (be wary of those with a large visor in front, they often obscure the vision), and whatever lock seems appropriate for your area/needs.  And be sure to get a light set if you ever ride at night -- nice LED light sets are now available quite cheaply.  </p>

<p>As for shoes, usually a pair of athletic shoes is good for starters -- just avoid anything that's too wide due to lots of extra rubber on the sides of the soles.  Or an old pair of leather shoes will work for starters.  With your arch problem it's probably best to avoid anything with a too-thin, too-flexible sole, but hard-soled bike shoes are probably unnecessary, and could be counter-productive.  (I have polio-weakened ankles and arches and I biked for decades (including several multi-day tours) in plain old ""tennis shoes"".)</p>

<p>The shop where you buy the bike should give you a free tuneup after the first month or two.  Discuss this when you buy the bike.  If you buy a used bike from a private party most shops will do tuneups for a very nominal fee, often free, just to encourage your business.</p>

","<p>You can do that, the spacing is the same.</p>

<p>As already pointed, you're going to have a ""phantom gear"" on your shifter.</p>

<p>If you let gear number 2 on the shifter correspond to gear number 1 in the cassette, you should take care not to press too hard on the lever when you are already in gear 2, since this should overstretch the cable or the lever.</p>

<p>If you let the normal order until gear 7, and have an 8th gear on the lever as an ""empty"" or ""ghost"" gear, there is no danger to overstretch anything, but the shifter cable might become too loose, to the point of the housings coming out of their stops.</p>

<p>Anyway, the gear spacing is the same, and there would be any necessary damage in any part, except one of the positions of the shifter not being used.</p>

<p>I promise that I'll go out and practice somewhere quiet ... </p>
","<p>Here are my snippets of advice from when I learnt to trackstand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start off by practising on a slight uphill. This way you only need to practice the forward pressure part of the movement. As you get better you can move on to smaller and smaller slopes. In urban riding, you can often use the camber of the road as your slope.</li>
<li>Use the right gear. Not really an issue with a fixie, but on a bike with gears you want a gear that is in about the middle of the range. Too low a gear will give you too much leverage and you will tend to over correct. Too high a gear and you won't have enough leverage to move the bike easily.</li>
<li>I find it easier to track stand standing up, pedals horizontal with my good foot forward and with the saddle braced between my thighs. Later you can progress to seated trackstands.</li>
<li>If the bike starts to lean towards the direction that you've turned your front wheel, then a slight pressure on your leading foot should shift the bike back under you.</li>
<li>If the bike starts to lean in the opposite direction, then you have to ease off the pressure on your front foot and let the bike roll back down the hill slightly. This is probably the trickiest part to get the hang of as it is a fairly unnatural backwards motion at first, but once you get the hang of it your trackstands will progress well.</li>

<p>The 28mm tires I've used are good for commuting (I think the 25mm I have is too small — I have to give it too much attention when crossing curb lines and such).</p>

<p>That said, 32mm tires offer a lot more protection in urban environments. I ride suburban roads (25mm is fine for those) into an urban environment, and then I go into a college campus.</p>

<p>It is on campus where the 25mm tires get dicey. There are many different surfaces on campus, and each change creates an edge — It is those edges that will get you, either trip you up or cause a pinch flat.</p>

<p>A 28mm tire does OK, but a 32mm tire handles these conditions much better.</p>

<p>Some 32mm tires are heavy, some are lighter weight. For what you hope to do — go fast — search around for lighter weight tires (Panaracer might be a good place to start).</p>

<p>Enjoy the fatties!</p>

"Are road-bike suspension forks still manufactured, if so, where?","14984","","<p>For a few years, road bike suspension forks were used at Paris-Roubaix, but now they seem to have disappeared. Are they still being manufactured? If not, why (aside from UCI regulation) did they not persist, e.g. for cyclocross or city riding?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TFq1F.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The Rockshox at Paris Roubaix were a Greg LeMond thing. Whatever Greg competed in a few 'out there' cycling innovations came along with him. Remember those tri-bars that gave him the aero tuck position to beat Laurent Fignon in the Tour de France? On that event he also had his own road bars that had an extra position, where the drop handlebar end plugs would be, his bars turned in 90 degrees to give an extra lower position. Anyway, it was his Team-Z that introduced the Rockshox on Roubaix. Seems that your well chosen pic duly notes his special handlebars, the Rockshox and 'Team Z'.</p>

<p>Greg's bars and forks were not widely adopted although his time-trial bars most certainly were. In any evolutionary process some mutations just don't work. As for the forks, the problems with them were that they were heavy, the brake touched the rim and they introduced 'sloppiness' in the front end. Imaginably these problems would be overcome but they were not. I don't think UCI regulations had anything to do with it, the product at that time was just not that good. MTB forks were a bit dubious too back then, only when the disk brake came along did the 'brake rub' problem get properly solved.</p>

<p>There are plenty of 700c forks on hybrid bikes from mainstream manufacturers, generally of the low-end 'Suntour' variety with a spring that does the work instead of any sophisticated oil/air arrangement.</p>

<p>You might want to go to a bike shop and do your own compare and contrast of the bikes with 700c suspension forks. The travel is around 50mm or so and there generally is no adjustment on them. I think Trek do a few models with them, Giant did too on the more expensive 'Expression' models. Although experiences are subjective, I found that along gravel trails the hybrid with no suspension felt better than the efforts with suspension. I wondered if the suspension was doing anything at all, it did not float over the bumps like a full-suspension mountain bike does and there was no real cut in handlebar vibration.</p>

<p>Here is a Suntour offering with coil spring, preload adjuster and lockout. This model is typically found on things like deluxe Trek hybrid bikes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X1fOT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The brakes are V-brake, the hole in the top of the brace is for mounting a reflector and you cannot put a nice set of road brakes on there. Other versions of this low end fork exist for roller cam brakes, which you obviously do not want!!!</p>

<p>There are some more desirable models made by Suntour for cyclo-cross and the hybrid market with 'proper' air adjustment and rebound, maybe even remote lockout. I am not sure if these models are OEM only or if you will be able to get hold of them locally:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bAQnF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As for Cyclo Cross, checkout the Suntour NRX models, with disk and all the sophistication you could wish for in 700c:</p>

"Spokes loose on a new wheel, is this expected or a bad build?","14787","","<p>So a couple of months ago, I bought a new front wheel from the local bike shop. It's a 28 spoke wheel, rims are the DT Swiss RR465 and the hub is a 240s.</p>

<p>I put 500-600 km on it and noticed a rattle after a ride. After isolating it to the wheel, I noticed that 3 of the spokes were extremely loose with one of them basically hanging. (The nipple/screw thing appears to be inside the rim somewhere.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm pretty sure I didn't hit anything and I'm not a terribly large guy. Are there things that can happen to new wheels/spokes, stretching or coming loose? Or is this a case of the LBS basically doing a crap job of building the wheel?</p>

<p>I'm nearly positive I didn't do anything wrong here, but I'd like to know if there was any possible user error.</p>
","<p>Apart from an impact, if it's been twisted in a bike stand wheel slot or something that could cause loose spokes. But usually loose spokes on a near-new wheel is just a bad build - if the spokes haven't been stress relieved properly they'll generally untwist as you ride it. And some wheelbuilders don't use a spoke tensiometer so regularly produce wheels that loosen over time.</p>

<p>Either way, take it back to the shop and ask them to fix it. When you collect it after they fix it, pay very close attention the very first time you put weight on the wheel. The first revolution with load on it is crucial - if you hear pinging noises that is the spokes untwisting themselves as the tension goes off them (the ones at the bottom have less tension due to your weight pushing down, so there's less resistance to them untwisting). That means the wheel hadn't been stress relieved properly (because you just did it), so the spoke tension might not be correct any more (and the wheel might no longer be quite true). If the problem happens again take it to someone different - someone who can't fix a wheel they built is not worth your time.</p>

<p>In more detail: as a wheel is built or trued each spoke nipple is turned. Because there's friction between the nipple and the spoke, this tends to twist the spoke as well as tightening or loosening the thread. Stress relieving means (gently) applying force to the wheel to momentarily loosen each spoke, allowing them to spring back into the non-twisted position. This slightly reduces the spoke tension, and may even unscrew the spoke slightly out of the nipple causing further loss of tension. So after stress relieving a good wheelbuilder will recheck the spoke tension. </p>

<p>EDIT by an anonymous user: Bladed spokes shouldn't twist because as they are built they are held with a tool which does not allow that.</p>

<p>A good wheel is not just true, it has even spoke tension. Over time uneven spoke tension tends to pull the wheel out of true, and the tight spokes are more likely to break in an impact, while the loose ones are more likely to break from metal fatigue. There's much discussion of this online, and <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0960723668"" rel=""nofollow"">Jobst Brandt's ""The Bicycle Wheel""</a> is a deceptively concise but detailed explanation of a lot of the issues. It's worth buying a copy if you're interested in wheelbuilding (I don't get anything out of you buying the book, I just think it's an excellent book).</p>

"Broken rear axle. Why does it happen and is it worth trying to repair?","14775","","<p>So I'm taking the time during the holidays to overhaul my commuter bike. The whole drivetrain was full of old oil, road salt and grime so I decided to take the whole thing apart starting with the back wheel. Once I got it off, I ended up with half of the rear axle in my hand and a bunch of ball bearings on the floor (I found them all eventually). </p>

<p>The bike has been in use for about 18 months, and there were no rust and plenty of lube inside the hub so I don't really think it's natural wear.</p>

<p>What could have caused the axle to break? My theory is that they pulled the nuts too tight when they built the bike.</p>

<p>More importantly, is this a ""user serviceable part"" or do I need to get it repaired/replace the wheel? Seems to me getting the ball bearings to stay in place while I insert the axle would be quite challenging.</p>
","<p>Most of times the axle is broken when not accurately jumping with bike (the same is with obstacles on road like holes and speed bumps). Wheels with freewheel are more exposed to this because their bearings (i.e. the place where wheel touching the axle) far from the place where the bike touch the wheel, therefor it have more moment to brake the axle.<br>
To the question about worth repair. The only available repair of this - is to put a new axle, that means it will be like a new wheel (if you do not have other problems in your wheel). If you going to replace the axle, examine the bearings cup if it have any deformation. If it have, in most cases the wheel must be replaces. Examine also the cones.</p>

"Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting?","14772","","<p>I really don't like indexed shifters, at least on the front. They're harder to adjust, more sensitive to cable stretching, and limit the number of gear combinations you can use (because you can't adjust the front derailleur cage manually to not rub on the chain).</p>

<p>So.. why are they impossible to find these days?</p>
","<p>There is no 'conspiracy' to keep friction shifters off the market just so that you have to buy the index shifters. It is simply a matter of supply and demand. Nobody in the OEM market wants friction shift gears because bikes with friction-shift simply do not sell. That leaves the after-market and you have a similar position there - the demand does not exist amongst people building up bikes/repair old bikes.</p>

<p>One reason why the replacement part market does not exist is that friction shifters rarely break, even 'back in the day' they were not a common spare for shops to stock in depth.</p>

<p>As for your front-shifting problem, you do have the outer cage 'flat-bit' parallel with the chainset and clearing the outer ring by all of 1-3mm? Without that accurate positioning it is unlikely you will get your front mechanism to work. New cables help, and if you follow the Shimano/SRAM/Campagnolo manual to the letter, making sure no dropouts or derailleurs are bent, you will have a chance of getting optimal shifting.</p>

<p>I know that a simple shift-lever adjustment would be easier, but that is progress for you.</p>

","<p>If it's not broken, don't fix it. The act of folding ourselves onto a bicycle, (especially one with any kind of aerodynamic advantage over a mountain bike) is not a natural-looking position for a human body. We're built to be more or less upright, which is not an aerodynamic position on the bike.</p>

<p>So, if you're comfortable on your bike and feel like you're ok with the amount of wind-resistance you create for yourself, and your bike is properly sized for you, there's not much you'd really want to change.</p>

<p>A couple of general bike position loose guidelines (yes, general and loose are a bit redundant here, but these are not hard fast rules):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you look down at your front hub while riding, you want it to be somewhere in the vicinity of being hidden by your handlebar.</p></li>
<li><p>For a commuter bike, you want to be able to look forward (with your head more or less erect) without feeling like you're craning your neck.</p></li>
<li><p>In said upright-head position, you shouldn't have to stretch for your handlebar.</p></li>
<li><p>Your seat should be at a height such that your leg is mostly extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke, but you should <em>not</em> have to rock your hips at all during the bottom of the pedal stroke.</p></li>
<li><p>Your seat should be situated fore/aft such that you can do the following:
a. Tie a weight on the end of a string.
b. Hold the non-weighted end of the string in the slight hollow on the outside front of 
 your knee.
c. The string should fall close to the spindle of your pedal when that pedal is at the 
 front of the stroke (3 or 9 o'clock, depending on how you look at it)</p></li>

"Can I use a 9-speed shifter with a 8-speed cassette?","14719","","<p>I'm looking into replacing shifters on my MTB. Currently I have 8-speed Shimano Alivio shifters - will 9-speed Deore or SLX shifters work? I do not care if one of the shifter's position will be unreachable.</p>

<p>Later I may replace the cassette to 9 speed to, but I do not want to do this right now.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately you cannot do that. The COGSET and the SHIFTER must have the same ""distance"", or more correctly, the same lateral distance (on the pulley) for each lenght of cable pulled (on the shifter).</p>

<p>When you go from 7 to 8 speed, the distance between cogs is the same (because the freehub shell is longer), so you could use a 7 shifter with an 8 cogset and one gear would be unreachable;</p>

<p>But when you go from 8 to 9 speed on the shifter, the expected distance between cogs change (because the freehub shell for 8, 9 and 10 speed is the same). Then you need a 9 speed cogset too, so that EACH shift will correspond to the CORRECT DISTANCE of lateral movement in the derailer.</p>

<p>If you move from 9 to 10, the same problem happens. That's a perverse kind of programmed obsolescence, in my opinion, since even cranksets end up being incompatible due to the chain being narrower and narrower... (look for the Sheldon Brown ""Nanodrive"" system).</p>

<p>So the bottomline is: if you want to replace shifters, you'll have to replace the cogset, and probably the chain and cranks. I would not advise you to do so only for the sake of shifter change. Consider doing it only as a last resouce.</p>

<p>(I for one never changed to the 9+ speeds framework. I have 5 bikes in current use, all of them with the ""7/8 speed framework"", and I can easily find spare parts like cogs. My 7 speed shifter (a very old Alivio) still works fine, and it seems to me it is very rare for the shifter to have a poor working only because it got old).</p>

","<p>My regular (commuting) bike is an old Cannondale mountain bike with road slicks. It's great for city riding, but it murders my back, crotch, hands, feet, etc. on long trips.</p>

<p>So, a couple years ago I bought a Bacchetta Giro 26 recumbent bike specifically for a 2000+ mile ride. I've used it since for rides of longer than a day. So here's my two cents:</p>

<p>Comfort: Riding a 'bent consists of sitting in a lawn chair doing leg-presses all day. IMO, no diamond frame bike (DF) will ever come anywhere close to matching a 'bent for comfort. Over the last week of my trip I rode back-to-back-to-back-to-back 110+ mile days with no issues other than some soreness in my knees. Best of all, you can look at the scenery instead of the asphalt, without craning your neck. This is a massive plus.</p>

<p>Safety: The bike I bought has 26"" wheels front and rear. My head is a few inches lower than on a DF, but I've never had any issues with visibility. I rode through several major metropolitan areas in fairly heavy traffic and never felt unsafe or invisible.</p>

<p>Dork factor: Everyone is fascinated by the bike. Everyone. I had a Hell's Angels looking dude shout ""nice hog"" at me at one point. Lots of people ask if I built it myself. One guy pulled over to take a photo. Every single person who has remarked on the bike has been enthusiastic and friendly, with one (group) exception: spandex-clad road riders, who generally pretend they don't see me.</p>

<p>Hills: Climbing hills on a 'bent isn't all that tough. It just requires persistence. You won't blast up a hill, but you can climb for hours on end. The biggest negative is that on a steep hill, if you stop for any reason, it can be damn near impossible to get going again. Also, balance becomes an issue at very low speeds.</p>

<p>All that said, 'bents are ideal for touring, so-so for daily utilitarian use, and of course illegal for racing. Of those three uses, touring is the rarest, and it's pretty hard to build a market around something most people don't do. </p>

<p>It's a pity, IMO — 'bents are a lot of fun, but most folks will never know it. But then again, I've got mine and get a lot of use out of it. If other people miss out, that's their problem, not mine. I expect most recumbent riders feel the same way.</p>

","<p>Lean the bike slightly against something with the derailer facing out.  Slide a section of newspaper up behind the derailer and large cog and let it drape down over the tire and onto the ground.  (This protects the tire and absorbs most of the solvent.)  </p>

<p>When it's sufficiently clean (ie, no longer caked with congealed crud) wipe it dry and lubricate with chain oil.  (Since this is usually done in tandem with a chain cleaning, simply oiling the chain will usually oil the derailer sufficiently.)  </p>

"Installing a rigid fork on a commuter MTB","14627","","<p><strong>Motivation</strong>:<br>
<a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/13652/3927"">This answer</a> says that installing a rigid fork on a frame, designed for a suspension, changes the geometry. Most answers to <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/12450/badly-rusted-suspension-fork"">my question about rusted-out suspension</a> recommend installing rigid suspension for riding in the rain and snow.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong>:<br>
What changes to the feel of riding should I expect when changing a low to medium (80-100mm) travel suspension fork for a rigid fork? My bike is this one:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmyD9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Unless the correct fork is chosen , the bikes geometry will change. A rigid fork built for a bike designed for rigid forks has a smaller axle to crown measurement than a suspension fork. If your bike is designed for 100mm travel suspension, and you put ""any old"" rigid fork on, the front of you bike will be 100mm lower than it is now. Even if you correct this in the Steerer/stem/handlebars, this will be enough to upset the rake and therefore alter the handling of the bike.  (refer @Benzo for the answer to this problem) </p>

<p>The bike will (should) be significantly lighter with the benefits that go with that.</p>

<p>If you are riding smooth pavement, the changes will be you feel more bumps, and need to use you arms to absorb and control the front of the bike if you hit small bumps in corners. Tyre choice and pressure becomes more important, as does attention to the surface ahead of you. The big gain is that you bike is more efficient - no soft squashy absorbing energy in the front end (even locked out suspension moves) - you will go faster. </p>

<p>Off road riding is a completely different ball game. If you are used to suspension and riding bumpy ground hard, you will need to change you style. Expect a few prangs along the way. When riding suspension, you weigh it in corners and let the shocks hold the front wheel on the ground over the bumps. Without suspension, the same technique will lead to the front wheel bouncing and loosing traction, with predictable consequences..... You need to learn to let your arms become the suspension, and your arms need to control the front wheel no only in direction, but ""height"" and ""pressure on ground"". The term ""loose"" takes in a new meaning. It requires more skill and concentration, and far more attention to detail than riding a suspension setup give, as well as being physically harder, but also in some ways, more rewarding.  </p>

Can I buy it?","14604","","<p>I have a pile of old patch kits for inner tubes that are complete except for the little tube of ""vulcanizing solution"" that comes in patch kits. With time, these tubes crack, or have a cap fail to seal perfectly, and dry out completely. I would love to be able to buy a larger container of solution.</p>

<p>Vulcanizing solution appears and smells like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_cement"" rel=""noreferrer"">rubber cement</a> but I've seen suggestions that rubber cement simply contain similar solvents and/or polymers. None of my patch kits describe the chemicals in the vulcanizing solution tubes.</p>

<p>What is vuncalizing solution made of?</p>

<p>Can I obtain it in quantitites larger than a tiny tube in a patch kit? Could I make it? Can I at least obtain larger quantities of the little tubes?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.rematiptop.com/parts.php?sid=2"">The manufacturer</a> sells said ""vulcanizing solution"" in quantities of 25g tubes through 1 gallon cans, so you should be able to buy it in larger quantities.

However, as many of the reviewers on Amazon point out, an 8 oz can should be a lifetime supply, and won't dry up nearly as quickly as those little tubes.</p>

Checking the <a href=""http://www.rematiptop.com/technical/trm/msds/RTT-TRM-018-Cold-Vulcanizing-Cement-021814.pdf"">MSDS</a>, we find only that it consists of 40-70% trichloroethelyne, an organic solvent. That doesn't really solve the problem, as that's just the solvent used.</p>

<p>To address the question of rubber cement, if we follow your link to Wikipedia, we find that it's generally a non-vulcanizing cement, while the tire patch stuff definitely claims to be vulcanizing.</p>

<p>Moving on, we can think about what the traditional solution to closely held trade secret formulas is. And the tool that was designed to solve that, though only does so imperfectly, is the patent system. Maybe we can find something in a patent filing.</p>

<p>A quick check over on Google Patents yields something promising, <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US3477968?dq=cold+vulcanizing+cement&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mQtCU8eTMaXYyQHh54CIDA&amp;sqi=2&amp;pjf=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA"">Cold self-vulcanizing rubber compositions</a>; however, upon reading the patent, it's a three part mixture, and the process involves things like ""the rubber used is a natural rubber, partially depolymerized by mechanical working and peptization with diorthobenzamidophenyl."" I don't know about you, but peptization with diorthobenzamidophenyl is not exactly something I feel like trying to cook up with common household substances in my basement.</p>

<p>Reading further on, we find some further promising patents like <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/WO2008147413A1?cl=en&amp;dq=cold+vulcanizing+cement&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mQtCU8eTMaXYyQHh54CIDA&amp;sqi=2&amp;pjf=1&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw"">Tire repair with cured patch</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US4618519"">Tire repair by ""patch only"" method</a>, but they all also involve discussions of the following form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suitable vulcanization accelerators include, but are not limited to, thiazoles, sulphenamides, guanidines, thiourea derivatives, amine derivatives, and combinations thereof. Examples of these include, but are not limited to: N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl sulfenamide (CBS), dibenzylamine (DBA), N-N'-diphenylguanidine (DPG), Dicyclohexylamine (DCHA), 2-mercaptobenzothiozyl disulfide (MBTS).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as references to entire books on rubber and the process of vulcanization: 'Rubber Technology, edited by Maurice Morton, Chapter 2, ""The Compounding and Vulcanization of Rubber,"" 3rd edition, 1987'</p>

<p>None of these appears to have any kind of description of a single readily available material or combination of a few that could be mixed together to work; they all appear to be fairly intricate, specialized compounds consisting of a variety of ingredients.</p>

<p>So I think that the 8oz can on Amazon is probably your best bet. I've heard some people claim you can just use regular rubber cement, but given that there are big cans of the ""vulcanizing solution"" readily available, my instinct would be to go for that.</p>

","<p>Are the holes always on the tread side of the tube?  Do you often go over curbs or other large bumps with the bike?  The possibilities are:</p>

<ol>
<li>you're damaging the tube when you change/patch it</li>
<li>you're running over a lot of thorns/tacks</li>
<li>you're getting ""snakebite"" flats from running the pressure too low</li>
<li>someone has it in for you and is ""helping"" the tire go flat</li>
</ol>

<p>In any event, for that much weight on a road bike 60psi is the minimum you should be running -- I run 90-100 on my 700C-35s.  You should get Kevlar-belted tires -- much more puncture resistant -- and get tires that are rated to run at least 80psi.  And I'm wondering if 35s aren't a hair wide for 19 rims -- that may be contributing to snakebite punctures.</p>

"Fixed gear: slipping","14555","","<p>I have a single speed bike with a flip-flop hub and recently I decided to try out the fixed side.   When testing it out in the car-park I was applying backpressure to brake and found sometimes the mechanism slipping.  I tried and recreated it a few times but I could not tell whether it was something in the machine slipping or just the tire slipping on the ground.  </p>

<p>Is it normal for the tire to slip on the ground a little bit?  All I did was to loosen the bolts, flip the wheel over and swap chain, and tighten up the bolts again.  Is there any way it's possible to do the conversion 'wrong' or have slipping in the crank/hub?  I don't want to ride the bike on the road like this if it could be unsafe.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pWSmo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>It is absolutely possible to skid the back wheel, but you really need to be deliberate about it to do it. In this case, however, it sounds like you were applying back pressure to slow down and noticed something surprising, so it was not likely to be the tire skidding. It was probably the cog slightly loosening. </p>

<p>If you're going to apply any back-pressure at all, you must have a <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_tp-z.html#trackhub"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">properly installed lockring</a> screwed on after the cog. A lockring is a small device that has a reversed thread, so that it prevents the cog from unscrewing when reverse pressure is applied. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4fks.jpg"" alt=""Lockring""></p>

<p>The best practice is to ride hard for a while without applying <em>any</em> backpressure to make sure the cog is seated tightly into its threads, then tighten the lockring to make it hard flat against the cog.</p>

<p>Track cyclists sometimes skip the lockring because they usually don't apply much backpressure, but if you're riding on the street and using the pedals to brake, you need a lockring and it needs to be tight.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6MfLkwo__s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's a youtube video</a>. There are others. I don't agree with the video about using locktite (use grease instead). </p>

"Could I be pumping up my tyres the wrong way?","14553","","<p>I now have my first road bike. When I am pumping up the tyres with what seems like a sturdy pump (that you stand on and push with two hands), I can barely get to around 100 psi, even putting my back into it. Is this normal, or am I just weak? </p>

<p>Notes: Valves are obviously presta, which I 'unscrew' and depress to let a little air out before connecting the pump.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
","<p>I have had such experiences even at much lower pressures, (I ride diverse disciplines of mountain bike, so I use my tires around 40 PSI, but still...). I have found three main causes for inflation difficulty:</p>

<p>I will discard air leaks as this one is pretty obvoius.</p>

<p>1) Faulty valve: Some valves get somewow obstructed, and won't get air in as easily as it should. This has happen to me with three types of vaole: Schrader, Presta and Dunlop. To test for this, inflate the tube while it's off the tire. You should feel almost no resistance, since the tire is not there to build up pressure. The tube should inflate quickly. You can also try a different valve core (Dunlops are easily changeable, but not too widely used, Schraders require a special tool but are also easily changeable. Some presta valves are changeable but not all of them.</p>

<p>2) Pump design: Some pumps are simply, by design, not capable of much mechanic advantage, so it is harder for the operator to achieve high pressures. The force required to push down the pump's piston is the pressure in the chamber multiplied by the piston area, thus, a pump with a large area piston is harder to push, but, usually such pump will put in a bigger amount of air per stroke. As per my personal experience with a wide range of pumps, for a floor pump the best sacrifice is a pump with piston area of about one square inch (roughly one inch in diameter). It will be painfully slow for 2.5 downhill tires, but will easily pump the pressures required for road tires. (For my downhills I use a cheap pump that has a piston with 1.5 diameter, its quick, but you'd start to suffer at 45 or 50 psi).</p>

<p>3) (or 2.2 if wou will...) Flawed pump: This is somehow related to the previous point, but this reffers to some defect, design error, damage, wear, etc. I have used pumps that have restrictive hose, valve (almost any pump has a 'check' valve) or connector. If this is the case, sometimes these parts can be cnanged or modified, but most of the times, it's not worthy. To test for this, press the pump without anything attached. The pump should move freely, with almost zero effort and you should hear the air hissing out without restriction. In fact, you would not be able to exerpt any force donw the handle, it will quickly go down before you know it. If you <strong>can</strong> apply noticeable force, this may be the cause. This is more common with cheap pumps, but there are brands able to sell expensive ones from time to time. Restriction to air flow can also be due to debris that somehow got inside the air ducts or the valve. If the pump is serviceable with regular tools, then carefully disassemble it to check the hose, the connector and the valve or any other narrow air passages.</p>

<p>Naturally there are other issues tha can come up with a pump, but they are rather obvious and do not seem to be your case: such as piston seizure (It is difficult to displace the handle even as slow rate) or seal failure (gives the oposite symptom, you can not apply gerat force to the handle because the air is leaking out).</p>

<p>Perform some tests to discard possible causes: inflate someone else's tires with your pump, borrow a pump with different design as yours and use it on your tires. You'll easily find the culprit.</p>

"Are today's bikes ""better"" than a few decades ago?","14498","","<p>I'm looking to buy a road bike for commuting. There is a guy near me who finds older road bikes (e.g. from the 80's) and fixes them up. Are there downsides to getting an older bike (assuming it's had a proper tune up) compared to getting a bike released in the last year?</p>
","<p>The last major technological improvement in standard bicycles was indexed shifting.  The indexing part of this isn't that big a deal, but the feature also gives you the ability to shift under load (which <em>is</em> a big deal).  I'm thinking this change occurred in the late 80s, but my memory for chronology is poor.</p>

<p>Yes, since then we've gotten V-brakes, carbon frames, ""compact"" cranksets and a few other things, but they're not fundamental changes, just minor refinements (if that).</p>

<p>Re ""non-standard"" bikes, the biggest change has likely been the improvements in geared hubs.  These have gone from 3-speed, don't-dare-shift-under-load-or-you'll-wreck-it models to multi-speed or continuous models that <em>encourage</em> you to shift under load.</p>

<p>There has also been progress in recumbent technology, but I don't think there've been any game-changers (though I'm not up on this).</p>

<p>The main problem with a bike more than 15-20 years old is that replacement parts get harder to find.  In particular, if you buy an older bike you might want to buy a spare rear cluster right off, to have on hand.  And I wouldn't recommend buying a road bike with 27"" tires, since replacement tires (of the narrow ""racing"" variety) will be hard to find.</p>

"Does the inner tube affect the maximum PSI?","14496","","<p>If I have road tires that have a recommended pressure of 110 PSI and maximum of 120 PSI can I safely pump my tires up to that level or does the inner tube effect the maximum? </p>

<p>I currently have the tires pumped up to 90 PSI however the question <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2744/what-pressure-should-i-run-my-road-bike-tyres-at"">What Pressure Should I Run My Road Bike Tyres At</a> seems to indicate I should go for the full 110. </p>

<p>It feels when I'm pumping that it would be very hard to pump above the 90 mark and I am wondering if the quality of the inner tube (or a inner tube max PSI) could be the reason. Should I just go for it and try to pump it up to 110 PSI or am I best off leaving my tires at 90 PSI?</p>
","<p>The inner tube has no significant effect on max pressure.  The valve stem area is the only area sensitive to pressure, and in general the valve can withstand 200 PSI or better.  (And if you exceed whatever limit there is the result is ""catastrophic"" failure, not simply the inability to pump in more air.)</p>

<p>What it sounds like you're noticing is the geometry of the pump.  A piston pump has a compression ratio, just like a cylinder in an engine, and the max pressure that the pump can generate is that compression ratio multiplied times the 14 PSI of atmospheric pressure.  In general, pumps are designed either to move a lot of air at low compression ratio to fill low pressure tires quickly, or to move less air at a higher compression ratio to be able to fill high pressure tires at all (though more slowly).</p>

<p>Good quality pumps will be advertised with a stated maximum pressure, and you can fill tires reasonably fast to 80-90% of that max pressure, after which progress will slow to a crawl.  So when you shop for a pump you need to pay attention to that number.</p>

","<p>It sounds like your headset is not adjusted.  Your stem cap is used to adjust this.  Specifically, the more you tighten the stem cap, the tighter the bearings will get, and the less play you will feel.</p>

<p>Here is a picture from <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/headsets.html#threadless"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sheldon Brown's article on adjust headsets</a>:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ITNVA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My process for checking headset adjustment:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the headset adjust:

<ol>
<li>Grab the front brake with your left hand, and grab the interface between the frame and the top of the headset with the other.  This is the ""No Wrench Flats"" in the image above.</li>
<li>Rock the bike back and forth with the brake on.</li>
<li>If you can feel the top of the headset moving independently from the head tube, it probably needs to be tightened.</li>
<li>Pick the front end of the bike up by the top tube, and let the handle bars/front wheel/fork ""flop"" from side to side.  If they flop around loosely and don't bind up, you haven't over-tightened the bearings. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the headset is out of adjust:

<ol>
<li>Crack loose the stem Pinch Bolts.  Don't take the stem off, just get it loose enough to slide around.  When locked down, the stem will hold everything together, so we can't adjust anything.</li>
<li>Tighten the stem cap bolt (labeled as ""Top Cap"" in the images above) by about a quarter turn each adjustment and then check the headset again.</li>
<li>If you have over-tightened, back it off by an eighth turn and check again.</li>
<li>Once everything is adjusted, line up the stem with the front wheel and lock back down the Pinch Bolts.  </li>
<li>Give it one more quick check (nothing <strong>should</strong> have changed, but it takes two seconds, so why not?).  </li>
<li>Best part:  Test ride!  See how she feels.  </li>
</ol></li>

<p>Once you've gone through the process a few times, it gets to be very quick.  I usually check my headset ever week when I do a quick once-over of the bike.  </p>

"Moving tfrom Shimano 9- to Shimano 10- speed","14368","","<p>I'm thinking of changing the 9-speed Tiagra rear mech on one of my (road) bikes to something, still Shimano, but 10-speed.</p>

<p>The obvious replacements I'll need are cassette, right-shifter and chain. But I reckon because of the narrower chain I'm also looking at a new chainset and rear derailleur. However I think the front derailleur and left-shifter should be safe (still keeping the front mech the same). Ditto the bb, regardless of whether I need a new chainset</p>

<p>Has anyone actually done this conversion and is able to confirm (or put me right)? 
Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Decided in the end that going from 9- to 10- was too much to spend all in one go. But I used a service as an excuse to change the cassette (to a 9-speed ultegra) and the chain (dura ace) at quite minimal cost. Can upgrade other parts as and when, although I'm basically looking at Shim's 6500 range here so all quite dated now.</p>
","<p>You will need a 10-speed cassette, 10-speed rear derailleur, and 10-speed right side shifter and a 10-speed chain to work with the narrower spacing on the rear cassette. There tend to be some compatibility issues with 9-speed derailleurs run on a 10-speed drivetrain (some people seem to have luck using 9-speed shimano mountain derailleurs with 10-speed shifters, but YMMV).  </p>

<p>Your 9-speed front chainrings should be fine.  <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/speeds.html#chainrings"">Sheldon seems to agree on that point</a> However, I wouldn't expect it to work on 8 or 7 speed chainrings, but it very well may.  I've upgraded my own 10-speed outer front chainring with a 9-speed one on a 10-speed Tiagra setup and haven't had any issues with it. There shouldn't be any issue with the left shifter, derailleur, or bottom bracket, those should be fine as well.</p>

<p>One other thing to consider is the brakes. 10-speed STI shifters may have a different lever pull ratio than the 9-speed levers, this may only apply to ultegra and dura ace though (please correct me If I'm wrong on this). So, you'll probably be OK if you're sticking with tiagra.  Otherwise, you may want to upgrade STI levers at the same time and possibly get brakes with a matching pull ratio. </p>

"Is it possible to compensate a short sized frame by adjusting seatpost and stem?","14340","","<p>Could you achieve the same position you would have on a bigger frame by raising seatpost and stem? And how could I adjust those to ""simulate"" a bigger sized frame?</p>
","<p>Any frame can support a range of rider sizes by adjusting (among other things) the seat post and stem.  However, as you might suspect, there are compromises to be made.  And, there are limits to how big of a rider can fit on a given frame.  I'll explain a bit more below to illustrate these points.</p>

<p>You can adjust the seat post by making it higher (may require a longer seat post than you currently have).  Also, some seat posts are straight, whereas others have a setback.  The later will move the seat slightly further back on the bicycle.  Setback is usually used to ensure that the rider is properly aligned over the pedals.  Whereas height is used to ensure that the ride achieves a proper leg extension.</p>

<p>Next you will want to consider the distance from the saddle to the handlebars.  The horizontal distance can be adjusted by getting a longer stem.  And the vertical distance can be adjusted by getting a stem with a different rise (the angle of the stem relative to the front head tube).  Therefore, you can achieve a wide range of positions.</p>

<p>However, thus far, we have basically ensured that the rider's legs are extending far enough and that his/her reach is correct.  If that were the end of the story, then you'd be able to have a single size frame fit everyone by using a very wide range of stems and seat post sizes.  Yet, if you shop the market, you'll find that each of these items tend some have a somewhat limited range of sizes available.  The reason for this is that once you go beyond these limits, you start running into other issues.  The rider's position begins to shift such that the center of gravity is too far in one direction.  The steering becomes harder to manage.  Or the drop (the vertical distance between the saddle and the handle bars) becomes too great making the bike uncomfortable to ride.</p>

<p>Tldr; For the best comfort and handling, stem and seat posts should be use to fine tune a bike's fit, rather than correcting for an otherwise improperly sized frame.</p>

"What's the most efficient riding style for losing weight?","14320","","<p>I plan on setting up my bicycle with one of those devices that holds the rear tire and gives some resistance so I can exercise through the winter.  I think it's called a bicycle trainer.</p>

<p>When using one of those for weight loss: Is it better to ride for a long time on low resistance or at a low speed?  Or is it better to ride harder, spinning your legs faster or with more resistance for a shorter amount of time?</p>

<p>Sorry; there isn't even an exercise tag on here.  Feel free to retag as appropriate.</p>
","<p>The answer to this question is dependent on a number of factors, but the short answer is just 'yes'. </p>

<p>If you are purely looking for weight loss then the equation is calores in minus calories out equals delta, and so long as the delta is negative, i.e. that you burn more than you consume, then you <strong>will</strong> lose weight. It's just simple arithmetic. </p>

<p>So, in the first place, just eat the same as you have ever done and do more exercise, then the weight <strong>will</strong> come off. </p>

<p>To do more training, though, will also require a balanced diet. If you up your training load without changing your diet, you will get more tired and notice other negative effects. You'll be hungrier, you'll eat more, it's not as easy as just upping the workload.</p>

<p>What you're actually asking is about making this weight loss more efficient, maybe even drastic, and getting the bang for your buck. So if you sprint, on a higher resistance, with higher cadence, then your heart rate will be higher and you'll burn more - but you'll be able to maintain it for less time. But if you try for a low cadence, with low stress, you'll maintain for a lot longer, but you'll burn less quickly. You'll lose weight either way, but you'll also do it differently and prepare your body differently. </p>

<p>To do this properly, you'll probably want to work just below the anaerobic threshold, this is the point at which the body is still able to consume enough oxygen to assist the work through using sustainable sources within the body (i.e. fat stores), but without all that pesky lactic acid being produced (and burning other sources, e.g. muscle). This is the point where many endurance athletes will try and aim their training (also known as LSD - Long, Slow, Distance), to sit for extended periods at a heart rate set at a maintainable point. You'll need a heart rate monitor and <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/998/how-do-you-calculate-aerobic-and-anaerobic-heart-rates"">a means to test yourself</a>. For a reasonably trained athlete, this will likely be around 150 bpm. </p>

<p>For what it's worth, my rule of thumb is that I'll burn about 40 calories per mile almost irrespective of speed ... but if you <strong>really</strong> want to lose weight, go running. I reckon I burn about 120 calories a mile when running. </p>

","<p>Fixed gears don't have as much tolerance for mismatched wear patterns as geared bikes, because there is no ""give"" in the drive train system.</p>

<p>The small amount of wear shown on the used cog is enough to cause this kind of noise in the case of a fixie. I'd be surprised if the same amount of wear caused you any problems at all on a geared machine.</p>

<p>It's also possible that the chain was over tensioned. I know you said that you use a tensioner, and that you didn't change the settings, but you used a new, unstretched, and therefore shorter chain. You may have needed to relax the tension by a small amount.</p>

<p>As you removed the wheel to change the cog, It may be that the tension has changed as well. Hard to say for certain, as you made the noise go away. </p>

<p>First off, the sloping tube (your second image) is known in cycling parlance as a compact frame. I found an article on the Giant web site about the advantages of a compact frame. When I say ""advantages"" - this is Giant's word not mine!</p>

<p>The full article is <a href=""http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-gb/technology/compactroad/57/"">here</a>, but to summarise it:</p>

<ul>
<li>the compact frame is smaller than the corresponding standard frame. Therefore, less material is used in the manufacture. Therefore, it is lighter.</li>
<li>Again because it is smaller, it is stiffer</li>
<li>With traditional designs, to stiffen the bike designers use stiffer materials which unfortunately makes the ride rougher. By using the natural stiffness of the frame, materials don't need to be stiffened hence the ride is comparatively smoother</li>
<li>because the top tube is lower, it is easier for cyclists to get a good fit</li>

","<p>I-spec is a Shimano-proprietary mounting system for Shimano parts. Its supposed to make mounting and adjusting brake+shift levers faster and easier by putting them on one mounting clamp. </p>

<p>I couldn't find a blurb on what it does / how it operates on the Shimano website, but the equivalent for SRAM is SRAM Matchmaker, which from their <a href=""http://www.sram.com/sram/mountain/technologies/matchmaker-x-integrated"">website</a>: </p>

<p>""The MatchMaker X clamp is more than just a clamp. It’s like having Martha Stewart tidy up your cockpit. Since each clamp accepts up to three controls, you can put everything from your XLoc suspension lockout, your SRAM shifters and AVID brake levers as well as your Reverb XLoc remote, all on two clamps. Short of genetically engineering longer thumbs, it’s the ideal way to put everything within easy reach. Just like Martha would.""</p>

"Why aren't hub/drum/roller brakes suitable for touring?","14196","","<p>I've got a Dutch town bike with Shimano IM80 roller brakes. They're brilliant. Maintenance free, clean, and effective. </p>

<p>I've been looking at getting a long range touring bike for an initial 3 month camping/hostel trip to Japan, and so I need a more suitable bike. It's probably best that I stick with what I know and like, but it seems that everyone says roller brakes just won't do it.</p>

<p>Why is this? Here's a summary of the issues and my initial thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li>""They can't cope with sustained braking on descent.""<br>
Is this because of temperature? The cooling fins on a Shimano IM81 roller brake are huge compared to disc brakes. Why is this a problem?</li>
<li>""They can't handle heavy loads.""<br>
I give lifts to adult passengers on the back of my heavy bike (a total weight of at least 150kg) and while braking performance is affected it's not catastrophic.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would really appreciate answers that address the technical performance and safety issues that mean hub brakes aren't recommended. I'm aware maintenance (particularly in the field), weight, interoperability, and style are other factors that need consideration independently from the operation. Thanks!</p>
","<p>Their main problem is your first bullet hypothesis: They can't cope as well with sustained braking on descent, as that is where brakes are challenged the hardest. </p>

<p>Even with the extra cooling fins, on a long descent, the brake may overheat, and may catastrophically fail. Riders using roller brakes have reported the brakes getting hot enough to ignite the internal lubricants inside the hub when making descents on tandems or loaded bikes. </p>

<p>Even if you had cooling fins the size of the wheel, you are generating heat inside the hub, and that heat has to travel out to the fins, which is surprisingly slow. Going down a mountain, you theoretically could have your hub start on fire, while the outer parts of the cooling fins could be cool to the touch. Disc brakes don't have that as the source of the energy is at the caliper which is on the outside of the rotors, but even then those have failed from overheating too.</p>

<p>The weight aspect on its own isn't too big a deal, even with heavy loads,
you can only slow down so much before you are completely stopped. However, when descending, you can drag the brakes and build up heat faster than it can be dissipated, and combining a descent with a heavy load doubles the demands on the brakes.</p>

<p>Ultimately, every bicycle brake system turns kinetic energy into heat, and has a maximum wattage it can operate at continuously. What increases the wattage is greater deceleration or greater loads.</p>

<p>If you were touring across Iowa, you'd be totally fine. Japan is pretty mountainous. If you are going to only be traveling where the terrain is pretty gentle, you'd probably be OK. If you are going into the mountains though, you'll want a different brake system.</p>

","<p>In the near term it's reasonably safe -- the dent is not sufficiently deep to seriously weaken the tube (though one does need to be concerned about the integrity of the welds on the rest of the bike, given it's been in an accident).  In the far term (10s of thousands of miles) there's danger that the tube will fatigue and become weakened at the dent.  (The thing to watch out for is growing cracks in the paint around the dent, or at frame joints, though some paints will hide cracks more than others.)</p>

<p>As to repair, about the only thing I can think of is to have an experienced frame builder cut out the section and weld in a new one, or fashion some sort of sleeve over the dent.  But those solutions would also be subject to long-term fatigue issues.</p>

<p>Conversely, women's bikes often don't have a top tube. Why is this? </p>
","<p>Frames designed for women do have that part - its called a top tube.   </p>

<p>Historically women wore skirts, so a lower frame in the middle made it easier to mount and dismount, and was less likely to accidentally show an ankle.</p>

<p>This picture shows a modern ""woman's frame"" with the top tube paralleling the downtube, and attaching to the seat tube lower down.</p>

</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bike is flexier because of fewer triangles</li>
<li>Bike is built heavier to reduce flex</li>
</ul>

<p>Another frame designed for with these positives is the Mixte frame, where the top tube is replaced by two separate tubes similar to chainstays and seatstays.  These pass around the seattube and terminate at the headtube and the rear dropout, increasing the stiffness of the bike.    They're still heavier than a normal Diamond Frame bike.</p>

"Mixing components: 105 and Deore XT","13926","","<p>When I bought my bike back in 1999, it was mounted on Shimano 105 except for rear derailleur and cassette which are Deore XT (all 9-speed, Hyperglide). The vendor then told me </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""..and you've got a Deore XT derailleur, more solid than the 105"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure Shimano won't suggest such combination however I wonder what kind of problem this can create. Shifter/derailleur compatibility? Chain/cassette compatibility? Cassette/hub fit?</p>

<p>NOTE: 105 was 9-speed in 1999.</p>
","<p>The Deore XT is a mountain bike derailleur and as such has is long cage dérailleur. Long cage dérailleurs can <a href=""http://forums.roadbikereview.com/components-wrenching/largest-cassette-short-cage-derailleur-215673.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">run larger cassettes</a> for a larger gearing range (at the cost of larger jumps between gears).  I don't know what the Shimano product selection was like in 1999, but you can now get Shimano 105 as either long or short cage depending on your set up (see images below). </p>

<p>As for Deore XT being more ""solid"" in 1999 we were running 105 short cage derailleurs on downhill bikes with a single front ring, so that we could run shorter chain lengths and have less chain slap.  The 105 derailleurs survived many crashes.  (<em>Speculation/Humour</em> - I personally suspect the shop was smoking some impressive substances, as was often the case with bicycle shop owners in the 90's)</p>

<h1>Compatibility Notes</h1>

<p>For more technical description you should see a previous bicycle.stackexchange question: 
<a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/7264/how-to-calculate-the-capacity-of-a-rear-derailleur"">How to calculate the capacity of a rear derailleur</a></p>

<p><strong>Short cage</strong> - Short cage dérailleur can only take up or let out so much chain slack.  Therefore your gearing setup may require more chain slack than your derailleur can give or take up.  For example on a double front ring (road bike) set up you can't have a rear cassette that has a cog larger than 27. That said, on the right setup the chain slack is tighter and shifting should be more precise.</p>

<p><strong>Long-cage</strong> - Long cage dérailleurs can take up or let out much more chain slack due to the longer pulley cage.  You can run a larger array of gears as a result.  The downside is that shifting isn't quite as precise and the chain isn't under as much tension and you are more likely to get chain slap on rougher terrain.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE: Since posting I have learned that there are now short, medium and long cage derailleurs.  Same basic idea still applies.</em></p>

<h1>Visual Distinction Between Short and Long Cage Derailleurs</h1>

"What are the consequences of riding a bicycle tire backwards?","13920","","<p>When putting a new tire on a bicycle, there is usually a note somewhere on the sidewall showing the direction the tire is supposed to rotate when you are on the bicycle.  However, the last time I changed my tire I already had the tire mounted on the rim and inflated before I remembered to check for this marking, and it turned out I had it backwards.  Rather than take the tire off and do the whole thing over again - or leave the tire to rotate ""backwards"", I opted simply to put the wheel on backwards, as it was the front tire and there did not seem to be anything dictating which side of the bike the quick release had to be on.</p>

<p>I have ridden about 20 miles so far without any issues, but I am wondering, what, if any, are the long term consequences of either this approach (riding with the tire backwards from the standpoint of the rim being backwards with respect to the quick release being on the opposite side from the back tire), or simply riding the tire in the opposite direction as labelled on the tire.  For the latter, I am wondering if it really makes any difference, because in my case I had to really search for the direction indicator as it was barely discernable.</p>

<p>I'm riding a road bike (touring geometry) and the tire itself is a long-life, hard casing type, as opposed to soft ""performance tire"" types which get flats more easily but are supposed to handle better.</p>
","<p>If it's a road tire, i.e. a slick, it makes no difference. The tire direction marks are usually printed on road tires because mechanics are so used to looking for them, that the makers may as well put them on there so as not to confuse or waste the time of the installer.</p>

Sometimes it helps to mix water and dish soap together and either pour that over the partially inflated tire, scanning for leaks or submerging the tire in a bucket of soapy water.

<p>Most bikers riding MTB specifically do not have kickstands. They simply drop a bike on the ground, or lean it somewhere, when they need to park it.</p>

<p>Why is that? Is the added weight really that much of a trouble?</p>
","<p>If, by stands, you mean bike mounted kickstands, then the reason most mountain bikers don't use them is three fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Safety. The kickstand is usually a relatively cheap piece of metal, bolted on wherever it will fit. Its shape and style lend themselves to ending up in your wheel or otherwise damaging the bike, if they are not secured to the frame so they can't accidentally deploy themselves while riding a rougher trail.</li>
<li>Weight. If I pay a ridiculously large amount of money to buy a light weight, high performance machine, the last thing I want to do is pay extra to make it heavier. So that does play a part, but I wouldn't say it was the key factor.</li>
<li>No need for it. As you mentioned, most riders are perfectly comfortable dropping their bike on the ground wherever they pause for a minute or two, and dealing with cleaning and fixing any damage that may cause when they get home.</li>

"Why is my freewheel slipping?","13705","","<p>My freewheel tarted slipping this week. It slips most from a stop with no pressure snapping to significant pressure on the pedals. Slipping may be the wrong term as it really isn't engaging. Once it ""hooks up"" and pressure is continuously applied there is no slippage.</p>

<p>Bike is a 3 years old, kona humu-humu, and used for daily commutes in Montana. Stored in an unheated shed at night, left out in the elements during work M-F 9-6, a couple times a month year round while out on the town.</p>

<p>Past couple months I've been hearing a banging sound out of the rear cog which I assumed was the chain slipping on the cog, but now I'm wondering if it the ratcheting mechanism in the freewheel. </p>

<p>Recent weather included a large snow storm which caked the bike in snow/ice followed by a week of sub 0F weather, so the snow stayed caked on. Two days ago riding it home after dark in like roughly -20F temps the issue first occurred. Thinking it was a chain slippage and being very intermittent I brought it inside got the bike warmed up/dry tighted the chain and did some other routine maintenance. </p>

<p>Next day, same issue occurs but easier to recreate while off the bike and I can see the chain is fine and the freewheel just isn't hooking up. </p>

<p>I have a couple theories but not how likely each is. I'm also not sure how serviceable the freewheel is. </p>

<p>Theories:
- Water worked it's way into the freewheel and is now frozen inside the freewheel. This is changing how the moving parts operate.
- The banging sound was the freewheel and is a sign of or the cause of major wear. The mechanism providing traction now has a loose fit and the extreme low temperatures are enough to further loosen the connection to unusable.
- It's too cold for the springs/oil in the mechanism to perform adequately for normal usage
- Something else?</p>

<p>I need to swing by the local shop anyways as I'm swapping out some parts shortly, but if there are some simple fix ideas I'd love to hear them.</p>

<p>EDIT: Freehub not freewheel + Single speed cog.</p>
","<p>Since this was mentioned in a comment, freewheels are not the same as freehubs+cassettes (see <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/free-k7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheldonbrown.com/free-k7.html</a>) for details. The rest of the discussion should hold if freewheel is replaced with cassette+freehub though with minor modifications - I don't know if this bike has a freewheel or a cassette+freehub since I can't load the product page. Freewheels and chains (which needs to be measured with a ruler, due to some issues with most chain checking tools according to Sheldon Brown), (and less frequently, the chain rings) are wear items - they don't last forever (and the ratcheting mechanism can go and make a lot of noise). In 3 years, you may have exceeded it in commuting depending on weather and mileage - Last freewheel I had lasted about 3500-5000 miles (some cheap sunrace freewheel) since I ran a while with a worn chain. You don't fix a freewheel unless you have to - theres a lot of bearings and what not which makes the complexity high. Buy a replacement freewheel and have it installed, and throw the old one away (and usually, thats a good time to replace your chain as well, though you should get at least 2-3 chains / freewheel). </p>

<p>I wouldn't call it a banging noise (I haven't thought of what a good description of what the noise would be), but hubs which need repacking or axle damage also do make noise, so you may want to check that too. You can also get a banging-clunking noise from a failing bottom bracket as well (which can lead to a slipping sensation), so checking the bottom bracket area is another thing to do (in doing this, you'll also have to check the cranks and pedals, so this is a bit of work). </p>

","<p>I'm going to see how many answers I can say this in today - don't overthink it.<br><br>
A 100mm full suspension 29er is going to be able to shred anything you can throw at it for a long time. That's a good amount of travel to start with, and on a 29er it's going to feel like even more while staying efficient. The epic has a really well balanced geometry as well. It's not too twitchy, and it's not so slacked out that you have to fight it through twisty slow stuff.<br>
Full squish 29ers are great 1st mtbs because they <i>are</i> so versatile. Plus if you end up really enjoying mtbing, then believe me, you will end up owning more than one bike down the road so don't sweat your decision- you made a good one.<br> 
While you own the one you have, swap with buddies, go to demo days, take advantage of opportunities to ride different styles of bikes instead of just guessing what type you think sounds good for your next purchase.<br>
Keep in mind that everything is a trade-off. More mm of travel equals more fun to point down technical descents, but less fun to get there, and less precise handling. Heavy big squish bikes can be really taxing for riding cross country, which I'm assuming is what you'll be starting off doing.<br><br>
Regarding your 2nd question, you can safely go up 20mm in the front (fork) although it will slack the geometry out a bit. The RockShox Reba that came installed on that bike can be converted to 120 by removing a couple of spacers inside the fork (it may only be 10mm of spacers that can be removed in newer models, ask your dealer). As for the rear shock, that's a bigger can of worms that you probably don't want to open.</p>

"Tire popping out of rim when inflating tube","13639","","<p>This is very similar to <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/13694/13446"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>When I fill my tubes up to about 85 psi the tire pops off the rim and the tub gets caught on the rim and blows up.  I have gone through 4 tubes in two days at this point and the only thing that seems to help is to inflate them to about 60 psi.  Even putting pressure on the tires so they seat correctly (not sure if that is the correct term, I am quite new to cycling) only works until I put weight on the bike, and then the tubes blow.</p>

<p>For some info, I frankensteined a bike together out of used/old parts so my rims are quite old (although relatively true after ~8 hours of work) but the tires are falling apart.  The rims are 27's (inches?) and there were really no options for newer ones at the place I put my bike together at, only 700's.</p>

<p>Could replacing the tires fix this?  I would like to get the tubes to around 90 psi since at 60 they are quite flat when riding.</p>

<p>Edit:  Some details on the tire, tube and rim.</p>

<p>Rim:  ~1 Inch wide at the top, ~25 1/2 inches in diameter<br>
I couldn't really figure out how to check the bead.
Rim tape looks fine, it is some hardish plastic covering the spoke screws.</p>

<p>Tire:  <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/v7l70#rGj7QpY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">See these images of the tire.</a><br>
Supposedly a 27 x 1 1/8 tire that holds 90psi.  Not sure what else is helpful info other than the pictures of the deteriorating side walls (and the lip at the bottom that catches the bead)</p>

<p>Tube:  700x18-23 27x1 48 mm presta valve.  I can't find max pressure, but I am sure it is in excess of 90 psi.</p>
","<p>Three things to check:</p>

<p>1, Is the bead seated correctly. It's pretty common to get tyres blowing off the rim if they're not seated correctly. That said, this usually leads to an exploding tube rather than the tyre just coming off
2, As Daniel R Hicks said, are the rims so worn they're expanding?
3, Check the rim for dings and warping as Malarky sort of says, but not just the area for the bead. You may have a bent rim</p>

<p>Chances are, though, that the tyres are done. The pictures would make me think they're on their last legs. I had a pair of 20+ year old ones recently that ended up in the bin as they just weren't reliable enough for me. Some things aren't worth saving a few euros/pounds/dollars over, and the contact points on a bike are some of those things for me. If the rims seem fine new tyres are where I'd go.</p>

","<p>Whatever works.  The main advantage of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_handlebar#Drop"">standard drop bar</a> is that it offers you multiple hand positions and multiple postures.  In a sprint, or driving into a headwind, riding fully on the drops cuts wind resistance, but for less intense riding one of the several hand position on the top bar or on the hoods is usually preferred.  And on long rides the ability to change positions from time to time is invaluable in terms of hand/arm/back comfort.</p>

<p>And there is no one ""right"" height for your bar.  If you're a real aggressive rider (and young and limber) then a lower bar position may be for you, but if you're somewhat more casual there's nothing wrong with raising the bar (so to speak).  And you may also want to consider adjusting your ""reach"" by changing the stem -- not everyone's torso is the same length.</p>

"Road bike carbon fiber frame life span","13587","","<p>I have read in several places that the carbon fiber has a shorter life span than the aluminium, and i was wondering just what would it be. 
I am not referring to accident related failures of the frame. I would like to know how much would a frame hold for a road bike if i didn't have any accidents and road it almost daily for lets say 10 miles.</p>

<p>I read somewhere ( sorry cant find the link ) that carbon fiber frames will tend to crack after 4-5 years.</p>
","<p>Absent some kind of abuse or extraordinary stress (like falling on top of the bike while it's lying on the ground - stressing the tubes from the side, riding with a friend sitting on the top tube...) a carbon fiber frame should outlast the rider.</p>

<p>Lennard Zinn covered <a href=""http://velonews.competitor.com/2002/12/technical-faq/technical-qa-with-lennard-zinn-carbon-forks-2_3270"">durability of Carbon Forks for Velo News</a> a while back.  Here are some quotes from that article in case the link breaks:</p>

<p>From Kestrel</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For carbon forks in
  general, there should not be any
  limited life span, as carbon
  composites themselves are not subject
  to fatigue failures as metals are. So
  the fatigue life of a properly made
  carbon composite is 'infinite'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Look</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no limitation because carbon
  has a natural flexibility. It can be
  used a hundred years while maintaining
  the same stiffness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Easton</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The good news is the fatigue life of
  carbon fiber is immensely more than
  that of metals. While the writer
  expresses concern about his carbon
  fork lasting as long as a metal
  component, there is nothing to worry
  about in terms of fatigue life on a
  composite fork.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having ridden since the early 80's I've been through this twice, once with aluminum frames and now with carbon fiber. As high end competition bikes were made of the materials there were questions of durability.  Over time, as the frames became widely available, those concerns were shown to be largely baseless.</p>

<p>I believe most frame builders warranty carbon frames for life now. I personally know of at least two riders with carbon fiber bikes that have been ridden in excess of 100,000 miles.</p>

<p>That said, you should periodically inspect the frame for cracks and wear, especially at stress points like around the bottom bracket (just like you would with any frame).</p>

<p>Initially I thought that this was not possible and I was looking at getting a custom Titanium frame made with the same components. I have now found a couple of options though.</p>

<p>There is the Tubus set of pannier racks. I have used a Tubus rack before on a bike with no eyelets and it seemed to work very well.

"Knowing what bicycle frame material I have","13428","","<p>I have a bicycle frame that's really heavy. It's a mountain bike frame with shocks, so I decided to replace the entire frame with a city bike aluminum frame(I only use the bike if I have to pick up/buy some stuff near home). How do I know if the frame that I replaced is a titanium/steel?</p>

<p>I got the bike as a present from my uncle almost 6 years back, I don't have an idea about the brand, it's just the entire frame is not your average frame, it's somewhat heavier than other bikes( I compared it with the aluminum frame I bought/ plus a couple of my friends bike)</p>

<p>What methods/techniques should I use to know what type of frame do I have?</p>
","<p>To identify a frame firstly see if a magnet sticks, if it does it's steel, if not it's carbon, aluminium alloy or titanium alloy.</p>

<p>If not steel look down the seat tube if it's metallic inside it could be aliminium or titanium if black and plastic looking, carbon. Tap the frame with a screw driver, aluminium and titanium will have a definite metallic 'tink' and carbon a hollow 'thunk'.</p>

<p>To tell the difference between alloys put a small scratch in the seat tube (both have good anti-corrosion properties) if the exposed metal is dark and dull silver it's possibly titanium, if light silver it's aluminium. Titanium frames are expensive and rare so not likely to come across one you don't know the pedigree of.</p>

<p>For steel there is a significant difference between the two main types of steel, Chromoly and Hi-Ten steel. Chromoly is a stronger and lighter (high carbon) steel and is generally found on mid to high end bikes. If a bike is reasonably modern and chromoly it is likely to have smaller diameter tubes and possibly seat post (although this isn't a good indicator as new steel frames are being produced to fit dropper posts). A chromoly bike may have a sticker on the seat tube from the tube manufacturer be it Reynolds, Tange or Columbus. Tube shape may also vary on higher end frames (my chromoly HT has a triangle top tube and oval down tube). A Hi-Ten frame will mirror the fashion of when the bike was made.</p>

<p>Few Chromoly frames come as built up bikes so generally if you don't know your riding Chromoly, a magnet sticks to the bike and it's heavy you're riding a Hi-Ten steel bike. The scrap value of the frame is probably worth more than the frame.</p>

<p>How many ball bearings should be inside? I thought there had to be just enough to fill the full circle, but a friend of mine told me I should fill the circle to it's fullest and then remove one ball.</p>

<p>The reason, he said, is that else there is to much pressure on the bearings.</p>

<p>Is this true? And is it true for all the axes (say, the ones in my wheels' hubs)?</p>

<p>And also, I'm putting vaseline (the yellow heavy duty variant) inside the axes, is that a good idea?</p>
","<p>The reason behind the ""full less one"" is that you need at least half the race full (rounded up) for it to work and performance improves with more balls past that point, but if it's too full you get a dramatic loss in performance. So ""full less one"" is an easy guide.</p>

<p>In practice most bearings spread a little as you tighten the cones so ""full"" when you're adding balls is not actually full in use. You can usually see this - when you're adding balls they generally sit in against the axle, then when you add the cone it spreads the bearings slightly. So filling the race is almost always fine.</p>

<p>Don't be tempted to add one more to fill in the extra space created when you tighten it up, this is exactly the situation the ""full less one"" guide is trying to avoid. That ""full plus one"" means all the load is on one bearing (and one section of the cone), plus the bearings are really grnding against each other as the wheel rotates. If you're lucky the wheel won't rotate in this situation, but if you're unlucky you're wreck the cups and have to replace the cups (or hub, if the cups are not replaceable).</p>

"Mini Pumps For Roadbike (120 psi)?","13335","","<p>I'd like to buy a mini pump to keep in my bike bag, but I have some doubts if these pumps are really that usable.

<p>How long does it take to pump up a tire with such a pump? Normally I use 120 psi, I haven't measured the minimal psi I would need to get home from a long trip, maybe around 100 psi.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to get one with a hose or a pressure gage? Probably they can't blow a tire anyway. 
Any other recommendations?</p>

<p>I prefer a pump to be prepared for multiple flats and not carry expensive cartridges, as well as for environmental reasons. It feels a bit frivolous to use two cartridges for a tire and throw them away afterwards. I am not a pro, just enjoy riding on the weekend.</p>
","<p>A longer frame pump is advantageous - a lot of them can be mounted along the length of your top tube and work a lot faster/easier than mini pumps. Mini pumps (and frame pumps in general) always take forever (at least, it feels like forever, though some are better than others due to chamber size and if they can inflate on the push and pull stroke of the pumping action among other design factors) and are tough at higher pressures. You just need to get enough air until you can get to a track pump - In theory and by design, you could probably get to full pressure with a good frame/mini pump but in practice, you may not due to tired-ness and other factors that come with a ride. The amount of time and effort it takes obviously depends on the volume of the tires and pressures you're running as well as how quickly you can pump. If you look at some reviews, you can probably find the highly variable measurement of how long someone took to pump their tire in ""pumps"". </p>

<p>When you use a hand pump like a conventional frame/mini pump, you lose the advantage of weight and upper body muscles you use with a floor (track) pump (aside from the typically smaller volumes) [but you can get this on the go to some extent with a frame-mounted floor pump]. The Lezyne Micro Floor Drive HP-HPG looks interesting as a small frame-mounted floor pump (similar to the Topeak Morph line, but oddly much cheaper and possibly more ergonomic) and according to a <a href=""http://road.cc/content/review/9073-lezyne-micro-floor-drive-hp-mini-pump"" rel=""nofollow"">review</a> does quite well on the pressure and inflation efficiency front. </p>

<p>I don't think a gauge is necessary, but a hose is useful - you avoid transferring your momentum of pumping directly to the valve, which can cause some damage if you do it too much (i.e. not careful). <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/flats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sheldon</a> has some tips for doing this (my current frame pump does not have a hose, but I do wish it did). </p>

<p>If you do get a mini pump though, try to get one with a CO2 inflator built in as well and carry some CO2 cartridges (or at least a mini inflator). Some day you may be too tired or in need of a quick inflate (e.g. in the rain), and this could really help you (though they can't do minor adjustments of a tire pressure like a pump can).  Also, try to avoid flats in the first place - kevlar belted tires, proper tire inflation, etc. will save you the agony of having to use your pump. And always have a way to get home otherwise (e.g. bus, calling someone, etc.). </p>

","<p>In my experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>You only need to apply a drop of glue a bit larger than a pea (about 7mm diameter) per patch;</li>

<li>(IMPORTANT) When you attach the cover of the tube, BE SURE TO REMOVE ALL THE AIR INSIDE by pressing its bottom untill half a drop shows up in the opening, otherwise the glue will evaporate inside the very tube (happened to me a lot of times until I figured it out...).</li>
<li>These glues have a volatile nature. I wouldn't buy it in large amounts, but rather to buy new spare glue tubes (without the whole patch kit). The kind of patch I use also have this problem: the patches (a small roll I have to cut with a scissor) last much longer than the glue.</li>

  excessively narrow rims. Such narrow rims work very poorly with wide
  tires, unless the tires are overinflated...but that defeats the
  purpose of wide tires, and puts undue stress on the rim sidewalls.</p>

<p>Now my question is: why is it (usually, if we leave the silly high-end prices alone) more expensive to build a bike from scratch?</p>
","<p>The sale price falls between what the customer is prepared to pay and cost plus. 
(If the cost plus is more than what the customer will accept, it's not worth doing business). </p>

<p>Complete bikes are a highly competitive market, and this drives the price down to very close to cost plus pricing. It's the high volume, low profit part of the business. The accessories and parts are the high profit part that keeps them going. </p>

<p>Bike parts are not competitive. Most bikes sold never get to see a new part except accident damage, and individual parts are relatively cheap, so the consumer cannot save that much by shopping around.  Most parts are sold and installed at shops and the labor cost will not change shopping around. Most consumers do not have the skills or desire to install parts themselves, let alone diagnose a fault. Even for the small percentage that replace worn out parts, shopping around is hardly worth the savings (unless you go online and buy on the world-scale market). </p>

<p>On a world scale, the likes of <em>wiggle</em> show just how much profit is in parts, yet they represent a very small percentage of bike parts sold. Most parts are sold and installed at shops. As such, they have little volume buying power and probably pay more for parts than the manufacturers, or pick up the end-of-life parts the manufacturers no longer make and stock. Have a look at wiggle stock - you will not often get exactly what you want - you will get usually something very close -  unless your bike is a year old - because they are an 'end of run' outlet shop. </p>

<p>Comparing to computers is not correct. If you look at what's happened, laptops and all-in-ones are a lot cheaper than boxes and the modern PC equivalent of the pre-assembled bike. Try building a laptop or all-in-one from parts and see what it costs. Your ""custom built PC"" is now the equivalent to that ""silly high-end""  bike.  Years ago, the market for parts for a PC was a very competitive one with many manufacturers.</p>

"Is it worth time to rebuild an old steel frame?","13174","","<p>I found an old Favorit racing bike. I didn't weigh it without all the parts but I find it pretty light, and it has a nice classic look. It is however really rusty (superficial damage only). Right now it's been rebuilt, and except for the very old and damaged crankset (which I'm going to change), it rides fine. </p>

<p>My question is: is it  worth it to repaint the bike and slowly rebuild it with higher quality parts? I'm not looking for the lightest bike, just a strong, comfortable and durable bike. Also, I like the fact that the bike would be unique and customized. Would I be better off buying a bike, or getting a better quality steel frame? </p>
","<p>You would undoubtedly end up with a ""better bike"" if you bought something new off the rack. I'm excluding BSOs because —by that very definition— they aren't bikes.</p>

<p>That might be a controversial viewpoint but it shouldn't be. There are a few basic reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Frame technology is objectively better now. Better materials and better designs. Even if <em>you</em> don't like soft carbon or hard 6061/7005 alloys, there are well-engineered solutions for everybody. In short, there is choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Restoring a frame can take serious time and equipment. If you aren't kitted out for metalwork and painting, you're going to spend a lot of money on this. If you aren't competent or you don't enjoy doing it, that's more expense.</p></li>
<li><p>Restoring <em>components</em> can be even harder. If you need to replace like-for-like springs and gears, you're in territory where things can get very expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're replacing components, consider that bike assemblers get their parts at <em>extreme</em> discount. A discount you probably won't be able to achieve without buying older second-hand parts.</p>

<p>So unless you can find a discount group- and wheel-set, a last-season stock-clearance bike will be the cheapest new-parts option. And that comes with a frame.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can boil that down to say: <strong>The monetary difference between buying a good bike and restoring an old one with new parts is <em>very</em> slim.</strong> If you consider the objective quality of the frames, components and your time, it can be even harder to justify.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other side of the coin, you have already identified value in the project. There is sentimental value, there <em>is</em> personal value in having something that is truly yours. This may also be an enjoyable hobby for a few months. That stuff means something.</p>

<p>But as soon as any of the {wheel,chain,group}-set need replacing, the <strong><em>monetary</em></strong> balance tips the other way. And the objective base quality of a 70s-80s steel frame is always going to be in question when you can compare it to a ~2015 frame.</p>

<p>In short, the only person who can answer this question is you. It all depends on how much value you derive from the process and outcome.</p>

<p>How do I tell if they will fit my bike? On the page for the SRAM calipers linked above, it says that they fit 28c tires, but in the questions sections, a person said they'll fit on 32c tires. How do I know if that's correct?</p>

<p>I can't find any size information whatsoever for the Tektros.</p>

<p>How do I make sure that any pair of brake calipers I purchase over the internet will be the right width, length, etc.?</p>
","<p>Road brake calipers are built with ""reach"" dimensions.  The reach is the distance from the center mounting bolt to the pads.  Usually this is a range of values (e.g., 47mm-57mm) as you can adjust the pad vertically within the caliper.  It is important you replace the caliper with another caliper of the same reach. <strong>If you do not get the appropriate reach you will not be able to position the brake pads to engage the rim braking surface.</strong>  </p>

<p>Generally, there are <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/brake-calipers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">3 common sizes</a> for road brake calipers.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>39-49 mm</strong> - ""short"" reach - Common on race road bikes, lower volume tires (e.g., 700x23c).  The   Tektro R540 (what you linked) has this reach.</li>
<li><strong>47-57 mm</strong> - ""long"" reach - more common on road bikes that slightly larger volume tires (e.g., 700x32c).</li>
<li><strong>57-76 mm</strong>  - ""Extra long reach"" - less common and found on more boutique frames which are designed to fit even larger volume tires or 700c to 650B conversions.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to determine which reach your current calipers are. Given the tire size of your current bike (700x32c), if I were to guess, it is likely option (2) 47-57mm.  </p>

<p>If you peruse <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/brake-calipers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sheldon Brown's web page on brake calipers</a> you can see which brands and model numbers will match this reach specification.  <strong>I would however suggest measuring your caliper reach to confirm my guestimate before any purchases.</strong></p>

"How to tell when disc brakes are worn?","13164","","<p>How do I tell how worn my disc brakes are and what are the consequences of letting them wear too low?</p>
","<p>It depends if your brakes have some kind of adjustment for the brake pads' position or not. An adjustment for ""the point in the lever’s throw where the brake actually engages"" (from Avid's description of their Contact-Point Adjustment system) can have similar effect. If they don't, they're worn out when you have to smash your brake levers all the way down to have any kind of breaking (but you could figure that out).</p>

<p>If you can adjust the pads' position, which is good because you can use your pads longer, then what you have to check is that the area showed in the picture (I couldn't find a word to describe it)</p>

<p>So how do you tell how worn they are? By comparing to their original thickness. The pads use up quite linearly (Observation, I have nothing to back this up)</p>

<p>The consequence of letting them wear too low is that if you brake without any ""breaking surface"" left on your pads, the metal bits could get stuck somewhere and ruin your disc.</p>

<p>Do not put oil or grease on the rims. If you have rim brakes, they may squeak after cleaning the rims. As long as it doesn't interfere with braking power, I don't worry about that. The clean-rim-squeal-sound goes away on its own after a bit. </p>

<p>In terms of the frame: With a steel frame, you'll need to worry about rust, particularly where you have any scratches in the paint. Patting the bike dry after a ride in the rain should deal with that. </p>

"What factors determine stem length ?","13092","","<p>Recently I went to a local bike shop to get a bike fitting advice. After taking body measurements, I was given a frame size recommendation. According to that, seat tube size, top tube size and stem length are 500mm, 520mm and 45mm respectively. Since the stem length of 45mm is unrealistic, I was suggested a bike that have 500mm top tube and 65mm stem length so that the total length remains the same. My question is </p>

<p>(1)What factors determine stem length ? </p>

<p>(2)Can shorter top tube compensate longer stem length without any harm ?</p>
","<p>Bicycle size is determined first by frame size, which is top tube length, seat tube length, and some more minor geometries like head tube and seat tube angle.  The primary determining factor for comfort on the bike is your reach measurement. </p>

<p>Although it is affected by various factors, like skeletal flexibility and the type of riding you do, ideal reach is generally considered to be the distance from your seating position, (where you actually rest on the saddle), to your hand position, (where your hands fall when placed in a neutral position on the bar), while your back and arms are relaxed and at roughly equal positions approximately 45 degrees each. Balance is what you are looking for here.</p>

<p>The stem length is a portion of the reach measurement.  That is, reach = saddle setback + top tube length + stem length + bar length. </p>

<p>Any of these factors can be altered to some degree to produce a correct reach measurement.  But there are other factors which affect this as well.  If your stem is too short, your steering will be too quick to react, as small movements of you body and hands will move your wheel too far, too fast.  This will make the bike difficult to control.  If you go the other way, with too long a stem, then your bike will handle sluggishly, and you might not be able to react quickly enough to an obstacle in the road. </p>

<p>Based on the measurements that you were given, I would expect that you are approximately 5 foot tall to 5 foot 2 inches.  I think that the shop is likely offering to adapt a bike in their stock to your size, rather than getting you the correct size.  If I am correct about your approximate height, you should be looking for a 47 or 48cm frame which will have between a 65 and 80mm stem on it.  If I am not correct, post your height and riding style, and we can give you more general advice on the correct size.  Best though is to find a shop which specializes in bike fitting, and get a second opinion. I am good at bike fit, but is difficult to accomplish well without having you in my studio.  </p>

"Best practices for commuting with rack & panniers","12989","","<p>I've been starting to commute by bike more (about 6 miles each way) and decided to upgrade from my cheap, old mountain bike to something more suitable. I just bought a used 2009 Kona Jake off Craigslist. Pretty excited about the bike -- it came with fenders, rear rack and two panniers.</p>

<p>Previously I've just carried everything in a messenger bag or backpack when riding. Panniers are new to me. What are some tips you have for packing and riding with panniers? I'll be carrying a laptop part of the time and beyond that a book or two, a lunch, maybe some clothes and other miscellaneous bits.</p>

<p>For example, I'm wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I don't have much on a given day, should I just use one pannier or try to distribute between two? In general, how important is it to keep them balanced?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I be concerned about heel spacing or getting on/off the bike? (In my initial short ride, it wasn't an issue)</p></li>
<li><p>When I have more weight, how much will it change the stopping distance and the bike's balance?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the bike's in to get a tune-up so I can't recall the make of the panniers. Beyond the rack hooks, there's also a strap that runs from the middle, has a hook on the end and some velcro that attaches to the top of the bag. I can't figure out what they're for.</p>

<p>** Edit **</p>

<p>Here's a photo of my new (used) panniers. They're <a href=""http://www.detours.us/panniers/d2r-small-pannier-set.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by D2R</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQuYH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>In general panniers are more comfortable and efficient than carrying weight on your body. There are some things to be aware of, however.</p>

<p><strong>Safety.</strong> Every time you set off, make absolutely sure that all the pannier straps are done up. Apart from things falling out, the last thing you want is a loose strap getting caught in the spokes. This can wreak a wheel, and a rider!</p>

<p>Regarding stopping distance, I don't think it makes much difference as the weight increases the friction between wheel and road. However, the extra weight does contribute something to heating the brake pads and rims/discs, but it's probably only an issue on long steep descents which are unusual on a commute.</p>

<p><strong>Panniers getting in your way.</strong> Yes, aim to keep your heel clear of the bags. This can be different when the bags are fully-laden as they tend to bulge further than expected. Worst-case you can pedal with your toes pointed down to avoid heel-strike, but this isn't comfortable for long. If you swing your leg over to get on and off then definitely take a bit of extra care to avoid pratfalls. Also be aware the rear of the bike is slightly wider.</p>

<p><strong>Left-right loading.</strong> Ideally it's nice to have them balanced, but unless there's more than 5kg difference between the sides, I'd say it's not really noticeable. So if all you're carrying is clothing and spare shoes, then it should be fine to take just one bag. However, if it's a stack of books consider two half-filled bags.</p>

<p><strong>Vibration and bumps.</strong> In my wife's experience, laptops seem to suffer from vibration in panniers more than rucksacks/messenger bags. Hers acquired a serious soundcard issue after being bounced in a pannier back down a slightly bumpy road. I'm not talking about crashing or dropping the bag, just riding the normal bumps in British roads. Your road surface may vary. Putting sensitive kit on your body is less comfortable for you, but more protective for the kit.</p>

<p><strong>Consider waterproofing.</strong> If the contents are sensitive to moisture (like the laptop), then you may want to double-bag unless you're really confident in the pannier's waterproofing.</p>

<p><strong>Tire pressure.</strong> Adding weight to your bike means you'll need a slightly increased tire pressure to prevent pinch-flats, particularly for the wheel over which the weight is situated. There's another question with some more information on <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2744/what-pressure-should-i-run-my-road-bike-tyres-at"">calculating the best tire pressure</a>, but ideally it should be done per-wheel and adding panniers to the rear will make this more important.</p>

<p>The strap that runs from the middle with the hook on the end may be to wrap around the lower part of the rack (and possibly back up to the pannier). The aim may be to stop the pannier from swinging out away from the bike or from jumping off when you go over a bump, but in my experience if the strap is made of elastic it doesn't prevent this. The best design to stop the panniers hopping off is a clip which fully-encloses the top horizontal bar of the rack, as is found on Ortlieb and many modern panniers. If you want more detailed advice, post some pictures when you get the panniers back.</p>

<p>Which if these will provide the best data? Are there other issues that distinguish them — such as accuracy or file size — that I should consider?</p>
","<p>TCX and FIT are designed for fitness activities, so they can contain more fitness data than GPX.</p>

<p>eg TCX or FIT supports laps (splits). So your device could record a new lap whenever you press the lap button, or automatically after a set distance, eg every 1km. Also they support pauses, if you want to stop the activity at one point, then start again later. Whereas GPX is essentially just a series of points (with timestamps).</p>

<p>I am not sure whether Strava actually uses the laps or pauses recorded on the device, I suspect it will recalculate them anyway, based on the GPS points and time.</p>

<p>As standard, GPX does not support heart rate, cadence or power data. But this can be added with extensions. The most popular format for these extension was created by Garmin, it is also supported by a variety of other software/websites (including Strava). But some devices might record heart rate/cadence in a different format in the GPX file.</p>

<p>TCX or FIT can also contain summary data, for the whole activity. eg the total time, distance, calories, device used, type of sport. Some of this is used by Strava, eg to display the device, or automatically select the activity type.</p>

<p>TCX and GPX are both XML formats, which can be fairly inefficient in terms of file size. But this does mean they can be easily edited, eg in a text editor. FIT is a binary format, so is much smaller file size, typically about 1/10 of the size. File size is usually not a problem anyway - even if you are recording at 1 point per second, a 3 hour activity would be about 1MB in GPX format. So not really an issue, unless your device has very limited memory, or a slow internet connection for uploading.</p>

<p>So in general, you probably won't notice much difference between formats for uploading to Strava. Though TCX or FIT may give you a bit more data. And FIT would be a smaller file size.</p>

<p>Inseam is specifically to determine what pants you wear.  I might point out that pants and bicycles are made and sized quite differently.  </p>

It won't cost you anything and you'll start to get a feel for how different styles of bikes feel in different sizes.</p>

<p>Note also that standover is not the only measure you need to size your bike.  The TOP TUBE length will also come into play--depending on how long your arms and torso are.  Different manufacturers build different bikes with different ratios of top-tube-to-stand-over.  </p>

<p>For example Bontrager makes a hybrid tire that is nice:

"SPD shoes that look like normal shoes","12893","","<p>We all know that SPD shoes can be worn off the bike (that is why they were designed), however there are not many SPD shoes that you would want to wear off-bike. There are even fewer (if any) SPD shoes that look presentable in a smart workplace.

<p>I am also interested in SPD shoes that you can and do wear to work and at work, particularly if they look completely different to the <em>'Shimano Golfing Shoe'(TM)</em> / <em>'Bling innit'</em> efforts foisted on the cycling public.</p>

<p>I know some people do not see any point whatsoever in a SPD shoe that you can wear all day or as part of a mixed transportation journey (e.g. cycle to the train station, catch the train and/or tube...) - it is different strokes/different folks.

"What is the effect of changing length of crank arms?","12820","","<p>There are some length options for the crank arms - like 170mm, 175mm.<br>
What is the difference for the rider? In which way does it effect the commute?  </p>

<p>Tried looking at <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/660/selecting-the-right-crank-length"">Selecting the right crank length</a>, didn't get a comprehensive answer.</p>
","<p>If you keep the rest of the bike the same a shorter crank gives more ground clearance at the bottom of the stroke, and that's going to be the main thing most people notice. You're unlikely to notice a change in power output unless you're shorter than, say, 1.7m, which would put you firmly on the down-slope of the power curve (ie, the part where longer = less power). You may notice a change in comfort or pain levels due to the increased joint articulation from the longer cranks. IMO most people would be better off switching from 170mm cranks to 160mm or 165mm cranks.</p>

<p>At the high performance end the power output varies in interesting ways. Since power = torque x speed, and torque = force x radius, a longer crank means more torque but also more leg movement to produce it. And vice versa for shorter cranks. In practice most athletes have a fairly flat relationship between average power and crank length in the range 150-170mm, but it's also something that is little studied.</p>

<p>A study by <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417428"">Martin (2001)</a> suggests that it doesn't really matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Power produced with the 145- and 170-mm cranks was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater than that produced with the 120- and 220-mm cranks. The optimal pedaling rate decreased significantly with increasing crank length, from 136 rpm for the 120-mm cranks to 110 rpm for the 220-mm cranks. ... The optimal crank length was 20% of leg length or 41% of tibia length. ... Even though maximum cycling power was significantly affected by crank length, use of the standard 170-mm length cranks should not substantially compromise maximum power in most adults.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found some <a href=""http://bicyclecranklength.blogspot.com.au/"">thought experiments</a> and <a href=""http://www.cyclinganalysis.com/annotated-bibliography-cycling-research/crank-arm-length"">this interesting summary/bibliography</a>. (edit to add) Ian Sims at GreenSpeed has long had an interest but I can't access their site right now, so here's an <a href=""http://www.atob.org.uk/technical/crank-length/"">A2B magazine post</a>. It's worth noting that Ian has changed his position completely, based on evidence that he mentions in that article. Previously he was a fan of long cranks, now he's suggesting that short ones work better.</p>

<p>Edit by mattnz replacing Mσᶎ's link: <a href=""http://www.powercranks.com/cld.html"">PowerCranks</a> have an interesting sales push with useful links and discussion.  They also provide test results showing advantages of short cranks. Apart from being benificial to people with poor flexibilty and knee problems, short cranks provide major racing benefit from improved aerodynamic position. They also discuss why its a myth you need long cranks for climbing. </p>

<p>(moz again) My experience is that shorter than conventional cranks work better than I expected and reduced my knee pain somewhat when riding hard (long tours or fast commuting for 40+ km/day). I'm 1.8m tall and ride 155mm cranks because those are the shortest I could get without paying a price premium. My partner is 1.5m tall and prefers 145mm cranks. Going up to the 165mm cranks on my load bike feels like a significant jump, but I haven't tested them because I don't have access to a power meter.</p>

"What are the effects of completely filling tires with water instead of air?","12814","","<p>As absurd as it sounds, I was curious as to how a bike would handle with the front tire filled with water.  I wonder if steep hill climbs would be easier (particularly for a mountain bike):</p>

<p>1) to bring the center weight forward</p>

<p>2) to use the increase rotational momentum to carry the speed through to the next pedal stroke.</p>
","<p>I happened to do just that.</p>

<p>I took an old hand pump and an inner tube to the bath tub.  Submerged the pump and pre-filled the tube with water, complete with burping out any air bubbles.  With the tube moderately full and free from air, I put it on the rim with the tire.  Then the final pressure up.</p>

<p>The first thing to notice is that the pump operates with lots of resistance (water flows a lot slower than air through those tiny parts).  </p>

<p>As I pushed each stroke of the pump, the resistance difficult yet constant.  I kind of expected the resistance to increase as I pressured up the tire, but it didn't.  It was a solid stopping point, halfway through the last stroke the tire wouldn't take any more water. (I shouldn't have been surprised, water is one of the least compressible substances around!)</p>

<p>Now out for a ride to test this out!</p>

<p>Indeed to carry the bike the front was a bit heavier (heavier is exactly what most cyclists would <strong>not</strong> want; but hey, lets see if there's some benefits).</p>

<p>Oddly, the bike didn't feel all that different.  Just slightly front heavy.  But once I got some speed the steering became really quite stable.  A ride through the forest and I could quickly pin point my leans for corners, it was soooo smooth!  Like the steering of a motorbike; I assume the extra rotational inertia in the front wheel added to the smoothing gyroscopic effect.</p>

<p>Mucking about, I tried a wheelie.  It took a bit of getting used to for lifting it up, but once up it was also very very smooth.  I was never that good an wheelies, but now I seemed to be able to ride for as long as I wanted.  Try balancing a baseball bat with the heavy side down, it's actually much easier with more weight at the top!  And the extra gyroscopic effect made it easier to steer the wheelie.</p>

<p>When stopped at a light or something, pick up the front tire and it would slowly start to rotate on it's own.  </p>

<p>It was fun, so I kept it.</p>

<p>The next phenomenon was a puncture.  sure enough, one day riding on a nice sunny day... I feel tiny sprinkles of water; I had a tiny tiny leak and I was actually spraying a very fine stream.  The tire hadn't lost much though, so I double timed it to my destination in hopes of avoiding changing in the field.  On arrival, the tire seemed really quite full still.  When off the bike the tire really wasn't getting flat. I left it.  I continued to ride for a week or so, sometimes the leak would come back... sometimes it would go away.  </p>

<p>I'm speculating, as I only did this once... but it occurred to me that with water being incompressible, the small amount of leaking water was very little volume but nearly all of the pressure.  The tire was still full and held it's shape, but no pressure to force the leak when I wasn't on it (it was obviously a very small leak). </p>

<p>Eventually I had to add some air, now and again (too lazy to put water in, and too curious to see how bad the water/air mix would be).  Soon the water/air mix was sloshing inside and causing a lot of resistance, and that became the end of my experiment.</p>

<p>In the end I did not see any improvement for hill climbs, or maintaining pedal momentum; only wheelies and cornering.</p>

"Should I change both tires when I need to change one?","12811","","<p>I know that it's a best practice in a car to change all 4 tires if you change 1, although in practice, it's only done if 3 need to be changed. Does the same thing hold true of a bike?</p>
","<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>In a car, the weight distribution is relatively even and you tend to get a relatively even wear, so that if 2 or 3 tires are obviously ready for replacement, you probably just can't tell that the others are ready. I suspect that also having 1 tire with a different amount of tread wear than the other tires on a car will lead to an unbalanced configuration that causes tires to wear out faster. (especially a left-right imbalance)</p>

<p>With a bicycle, the rear tire gets more weight on it than the front and will generally wear out more quickly.  By as much as 3:1. Because of this, and other reasons, some people will even use a totally different tire on front than on the back.  (could have the narrower tire on the front or on the back, depending on what you want to achieve)  <strong>On a bicycle, it's perfectly fine if one tire has worn down to being effectively smaller than the other.</strong>  You will never notice if the bike is ""leaning"" a millimeter or two forward or back.</p>

<p>The rear also tends to pick up more thorns/nails/screws/glass than the front, so there's also that reason the rear may need to be replaced sooner. The usual theory I've heard is that the front tire knocks the sharp things into a point up configuration in time for the rear tire to catch them, but I strongly suspect that it's more about weight distribution: the tire with more weight has a bigger contact patch and will push down harder on something it rolls over.</p>

<p>Overuse of the rear brake instead of learning to use the front brake properly can cause the rear to wear out even quicker.</p>

<p>You also don't want to rotate your tires between front and back.  That's something suggested with some cars, I think because you tend to wear the front <em>differently</em> than the back and can get a longer life that way.</p>

<p>However, if you're using the same type of tires on the front and the back, and it's the rear tire that's being replaced, you probably want to move the front to the back, and put the new tire on the front.</p>

<p><strong>You always want your best tire on the front.</strong>  A blowout in the rear is scary and inconvenient, but a blowout on the front is very likely to lead to a crash.  You also need the traction on the front for stopping much more than you need traction on the rear for acceleration. (and because your weight shifts forward as you stop, you just can't get very much traction on the rear for stopping)</p>

<p>I'm getting a squeaking sound, mainly from one shoe/pedal at the top of the power stroke. I'm almost certain it's from the shoe/pedal because just adjusting the angle of my foot a little (inside the play allowed by the cleat/pedal) makes the noise stop.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that the shoe and pedal are deforming/conforming to each other and have started to rub at the most common positioning.</p>

<p>I'd normally look at lubricating, but don't want to use grease as that will track through my house and office.</p>

<p>Any other thoughts?</p>
","<p>Rather than use grease, you can try using a 'dry' or wax based chain lube.</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply the lube to the flat clips on each pedal - hit both sides if they are double sided mtb pedals.</li>
<li>If you think the squeak may be coming from the pedal itself, rather than the friction between the pedal and the clip, apply some lube to the spindle attachment points where the pedal rotates around the shaft.</li>
<li>Wipe away any excess.</li>
<li>Hold onto a wall or go for a ride and and clip in and out of the bicycle pedals until the lube is adequately distributed and worked in.  </li>
<li>Repeat all steps if still squeaking.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you carefully wipe off the excess from your shoes/cleats and the pedals, you won't be tracking anything around your house after your ride.</p>

<p>If after a second application the squeak remains it may be a problem with the bearings in the pedals - some can be overhauled, but others it makes more sense just to replace.</p>

I know that it's recommended not to use biggest front chainring with big chainrings on cassette (and opposite) because parts will wear faster and I will loose a bit of pedaling efficiency, but I'm not sure, if I should avoid 2 or 3, or even more biggest (smallest in opposite case) chainrings on cassette.</p>
","<p>This is an old chestnut from the days of 5 speed freewheels and chainrings without shifting ramps. With modern hyperglide cogs and the relatively slinky thin modern chains, cross chaining is simply no longer an issue. While there are very few studies on this, the one I've seen suggests that there is no loss in mechanical efficiency for cross chaining at the angles typical of most bikes. </p>

<p>In general for a given gear ratio, big/big is more mechanically efficient than 
small/small. So the only science out there suggests that cross chaining on the big
chainwheel is actually more efficient. </p>

<p>I've never ridden another bike and never changed wheels before so will I notice a reasonable difference and do you think its worth swapping them for something like the Fulcrums?</p>

<p>Interested in peoples opinions pros/cons.</p>

<p>I weigh 80kgs ride a mixture of flat to very hilly terrain and approximately 80-100 miles / week</p>
","<p>I think probably swapping your wheels out is just about the single biggest improvement you can make to a bike in terms of performance.</p>

<p>I did this last year and love the new wheels. I too was riding Aksiums (I think) and bought some Fast Forwards. Qualitatively I am very impressed (but then I should be, if you boil everything down to money the FFwds cost 5x a set of Aksiums). Quantitatively, its difficult to say how noticeable the change is. I didn't see my average speeds jump or anything, at least not enough to notice. (I certainly notice being blown across the road sometimes (6cm rims), but that I'm not sure that counts!)</p>

<p>But now the caveat.....it all depends what you swap them for. I have no experience of Fulcrums so can't say how good that particular swap would be. Possibly someone else could help there. All I would note is that they're still toward the lower end of the price range (when you think you could spent thousands on wheels), so possibly they might not make as much difference as you'd hope. But as I say that's based on a hunch rather than direct knowledge.</p>

<p>One other point: not so long ago I had a spoke go on the Ffwds. Was a real pain in the ass to get a replacement (they were fancy bladed DT Swiss spokes and you're always recommended to change like for like). Nobody in the UK could sell me just a handful of spokes, only a box of them at about £100. In the end I found a place in the US who would sell them singly, just for a dollar or two, but it cost in terms of delivery and duty. I'm just saying, whatever wheelset you get it might be worth making sure you can source spares for it easily. </p>

<li>For Presta valves, unscrew locking nut at the

some air from the tube by pressing the air release 
tip on the valve to clean its inner parts.</li>
<li>Press the Clever Head on to the Presta or 
Schrader valve stem as far as it will go and open 
the thumb lever to the locked position.</li>
<li>The pressure gauge has a red arrow on the 
bezel that you can rotate to the desired pressure 
for easier reading.</li>
<li>Infate your tire by lifting the pump handle up 
and pressing down.  Do not over pressurize tire; 
see side wall of tire for maximum pressure value.</li>
<li>Use the pressure release valve to lower and 
adjust tire pressure.</li>

"Are runners or pedestrians allowed to use the bike lane?","12740","","<p>This morning on my commute I encountered a runner in the bike lane I was riding in.  This irked me because:</p>

<ol>
<li>The bike lane was on a busy street, with three lanes of motor vehicle traffic in each direction.  (I was northbound on Embarcadero in San Francisco, for those of you familiar with the city.)  To go around the runner I had to enter the car lanes, which makes me a little uneasy.</li>
<li>There is a <em>very</em> wide sidewalk available to runners and other pedestrians along this street.  There were no obstructions on the sidewalk, and it was not choked with other pedestrians.  In other words, there was plenty of room for this runner to run on the sidewalk.  (I'm guessing that he didn't want to run on the concrete sidewalk based on the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/nutrition/19best.html?_r=3&amp;ref=health"">misguided</a> belief that the asphalt roadway would be easier on his joints.)</li>
</ol>

<p>So when I was about to pass the runner, I called out, ""You're in my lane!""  His reaction was... not positive.  He started yelling and cursing at me.  I don't know exactly what he said; probably something about runners being entitled to use of the bike lane, too.</p>

<p>So my question is this:</p>

<p><strong>Do runners or other pedestrians have a legal right to use the bike lane</strong> (not that SFPD would ever enforce this even if it were a violation), especially when there is a sidewalk available?  If this varies with the jurisdiction -- and it probably does -- then I suppose I'm most curious about what the law says where I do all of my riding, in the San Francisco bay area.</p>

<p>(Irrelevant detail: I'm a runner myself -- I do a lot more running than cycling, in fact -- and I've run on this route many times.  I really have no sympathy for those who want to run in the bike lane, just because I feel like the sidewalk is perfectly adequate for runners when it's available.  I don't ride my bike on the sidewalk, after all.)</p>
","<p>Most US State and Local laws are based on the Uniform Vehicle Code and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines. They will normally have a phrase like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where sidewalks are provided, it shall be unlawful for any pedestrian to walk along and upon an adjacent roadway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a phrase like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where sidewalks are not provided, any pedestrian walking along and upon a highway shall, when practicable, walk only on the shoulder on the left side of the roadway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the short answer is ""no"", but may be different wherever you are.</p>

<p>The longer answer is that just like cyclist are allowed to take the lane when conditions warrant, pedestrians are allowed there when conditions warrant.</p>

<p>Ultimately we are all trying to share a limited amount of space. Courtesy from all parties is always appreciated, and usually returned.</p>

<p>Today I'm around 120 kgs and I was considering (among other things) starting cycling again. Is this bike ""good"" enough to carry me? What should I expect? Any tips?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT!</strong> Apparently, <em>Drag</em> have renamed some of their bikes in the last few years, so the above information is a bit wrong. <a href=""http://www.dragbicycles.com/?menu=product&amp;id=211"">This</a> seems to be my bike. At first I didn't recognize much difference, but this one has suspension on the front which mine also has. Does this change anything</p>
","<p>On a road surface you will be fine - try not to jump any kerbs ;-)</p>

<p>Compared to the force when a bike with even a light rider goes over say a pothole or a jump the static load from a 120Kg rider is small.</p>

<p>You might want to check the spoke tension reglarly - those are the parts that will suffer most.</p>

"Cant get my rear derailleur to reach all cogs","12680","","<p>I have been having an issue on my road bike getting the rear derailleur to reach all of my cogs.  I can either not reach my two smallest cogs or two largest cogs depending on the cable tension.</p>

<p>I found a nice set of instructions here: <a href=""http://www.williambenedict.com/bikes/derailleurs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.williambenedict.com/bikes/derailleurs.html</a> and followed through them with the cable disconnected and I was able to set the limit screws so that if I moved the derailleur manually I was able to shift smoothly to every cog.  Once I connected the cable I was able to shift to all but the 2 largest cogs so I started adjusting the barrel 1/4 turn at a time.  I had to turn the barrel almost all of the way in order to get to the 2nd largest cog(I can't even reach the largest) and with this adjustment I can no longer reach the two smallest cogs.  </p>

<p>From what I can tell my derailleur isn't bent at all.  Also, I'm not sure if it is much more difficult to shift to a larger cog than it is going back to a lower (I have bar end shifters).  I have to pull on it quite hard.</p>

<p>Since I am able to successfully shift to every gear smoothly whilst manually moving the derailleur, I imagine this is an issue with my cable.  Would it's age have anything to do with it?</p>
","<p>As you suggested, the cable may be at fault.  I change my gear cables once or twice a year to keep shifting smooth and free. If the cable/cable housing are old and worn they could be offering resistance.  If that resistance is too high the springs in the derailleur may not be strong enough to pull the cable through.  </p>

<p>Try removing the cable and housing, then make sure the derailleur and shifter are moving freely before fitting the new cable.</p>

<p>Then replace the cable and housing (these are cheap to buy online, but you do need a pair of housing cutters to cut the cable housing - think mine cost be about £15).</p>

"Does a 700c wheel help you go faster?","12625","","<p>Someone suggested going with a 700c wheel to go faster, and after thinking about it I am wondering if a larger wheel actually does go faster. I understand that your gears will cause a wheel to rotate once and if the wheel has a larger circumference it will travel farther, but this comes at a cost to leg power, and why not just get a larger sprocket? So cut out the gears and such and talk about the physics.</p>

<p>I was lead to believe that rotating weight is what slows you down, so a larger wheel will have more mass, thus making it harder to push, hence slowing you down. A bike with 12"" tires going the same speed as one with a 700c will have less rotating weight so will it be more efficient? If you are on a flat track with thin, hard tires and your bikes are geared to be equally efficient to pedal at low and high speeds, which wheel will make you faster?</p>
","<p>The increased weight of the larger wheel (if indeed it does increase) will of course add weight to the bike, but additional weight adds very little rolling resistance (though it does of course affect hill climbing).</p>

<p>It is a myth that ""rotating mass slows you down"".  In terms of top speed there's no difference between weight on the wheel rim and weight anywhere else on the bike.  Added weight on the wheel rim does reduce acceleration, but 10 grams on the wheel rim only has the acceleration-limiting effect of 20 grams elsewhere -- it's not really enough to notice.  (And once you've accelerated to speed this effect goes away.)</p>

<p>A larger wheel can ride over slight irregularities in the road with less energy expenditure, and so can be more efficient (and less tiring) in some circumstances.  And a larger wheel generally is more stable (though at the expense of maneuverability).</p>

"What is the actual cable pull of brake levers?","12540","","<p>I understand that there are 2 brake lever cable pull standards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Pull Levers</li>
<li>Long Pull Levers (for V-brakes and disc brakes)</li>
</ul>

<p>But what is the actual difference in pull? And specifically: what is the maximum travel caused by the lever on the cable (in mm or in inch)?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1f59.png"" alt=""brke lever pull diagram""></p>
","<p>A long pull lever (i.e. for V-brakes, mountain mechanical discs) pulls the cable about twice as long (but about half as hard) as a short pull lever (caliper, cantilever, road discs). </p>

<p>This is determined by the distance between where the <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/travel-agent"">cable ends and where the lever pivots</a>. According to <a href=""http://www.bikeforums.net/bicycle-mechanics/789752-long-vs-short-pull-brake-levers.html"">this thread</a>, its significantly lower for short pull than for long pull with some variation (it seems like under 30 mm is a cutoff for short pull to long pull if you're picking a lever out of the bin). Park Tool states that the distance from cable end to lever pivot is around 21 mm for short pull (around 42 for long pull lever), and with a 20 degree movement (think the cable end to lever pivot distance as a radius of a circle - with this radius, and the angle at which the lever bottoms out, you can calculate the total possible cable pulled), you pull about 7 mm of cable for short pull (versus 15 mm for a long pull lever). </p>

<p>Obviously, there is some flexibility in this parameter, allowing different manufacturers to design different cable pulls to get different sorts of lever feels. This can also be adjusted on the fly with systems like Avid's Single Digit line of brake levers. Someone <a href=""http://www.bikeforums.net/bicycle-mechanics/710495-brake-levers-adjustable-mechanical-advantage.html"">claims</a> the adjustment on the Avid Single Digit levers is enough to run short pull (YMMV). Usually when you buy a brake (or lever) from Shimano or SRAM, the manual specifies an ""optimal"" lever (or brake) to pair with.</p>

<p>If you run long pull lever with short pull brakes, it will be easy to pull the brake, but very hard to apply braking force with a hard lever feel. If you run short pull lever with long pull brakes, you will likely bottom out the lever before stopping (or lock up the wheel) with a soft lever feel. So, make sure to match the pull of the lever with the brake for your safety (obey the manual, except at your own risk!). </p>

<p>You can switch between the systems with a <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/travel-agent"">travel agent</a>. Some levers also have a switch which can work with both types with the flick of the switch (Shimano ST-EF65 shifters+brake levers, for example). </p>

"Should I get a performance bike or an endurance bike for 180 km rides?","12480","","<p>I want to do the 180 km of cycling in general, that is the 2nd leg of Ironman.<br>
I don't have a bicycle, as of now.<br>
I am planning to buy a road bike (not the one used for triathlon).<br>
People ask me to choose between a bike for endurance and a bike for performance.</p>

<p>I have ridden 200 km in a very cheap hybrid bike (twice the weight of an average road bike) in 11 hours.<br>
I would be using the bike mainly for triathlons and long distance brevet(but brevets at a later stage), so mainly concentrating in tri.</p>

<p>Now my question is:<br>
Doing 180 km in 6-7 hours come under race or endurance?<br>
The speed involved here is 30 km/hr.<br>
This will help me in choosing an endurance bike(Fuji, in my mind) or a performance bike (Trek, in my mind).</p>
","<p>The terms ""performance bike"" and ""endurance bike"" aren't very well defined. To many people, the term ""endurance bike"" describes touring bicycles, which are used for long-distance self-supported rides where you're carrying a lot of equipment and supplies. However, Fuji (which you referred to), uses the term ""endurance bike"" to mean a road bike with a more relaxed geometry and ""competition bike"" to mean a road bike with more aggressive geometry. Trek (the other manufacturer you referred to), seems to use ""sport bike"" to refer to the relaxed geometry bikes, and ""race performance bike"" to refer to the aggressive geometry bikes.</p>

<p>The ""endurance"" and ""competition"" bikes are both high-performance road bikes, it's just that the ""competition"" bikes sacrifice a bit more comfort to eke out the highest possible performance (in theory, anyway). Most bike manufacturers have multiple product lines that cover both categories, so the general category of geometry doesn't necessarily dictate a decision between manufacturers.</p>

<p>I suspect that for the length of ride you're considering, you'll feel more comfortable on an relaxed geometry bike (e.g., ""endurance"" at Fuji or ""sport"" at Trek). But in the end, it's all about how you feel on the bike, so you should really test ride a few different bikes and see what you like best. No list of specifications, however long and detailed, can remove the need to try a bike and find out for yourself whether it works for you.</p>

"Learning to ride fixed gear: Clipless or not?","12462","","<p>Which strategy is better for learning to ride fixed gear, if you're already comfortable with clipless pedals: </p>

<ol>
<li>Flat pedals at first, clipless after you're comfortable with being unable to coast.</li>
<li>Learning to ride clipless from the start, probably with the tension turned way down.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just got a fixed gear bike, which I plan to practice riding in a park for a while before using it as a commuter. I usually ride with clipless pedals, and I gather from questions on SE as well as other sources, that foot retention is quite important on a fixed gear as well. Thus, eventually, I would want to ride that way.</p>
","<p>Here's my experience:</p>

<p>The biggest problem in starting to ride fixed is that my brain would forget I was riding fixed, I'd come across a decent stretch of road (or a corner), and would attempt to coast. All totally subconsciously. </p>

<p>With flat pedals, provided I was doing a decent enough speed/cadence, I'd end up having to take my feet off the pedals until such time as I'd slowed the bike enough to get my feet back on and essentially regain control of the bike. Timeframe possibly 10 seconds during which the only real control I had was to steer and brake.</p>

<p>In clipless pedals, however, because my feet are attached to the pedals, as soon as my brain says ""coast"", my feet say ""whoaaaaa"". My brain then kicks back in and because I am still attached to the pedals I can just recover, easy as. And the timeframe here is just a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>So for my money, and assuming you do have a traffic-free environment in which to hone your skills, I'd go clipless straight away.</p>

<p>In traffic, I prefer flat pedals, just because I might want to put my foot down, like, <em>now</em>. But this of course is a preference thing rather than a technique thing.</p>

<p>btw, even though I've had a fixie for a couple of years now I still fall into this trap. Right now I'm probably only getting the fixie out once a month (compared to riding geared bikes several times per week), so there's an element of readjustment every time I take it out.</p>

","<p>Brake modulation how much fine control you have to apply a range of braking power distributed over the pull of your brake levers.  </p>

<p>No modulation is basically no braking vs wheel locking.  Having low modulation will mean it's hard to feather the brakes and you can only really lock up the pads.  Too much modulation means you will bottom out on the levers before you lock up on the wheels. Ideal modulation gives you access to the whole range of braking power desired and allows you to apply it evenly across the range of the brake lever, giving you fine control over feathering the brakes, stopping firmly, or locking the wheel.</p>

I was considering a switch to a drop bar setup for cyclocross racing so I have an alternative to my single speed cross bike. I'll be switching to STI shifters, so I have to replace my brakes since Shimano STI levers don't work well with the existing v-brakes. </p>

<p>I am considering a pair of TRP CX9, Tektro RX6, or Paul's Mini Moto.  These should be compatible with my STI levers. However, due to a lack of information about this, I need to know why I would prefer cantilever brakes to the mini-v option?  </p>

<p>Possible issues I was considering:
<li>Do mini v-brakes have to sit closer to the rim? Will this cause me to slow down more when my wheel goes through an inch or two of mud?
<li>Are the mini v-brakes going to be as effective at stopping? Will the modulation be poor, causing me to OTB more often when I try to stop suddenly?
<li>Is there a large difference in tire clearance between mini v-brakes and cantilever brakes?</p>

<p>If it matters, I tend to ride a lot in the northeast/mid-atlantic region of the US and it gets really muddy here, so I doubt most races will involve a dry pack course.  I also tend to get out on to real trails and ride on mountain bike singletrack from time to time.</p>
","<p>I switched to mini-v brakes, then to cantis. The mini-v brakes worked well, but I had a few issues. Here's what I found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do mini v-brakes have to sit closer to the rim? Will this cause me to
  slow down more when my wheel goes through an inch or two of mud?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the mini-v brakes pads sat closer to the rim in resting position, and since my rim was a bit out of true, they rubbed a lot. If I set them loose enough not to rub, I didn't have enough braking power. Switching to cantilevers set the pads further away from the rim and had no problem with rubbing on the brake pads. Mini-v brakes also did gather mud around the brake pads a bit more than the cantilevers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are the mini v-brakes going to be as effective at stopping? Will the
  modulation be poor, causing me to OTB more often when I try to stop
  suddenly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't notice a lot of difference in modulation between the mini-v brakes and cantilever brakes. I feel like the mini-v had a bit more power and could lock the rear wheel more easily, but I never felt that I couldn't feather the brakes in a similar fashion to my canti brakes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a large difference in tire clearance between mini v-brakes
  and cantilever brakes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there is much more clearance with cantilever brakes for both tires and mud.  I swapped in 700x41c tires and I had to remove the boot from the brake cable on the mini-v brakes because it would occasionally rub on the tire.  I have a lot more mud clearance using the cantilever brakes, probably at least an inch above the tire, where I had only a few millimeters using mini-v brakes. Regular v-brakes would probably have about the same mud clearance as the cantis, but don't work well with the cable pull from STI shifters.</p>

","<p>As you've surmised, optimizing a fixed gear for either uphill or downhill has its disadvantages.  If you're going to be riding a fixed gear on the street, you're likely best off starting with a medium gear. 70"" is pretty common, though you can go a bit higher if you're in a predominately flat region. For climbing, get used to bailing out from pedaling to walking when you lose your momentum. For descending, use a front brake to control your speed to a point where your cadence is still smooth and not throwing you all over the road.  With experience and training you'll be able to climb steeper and further before you walk and descend faster without having to lean on the brake as much.  If you want to work on those skills separately, consider a freewheel singlespeed bike, where you can dial in a lower climbing gear and still coast while descending.</p>

"Can I run a 10 speed cassette on an 11 speed wheel, but also keep running 10 speed on a 10 speed wheel?","12205","","<p>I bought a second hand cyclocross bike (running Shimano 105) and I ... love it. I've been doing some short commuting on it as well, but the nobbled tires are copping a pounding. </p>

<p>I've got a spare set of 11 speed wheels kicking around home that came with my road bike that I upgraded. My question is, I want to put some wide road tires on the 11 speed wheels and keep the CX tires on the 10 speed wheels and just swap the wheels in and out depending on what I feel like doing. </p>

<p>Obviously I'd prefer not to have to tune the gears every time that I swap the wheels. </p>

","<p>Use spacers on the 11 speed wheel to put a 10 speed cassette on. </p>

<p>See your hub manufacturer's page for details, but its normally a 1.8(5) mm spacer (which comes with the hub, but you can buy separately) and a 1mm spacer (sometimes; which you'll get with the cassette).

"Replace crankset or cassette for better road performance on an MTB?","12182","","<p>I few years ago I got into cycling again to help keep fit. I still had my mountain bike from when I did some easy trail riding. </p>

<p>I'm mainly riding on the road now and I was wondering if I can change the crankset or cassette might give me a little more speed. A couple of months into the warm weather and I top out the gears even on a slight downgrade.</p>

<p>There's one very hilly ride I do and the toughest hill I'll sometimes go as low as the second or third lowest gear in the beginning of the season until I get used to riding again. I only ride when it's warm out. If anyone's in the NYC/NJ area it's the hill by the Englewood Cliffs boat basin in PIP.</p>

<p>I have an old <a href=""http://www.bikepedia.com/quickbike/BikeSpecs.aspx?Year=1998&amp;Brand=Gary%20Fisher&amp;Model=Gitche%20Gumee&amp;Type=bike#.UrpbUd-ldqN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Fisher Gitche Gumme</a> (specs in link I think the same year) which has:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shimano Altus, 24/34/42 teeth crankset </li>
<li>7-speed, 11 - 28 teeth cassette. (Actually cassette might be 8 spd 11-30)  </li>
<li>Shimano Altus top-swing, top-pull front derailleur </li>
<li>Shimano BB-CT91E, 116mm spindle bottom bracket</li>
</ul>

<p>In a year or so I might get a road bike but hoping I can get a little more life out of this one. I saw the Shimano FC-M131 48/38/28T 175mm which I like because I'd prefer longer cranks and also the FC-M311 48/38/28% 170mm which both seem like reasonable upgrades to make to a bike this old.</p>

<p>I have no idea if these will fit the bottom bracket I currently have (which seems fine) or if I'll need a new one. Or would I be better off changing the cassette?</p>

<p>I'm not looking to win any races or set any mileage records just don't want to keep hitting the top gear and not having any resistance while pedaling.</p>

<p>I don't know enough bike parts to know if the 2 cranksets I mentioned are easy to swap on my bike or not and would appreciate input from someone who knows more or recommendations on other cranksets that would fit better. The 2 currently are going for 30USD and I don't want to put more than 50-60 into this old bike.</p>

<h2><strong>Update:</strong></h2>

<p>I haven't changed anything on the bike. I have been working on my cadence and that seemed to be the best approach. With my increased cadence I'm rarely topping out the gears on level roads. Keeping the tires at the upper range of pressure helped too.</p>
","<p>Since you already have an 11 tooth smallest cog you're not going to be able to swap that for a smaller on. Well, you can get a 10T cassette but I don't recommend it, they're designed for small wheel bikes where the faster wear on that cog is just part of the deal.</p>

<p><strong>Swapping to a road triple crankset</strong> should be do-able, and with any luck your front derailleur will work with the new one. A cheapish 30-39-50 is about $60 on ebay or amazon, so probably a bit over $US100 fitted if you go to a bike shop. But since you'll need extra chain to wrap around the bigger chainrings, best budget for a new chain and rear cassette (normally those get replaced together. See <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5043/if-i-replace-chainset-and-chain-should-i-replace-back-cassette-as-well/5045#5045"">here</a> and <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/14625/new-chain-causing-skipping-on-cassette-will-this-work-itself-out-or-is-it-unsa/14626#14626"">here</a> for why) which will probably be another $100 or so. Call it $250, but ask for a quote because this is a pretty standard swap. </p>

<p>If you're unlucky you might need a different length bottom bracket ($50-ish), or a new front derailleur (plus gear cable, $100-ish). Those are things the bike shop probably won't know until they start fitting parts to your bike, so the only way you'll get a certain quote up front is if they decide to replace them regardless.</p>

<p>That will give you noticeably higher gears across the board, but obviously you lose the low gears (you'll effectively lose your smallest chainring and gain a much bigger one at the other end.</p>

<p><strong>Or fit a slightly larger MTB triple</strong>. That will give you less gain in range but is more likely to work with your current derailleur and bottom bracket. You can easily get 28/38/48 sets, and the difference in the top gear between 48T and 50T is small. But that's the problem - you're going from 44 to 48 or 50T, and while either will be noticeable, it's not as much as you might think.</p>

<p>The difference is in how easy it is to go even bigger. On a road triple getting a 52/54T chainring is easy, but with an MTB crankset those chainrings get pricey if you can find them at all. We have a local manufacturer who CNC cuts chainrings, so we can get anything we like. I expect people like that are on the web as well, but you'd have to look (and try to buy local since you're fairly likely to want to swap them when they don't work on your bike because they're too big).</p>

<p><strong>A completely different approach</strong> would be to fit fat slick tyres. Or even fat knobbly ones. If you're riding for fitness, the extra drag (and very slightly higher gearing) will be just what you want. Schwalbe make their ""fat frank"" tyres as big as your bike will take, or ""Big Apple"" out to 2.5"". The big tyres will be noticeably harder to push along at the same speed. And remember, as the cops here keep telling us ""the faster you go, the bigger the mess"". Going fast just because you can, rather than because you have somewhere to go, doesn't make a lot of sense. I commute ~20km each way on a nice comfortable upright commuter bike that will go 30kph if I push. So I get fitter faster for the same distance ridden. And when I'm lazy I pull out my drop bar racer and do the same ride in 3/4 of the time (33% faster average speed). But I'm more likely to crash on that bike, and if I do it'll hurt more.</p>

"What are the positions on drop bars called?","12181","","<p>I've heard the different places to put your hands on drop bars given different names, like ""hoods"" which I think is the flat part on top or maybe the brake levers, or ""drops"", referring to the lowest part of the bars.

","<h1>""Middle of the bar"", ""On the tops"", ""Middle"", ""Top"", ""Tops"", ""Center""</h1>

<p>Hands on the part of the bar closest to the stem. The middle has some width and you can slide your hands around there.</p>

<p>Hands at the outside end of the section where the bar turns. You can grip the corner different ways. There's a sort of position in between corner and hood (""ramp""?), too.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lYQ5S.jpg"" alt=""Corner""></p>

<p>Hands on the brake hoods. The brake hood is that rubbery thing that the brake lever comes out of and on a modern road bike likely also contains the shifter. There's different ways to put your hands on the hoods, I'm showing two I use.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONQRS.jpg"" alt=""Hood 2""></p>

<h1>""On the drops"", ""In the drops"", ""Drops""</h1>

<p>In the lower curved part of the bar. With the drops you can be leaned way down with your hands far forward/up in the hoods, you can be about where I'm showing in the picture, or you can be on the lowest part of the bar (where you can't reach the brake lever).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eA9cI.jpg"" alt=""In the Drops""></p>

<h1>Note for all of these:</h1>

<p>There are various different hand positions in each of those main positions, but not necessarily names for them. Some of the differences can be subtle and don't really look much different, but change the pressure points on your hands.</p>

<p>Most road-bike riders primarily use the hoods, and that's generally what's currently encouraged. It's the most comfortable position that you can brake and shift from and gives you good leverage. The drops are your fastest position and also give you good leverage. Middle is most comfortable for your hands, but gives you the least control. </p>

","<p>I would also go the commercial route, buying the hitch and building only the trailer itself. The handling (during cycling) of an axle attached trailer is <em>much</em> better than if you attach it on the seat post. Handling is best if the hitch parts can move as little as possible relative to each other. The Chariot hitch is pretty good, especially considering the fact that only one axle/quick release module fits a wide range of dropout designs.</p>

<li>can easily be locked (although the lock won't scare a good lock picker)</li>
<li>an integrated bike stand is available</li>

"700 wheels on bike made for 27"" wheels","12153","","<p>I just bought an older road bike with 27"" wheels.  I am curious if I can mount 700 wheels (typical road size) on it.  Has anyone ever done this?</p>

<p>The main reason I am interested in doing this is so that I can have more tire selection.  I like the body positioning on my road bike but since I live in a rural area I do a fair bit of biking on gravel/dirt roads and pathways.</p>
","<p>Yes, this has been done and is very often done for the exact reason you mentioned: far greater tire selection.</p>

<p>In a general sense, the important considerations you must make stem from the difference between a 700c wheel and a 27"" wheel. If we look at a more precise measurement than the common nomenclature, the bead seat diameter, the difference is more obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li>700c wheel: 622mm BSD</li>
<li>27"" wheel: 630mm BSD</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that the former is 8mm shorter in diameter than the latter, and when you mount a 700c wheel to a bicycle with brakes set for a 27"" wheel, they will be mis-aligned by 4mm (a significant amount).</p>

<p>Depending on what type and variety brakes you have, you may or may not be able to reposition the brake pads correctly. In the case that you can't, you will be able to replace them with brakes designed to have a longer 'reach'.</p>

"How to measure the correct belt drive tension?","12116","","<p>I own a 2010 Trek District with a belt drive. I'm fairly happy with the setup, since after months of standing outside I just picked up the bike again and started riding without the usual chain maintenance. </p>

<p>However, the problem I currently have is that under large torque, so e.g. accelerating out of traffic lights makes the belt either slip or jump off the rear cog. Riding in traffic with cars close-by makes this a somewhat dangerous mishap, so I'm hoping I could fix this. Even when pedaling with high cadence the belt seems to be moving outwards all the time, and can be fixed by pedaling backwards one round or so. </p>

<p>The instruction manual and <strike><a href=""http://trekdistrict.com/2008/10/belt-tensioning/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">googled resources</a></strike> [broken link - try this <a href=""http://www.trekdistrict.com/index.php?topic=537.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trekdistrict discussion</a> or this <a href=""http://www.bike-manual.com/brands/trek/om/hybrid/belt_ov.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bike-manual link</a>) claim that setting the correct tension and alignment to be easy, but I've found it to be quite a hard task. So, could someone with more bike mechanics skills and experience tell me how to do this or point me to a good resource? </p>

<p>The main questions are:</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to set the tension, without having a special tool for measuring the tension? </p>

<p>How accurate does the tension have to be in order not to slip under pressure?</p>

<p>How can I (easily) align the belt correctly for it not to travel right on the rear cog?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answers! I could probably take it to the local shop, but I've been trying to handle all and any maintenance myself, since this is a hobby after all.</p>

<p>==== Edit ====</p>

<p>I don't have a picture of my own, but the rear dropouts look like the ones on this picture:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YA2ZQ.jpg"" alt=""Trek District Dropout""></p>

<p>I've tried to adjust the tension and managed to get rid of the slippage, so the original problem is more or less solved. I've also tried and managed to tighten the belt too much, since it started to have a funny noise and the freewheel didn't seem to work correctly anymore. Now the tension seems about correct, but the belt still ""travels right"" (as in the image) and jumps off the cog, when accelerating. </p>

<p>I'm starting to think that the rear hub is not perfectly straight with regards to the belt, but I would think one would notice this when riding. </p>

<p>=== Edit 2 (2011-08-10) ===</p>

<p>After nearly getting hit by a bus, caused by the belt jumping off the rear cog, I decided to bite the bullet and take the bike back to the shop. Turns out I have strong fingers, since the problem was too much tension on the belt. The high tension made the rear wheel not fit perfectly in the rear dropouts. This made the wheel just the slightest bit misaligned (what's the opposite of straight?), which in combination with the tension made the belt to travel outwards when applying enough torque. </p>

<p>I got the thing fixed, and it now works as a charm. I'm unable to tell the difference between the earlier too tight belt from the correctly tensioned one, since the difference is very subtle. Thus, the moral of the story has to be that one should use the correct tools for the task at hand. And also that my mechanics skills are not quite as good as I was hoping :)</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions here, but from now on I suggest all the belt-drive people like me either get the real tools, or support the local bike dealer for the no or low maintenance of the belt drive. </p>
","<p>As to measuring belt tension, the tool is your best option. If you own the bike, then you should own the tool. </p>

<p>Without it, however, place an S-bent spoke or similar wire in a hook over the center of the top of the belt. Add weight to the bottom hook. 10 pounds is the spec. Yes, this is a lot of weight for a bent spoke. Be creative. Or buy the tool.</p>

<p>Place a ruler next to the belt, at the point of the weight's pull. Write down the measurement.</p>

<p>Remove the weight. Measure again, in the same place. Subtract the first measurement from the second measurement. The difference should be between 5 and 12 millimeters. 10 millimeters is ideal.</p>

<p>The alignment is dependent on the type of dropout. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1: The image below is a new tool from Gates, called the Eco Tension Tester, which does exactly as described above, in a more professional manner. Perhaps it will help describe the intent of the method I described.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CtYZj.png"" alt=""NEW Gates Eco Tension Tester""></p>

<p>With the dropout style you posted in your image, the alignment is actually set with two things. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wheel centering - the wheel needs to be equally centered between the chainstays. This is a do it by eye and feel job, although you can gauge your success by measuring from the rim's brake surface to the inside surface of your chainstay, assuming your wheel is properly dished over your hub.</p></li>
<li><p>The second thing which affects the belt alignment on the pulley is your ""chain"" line. With the District, this alignment is set with the length of the bottom bracket spindle. The more perfect the chainline, the less likely you will have issues with the belt rolling off the cogs. Most bike shops have a tool like the Park Tool CLG-2 for measuring chainline accurately, although it is designed to work with a toothed cog.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8wHe.jpg"" alt=""Park CLG2""></p>

<p>If you have consistent issues with the belt rolling off the cog, and your dropouts are evenly set up in the frame, and your wheel is centered, find an LBS to check your chainline.</p>

<p>You may need to swap the bottom bracket axle to get more perfect chainline, in order to solve this issue. Assuming the bike has not had the BB replaced by you, it may be wise to ask the shop where it was purchased whether it is the original BB, and whether they will help with any chain line issues under warranty status.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2: It actually appears that belt ""alignment"" issues are directly related to belt tension with the Gates Carbon Drive belts. If the tension is correct, they track well. If it is too low, they will track toward the frame. Too high tracks away from the frame.</strong></p>

<p>I hope that is helpful.</p>

<p>For example, I would like to make a frame mounted front rack (rather than handlebar and/or fork mounted rack).  I know for sure the welds will be uglier than a professionally brazed job, but are there other issues to be aware of?</p>
","<p>The reason that brazing is traditionally used on steel bikes is so that the temper of the chromoly tubes won't be wrecked.  (The high temperatures associated with conventional welding would seriously damage the tubing.)</p>

<p>However, Cannondale, in their push to develop good aluminum bikes, invented the technique of rapid welding (since aluminum can't be brazed, and traditional welding worked poorly).  This technique was transferred to the manufacturer of steel bikes, which is why most modern steel bikes are welded (without lugs) rather than lugged and brazed.</p>

"What causes the noise that race wheels make when you are not pedaling?","11866","","<p>A friend just got a new tri bike with Zipp wheels and they are loud when she is coasting.  What causes that?  </p>
","<p>There is a part on the hub of the wheel called the Freehub. This is a ratchet mechanism which allows your bike to freewheel, or move forward, even when you are not pedaling. This is different from Fixed gear bikes, which have no freewheel mechanism, and will force your pedals around, as long as the wheels are moving. </p>

<p>The noise you are hearing is the pawls, which are spring loaded teeth. These teeth allow the hub to move forward when you stop pedaling, by moving out of the way. But thy will spring back up and grab the inside of the freehub shell when force is applied from the chain. Meaning when you start pedaling.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOTlO.jpg"" alt=""Diagram of Bicycle Freewheel""></p>

<p>This photo is of an old style freewheel, but it illustrates the concept well.</p>

<p>The noise is caused by the spring action of the pawl clicking back into place. Because your friend is riding Zipps, which are large hollow constructs of carbon fiber, that noise is amplified particularly loudly. The rims act kind of like speaker boxes, and the noise sounds loud. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look, who has the longest unbroken history of carbon fiber frame making in pro road racing, uses the tapered fork steerer design to eliminate the narrow waist at the junction of the fork crown and steerer. This allows their all-carbon HSC6 fork to be laid up as one unit and in a manner that keeps the unidirectional carbon filaments that support the structure flowing from the fork legs, through the crown and up the steerer tube in a smooth, unwrinkled matrix. The more uniformly that the fibers are aligned where the crown flows into the steerer tube, the stronger the fork will be in its most highly stressed area. </p>
  
  <p>Look’s engineers also developed a tapered lower bearing interface that eliminates the stress concentration that a conventional notched-type crown race would cause. The bottom line for tapered road steerers is that, done correctly, it streamlines the manufacturing process and makes for a better one-piece carbon fiber fork.</p>

"Why is a proper road bike pedal preferred for road bikes?","11744","","<p>I've been riding road bikes for a couple of years, but with mountain bike pedals, I've been thinking about switching over to a road bike pedal, but what's the reason? Is the performance improved or is it more about conform?</p>
","<p>Hmm, we're kind of hitting most of the answer but not all of it (in my opinion that is!).</p>

<p>Its probably better to ask this the other way round - why not use a road pedal on a mountain bike...</p>

<p>On a road bike you're generally going to keep your foot in the pedal, you're only going to take it out to stop so therefore you want it to be as simple and as light as possible.</p>

<p>On a MTB you're liable to have your foot on and off more often, you're also likely to want to be able to stomp your foot onto a MTB pedal and have it stay there so it needs to have a larger platform area. You could also make an argument about MTB shoes being softer but the designs tend to be driven by competition and so that's probably more coincidence than anything else. If we're talking about using toeclips then clearly you'll need bigger pedals and clips for MTB boots than road shoes.</p>

<p>And weight <em>does</em> matter - it may only be a few 10s of grams but a few here and a few there will add up and all other things being equal less weight will make a difference.</p>

<p>I use clipless pedals - which I recommend - and I have one pair of shoes that I use on all my bikes, some of the pedals are fairly minimal for road, some clearly MTB, some hybrid but more MTB than not and <em>all</em> work with the same SPD cleat. Paradoxically my current setup has double sided pedals on the ""road"" bike and single sided on the MTB type pedals on my shopping bike...</p>

<p>So why road pedals? Assuming clipless and further assuming that you will only wear cycling shoes then you don't need the ""complexity"" (no difference in my pedals) or the weight of a full platform - so why have it? But the real difference will be in the shoes you chose to use.</p>

<p>(As I final thought I actually have two pairs of shoes - one waterproof - and a pair of sandals and they all have the same cleat so that I can use whichever is appropriate to the weather on whichever bike I happen to be out on.)</p>

<p>1- What happens if I simply do that without removing the rust or removing the old painting? Wouldn't the new painting simply cover everything?

So what is the effect of not following those steps and directly use the black matter spray? Because the youtube steps would cost me 24 euros or so.</p>

<p><a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/paint-prep.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> is a good resource for repainting the bike. </p>

<p>If you don't sand and rough up the old surface, the paint will likely not stick (a  primer helps the paint stick as well). </p>

<p>Spraying the crankset is a bad idea - you may get paint in the bottom bracket, or on the chainrings. If you want to spray the arms or something, take it apart and then spray parts that don't touch the drivetrain on their own (in fact, you'll need to strip the bike to spraypaint it properly, or at least guard out the entire drivetrain). </p>

<p>That being said, its not that bad of a color, and as a student, a roughed up bike is less of a target. </p>

<p>If you're not going to spend money or the effort to strip it down, I'd say roughing up the surface with a bit of sand paper and brushing on some paint (probably 2 euros more on the whole) would be a better option), but in any case, the bike will look uglier than it does now!</p>

"Badly rusted suspension fork","11671","","<p>I have a $300 MTB used for <strong>commuting</strong>. It has been <strong>three</strong> years now, and the rain and snow have said their word. Two weeks ago I disassembled the fork and spent a good one hour with the sandpaper, removing rust. Still some was left. It has been two rainshowers from then. Yesterday I had another look and ... it is not promising. </p>

<p>I have move aggressive means of removing material (so that there will remain no rust) - a grinding wheel. However, I am afraid to use it, as I guess it will be weakening the tubes too much. I do not seek top performance - it is a no-steal bike (for example the handlebar is visibly bent).</p>

<p>Below are the two pictures. <strong><em>Should I clean the rust? How? How reliable is the fork currently? How long does it have left?</em></strong></p>

","<p>In addition to the visible rust on the stanchion tube (that's what those are called), the rust has most likely damaged the gaskets sealing off the lower tubes - the portion of the fork that the stanchion tubes slide into. Even if you got the rust off and got the stanchion tubes in a good-as-new condition (which is probably impossible) you'd still have to replace the innards of the fork. It's probably more economical to just replace the whole thing. If you insist on trying, a buffing wheel and buffing compound will get you closer than a grinding wheel. But personally, I'd just replace it with a rigid fork, especially since you ride in the rain and snow. </p>

"How do you count the number of links in a chain?","11647","","<p>I thought this was a simple question but apparently there is some confusion - and it's good to have a basic question to refer people to. </p>

<p><strong>How many ""links"" are in these short bits of chain:</strong></p>

<p>Image A (the original image for this question):</p>

<hr>

<p>Image B:</p>

<p>Some people thought the bit of chain was too short and was missing a set of rollers, or wasn't in a loop. Here's a longer length of chain -- exactly twice as long as Image A, in fact. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gj9FE.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gj9FE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In your responses, try to make it clear whether you're referring to Image A or Image B.</p>
","<p>Each set of ""inner plates"" is a link. Each set of ""outer plates"" is a ""link."" </p>

<p>In the photo below  you can see two whole links.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AeiNo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AeiNo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Thus to answer the question, Image A in the question above has 4 links. Image B has 8 links.  </p>

<p>When you buy this box of chain that is labeled as having ""120 links"" and is standard 1/2"" pitch, you should expect to get 60 inner links, 60 outer links, for a total of 120 links and it should measure 60"" long:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWZY2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWZY2.jpg"" alt=""Sram PC1071 - 120 Links""></a></p>

<p>Another way of thinking about links is that a ""link"" as a ""place where a tooth goes"" - thus if a chain wrapped completely around a 44 tooth chainring - it would have 44 links --  with 22 outer-plate-links and 22 inner-plate-links.</p>

<p><hr>
Another way to analogize is with a standard chain:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hk9IW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hk9IW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Everyone would agree that the standard chain image above has six links - each link creating one ""hole"".</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>Please note that there is a small but vocal group of people (including Sheldon Brown) who count a <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""complete link"" as ""one inner and one outer half-link""</a>. Counting ""complete"" links has the effect of halving the number of links (thus Image A would have 2 complete links, Image B would have 4 complete links, and that five foot length of SRAM chain would have 60 complete links).</sub><br>
<sub>Counting ""complete"" and ""half"" links as Sheldon does is non-standard at least as far as the industry is concerned. If someone starts talking about ""complete"" and ""half"" links when talking about chain length, you should clarify with them what they are talking about as you may end up with half or double the number of links you might otherwise expect.</sub></p>

<p>What are the differences between steel and aluminum wheels?  Why are aluminum wheels more desirable?</p>
","<p>Steel has been the standard for cheap bikes for a very long time.  Weight is a prime factor, as noted above.  In addition, steel rusts.... If you go to someplace where lots of bikes are parked outside for any length of time, like the university where I work, you can pick out the cheap bikes instantly by the nasty rust that starts forming with great speed.</p>

","<p>The 10 speed crankset has smaller spacing between the rings due to the smaller chain to fit the rear cassette. A nine speed crank set will work with a 10 speed drive train.</p>

<p>However it's not all plain sailing. You can have trouble using a 10 speed FD with a 9 speed crank set. It doesn't shift as far out as the 9 speed so you may experience sloppy changes to the outer ring and chain rub against the FD in some gears. Some people I've heard of run a 9 speed shifter, FD and crank set up on the front and 10 on the back to avoid this but most are happy not to.</p>

"Tube constantly getting punctured near the valve","11570","","<p>I have been using my bike for a few years now, and for the last month i am constantly getting this problem. After riding a day or two, it looks like my tube gets rotated a little inside the tire, and the valve becomes bent. If i continue riding, the tube gets torn. So i have to remove the tire, wiggle the tube a bit, and it's back to normal for a few days.</p>

<p>The tube seems to fit very well, and i don't notice any inconvenience when inserting it, so maybe my problem is not caused by bad tubes (or maybe it is? how can i make sure?)</p>

<p>Another thing that might be relevant: i started riding moderately technical terrain in the last year (going down rocky roads, riding downstairs in the city). The problems started just a month ago; maybe the additional stress, combined with the warm weather (25-30°C now), is the cause?</p>

","<p>I would bet this is caused by a tire with rubber that got ""old"". This tends to happen to MTB tires that are repeatedly ridden on mud, and I had some tires with this behaviour before.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be insuficcient friction between the rubber and the rim around the bead, specially on those tires with a material resembling fabric on that region (like it seems to be your case, judging by the first photo), and are worse on the front tire since it applies traction only while braking - the rotational force is always applied in the same direction.</p>

<p>One measure to take, as already mentioned, is to put a higher pressure on the tire. It might allow you to get home without damaging a spare tube, but it's not the ideal solution since the slipping tendency is still there anyway, and sooner or later the tire ends up slipping, most probably when you don't expect.</p>

<p>One other measure, that actually works very fine, is to ""reactivate"" the rubber on the groove where the rim and the tire ""seat"" against each other, considering that:</p>

<ul>
<li>In tires with old rubber, many times the said surface is ""shiny"", or ""glassy"", or ""vitrified"", or ""mirror-like"";</li>
<li>In tires with fabric in the bead, the rubber ""disappears"" with use, and the slippy underlying fabric is left to make contact with the rim.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both conditions contribute for the slipping due to reduced friction coefficient. So, to REACTIVATE the grippiness of the material, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take the tire from the bike and wash it with plenty of water until it is completely wet. Since the tire is off, you can wash the rim either;</li>
<li>Brush the bead groove vigorously with a properly-sized brush, applying some abrasive soap mixed with water. Mechanics soap could be great but maybe too violent. I had excelent results with toothpaste (seriously!), and even with glycerin soap without abrasives. In any case, adding water enough to get a good foam is much better than just rubbing the dry product on the rubber. Rinse repeatedly after this with pure water, aiding with the brush;</li>
<li>Optionally, at last you can apply those products to make car tires ""shiny"". These tend to somehow protect the rubber from getting dry and glassy again.</li>
<li>Important: assemble and inflate the tire while it is still wet.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had tires almost unusable because of this slipping problem, and the problem disappeared like magic after performing these steps.</p>

<p>As an additional fact, any modifications I tried to make in the rim (cleaning, sanding, filing, grooving) had no effect.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"Burping v/s bleeding hydraulic disc brakes: is it safe?","11564","","<p>I found a method for <em>burping</em> (get the air out of the circuit) hydraulic disc brakes in YouTube (see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nypZiLC1_Z8"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). The method is: </p>

<p>1) Rotate/move the hand lever assembly until the reservoir cap is facing up and at level. </p>

<p>2) Take off the reservoir cap. </p>

<p>3) Slowly squeeze the lever repeatedly, until no more air bubbles come off.</p>

<p>4) Refill the reservoir with brake fluid.</p>

<p>5) Put the cap back on and return the lever assembly to his normal position.</p>

<p>To me it looks far more simpler than the standard procedure, and can be used in an emergency on the road (Obviously, it doesn't apply for replacing old fluid).</p>

<p>What problems can you see with this method? </p>
","<ul>
<li>You aren't assured of getting all the air out of the system.  If your bubbles are further down and this doesn't remove them, you may actually introduce more air than you remove when you replace the cap.</li>
<li>You won't effect a fluid change this way.</li>
<li>You won't replace the crush bolts and other pieces swapped at the true bleed that are        potential sources of failure.</li>
<li>If something happens and you bump/spill some fluid, you are SOL for replacing it.</li>
<li>If you have a leak that has introduced air, this may not help any. </li>
</ul>

<p>Not to say this isn't a decent method to try for a home mechanic as an initial troubleshooting step if you are into it.  It may be done faster, with little to no cost, and may help some issues.  However, you are correct, it does have several shortcomings.</p>

"Why should I choose 36 or 32 spokes (or another number)?","11559","","<p>I have to change the rims of my bike and I have to choose between 32 or 36 (or 48 or any other variation). I never thought about this until now and I feel it's kind of a dumb question, but I don't have a clue if this has any perceptible impact or not.</p>

<p>So far, I understand that more spokes means a stronger wheel, but also more spokes means a little bit more weight. Despite that, a spoke weights almost nothing so I think that's not a practical difference to take into account.</p>

<p>Is there anything else? I ride a single speed bike mainly for city commuting, so is there any practical difference between choosing 32/36 spokes (or another number)?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot people!</p>
","<p>Lower spoke numbers are primarily of interest to weight weenies (though for a given price, a lower spoke wheel will probably use a heavier rim offsetting the spoke reduction weight savings). </p>

<p>As usual, <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html"">Sheldon</a> is some good reading. There is also a whole book on how to build wheels well and design decisions, by Jobst Brandt, called ""The Bicycle Wheel"".</p>

<p>What matters for most people is using a good amount of spokes, good spokes, a good rim and hub, and putting them together well (and how they're put together) - pretty much any wheel is going to be bad if the wheelbuilder messes up/sucks. </p>

<p>Heavier riders often should go with a higher spoke number than a lower spoke number and tougher rims+spokes. According to Sheldon, it used to be that you'd run 36 front, 36 back then we started dropping. On a commuter, I'd emphasize durability, so I'd probably go with the more spoke option.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is talk to a good wheel builder and assess your individual needs. If you got to the point where rim wear was what made you replace the rim, chances are you're fine with whatever you had. If you're replacing the rim, make sure to use new spokes and make sure the hub is in good condition.</p>

"How long will a battery last in a Garmin GSC 10?","11555","","<p>My relatively new Garmin GSC 10 Speed/Cadence unit has started losing connection to my Garmin 500. I'm assuming that the battery is running out, since I'm still using the original that came with it. I have done about 35 hours of riding. </p>

<p>So I am wondering: how long should a CR 2032 battery last? </p>

<p>I know this is a little subjective and will depend on ambient temperature and to a lesser extent speed and cadence for transiently illuminating the LED each pedal stroke/wheel revolution. But generally, how many hours can I expect to get from a battery?</p>

If this occurs battery life is shortened due to an internal short which causes the battery to drain more quickly than normal. </li>

So say I want to shift to a higher gear, it will try to drop me back down to my lower gear. My guess is I might need to lube up the cable and shifter. Any other known solutions?</p>
","<p>With friction shifters this is usually caused by one of two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loose Shifter Screw:</strong> Friction shift levers usually have a wing-nut-screew used to adjust the tension and friction of the lever against the mounting housing.  Tighten this screw, but not too tight or else you can't move the shift lever.  You can also take the shifter apart (noting carefully the order of the parts) and clean everything with degreaser.  DO NOT LUBE - you are trying to regain friction, not remove it.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit re. ʍǝɥʇɐɯ  - After you adjust everything you may find that the shifter screw continues to come loose almost immediately - in that case you may want to use a little 'adjustable/removable' Loctite on the screw, assemble, and let it sit for a while before using.  That should help hold everything together.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cable Friction:</strong> Often there will be one or more points of friction on the cable route.  This could be in the housing, or in the routing channels under the bottom bracket.  As you apply pressure to the pedals the frame flexes, pulling the cable one way, but then the friction stops it from sliding back.  Check and clean your housings and routing points, especially at the bottom bracket.</li>

<p>My current chain is 2 months old (about 800km) and is over .75 already so I think I'll replace it this weekend. Mind you, it is winter here and it's been pretty wet most weeks. Also there is a lot of fine sandy grit on the paths I tend to ride.</p>

Why am I burning through chains so fast?</p>

There are some hills so I am reasonably often out of the saddle and pushing pretty hard. I will take the old chain into a bike shop next weekend and let you know what they say.</p>
","<p>A new chain has factory installed lube inside on the bushings and pins. It is a thicker, stickier lube than anything you can put back on the chain after a cleaning which is that thorough. </p>

<p>I love that you take time to maintain the bike. Definitely check your chain checker, as Daniel said, but on your next chain, try relaxing the maintenance a bit. </p>

<p>Clean the chain by spraying a light citrus degreaser on a rag, folding the rag in the palm of your hand, and running the chain through the rag. This will clean the exterior and the accessible bits without soaking away the internal factory lube. </p>

<p>Once clean, lube the exterior of your chain with a quality lube (I like Boeshield T-9 or Dumonde Tech yellow) and wait 15-20 minutes. Then wipe off all excess lube. </p>

<p>your fork is Coil Spring / Hydraulic Open Bath with Air Pressure preload adjuster.</p>

<p>The table present at the page 3 of the mentioned manual refers specifically to Travel-Adjustment-equipped suspensions, which doesn't seem to be your case. Anyway, the pressure recommended for the Air Preload system, in this table, ranges from 15 PSI to 43 PSI (27 psi for your weight, as I understood from your question).</p>

<p>The table at page 6 of the manual refers to adjusting the SAG (how much the fork sinks under rider's weight while in normal riding position) via air pressure, suggesting an initial value of 15 PSI, but implying that rider's preference should determine the ideal setting.</p>

<p>These forks which mix open bath, coil spring and air-pressure preload adjustment on the same side of the fork (I have a similar one, a 2004 Marzocchi Drop-Off- II, which I run with 0 PSI otherwise it is too stiff for my taste) tend to need relatively small pressures, since the pressure is only a fine-tuning. That is different from a air-only-spring, where you need a much higher pressure since it is air alone that conteracts rider's weight and bumps.</p>

<p>At last, it is interesting to know the ideal pressure RANGE (10 PSI is much different than 110...), but once this is determine, trial and error and experimentation is the definitive way to know what's the ideal pressure for you.</p>

<li>I maintain a steady pace, enough to get sweaty, but this is more from the length of the ride than from the intensity. I stay dry for the first part of the ride.</li>
<li>I feel strong and capable most days. Rarely I will feel worn out on the last kilometer or two, but this is pretty rare and I guess indicative of bad sleep.</li>
<li>The ride is 100% flat. The biggest climbs are speed bumps.</li>
</ul>
","<p>As far as I can tell, no. I've been riding 30 minutes or more every workday before breakfast for more than 10 years with no detectable ill effects. When I was riding an hour to work I'd sometimes have a small snack before riding, but only rarely. When I'm cycle touring I'll often ride for an hour before I have breakfast, as that wakes me up and gets me warm, then I can stop and eat somewhere pleasant (I usually stealth camp so I'm not always sleeping in a nice place to hang round during the day). But an hour isn't an unreasonable ride before breakfast. For me!</p>

<p><strong>What matters is being aware of your body</strong>. If you're feeling bad, stop and work out why. If you're hungover... what did you expect? But if you normally feel fine and one day your stomach hurts, or you feel weak, or something else changes, worry. Stop, work out what the problem is. Eat, drink, pee, whatever. It's the same as if your bike feels funny or starts making a weird noise.</p>

<p>Normally I carry breakfast to work, so I have it with me if I need to stop and eat. I also have money, which is surprisingly useful for solving problems :) If I need to I can get a taxi to work, buy food, whatever.</p>

<p>FWIW I was vegetarian for most of that time, of late I've gone back to eating meat every couple of weeks (I'm getting older and meat seems to help me maintain muscle mass). I don't know if being vegetarian helps, but it doesn't seem to hinder the ride before breakfast.</p>

"Is there a difference in having tires filled with CO₂ vs air?","11382","","<p>When you fill your tire with a CO₂ cartridge you are obviously putting CO₂ into it.

","<p>This is a debate that gets picked up on every bicycle forum known to man (okay, that might have been exaggerating a bit). Typically you start to ask the question when you notice that the morning after you have used your CO2 cartridge, your tyre is ridiculously low. </p>

<p>By no means am I a chemist but, as it has been explained to me, CO2 and butyl are more soluble than N2/O2 and butyl. Most tubes are constructed from butyl (fancy pants cyclists will sometimes use Latex tubes, haha).

"How to get more tire clearance with caliper brakes?","11328","","<p>I've discovered the brakes on my Bike Friday Tikit don't allow for enough clearance to run Schwalbe Marathon tires. The bike - a folding bike with 16"" rims - ships with <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/4383682952/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kojak treadless tires</a>. It looks like, as long as I have the existing caliper brakes - Tektro R530 brakes - I won't be able to run anything more robust than the Kojaks. </p>

<p><em>Brake removed from the bike:</em><br>

<p>There isn't any way to mount these brakes differently, and the frame only has braze-ons for these brakes. A smaller tire or a smaller brake are really my only options, short of mounting the rims farther out - a bit of a kludgey solution, I think. </p>

<p>While I'm open to simply finding a smaller tire, I would much prefer to run Marthon tires as I'd like to use this bike for some light touring. </p>

<p>My question is: Are there caliper brakes with more tire clearance I could mount on this bike? What should I look for in these brakes? Will new brakes require me to change my brake levers? (I'm using Tektro RX 4.1 reverse levers.)</p>
","<p>This is an interesting question, well suited to this site! The problem is a common one for touring cyclists wanting a 25-32mm tyre and mudguard, where the solution is to 'get a bike with cantilever bosses'. You have a compound problem of short reach, a measurement you could do with measuring.</p>

<p>The dual-pivot brake doesn't offer a lot of tyre clearance, but do you need dual pivot anyway? Campagnolo groupsets have the dual pivot on the front but single pivot on the back, here is the affodable-style Veloce option:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXzPN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A high-end Campagnolo brake may just about work for you and be a classy addition to the bike, giving vastly improved stopping power over the Tektro efforts, but you still might struggle to get a big tyre on there.</p>

<p>You can mitigate against that by using a slightly thinner 16 * 1.35"" Marathon Plus tyre - this will give you more puncture protection than the 16 * 1.75 Marathon and would be my preferred option. Note that the 16 * 1.35 Marathon will have a lower profile than the 16 * 1.35 Marathon Plus, so more room can be gained at the expense of puncture protection.</p>

<p>Also worth investigating are late 1980's era Weinmann and Dia-Compe side-pulls of the short-reach flavour. These will not have the stopping power of today's side-pulls, however, how much stopping power do you need to lock up the rear wheel? A bit of flex won't be the end of the world on the back brake, and these early brakes can be had for a good price. The shape of the arms on these brakes did allow for a reasonably fat tyre, the only real problem is getting the recessed allen key rather than bolt attachment. That said, the main bolt on the Weinmann brakes can be interchanged as they were available to suit recessed, Allen key fitting. Here are some Weinmann 500's, from centuries ago,but with compelling tyre clearance:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R4gOP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>These were available in black. Another beauty is the 605. This one does not have the hex-bolt exposed to aid centering, but I don't think you can beat the combination of short reach and tyre clearance:</p>

However, its frame size may be slightly different than the ""ideal"" size for me. If this difference in size will make the bike uncomfortable on extended rides, I'd rather purchase a different one that fits well, even for more money.</p>

<p>Based upon my height and leg length, I ought to be using a 55cm bike frame.</p>

<p>How much smaller/larger of a frame can I use before it will be uncomfortable? +/- 5cm? More? Less?</p>
","<p>First, note that frame sizes aren't standard - you may ride a 55cm in one model, but a 52cm in another model (say, comparing road racers to cross bikes). And, you do pick your model based on preference - I prefer a larger bike than most people of my height, since I have relatively long legs and long arms. </p>

<p>Most of the time, you can go about 1 frame size above or below the ideal frame size (thats around +/- 2 cm in model numbers, typically ) with part tweaking - the most important measure being top tube length, which can be drastically different between similarly labeled models (This can be offset with saddle and stem replacements to some extent, but the adjustment ability is relatively limited). <strong><em>This is why getting good bike fit is important (and why people have to try bikes before buying them) - the geometry chart isn't super useful unless you know how that chart fits you (and some relevant swappable parts like saddles come into play as well).</em></strong> Of course, you have to be careful with this, especially for bikes which will be used off road (you wouldn't want to hit the wedding jewels on the top tube for example). </p>

<p>This is a good <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/frame-sizing.html"">article</a> on the topic of frame sizing. </p>

<p>For what its worth, if I had to intuitively place a 55cm, 60cm, and 50 cm road bike, for males, I'd guess a 50cm being for people closer to 5'2"" ish, 55cm for people closer to 5'6"", and 60 cm for people who are probably 6'1"" ish. But again, this is completely useless without trying the bike.</p>

<p>To add, most likely, a wrong frame size (or misadjusted frame) will lead to back pain or knee pain. Both are not fun to deal with once you're past being a teenager.</p>

"Upgrading wheels on a vintage Peugeot Frame","11302","","<p>OK so I have a Peugeot Galibier bike that consists of a Reynolds 301 steel frame.</p>

<p>A while back the original derailer gave up the ghost while riding, bending the rear-wheel spokes in the process. I was told it wasn't worth re-truing the rear wheel so I bought a cheapo Raleigh wheel from the LBS. I also bought a new 7-speed freewheel and Shimano derailer which I managed to install myself (using the original chain) and has been working great for about a year now.</p>

<p>The bike is nice to ride but I wouldn't mind upgrading the wheelset to a lighter and better set that would help with climbs and longer tours. I have in mind the Mavic Aksium.</p>

<p>I know this wheelset, along with many others use the modern dropout spacing of 130mm. I am pretty sure my bike is has 126mm spacing. Being a steel frame I am fairly confident i can just squeeze a 130mm wheel in there but my concern is the cassette size and chain.</p>

<p>I am under the impression that an 8-speed cassette uses a narrower chain. Would this work with my original crankset and friction shifters?
i would rather stick with a 7-speed. Is it possible to find a semi-decent road 7-speed shimano cassette to fit on a Mavic Aksium and still use the slightly wider chain?</p>

<p>Any advice greatly appreciated....</p>

<li>Wheels are definitely 700c - I know this having previously replaced the rear wheel and buying new tyres &amp; tubes.</li>
<li>I would like to move away from the <strong>freewheel</strong> system to a <strong>freehub/cassette</strong> system. The idea is that I want to put a semi-decent set of road wheels on it. Mavic Aksium seems a good choice. This has a dropout spacing of 130mm. My bike has 126mm.</li>
<li>I would like to avoid cold-setting (bending) my rear dropout if I can. Sheldon says it should be possible but there may be a few issues.</li>
<li>Derailleur is modern so should hopefully take whatever chain is used.</li>
<li>Friction shifters mean no worries about indexing.</li>
<li>I would like to stick to a 7-speed cassette. Reasons: I doubt my shifters can do more than 7 (bike was originally a 6-speed); I assume this will help maintain chain compatibility between front chainrings and cassette. Am I wrong?

</ul>

<p>At the moment it seems like it should be OK. Maybe I should just bite the bullet and buy the wheelset and work to get it to fit....! Might help to borrow a friend's modern 700c 130mm hub wheel to see if that fits first though.</p>
","<p>You're on the right track! My answer will be long, but I have a lot to say, so here we go!</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, lets deal with your dropout spacing - there are two solutions I have used on my old steel road bikes. The first is to buy a 126mm freewheel hub which can be built up with sleek rims and will take a high quality 6 or 7 speed freewheel. The two manufacturers that come to mind are <a href=""http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/components/wheelsets-rims-hubs/hubs/grand-cru-high-flange-freewheel-hub-126mm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Velo Orange</a> and <a href=""http://paulcomp.com/jonohub.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Paul Components</a> - both are very high quality, but the VO hub costs $75 and the Paul hub costs $184. They both use sealed bearings and are both very nice to look at (with their high flanges and windows.) The benefits of using a 126mm hub is you avoid having to respace your frame, but the drawback is that you're wedded to freewheels which, if you change out gear clusters frequently, can be troublesome. </li>
</ul>

<p>(Random note: try to not lose or break the rear quick release for a 126mm hub. It is a HUGE pain to find another one on short notice as most QRs have threading for a 130mm hub, minimum. Plus, the threads are rolled, not cut, so you can't just run a die over a skewer and make it shorter!)</p>

<p>The second option is to swage out your stays to accept 130mm or 135mm rear hubs. There is an excellent thread <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10837/can-a-relative-beginner-adjust-spacing-on-a-501-cromo-road-frame"">here</a> which will give you more info. I successfully respaced my 90s' Bridgestone from 126mm to 135mm so that I can run mountain hubs with cassettes. You could just try to squeeze a 130mm hub into your frame, but in my experience it is hard to close your QR enough to force the dropouts comfortably flush against the hubs locknuts (and this isn't a good thing for wheel bearings, especially cartridge bearings! It would be more of an issue as the dropouts get splayed wider. More and more bikes are now made with dropout spacing at 132.5mm so that you can go up to 135mm or down to 130mm easily.) </p>

<ul>
<li>Being an older steel bike, it may use 27"" wheels. 27"" wheels have a BSD of 630mm, while 700c wheels have a BSD of 622mm. You will want to upgrade to 700c wheels because tire and rim availability makes it practically necessary (i.e. there aren't many mfgs of 27"" rims/tires anymore!) The difference isn't important in terms of frame size and clearance, though you may run into problems with your brakes if they don't reach far enough to contact the smaller 700c rims. Brake reach is measured from the brake bolt hole diagonally down to the center of the rim braking surface. On cheap brakes with no vertical pad adjustment the pads would just eat into the tire's sidewall. Either long-reach brakes or a <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/home-drop.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drop-bolt</a> will solve this problem. (If you do replace your calipers, make sure you get nutted brakes or learn how to adapt a frame to accept recessed mounting bolts.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Your bike has <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/calipers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">caliper</a> brakes, but I want to add a bit of info regarding bikes with cantilevers as I've had to slog through this mess several times before. Since canti studs are brazed to a frame with a rim diameter in mind, switching from 27"" to 700c rims will pull the braking surface down by 4mm which, when using brakes with limited adjustability, means you have to swap in some with lots of vertical and horizontal pad movement. Since canti stud placement has only recently been standardized, this makes upgrading old touring frames a crapshoot as brake availability is limited. One measure I took on a troublesome 1981 Miyata 1000 was to run caliper brakes and leave the canti studs alone altogether. (Another issue with upgrading wheels on an older canti-brake bike is the distance between the front posts. See <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5619/dia-compe-brakes-for-1991-bridgestone-rb-t"">this</a> thread for more info.) ((A more final approach would be to braze on a new set of cantilever studs, but this is hardly a novice project.))</p>

<ul>
<li>Finally, in choosing drivetrain parts that will be consistent and compatible, I don't think you'll have an issue. Friction shifters are compatible with (mostly) everything (good choice.) As far as chain width goes, with a new Shimano-compatible hub you'll be able to fit an 8 or 9 speed cassette - a 7 speed cassette will likely need a spacer to fit properly. </li>
</ul>

<p>Your rear derailleur will have to be reasonably modern, but I haven't had any issues with running 9 speeds under an 8 speed derailleur. In general, it is easier to use 9 speed hardware on 7 or 8 speed cassettes than to use 7 speed hardware on 9 speed cassettes. Ideally, chain width should correspond with your rear cassette (ideally.) The only concern would be if the crankset and chainrings were designed to run 5 or 6 speeds originally. If the distance between the chainrings is too great the chain can slip between them, but I've never seen it happen, even on franken-bikes with mismatched drivetrains. <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/speeds.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is a great Sheldon Brown article about gearing.</p>

<p>Where do you keep your water to optimize speed/agility/enjoyment? </p>

<p>Edit: It seems to me that road bikers never use camelbacks.  Is there a reason for this?  </p>
","<p>Best?  Doesn't seem like there's any one right answer.</p>

<p>Pros for carrying on bike:</p>

<ul>
<li>Weight is on the bike, not you</li>
<li>Doesn't make your back all sweaty</li>
<li>No adjustments necessary</li>
<li>Generally easier to clean</li>
<li>Easier to choose alternate beverage options (with the right bottle)</li>
<li>Easier to just always have a water bottle on the bike (one less thing to worry about remembering to bring)</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros for carrying in a hydration pack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to drink from (so you drink more often in little sips)</li>
<li>Can drink without waiting for smooth riding (don't necessarily need to remove a hand from the handlebars)</li>
<li>Less likely to pick up dirt (cleaner; but see comment about flip-top for bottles)</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like the kind of cycling you're doing makes a big difference.  Mountain biking has more dirt and more rough terrain where your water bottle nozzle could pick up trail dirt and be hard to reach down and grab to drink from.  Road biking tends to have plenty of smooth pavement allowing for drinking from a bottle and not as much dirt to worry about.</p>

<p>I mostly ride on the road and generally use a water bottle (or two or three; or a water bottle and a coffee travel mug), but if I'm going for a long ride (especially in hot weather), I'll use the hydration pack (and probably have a bottle in all 3 cages, maybe with juice or something like that in one) just to be sure I keep well-hydrated.</p>

The only part, that was exchanged is the chain  - one month ago. The bike is a commuter/touring/cross-country style ridden. The hubs of the wheels do not have holes for bolts, that should hold a disc.</p>

<p>What are the main things to consider when upgrading to a rear disc brake? What parts should I buy? I am considering brake + whole assembled rear wheel == hub+spokes+rim. </p>
","<p>First, it's an expensive upgrade that won't benefit you much. You'll see quite a few cheaper bikes that only have a disk on the front, because that's where you get most benefit from a disk. So the cheaper option is definitely to buy a better V brake. It will work just as well and be cheaper.</p>

<p>You will need a new rear hub, and it's likely to be cheaper to buy a prebuilt wheel rather than pay someone to rebuild your current rim with a new hub into a wheel (I suggest not re-using the spokes even if you can). You will, of course, need to buy the disk brake as well.</p>

<p>Since it's the rear brake, I'd go with the cheapest cable operated brake I could find. The advantage there is that it's cheap. A more expensive cable operated brake will work slightly better and have both pads adjustable making it easier to set up. But it won't look any more like a disk brake, so there's no real benefit in your situation. Likewise, a hydraulic brake will work better in the rain and snow, but cost more.</p>

I hadn't gone far so went home and took the car to work instead.  When I got home later, I was surprised to find the tyre, while still soft, hadn't lost all pressure by any means.  It was around 40psi and felt the same as when I left it in the morning.</p>

<p>I decided there must be a slow leak somewhere, but I couldn't find one anywhere, putting the inner under water and going around it methodically looking for bubbles.  I've never failed to find a leak before that way.</p>

<p>I've switched it out anyway because I don't want to mess around with my commute, but I'm curious ... is there another explanation for that amount of pressure loss?  Or must there have been a puncture somewhere that I missed somehow?</p>

<p>The tyres (whole bike) are pretty new and in excellent condition.</p>
","<p>Could be a faulty valve that only leaks under high pressure.  You won't be able to find this kind of thing by putting it under water because there's no way you'll get the tube up to 100 psi while it isn't on the rim with the tire on.  It could also be due to very very small holes in the tube, again which don't make any difference until the tire is at very high pressure.  You may be able to test this if you fill the tire up to full pressure and then leave it in the bath tub or other large sink.  you should be able to see if air is escaping from the valve this way. Not sure if you would be able to see air escaping from very small holes in the tube though as they might not be visible due to the tire/rim.</p>

"Rack (& Pannier) for a bike with disc brakes","11220","","<p>I'd like to get a rack for my bike (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=Haibike+Land+Herren"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Haibike Land</a>). The problem is that the bottom screws are blocked by the disc brake:</p>

<p><em>(If it is not obvious from the photo, the brake and its mounting screws are in the way of the rack.)</em></p>

<p>Are there any solutions for this problem? In my LBS they just told me that bikes with disc brakes are not meant to have racks (although they've told me this after telling me it should fit fine and ordering it). But I'm sure I'm not the only one with this issue.</p>

<p>I've thought I could put some washer or spacer there but I'm a bit worried about the torque caused by such solution.</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>To clear things up, here is the side photo (from bottom in the direction of the saddle):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jcbFX.jpg"" alt=""Side view""></p>
","<p>I think the LBS is partially correct, that bikes with disc brakes aren't generally designed to hold a rack.  That said, I think there's a few solutions (other than getting a bike built to have disc brakes and a rack):</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a seat-post (or similar) mounted rack.  Downsides: very low weight limit, often not good at holding panniers, and probably prone to spinning around.</li>
<li>Use ""p-clamps"" instead of the built-in holes.  These are rubber-covered clamps that would go around the seat stays to give you a hole for a rack up above the problematic disc brake stuff. This is more usually done on bikes that simply don't have a place to bolt anything on. Downsides: may put the rack too far up, may put the rack too far forward, may slide, may not be as strong.</li>
<li>Spacers and a longer bolt with a somewhat wide rack. So that the rack's stays run to the outside of the brake hardware.  It seems to me that too much weight would tend to try to bend the bolts down and the holes up.  Would be much better if you could find a rack that could use both holes.</li>
<li>I don't know the right term, but it might be possible to find a metal piece that screws into both of those holes and gives you a new hole behind that location.  I've seen some racks mounted like that to get the rack back further for more heel clearance.</li>
<li>There are racks made to go on bikes with disc brakes.  The one I found first ( <a href=""http://www.topeak.com/products/Racks/ExplorerTubularRack_discMount"">http://www.topeak.com/products/Racks/ExplorerTubularRack_discMount</a> ) basically has the spacer I suggest in #3 built in.  The second one I found ( <a href=""http://www.tubus.com/en/rear-carriers/disco"">http://www.tubus.com/en/rear-carriers/disco</a> ) basically comes into the holes from behind instead of directly above, like I suggest in #4.</li>
</ol>

<p>A rack specifically designed to mount on a bike with disc brakes would be best, of course.  The other options might be cheaper.</p>

"Fixie vs Road Bike - the right fixie bike for bunch rides","11179","","<p>At our local bunch rides, we're seeing more and more guys out on fixies and they are going at a phenomenal pace. We have a local segment called the ""Chicken Run"" (and it's <a href=""https://www.strava.com/segments/848832"" rel=""nofollow"">flat</a>) and this one guy in an orange fixie went over 55km/h!</p>

<p>We've spent thousands on our own bikes (carbon, alloy, etc) to have a guy on a simple, light weight fixie / single speed bike beat us like that!?</p>

<p>So my question is - what fixie set up have you got that gives you the ""edge in the bunch""? Any specifications to aim for?</p>

<p>At this rate, I am going to have to sell all my bikes for THE ONE fixie.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Yes I know the ""engine"" (ie: legs) is what counts, but I am after specific gear ratios that could (note I said <strong>could</strong>) allow you, with reasonable fitness (I am 173cm and in my mid 40s and consider myself fit to very fit) to be able to clock over 50k/hr on the above short 500m segment (my personal record is 43secs and I want to aim for under 40secs).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Incidentally, the KOM for that segment has been flagged as it was done by slip-streaming a motorised vehicle.</p>
","<p>For context, I have been doing group rides for about 20 years now, raced at the cat 1/2 level for a good portion of that, and had a fixed gear obsession off and on for many years too. Riding fixed is an interesting challenge, but it is most certainly not an out and out advantage.  The short of it is that your 55 kph fellow is likely a strong rider, who also knows how to time an impressive effort.  The combination of the factors is leaving all of you scratching your heads and doubting yourself... club ride mission accomplished!</p>

<h2>When fixed gear be an advantage</h2>

<p>In the right circumstances fixed gear bikes can be extremely efficient.  You have a straight chain line, no pulley wheels and a lighter overall bike.  Plus, your momentum helps push the pedals through the dead spot, making it easier to spin fast.  If your gearing is right for the stretch you are riding then you may actually be at an advantage.  For example, if you have a flat time trial with consistent wind and the right top end gearing, once you are up to speed, you will be hard pressed to find faster set up (other than a full aero TT setup).</p>

<p><strong>That said, fixed gear are only optimal in a limited set of situations... the rest of the time it's a suffer fest.</strong></p>

<h2>When fixed can be a giant disadvantage</h2>

<p>While there are times you can fly on a fixed gear, depending on your environment and terrain it can also be a massive disadvantage.  55 km is a fast pace, which suggests he is pushing some big gear-inches.  If you had any big climbs on your ride, or strong head winds, this gearing would likely be a massive suffer fest. </p>

<p>One of our club rides has attacks starting on a stretch with sustained 17 degree gradient. On a fixed gear with a tall gearing pretty much any rider would get tossed out the back due to the mechanical disadvantage.  </p>

<p>We can also have some nasty sustained head winds.  Again a fixed gear with tall gearing would be a suffer fest.  </p>

<p>If you lowered the gearing to accommodate these features, you likely would be able to hit your 55 kph ""chicken run"" speed.</p>

<h2>How to make yourself look stronger when at a disadvantage</h2>

<p>One part of group riding is figuring out ways to turn the screws on your fellow riders.  This is often a combination of psychological warfare and physical strength.</p>

<p>One of the best skills to learn is knowing your limits, your advantages, your disadvantages, and developing a good sense of timing. If I find myself at a disadvantage (i.e., slower bike, less fitness), I will focus on pacing, never doing more than the absolute minimum (conserve, conserve, conserve).  I will likely plan for only one large effort, but in that effort I will put all my cards on the table (absolutely everything).  Leave nothing behind (similar to the swimming scene in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/"" rel=""nofollow"">Gattaca</a>.  Even if that means getting spit out the back shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>All you need is one massive effort for everyone to remember and be intimidated.  No one thinks that is all you have, they often assume you could do it again and again (which is often not the case).</p>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

<p>Next ride, watch him for the whole ride.  Does he hold back on other aspects of the ride (like taking shorter pulls), allowing oneself to slip from the front to the back during climbs.  Is your club ride fairly sedate before the ""chicken run?""  All of these scenarios may allow him to  metering and conserve his effort in preparation for laying down a beating on your ""chicken run."" </p>

<p><strong>If that is the case, it's not the bike that is the advantage its the combination rider and strategy and execution.</strong>  </p>

<p>If you want to flip the situation, you need to play to your advantages and his disadvantages. Because you have gears, you can ride at an optimal gearing in more situations.  You need to make use of this advantage.  You can do this by attacking him whenever his fixed gear appears to be putting him at a disadvantage. If it looks like the his gearing is too tall on a climb, hammer the hell out of the climb.  If you have a head wind, gutter the peloton so that he can't draft.  The more you do this the more his fixed gear will become a liability, and the less reserves he will have left for the fabled ""Chicken Run.""</p>

"Choosing a foldable 20"" bike: Schwinn S2280 vs. Citizen Bike Miami","11151","","<p>At the moment, I'm in the market for a foldable 20"" bike, for <strong>commuting</strong> purposes. I've done my research, and have found two appealing models:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=schwinn%20foldable%2020%22&amp;qscrl=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=8048516064691228319&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0pjlTdSSH4S8sAPzk4ntBg&amp;ved=0CFwQ8wIwAg"" rel=""nofollow"">Schwinn S2280</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.citizenbike.com/catalog.asp?product_category_id=1&amp;product_id=1"" rel=""nofollow"">Citizen Bike MIAMI</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Which of them would you recommend? <strong>How are they different?</strong> Any differences in terms of weight, ease-of-use, ease-of-tuning, stability, accessories, size, portability, durability, joy-of-use/misery-of-use (it's for my dad)? </p>
","<p>I think the real difference is the weight: Schwinn 47 lbs, Citizen 32 lbs. That's substantial. If your dad is going to be carrying it much that 10 pound difference will really count. </p>

<p>My impression is that the Schwinn is compromised to get the low stand-over height, and everything follows from there. That can be important if your dad has limited mobility, but if it's not essential don't buy a bike that adds 10 punds to get it.</p>

<p>Realistically the rest doesn't add up to much - they're both bottom-of-the-range folding bikes that use cheap components and will probably not last very long (a thousand miles or so). I think you need to be clear what you want the bike for and what you expect from it. If your dad is too heavy or rides too much the bike will fall apart quite quickly. Both bikes will be heavy, unweildy luggage when folded.</p>

<p>I would be concerned about the wheels on the Schwinn, the ""6 spoke"" pattern wheels look like a gimmick to me. they might go out of true easily and look hard to fix. But they look pretty. The Schwinn is 7 speed, the Citizen 6 speed, but that's pretty irrelevant as neither bike will cope well with hills or high speeds.</p>

<p>The Schwinn comes with a bag, for the Citizen it's a $29 extra. If that's important to you, it adds 15% to the price of the Citizen. But I think the Citizen is a (slightly) better bike - they've focussed on a basic bike with basic components rather than paying extra for marketting bullet points (""sprung saddle"", ""pretty wheels""), so they can spend a tiny bit more on slightly better parts.</p>

"Mountain bike tires vs. road tires - from crushed limestone to pavement","11148","","<p>I've had my mountain bike for three summers now and I love it.  I bought it for the ability to ride on different terrains and build endurance.  Since my primary goal is weight loss and cardiovascular health, I've found that I ride mostly on paved surfaces during typical rides.  I do often ride on bike trails for long endurance rides.  These trails consistently have crushed limestone surfaces, as well as pavement.</p>

<p>I've considered purchasing road tires due to my extensive presence on pavement, but how well do road tires perform on crushed limestone and/or tightly packed gravel?  Do road tires sink a little on crushed limestone, causing lots of friction?</p>

<p>I don't want to spend the money on the conversion just to find the answer on this question.</p>

<p>I will be riding on paved &amp; crushed limestone/gravel during the same ride.</p>
","<p>Look for city or touring tires.  Road in bicycle means more of a racing tire.   </p>

<p>A tire like this go pavement and packed nicely <a href=""http://www.conti-online.com/www/bicycle_de_en/themes/city/travelcontact_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Travel CONTACT</a>. 
Almost all manufacturers will have tires like this. 
A road type tread in the middle but a little grip on the edges for if you do sink a little. </p>

<p>Great answer from Batman (+1) but I don't think the Gravel Plus is an optimal tire for the needs you state.  One it does not come in a 26 but you did not state that in the original question.  The Gravel Plus is a relatively light race inspired tire.  I commute on cyclycross that I also ride on light trails and I was buying the most roady ""cyclocross"" I could find and was burning through them every 6 months because they are soft light race inspired tires and not designed to be run on the street.  I finally figured out to look in touring / city with a bit of tread.</p>

<p>Yes a 25mm pure road tire will sink in gravel. But don't get a 25mm tire. Get a tire the width of your current knobby or slightly less.</p>

<p>You stated you have 26 X 2.1 now. If you sink a bit now then stay at that width.  If you don't sink then I would drop down to 1.75.</p>

"How much does tire pressure affect the weight of the wheels","11143","","<p>Kind of inspired by <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/21227/how-much-does-rider-weight-increase-tire-pressure"">this question</a>, but something I've been thinking about for a while. </p>

<p>How much does the air in a bike tire weigh?  Is it an appreciable amount? Is there a point where using a wider tire, like at 28c at 80 psi would be lighter than a 25c tire at 100psi? Obviously, this depends on the specific tires used.  I don't have a scale precise enough to measure, and I don't have the math/physics knowledge to figure this out.</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law"">ideal gas law</a> (which is a good approximation in this case) says PV=nRT where P is pressure, V is volume, n is mols of gas, R is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant"">ideal gas law constant</a>, and T is temperature in Kelvin. </p>

<p>Thus, solving for n, we see n = (PV)/(RT). Then, assuming air is made up of {gas1, gas2,...} with fractions {p1,p2,...} (so p1+p2+...=1) and corresponding molar masses {m1,m2,...}, the mass of air in a tire is (PV/(RT))(p1*m1+p2*m2+...). So, what we see is that the mass of air in a tire is directly proportional to the volume of the tire and directly proportional to the pressure in the tire, and inversely proportional to the temperature of the air in the tire. </p>

<p>We will make the following (reasonable) assumptions: Assume the temperature is around room temperature (293 Kelvin) and the volume of the tire regardless of pressure is the same (primarily determined by the shape of the rubber, assuming not severely under/over inflated). For convenience, air is about {nitrogen, oxygen} with {p1,p2}= {0.8,0.2} and molar masses {28 g/mol,32 g/mol}. Thus, under these assumptions (V is fixed, and T is fixed), the mass of the air in tire grows linearly with pressure. </p>

<p>So, the mass of air in a tire of volume V and pressure P and temperature T is about (PV/RT)(0.8*28+0.2*32) grams. It may be better to write it as ""P ((V/(RT)) (0.8*28+0.2*32)) grams"" noting that V/(RT) is a constant for us. </p>

<p>Since I don't want to put the units into <a href=""http://wolframalpha.com"">wolfram alpha</a> carefully, you can put in the entry ""(7 bar* 10 gallons)/(ideal gas constant*293 Kelvin)*(0.8*28+0.2*32)"" and read the result off in grams (ignoring the unit it says there) to get an estimate for the weight of air in a 7 bar (~100 psi), 10 gallon volume tire as around 313 grams. Is 10 gallons reasonable? No. </p>

<p>Lets be crude about estimating the volume of a tube using a torus. The volume of a torus is V=(pi*r^2)(2*pi*R) where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=volume%20of%20a%20torus"">Google</a> will calculate it for you (and has a picture of what major and minor radius is).</p>

<p>I can't be bothered to actually go outside and measure these things, but lets be crude and use a massive tire. Say the minor radius is 2 inches, and the major radius is 15 inches (this is probably larger the size of the tire on something like a Surly Moonlander). This has a volume of about 5 gallons. If you were a nutcase and running this at 7 bar, it would be around 150 grams of air. At a more reasonable 1 bar or 2 bar, youd be at 45 or 90 grams. </p>

<p>What about a thin road bike tire? Lets also assume the major radius is around 15 inches, and the minor radius is around a half inch. Thats around 0.3 gallons of volume. Plugging into our formula, at 7 bar, we see that this is about 9 grams. At 10 bar, a whopping 13.5 grams. </p>

"How do I bleed Avid Elixir brakes","11137","","<p>My bike has a set of Avid Elixir R hydraulic brakes. The front brake barely goes on when I pull the lever and the back brake feels pretty soft. I think I need to bleed them. How do I go about doing this?</p>

<p>I think the brakes got like this because I pressed the brake level when the bike was upside down or when the wheel was removed putting the bike into my car.</p>
","<p>All Avid brakes require the proprietary brake bleed equipment and that a fairly complex procedure is followed. Avid/SRAM sell a brake bleed kit that comprises:</p>

<ul>
<li>two syringes</li>
<li>caliper and level hose barbs with hose and clamps</li>
<li>T10 Torx allen key</li>
<li>DOT 5.1 brake fluid</li>
<li>caliper spreaders to hold the caliper apart while bleeding</li>
</ul>

<p>The kit is quite expensive and several eBay sellers provide a cheaper alternative kits. Any hydraulic brake fluid that complies with the DOT 5.1 standard is suitable for Avid brakes. It is possible to assemble your own brake bleed kit by sourcing some 20ml syringes, M? hose barbs, neoprene hose, hose clamps and using some US quarters or UK 2pence pieces to spread the calliper pistons.</p>

<p>The bleed procedure is documented by SRAM in a youtube video: </p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

<p>The procedure involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>prepare the brake fluid by using a partial vacuum to remove bubbles from the fluid</li>
<li>connect a 50% full syringe to the caliper and 25% full syringe to the lever</li>
<li>close the brake lever and clamp with a rubber band</li>
<li>pull on the caliper syringe gently to remove bubbles from the caliper</li>
<li>push the caliper syringe until around 25% of the fluid has transferred to the lever syringe</li>
<li>open the lever while gently applying pressure to the caliper</li>
<li>remove the caliper syringe and replace the bleed screw</li>
<li>pull gently on the level syringe to remove bubbles from the caliper</li>
<li>apply the brake lever and repeat until all bubbles are removed</li>
<li>remove the lever syringe and replace the bleed screw</li>
<li>clean all traces of brake fluid with alcohol or soapy water</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point you should have properly bled brakes. Test carefully before heading back out on the trail!</p>

If you've got a double up front, especially a double with proper cyclocross gearing (tigher ratio than standard or compact road), the long cage road derailleur should be more than adequate.</p>

<p>I use the <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/product/master-link-pliers-mlp-1"">Park Tool Master Link Pliers</a> to remove master links. I have a hard time believing that doing it that way stresses it significantly.</p>

  <p>""According to SRAM, the ridge that joins the two plates of the PowerLock together can be damaged when unlocking it, increasing the risk of failure if reused. So yes, if you choose to reuse a PowerLock there is an increased likelihood of if failing, according to SRAM.""</p>
  
  <p>I know a number of professional and team mechanics who routinely reuse PowerLocks on their own bikes, but replace them with a new link when dealing with a customer or athlete, so it’s a bit of “do as I say, not as I do.” </p>
</blockquote>
","<p>It's not so much that reusing the link increases the chance that the pins or plates that the Powerlock is made up of will fail, but rather that it increases the chance that the link will come apart the same way it was put together. Each time you remove that link it wears down the ""ridge"" that snaps the pins in place on their opposing plates. This increases the chance that the link can undo itself in unusual circumstances. It may also slightly increase the chance of the link failing in the case of shifting under heavy load, which should be avoided anyway.</p>

<p>SRAMs 9 speed quick links were notorious for coming apart on the trail as they are reusable- some of this had to do with improper removal which damaged the relief that held the pins in place. It's probably easier for the company to just say ""don't do it"" than to say ""do it this way"" and folks don't adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations, leading to failures.</p>

<p>TL;DR version- if you only remove the link on occasion, its good for the life of the chain. Don't reuse an old quick link on a new chain.</p>

","<p>I'll post the results as an answer although I've already accepted a solution.</p>

<p>The bolt extractor did not help me. That's because the bolt was so tight on its nut. I think that the bolt had made a bond with the nut. It was impossible to unscrew it. Initially any attempt to hook the extractor resulted in more alumenium material from the bolt to be extracted. Then I drilled a smaller whole in the center of the bolt and tried with a smaller extractor. It broke.</p>

<p>I also drilled a torx pattern on the bolt's head but the torx also melted the aluminium of the bolt.</p>

<p>I ended up drilling the hell out of the bolts back end where it binds to the nut. When I've drilled a complete circle around the threads of the bolt and nut, I could hammer the bolt out.</p>

"How to fix front gear taking 2 shifts just to move onto next cog","10940","","<p>I was out on a ride yesterday and several times when I was changing up and down between big chain ring and little chain ring (I only have the 2 rings up front) it required 2 gear changes. The gears actually settled on an imaginary middle cog! How can I fix this?</p>
","<p>I think Shimano integrated shifters (""brifters"") for the front derailleur on a triple normally have 5 indexed positions: 1-3-5 are the main positions that match the chainrings and 2-4 are intermediate spots to avoid chain rub for some chainring+sprocket combinations.  If you give the front shift lever a short pull it will click once and the front derailleur moves one position.  Give it a full pull and it should click twice, moving two positions.</p>

<p>Normally going up to a bigger ring requires a 2-click upshift;  sometimes you need to give it a one-click downshift afterwards to eliminate chain rub if you're in a larger rear cog.  Going down a ring may only take a 1-click downshift, depending on what position the derailleur is in.  All of this is based on my experience with a triple, but should work the same for a double.</p>

<p>If shifting problems are more noticable going up to a bigger ring (needs more clicks than before) then this is probably due to cable stretch.  If you have a barrel adjuster on the front derailleur cable, try turning it counterclockwise (looking at it from the side where the cable housing enters it) to tension the cable a bit.</p>

<p>If the problem is when dropping down to a smaller ring, then either the cables are sticking somewhere (worn cables/housing) or the front derailleur is sticking (needs lubrication or has a worn spring). </p>

"How do I get my brakes to stop squealing","10908","","<p>I've tried sanding them down just a bit, cleaning the brake surface on the wheels, and this does stop them from squealing for a day or two, but it always comes back.  I'm using Kool-stop pads if it matters.</p>
","<p>There are a few causes for brake 'squealing':</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>New pads.</strong> After a bit of wear (or sandpapering), the squealing will stop.</li>
<li><strong>Misalignment.</strong> As some others have mentioned, misalignment may cause squealing (although it would be reduced with some wear). Check out <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/canti-direct.html"">Sheldon Brown's tips</a> for alignment suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Oil or water on the rim.</strong> Either of these substances, even in small portions, combined with dirt or debris on the rim can create squealing. Wipe the rims thoroughly on the braking surface, as  well as the pads, with a dry cloth.</li>
<li><strong>Incompatible rims/pads.</strong> No one else has mentioned this, but this is often the most common cause. Rims are generally made from one of two materials: steel or alloy. (You can tell the difference by seeing if a magnet will attract (steel) or not (alloy)). Incidentally, brake pads are made of specific compounds to work on one or the other. Often, using pads designed for alloy rims (like most Kool-Stops) will squeal if used on steel (which I'm guessing you have).</li>

"How to care for a steel frame?","10908","","<p>I'm considering getting a steel frame to upgrade from my aluminum xc bike. As it will be my first steel frame I'd like to understand if there is more after ride care required than my current bike. Usually after rides now I generally just wipe off the staunchions and wash only on the weekends. If I had a steel frame that had been rust proofed would I have to do much different?</p>
","<p>I ride a steel frame fixed gear nearly daily in tropical conditions, and near the sea. It really puts the frame through its paces. As far as my experience goes, there's nothing that can be totally rust proofed.</p>

<p>Using any sort of metal lubricant on the inside of the tubes will certainly help prolong the life of your steel frame. Some may insist on using the tried and proven J.P. Weigle's Frame Saver. The seat tube and bottom bracket are where rust forms the quickest, as moisture gets to them easily. Always remember to lube them, especially after wet rides, as the lubricants can be easily washed away by tire spray and water seeping between the crevices.</p>

<p>Apart from the inside of the frame, do note that the quality of the paint/clear coat has a great impact on how ""rust-proof"" the frame is. If the paintwork is chipped, which can easily happen if you ride often, there's a chance that the frame will start rusting from the chip.</p>

<p>Do care for your steel frame as you did with the aluminum frame. It may be prone to more visible wear and tear, but as long as you take care of it, it's bound to last a lifetime. Steel frames are durable and great to ride on. It's worth the time to take care and maintain them.</p>

<p>As an extra precaution, I remove almost all the components, except for the crankset/bottom bracket, and give them a thorough wipe down and re-lube once every two months.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I think my riding position is more upright than leaned forward, but I couldn't say how much because I don't have a feel for it.</p>
","<p>I can think of a few possible explanations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you're sitting too upright, vibrations from the road/trail (anything from pavement quality to serious potholes) will travel straight up your spine, causing your the gaps between your vertebrae to expand and contract.  This can add up on a long ride.  Ideally you want to be leaning forward enough that your back has at least a slight arch to it so that your muscles absorb the impact instead of your spine.  Suspension (either rear or a sprung saddle/seatpost) can help here too.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're riding with your elbows locked, or letting your shoulders sag then again you're letting your inflexible skeleton take the shocks instead of letting your muscles do the work.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're leaned too far forward, then you'll constantly be craning your neck upwards to see the road ahead.  The solution here is to raise your handlebars and/or shorten the stem length.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, long rides require stretching out muscles that tend to get stay in the same position all the time.  This is especially true for your upper body and neck.  Either stop to stretch or learn how to some basic stretches while riding.  If I didn't stretch my neck periodically, I'd be a mess after a 10+ hour ride!</p></li>

"What do I need to research to switch to an internally geared hub?","10863","","<p>I have a bike that I rather like, but it's geared entirely for high-speed road bike type work.  It's fantastic on the flat areas of the route that I take every day, but I also have a couple of serious hills that I cannot climb with this one (I can climb them with a different bike).</p>

<p>So, I'm looking at the possibility of saving money to replace the entire bike, or to regear it.  An option that I saw today was something like the Shimano Alfine 11-speed hubs.  I've not calculated gear ratios, but it's claimed that they have a very wide range and such a thing would benefit me.</p>

<p>So, if I wanted to retrofit my bike to an internally geared hub, what is involved (and what are the terms I'm looking for)?</p>

<ul>
<li>size of axle?</li>
<li>distance across the rear fork?</li>
<li>what to do with no-longer-used rear derailleur?</li>
<li>will my existing grip-shifter need to be replaced, and does that entail anything other than just putting the new one on and attaching the wires?</li>
<li>will my entire rear wheel need to be replaced?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm pretty vague on what industry terminology would be used in this case.  I'm also trying to evaluate the viability of even doing this as I balance my options for adjusting or replacing the bike to better fit the city I live in.  The only adjustment I haven't mentioned is for me to replace the front chainring (there's only one on this bike) with something a little smaller.  I'd lose level-ground power but gain some climbing power.  And that, really, might be the least expensive and easiest of all of my options.</p>
","<p>The <strong>first</strong> thing you should be looking into is gearing to ensure that an internally geared hub will work for you! The more you pay, the more gear range you get out of a hub, but even the nicest internally geared hubs don't match the spread of standard mountain bike gearing.<br><br>
If you've decided that an Alfine 11 hub is for you then to answer your questions in order:<br><br>
-the axle size shouldn't be an issue.<br>
-the hub spacing is 135mm. That's mountain bike spacing typically. Apparently it can be adapted down to 130mm but I'm not going to detail how to do that here<br>
-sell it/keep it/ use it as a paperweight<br>
-The hub will have a dedicated shifter. I seem to remember that there are both trigger and grip shift options. Should fit without issue, though you'll probably have to take your grips/bar tape off.<br>
-Yes, unless you have an incredibly nice rim with the proper drilling that you want to re-use.<br><br>
You will also need a chain tensioner if your bike does not have horizontal/track-style dropouts, which I doubt it does. I believe there's one that goes along with the Alfine that Shimano sells as an accessory, though I don't think you have to have that particular one.</p>

<p>It doesn't click, however, if you just pedal it with your hands, but seems to have something to do with putting your weight on it when you're actually riding.</p>

<p>Should I just take it in again? Or is there something cheaper I could look at?</p>
","<p>The problem could be the lubrication on the rear hub. Perhaps it wasn't well greased at the factory. A tune-up should have caught this problem, particularly as you mentioned it. Another possibility is that there is a ball bearing missing from the rear hub, so that once every time the wheel turns around, the axle falls into the small gap created by the missing bearing (this happened on my daughter's new bike after about 3 months of occasional riding).</p>

<p>If the bike is still under warranty, then I would take it in. The problem should have been fixed the first time.</p>

<p>If you want to try fixing it yourself, you will have to take off the rear wheel and disassemble the hub. This isn't hard, but if you've never done it before, try finding a local bike shop that will show you how. Some towns have co-op bike repair shops where for a small fee you can use their tools and there will be a mechanic on hand to guide you.

I'm assuming this is a pretty basic crankset since it lies at the bottom of their <a href=""http://www.fullspeedahead.com/category_list/19/CRANKSETS"">product list</a>.</p>

<p>Would there be a substantial improvement by upgrading to something nicer? My (uneducated) guesses are that a higher end crankset would be lighter (e.g made from carbon) and possibly have less flex under power application.</p>
","<p>They will definitely be lighter, and probably shift a little better. More rigid is possible but not especially likely, as the cheap one will be strong enough to take a lot of abuse (they don't particularly care about weight so that's easy to do). </p>

<p>(edit) A cheap crankset very likely has the chainrings rivetted on, and they're not designed to be changed. Sometimes the smallest chainring is bolted on and can be changed. Swapping one of these for a more expensive one that has interchangeable chainrings will probably give better shifting.</p>

<p>Cheap bikes are the ones more likely to be bought by people who either weigh a lot or are careless with their bikes, so are more likely to be overloaded. More expensive bikes get crashed instead. The cranks are designed accordingly.</p>

<p>As discussed in  <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/4063/suggestions-for-progressive-upgradation-of-bike"">Suggestions for progressive upgradation of bike</a> you're almost certainly better off saving up for a more expensive bike rather than trying to upgrade the one you have.

<p>Look at the picture of the bike. See how the distance between the top tube and the down tube is quite narrow up by the head tube? It's possible that with the smaller sizes of this bike, there isn't enough room to fit both of the bike rack's posts inside that triangle.</p>

<p>However, that bike comes in 3 different sizes. The bigger sizes have a longer head tube and a longer top tube, so there's more room.</p>

<p>If the bike fits on the rack without that ""beam"" bar, there's really no significant problem. There won't be any rack stability issues, since the weight of the bike really doesn't change much with that tilt. The handlebars probably won't tilt far enough to hit anything. It's possible that it will interfere with fitting 3 bikes on the rack, since the rear wheel will be up where the bike next to it's handlebars need to go.</p>

"Why does pedalling backwards not move my bike backwards?","10685","","<p>On the Mountain bike I have, pedalling backwards moves the chain but doesn't drive the wheels of the bike backwards like you would expect it to. Why is this?</p>
","<p>Do you hear a ""tick"" sound every time you spin the wheel anti-clockwise? that's the freewheel mechanism composed by two small parts called ""pawls"" and when you spin it on that direction, those pawls turn loosely until they find the ""dent"" in the inner mechanism (the ratchet body), that's when the ""tick"" sound happens.</p>

"Which type of frame is better for a touring bike, steel or aluminium?","10671","","<p>I hear that a steel frame is more comfortable to ride for a long tour but that it is heavier and easier to rust than aluminum.
Which material is better for a touring frame?</p>
","<p>Steel is still very common for relatively expensive ""touring"" bikes (bikes intended for long distances carrying panniers).  The slight additional weight of a steel frame over aluminum (well less than 10 pounds in most cases) is inconsequential when you have 40-100 pounds of gear on the bike, the bike is more durable, and the flexibility of a steel bike is preferred by many on a long ride.</p>

<p>Aluminum is more rigid because the tubes must be made fatter and thicker to achieve the same yield strength as steel.  In some contexts this additional stiffness may be appreciated, but generally not when riding long distances.</p>

<p>Stainless is hardly ever (never?) used for bikes because it's too hard to work with and the metallurgy doesn't allow the characteristics of the material to be  controlled nearly as well as steel or aluminum.  And its heavy.</p>

<p>Carbon fiber is carbon fiber.  Great for lightweight frames (saves another 2-5 pounds, maybe), great for bragging rights, but fragile and often excessively rigid.</p>

<p>One important consideration on a cross-country ride is that a steel frame is very unlikely to suffer fatigue failure, while the other materials are considerably more likely to do this.  (And, in a pinch, a steel frame can be repaired by a welder at a local auto or tractor shop, while a broken aluminum or carbon frame is likely toast.)  (Of course, any good quality frame that isn't overloaded should hold up to a 3000 mile journey, but sometimes things happen.)</p>

<p>The tendency of a steel bike to rust is of little consequence.  A steel bike would need to be exposed to the weather constantly for 20 years before rust would cause a failure, and at that point all of the components would have already disintegrated.  And I don't know about carbon, but aluminum and stainless steel tend to suffer crystallization of the metal at the welds as they corrode, and this can lead to sudden joint failure.</p>

"What are the differences (and their practical implications) between a 29"" mountain bike and a cyclocross bicycle?","10666","","<p>I am considering the purchase of a bicycle for riding off road, and have heard a lot of buzz about 29"" mountain bikes. However, I am not particularly interested in technical riding - although I would like to be able to ride through most things, even if I have to do so slowly.</p>

<p>I am leaning to a CX bike because I am familiar with the handle bars and geometry. However, the 29"" also ride very smoothly. I can see that the tires, handlebars, suspension, and geometry are different, but what are the consequences of these differences that I need to consider?</p>

<p><strong>Mountain Bike:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W9f9N.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Cyclocross Bike:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1nss.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>There are a few very good answers on here already, however, I feel that a few pointers have been overlooked.</p>

<h3>Height</h3>

<p>I am not sure whether 29-ers suit all riders. Height comes into it, a 29-er imposes a high handlebar and heavier wheels than a 26"" MTB. IMHO you need to be 6"" or taller for the big wheel to make sense.</p>

<h3>Standover height</h3>

<p>The distance between you and the top tube is important on a MTB, regardless of your skill level. Most MTB's have a 'compact geometry' with big seat-post. Out the saddle it is useful to not have a 'five bar gate' between your legs, so, if you do go for the MTB, err on the smaller rather than the larger frame. You don't get this with CX bikes as a rule, although I would not be surprised if Giant do make one.</p>

<h3>Brakes</h3>

<p>Most 29-ers (if not all) come with disc brakes. CX bikes can come with discs but that is the exception rather than the rule. Disc brakes give much better stopping power, with little need for the rims to clean first. This gives you much better control.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Cyclo-cross pre-dates MTB-ing by some decades and the bikes for the sport evolved from road bikes. Meanwhile, the MTB evolved from a few Californians wanting to have fun, any notion of competition came along later. They were not tied down by UCI rules and UCI rules have always served to hinder rather than advance bicycle design. CX bikes are essentially a legacy product, for a 'formula' sport, not 'pure evolution'. They were not that popular before the mountain biking boom and have not been subsequently. Meanwhile, the separately evolved MTB is the 'weapon of choice' for many, many cyclists and CX ideas such as drop bars have not lasted long on MTB's (they have been tried by Johnny Tomac and Specialized did make a 'Rock-Combo' model with them, this was short lived). Wisdom of the crowds is that the MTB rocks off-road.</p>

<h3>Suspension</h3>

<p>For a long time I thought Suspension was a solution looking for a problem. However, there is suspension and there is suspension. A full suspension top end bike by the likes of Cannondale is amazing off road, you can roll over anything without losing speed or control. Cheap suspension is no good at all, i.e. the effort you get on a £300 MTB, perhaps useful for going up a kerb but that is about it. Modern, expensive full-suspension bikes are ridiculously light for how much is going on and a delight to ride. Well worth the investment, unless you are going XC with a bit of road to get to the trail in which case a hard-tail with front lockout is better for the ride as a whole.</p>

<h3>Other uses</h3>

<p>If you are a road-bike person then you probably carry nothing. Sometimes it is useful to have a bike you can carry stuff with. An MTB is really well suited to putting a rack on the back and carrying <em>stuff</em>. That may be just a trip to the shops or a long distance tour. Whatever your choice - CX or MTB, do look for those magical eyelets on the rear dropout for putting a rack on there. It may not be what you want to do now, but down the line it just might well be.</p>

"What is the simplest way to lower the gearing on my touring bike?","10656","","<p>I have a 2004 Jamis Aurora with a 52/42/30 triple and an 11-32 cassette in the back. 30x32 (25.3 gear inches) being the lowest gear is frustrating for the hilly terrain where I live (e.g., 7% grade average over several miles, with higher local steepness), and so I'd like to lower my gearing.</p>

<p>I'd like advice on how to most simply do this. The basic problem is that replacing any given part appears to have cascading compatibility issues which may or may not be solvable, and I'm becoming confused.</p>

<p>I do use the full range up to 52x11 (127.6 gear inches), but only on descents that are fast anyway, so I am happy to lose the higher gears and coast instead. There is essentially no level terrain where I live.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant specs</strong> (all parts stock in 2004):</p>

<ul>
<li>9 speed</li>
<li>Crankset: Truvativ Touro 52/42/30, 130/74mm BCD</li>
<li>Front derailleur: Sora 28.6mm, clamped</li>
<li>Cassette: SRAM 11-32</li>
<li>Rear derailleur: Deore SGS</li>
<li>Shifters: Tiagra</li>
<li>Bottom bracket: TruVativ sealed cartridge, 68 x 113mm</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Options that I've found so far:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Add a larger cog in back</strong>, such as the new <a href=""http://harriscyclery.net/product/shimano-hg-61-12-36-9-speed-cassette-3054.htm"">Shimano 12-36 cassette</a>. As far as I can tell, this will require a <a href=""http://harriscyclery.net/product/shimano-slx-rd-m662-rear-derailleur-sgs-shadow-type-3061.htm"">new rear derailleur</a> and a new chain, but that's it. This makes the lowest gear <strong>30x36 (22.5 gear inches), 12.5% lower</strong>, and the highest 52x12 (117 gear inches). A downside is the excessive size of the rear cassette.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replace the crankset,</strong> for example with a <a href=""http://harriscyclery.net/product/sugino-xd500-110-74mm-48-36-24-teeth-445.htm"">48-36-24</a>. This makes the lowest gear <strong>24x32 (20.3 gear inches), 25% lower</strong>, and the highest 48x11 (118 gear inches). At first glance, this one is the most appealing, but it seems to also raise the thorniest compatibility questions; the ones I'm aware of so far are (a) finding a front derailleur which is compatible with both my road shifters and the smaller large chainring (<a href=""http://harriscyclery.net/product/ird-alpina-d-compact-road-triple-front-derailleur-2435.htm"">one possibility</a>), and (b) differing chainline offsets of road and MTB cranksets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swap in a lower granny chainring</strong>, say 24 teeth, resulting in a 52/42/24 crankset. My concerns here are (a) whether my derailleur can handle the 18-tooth jump between low and middle and/or the lowness of the granny gear, (b) the awkwardly wide jump between low and middle (75%, or about 5 sprockets), and (c) retaining very high gears that are feasible only for making a fast descent faster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swap in 3 new chainrings.</strong> This seems to raise similar concerns to item 2. </p></li>
</ol>
","<p>I think everyone has provided some pretty sound advice, especially Daniel Hicks and his recommendation to go with the quickest and cost effective option by replacing your chainrings! With a 130/74 BCD, an ideal setup would be to swap in a 24/36/48 which would give you a great range at a cheap price.   </p>

<p>The front derailleur is probably the least necessary component on your bike and, while shifting compatibility is a concern, I would recommend swapping in your new chainrings and setting everything up to test for compatibility before spending more money on a new derailleur. I have used mountain FDs on road triples and road FDs on mountain triples with a variety of indexed and non-indexed shifters and have had very little trouble over the years. Really, the only requirement is ensuring that the front derailleur is a triple and has the correct seat tube diameter/pull direction. (Your cascade of compatibility issues is something I've dealt with, but don't worry! There are lots of manufacturers who design compatibility issues into their gear, but they generally don't cater to the average touring enthusiast.)</p>

<p>Since you have an SGS derailleur (long-cage) you shouldn't have any issue with chain slack. For touring, the Deore SGS set up with an 11-32 is a great choice. At most, you may prefer to remove 1 or 2 links just to clean everything up. (I ride in New England on 24/38/48 x 13-32 and even with a full load I maybe walk it once a year).</p>

<p>When you start changing components such as your crankset you have to deal with special tools, frame clearance issues, bottom bracket fit, and Q-factor (the horizontal distance between your pedals). Mountain cranks have smaller BCDs but have much wider Q-factors which, for some people, can cause knee and hip irritation (which is exacerbated by long rides and clipless pedals). Long story short, if you are comfortable with your bikes ergonomics on long rides, leave it (or give yourself enough time to work out the bugs before attempting a 2k fully loaded). </p>

<p>Otherwise, take things one step at a time. If smaller chainrings don't give you enough oomph, throw on a new cassette which is quick and has few compatibility issues (12-36 is a common low touring range). More compact road cranks have a 110/74 BCD which won't help you on the low end (though, if your leg length permits a longer crank arm it might provide a very small advantage). Some mountain cranks have BCDs as low as 58mm x 20t, but I suspect that this option may be more trouble than it is worth. Some handy online gear resources include: rivbike.com, velo-orange.com, universalcycles.com, and sheldonbrown.com.</p>

<p>A cheaper way to ease the inherent suffering of long, steep climbs would be to trim some bike fat and touring load (a good technical and philosophical resource might be The Ultralight Backpacker by Ryel Kestenbaum or Just Ride by Grant Petersen). Some people might recommend trimming some actual fat, but we live in a world where everyone gets to ride a bike, not just 130 pound-25-year-olds. (No offense to the 25-year-old cyclists out there!)</p>

"Can the Tensioner Spring go Bad on a Rear Derailleur?","10654","","<p>My bike chain has been ""skipping"", so I've gone through the obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li>I replaced the chain</li>
<li>I replaced the smallest cassette cog, which was showing significant wear</li>
</ul>

<p>After my replacements I noticed what the real problem was. Every once in a while, rather than the chain being pulled into the valeys of the rear cog, a chain link land on the tooth, and will not roll into the cog's valley and engage. Each subsequent link of the chain will land on a tooth. When the last engaged link begins to leave the valley, all the disengaged links will be snapped back into engagement by the rear derailleur.</p>

<p>What's going on here? Is my rear derailleur's tensioner spring just too old?</p>
","<p>The tensioner spring is designed to keep the entire chain under tension, even after it passes the crank.  So, the symptom of a too-weak tensioner is slack in the chain between the crank and tensioner.  </p>

<p>It sounds like the distance between chain links is not quite the same as the distance between valleys in your sprockets.  This is not unusual if you replaced a very worn chain (because the sprockets would have worn to match the old chain).  It's also not impossible that the sprockets are worn not quite enough to match the old, worn out chain, yet still worn too much to match the brand new chain.  You may need to replace the rest of the sprockets in the cassette.  </p>

"Disc brakes squeak on Trek mountain bike","10634","","<p>I have a Trek 3900 mountain bike with disc brakes, and I just took it out of winter storage to start riding it for the season.<br>
Everything works well, except for one very annoying problem: when I stop the disc brakes make an extremely loud obnoxious squealing sound. Any ideas of what is causing this?<br>
Thanks</p>
","<p>The easy thing to check is whether the pads have got a little damp while you weren't riding it. The solution there is to ride it a bit. If the noise bothers you try riding with the brake slightly on to heat it up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that conflicts with the other problem: if there's oil on the rotor you should clean it immediately and avoid using the brake until you can clean it (to avoid getting oil in the pads because they're hard to clean). Wipe the rotor with either disk cleaner or rubbing alcohol and a clean cloth. Keep doing that with new solvent and new cloth until no further dirt comes off the rotor. Then take a quick test ride, using the brake. Ideally pedal hard with the brake on, so you heat the pads and rotor (and also get an idea of whether the brake works). Remember that riding with the brakes on heats up the rotors - be careful touching them immediately afterwards. Wipe the rotor with a clean cloth to remove any pad goop.</p>

<p>If there was no squeal last summer the alignment should be fine. The way to check is to look at the gaps between the pas an rotors. Check from a couple of different angles, the pad should be parallel to the rotor from all angles. If it's not try squeezing the lever - some pads pull slightly off angle when they come off the disk.</p>

<p>If all else fails buy new pads, clean the rotors then install the new pads. Remember that the new pads will need a little running in.</p>

"How to significantly lower HR[avg] while improving performance output","10572","","<p>On my Saturday's ascent race I was riding 181bpm HR<sub>AVG</sub> and saved some power for the last km where my HR peaked at 190 (which is my highest ever recorded HR at my 37 years or age). I felt rather normal at the top, no fatigue or extreme oxygen deficiency. Just normal very deep breathing with high frequency for about 20 seconds and I was fine. the way I usually breathe on the <em>doing it 100%</em> races.</p>

<p><a href=""http://connect.garmin.com/activity/112037608"" rel=""nofollow"">This is the data</a> from my Garmin of this ascent race.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should point out that my calculated HR<sub>MAX</sub> is about 182bpm although in reality it's clearly 190 (as the upper data shows). I suspect it's even higher, but anyway. I was obviously pedalling at 95-100% HR for about 50 minutes. That's surprising to me. This to me may be a good indicator that my HR<sub>MAX</sub> is closer to 200bpm rather than 190 which would mean I was peddaling at 90% HR<sub>MAX</sub> most of the time. <strong>Can anyone confirm this reasoning?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>As I've heard some of the others were riding well below 170 bpm HR<sub>AVG</sub> but had much better time than me. I suppose this is due to larger heart volume, larger lungs therefore much better oxygen efficiency. Since my heart rate increases quite rapidly I suspect my heart volume is rather small(ish) so it has to speed up faster to deliver the needed O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><strong>I wonder how can I improve my performance</strong>? What kind of training will lower my heart rate while keeping the same performance level. I suppose lowering my HR by 10 bpms would give me enough room to improve my performance by more than 10%.</p>
","<p>First off, understand that HR drops as you age, even if you stay in good physical shape.  Older riders will tend to have a lower HR.</p>

<p>In addition, HR drops as you become better conditioned to high-output activity.  Basically, as you suggest, the capacity of the heart and circulatory system increases so that sufficient oxygenated blood can be delivered to the muscles at a lower HR.</p>

<p>Also, as one trains, the muscles develop more anaerobic capacity, so they need less oxygen, and they develop more glycogen storage capacity, so they need less blood sugar.</p>

<p>Others probably have more specific suggestions based on research, but basically to train the circulatory system (and muscles) you keep repeating the conditions where you want it to perform.  Some accommodation occurs within a few days (mainly in the form of hormone levels and blood volume), while full accommodation probably takes 6 months or so of every-other-day full-out rides.</p>

"What are the differences between road rims/wheels and hybrid?","10548","","<p>I recently purchased a carbon fiber wheel for my bike. It turns out the wheel isn't right for my hybrid bike for a number of reasons: brake availability, hub diameter, rim width, etc.</p>

<p>So now I'm on the market for a performance rim that will fit my hybrid bike. But I don't know, when looking at the specs for a rim/wheel, what I need to look for to ensure this is the right wheel for my bike.</p>

<p>What are the specs / measurements / features that determine whether a rim is designed to fit a road bike vs. a hybrid/commuter bike?</p>
","<h2>Hub Width</h2>

<p>On road, mountain, and hybrid, the front hubs are 100mm in width. On road bicycles the rear is typically 130mm, where on a MTB it is typically 135mm. Measure this from your old hub, and DON'T stretch/force a different hub width.</p>

<h2>Wheel (Rim) Diameter</h2>

<p>The most typical road rim is a 700c which will mean the bead seat diameter of the rim is 622mm, and the typical mountain bicycle will either have 26"" (559mm BSD), 29"" (622mm), or one of each. There are many non-typical sizes, however, so see <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sheldon Brown's Tire Sizing Page</a>.</p>

<p>While some of this is rim sizing, it's the overall wheel size that matters - note that 29"" MTB and 700c rims have the same BSD, but are unlikely to work well or fit at all (without serious brake modifications, to say the least).</p>

<p>If you want to see what various rim/tire combinations look like visually to compare them to your current setup, you can pick various ones (and see the resulting measurements in mm) <a href=""http://wheelspoking.com/Build.aspx?Mode=Basic"" rel=""noreferrer"">on a site I built</a>.</p>

<h2>Brake Compatibility</h2>

<p>You're either going to have rim brakes, which require rims specifically made with a braking surface and additional strengthening in that area (read: a bit heavier), or disc brakes which require a hub that can accept a disc rotor (and matching disc mounts on the frame and/or fork).</p>

<p>For best results, if you have rim brakes and don't plan to upgrade, get a non-disc hub and rim brake designed rim, and if you have disc brakes then get disc compatible hubs and rims without a braking surface (disc brake rims). This will lessen the additional (unused) weight and likely shave off some cost as well, but it is possible to have a rim brake rim with a disc hub.</p>

<p>With some road-style (caliper) brakes, you may have to adjust or even replace the brakes if you vary too far from their rim/tire clearance capabilities, so for best results stay somewhat close to what you had (or have the possibility of replacing brakes as well). V-Brakes, cantilever, and disc brakes are more forgiving on rim/tire size variances.</p>

<h2>Tire Width</h2>

<p>This is the most tricky part on a hybrid, as their tires (and thus rims) are typically somewhere between a MTB (1.8"", 1.9"", 2.0"", 2.1"", 2.3"" being common) and a road bike (18mm, 20mm, 23mm, 25mm and 28mm being common). You'll need to use a caliper where the tire fits through the forks and frame to get a handle on your maximum size (allowing for some clearance) and then selecting a desired tire width up to that maximum.</p>

<h2>Rim Width</h2>

<p>This needs to match the desired / compatible tire width, see below (from <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sheldon Brown's site</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EwkOp.png"" alt=""Tire and Rim Compatibility""></p>

","<p>If a bike hasn't been ridden but stored in a nice environment (e.g. a garage) for a few years and it was in good condition when it was put in, all you have to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dust it off</p></li>

<p>300 gentle miles on a bike is practically new. A bicycle sitting idle for 5 years is pretty much nothing.

(I'd probably do a mechanical check on everything on the bike as well, but I suppose its not strictly necessary if the bike hasn't been touched in a long time)</p>

<p>I hesitate to answer this somewhat, since it somewhat verges on product recommendation, but the components on the 7.5 fx are better quality and compatible parts will be available for essentially the same amount of time as the 7.2 fx (pretty much all of them are cross compatible with whats on the 7.2 fx anyway, except the crankset + bb which is octalink vs jis, both extremely easy to get though). If the 7.5 fx is in excellent condition, it is the one I'd go for (possibly <a href=""http://www.bicyclebluebook.com/SearchListingDetail.aspx?id=19890&amp;make=750&amp;model=58263&amp;year=2010"" rel=""nofollow"">talking down the price a bit</a>). </p>

"What options do I have when replacing my fork's elastomers?","10502","","<p>I'm rebuilding an AntiGravity Fork and converting it to threadless for my 'Blast From the Past' bike (GT Bravado frame, U-Brake, Bullseye hubs and cranks, 21 speed). I really like these forks and I'd like to bring them back to life.</p>

<p>The elastomers are shot. Some are falling apart, others are crushed and don't expand fully, etc. Given that the company is out of business and the chance of locating brand new AntiGravity elastomers is.... not good, I'm looking at what my options are.</p>

<p><em>AntiGravity Elastomer Fork:</em> <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/1BK6S.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Picture</a></p>

<p><strong>Option A:</strong> Wings-Suspension makes killer kits to convert Manitou/RockShox elastomer forks to springs. I emailed them with pictures and details to see if his springs would be compatible, but that's VERY doubtful. This would be my Option A if it worked.</p>

<p><em>Wings Replacement Springs:</em> <a href=""http://wings-suspension.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Link</a> | <a href=""http://wings-suspension.com/steelsprings.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Picture</a></p>

<p><strong>Option B:</strong> Round Tubing from McMasters-Carr. I have been trying to just get something to replace them with, at this point. The main suspension uses 4x 1.25"" OD 1/4"" ID elastomers, and the rebound is controlled by 6x 3/4"" OD 3/16"" ID elastomers.  McMaster-Carr seems to have close to what I'm looking for, with multiple choices:</p>

<p><em>Main Elastomers:</em> Neoprene Spring Rubber with 75A Durometer (hard) or Extreme Temperature Silicone Rubber in 60A (medium-hard).</p>

<p><em>Rebound Elastomers:</em> Only in 1/4"" ID (slightly bigger than stock). They have Neoprene Spring Rubber in 75A (hard), Oil Resistant Buna-N Rubber in 75A (hard), and Extreme Temperature Silicone Rubber in 60A (medium-hard).</p>

<p><strong>Option C:</strong> ??? (short of buying a new fork)</p>

<p>An answer can either be a link to better replacement material, or which types of the options above are best for a 180-190 lb rider. It would also be really helpful if someone could find a data sheet for this fork showing what the different original durometers were.</p>

<p>In addition, has anyone ever done this before? should I cut them into 4x1.25"" and 6x1"" pieces, or leave them as one long tube since I'm not swapping them out individually (one of the 'perks' when these were sold)? Does anyone know how to estimate desired durometer / fork force for a given rider weight or desired stiffness? I'd rather be on the stiff side, but I have no idea what 75A or 60A mean in this context - they could be so squishy I bottom them out, or so hard I might as well get a rigid fork.</p>

","<p>I went down to a LBS in Minneapolis, The Shockspital, and had a long conversation with a guy that had lots of spare parts, elastomers, springs, and lots of wisdom. He's done many elastomer-spring conversions, and here's how I'm setting it up:</p>

<p>The bottom larger elastomers that handled the load are being replaced with 5"" of spring, with an elastomer inside of them providing a small amount of rebound damping by resisting the rebound of the spring, and some compression damping after 40% of the spring is compressed (the yellow elastomers on the rods in the picture). It's the long spring in the picture which will be cut and ground into two 5"" segments.</p>

<p>The top smaller elastomers that provide the rebound force and compression damping are being replaced with an all-weather elastomer, all in once 6"" piece (the purple elastomers on the rods at the top).</p>

<p>Then I ordered Prothane polyurethane/urethane safe grease to coat the elastomers, rods, and fork internals with to prevent stiction. All in all, this should be a very responsive fork with some interesting characteristics, that will be a bit on the stiffer side of things for my weight.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, he's tried many times with the McMasters-Carr tubing, and it REALLY sucks. It's far too soft to be of any use in forks. It's made of a completely different material (I tried drilling out a piece of it, which didn't work at all and left black slime in my hand). Don't bother with it. I may have been able to use it in this case, because I'm adding a spring and have elastomers resisting compression in two places, but it's not worth the hassle and doesn't have the same type of characteristics of MCU.</p>

"What is a narrow wide chainring and what are its benefits and drawbacks?","10346","","<p>What is a narrow wide chain and what are it's benefits and drawbacks?</p>

<p>Also, is a specific chainring or cassette required?</p>
","<p>You're probably thinking of narrow-wide <strong>chainrings</strong>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMwmd.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMwmd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Modern chains have <strong>inner</strong> and <strong>outer</strong> links.  On a conventional chainring, all of the teeth are the same width, and therefore have to be narrow enough to fit into the chain's inner links.  This means that there's enough space for the chain to move about a bit from side to side on the chainring, which can cause it to fall off.</p>

<p>Historically this hasn't been much of a problem, since on geared bikes the front derailleur cage tends to stop it from falling off, and on single-speed bikes there's no chain slack or gear changing at the rear to cause chain-drop.</p>

<p>However, when you remove the front derailleur, but keep the rear derailleur (as is becoming common with single-ring setups), dropping the chain becomes more of a problem.  This can happen when changing gear on the cassette, or when a bump causes the chain to go slack momentarily.</p>

<p>Narrow-wide chainrings have alternating <strong>narrow</strong> and <strong>wide</strong> teeth that fit into the <strong>inner</strong> and <strong>outer</strong> links respectively.  This makes the chain more secure on the chainring and less likely to fall off.</p>

<p>A narrow-wide ring is only necessary if you have a single chainring at the front <em>and</em> a rear derailleur.  They won't work at all if you have more than one chainring at the front, since you won't be able to change gear.  You don't need a special cassette, but you might benefit from using a clutched rear derailleur (particularly on a MTB), which prevents the chain from going slack on bumpy terrain.</p>

<p>A well-established alternative to a narrow-wide ring is a <strong>chain guide</strong>, which behaves somewhat like a front derailleur in keeping the chain from falling off:</p>

When I'm in the low gear climbing, there is a lot of chain/derailleur noise. It gets more noticeable when the drive is under more tension. Being in the low gear, the chain angle is fairly minimal, so I am really perplexed. The sound almost mimics when the chain rubs against a front derailleur when the chain is at a drastic angle rubbing against the side.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I am wearing out my drive train too quickly because something is not adjusted correctly.  My old 2 x 10 was virtually silent.</p>

<p>Addition, when going downhill and pedaling, the chain was slipping teeth quite often.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>After replacing the bottom bracket and spending the rest of the season fighting the noise, I have decided it's coming from the SRAM X style teeth on the front chain ring.  When the drive train is squeaky clean the noise is minimal. However after a ride or two the noise starts to come back.  It's only there when the drive train is under heavy load.  It sounds awful, like my chain and teeth are grinding together.  I can only assume it's the X teeth, anyone else confirm this on their 1 X 11?</p>
","<p>Even though you mentioned in a comment that the high and low seemed to be adjusted properly, it still sounds to me like the 'L' limit of the rear derailleur is improperly set and does not allow the upper guide pulley to fully move the chain onto your largest cog. </p>

<p>If this is indeed the case, shift into the largest cog and  adjust the 'L' limit screw (the outermost 3mm adjusting screw) until the center of the upper guide pulley is aligned with the center of the largest cog.</p>

<p>Another possibility is the chain gap is not properly set. The chain gap for the XX1 groupset should be between 12 and 16mm and should be set while the chain is shifted onto the largest cog. You adjust this with the single 3mm adjusting screw located by the derailleur mounting point. Make sure the limit screws are properly adjusted before checking or changing this setting.</p>

<p>The chain gap is the distance between the top of the teeth on the upper guide pulley and the top of the teeth of the largest cog as shown in the following illustration from the <a href=""https://sram-cdn-pull-zone-gsdesign.netdna-ssl.com/cdn/farfuture/kTJuag6NjazdsQvA1SYu56pookx3XA0PTKROIsm3h6c/mtime:1372788191/sites/default/files/techdocs/95-7518-003-000_rev_d_1x11_mtb_rear_derailleurs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">User Manual for SRAM 1x11 rear derailleurs</a>:</p>

My LBS has had several customers (including me) experience issues with the 1x11 cassettes for which the ultimate solution was SRAM sending out replacement cassettes and chains.

","<p>That particular bike looks like it has mounting points for a rear rack, which is the primary issue. In general, what you are looking for are the bolt holes or ""braze-ons"" usually just a few inches below where the seat stays connect to the seat tube, as well as ones above the rear axle on the dropout.

<p>If you can mount a rear rack you will find that most panniers are ""universal"" in that they will mount to any tubular rack. There are a few pannier bags that are sold as part of a system and work only with one specific rack, so you will want to watch out for those.</p>

<p>The second issue will be the length of the chain stays. If the frame is somewhat compact, or if you have long feet, you may run into the problem of the back of your feet hitting the front of the bags while you pedal.

It should be high enough that if you place a heel on the low pedal your leg is almost fully extended (just short of locked). From there you can fiddle around a bit with the height. Ultimately the seat should be as high as you can get it without needing to rock your hips as you pedal. If your seat is too low climbing will be <strong>really</strong> hard!</p>

<p>If you're legs are burning, it's a good bet that you're not using a low enough gear. In this case, try shifting to a low gear <strong>much</strong> earlier in the climb, let your feet ""spin"" on the pedals. You'll slow down, but the climb should be much easier if you do this.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you're breathing super hard, you may be spinning too fast. It may seem counter-intuitive at first, but it may help to use a slightly higher gear, but I'd still make sure that you're starting the climb in a relatively easy gear.</p>

<p>As other's have said, I don't think it be too long before you notice that you are doing much better on the hill. I live in a relatively hilly part of the US and a similar situation to you. I was out of shape from years of sedentary work and infrequent riding. So the final things I want to suggest are ideas for keeping going until better fitness kicks in (I think we're talking weeks, not months):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pedaling faster (at a higher cadence) in a low gear is usually easier than pushing harder in a higher gear. There was a good answer a while back that explained nicely how to find a good cadence for you. I'll see if I can find it and link to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a strategy for the hill that seems to work for you (really any strategy, just some idea about what you want to try). Having a strategy will make it easier to see if you're making progress and it will also help you identify what to do differently if it feels too hard (e.g., legs really burning? try a lower gear). One idea I'd suggest is to try starting in a lowish, but not your lowest, gear – for me it is very comforting to know I've got a lower gear I can drop down to when the hill gets hard.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep track of your progress. Notice where you are on the hill when you ""bail out."" As you get close to that point on each ride psych yourself up to make it or even make it a bit farther. For me, it is easier to push through burning in my legs than through gasping for breath, so I tend to moderate my climbing so that I can breath easily and tough it out on my legs (but that is me, you might have a different way). The important thing is to have some standard for progress so that you can see you're gains – even before you can make the whole hill.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice standing as you climb, you might find it easier to climb standing. For me standing helps on some hills, but I have to start before my legs are too tired and my gear can't be too low. Standing is one of my ""escape hatches"" when I discover that I'm in too high a gear on a hill. Sometimes it is just fun, but not @andy256's comment below – it is not an efficient way to climb. The energy expenditure is actually higher than when spinning.</p></li>
<li><p>My understanding is that working really hard (too the point of exhaustion) a few times a week is necessary to stimulate muscle growth. I don't think you have to work hard for long (just a few minutes), but apparently it is essential.</p></li>

"Loose Handlebars","10287","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PHOZM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">I recently got into a small bike accident and the handlebars became loose. It seems to not be in sync with the front bike tire. I tried to tighten the headset and locknut, nothing seems to work. I can easily turn the handlebar into a new position with the tight bolts, which is the issue.
Is there any other possible ways to fix this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPdAc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>When you say out of sync I assume this means that when you look down while on the bike the handlebars point one direction and the wheel points in a slight different direction. </p>

<p>You say locknut so that implies a threaded headset. If so, simply loosen the bolt on the top of the stem and realign the stem with the front wheel while straddling the bike. Note this will also now allow the stem to lower down into the frame so be sure to first mark the height with a piece of tape. Threaded headsets are no longer the norm except on low end bikes and older bikes. Adjusting the lock nut and headset requires a pair of large open-ended wrenches. </p>

<p>If the stem has bolt on top (when you look down on it while riding) AND at the back of it. Then you have a threadless headset. These have been the norm on most bikes for the past ~25 years. The ""locknut"" you're referring to is the bolt on top of the stem (this bolt holds the fork/frame/stem/headset bearings together and keeps them properly compressed)***. If this is the case then all you need to do is loosen the bolt (or bolts - could be 2) which will allow you to swing the stem and bars left/right. Line the stem with with the front wheel while straddling the bike and then tighten the bolts. Take care not to over tighten the stem bolts! Don't go gorilla with the wrench (this rule applies to almost anything on a bike!) Given the safety repercussions of improperly adjusted stems it would be prudent to have a trained bike mechanic double check your work. </p>

<p>***If you did monkey with the top bolt you may have messed up the adjustment of your headset bearings. Don't panic, it's an easy fix:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loosen that top bolt however many turns you think you tightened it and maybe a few extra. Also loosen the bolt (or two) at the back of the stem.</li>
<li>Set the bike on the ground, stand next to it and turn the handlebars 90 degrees. Now squeeze and hold the front brake. Don't let go. </li>
<li>Try to roll the bike back and forth. You should feel a slight knocking sensation. This is play in the bearings (bad!)</li>
<li>Tighten the top bolt a half turn. Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3. </li>
<li>Repeat step 4 until the knocking sensation is gone. Key here is to adjust the top bolt in very small increments until the play/knocking is just removed. Any tighter and you'll create binding which will prematurely wear out the bearings. </li>
<li>Tighten the bolt or bolts at the rear of the stem. </li>
</ol>

"Can I use gear oil on my chain?","10273","","<p>I don't have any chain oil right now, but I have some gear oil left over from working on my car.  Would it be an effective chain lubricant?  It's listed as 80W90, but reading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_oil"">the Wikipedia article</a> suggests that that's not equivalent to motor oil viscosity ratings.</p>
","<p>Short answer: No, you shouldn't. Heavy oils attract too much dirt, grit and grime which will damage the useful life of your chain.</p>

<p>You need a light lubricant which will wick it's way into the internals of the chain, rather than simply coating the external portion of the chain.</p>

<p>A good Teflon carrier lube like the Finish Line Teflon works well, lasts a good while and doesn't pick up dirt when properly applied. Using something like that will extend the useful life of your chain.</p>

<p>Gear oil is too thick, and designed for a higher heat production than you get on a pedal driven bicycle. It relies on engine heat, and the gears moving at high speed to produce enough friction to reduce the viscosity of the oil enough to be thin enough to flow as a good lubricant. </p>

<p>It would be better than nothing, but hardly a good choice.</p>

"Why are BMX saddles so low?","10254","","<p>I've seen a lot of teenagers riding BMX bikes recently.</p>

<p>It seems that most if not all of the guys I've seen riding their BMX bikes around the streets, car parks, local parks, etc have a frame that's really small, and a saddle that's as low as possible.  It looks like the rider's knees are above their waists for much if not most of their stroke.</p>

<p>One of the local parks has a dedicated BMX track with actual racing taking place on it.  When I watch those guys they never seem to have their saddles all the way to the bottom.  </p>

<p>The thought occurred that it might have something to do with trick riding but none of the kids with bikes set up like this seemed to actually be doing tricks. They'd just be riding the bikes normally or even just sitting on them outside shops. Their bikes also didn't seem to be set up with trick riding in mind, most of them didn't have those bar things projecting from the wheel hubs for the riders to stand on.</p>

<p>Is this really low saddle something they're doing to be cool? Or are there some real tangible advantages to this seating position?</p>
","<p>Low seats provide clearance for more acrobatic body movements. This is essential for bunny hops and nearly every other trick which builds off of this skill. If you look at trials bikes they similarly have lots of clearance for the rider over the frame and the saddle. Since speeds are relatively low, and long distance riding is not the goal, pedaling efficiencies gained by a higher seat position are much less of a priority than vertical maneuverability. </p>

<p>As per Daniel R Hick's comment BMX bikes are also commonly used for children's bike's as they are easy to learn on because of the low seat. </p>

<p>In this case fashion follows function. Just because the particular riders you see aren't tricking doesn't mean there isn't a valid functional reason for this kind of setup. </p>

"Use a lock nut on a presta valve?","10245","","<p>I've always used a lock nut with a presta valve, but I know others who don't use it and leave the valve stem to protrude through the rim hole without fastening. </p>

<p>What, if any, are the advantages of not using a locking nut for a presta valve?</p>
","<p>The advantage is that it's quicker and easier to get the tube out and tyre off, and you never have to deal with jammed nuts. </p>

<p>IME the nut will be wedged unbelievably tight the one time you get a puncture at an inconvenient moment, and you'll end up breaking the valve (if you have pliers) or not being able to get at the hole (if you don't). The problem there is that you do the nut up firmly when the tube is inflated to 100psi, then it goes flat and without the air pressure ""firmly"" becomes ""OMG"".</p>

<p>The fix for that over-tight nut is obviously to inflate the tube. Which is fine if there's a wee hole somewhere away from the valve, but if the tube burst or you brought a spare tube instead of a patch kit you just have to somehow get the value out of the tyre. Which is surprisingly hard to do if the only tools you have to hand are whatever is on the side of the road.</p>

<p>Disadvantages of leaving it off: The nut is slightly useful if you have a flat-section rim drilled for Schrader values, in that it stops sand and muck getting in through the gap between the valve and the rim and rattling round in a hollow rim or causing punctures. Obviously this isn't an issue if your rim is drilled properly, and a better solution is to buy tubes with Schrader valves. </p>

<p>The nut can make putting a loose tyre back on by holding the bead in place by the valve while you try to balance the bead around the rim so it doesn't blow off. But a properly fitting tyre doesn't do that. And you could carry one nut in your repair kit, rather than one on each wheel (a saving of at least half a gram!)</p>

<p>(edit) the nut has to be tight enough that it doesn't loosen when the tube is fully inflated, but not so tight that it's hard to undo when the tube is flat. But often when you tighten it with the tube flat, when you pump it up the nut turns out to be loose. So to get it right you need to let the air out of the tube, tighten the nut some more, then pump it back up. Possibly more than once. Or you can tighten it once the tube is inflated and hope for the best. In which case you can easily end up back at the start of this answer.</p>

<p>The other 99% of the time the nut does nothing harmful. Nothing very useful either. It's just there.</p>

<p>(edit) Note that the question is not ""what are the advantages of using the nut"" or even ""how do you use the nut"", it is specifically ""advantages of <strong>not</strong> using the nut"". I don't think ""if you do this the nut works fine"" is an advantage of leaving the nut off.</p>

"Converting frame size to wheel size","10203","","<p>I've been trying to determine what size road or mountain bike I should purchase. All the charts I've found suggest what frame size I should have, but online shopping only lists wheel sizes. How do I determine what wheel size is best for my height?</p>
","<p>Generally, there are a few wheel sizes for adults on the market now:</p>

<ul>
<li>700c: This is the standard adult road bike wheel size. For mountain bikes, this is often sold as 29"" and is also the standard (where they're said to roll over bumps easier than a 26"" but at the cost of manuverability and weight). The rim diameter is 622 milimeters. </li>
<li>650b: This is becoming more popular with shorter riders for road and mountain biking (where its often sold as 27.5"", as a compromise between 26"" and 29""). It is smaller than 700c with a rim diameter of 584 millimeters. </li>
</ul>

<p>Less commonly, you'll find:</p>

<ul>
<li>26"": This was the old standard size for mountain bikes. The rim diameter is 559 mm. </li>
</ul>

<p>All these wheel sizes are available for a wide range of frame sizes (usually reported as some number of inches or centimeters, e.g. 58cm for a road bike or 23"" for a mountain bike, or small/medium/large/etc.). My guess is that you're reading the frame size and thinking it is the wheel size. </p>

<p>Note that frame sizes are not standardized between bike models or even related models (e.g. a bike that is sold in both a 26"" and 700c wheel version), so you need to try the bikes to see if they fit you well, and/or compare their geometries (e.g. standover height, top tube length, etc.). </p>

"Why don't Tour de France riders always ride their TT bikes?","10188","","<p>When the tour riders are doing time trials, they ride their super aerodynamic, aggressively positioned bikes for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>However, on normal stages, there are many cyclists who could also benefit from the greater aerodynamic efficiency. Any riders at the front of the peleton or any cyclists on the breakaway would gain a great deal from having their TT bikes.</p>

<p>I can't even think of any downsides, given that with electronic gears they can have duplicate shifter buttons on the aero bars and the bullhorns.</p>

<p>Why don't they use their TT bikes all the time?</p>
","<p>There are 2 good reasons for this. </p>

<p>First, a TT bike is the most efficient machine for flat, fast course racing, where there are a minimum of hills. It is not the most efficient machine when it comes to climbing. The body position is far too aggressive for even professional athletes to use in a non-TT style event. A bike with more a more upright body position, a more stable weight distribution, a lighter frame, and far, far lighter wheels, is a more efficient choice for that style of ride.</p>

<p>Secondly, a TT bike sacrifices bike handling for that extreme power and aero efficiency. The TT stages are controlled events, where there are either one rider, or one team on the course at a time, and so limitations on stability and handling are acceptable. Take the same bike in a 150 rider peloton, where riders constantly jockey for position, and where even on a stable bike losing focus for 1 second can cause a major crash, and all of a sudden, those same sacrifices in bike handling and stability are no longer a benefit for the rider or the team. They become a hazard to the team's chances of winning. And not just for the stage or the day, since a bad crash can take a rider out for the season. Or God forbid, permanently. </p>

<p>For these reasons, the UCI has seen fit to ban the bikes in non-TT events, in order to ensure rider safety. And for once, their decision makes sense.</p>

"Reducing saddle bounce when increasing cadence","10137","","<p>Trying up my cadence, but noticing a fair bit of saddle bounce.</p>

<p>Few things that could be contributing.</p>

<ul>
<li>I use toeclips over cleats</li>
<li>saddle height (thou I'm at the sweet spot of full leg extension without strain)</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any techniques/exercises to reduce this or am I simply trying to increase my cadence too fast too soon?</p>
","<p>I think the most useful measure would be to improve your spinning technique, by spinning itself.</p>

<p>That would require a lot of self-observation, and a lot of self-discipline, in order to perceive in which conditions the pogo-effect manifests itself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which cadence;</li>
<li>Which power-output;</li>
<li>Which pedal/leg position cause the ""jerk"" and the bouncing.</li>
</ul>

<p>A nice way to do that without too much rocket science is to add some cushioning to your ride for some time, be it baloon tires, suspension fork, suspension post, soft-sprung saddle, and the like. Train with one of these for a while, until you're satisfied. I think suspension-seatpost is the most direct and cost-effective choice for this case.</p>

<p>With one of these ""devices"", the bouncing effect would be increased a lot, and you will be forced to discipline your rhythm so that the bouncing stops or at least gets diminished.</p>

<p>I had a lot of unintentional training with that during my mountain-bike years, in a time suspension forks didn't have lockout systems. I think it worked fine, and if you do it consciously, perhaps it works even better.</p>

Thule seem to be selling rebadged Freeload gear? I have seen a Thule rack fail with significantly less than 25kg on it, and while being ridden fairly gently (very gently by full suspension MTB standards - think hiking track rather than singletrack), when the rider twisted the bike from side to side. None of the solutions of full suspension bikes are robust enough for harder mountain bike routes, and none will carry their full weight rating without really affecting the bike's handling.</p>

<p>The reason for that is that full suspension frames and components are not designed to take the extra force of the load, and often not designed to take much force at all where the racks attach. Ideally the rack will attach to a point that's designed to take a load but isn't being used for that load - V brake posts on a bike with disk brakes, for example. But regardless, if you have a lightweight bike and you load it up and ride it hard, something will break.</p>

<p>If you look at designed-for-touring bikes they usually have heavy frames, built in points to attach racks, and are sold with heavy wheels and beefed up components. At least compared to a fun bike or racing bike, which is what most full suspension bikes are. There are full suspension touring bikes, like the Bike Friday, but they are built very differently to mountain bikes.</p>

<p>The usual compromise is a hardtail - that gives you a solid place to attach a rear rack while getting some benefit from the front suspension.</p>

<p>How much gear you carry depends on what you mean by touring. To some people touring is accompanying a tour bus and support crew on short daily rides, to others it's riding the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning_Stock_Route"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canning Stock Route</a> without a support vehicle. In many ways your weight budget will determine where you can go along that spectrum. You can also spend your way out of some of the problems by using ultra-light hiking gear to cut the weight you're carrying. As an example, I normally carry about 20kg of gear on month-plus tours, then another 10kg-20kg of food and water. For a weekend I'd not take cooking gear and minimise everything else to take about 15kg total assuming there's water en route, but that means accepting that if it rains I sleep in wet polypro and if we're delayed a day I go hungry (ie, trading weight for risk). </p>

<p>I suggest looking at <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/14142/going-on-a-long-distance-bike-tour-what-kit-do-i-need"">some of</a> the <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10143/are-bicycle-rear-racks-and-panniers-suitable-for-cross-country-riding"">touring questions</a> to get an idea of what exactly you want to do and what gear you're likely to need to do it.</p>

<p>Note on risk: if you're touring off road you need to keep an eye on your escape routes. Specifically, remember that you go much faster riding than you do carrying a broken mountain bike. If you break the bike late on the first day of a two day ride you might have to spend three days walking out (assuming you're unhurt). On-road touring is usually less risky because you can flag down a passing motorist and get a ride (or call a taxi).</p>

","<p>I don't think you have a problem here. Physiologically, your thighs are the engine room of your legs. They are designed for endurance and power and can keep working at a high output for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>Your calves are more for short bursts of power, such as jumping or sprinting. They can't sustain high power output for any length of time. In distance cycling, your calves should be fairly passive. Attempting to work them harder will probably just result in fatigue and injuries.</p>

"Always cycling in highest gear, why?","9879","","<p>For all my life I have noticed that I always cycle in the highest gear (most of my bikes had at least 3x7, so it wasn't a lack of options) whilst most serious cyclists cycle on relatively low gears and are spinning like crazy from my perspective. Now, I get that taste definitely plays a role in these kind of things, but what I would love to know is whether serious cyclists learn to cycle in lower gear consciously or whether ""it's just me"" that loves cycling in a style where I move my legs as little as possible.</p>

<p>I realize this question is fairly broad and I hope the answer is fairly clear cut, but just to be fair it could theoretically be split up in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there something bad about a cycling style in relatively higher gears?</li>
<li>What causes such a cycling style in the first place?</li>
</ul>

<p>But I will keep it as a single question as those things are I believe extremely closely related.</p>
","<p>Left to their own devices many will cycle at a cadence (a measure of how fast you spin) that approximates cadence of walking, an RPM of about 50-60.  So the fact you prefer a slower leg speed is not unusual. Trained cyclists will often have a cadence between 80-110 and up to 200 for sprints (track).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there something bad about a cycling style in relatively higher
  gears?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, many believe that pedaling at too high of a gear and too low of a cadence can cause more muscular and ligament stress.  Whether or not this bears out in terms of experimental evidence I am not sure (<strong>does anyone know of some experimental evidence?</strong>).  </p>

<p>A confounding factor on this is an individuals neuromuscular responses (i.e., how well they fire their muscles for the activity of pedaling in circles).  People that are not ""good"" at pedaling will often pedal more slowly and their inefficient pedaling patterns may also be responsible for higher muscular and ligament stress.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What causes such a cycling style in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, a faster cadence has been born from performance considerations. Cycling is not a natural activity.  It is an activity we invented that co-ops a lot of our mechanical and neurological pathways used for walking (e.g., corrective steering, steering into a fall, is very similar to walking when you step in the direction you are falling).  As such we need to train our <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34038"">neuromuscular</a> responses to be more tailored to an activity like cycling.  Everyone who spins fast specifically trained to do so.  Most who train and cycle lots prefer to spin faster.  That said, there are some trained athletes who pedal relatively slower (although likely still faster than a non-cyclist). </p>

<p>In terms of an ""optimal"" cadence there is still a lot of debate (e.g., <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17461390802684325"">Ansley and Cangley 2009</a>) as it depends on what you are optimizing for (energetic costs, muscular stress, perception of effort, peak power).</p>

<p>Most will optimize based on perception of effort.  If you have not trained your neuromuscular pathways for the cycling motion it will be less developed and a slower cadence will likely feel more optimal.  As you ride more and your neuromuscular pathways become more efficient (i.e., you are better at recruiting muscles for the pedaling action) and a faster cadence will likely feel more ""efficient.""  </p>

<p>Of course this is a somewhat anecdotal assertion. I haven't personally run experiments tracking peoples progression from non-cyclists to cyclists. I have however accumulated years of observations from running cycling clubs. And as always there is lots of individual variation and the possibility of exceptions.  </p>

<p>In the end it is best to pay attention to your body and choose a pedaling speed that bio-mechanically work the best for you. </p>

"Is it harmful for a hydraulic brakes bike to be put upside down","9862","","<p>I heard somewhere that bikes with hydraulic brakes should not be put upside down. If they are, 15 minutes should be allowed, before the bike is used.</p>

<p>Is there any truth in this? What process could be happening.</p>

<p>I am asking this, because I sometimes leave my bike upside-down overnight, to remove any water from inside the frame. Today I noticed some oil on the inside of the lever of my BR-M445L.</p>
","<p>There are two risks to turning your hydraulic brakes upside-down.</p>

<p>The brake system isn't filled to overflowing with hydraulic fluid: there's likely to be a small air bubble. Normally, this sits at the highest point of the system: the oil reservoir at the brake lever. There, it's not compressed by the piston when you brake, so it can't interfere with braking. If you up-end your bike, air bubbles might travel through the system to the brake pads. If they don't manage to make it back up to the reservoir before you want to brake, you might find your brakes are squishier than usual. 15 minutes is perhaps a pessimistic estimate, and it's not that much of a risk unless you get on your bike and right away need to brake very hard.</p>

<p>The other potential problem is if the seals in the oil reservoir aren't quite tight. You might not notice in normal use, because they're at the top, but when they're at the bottom of the system, the pressure might let some brake fluid seep out. If you notice this happening, stop turning your bike upside-down, and make sure to check that you still have enough fluid to brake properly. If it keeps happening after you've re-tightened the seal, you may need to change the rubber grommet(s). Often rubber seals are dissolved over time by the oil, and stop doing their job properly.</p>

<p>As others have said in the comments, you'd be better off avoiding the need to turn your bike upside-down. Find where the water is getting into the frame and seal any gaps. Some bikes already come with holes in the bottom in case they need to drain, and you might consider adding your own.</p>

","<p>The answer is in the question - freewheel, not freehub or cassette. You will be needing the tool and a vice (or huge adjustable spanner).</p>

<p>Remember to put the skewer or wheel nuts loosely on to hold the removal tool in place whilst you give it the initial heave-ho. Thereafter take the skewer/nut off.</p>

<p>If you don't want to do it/fork out for the tool then ask your friendly local bike shop - it is a given that they will have the tool. Go with your big adjustable spanner and borrow the tool for five minutes (remembering to buy something) if they insist on charging you £10 for the job.</p>

"Bottle dynamo vs. hub dynamo","9834","","<p>I have SpinPOWER USB charger kit, and I am using a bottle dynamo with it. I have heard that the power output from a hub dynamo is higher than from a bottle dynamo. Does anyone have any information about the merits of using hub dynamo vs. bottle dynamo? Also, what is a good hub dynamo, and what is a price range for the installation?</p>
","<p>I have not used a bottle dynamo for a very long time, but have a hub dynamo. Broadly, the hub dynamos are more expensive but more efficient - you get less drag for the same power output. Most systems put out 3W peak power for historical reasons, although a lot of new lights use less than this. Bottle dynamos are noisier and wear on your tyre, which may be an issue if your tyres otherwise last a long time. A good bottle dyno will be nearly as efficient as a hub dyno and cost about half as much, plus you don't have to build it into the wheel. A cheap bottle dyno should be removed and thrown away.</p>

<p>Some dynamos will put out more than 6V, which is how you can get more power out of them (the Schmidt ones do - I used to run a 5W white LED straight off one). Often at decent speed they will go to 12V at the same 500mA, so you can get 6W. There are also <a href=""http://www.pedalpower.com.au/"">dynamos specifically designed to do this</a>, and they usually come with a regulator and various output options for charging things like phones.</p>

<p>Hub dynamo systems cost at least a couple of hundred dollars because you need to build the dynamo into a wheel. But they last a long time (I don't know how long as I've only had mine for 10 years and the ones I know of that have failed have done so when the bike was destroyed around them, or the owner pulled them apart). Any decent LBS should be able to get them if they don't stock them, or refer you to one who does. <a href=""http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/lightingsystems.htm"">Peter White Cycles</a> is one of the better dealers in the US with a wide range of options, likewise <a href=""http://www.stkildacycles.com.au/parts-and-accessories/schmidt-hub-dynamos?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=62"">St Kilda Cycles</a> in Australia. </p>

<p>What strategies/options are there for reducing the interference outside of repositioning the computer (since I've tried all available positions)?</p>
","<p>Because the items are going to have to remain in close proximity, it's unlikely that there is anything that will completely solve your problem, but there are a couple of things you can try.</p>

<p>If the lights are wired, it is possible that the wire is working as an antenna, and you can use a Ferrite Choke or two on the wire.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qyrl2.jpg"" alt=""ferrite choke""></p>

<p>Tape one near where the wire leaves the battery, and another to where the wire lead plugs into the light.  The can be found at stores like <a href=""http://www.radioshack.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&amp;kw=ferrite&amp;origkw=ferrite&amp;sr=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RadioShack</a> for a few bucks.</p>

<p>If the lights are wireless, aluminum and tin foil is an excellent reflector for this kind of Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI).</p>

<p>The first step would be to see if foil will help.  Try wrapping the outside of the lights with foil and repeating the tests you did before.  I doubt you can add foil to the computer because this will interfere with it picking up the wireless signal from the sensors.</p>

<p>If that reduces the interference you can tape the foil to the lights, carefully cutting away the foil around mounting brackets and buttons and see if the EMI is still reduced.  If the lights can be easily disassembled you can try taking them apart and lining the interior with foil as well; take care not to short out the internal electronics. </p>

"Where to mount a headlight if the handlebar is obscured by a basket","9804","","<p>I have a permanently mounted basket in front of the handlebars (because I have a child seat on the rack in the back).

","<p>As a rather quick solution and possible permanent fix if the look suits you, you could get a piece of plastic PVC pipe just long enough and the approximate diameter of your handlebars, and just affix the plastic PVC pipe to the front of the basket, and mount the light on the PVC tube. If the basket is the wire type, you could slot the bottom of the pipe an it would slip right over the top of the basket and then the clamp for the light could run through the wire and around the light to secure it. This same thing could likely be accomplished with other types of baskets as long as there was a good support at the top of the basket.

I've gone through a lot of pads on that rotor (like 20-30 pairs). And only when I could actually feel with my fingers the groove on the surface, I replaced it. Also it started eating pads like mad - uneven breaking surface wore pads much quicker.</p>

<p>I'd say rotors is something you would not replace quite often. And rotors would not fail on you like a worn-out rims - rotors won't split easily. So for a sake of measurements, 30% thickness reduction would be a good indication to replace the poor thing.</p>

Is this as easy as adding 20mm to the height of the front end, or does the ""height"" vary by make and model?  Thanks.</p>
","<p>Since the headtube is at an angle, it will not raise the bike as much as if it was perpendicular to the ground.  How much height that would add will depend on what angle your headtube is at, probably something around 70d.</p>

<p>Now, adding travel will cause your bike to have slower handling.  It will make it more stable in a straight line, but more effort will be needed to change direction.  It will also move you farther back in the cockpit with may make it lift the front wheel more on steep climbs.</p>

<p>Also, by adding this travel, it will probably void the warranty on your frame because it is putting stresses on the frame that are outside what it was designed for.  There is also a possibility that you could stress the headtube to where it breaks, but 20mm probably wouldn't do it.</p>

","<p>I find that a standers, one-legged kickstand doesn't work well with a full touring load (as you've found). I used a two-legged stand mounted to the frame just behind the <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/2759#2759"">bottom bracket</a>, and while that worked well, it scraped up the frame where the kickstand was mounted. </p>

<p>Touring without a kickstand was my solution for quite some time, until I found the click-stand. It's a kickstand substitute, essentially a modified tent pole with a cradle on the end. It's custom sized by the manufacturer so it'll fit with your bike. It's particularly well-suited to loaded touring bikes, and is much more stable than traditional kickstands. However, It takes a little time to deploy, and I'm not sure it'd work reliably with a load of loose items such as groceries unless they're very tightly packed. (More information, including pictures <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/573/whats-your-most-useful-cycle-accessory/584#584"">here</a>.) </p>

<p>However, none of these will let you spin the pedals while the stand is down, unless you have very long chainstays; as far as I know, most bikes, except for cruisers, do not. A kickstand mounted to the rear triangle, just in front of the rear axle, <em>will</em> allow you to spin the wheels while the bike is parked, if you balance the bike on the front wheel and the rear, deployed kickstand. The Greenfield stabilizer kickstand has a good reputation in the touring community. We have one on one of our bikes, a Trek Navigator. It seems stable, but we haven't brought that bike on tour just yet. (With the Greenfield on the bike, I was able to balance the bike with panniers on it, so it looks good.) </p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: If your frame is particularly sturdy and you're not worried about scratching it, a two-legged kickstand on the chainstays behind the bottom bracket will work best. If this is not the case, a kickstand on the rear triangle would work well for you. </p>

<p>For those of you that have experience installing these: Have you used one of these hubs and did you go through the process of sourcing, fitting and adjusting this hub yourself? What did you improvise/overcome/improve during your fitting? When done did you feel you had done it perfectly? Compare the complexity of this task (Alfine system and adjustment) to a conventional derailleur...</p>

<p>edit: if what you are looking for is a grease-free solution for your belt-drive bike, these are not questions you should be asking. Alfie 11 hubs leak oil and make your belt just as greasy as a chain. I'm hearing from many people ""mine too"". One store tells me the extra tension on the sprocket when using a belt with this hub makes leaks all but inevitable. Shimano have had mine twice for extended periods for service and can't fix it. I am massively disappointed in this product, wish I had bought the 8-speed that uses grease rather than oil bath internally. </p>
","<p>With the bike linked, I don't think this hub can be fitted properly. </p>

<p>It requires a method to adjust the chain tension, and this frame has neither the eccentric bottom bracket recommended, nor a horizontal dropout which could allow the adjustment.</p>

<p>It is possible you could run it with V-brakes, and something like a <a href=""http://surlybikes.com/parts/singleator/"" rel=""nofollow"">Surly Singleator</a>. It just isn't something I'd trust under that kind of load.</p>

<p>The hub is intended for a disc brake, and that frame is not set up for that.</p>

<p>While you could mount a coaster or drum brake, attaching it to a carbon fiber chain stay, which was not engineered with force from a coaster brake clamp in mind seems to be a possibly unhealthy option.</p>

<p>With the right rim, you could still use V-brakes, but how would you tension the chain? I've used various dropout based chain tensioners, and they function on a straight single speed hub, as long as you keep them adjusted, but throwing in the stress and multi-directional forces from shifting, and I don't think it would stay tensioned for very long.</p>

<p>Building the wheel is a worthwhile job, and the  install on a proper horizontal dropout frame is fairly simple with the 8 speed version, and this looks to be set up the same. </p>

<p>But I wouldn't choose to run it on that frame.</p>

"Where can I find replacement pads for a bicycle helmet?","9610","","<p>I have a Bell bicycle helmet that is probably two years old, and the pads for the front and sides have disintegrated from sweat and are now little more than pieces of fabric attached to the velcro pads inside the helmet.  Does anyone know where I can get replacement pads for the helmet?  I have looked on retail sites like jensonusa.com and on the bellhelmets.com site and I can't seem to find them.</p>
","<p>Here is the list of Bell helmet spares available in the UK:</p>

<p>If your helmet is on there then you can find the product code and Google that for someone online that has that part in stock and can sell it to you. Note that Madison is the UK distributor and has different product codes to elsewhere, so a google of the exact product description might come up good.</p>

<p>Once you know the product code then your LBS should have no problems ordering it for you. Note that helmets change every 2-3 years and you may not be able to get spares for an older model.</p>

<p>Another option is to treat yourself to a new and affordable helmet, this will come with spare pads that you can use on your existing one. Affordable ones have a lot going for them and they still have to pass the same tests as the posh ones.</p>

<p>IMHO the Bell helmets are very poorly designed bits of cheap Chinese polystyrene with straps and fit that are not a patch on the European makes, e.g. MET helmets. the MET helmets have straps where the adjustment buckles don't want to align 90 degrees to your skin (to dig in), a clasp that doesn't catch the skin under the chin or straps that need tightening every time you put the thing on. Then there are the Specialized helmets - to the higher Snell standard than the CPSC 'as tested by the manufacturer' standard used by Bell/Giro (did you know they were the same company?). Of course you could also go 'completely Dutch' and forego the 'nice hat' entirely.</p>

<p>Anyway, if the LBS is useless, consider the 'order by part number' route or get a replacement helmet which will come with enough spare pads for your existing one.</p>

"What belt-drive compatible frame and belt-drive kit would you recommend?","9594","","<p>I would like to build a custom belt-drive bike for my daily commute. I am looking for a frame and a belt-drive kit for a total budget of about 500$.</p>

<p>I ride all year long, and winters here (Montreal, Canada) are pretty hard on bikes, so I need a simple yet robust frame. Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>You may be a bit out of luck with that price range if you hope to get the whole kit.  The Gates belt, cog, and ""chain""-ring retail online for over $200 by themselves.</p>

<p>That said, there are some options if you are clever and dedicated. If you're able to find one of the old 90's mountain bikes with <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=elevated+chainstay"" rel=""nofollow"">elevated chainstays</a> you can use one of the expensive ($125-$150) eccentric bottom brackets that mount in a normal 68mm shell for tension.  A 90's Nishiki should be fairly cheap, so you'd eke in just under your total price.  It's also fair to say that your bike would be a unique build.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have access to an affordable machinist, start with an inexpensive frame that has thick track-style dropouts. Modifying them into a variant of the <A href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/singlespeedmaniac/2826348686/"" rel=""nofollow"">old Spot-style</a> dropouts should be relatively easy with a dremel, some taps, and a skilled hand. This avoids the significant cost of the S&amp;S couplers used by most belt-drive modifications.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, unless the frame was purpose-built for a belt, you're going to be stuck modifying it. There are few, if-any, belt-specific frames in the market now, which keeps prices high.  The proper modifications either require an expensive S&amp;S coupler or new dropouts, which are expensive to add aftermarket.</p>

","<p>Front and rear derailers are essentially independent -- so long as the two derailers can function with the same type chain they can work together.</p>

<p>Derailer ""fit"" basically involves 4 factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of chain that can be ""absorbed"" by the arm (rear derailer only)</li>
<li>The index ""pitch"" of the derailer &amp; its shift lever -- how far it moves in one step (indexed derailers only)</li>
<li>The total distance the derailer can move in and out (adjustable to a degree)</li>
<li>The angle that the derailer describes as it moves in and out</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of chain that the rear derailer arm can ""absorb"" between the most extended chain position and the most ""relaxed"" is generally specified as a number of teeth, being the difference between the sum of the teeth on the largest front and rear sprockets and the sum of the teeth on the smallest front and rear sprockets.</p>

<p>A sprocket cluster has a number of sprockets joined together with a certain ""pitch"" -- the distance between sprockets, as measured from (to pick one point) the outermost surface of one sprocket to the outermost surface of the next sprocket.  The ""pitch"" of the derailer/shift lever must match this sprocket cluster pitch or the derailer will never be able to be adjusted to shift between sprockets.</p>

<p>The total distance the derailer must be able to move is the index pitch times one less than the number of sprockets in the cluster.  Eg, for 5 sprocket cluster with a 5mm pitch the derailer must move 20mm from innermost to outermost.  Note that most derailers can be adjusted with the high and low limits to 2 or 3 different numbers of sprockets.</p>

<p>The angle is a little more complicated, and also not always well documented for different derailers.  The rear cluster on a mountain or touring bike generally has a wide range of sprocket sizes and hence the angle that the derailer movement must describe relative to the axle is fairly steep.  A racing cluster, on the other hand, would tend to have sprocket sizes very close together (only one tooth difference in the extreme case), and so the angle relative to the axle is fairly shallow.  Derailer specifications may state this quantity as a range of sprocket sizes, or a range of teeth (or may omit it entirely). </p>

<p>(Obviously, ""angle"" is also an issue for front derailers, and here the acceptable sprocket sizes should be clearly spelled out.  Your standard front derailer may not handle that super-small granny gear, for instance.)</p>

<p>Most 9-speed derailers can be adjusted to work with an 8-speed cluster, so long as the 8-speed cluster is using the 9-speed pitch.  Unfortunately, the pitch of 8-speed clusters is not cast in concrete, but in most cases it's the same as 9-speed.</p>

"How difficult is the switch from flat to drop bar?","9539","","<p>I've ridden with flat bars for more than 10 years, both freeride and commuting. Now I'm considering switching to a road bike with a drop bar for commuting.</p>

<p>As far as get used to it just ride. Brakes and gears are different but clearly you have figured that out.  More hand position.  Most riding is up on the brakes/hoods.  If you get on the bike and go straight down in the drops it will feel low - that is for high speed and into the wind.</p>

"Why is BMX gearing so low","9489","","<p>I was watching the BMX racing on the 2012 Olympics and the gearing seems incredibly low. About half way down the start ramp they are already going too fast to keep pedalling and they barely seem to be able to pedal effectively any other time through the race.</p>

<p>Why don't they adjust the gearing to be higher so they can get more power down through the course?</p>
","<p>The tracks do not have many long stretches and so cornering and getting ahead of the pack is a lot more important than going fast in the flats. The gearing on a race BMX is higher than on one you will buy out of the store. Most BMX will come with 44:16 gear ratio where racers will use 46-48:16, and I have seen higher. (There are different rear sizes but the standard is 16 when talking about <a href=""http://www.bmxmadness.com/bmx_gear_ratio_sizing_charts.htm"">Gear Ratios</a>, even if you ride 9t or 14t rear you almost always know the conversion to 16t.)</p>

<p>Most racers will start with 44/45:16 then move up when they build their leg muscles to handle the higher ratios, but even then you really need that hole-shot a lot more than you need the higher end speed.</p>

<p>If the tracks had longer straights like a mountain bike course you might see more bikes with multiple gears and even higher gearing. As it stands, the berms are where you make your moves and getting in and out of the berms require more power than raw speed. I raced 44:16 against guys with 46:16 and never placed lower than 3rd. You want more power than over all speed on a race track.</p>

<p>On street or in park you want even lower gearing, especially when you are trying to get that last pop before jumping up onto a rail.</p>

"How do I tell the size of my braking discs?","9485","","<p>Looking to replace my hydraulic disc brakes but intend to use the old discs. How do I tell the size of the discs to ensure I purchase the right brakes?</p>
","<p>The disc that you are talking about is in fact called the rotor.</p>

<p>Rotor size is measured by diameter, ie. edge to edge through the centre. The size may also be etched on to the rotor which would be more accurate than measuring yourself. There are a number of common IS (International Standard) sizes of rotor from 140mm through to 203mm.</p>

<p>Callipers only come in one size but use various adapters/spacers to fit the rotor. Once you know what rotor you have you purchase a new brake set which may or may not include the adapter you need. Your current brake callipers would use the right size adapter for the rotor you are using, but may not be right for the brake you wish to purchase, companies have proprietary systems for attaching the calliper such as Avid's CPS which require special adapters or spacers.</p>

<p>Additionally there are two types of mounts for callipers post and IS. Most callipers are made to use post mounts while most frames still have IS mounts on the real dropout. An IS mount is like a fin with two holes in it while a post mount is two posts. IS adapters are used to allow the calliper to be fastened to the bike. Most recent forks are post mount.</p>

","<p>If you are running V-brakes then you will need to make sure your second set of wheels have the same rim width as your existing set. Otherwise the brakes may not line up properly.</p>

<p>Your complete shopping list:</p>

<ul>

<li>Cassette</li>
<li>Spoke Protector (highly optional!)</li>
<li>Rim tape x 2</li>
<li>Tubes x 2</li>
<li>Tyres x 2</li>
</ul>

<p>When swapping the wheels over the gears should not need re-adjusting each time. You can also go for a different range, e.g. smaller closer ratio more suited to the commute. Your existing wide-ratio chain length should work fine. Depending on the level of wear of the chain you may want to get one of those too. You can check how far the chain has 'stretched' by putting it on the outer chainring and then pulling it at the point nearest the front. If this pulls forward 5mm or more then it is worn. This is a rule of thumb, you can get the posh tool for measuring chain wear or measure it with a ruler.</p>

<p>The other main benefit of two wheel sets is that you can service one set properly without being bereft of your bike. Not many people do it for mountain bikes, road bike owners tend to do this more in practice. The crucial thing to get right is the rim width, if your bike is a recent model then you can sometimes get replacement wheels from that bike manufacturer rather than have to get something specifically built up. Obviously if you are running disks then any wheels will do.</p>

"Sora front derailleur set up","9379","","<p>I'm trying to get my front derailleur to stop rubbing in the high gears, smallest sprockets. To do this I am attempting to follow this guide by shimano:</p>

<p>It says that when in the largest chainring it should be possible to adjust the derailleur so that it is 0-0.5mm aways from the largest chainring on the side furthest away from the bike. This however is not possible and seems to have been set by the lbs simply by putting the cable at very high tension to push it over so it doesn't rub. I believe this may be slipping or stretching and causing the rub to return.</p>

<p>What's the correct way to do this? Is this normal or is the derailleur being dysfunctional?</p>
","<p>Wow what a horrible guide.</p>

<p>Tightening the gear cable while in the highest front gear is very tough and will only hurt your fingers. I recommend putting the front dérailleur into the lowest gear and tightening it that way. This is much easier!</p>

<p>As for your specific problem, in all my experience you can never not get 'rubbing' (if by rubbing you mean the chain running through the dérailleur over hang and brushing it). 
However, you will notice that the brushing varies depending on whether the back gears are high or low. Since this varies the angle at which the chain 'points' to the back gears.</p>

<p>So the solution:
Since you will always have brushing (a tiny bit at least), you just seek to minimise it. Put the back gears in the most used gear <strong>before</strong> tuning the front dérailleur.
For example on my touring bike I'm usually in my third highest gear at the back, unless going up hills or firing down them. So I tighten my front dérailleur cable while the back gear is as such, this means I only get front gear rubbing when the back gear is perhaps in the very low gears, thus causing the chain to 'go backwards' at a different angle.</p>

<p>If you want to spend a ridiculous ton of money on a fancy dérailleur you can mitigate this, but there's really no need.
For mountain bikes the most common gear back gear is the lower one. If you're not sure which  you've used most, clean the cassette of a bike you've used well, and look at the wear on each  cog.</p>

<p>What equipment should I buy then, to commute 11 miles each way through a city (Toronto) on  flat, paved roads, shared with cars:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wheels?</li>
<li>Tyres?</li>
<li>Clipless pedals and shoes?</li>
<li>Gears?</li>
<li>Handlebars (e.g. flat or dropped)?</li>
<li>Frame (size, shape, material)?</li>
<li>Mud-guard/fender?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Here I'll summarize everyone else's answers (because of all the Q+A scattered through in the comments), with some additional information that I got elsewhere from reading inspired by people's answers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wheels+tires: 700 x (28 - 38, maybe ~30), tires; slicks or light treads, not knobbly. The larger wheel makes it faster (because of 'gearing') and the ride a little smoother (because of the 'angle of incidence' when rolling over an obstacle). Possibly puncture-resistant tires, especially if you experience many puntures. Reinflate them weekly. With the narrower tires, beware storm drains, streetcar tracks, dirt roads, and cornering especially fast and on wet roads.</p></li>
<li><p>Clipless pedals and shoes: up to 35%-50% more efficient than without, but practice with them for 1/2 day to 2 weeks away from traffic first, because you must expect to fall off (everyone does). The normal type of clipless, for commuting, would be SPD: SPD are not impossible to walk in (unlike some other types). The stiffer the sole of the shoe, the better it distributes force over the whole sole of your foot. {Prefer a system which lets you clip onto either side of each pedal?}</p></li>
<li><p>Gears: multi-speed (e.g. 7, 8, or even 14-speed) <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/1728#1728"">internal-hub gears</a> cost $300+ (which is more than derailleurs), and tend to exist only on more expensive (above $1000) bikes; internal-hub gears means lower maintenance, chain is less likely to fall off, easier to have a chain guard even, and you can change gears while stopped, maybe 2% less efficient that derailleurs, and takes a different kind of chain. Derailleurs are more common. A 2-position rather than 3-position derailleur on the front would be adequate if there are no hills.</p></li>
<li><p>Handlebars: as you wish (however, many/most people recommend flat instead of dropped); at commuting speeds it's more a matter of comfort than aerodynamics (and a more upright position is deemed more comfortable). Dropped affords more wrist positions; you can ask for interrupter levers on dropped handlebars, to access the brakes from more than one hand position/location.</p></li>
<li><p>Brakes: disc brakes work better or more reliably than rim brakes, especially when the road is wet (or the wheel isn't true); and if you go downhill at 70 kph you might want hydraulic disc and not just mechanical disk brakes (hydraulics are more expensive, are difficult or impossible to self-maintain, require less or no maintenance or routine cable adjustments, and require less finger-force to actuate).</p></li>
<li><p>Frame: not too important i.e. no-one offered advice on that; as long as (for speed) it's not a mountain bike, especially not a bike with suspension (suspension is inefficient). Aluminium isn't lighter than steel, because it's not as strong (and therefore there needs to be more of it). Aluminium is stiffer than equivalent steel, so (for comfort) higher-end bikes add (more expensive) carbon forks and/or seat posts to aluminium. Aluminium won't rust.</p></li>
<li><p>Other equipment: lights; fenders/mudguards; rack and/or saddlebag and/or panniers; bike lock[s] (maybe one chain and one U-lock: not a cable, which is easy to snip); maybe mirrors (you can/should shoulder-check as well, but many/most urban bike accidents happen while the rider isn't looking ahead); maybe a trip computer; a tire pump, able to inflate to about 110 psi (so not just a little hand-pump); bus fare (in case of a flat or irreparable tire, or horrific weather).</p></li>
<li><p>Store: find a ""good"" Local Bike Store (LBS), where you can meet the mechanics (a ""good LBS for commuting"" isn't necessarily the same as ""good for road-racing"" or ""good for MTB""). Pretty much any decent LBS will allow ~30 minute ride: take a few for a test-ride, before you buy, to <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2795"">see which one feels right</a>. Furthermore, expect to pay <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2781/how-much-maintenance/2783#2783"">at least $600/year in maintenance costs</a> (as much or more than the cost of buying the bike), visiting the shop at least 3 times/year: which is another reason why it's important to find a ""good"" LBS.</p></li>
<li><p>Speed: expect to average 20 kph at most, in the city, when there are stops and lights etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: a decent $700 (including brakes and gears but perhaps excluding 'extras' like lights) bike from a good store should be ""great"" (but it won't have internal-hub gears, nor hydraulic disk brakes, nor any carbon components)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional comments or advice will be welcome.</p>

"Would a military helmet make a safe alternative to a bicycle helmet?","9354","","<p>I am in need of a new bicycle helmet and have been exploring some alternative options. One possibility I am considering is visiting my local Army Surplus store and getting a helmet there. I only use my bike for commuting, 3-4 miles in a single trip, tops. So the weight or lack of ventilation won't be a problem for me. Additionally, having a helmet durable enough to not need replacing after a minor bump or contact with the ground seems appealing (and cost-effective).
Right now, I am thinking something along the lines of a vintage WWII helmet.</p>

<p>So my question is would this be a viable and safe option for me or do I need some sense slapped in to me? I figure if it's meant to deflect bullets or shrapnel, then it should work fine for a fall or if I get hit by a car.</p>

<p>Obviously, I'll have look into the <em>legality</em> of this for my state on my own. But I am wondering if anyone out there has any experience or advice for me on this topic.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Bicycle helmets contain crushable foam that works to <a href=""http://www.bhsi.org/general.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">extend the duration of impact by about 6 ms</a> (milliseconds).   This doesn't make the impact force disappear, instead it extends the duration of force experienced by the brain.  By extending the duration, you reduce the peak force.  The brain can withstand impacts to some degree, however if the impact is too forceful over too short a period of time (like your head hitting asphalt), the peak force experienced by your brain becomes too high resulting in brain damage or even death.  While 6 ms may seem  small, it can be enough to reduce the peak force experience from lethal and/or damaging to survivable and/or reduced damage (see Figure 1).</p>

<br><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>.  Impact force by time a brain sees with a helmet (A) and without a helmet (B).  The total energy is the same (area under the curve), but the peak force is lower for the brain with a helmet.</em>  <br>(Source: <a href=""http://www.bhsi.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.bhsi.org/</a>)</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Combat_Helmet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Modern military helmet</a> are designed to protect against things like shrapnel, not absorb impacts (although <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3468.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">newer research</a> may change that).  As a result your peak impact force in a crash will not substantially change and you will be under a similar risk for brain injury as being helmet less.</p>

<p>Also you mentioned having to replace bike helmets that take an impact as a downside. If you wonder why bicycle helmets are not made with foam that ""bounces back"" (e.g. hockey helmets) this is because it can cause <em>more</em> damage in an impact.  With this type of foam your brain receives force in the initial hit and then it experiences a secondary ""hit"" as the foam returns (often these non-crushable foams return rapidly).  Crushable foam however does not rebound as it remains crushed. The downside is that once it is crushed it no longer provides any protective benefit and needs to be replaced. By extension when the crushable foam degrades it also needs to be replaced.  This is why it is also suggested that old bicycle helmets also need to be replaced (what constitutes old is up for debate).  In this case the crushable foam has degraded over time and its impact absorption properties change for the worse and will not provide the same benefit in an impact as a newer helmet with foam that has not degraded.</p>

<p>Finally, I do remember hearing about a new type of foam that behaves similar to the crushable foam used in helmets, but rebounds slowly.  I will have to work to find that reference. But if they are in the marketplace they will be more robust to hits and repeat impacts.</p>

"What type of bicycle would be the most suitable for riding in winter in the city?","9329","","<p>Say you have any type of bike available (BMX, Trial, MTB, etc.) and you can ride them all on the same level, just for the sake of the argument. What bicycle would be best to choose to ride in the city (short distances, traffic, people) in a very bad winter condition (snow, ice, etc) and why would you make such a decision?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I'm asking this question because I have both a BMX and an MTB bike available and since I plan on riding a lot during the winter, I could go as far as buying another type of bike especially for that purpose. Both my BMX and MTB bikes are newly bought 2011 models, so they have all the today's features of a standard bike.</p>
","<p>In general, you want a drivetrain with low gears, the ability to fit snow tires (and maybe fenders), and a bike that's agile and maneuverable yet able to stay upright and steady with little effort. </p>

<p>What tires are good for snow? Wide tires are good, knobbies are good, but studded tires will help you on ice and packed snow (and maybe on fresh but wet snow, although that's debatable). </p>

<p>Here's my run-through on various types of bikes and how they'd fare as snow bikes: </p>

<p><strong>Road bikes</strong> generally take skinny tires and are unsuitable for ice and snow, although there are exceptions. The drivetrain will have those low gears, mostly, but these are built for speed, not slow riding. Road drivetrains are relatively fragile and would be more likely to be harmed by road salt and ice. </p>

<p><strong>Touring bikes</strong> can be fitted with snow tires, and they usually have room for fenders and those studded tires (although they may get an accumulation of snow packed in between the tire and fender). They're quite sturdy and can take a beating, and the drivetrain will handle road salt well as long as you clean it from time to time, but you get what you pay for: a food steel touring bike is heavy and expensive. These will have clearance to mount fenders. Touring drivetrains are built with low, low gears to climb hills with a load of camping and cooking stuff - and low gears like this are great for traction on ice. </p>

<p><strong>Folding bikes</strong> are amazingly useful in the city, as they pack up small (think: storage in a city apartment, and taking them on city transit). Small wheels can be hard to find studded tires for, but are amazingly nimble. My Dahon Curve with 16"" knobby tires does a respectable job in the snow. Downside: A bit more expensive that a bike of comparable quality, as they're more complicated machines. Because, well, they fold. An upside is that these bikes often come with internal hubs, which are amazingly resistant to snow and road salt.  </p>

<p><strong>Mountain bikes</strong> are built for trails and dirt, come with 26"" tires - easy to find snow tires for, and stock knobbies can already handle light snow and ice fairly well. There's usually room for fenders as well. Mountain drivetrains will have the low gears you want for traction on slippery surfaces. Whether the drivetrain can take a winter depends on the bike, but most should be comparable to a touring bike. </p>

<p><strong>BMX bikes</strong> - Not sure if you can fit fenders on these, but I'd guess that's touch-and-go. 20"" studded tires aren't unheard of. Would make a good snow bike if you can find tires and fenders for it. My experience with small-wheeled bikes leads me to guess that these might be a little twitchy on snow - but the low center of gravity might compensate for that. Anyone have a comment on this? </p>

<p><strong>Cruisers</strong> are kinda like mountain bikes with a long wheelbase, a more upright and comfortable position, and they're not build for speed or hill-climbing. Unsuitable for snow or ice, unless you live in a very flat area and are okay with going very slow. Cruisers often have internal hubs or even a single-speed drivetrain, great for dealing with snow and road salt. </p>

<hr>

<p>In the end, unless it has a very delicate drivetrain I'd go for using the mountain bike for snow and ice. These bikes are already built for rough conditions and, importantly, you can get 26"" studded tires fairly simply. BMX bikes usually take 20"" tires, which are harder (but not impossible) to find studded tires for. </p>

<p>If you want to keep your new bikes in better condition and will buy a bike specifically for winter riding - hardly unreasonable, many riders do this since winter riding is hard on a drivetrain - consider a used steel or aluminum hardtail mountain bike. The hardtail frame will give you incredible control. There's a question about flat bars vs. riser bars (as well as stem length) <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/5550/how-can-i-move-the-handlebars-on-a-mountain-bike-close-to-the-rider-without-affec"">right here</a>. (That bike will be used as a winter bike as well as a bike for gravel trails in the summer.) </p>

"Can you use a SRAM 10-speed Powerlock with a Shimano chain/drivetrain?","9286","","<p>I just bought a pair of SRAM Powerlocks for 10-speed chains. The packaging says that they can only be used with SRAM chains. Will anything nasty happen if I use it with a Shimano chain and cassette?</p>

"Is a 7 speed chainring compatible with an 8, 9 or 10 speed cassette and chain?","9281","","<p>Currently I have a 7 speed cassette (13-23) running with a spacer on a new Tiagra hub. After I changed my chain, the wear has made two of the gears unusable.</p>

<p>I am considering changing the cassette to increase the number of gears. The simple option would be 8 speed (12-23). The other alternative looking at the chainrings would be a complete change to 9 (11-23) or 10 (11-25) speed and drop a few teeth at the front.</p>

<p>Will my current chainring be incompatible with a new cassette and chain? In other words, can I use a 9 or 10 speed chain with a chainring designed for a 7 speed cassette and chain? Is there a significant difference in durability between the setups?</p>

<p>I mainly use by bike for commuting and light road touring.</p>
","<p>Your chainring and front derailleur should work just fine with a 10 speed chain and cassette.</p>

<p>The primary concern with your upgrade will not be the chainring and front derailleur, but rather the rear shifter and derailleur. A 7 speed shifter or derailleur will not work with an 8 or 9 speed cassette, so you will need to buy new ones. But at least your upgrades will be limited to the rear components.</p>

"Aluminum seatpost stuck to a steel frame","9281","","<p>I'm trying to free my aluminum seatpost corroded to a CrMo frame. One of the methods is to heat the aluminum seatpost and then to let it cool. In theory, the aluminum will expand twice as fast as steel and hence the expansion/contraction should crack the bond.</p>

<p>Some recommend using a blow torch or even boiling water. I don't have access to a blow torch, but was wondering if there was something better than boiling water.</p>

","<p>I have an identical problem, having been rinding the bike without seat clamp for more than two years now.</p>

<p>I suppose you have already read something about it, if not I recommend Sheldon Brown on the <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/stuck-seatposts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">subject</a>. But I must warn you that the ammonia theory didn't work for me, and I tried ammonia on some aluminum sample parts without any visible effect (corrosion, oxide removal, whatever).</p>

<p>The problems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aluminum oxide occupies more space than pure aluminum. This, oxidation of aluminum posts create EXTRA VOLUME inside the seat tube, and this can create huge forces;</li>
<li>Aluminum and steel create a GALVANIC PAIR of metals, inducing electrolytic reaction between them, with dire consequences as you have already noticed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe the solution, failing the chemical approach, must be oriented towards two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dilation, a drastic one, but TO THE COLD! Since aluminum dilates more than steel, you should FREEZE the seatpost, by pouring some very very cold substance inside. Liquid nitrogen (frostbite danger), dry ice (perhaps not cold enough) and CO2 cartridges (doesn't remain inside for too long) are good candidates. Perhaps if you wrap a towel around the seat tube, pour boiling water on it, then pour the freezing stuff of your preference inside the seat tube, you'll crack the bond indeed, as you planned.</li>
<li>Total mechanical disintegration. You'd look for some heavy machining tools (lathes and all) and eat the post from inside. Some damage to the inner surface of the seat tube is very probable.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't believe too much in brute force if the seatpost is frozen inside for too long (more than three months since last ""movement""), but skilled shop owners have been asuring me that it is possible (I didn't go all the way with this for now because fortunately the current seat height is working and I don't want to risk being too many days without the bike).</p>

"What does a flashing yellow arrow traffic signal mean?","9255","","<p>While bike commuting in an urban setting, I've started noticing that some intersections have flashing yellow turn signals during part of the light cycle. What does this mean? If I am on my bike in the turn lane and a flashing arrow appears, can I proceed with the turn or should I wait for the arrow to turn green?</p>
","<p>Flashing yellow arrows have been introduced in the US recently to help ease congestion at intersections. This signal should be treated similar to a yield sign or a turn lane not controlled by its own traffic signal. If there is no oncoming traffic, you may make a left turn if it is safe to do so, but you must yield to any oncoming traffic and to any pedestrians in the crosswalk you would cross when turning.</p>

<p>Although laws vary regionally with regards to how bicycles are treated in traffic, in most cases a cyclist would handle this situation the same as any other vehicle. If there is no oncoming, you can make a left turn, but be wary of traffic coming the other way. It may be safer to wait if you don't have a full view of oncoming lanes (i.e. if there is a blind corner or low visibility), since it will take you longer to clear the intersection than a motorized vehicle, and drivers coming the other way will not be expecting a bicycle in the intersection during their green light cycle.</p>

<li>a small car jack. Most u-locks lock on one side and connect with an L on the other, so bending the U open will release it</li>

<p>Thieves also use leverage based attacks, but I believe those risk damaging the bike.</p>

<p>And, of course, having proper proof that the bicycle is yours is a good idea, too, since all those attempts to defeat a lock look suspicious.</p>

"Can I convert a road frame to a mountain bike?","9190","","<p>Some years ago, I picked up a Cannondale R3000 and moved all the components to my current bike as an exercise in bike building, never repeated (in fairness, the Cannondale fit me a little better but my beautiful 1998 Klein has such a sweet, sweet paint job...). I've been putting the frame on Craigslist off and on for a few years, but no one seems to want to pay what I'm asking. Regardless, my current MTB is an all-mountain beast that I bought before I knew my riding style, and I'm thinking of picking up a more cross-country steed.</p>

<p>Times being tight and all, is there anything preventing me from building out the Cannondale road frame as a mountain bike? Obvious [potential] answers (e.g., tire clearance) are good, more involved ones (e.g., frame robustness) are too. I'm trying to get a picture of what might lie ahead in this venture.</p>
","<p>If you want to use it for ""proper mountain biking"" (however you define that) the answer is almost certainly no. You won't be able to fit wide enough tyres to give you decent grip, and punctures are likely to be a problem. Additionally, the geometry will be all wrong (if you put straight bars on it you'll probably feel quite cramped without a long stem, which will make the handling wierd). That's without getting into the strength issue - Cannondales have always seemed quite fragile to me (but that's an opinion only, never owned one).</p>

<p>However, if you want something for blasting along relatively smooth forest trails that aren't muddy, fit the widest grippiest tyres you can and give it a whirl. Despite what I said about strength in relation to proper mountain biking, road bikes are surprisingly strong provided the forces are applied to them in the way the bike is designed. A few small bumps are unlikely to break it assuming you're not a large rider, you don't try jumping and you don't crash. It'll be a very different experience from a proper mountain bike, but on the right trails could still be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately though for proper cross country mountain biking you do need a mountain bike (or a cyclo cross bike). I'd suggest trying ebay with a reserve price to find out what people are prepared to pay for it. Second hand aluminium road bike frames aren't that desireable any more, even if they did have dura ace on them when purchased, simply because carbon frames are so much cheaper. However, second hand mountain bike frames are also pretty cheap, and a couple of hundred dollars towards one from selling the R3000 frame is infinitely more than nothing if it's just gathering dust.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

"What harm results from riding with a stretched chain?","9180","","<p>Due to sheer laziness, my maintenance amounts to an annual trip to the LBS.  After moving, my new LBS suggested that I replace my chain immediately, before it destroys the drive train.  What they didn't mention was that it already had, so I needed a new cassette within a week, because the chain slipped under pressure.</p>

<p>The next year, they checked the cassette <em>before</em> recommending a chain replacement, and it was already getting worn, so I decided to stay with the current chain at least as long as it takes to pay for a new cassette in the chains I'm not purchasing every thousand miles.  At about three thousand miles a year, it shouldn't take all that long.</p>

<p>Now, though, I'm concerned that I might be causing more problems than just cassette wear.  Might I have to replace the chain ring, too?  Am I setting myself up for other potentially expensive problems?  Is the chain likely to break in the middle of a ride within the next year or two?</p>
","<p>This is always a controversial topic, with some people arguing on both sides, but in my opinion you should replace your chain when it reaches the official ""worn"" state (as indicated by a chain stretch gauge).  If you let the chain go the sprockets develop a ""hook"" and will begin ""sucking"" the chain.  In addition, shifting performance will suffer.</p>

<p>If a chain is replaced when it first reaches ""worn"" status, without letting it go too long, the sprockets will not have taken a ""set"" to the stretched chain and reasonably good drivetrain performance will be retained.</p>

<p>Failing to replace a worn chain results in more cluster wear, more chainring wear, and an increased risk of both shifting difficulty and thrown/broken chains.</p>

<p>You will of course eventually need to replace your cluster and chainrings.  My experience is that you need a new cluster about every five chains, and new chainrings about every two clusters.  Generally when cluster/chainring wear reaches a critical point things go to pot pretty rapidly in terms of shifting problems, slipping, etc.</p>

<p>How do I set the edge computer to deal with this (I assume it needs to know to take speed from the sensor and not GPS, and just trying to use it as normal failed).</p>
","<p>I'm basing this on my 810 but I assume they're similar.</p>

<p>You can create a new profile for riding on the turbo. For each profile you can select which sensors are used. If you turn off GPS and turn on cadence and speed (and HR if you have it) you can use it indoors. You might need another sensor to pick up wheel speed if you only have a cadence sensor. A combined (speed and cadence) one is around £35 in the UK, not sure what they'd be in Sweden.</p>

"Least worn tyre: front or back?","9132","","<p>Where should I put the least worn tyre? on the front or the back? This is for XC MTB.</p>
","<p>The Good or less worn tire should go on the front wheel as indicated in this Sheldon Brown Article on <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-rotation.html"">Tire Rotation</a></p>

<p>Although the article does hint to the fact that you should not be really rotating tires to the front wheel that may have been used on the rear wheel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The only time tire rotation is appropriate on a bicycle is when you are replacing the rear tire. If you feel like taking the trouble, and use the same type of tire front and rear, you should move the front tire to the rear wheel, and install the new tire in front.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The reason for this is that the front tire is much more critical for safety than the rear, so you should have the more reliable tire on the front.</p>
  
  <p>If you have a blowout, if it is on the rear tire, you have a very good chance of bringing the bike to a controlled stop. If your front tire blows, you can lose steering control, and a crash is a real possibility.</p>

","<p>You'd have to calulate the actual forces to be 100% sure but it's not going to be a problem: forces on front wheel/fork/headset while e.g. just sitting on the bike, braking or landing jumps will be (much) higher than the force applied from hanging it.</p>

<p>That being said, I do note at least two problems with this setup: first, good luck getting one of the center bikes out without touching or getting stuck in another bike. Second: from the picture it seems like you'd have to hold the bike with one hand then use the other to attach it. Ok for a roadbike, but for anything heavier that is just hard. Usually these systems have an open 'C'-shaped fixed hook into which you simply hang the bike which is much more convenient.</p>

"What do I need to know when replacing my inner tube/tires?","9085","","<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>

<p>The inner tube on my bike burst the other day, I took it home and salvaged another one from a bike that's been sitting unused in my garage for years.</p>

<p>The New(old) innertube inflates fine but when I inflated it I noticed that the inner tube was spilling out through a gash in the stitching of the tire.</p>

<p>I've temporarily replaced the tire with another that I had lying about but the ripped one was a semi slick and the one I've replaced it with is a mountain biking one, I'd prefer a semi slick tire.</p>

<p>I know I'm going to have to replace the tire as well.</p>

<p>The new inner tube seems spongier and I can't seem to get it to inflate as much as the old one.</p>

<p>I'm a relatively new to (serious) cycling, and this is the first time I've had to replace an inner tube or a wheel.</p>

<p>I mainly cycle on roads and cycle paths, the cycle path I use it just rough enough for me not to justify getting a full on road bike.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What do I need to know in order to go into a shop and get the right replacement inner tube/ tire for my bike? I'm aware that there are different sizes of tyre (mine is 26"") and there is another number which I assume is width (Old was 1.5""). Is this all I need to know?</p>

<p>Do I need to know anything about the inner tubes? I assume the size is the same as the tire, are there different grades or types of inner tube? Why would one be spongier than the other?</p>
","<p>Omar,</p>

<p>I think I understand the issue. Just to clarify, is this what happened:</p>

<p>Burst tyre. Replaced tube with one left lying around.
This revealed a split in the sidewall, thus the tyre is now gash.
Now looking for a new tyre to replace the old one.</p>

<p>All mountain bikes (well, almost all. But we'll leave that aside for the moment) have 26"" diameter wheels, so that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>Mountain bike tyres tend to come in toroidal diameters of 1.9-2.35"". They also tend to be fairly flexible to help with grip &amp; dampening down impacts. This will be why you're feeling the difference between them.</p>

<p>Commuting/slick tyres seem to com in 1.25-1.5"". They will have a harder casing, be more resilient and (obviously) lack all the knobbles.</p>

<p>Ok, answer time:</p>

<p>You need a 26"" tyre. I'd go for something that matches your remaining functional tyre, so you want a 1.5"". Be aware that not all companies' tyres come up the same (Specialized come up big for the measurement &amp; Panaracer come up small).</p>

<p>after that there are some choices to be made. If you can afford it, you want to replace with a ""folding"" tyre. This means that the bead around the edge of the tyre is made of kevlar or similar plastic rather than steel wire. This makes the tyre lighter (and thus easier to accelerate or brake) and, crucially makes it easier to get on and off in the case of another puncture.</p>

<p>Different tyres offer different levels of protection against punctures &amp; pinch flats. It's best to have a look at each individually. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.hargrovescycles.co.uk/products.asp?category=Wheels%20Tyres%20Tubes&amp;product=Nimbus%2026%20X%201.50"" rel=""nofollow"">Specialized Nimbus</a> is a good tyre, but with the wire bead. Available in 1.5</p>

<p>This one from <a href=""http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=53937"" rel=""nofollow"">Panaracer</a> might be worth a look.</p>

EDIT:

<p>Oh, Daniel makes a good point about valves. The chances are you're on Schrader (car type), but look at what's on the other wheel.</p>

<p>Regarding tubes themselves. They're pretty much much of a muchness. Specialized ones are good, continental ones are fine but pricey. Only buy something that has a brand on the box.</p>

<p>Regarding tubes, again Daniel is spot on. They come with a range of sizes. So long as your tyre is within that range you'll be fine (though Mel's been running 1.5-2.2 tubes in a piar of 2.35 tyres for about 6 months without any issues).</p>

"Why are steel bikes more expensive than aluminum?","9084","","<p>It's hard to find a chrome moly bike for less than $1000 these days.  Is it because it's actually less expensive to manufacture aluminum bikes these days or is the market for chrome moly bikes so small that economies of scale make aluminum bikes cheaper?</p>
","<p>(I'll ignore the chain store things with two wheels and pedals, I refrain from calling those bicycles) </p>

<p>I ride a steel Hard-tail MTB, by choice, and found it easy to choose my bike - The choice was so limited it was a Jamis Dragon or aluminum...... I carry an extra couple of pounds over a similar spec, same price point aluminum bike. I traded my 10.5kg Aluminum framed MTB for a 13.5kg Steel......</p>

<p>Back in the 1990's the unwashed masses were taught that Aluminum was a superior material in every way, and most people still think so (Except those than can afford and want carbon). It does not rust, is lighter and stiffer and....)  Most people, even those that should know better, think weight is God when comparing bikes, and measure it's advantages in $/gram saved. It takes skill to build a reasonably weighted steel frame, whereas any idiot can build a respectably weighted Aluminum frame (with skill, Aluminum will be lighter than steel). Theres even a web site dedicated to weights of bike parts.... </p>

<p>Look at the Q and A's here- how many people state that ""steel rusts and is heavy"" - most of them will never have ridden, let alone owned a steel bike (except perhaps one of those cheap chain store things). Perceptions are steel is ""So 1908's ....""  </p>

<p>Now look at the cheaper end of the market - these are not typically serious riders. These are Novices relying on advice from friends and Salesmen. The ONLY thing they can use to compare bikes in a shop is weight. Even if they go for a test ride, they won't feel the difference between bikes, let along the subtle difference between a steel and alloy frame in the shop car park. The salesman knows this - so he sells ""Weight is everything"", and harps on about how every gram is critical. The up sell to the next model is then easy - it's so much lighter, and only another $100...... </p>

<p>So put this together, people buying steel frames are few and far between. Those that do tend to know bikes and want a reasonably good one. Theres enough of a market to build steel framed bikes, but those customers know what they want and will pay a premium for it. It's fairly small, so the profit needs to from margin, not volume. As the market is not big enough for a major competition between manufacturers only a few play in it, and they can set prices accordingly. </p>

"Bailing out with SPD pedals on a mountain bike","9032","","<p>I got a new mountain bike a year ago, with SPD pedals. I'm OK with these on a road bike (that I don't normally crash), but on a mountain bike when I crash I usually can't jump off the bike like I used to. I can handle stopping OK, but when I'm about to crash I can't jump off and land on my feet.</p>

<p>Do I need to loosen the pedal settings? Should I unclip when I'm getting to a hard part on the trail? (I have pedals that work both ways.) Or should I just practice crashing until I get it right? What do ""real"" mountain bikers do?</p>
","<p>Your best option is to practice a lot on how to unclip your foot, so you get accustomed to it. I suppose you have already done this. So you must now adjust the spring tension on your pedals. Refer to the instruction manual on how to adjust it.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I have found that dirt, grime and other pollution in the cleats makes it extra hard to get the foot free. It gets to your pedals every time you step on mud or soft soil and then go back to he pedal, something that does not happen so frequently for a road biker.</p>

<p>When you cleat after stepping on mud or soft soil your shoe picks up little stones, little stems, leaves and all sort of things that clog up the pedal's mechanism, and the pedaling action makes all this dirt get to critical places.</p>

<p>That's why I recommend to thoroughly clean the pedals and oiling them between rides. Normally you won't get too much dirt in only one ride, but you don't want it to get accumulated, for this worsens the performance of the release mechanism. Oil helps a lot for clipping in and out, but also helps a little by not allowing some dirt to stick to the mechanism (Your pedal won't be so dirty by the end of the ride).</p>

<p>Tip #2: you should periodically inspect your pedals and cleats for dents, deformations and other that can affect your ability to clip out. Specifically I've had trouble with the ""ramps"" that push the cleat out when you twist your foot. For some reason these develop a kind of hook that prevents the foot from twisting. You can easily file out these deformations, usually they are surprisingly tiny! Use a fine file or a rotary tool (dremel) with a fine grit grinding stone.</p>

<p>Tip #3: Part of some training I also did, was about conquering difficult technical sections without removing any foot from its pedal. I did this by  building small obstacles in the middle of an ample flat terrain. The Obstacles where made of stones and logs, trying to make then with increased difficulty every time, but always made then in such a way that if I fell it wouldn't hurt much, hence the flat clean terrain around the obstacle. This kind of training gives the rider a lot of self confidence and builds the necessary skills that make the use of cleated pedals more intuitive at the required level for MTB riding.</p>

<p>These tips have kept me clipped for 10 years of mountain biking, doing XC, and a little all-mountain and downhill. </p>

<p>My final comment: IF you're accustomed to SPD on your road bike, make an effort to stay on SPD for your mountain bike, if you remove them, almost sure you'll miss them! </p>

"Why do e-bikes need dedicated tires?","9010","","<p>While shopping for new tires on my bike, I saw that some dealers had a specific section for e-bike tires, where the various brands production for e-bikes was present.</p>

<p>Why do e-bikes need dedicated tires?</p>
","<p>They don't <em>need</em> them but they are good to have. I have an e-bike that I use as a daily commuter. Here are my thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>E-bikes are heavier than regular bikes and put considerably more power out at the rear wheel (my motor has 350 watts, I add maybe 60-80 watts at most) compared to a regular bike which only has 80 watts alone.</li>
<li>E-bikes travel at much higher average speeds than regular commuter bikes. I average 30km/h with peaks of 40km/h which is the electronic assist speed limit. More importantly, I don't make any attempt to conserve inertia as I do with a regular bike, so I stop at all the stop signs and traffic lights. Thus, there's a  lot of braking and acceleration that I do that is hard on the bike and its wheels.</li>
<li>Finally, the rear tire needs to be sturdy as it is getting more wear and also taking bigger hits on bumps at higher speeds than a standard tire.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, I'm still on the original tire which is a regular tire. I'm on the tail end of its lifetime which has only been about 1/3 that of a regular tire. I will replace it either with a beefy ""regular"" tire or go with one from an e-bike line. I think the actual difference between the two (beefy regular or touring and a e-bike tire) will in reality be minimal.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Ebikes require a strong, hard-wearing, high speed, puncture resistant tire. These are also roughly the same requirements as touring tires so some vendors are labeling their touring tires as ""ebike ready.""</p>

"What features of a mountain bike's geometry gives it different characteristics?","9001","","<p>When you see descriptions of mountain bikes they are usually described as XC, trail, enduro etc. and have different geometries based on what sort of category they fall into. What are the defining characteristics of the bikes and their geometries for the different categories of riding? What makes a trail bike a trail bike and not an XC bike for instance?</p>
","<ul>
<li>The shorter the distance between the bottom bracket and saddle lowers pedalling efficiency, but increases standover height which gives you more room to throw the bike around.  This feature gets more pronounced as the riding style the bike is designed for becomes more aggressive i.e. an enduro frame will sacrifice some pedalling efficiency for stability over very rough downhill terrain.</li>
<li>A longer top tube leans the rider forward centring the weight distribution more, this gives better stability in the air and over rough terrain, but causes the bike to feel a little less manoeuvrable because it's harder to pull the front up.</li>
<li>Shorter chainstays allow the front of the bike to pull up easier because the pedals are closer to the rear axle (the pivot point when pulling the front up).  Aggressive bikes that want the stability of the longer top tube often shorten the chainstays to keep the bike feeling more nimble.</li>
<li>A higher bottom bracket lifts the centre of gravity up making the bike more difficult to corner, but a low bike is a bike that scrapes rocks more...</li>
<li>A steeper head angle results in a more responsive, lighter feeling steering.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to give an XC example:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pure XC bike will have a large BB to saddle height to maximise pedal efficiency, therefore a low standover height, but this isn't too much of a sacrifice as an XC bike is not aimed at very rough terrain.</li>
<li>Often rather than a long top tube, they have a slightly shorter one and use a longer stem.  This keeps the weight forward so the front doesn't keep lifting when pedalling hard up hill, but keeps the steering feeling light (not always desirable...).</li>
<li>Longer chainstays for the same reason as above.</li>
<li>Steep headangle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst an enduro:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will have a low BB to saddle height so it can be thrown around over very rough terrain.</li>
<li>A long top tube for the extra stability.  An enduro bike can't use the long stem trick to minimise the top tube length, because long stems make the steering feel 'overactive' which is horrible on rough terrain.</li>
<li>Short chainstays to mitigate the long tube.</li>
<li>Slightly slacker head angle because it makes the bike more stable when going downhill.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most MTB frame styles have roughly the same BB height, as everyone wants a better cornering bike and it's difficult to pedal over rough terrain anyway.  The only exception I think of are pure downhilling frames, where a very low BB height is desired but to minimise pedal smashes, shorter crank lengths are the norm.</p>

<p>Headangles tend to quite steep on most MTB frames even on very different styles, for example XC and dirt jump frames have similar headtube angles.  Once again the notable exception are downhilling frames, which have very slack headangles; although this for improving stability when on steep descents (it's harder to go over the bars).</p>

<p>The above is an oversimplification.  In the real world the parts play off each other, and their characteristics will change as a bike moves through the rear travel (if it's got any of course).  Also the above are frame characteristics; the length of stem, width of the bars, length of cranks, height of forks, etc. all play their part in the overall feel just as much as the frame does.</p>

Similar to what zenbiker has noted above for the Tacx Fortius, when compared against an on-bike power meter the Flow tends to underreport -- though as one might expect from the plot above it underreports consistently. In my own case, with my own tires, a better agreement between the Flow and a Power Tap (which had been statically-checked for accuracy) could be achieved with a coast down calibration of 4 and a scale factor of 120, though I suspect that could differ from tire to tire. </p>

<p>A greater problem for the Flow is its ability to adjust load while in ""ergo"" mode. In that case, one sets the power level and then, in theory at least, one can pedal at different cadences and speeds while the Flow adjusts the load to keep power constant. Sadly, here the Flow was overmatched. The plot below shows the percent error for three different scale factors (80, 100, and 120) when plotted against the ratio of ""ergo power"" to speed. That is, suppose you set the Flow to hold its power in ergo mode at 250 watts and pedaled at 20 km/h, then 30 km/h, then 40 km/h, and so on. The ratio of ergo power to speed (in km/h) would be 12.5, 8.3, 6.25, and so on. If the Flow were able to adjust its load at different wheel speeds, each group of points would be horizontal and parallel, and, in an ideal world one could adjust the scale factor to move some group of points up or down until it hovered over the zero error line. Why look at the ratio of power to speed? Power is the product of wheel speed and wheel torque (and a constant) so dividing the ergo power setting by wheel speed gives the torque at the Flow's roller. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9URa.png"" alt=""Ergo mode error in Tacx Flow""></p>

<p>What you will see is that the groups of points are far from horizontal so the error between the power desired and actual power (as measured with a Power Tap) is not at all constant. At high wheel speeds the Flow is unable to generate enough load to maintain constant power. Whether that inability is related to the load generator itself (which is also used in the I-Magic) or the Flow's control head, I could not determine. </p>

"Disk brake squealing after bike shop changed my pads. Is it enough reason to ask them to re-service (for free)?","8997","","<p>I recently took my bike to the shop, since it started making a weird metal on metal (not squeal, just hard brushing sound). After checking it out they saw that the back brake pads were really (REALLY) worn down, so they changed them. </p>

<p>Now my bike is doing a really loud screechy sound when I use the back brakes, and the bike doesn't even stop that fast, I remember my back brakes being pretty strong, completely stopping the back wheel even if I was going fast (of course, if I was going fast it would drift a little.. but the wheel was locked). Now it's making this loud sound and just kind of slowing me down slowly, but not fully breaking.</p>

<p>I didn't know if this was normal.. but after reading a few question here like this, it seems like it is definitely not. (<a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/4486/fixing-noisy-v-brakes"">Fixing noisy V brakes</a>) </p>

<p><strong>Is this a legitimate reason to take the bike back to the shop and tell them there is something wrong with their work?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks! </p>
","<p>I tend to run into the same scenario when I replace my own brake pads on my bike's TRP Spyre mechanical disc brakes. TRP is Tektro's high-end division, and I use Shimano B01S resin pads or anything similarly shaped (TRP says pads for Shimano BR-M515/M575 calipers will fit).</p>

<p>The cause of the squealing in my experience is <em>the lack of proper bed-in</em>. Disc brakes (even on cars) work best when there is enough of the brake pad's friction material deposited onto the face of the rotor. When you change and install new brake pads, this synergy is lost. The rotors still have the ""memory"" of the old brake pad material on their faces, with very tiny imperfections that don't line up with the surface of the new pads, and this is what gives the high-pitched squealing. When you bed in new pads to the rotors, you're effectively scrubbing off the old friction material while replacing it with that of the new pads'.</p>

<p>To bed-in new brake pads, find a flat surface or downhill incline where you can build up a bit of speed. Accelerate to about 10 miles an hour, then pull on the levers - smoothly but powerfully - to an almost complete stop. Keep repeating this over and over. With enough cycles you will notice the squealing become less audible.</p>

<p>Some people even resort to sanding of the rotor faces and fresh pads with 100-grit and 220-grit sandpaper in order to get the old friction material off and quicken the whole bed-in process. Be careful handling the brake rotor, though - best to use gloves for this job as skin oils can easily contaminate a rotor.</p>

<p>Brake pads will also naturally bed-in by themselves, but you will have to bear with the screeching that whole time.</p>

"Can I use a shock pump to inflate a tube?","8966","","<p>I know that shock pumps are meant for high pressure applications so that they can withstand high pressures needed by suspension shocks. </p>

<p>However, can I use a shock pump to inflate my tire in a pinch if I run out of CO2?  How would it compare to a standard mini-pump in terms of volume? </p>
","<p><em>Note: this calculation makes many assumptions, so it's only useful in an 'average use case', not some sort of exact measurement. If you find better information, please post it and I'll update the answer.</em></p>

<p>How many pumps you would need to fill up a tire depends on many variables. First, the volume of your inner tube, which can be approximated as a torus (doughnut-shape) atop the rim size of a given diameter. You can find yours approximated <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrjoeball/4525757653/"" rel=""noreferrer"">on this graph</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>26"" Mountain Bike, 2.1"" tire width = 4.8L</li>
<li>29"" Mountain Bike, 2.1"" tire width = 5.2L</li>
<li>700C Road Bike, 35mm tire width = 2L</li>
<li>20"" BMX Bike, 1.85"" tire width = 3L</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm finding pump specifications quite difficult to find (I need piston diameter and stroke length), but <a href=""http://www.competitivecyclist.com/review-pumps-co2-inflators/shock-pump-shootout_620.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's a comparison</a> of some shock pumps on an empty shock cylinder of a 2007 Fox 36 RLC 160mm Fork.</p>

<ul>
<li>Average Accu-Gage Pressure Reading after 100 strokes: 77.2 psi</li>
<li>My best guess at RC2 air chamber specifications: 1"" (25.4mm) diameter, 160mm length (max travel). If someone can find accurate specs or the true volume, I'd appreciate it.</li>
<li>Fox RC2 Air Volume (estimated): <code>Vcylinder = pi*r^2*h</code> = 81 mL</li>
</ul>

<p>So then, IF pumping air into different volumes is linearly proportional (it's not, but somewhere in the ball park), and you wanted to inflate the tires listed above to ~77.2psi, it'd take about this number of pumps with the 'average' shock pump:</p>

"What is the widest tyre that you can get away with, on a standard road bike?","8912","","<p>In general, what is the widest tyre that you can get away with, on a standard road bike (with dual pivot brakes)?</p>

<p>Edit: I have a Campagnolo Eurus wheelset.</p>
","<p>With a bike designed around modern ""short-reach"" 39-49mm calipers, you're going to four main issues:</p>

<p>1) Brake clearance vertically.  If everything else is optimal, a 49mm reach caliper should be able to clear around a 32mm tire.  You can verify this with an unmounted brake.</p>

<p>2) Brake clearance horizontally.  Extra cable tension releases (e.g. in levers or inline) help with this, but the maximum width that the calipers can spread will not be enough to allow an inflated tire through, and even with a deflated tire you might have to force it.</p>

<p>3) Frame clearance. You'll need to have adequate clearance in three places: seatstay bridge, chainstay bridge, and fork crown.  In extremely aerodynamic frames, you also may have issues with seat tube clearance.</p>

<p>4) Rim width of your current wheelset.  The <a href=""http://www.campagnolo.com/repository/documenti/en/EURUS_cl_-12-10.pdf"">Campagnolo Eurus</a> wheelset has a 15mm wide rim.  The general rule of thumb is that <A href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#width"">a tire should be no more than 1.45 to 2.0 times the rim width</a>, which would limit you to roughly 30mm wide tires at the biggest.</p>

<p>In general 23mm should be expected, 25mm is likely, and 28mm is occasionally possible.  What actually works on a given short reach frame is going to be heavily dependent on the factors above.  Bikes with medium-reach (57mm) or long-reach brakes are more capable; I do road riding on a classic 27""-wheeled Trek refitted for 700c with long-reach brakes, 33.3mm tires and full fenders.</p>

"Why is it easier to follow a cyclist up-hill","8906","","<p>Watching the Tour de France on TV I notice that the riders like to ride close behind other riders when going up a steep hill. </p>

<p>I understand that rider can benefit from a slipstream on the flat section, but on a climb the speed is so slow, the slipstream has minimal effect. </p>

<p>When climbing, the TV commentators make a big deal of the importance of riders 'getting on to the wheel' of the riders ahead as if it will be much easier if the rider could attach himself to the group ahead.</p>

<p>What is the benefit of being attached to a group when climbing? </p>
","<p>I have raced Cat 1/2 for a number of years (elite road cycling) and I can unequivocally say the many here have no clue what they are talking about.  On a climb ""getting on the wheel"" is <em>rarely</em> about slipstreaming (unless there is a severe headwind), instead its about   positioning, pacing and psychology.</p>

<p><strong>Position and Pacing</strong></p>

<p>Rides who attack or lead out the climb are strong and will likely be climbing near their aerobic threshold.  If you don't get on immediately, a gap will form.  If you want to catch up (close the gap) you will have to work <strong>hard</strong> likely putting in an anaerobic effort.  This is not good as it will reduce your capacity to respond to future attacks (you only want to go anaerobic or near anaerobic when you absolutely have to). Then best analogy is you are like book of matches, you get so many strikes so use them wisely.  If you immediate latch onto the wheel it is your best shot at keeping your pace aerobic, therefore conserving a match.</p>

<p>Conversely, lets suppose you say ""%^#* it I'll let a gap form.""  You continue climbing eventually matching the pace so that the gap doesn't get too big.  When you reach the top, you will have put in virtually the same effort, but they will have started on the downhill  before you reach the top.  The gap will now get even wider and all of a sudden you are screwed. You are at speed and now you have an even bigger gap to close plus you now have the added disadvantage that slipstreaming has suddenly become important again. Facing this you have two real choices, cross your fingers and hope the peloton slows (which it may - the peloton is a fickle beast), OR bust your ass and close that damn gap.  The rub is if you do close the gap you put in twice the effort you would have if you had simply got on the damn wheel when the climbing started.</p>

<p>Road racing is like chess.  You need to plan at least five moves ahead, but unlike chess there are virtually no restriction to the type of moves you can make and there are 150 simultaneous players.</p>

<p><strong>Psychology</strong> </p>

<p>Some here seem to believe there is no psychology involved with getting on someone's wheels on a climb.  WRONG.</p>

<p>If someone is climbing hard (at a pace you find hard to match) the best thing you can do is sit on their wheel as close as possible (we are talking 2 inches gap).  You just stare at that frackin' wheel and you DO NOT let that gap widen.  You tell yourself that you don't care how much it hurts, you will not let the gap widen.  You then keep repeating this to yourself and before you know it the climb is over.  </p>

<p>In all seriousness, when you are right on your aerobic threshold you have to nail pacing.  Riding really close lets you judge when you are slacking off.  It is much easier to work to pick up an inch or two that you lost when your concentration waned, than it is to be farther away from the rider and realize he/she has put 5-10 feet on you.  When everyone is at a similar fitness level you need to fight for every bloody inch you can get. Focusing on something like the wheel in front helps you not focus on the pain you are currently enduring.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Aside</strong> - road racing questions are fun, someone should ask about fun strategies such as guttering the peloton or rolling attacks. </p>

"How to keep my testicles from freezing on a recumbent","8868","","<p>I wonder how to keep my testicles (plus part of the perineum) from freezing. I ride a recumbent, which is making it worse because it exposes those parts to the wind much more and I use unpadded tights (i.e. no isolation from the padding). I have seen the question about <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1623/finding-good-pants-for-winter-biking"">pants in general</a> but the problem is that those are overkill: expensive, hard to find, too warm (watertight but not breathable is not acceptable), not tight/aerodynamic or a combination thereof.</p>

<p>What I'm searching for is an additional layer to combine with my usual tights. I'm searching for solutions which are good in the -15°C to +10°C range where at the low end my legs would be comfortable in long tights and a long warm base layer and at the warm end short tights only.</p>

<p>This is my bike, if it's relevant:

<p>Clutter removed from central question text: I was cycling at ~+5°C in light rain wearing warm woolen socks, short tights, standard shirt, vest and summer gloves when this problem occurred to me. My testicles were uncomfortable during the ride, then briefly hurt a lot when warming up again back inside. I should have worn something to cover my ears, but apart from that and my testicles I was perfectly comfy - I'm an extreme cold weather person.</p>
","<p>(in short: best solution is in the first bullet point)</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of possibilities, as reflected by the myriad of different answers. Here is an attempt at summing them up together with my experiences with them (where available).</p>

<p>The problem appears when there is cold wind blowing on the scrotum+perineum and when they are wet and cooled by evaporation. If you are a women who wants to warm your corresponding area: I don't think this answer is actually too gender-specific if you mentally replace any references to male body parts. Should probably work for you too.</p>

<p>Just dressing other parts of the body warmer doesn't help. I tested this a couple of times and it really seems to be true. And it makes sense: heating the testicles (and torso in general) is a priority for the body, if that stops working then you have much bigger problems because you definitely have hypothermia.</p>

<p>So the solutions need to be about keeping the wind away from this specific area and keeping it dry.</p>

<p>The obvious luxury solution is the <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/50962/19881"">answer by Criggie</a>: Get a fairing. This keeps the wind away and if it's good the rain too (also: speeeeeeed :).</p>

<p>Other solutions work like an additional layer of clothing:</p>

<p>Inner layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jockstrap DIY (idea of jockstrap but without DIY mods by <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/50961/19881"">Tempus</a>): Jockstraps with removeable protective cups cost something like $10. You don't use the cup, but stuff the pocket with something suitable. I prefer a pair of summer sports boxers: they transfer humidity away very well and are fairly windtight when balled up enough. But other options include socks, <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/50957/19881"">bubble wrap</a>, <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/50974/19881"">newspapers</a>. The pocket obviously covers all of the scrotum, but part of the perineum which you might also want warmed stays exposed, you want to pull it to the back as far as possible (maybe even shorten the back straps). This works great! It feels a bit strange in the beginning, but I didn't notice any chafing so far. But it also completely disables the scrotum's cooling capabilities, so don't overdo it and only wear it while actually riding. You'll feel when it starts being too hot.</li>
<li>Any additional layer: Definitely helps a little, even if it's nothing specifically ""warm"". If you think you only need a little more then try wearing 2 or 3 pairs of your usual underwear (or if you usually don't wear any below tights: start to ;). Downside is that it covers too much and might make you sweat in other areas.</li>
<li>Fancy windtight boxers/briefs (as suggested by <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/50964/19881"">Rob</a>): They help. But most of them have only a small windproof part exactly in front of the genital area. This means the wind creeps around the sides, especially from below. Worst case, the wind blows straight <em>between</em> the windproof layer and your skin, coming from below. Usually it's not that bad though. Most should be comparable to wearing several layers of normal underwear, with the warming effect in <em>almost</em> the right place. But needs attention when choosing which to buy. If it's proper ""windproof"", i.e. breathable, you should choose the protected area as large as possible, they won't overheat you.</li>
<li>Padded bicycle pants (<a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/51015/19881"">Mark</a>): In the pad area, they are comparable to multiple layers of standard fabric, but wind tends to creep around the padded area. The padded area is located more to the back, so that all of the perineum and scrotum is warmed, but not necessarily all of the penis (so wrongly positioned towards the back instead of towards the front like the usual windtight boxers, but in my experience the latter is worse). Less warm than a stuffed jockstrap. Potential chafing would be about the same too (as in, I didn't experience any yet, but more than standard underwear). If you already have some, try them.</li>
<li>Women's pantyliners/pads: <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/51261/19881"">Willeke</a> mentioned their warming effect on women and I see no reason a man couldn't use them.</li>
<li>Duct tape on underwear (suggested by <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/51002/19881"">SeanM</a>): I haven't tried this, but based on experience with other methods I can confirm this very likely works fine, better than store bought windproof underwear where the windproof part isn't positioned and sized appropriately. It's messy though and just not worth the effort when the jockstrap method costs only $10.</li>
</ul>

<p>Outer layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic watertight tight trousers: They will keep wind and rain away, solving the acute problem. Some of them are even moderately aerodynamic although you would need to shop around. But they also keep sweat inside and will make your whole legs first wet and then cold in general (some have slits on the back to counteract this which is great on uprights but downright stupid on recumbents where the back is exposed to the wind too).</li>
<li>Fancy windtight tight trousers: Those are breathable and aerodynamic (because elastic and properly tight). Everything said about windproof underwear above applies, except that the protected area is usually larger. There is still often a gap between the end of the protected are and the seat through which wind attacks. In general they are super comfortable as an outer layer for terrible weather, but overly expensive and <em>not enough</em> for the genital area.</li>

"What is the benefit of Shimano Click'R technology?","8856","","<p>Im looking into making the switch from platforms to clip-less and just saw SPD pedals with ""Click'R"" technology ( <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00D85K5OA"">Example</a> ) Im not sure if its worth the extra money to buy that opposed to SPD pedals without the ""Click'r"" Technology. </p>

<p><strong>Has anyone tried both?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>

<p>This will also be my first ever pair of clip-less pedals so i prefer something beginner friendly which is what the ""click'r"" advertises </p>

<p>Just found this from the Shimano Website a great video Describing their Click'R Technology <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00D85K5OA"">Youtube</a></p>

<p>Their Website also has a great Diagram </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.shimano-lifestylegear.com/us/fw/technologies/clickr.php"">http://www.shimano-lifestylegear.com/us/fw/technologies/clickr.php</a></p>
","<p>Another option to that new system is the existing SPD system with the <a href=""http://www.shimano-lifestylegear.com/us/fw/products/accessory/cleat.php?pSccleat002"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Multi-Directional"" cleat (SM-SH56)</a>.  This cleat just makes the step-in and release a little easier than the standard cleat (no numbers on it).</p>

<p>The advantage (over the Click'R) is that it's using the tried-and-true SPD system, and when you get comfortable with that cleat, you can replace it with the standard cleat for a more secure connection.</p>

<p>The cleat may not be as recessed as the Click'R, but with standard MTB shoes there's usually enough shoe tread around the cleat to provide normal walking (I've never had a problem slipping on my cleat).</p>

"Are there pedals that are both flat and cleated on each side?","8795","","<p>I use the same bike for commuting, fast lunch-time rides, and not-very-fast weekend touring. I recently switched from flat pedals to clipless (Shimano PD-M520) but am finding them impractical on my commute - too much clipping in and out, for no obvious gain. I figure a good compromise would be pedals that are part-clipless, part-flat, but all the options I have come across so far (such as the Shimano M324) seem to be flat strictly on the one side and SPD strictly on the other, meaning I'll have to flip the pedal over even when wearing ordinary shoes. Is there a pedal that can be used as a flat pedal on <strong>both</strong> sides, and as an SPD ideally on both sides too but otherwise on just the one?</p>
","<p>I think the most approximate thing, at least on Shimano is the Shimano PD-M424, which is a clipless pedal with a resin cage, or the Shimano PD-M545 which is the same but with an alluminum cage.</p>

<p>I have been using these on MTB and commuting since year 2000 and I think they would fit your needs. The are easy to Clip In an out, but the cage provides very good support when used with regular shoes. I have commuted with those kind of pedals using Tennis shoes, flip-flops and even Office Shoes (with rubber soles). I have used hiking shoes to MTB with them and with good performance.</p>

<p>There are other similar like the Shimano PD-M647.</p>

<p>My father used them too with regular running shoes in light XC riding for years until I convinced him that platforms would be cheaper and more comfortable (He would never use clips).</p>

<p>The only care you must take for serious riding is that the shoe must have good sole texture, so it kind of grabs the center of the pedal and has good grip to the cage, because they are less safe than plain platform pedals.</p>

<p>Another Solution for you are these platforms that attach to the clipless mechanism, converting your regular clipless pedals into platforms. <a href=""http://problemsolversbike.com/products/deckster_clipless_pedal_adapter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://problemsolversbike.com/products/deckster_clipless_pedal_adapter</a>. You need to buy extra cleats because the platform adapter dos not include it. This kind of solution would be a little cumbersome as you would have to install the platforms for commuting days and remove them for performance riding.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that a skilled machinist with the right tools can craft a DIY version of these, that has a cleat-like shape incorporated so it has a flatter profile. (I have this project in my bucket list)</p>

<p>Finally a tip: your complaint about too much clipping/unclipping makes me think that it is (still) kind of difficult for you to do so, but it shouldn't. As you get more practice, clipping in and out becomes so natural that you won't be counting how many times you do it. Second, adjusting the mechanism tension to a lower setting makes it easier to pull out of it. Personally, I use mine in the lowest possible setting but I don't have unexpected  release issues, and I constantly lift the bike by pulling both pedals up.</p>

"How to convert a multi-speed bike to single-speed with coaster brake?","8783","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aUPYz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now I don't want to take all the credit for this bike, but I'm pretty sure Trek must've lovingly had me in mind when they made this. I mean come on. This bike is awesome. Buying their beach cruiser was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Now I've got my eye on this puppy.</p>

<p>So speaking of the beach cruiser, I really liked that it braked when you pedaled backward. I also liked the single gear splendor. I'd rather be climbing in a single gear at 3mph than zooming past all the ladies in top gear. More time to ask them whether you're supposed to floss before or after you brush. Just kidding. But seriously. The answer is <strong>after</strong>.</p>

<p>Back on point, can you modify a bike to be single gear and do that backward pedal brake thing? Think Trek would do this for me if I requested it with my order? How hard is it going to be to custom mod my rig with tools and stuff?</p>
","<p>The desired conversion is possible, but maybe Trek won't do it as a ""default"" service. You could consider going to the local bike shop and trade some of the bike parts (specially the gearing system) for a coaster brake wheel.</p>

<p>If your bike is like the one in the photo, you need to replace the rear hub, and get rid of the cogset, the derailer and the twist-shifter. You can do this at home if you have some mechanical skils, but replacing the hub and relacing the spokes is not very simple.</p>

<p>And if you're so chatty with the lovely ladies as you are when asking questions on the internet, they sure get a lot of talk! ;o)</p>

<p>EDIT: As Freiheit has correctly pointed, when you put a single cog and get rid of the derailer, something must be added to compensate for the almost inevitable chain slack. I suggest a tensioner like this, of DMR brand (with a bolt, to be placed in a fixed position, not a spring):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bGzqh.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>MORE EDIT!!!!
As people correctly pointed out, you CANNOT use a chain tensioner if you use a coaster brake. So the solutions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a chain tensioner but not a coaster brake;</li>
<li>Choose a magic combination of chainring and cog size (very difficult, might not give you a good gear ratio, cannot compensate for chain slack;</li>
<li>Use an adaptor (usually not the most robust solution, but ok for a cruiser if you really want the coaster brake):</li>

"Dealing with very juddery cantilever brakes","8757","","<p>I'm a commuter with a ~13m daily round-trip. I've been riding this on an MTB for 8 years, but I'm looking to upgrade. I recently tried out a 2012 model Specialized Tricross; this having been recommended as a road bike that retains the commuter niceties  (rack/mudguard mounts, etc) and can handle the light gravel tracks that form part of my route.</p>

<p>I love the bike, but I found one fundamental problem: The cantilever brakes set off this (initially) terrifying judder under pressure. On one downhill section, I couldn't brake enough to stop accelerating without this vibration running through the whole bike (and me), massively increasing my stopping distance. As a commuter in Oxford, being able to stop quickly and confidently is a must; something I've always been able to maintain with the V-brakes I'm used to. </p>

<p>Back at the shop I was told that the judder is something that all CX bikes share, and that it might have been accentuated by the fact I was on a fresh bike on wet roads.  I've also read that softer shoes and toeing in can help reduce the level of vibration, but that nothing can be done to remove it completely.</p>

<p>So, can anyone point out a way to address this? Is it something I'd simply have to get used to, or have I just picked the wrong kind of bike for my needs?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to 'grivooga' at Reddit (via Cyclo), this is an ideal description of the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What happened is that the fork blades and
  your headtube flexed. Just a little but enough to change the distance
  between the brake cable stop and the brake arms. This caused the
  brakes to pull harder. Something had to give, either the tire will
  skid, the brake pad will skip, or you'll go over the bars and crash.
  In this case the brake pad skipped on the rim. That released the
  pressure momentarily the frame and fork flexed back then the pad
  caught again and the process repeateded. The whole process happens
  very quickly, many times a second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll try one of the recommended fork-mounted hangers, along with some better toe-in and maybe softer compound pads. </p>

<p>The red circle shows roughly where the original hanger was situated. With the drop significantly reduced, all I feel now is the occasional soft vibration, and only when I lean fairly hard on the front brake. Enough of an improvement that I bought the bike. </p>

<p>So I bought small and medium and settled for the small but even that is quite loose on me and a baggy fit. It certainly keeps me warm, no complaints there, but then I very quickly get too warm. They're supposed to be magic - keep you warm in winter and cool in the heat - but if it can't stop me from overheating when its cold outside, I struggle to believe it being any better in the summer.</p>

<p>My theory is that it needs to be a skin fit in order to achieve its wicking capabilities, and because it's loose, it isn't able to wick the heat direct from my skin, but rather heats up the air between my skin and the base layer causing a reserve of hot air which keeps getting hotter and thus causing my own mini personal sauna effect. </p>

<p>Am I right or totally wrong? I don't mind being wrong, but just want to understand the reasons I seem to be too hot and what I can do to resolve it.</p>

<p>I am also wearing a waterproof jacket over it which isn't very breathable. This could just as much be the problem, but I don't want to leave the jacket in case it rains as I don't know how Merino wool base layers - especially when baggy - cope when wet? (Another question maybe?)</p>

<p>Well there's your problem. </p>

<p>The most wickable, breathable material in the world isn't going to achieve those properties if you put a plastic bag over it. If you don't want to be caught out in the rain, keep the raincoat in a backpack/messengerbag/pannier/whatever until it's needed.</p>

<p>Regarding how tight the base layer should be, I would say it should be pretty tight, especially when you first put it on because it will shrink up in the wash and loosen up considerably when you sweat in it. However, if it's a little baggy it's not the end of the world, it just wont wick moisture away as well.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that everyone has different heat/cold tolerances. Two different people may require entirely different layers at the same temperature based on exertion, weight, preference, etc. If you're a hot blooded type, it might need to get a little colder before you put on a wool jersey.

<p>Edit: Do the R1 and the R3 fit the same?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
","<p><strong>Updated after a week of use:</strong></p>

<p>I recently purchased the R1 from a local bike shop. Summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's the most comfortable shoe I've worn (which isn't many).</li>
<li>The R1 especially needs a bit of wearing in to reshape the leather and custom Sidas insert to the shape of your specific foot.</li>
<li>The included insert is rather extreme and may be initially painful but quickly reshapes to the shape of your foot after a few hours of use. I tried my own Superfeet inserts but went back to the one that ships with the shoe.</li>
<li>The shoe has several minor adjustments that can be made (tongue padding, straps, insert).</li>
<li>There are several form-fitting features that really grip the foot in a comfortable way (especially the heel).</li>
<li>Subjectively, they perform really well. There's the sensation that all foot movement goes right to the pedals and into pure speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Detail:</p>

<p>The local bike shop had the R3 in stock. I tried their largest size (44.5) and they felt about right, so I ordered the R1 in the hope that they would fit the same. I wish they had the 45 to compare, but I went with the 44.5 anyway.</p>

<p>I received the R1 a few days later and they seemed a bit tighter than the R3, especially in length. However, I'm told this is intentional since the R1 is all kangaroo leather and will stretch a bit.</p>

<p>They immediately felt really comfortable for my foot. Bike shoes are hard to review since foot shapes and sizes are different for everyone. The built-in arch support is very tall at first, but quickly changes to fit your specific foot. I didn't use any heat treatment other than just wearing the shoe on a few rides.</p>

<p>I did a 50km ride and felt great, then (possibly unwisely) a 250km ultramarathon (with 3km of vertical over three mountain passes). Other than a preexisting issue with a bone in my right pinky toe, the shoes were extremely comfortable and performed very well. I was very happy to be in this shoe.</p>

<p>Sizing is tricky. The R3 is a bit longer than the R1 since it's not made to stretch at all. The R1 is supposed to stretch a bit in both length and toebox width over the first few weeks of use.</p>

<p>Apparently they run big, maybe even a full size big compared to Sidi. I wear a 45 in Sidi and the 44.5 in Fizik was comfortable for me.</p>

<p>The grip that this shoe has on the heel is incredibly firm without being uncomfortable. I find that I can leave the straps fairly loose and still get good power on the pedals throughout the full stroke.</p>

<p>They were very squeaky at first with my Speedplay pedals, but a bit of Carbon paste between the cleat and shoe eliminated all squeaks.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm very happy with this shoe. I plan to use them for 5-10 years, so the price was well worth it for me. It's probably almost impossible to try the R1 in a store (they won't stock it), but you may be able to find an R3 to try on.</p>

<p>So I was wondering, is there anything such as a break-in period for brakes?
Is there something specific I should/should not do?
Is there something specific I should/should not verify to find whether my set-up is right or not?</p>
","<p>Disc brakes, both mechanical and hydraulic, require the pads to be bedded in before they reach optimal performance. There are many different views to the best way to do this but manufactuer instructions generally revolve around several start/stops increasing the pressure on each stop to build up heat and speed up the process. </p>

<p>I personally don't do anything special and just use the brakes just bearing in mind that they are bedding in (ie. no hard braking into a tight corner) until I have the feel of them and are willing to trust them.</p>

<p>Here is the Avid bed-in procedure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>warning:  the bed-in process requires you to perform
  heavy braking.  you must be familiar with the power
  and operation of disc brakes.  braking heavily when
  not familiar with the power and operation of disc
  brakes could cause you to lose control of your bicycle 
  which could lead to a crash which could lead to 
  serious injury and/or death.  if you are unfamiliar with
  the power and operation of disc brakes you should
  have the bed-in process performed by a qualified
  bicycle mechanic. then you should [practice your
  riding and braking techniques on a flat and level
  surface prior to aggressive riding]. 
  to  safely  achieve  optimal  results, remain seated on the bike during the entire bed-in procedure.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Accelerate the bike to a moderate speed<br>
  (approximately 19 kilometers or 12 miles per
  hour), then firmly apply the brakes until you are
  at walking speed.  Repeat approximately twenty
  times.</p></li>
  <li><p>Accelerate the bike to a faster speed<br>
  (approximately 32 kilometers or 20 miles per
  hour).  Then very firmly and suddenly apply the
  brakes until you are at walking speed.  Repeat 
  approximately ten times.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>important: do not lock the wheels up at any point during the bed-in procedure.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Allow the brakes to cool prior to any additional riding.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>this concludes the disc brake pad and rotor bedding in procedure. you did a great job! you are now ready to ride. enjoy!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other set up to check on mechanical disc brakes is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check the caliper centered, loosen up the mounting bolts and spin the wheel. Pull the brakes tightly and while holding the brake on redo up the mounting bolts.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the gap between pad and rotor, with a mechanical disc brake this is a manual exercise and different to hydraulics. Each brake will have a different method here is a link for <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/avid-reg-mechanical-disc-adjustment"">BB7s</a>.

","<p>There's not a set, single tension that works for all bikes. It's just trial and error. </p>

<p>You need to pull it pretty tight before clamping it to the derailleur. Probably as tight as you can. Usually I find that's still not tight enough, so I screw the barrel adjuster down all the way before putting the cable in and then open it up until the tension is correct. </p>

<p>Assuming that you do in fact have everything else set up correctly: if the derailleur is rubbing on the outside of the chain, you need a little more tension. If it's rubbing on the inside, you need a little less. </p>

<p>Also, if you've swapped any parts out, you may be having some compatibility issues. Derailleurs have minimum and maximum chainring sizes. If you're just a smidge over or under those sizes, you're almost sure to get some rubbing.</p>

"Why are bicycles considered vehicles and not ""walking aid""?","8673","","<p><a href=""http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2012/01/how-cars-can-be-nice-to-cyclists/"">The Bicycles.SE blog</a> states ""Cyclists are vehicles, not pedestrians."". I think most of this community, plus most of the laws agree with that.</p>

<p>However, a cyclist has the speed, mass and maneuverability of a sprinting person (who is, of course, a pedestrian).</p>

<p><strong>Why are bicycle riders considered vehicles and not pedestrians?</strong></p>
","<p>Traffic law (in the US):  The law considers the bicycle, first and foremost, to be a mode of transport, and sees a need to regulate the flow of bikes the way it regulates the flow of automobiles.  This dates back to the dawn of automobiles, if not before (though in some states it took decades for the law to spell things out as it does).  This makes sense, since bicycles can attain speeds well in excess of a normal pedestrian and their speed creates hazards for both them and pedestrians if they ride on sidewalks or otherwise behave as pedestrians.</p>

<p>Besides, if bicycles were pedestrians we'd not be allowed on roads, in the flow of traffic.  This would place a major constraint on cycling few of us would want to see.</p>

<p>I believe most states have an exclusion of sorts for children on bikes or maybe even for adults riding at low speed, allowing them to use (most) pedestrian paths.  But this is an exception to the general rule.</p>

<p>There is a problem that a significant fraction of the general public does not tend to view bicycles as vehicles, but this is an education problem, and I'd definitely not want to confuse the issue by raising the above question ""in public"".</p>

<p>(I am reminded, however, of ""Big Lip Louie"", a guy who lived in rural Louisville, KY 50 years ago when I was a kid.  He was, at the time, maybe 30-40, and didn't drive, but walked everywhere.  He was tall -- well over 6 feet -- with long legs, and could walk at speeds I'd guess were in excess of 10 MPH.  It was fairly common to encounter him walking along a rural road, pretty much right down the center of the road.  He was more of a ""vehicle"" than a pedestrian.)</p>

<p>This is an old bike, but until last 4 or 5 months I only had to tighten that nut once a month or even less often. Now it's much worse and getting worse with time.</p>

<p>I have marked one of nut's sides to determine if the metal ""foot"" started to wear out quickly or the nut is somehow loosened moving down the screw.

<p>To be honest I don't understand the mechanics of this process (what makes it to unscrew) and wonder if this is something I can fix or I'll need a new handle post soon.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>As with any critical fastener on a bike, the vibration and flexing forces from riding will eventually work threaded parts loose. Normally this is the sort of thing that occurs over a few months--not every week. Fortunately, there are a few options that are applicable to this and any other situation where threads work themselves loose. (Before you do anything, though, make sure that the rest of your steering components are safely adjusted.)</p>

<p>The easiest thing would be to buy a tube of Loctite (or comparable) thread locking compound. It is cheap and easy to find. You'll want to get a formula that isn't permanent so that you can make adjustments down the road. Back the nut off until you see some threads and add one or two drops those threads. Adjust the tension where it needs to be and let it sit for a little while. (Loctite is safe for threads mostly everywhere on a bike!) In less critical applications, beeswax is a great natural compound for securing threads and preventing corrosion.</p>

<p>A second option would be to replace your 10mm nut with a lock nut. These are nuts with a nylon (or similar) insert in the aft part of the threads which prevents it from working loose. Similarly, you could procure a lock washer which will prevent the nut from backing out when tightened properly. (It doesn't look like you have enough space for it, but a second nut behind your primary nut (called a jam nut) will keep the adjustment stable as well. Jam nuts are typically narrower than a standard nut so they use less threaded area.) Any well-stocked hardware store will have suitable metric hardware. </p>

<p>If those options fail you, you may need to take more permanent action. Either chemically (with a permanent thread locking solution), or mechanically by installing a castle nut. A castle nut has notches along one side to mesh with wire or a cotter pin that is drilled through the threaded bolt. The wire prevents the nut from backing off, but the downside is that this requires drilling a tiny hole straight through the bolt (which would require you use a drill press and lots of diligence). I really don't think you'll have to resort to this last option, but it works.</p>

<p>In any case, continue to be vigilant in inspecting those parts for wear and adjustment. </p>

"What should I expect from a bicycle service?","8633","","<p>I'm thinking about getting my bicycle serviced for the first time to make sure it's entirely roadworthy.  </p>

<p>My question is what should I expect from a bike service from a professional?</p>

<p>i.e. what checks are carried out, what maintenance is done, to what price level will parts be replaced within the service price?</p>

<p>And finally what price should I be paying for a service? (London UK)</p>

<p>EDIT: I'll further add there might be a minor problem with my back dérailleur, no parts needed to fix, just the know how... </p>
","<p>These services vary wildly from shop to shop. </p>

<p>My local shop will look at any bike and tell the owner if it's safe to ride. And of course, they'll tell the owner how much it would cost to make it safe if it's not already. They're pretty honest about it, but of course I can't guarantee that other places are.</p>

<p>Most shops offer a free ""tune-up"" with the purchase of a new bike. This usually includes minor maintenance and inspections such as tightening bolts, airing up tires, adjusting brake and derailleur cable tightness, checking that the wheels are true, etc., but no parts replacement. If the bike was not purchased from the shop in question, they will usually offer the same tune-up service for a relatively low fee, $25 (~£16) US where I live.</p>

<p>Many shops offer additional service levels beyond this. They may include replacing cables and/or cable housing, bar tape, brake pads, actually truing the wheels (this can be a more time consuming job and may not be included in a basic tune-up), and perhaps even a bike wash. These tune-ups can get fairly expensive, $100-$150 (£67-£100) US. </p>

<p>Exactly how much you pay for any tune-up will depend on exactly what combination of services a shop offers and the amount of local competition, so you should really shop around. </p>

"Cycling uphill on a road - sitting or standing on pedals?","8624","","<p>When cycling uphill on a road, what are the pros and cons of cycling while standing up on pedal versus sitting on saddle?</p>
","<p>You're most efficient sitting with a cadence between 80 - 100 (faster if you can do it) so it's recommended that you stay seated as much as possible. For mountain biking staying seated increases the weight on your rear tire and reduces the chances of it slipping as long as you can keep a smooth spin stroke and not 'mash' the pedals on the down stroke.</p>

<p>Standing is harder on your body but in long climbs it's great to switch it up so that you move some of the force around your muscles and give them a break. Standing is also great to get you up that 'really steep' part of a climb or to sprint over the top and lose your friends (or win a race). </p>

<p>As stated above stay seated with a high cadence for as long as possible. Switch up to standing as needed to give yourself a break or an extra boost of power.</p>

"What things should I look for when purchasing a fixed gear bike?","8624","","<p>What features are important or of note? What are appropriate prices to pay? Are there specific brands which provide a clear advantage over others?</p>
","<p>You are likely going to get some opinionated comments and answers in response to this question.  There are lots of good brands (frames and complete bikes) from all over the world.  There are more and more options showing up in local bike stores, so if you can it will be best to go have a look.  Even if you choose to purchase online, having spent some time looking at physical hardware will help you make your decision.</p>

<p>I'm going to make an assumption that you're asking about a fixed gear bicycle for road use as opposed to a track.</p>

<p>If you haven't read <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/fixed.html"">Sheldon Brown's detailed article</a> then please do, it's a great place to start.  Without reiterating all of the detail in that article I'll simply point out a couple of highlights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The number one thing that you should look for is a brake.  Again, others may offer dissenting opinions on this, but riding a fixed gear bicycle on the road without a brake is extremely dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p>Chain tension mechanism.  You will have to be able to tension the chain on your fixed gear bike as it lacks the derailleur and pulley mechanism that handles that task on traditional geared bikes.  This will likely be accomplished by means of horizontal rear wheel dropouts within which the wheel moves back and forth for adjustment.  You may also encounter models with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_bracket#Eccentric_bottom_brackets"">eccentric bottom bracket</a> mechanism.  These typically add some weight and may be of less interest to you unless you happen to go for a rear disk brake (in which case moving the rear wheel to adjust chain tension is not an option)</p></li>
<li><p>If you are new to the world of fixed gears then you may be interested in having an option to run a freewheel as well.  A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_hub"">flip-flop hub</a> can offer the best of both worlds in that you can ride fixed or flip the wheel around and ride with a freewheel.  This adds a small weight penalty and absolutely requires that you install a brake of course.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for price, brands, geometries, gear ratios, frame materials etc. this is very much personal preference and the rules are the same as for any bicycle.  You can typically splurge a little on a fixie because there are far fewer other components that you have to purchase and maintain.</p>

<p><strong>Solved</strong>:
Took out the bottom bracket.  It is fine and so are the cranks. The threads on the frame are not fine though. I need a new frame :P</p>
","<p>Here's a quick test. Grab the crank arm that you say is moving and wiggle it. Does the arm on the other side move? If so, you've probably got a bottom bracket problem. The answer then depends on whether you have a sealed or loose bearing botton bracket. As mentioned previously, a sealed shouldn't do this after 2600 miles. (Neither should a loose bearing, but it is more likely).</p>

<p>If the other arm is not moving, then the one wiggling is probably coming off of the bottom bracket spindle (the axle). The spindle may be rounded off, or the crank arm may be rounded off. The only way to really tell is to take it off and see. This probably means that it wasn't installed securely in the first place.</p>

"Metal seat post with carbon fiber frame?","8510","","<p>Is using a metal seat post on a carbon fiber frame advisable or not? I want to use a seat post mounted rack on my road bike (no regular rack mount points are on this bike), but I have been told that is not a good idea for carbon seat posts. So I thought I get a whole new metal post &amp; saddle and swap the posts as necessary for commuting versus recreation.</p>

<p>I ask primarily because the famous Sheldon Brown once wrote on his site ""Using a carbon-fiber seatpost in a metal frame, or vice versa, invites problems."" but didn't explain why.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
","<p>It's likely that Sheldon's concern was for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion"" rel=""nofollow"">galvanic corrosion</a> between carbon fiber and aluminum.

In essence, in the presence of an electrolyte (sea air, your sweat) and a cathode (carbon fiber-embedded resin) the anode (aluminum) will corrode.  In the case of a seatpost/seattube interface, this corrosion will wedge the seatpost in place.  This can, at best, make it extremely hard to remove the seatpost.  At worst, it can render the frame unusable.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to check to see if your frame was built with an aluminum insert for the seat tube.  Given that you currently have a carbon seatpost this is unlikely, but it would alleviate the main concern.</p>

<p>If that's not the case, there are still some precautions you can take. As <a href=""http://www.calfeedesign.com/tech-papers/technical-white-paper/#whitepapericon"" rel=""nofollow"">Calfee</a> notes, anodization will provide some protection.  As well, regular removal and cleaning and reinstallation with carbon paste can help prevent excessive buildup.</p>

<p>On the significantly more expensive side, you could also consider a titanium seatpost, which wouldn't corrode.</p>

","<p>The main reason that aerobars may have an advantage over flat or road bars is that they are designed so that your main support mechanism is skeletal, rather than muscular. The longer the distance, the more this will hold true.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsKoZ.gif"" alt=""Normann Stadler""></p>

<p>This picture is of a top triathlete. Note that the forearms are almost parallel, and the upper arms are at a 90 degree angle. This allows the main support for the upper body to rest on the bone structure, with minimal muscle involvement. (Stadler was an Ironman distance triathlete, bike segment of 112 miles). </p>

<p>While you may see variations on this, it is a general truism that the longer the race, the more comfort trumps aerodynamics, and vice versa (Short races aerodynamics trumps comfort.)</p>

<p>Many of the ultra mountain bike competitors set up their rides similarly, and have ""wrap"" style aerobars that allow them multiple different hand positions for control, as well as the resting position where their arm muscles don't have to do the work for support.</p>

<p>That all being said, I would point out that many riders go much further than 40 miles with no pain at all. This would suggest to me that your fit is not correct, or that you are not in shape enough for a 40 mile ride yet. Tailbone pain is (usually) a bad saddle and fit, and the rest is also easily attributable to fit. Aerobars will not be a magic cureall for an improperly fitted bike</p>

<p>There are lots of different devices on the market, but a quick look on Strava's own store has highlighted the Wahoo RFLKT which connects to your smart phone. Without a connection to your smart phone, the Wahoo is essentially useless. However, it would appear to be quite good as it allows a direct connection with your Strava app (displaying data that the app outputs), only costs $99 and then you have the piece of mind that your data will ultimately end up in Strava as soon as you finish your ride. This again has it's own cons as you need to use your phone as the main cycle computer, ultimately draining your battery quite rapidly.</p>

<p>It then really comes down to an argument of which appears more useful. A standalone bike computer with the ability to auto-upload when paired with a mobile phone, or a computer which simply displays data outputted by the Strava app at the sacrifice of your phone's battery life.</p>

The problem is, the diameter is often not the same. Around the same time as the threadless forks were introduced, they started making the steering tubes and head tubes thicker. The old ones were typically 1 inch (that's the steering tube outer diameter). The new ones are 1.125"", sometimes 1.5"".</p>

"How do I clean my bike in winter?","8412","","<p>How or where do I clean my bike in winter?</p>

<p>I live in Michigan, USA and winter can be very harsh, along with the added salt used for ice removal.  I am not commuting or anything, just occasionally riding for fun.</p>

<p>Not cleaning my bike after a ride does not really seem like a good idea, so I would assume this would be a common issue.</p>

<p>I tried just using hot water, but it is punishingly cold and difficult.  Maybe it just one of those ""suck it up"" type things?</p>

<p>Here is a somewhat <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2705/how-should-i-clean-salt-out-during-winters"">related question</a>, but more about chain cleaning.</p>
","<p>I've found the simplest way is to get it rinsed off outside if you can, buckets of warm/hot water work well, then bring it inside and wash in the tub. If you've got a garage or laundry room, this becomes even easier by basically sponge-bathing your bike with a rag.</p>

<p>Another alternative, but sometimes less worth it, is to take the bike to a self-wash car wash and spray it down on the low pressure setting and scrub it down there. Some washes have doors you can close to keep it a little warmer.</p>

"Why offset the rear rim to the hub and not the hub in the frame?","8400","","<p>I'm currently reading <a href=""http://www.icelord.net/bike/thebicyclewheel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Bicycle Wheel</a> by Jobst Brandt, and I'm reading all of the issues with offsetting the rear rim toward the drive side of the hub...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Asymmetry in a rear wheel built for a multispeed gear cluster makes it weaker
  against side loads coming from the right side. This means that the wheel bends
  to the left more easily than the right. The greater the offset, the weaker the
  wheel. In order to reduce offset for six-, seven- and eight-speed clusters, hubs
  have been built with narrower flange spacing. Although they reduce the
  disparity in tension between left-side and right-side spokes, they weaken the
  wheel against lateral forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I'm curious, why is it the standard to do so? Why not center the rim to the hub just like the front, and then offset the frame's drive side rear triangle to accomodate the difference? It may shift the chain line a bit, but this doesn't seem like anything that challenging to adjust for. The strength and durability benefits are huge, and the only downside I can see is that you couldn't arbitrarily change rear hub widths (not that it seems they change that often anyway), or you may have to introduce the offset again. Why don't bicycle manufacturers start doing this instead? Do they make frames that you can use a rear wheel built with the rim centered on the rear hub?</p>

<p><strong>Rear Wheel Offset --></strong>
<img src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12U2yyNOfC8/SVBBbkrTChI/AAAAAAAAACk/qws7HSe5ZUA/s400/offset.jpg"" alt=""Rear Wheel Offset""></p>
","<p>The biggest functional reason actually would be chain line. </p>

<p>You could make the hub shell wider, and run an offset dropout to allow the space for the gears, but then you would have to run a similar offset on the bottom bracket to maintain a usable chain line.</p>

<p>Running the offset on the bottom bracket would affect Q factor positioning on many riders, and while some riders like or need additional stance width, most do not.</p>

<p>Because a change like this requires such a radical redesign of pretty much every bicycle component, it would require a consensus from the entire range of bike manufacturers to be put into practical or wide spread use.</p>

<p>So you could call it tradition, but I think momentum would be more accurate. The existing body of design work would need to radically change to accommodate something like this, and that is a lot of ""mass"" to shift. </p>

<p>Since existing wheel structures and designs are working for riders as is, most companies choose to stay within the range of difference that allows the bike frame and other component designs to be affected as little as possible.</p>

<p>After all, there is no guarantee that an offset design would work in practice, and the benefit to it isn't major, given that existing designs work.</p>

"Netherlands: where to buy cheap bikes? (Police autions, cheapest towns)","8353","","<p>We are a french couple visiting the Netherlands (starting tomorrow) by bike. We have few questions: </p>

<li><p>we heard about police bike auction but according to some website it seems reserved to the community or people whose bike was stollen, at least in Amsterdam and Hardenberg (which is understandable).

We did try googleing this ""Fietsenverkoop bij politie + city-name"" (translate with google translate) but we didn't find any info except for the auction in Amsterdam, Hardenberg (where being french resident we can't go), and Groningen (the next auction is too late for us)? Are there other keywords we could use?</p></li>
<li><p>what should we do if we find a good bike (not suspiciously cheap and from a private person : we found out about marktplaatz) without any serial number on it (in France there is no identification number on bike so we don't do if it's mandatory in netherlands to have a serial number, or if all the bikes have one). Is there a way to ensure it's not stolen? Would a photo of the ID card + the address of the seller will be enough?</p></li>
<li><p>are bikes cheaper in Belgium ?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help! </p>
","<p>There are several places to avoid if you are looking for a cheap bike, and several places to seek.</p>

<p>First to avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generally bikes tend to be pricier / lower quality in all towns with a big university because demand is high and many bikes are ""consumed"" by the buyer. Lots of exchange students buy a bike and discard it after a year rather than resell it, and most other students use their bike untill it falls apart with as little maintenance as possible and discard the wreck. So you're less likely to find a good value bike here: Groningen, Enschede, Wageningen, Utrecht, Amsterdam, Nijmegen, Maastricht, Eindhoven, Tilburg, Delft, Leiden.</li>
<li>Regular bicycle shops (they usually charge a high markup for secondhand bikes).</li>
</ul>

<p>What to seek out:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a counterpoint to the point about university towns above: in many of these university towns you get people who collect the wrecks and combine them into working bikes that they sell for a nice price. You'll find these people through marktplaats and they offer reasonably priced bikes.</li>
<li>the ""Kringloopwinkel"" or ""tweedehands winkel"" in whichever town you select (second hand store). They are quite often the party that receives ""left over"" bikes from the police and bikes removed for being ""in the way"" (which I explained in my answer to <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/24452/where-to-park-a-bike-during-a-year-for-free-in-the-netherlands"">your previous question</a>)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.marktplaats.nl/c/fietsen-en-brommers/c445.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.marktplaats.nl</a> (with an ""s"") is a good source of cheap secondhand bikes. There is no requirement for serial numbers on bikes though insurance companies sometimes require it. You should probably go with your gut feeling when going this route, I think legal sales are the norm there though. You can do two things to improve your odds of staying on the right side of the law:

<ol>
<li>Check other ads on marktplaats from the same seller, check how long they have been a user on marktplaats longtime users are less likely to be fraudulent.</li>
<li>Dutch police has a <a href=""https://www.mijnpolitie.nl/b/miocheck2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tool to find ""suspect"" sellers</a>. Fill in the sellers' username and/or e-mail address there to check if ""reports"" have been filed about that user (bikes are in the category ""overig"").</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>As to your final question: I think the dutch market for secondhand bikes is very liquid and very large. My gut feeling tells me secondhand bikes will be better value in the Netherlands but I never tried buying a secondhand bike in Belgium.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of panniers vs messenger bags?","8351","","<p>I was shopping for new panniers and thought it might be worth it to also check out messenger bags as an alternative.  What are the basic pros and cons of each?</p>

<p>I started out using just a regular back pack to carry my stuff, this was quite hot on my back.  I purchased panniers a few years back, and I've been pretty happy with them.</p>

<p>The major problems I have are that the rack is always on the bike, even when I don't need to carry anything.  They are difficult to carry when I'm not on the bike.  Also, most panniers are sold in sets of 2, and I only ever use 1. </p>

<p>As far as messenger bags go, I've never used one before.  Is it that much better than a regular back pack?  I realize it isn't so high on the back, so it should stay cooler, but I'm not sure about having all the weight on me, and how that affects getting out of the saddle. </p>

<p>Let me know what your experiences are with each of them, and which you recommend.</p>
","<p>Messenger bags still get your back sweaty, sometimes even moreso than a backpack since messenger bags are often wider than a backpack. I find a messenger bag more convenient than a backpack for shorter trips, but a pannier better for rides of greater than a mile or two. A messenger bag is quite handy if you have to make a lot of stops and don't have a lot to carry. </p>

<p>I often get back pain if I carry my messenger bag for any length of time. </p>

<p>When carrying a messenger bag with netbook and a book or two, I'm hesitant to rise up out of the saddle. Panniers can actually make a bike a bit more stable, if the weight is carried low to the ground. (The only time I can stand out of the pedals while climbing is on a loaded touring bike, but that's an extreme situation.) </p>

<p>My MO is to use what's appropriate to the trip. If I'm riding downtown to get some work done in a cafe with a laptop, I'll most likely take the messenger bag, but if I need to carry stiff for a longer ride, I'll use a couple of panniers. </p>

<p>I've sometimes used one pannier, if the load isn't too heavy. You can also distribute a light load between two panniers. (That's a good use of front panniers, which, depending on the bike, can be more stable that rear panniers.) </p>

<p>There are options for panniers that need to be carried around a lot. This question and its answers address that well: <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/762/recommendation-for-panniers-used-off-the-bike-a-lot"">Recommendation for panniers used off the bike a lot</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, the choice of pannier-vs-messenger bag/backpack is a false choice. Both are tools, and you can use what's appropriate to the job at hand. </p>

<p>I'm asking this because lately my RS Revelation (1yo) seems stiff. I checked the sag and found I should increase it... so I did, but it's still using almost the same amount of travel (I check the o-ring at the end of a ride). Moreover, on rough terrain (gravel), I feel an incredible amount of vibrations that hurt my fingers.</p>

<p>Are these the signs? (in other words: will an oil change solve these problems?)</p>
","<p>Over time forks become less responsive (move slower basically), but as this effect happens over the course of 12-18 months (the usual fork oil and seal lifetime), it's difficult to notice as you just get used to it.  So most fork manufacturers tell you to change it after so many miles.</p>

<p>This responsiveness loss happens for a couple of reasons on different types of damping systems, on mine (Boxxers) it's because of pollutants in the oil itself - 'dust' from the bushes, dirt, seal flake off, etc.</p>

<p>You can get a rough idea of the state of your fork oil just by looking at it, new stuff is clear tinted yellow.  I've seen fork oil come out looking like mercury from the sheer quantity of bushing dust in it...</p>

<p>Technically you only need to change seals once they start leaking oil, but of course that usually means that they've already failed their job - if you ride a lot in dirty conditions (which you should be!) they want changing every year.</p>

<p>Bushes only need changing once there's excessive play between your stanchions and sliders, this usually takes years but you can test the same way you would for testing a headset.</p>

<p>Does anyone know anything about this mysterious Giant hub? Could it be a culprit as the Formula hub gives better roll?
Are there any other suggestions how to make Anyroad roll better?</p>
","<p>Running both tires at the same PSI could be your problem.  In a comment you stated you are running both at 70 PSI. </p>

<p>Tires of different width will typically have different design pressures.  Larger tires run at lower pressure.  Run both tires at the max pressure for <em>that</em> tire.  On the sidewall will be an operating pressure range for <em>that</em> tire. Run both tires at the maximum for <em>that</em> tire.</p>

<p>If you are running both tires at the same pressure you are penalizing the smaller tire that is designed to run at a higher pressure.  </p>

<p>The size of the contact patch is PSI times weight.  So if you have 140 lbs on the tire at 70 psi the contact patch is 2 square inches.  The more narrow tires must have a longer contact path to achieve that same 2 square inches.  The more narrow tire must deform more.  That deformation is rolling resistance.  More deformation is more rolling resistance.</p>

"I wish to get fit, therefore should I have a heavy bike?","8331","","<p>A lot of people seem take up cycling to get fit, and they'll talk about how light their bikes are.  </p>

<p>However, as I understand it, a heavy bike uses more energy to pedal it. Should someone that wished to get fit find a very heavy bike?</p>
","<p>I'm going to assume that your definition of ""get fit"" is to lose weight and develop aerobic fitness. I'm also going to assume that the person in question is rather unfit to begin with.</p>

<p>All in all, a person can get fit (or not) on either a heavy or light bike; it will really depend on how they go about their fitness program. </p>

<p>To achieve aerobic or cardiovascular fitness one needs to engage in an activity that elevates the heart rate to a target zone and keep it there for periods of time. To lose weight, one must burn more energy (calories) than one consumes. In order to do this the activity needs to be done on a regular basis. </p>

<p>On to the weight of the bike... Say a person can choose either a 15lb road bike, a 25lb mountain bike, or a 35lb commuter bike for their fitness program. It makes absolutely no difference which bike they choose in order to lose weight and develop aerobic fitness. The only thing that matters will be how they use the bike. So to get fit, the choice of bike would depend more on the type of use a person desires rather than the weight of the bike.</p>

<p>There are also drawbacks to choosing a heavier bike for the sake of it being heavier. One is that it would be harder on the knees of an unfit person, and even a fit person, if they have to climb hills. Another is that it's just plain harder to have to lug around. And also, it would be much less enjoyable once the person gets fit.</p>

<p>My second job is working as a fitness trainer. If a client came to me wanting to get fit with cycling, I <em>would not</em> recommend that they get a 'heavy' bike. I <em>would recommend that they get the best bike they can reasonably afford, based on the type of riding that they prefer to do.</em> I would also probably recommend that they start out with steady, regular riding and build up to interval training. <em>The question is about getting a heavy bike for fitness; and I'd say no, don't get a heavy bike for fitness. Get a bike that will be frequently ridden.</em></p>

<p>As a trainer I've had several clients who turned to cycling for fitness reasons. One of them got an 'urban' bike decked out with fenders, rear rack, panniers, etc and proceeded to lose 30lbs and otherwise improve her fitness with a daily 16 mile RT commute, plus weekend fun rides. Another client went with an expensive, light road bike; he managed to burn off 25lbs, and 6 months later rode his first century. So, the weight of the bike shouldn't be the determining factor. Like others have said, it should be about the fun and enjoyment and finding a style of riding that'll be sustained. </p>

"Is it possible/worth it to replace just shifters and derailleurs on an older MTB?","8291","","<p>I have an aluminum frame bicycle (mountain bike, 21-speed) that I purchased some time in the late 90s, it's marked ""Skykomish Eureka"" (though I can't find any evidence that such a brand and model ever existed), and it is currently outfitted with Shimano 300LX components.</p>

<p>I believe that the rear shifter is giving up the ghost, as sometimes the lower (up) handle will go all the way back without ""catching"" whatever it's supposed to be catching in order to shift the gears.</p>

<p>I toyed with the idea some time ago of replacing the components with something more upscale (back then, it would've been Shimano EX, I guess...), but I never did it. Now, I'm wondering whether it's worth the effort. I put several hundred dollars into this bicycle back then, so I'm confident it's not merely a BSO, but technology has come quite a way since those days.</p>

<p>Beyond the basic components (hopefully just a couple derailleurs and shifters), would it also be possible to replace the existing short-arm cantilever brakes with the newer long-arm type (which I assume would increase braking power)?</p>
","<p>The great thing about bikes is that almost anything is possible for the home mechanic. But only you can answer the question of whether it's worth it. </p>

<p>Deraillers almost never ""wear out"", at most they need new jockey wheels. They can get damaged or bent, often is is the hanger that is bent not the derailluer. </p>

<p>So likely all you need is a new shifter, fortunately 7spd is a lot less complicated than bikes with more speeds. $17 for a new shifter </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jensonusa.com/!q!CCO3MwJWuenvYwhoKCsA!/Shimano-M310-Shift-Lever?utm_source=FRGL&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;gclid=CPby-unl0sMCFRRgfgodc0YAoQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jensonusa.com/!q!CCO3MwJWuenvYwhoKCsA!/Shimano-M310-Shift-Lever?utm_source=FRGL&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;gclid=CPby-unl0sMCFRRgfgodc0YAoQ</a></p>

<p>Or you could put friction shifters on for a little more cash. </p>

<p>What does get worn out is the rear cogs or cassette. You might need a cassette
and chain. That's about $50 more or less. </p>

<p>You can put new canti's on there without changing the levers, if you go to V-brakes you'll need new levers. Generally getting good performance out of canti's has more to do with how well you set them up rather than the exact model you use. </p>

<p>So for roughly $100-$200 in parts, you can have a functional bike again. However, if you can't do the work yourself, paying someone else to do it is a long ways towards the price of a new bike. This also assumes you already have the tools ( although these repairs don't require much in the way of specialized tools. ) </p>

<p>For roughly 3x what you'd spend in parts, you can get a lightly used MTB hardtail that will be a much nicer bike. If however, you enjoy tinkering around with bikes, then you really aren't concerned about the cost of parts. </p>

<p>I've fixed up a fair number of older bikes and if you don't enjoy the process and satisfaction of making something old work again, it's almost never worth the effort. </p>

"How do I change a road bike into a commuter bike?","8192","","<p>I have a road bike that I commute to work on, just a 9km trip each way.  I also have some tightness in my lower back, especially since I usually sit in front of a computer screen.  My wife wants me to change my road bike set up so that I am no longer bent over when riding, but have a more upright posture.  Can I change the stem and handle bars easily (and cheaply) for a flat bar configuration so as to turn my road bike into a commuter bike?</p>

<p>P.S. I am also planning on getting some panniers fitted, so as to take the weight of a backpack off me, but that will probably be another question.</p>
","<p>You can probably change the stem to something shorter with more rise and not have anything else to change. This may be enough to relieve the back pressure and the drop bars will give you more hand positions which I've always found easier on my carpal tunnel.</p>

<p>Changing the handle bars to flat bars will mean you have to get a set of shifters and brake levers to go with the new handle bar style.</p>

<p>I'd also recommend that you get a set of full wrap fenders so you can keep the road spray to a minimum.</p>

<p>I'm a designer and programmer so I understand the issues around sitting all day. A better investment may be in your chair at the office and your desk. You're spending way more time sitting there every day than you are on your bike. That is the place that you can most likely get the most benefit by setting it up for a proper ergonomic workspace.</p>

"how do I paint a bicycle chain?","8192","","<p>I've seen chains with so many colours, white, red, you name it.</p>

<p>I would like to give it a try (this paint job is intended for visual styling of the bike, nothing related to protecting it), but I have no clue on how to do it.</p>

<p>I think there must be a way to paint it without ""glueing"" the links with paint, I don't know if spray paint does that or not... I'm sure I need to degrease it first, but then what follows?</p>

<p>So, the question:</p>

<p>How do I paint a chain without ruining it? (the painted chain needs to be in working conditions, it will be used).</p>
","<p>I think @freiheit already said it: paint the outside of the outer links!</p>

<p>If you ride single/fixed, this part of the links never touch anything else, so the paint does not wear out neither damage other working parts.</p>

<p>I would do it degreasing the chain very well (boiling with soap in the end, perhaps) and then using a hard foam paint roller, with the chain over the ground with its side facing up.</p>

<p>If you don't mind paying for the job, most the colored chains I've seen in google seem to be powder-coated (electrostatic) or anodized. This would give a probably good result, but I think you wouldn't want to pay the price :oP</p>

<p>Do they aid in shifting quality at all? I know that dura-ace and ultegra derailleurs use jockey wheels with bearings instead of bushings to improve durability, but they still use ceramics.</p>

"What are the benefits of drop bars?","8164","","<p>I come from a mountain biking background but I've also done a lot of cycle touring but I chose to go with flat bars and bar-ends vs drop bars. </p>

<p>I've also seen bikes that are designed for 'bike packing' such as the Salsa Fargo sporting drop bars.</p>

<p>Recently I've done more road biking but I still don't fully understand the reasons behind drop bars. Can you tell me what the benefits area?</p>
","<p>The main advantage is more hand positions. With a regular flat bar, you hold your hands at the grips (with possibly about one more hand position available if you have bar ends).</p>

<p>With drop bars, you can hold at:</p>

<ul>
<li>The brake hoods (on top of the brake levers)</li>
<li>The drops (the bottom part of the bar)</li>
<li>The tops (on the left and right of the stem)</li>
<li>That place between the hoods and the tops</li>
<li>Possibly others (or less of these, depending on who you ask).</li>
</ul>

<p>For long rides, this makes a difference due to hand fatigue. </p>

<p>A secondary advantage is you can also change how aerodynamic you are and your body geometry with respect to the bike by shifting around and using different hand positions relatively easily. For example, when you're in the drops, you're in a more aerodynamic shape versus sitting straight up with your hands on the tops. </p>

<hr>

<p>Drop bars aren't for everyone and do require proper setup (as do all bikes) and acknowledgement of the geometry of the bike. In particular, racers will likely set their bike up differently than tourers will (e.g. higher bars than racers), where its primarily a comfort thing. If you like doing long rides with flat bars and bar ends, more power to you. But for most people, the same bike won't work well with drop bars and flat bars because changing the bar changes the riding geometry. </p>

<p>My budget is $1500, but I would not mind to spend less in order not to worry
too much about theft and maybe even get a second bike. </p>

more towards racing or mtb, very few bikes even had rack mounts.</p>

<p>My concerns with the Randonee are:</p>

<p>-Main concern: Bar End Shifters. I've never had bar ends, but I have the feeling that they
are unsuitable for traffic. I have to go through a few streets with heavy
traffic I don't feel too comfortable in, even without taking my hands off the
brakes. I like integrated shifters.</p>

<p>-Minor concern: The Randonee is not overweight (29 lbs), but a bit too heavily built for my
purpose. I won't do any tours of more than a few days, most of my use will be running errands and doing tours (not races) with friends who have mostly cross or road bikes. I don't want to be the slowest.</p>

<p>Are these proper concerns? Did I overlook anything? Does one get used to the bar ends?</p>

<p>Other bikes I looked at:</p>

<p>-Novara Verita, $1200: Goes in the right direction, but sitting was uncomfortable
compared to Randonee, and they weren't able to identify the problem in the shop.</p>

sure this is low enough. </p>

<p>Bikes I read about but that I didn't see in any shop: Specialized Secteur,
Surly LHT, Trek, Surly Cross Check </p>

-take a rack and fenders
-have reliable brakes for all weather use in traffic
-preferably have integrated shifters
-low enough gear </p>
","<p>The Surly Pacer is a good choice. My first real bike was a one, and I used it for commuting, training rides, and a two-week tour in Europe. Even though it wasn't ""ideal"" for training rides or touring, it worked great for me until I was able to afford more specialized bikes. The Pacer doesn't come with as many rack bosses as you'll want (one advantage of the cross-check), but p-clamps did the trick for me.</p>

<p>That said, about your individual concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>bar-end shifters are great for touring bikes

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a fairly simple test to determine if the bottom bracket bearing is worn out. Shift the chain to the inner most rear sprockets front and rear. Drop the chain off the smallest front ring, and arrange it so it will not strike the chainrings. Spin the crank while holding the bike with one hand. If you feel an obvious rumbling or grinding feeling, the bearing are worn out and the unit should be replaced. Very worn bottom brackets will actually make a grinding noise.</p>

<p>I'd fix it now if you're getting these symptoms. Grinding is a sign of bicycle arthritis and is easily solved with new bearings. Bearings wear out and can lead to damage if not replaced.</p>

But I'm not sure I'm reading that chart correctly.</p>

<p>The bike currently has a Shimano Sora bottom pull front derailleur and a Shimano Tiagra rear derailleur.  Can I get by with just replacing the cassette?</p>
","<p>I posed a similar question (or at least a question which raises similar issues) on here a few months ago: <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/13294/upgrade-shimano-from-9-to-10-speed"">Moving tfrom Shimano 9- to Shimano 10- speed</a></p>

<p>The issue is not the different Shimano ranges per se, its going from 9 to 10 speed.</p>

<p>You can imagine that the 10-speed shifters will be expecting a 10-speed cassette at the other end of the wire - these things are indexed after all.</p>

<p>The other complication in going from a 9- to 10-speed cassette is the chain. You'd need a new, slimmer one. And unfortunately this means a new real derailleur too. Strictly speaking, this again knocks on to the front derailleur. And the chainrings. But as regards the front setup, I was advised that I should be able to get by with my existing setup.</p>

<p>Unless you specifically want to go to 10-speed, you may have some luck doing what I did - jump over 105 altogether and head for the old Ultegra 6500 range.....which was 9-speed. I suspect if you could find shifters from this range, it would do the trick. Alternatively you could go not quite as far and upgrade to Tiagra - I believe the current Tiagra range is now 10-speed, but its not so long ago that it was 9-speed. (The bike I raised my question about was a 2011 model.) Obviously Ultegra will give you better quality but you'll still find Tiagra shifters a noticeable step up from Soras. </p>

<p>If you really do want to go to a 10-speed 105 setup, well I think I costed it as something like GBP400 or more...not a lot less than buying the whole 105 groupset (which can be bought as a single product). But I seem to remember the biggest single cost was the shifters, so take that as an indication.</p>

<p>Any help and/or insight is appreciated.</p>
","<p>I don't think there will be a clear roof vs. trunk recommendation as both systems have their pros and cons:</p>

<h1>Roof</h1>

<h3>Pro</h3>

<ul>
<li>Does not cover the trunk lid (access to the trunk when fully loaded)</li>
<li>Bikes stay cleaner (Especially when raining - on the trunk, the rear of the car sucks up road grim which gets into the bikes moving parts)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Con</h3>

<ul>
<li>You have to lift the bikes up to the roof for mounting (more or less difficult depending on your size and roof height)</li>
<li>Significantly changes the car's steering and wind behaviour</li>
<li>Higher wind resistance, therefore higher fuel consumption</li>
<li>Risk of driving under a low object and significantly damaging bike and car (Putting a small sticker on the top of the windscreen in front of the driver - I use a red arrow - meaning ""Bikes on roof"") </li>
</ul>

<h1>Trunk</h1>

<h3>Pro</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lower wind resistance, therefore less influence on steering and fuel consumption (With modern cars such as the Mazda 3, this is surprisingly significant)</li>
<li>Loading/unloading is easier</li>
<li>Can see if bikes become insecure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Con</h3>

<ul>
<li>Maybe prevents access to the trunk when fully loaded (may depend on car and rack model)</li>
<li>Influences sight through rear mirror</li>
<li>Blocks rear lights and number plate (Legal considerations in most countries)</li>
<li>Bikes more prone to damage - Major : accident, dragging on ground, Cosmetic: rack design.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the scratches: the roof mounted one has the advantage of using points on the car that are dedicated to mounting, which means that there's very low danger of scratching your car (as long as you are careful when mounting the rack itself). The trunk mounted racks normally have some foam rubber on their fastening parts, which normally also prevent the car from scratches. So here, there's also normally no problem.</p>

<p>As long as you don't buy the next best cheap rack but have a look at some tests and invest a bit more money, both types will do their job. Also, as long as they have a reasonable mounting design (that is understood and used correctly), highway speeds (130km/h, 80mph) shouldn't be a problem with any of them. On the other hand, both types can be dangerous if the bikes are not properly fastened on the rack. As far as I know, the German technical control board (TÜV) and automobile clubs recommend the trunk version over the roof mounted one where possible, because of their lower influence on the steering of the car.</p>

"Suspension fork swap for rigid: axle-to-crown confusion","8046","","<p>I'm looking to replace the suspension fork on my bike with a rigid one. After much soul searching I've tentatively settled on the Surly 1x1. What's got me wrapped around the axle (pun intended!) is the axle-to-crown measurement.</p>

<p>The fork I have now is the <a href=""http://www.srsuntour-cycling.com/bike/forks/XCT-80-26-3962.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SR Suntour SF13-XCT</a>, which came stock on my Specialized mountain bike. This fork is listed as having <strong>80mm of travel and a 459mm total length</strong>. When measuring the distance between this fork's axle &amp; crown I've gotten very close to the 459mm listed on Suntour's site, which leads me to believe that the 459mm length listed by Suntour is correct.</p>

<p><a href=""http://surlybikes.com/parts/forks/1x1_fork"" rel=""nofollow"">The Surly 1x1 I'm looking at</a> has two versions: one ""corrected"" for suspension travel of 80mm (<strong>axle-to-crown length of 413mm</strong>), the other ""corrected"" for suspension travel of 100mm (<strong>axle-to-crown length of 453mm</strong>).</p>

<p>Both of the Surly A-to-C measurements are below the 459mm that I supposedly have to put in if my geometry &amp; handling are to stay the same.</p>

<p>In addition, the zip tie method allowed me to measure my <strong>sag as 18mm</strong>. (I normally keep my fork on its highest preload setting.)</p>

<p><strong>Now, for the question itself</strong>: Which of the two Surly 1x1's should I get? Should I, or should I not, take my sag into account, considering that Surly's forks appear to have been ""corrected"" for suspension travel already?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any guidance.</p>
","<p>Definitely you have to account for sag when measuring axle to crown distance, because that is the real geometry of the bike when it is actually being ridden. If you mention in this bike sag is 18 mm when you ride it, it should mean that your actual axle to crown distance is 459-18 = 441, thus suggesting you should use the fork corrected for 80mm travel.</p>

<p>Ideally you want to keep the geometry of the bike, particularly head tube angle and bottom bracket height (or pedal to ground clearance). Both are important. Head tube angle affects the steering response of the bike. Bottom bracket height defines how tall an object can be for you to roll over it without hitting it, and how much you can lean towards the side before the pedal hits the ground while pedaling (you should not put the ""inner"" pedal down while turning)</p>

<p>A bike with suspension fork actually changes it's geometry while riding due to the travel of the fork, and this is no trouble at all (for most riders), that means that a small variation in axle to crown distance would not terribly affect the bike handling characteristics.</p>

<p>In this case, if you chose the taller fork, you'd give your bike a slacker head tube angle, making it feel a bit less responsive on the steering, which in turn means (a little) more stability at high speed, and you would gain a few millimeters on pedal clearance. If you had the option for a third fork, shorter than the ones you already described, you'd get a bike with a steeper head tube angle, which gives a more responsive steering, the bike would feel very agile, but less stable, and you would loose a little pedal clearance.</p>

","<p>The crank you point to would probably fit on your bottom bracket, but might result in a bad chainline.</p>

<p>There are two things to consider when replacing your cranks: the interface between the cranks and the bottom bracket, and the distance from the centerline.</p>

<p>Your old Suntour cranks and the Shimano you link to both use a JIS square taper. So the interface is fine. </p>

<p>However, your old cranks are designed to be installed on a 122-mm bottom-bracket spindle (and I'll assume that's what you've got), while the Shimano you link to is designed for a 113-mm spindle.

<p>Ultegra is basically the same as Shimano's absolute top of the line (Dura Ace), except a bit heavier.</p>

<p>This should stop your gear slippage. If the shifter cable isn't properly lubricated or there's binding somewhere then you should see a problem while dialing in the adjustment. If you can't get this adjustment right to your satisfaction take the bike back and have the shop do it. They shouldn't charge you for this if the bike is new. Make sure they test ride it so they can experience the problem.</p>

<p>If this is an old hub and you've ridden it misadjusted for a long time it is possible to damage the hubs innards. Replacing the hub guts should only be done at a shop that deals with these hubs regularly and has the special lubricating bath that they require for proper maintenance. </p>

"Disc brakes make noise","7953","","<p>My disc-brakes on my mountain bike sing/scream when I brake. I have tried to clean them, but it didn't work. Should I replace the disks or the brake pads? Is there a better (cheaper) way to fix this.</p>
","<p>In short, squeaking brakes are caused by the sound of your pads sticking then slipping increadibly quickly, rather than applying presssure to your discs smoothly.</p>

<p>Solution:  Sometimes these problems can be a right pain in the butt.  Sometimes your brakes need time to bed in, sometimes, as you know, your discs just need cleaning, or importantly, drying. But if that doesn't work you need to rough up your discs.  You can get products with abrasives in them just for this purpose, or, less expensively.. I know many people have had success with very fine sand paper.   </p>

<p>Give that a try before replacing your discs.</p>

"How do you install a hub dynamo?","7933","","<p>I want to buy a Shimano hub dynamo, but I'm encountering problems getting a bike shop to commit to installing it for me if I buy it. So I have a couple questions that I'm hoping some of you guys might be able to help me out with.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can a wheel be rebuilt replacing the old regular hub with the dynamo?  Or does this require a new wheel to be built?  (I've heard once that it's difficult to rebuild a wheel with a rim that has already been built before).</p></li>
<li><p>If you can rebuild a wheel, and the hub is a bit larger in diameter than the old hub, do the spokes need to be replaced/shortened, or can they be still be used?  Is there some guideline or rule of thumb about the length of a spoke as long as they're all consistent?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the installation of a hub dynamo the same as a standard hub?  I know that the hub has a lot of moving parts inside, but it seems no different on the outside, and I wonder if there are special steps or considerations when installing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate any info anyone can give me!  I feel like these bicycle shops have simply never had any experience with a hub dynamo and their first reaction is just ""no"".</p>

<p>Edit: As a side question, does anyone have any experience with wheel building?  Is this a straightforward process?  This is something I wouldn't mind learning how to do.  Is this the kind of task where you can destroy a wheel or two in the learning process, or will I just need spend more time adjusting to get it right as I learn? </p>
","<p>Briefly:</p>

<p>1) yes, you can re-use the existing rim.</p>

<p>2) yes, you could shorten the existing spokes, but that would be expensive and foolish.</p>

<p>3) The installation is the same except now you have wires so you need to plug them into the hub too.</p>

<p>The main issue is (2). Spokes are usually only reused when the rim is being replaced with an identical rim (usually a new one for a worn one), and even then most wheelbuilders will prefer new spokes. Spokes bend a little as they're built into the wheel, and getting those bends in exactly the right place when you rebuild the wheel is effectively impossible. So you'll build the wheel, ride it a little, the spokes will bend back and you'll have to re-tension everything. Usually more than once. If you're paying someone to do this it's cheaper to just buy new spokes.</p>

<p>It's possible to shorten spokes, there are <a href=""http://www.philwood.com/products/tools/spokemach.php"" rel=""nofollow"">spoke cutting</a> tools for this. They're normally used to make really short spokes (for putting a dyno hub into a 16"" wheel, for example) but these days it's possible to buy spokes online in almost any size. But you could sit there and shorten all the spokes in your wheel. But again, if you're paying someone else to do this for you it will be more expensive than a new set of spokes. The tool is also much more expensive than a set of spokes.</p>

<p>If your rim is in good condition that's the bit to keep. If it is worthwhile, you may be better off selling the whole wheel and buying a new rim anyway.</p>

"Are 22mm tires too thin for commuting?","7883","","<p>I recently switched from a mountain bike to a road bike with 22mm tires for commuting. </p>

<p>I noticed right away that I could not do the things like hop over curbs with this new bike. I also got flats. Lots of flats. I would get 1 flat per week, and I got good at patching tires. After a few weeks of this i got <a href=""http://mrtuffy.com/"">Tuffy</a> tire liners and haven't gotten a flat since. I patched up all holes in my tires from inside before putting them in (and they were a pain to put in).</p>

<p>I still have the following fears:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I am going fast and I hit a small (less then 3"" bump), I might get a pinch flat.</li>
<li>I cannot ride off a curb onto the payment without wrecking my bike.</li>
<li>I cannot hop curbs.</li>
<li>I must check my tires after every ride for glass lodged in them and take it out with tweezers.</li>
<li>If there is a sizeable hole (from glass) in my tire, I must use a patch kit to patch it up.</li>
<li>I must always ride at 120psi per tire (I weigh ~200lbs).</li>
<li>My stopping power compared to the mountain bike is really really bad (especially in the rain).</li>
<li>I must pay <em>extreme</em> attention to the road and go around bumps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should I be worried about these concerns? Are 22mm tires too thin for commuting?</p>

<p><strong>Followup</strong>:</p>

<p>Well, after about 2 months of daily commuting on the road bike I have this to say in the defense of my earlier self:</p>

<p>My biggest issues turned out to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>My bike lock which I used to attach to my bike created <strong>a lot</strong> of vibration which in turn made it impossible for me to hear any noise my bike was making. One time I rode on a flat for a few minutes because I couldn't hear/tell it was there because of the vibration/noise. This incident made me think that flats on a road bike were undetectable.</li>
<li>I rode clipless which scared me in traffic. </li>
</ol>

<p>I've since started to carry my bike lock in my backpack so now I can hear my bike. I've also replaced my awesome clipless pedals with regular ones which made me feel much more comfortable in high traffic. Not fearing death actually made me faster with regular pedals in the city.</p>

<p>Commuting on the road bike is a blast. I love passing everyone, and now that I figured out how to properly use both brakes, I can actually stop almost as quickly as I could on my fat tired mountain bike.</p>
","<p>Most of your fears are unfounded or way overblown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I am going fast and I hit a small (less then 3"" bump) I might get a pinch flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pinch flats do not occur on tires that are properly inflated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot not ride off a curb on to the payment and not wreck my bike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do this on both my commuter and my racing bike. Just do it gently and not violently.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot hop curbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do this at slow speeds with no problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I must check my tires after every ride for glass lodged in them and take it out with tweezers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easier is to just not ride through glass. I've never had to pick glass out of my tires after three years of commuting by bike.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there is a sizable hole (from glass) in my tire I must use a patch kit to patch it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. But again, you shouldn't be flatting this often. I made it 6,500mi on my last pair of tires.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I must always ride at 120psi per tire (I weigh ~200lbs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ride at whatever the printed range is on the tire itself. Some road tires are fine at 85psi. Usually this involves topping up air once every week (for 120+psi tires) or two to three weeks (for 85psi tires).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My stopping power compared to the mountain bike is really really bad (especially in the rain).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your front brake should be more than capable of hurtling you over the handlebars if slammed shut at speed. Braking power will be significantly impacted in the rain, however.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I must pay extreme attention to the road and go around bumps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Way overblown. Don't go plowing into 5-inch potholes, sure.</p>

<p>If you're having this many problems, you're probably treating your road bike like a mountain bike (why are you having to hop curbs so often — it's a <em>road</em> bike, not a sidewalk bike) and you probably have worn out and/or bargain bin tires. Get some decent tires with puncture protection and chill out a bit.</p>

"What is the impact of changing to a smaller chainring?","7878","","<p>My road bike has a Campagnolo Veloce gearset. It's running 53 and 39 tooth chainrings. I have a 13-25 10sp cassette.</p>

<p>I find that a lot of the time when I'm cruising, I'm on the big chainring and in the 3rd or 4th largest gears on the back. There is a fairly significant chain angle. Because of this, the chain is a bit noisy and I'm sure it's stressing the drivetrain a little. Also, when I need to drop down a gear I quickly need to drop onto the small chainring which necessitates significant adjustments on the rear.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of changing the 53 chainring to a 50t. I am happy to lose a little top end speed.</p>

<p>According to my theory, dropping a 53t to a 50t will reduce my gear ratio by 1.06 (53/50). Which would be the equivalent of switching from a 17t on the back to an 18t. Assuming this is correct, it's not going to have a very big impact, but it might be enough to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p>I know there is an option of using a 3 chainring crankset, but I think that will be a bit too expensive and still won't solve the core issue of getting the right sized large chainring.</p>

<p>The other option is to change the cassette but I can't see many that would really make much of a difference. If I could get a 15-25 that'd probably be about right.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will the change mean I need to change or adjust the front derailler, the rear derailler or  the chain?</li>
<li>Will there be any other impacts I haven't thought of?</li>
<li>Any other ideas to solve the problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: As indicated <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6172/bbb-chainring-will-not-fit"">here</a> the BBB chainring doesn't fit. Looks like a proper compact crankset is my only option now.</p>
","<p>I would consider changing your crankset to a true compact, 50t/34t, and running an 11/25 rear cassette. </p>

<p>Campy actually made a specific derailleur for running a compact front, because they said that the 50t doesn't work well with the standard front derailleur (that may be a function of the tooth differential, so it may not apply if you leave the 39t in place). </p>

<p>(Edit: It does appear that my data on the campy front derailleur may be outdated. Their 10 speed Chorus and Record had an individualized front derailleur, but current product appears more universal.)</p>

<p>The 50t x 11t combo is a 119.6in gear, compared to 107.2inches for the 53t x 13t you're running now. </p>

<p>It will give you a slightly faster gear than current, a better climbing range, and slightly crisper shifting. Downside is you have to buy the crank set and cassette, not just a chain ring.</p>

<p>I have been considering choosing a new bike with disc brakes, but I have seen mixed reviews on whether or not they are really better or are just something that looks cool?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Whether disc brakes are better or not, depends on what application you plan on using them for. Road bike? Mountain bike?</p>

<p>For mountain bike use and possibly even a commuter bike, yes, disc brakes will be much better. They can provide more power, better control and they can <em>usually</em> be easily modulated. They will almost always be better in rain and wet weather, which I think it one of the main advantages of using disc brakes.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, if this is your first time switching to a disc brake setup, then you will have something new to learn in terms of maintenance and brake adjustments. Of course, anything can be learned... Disc brakes will also weigh a bit more than traditional rim brakes.</p>

<p>Personally, I will always go with a bike with discs. Reason being, is that I know they will always work, no matter the conditions. They are reliable and provide the confidence that I need when I am riding a bike, whether on the road or on the trail.</p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages to chain wax?","7822","","<p>I recently bought a new chain for my bike and it came full of chain wax. I was wondering if this was a better lubricant then regular chain lube, or if it had some other qualities that the manufactures thought would be better than lube?</p>
","<p>I suspect that it's cheaper for the manufacturer. Or if they're advertising it, it may just be a market differentiator. Regardless, leave it there rather than trying to remove it because it's right inside the chain where you need it. By all means wipe off any excess on the outside, but don't use a chain cleaner.</p>

<p>The different types of chain lube have been discussed at length on the web and elsewhere, and to the best of my knowlege the definitive answer is ""it depends"".</p>

<p>Broadly: oil-based (wet) lubes are more water resistant but attract gunk and turn into black sticky goo on your chain, grease-based (wet) lubes are more water and mud resistant but attract even more gunk, and wax (dry) lubes attract little gunk but wash off more easily. You also get various additives (usually teflon) to reduce friction. Then there are solvents used to remove gunk, like WD40 and kerosene. Despite sometimes being called oils, they are not useful as lubricants except in the immediate ""stuck bolt"" sense - they evaporate very quickly.</p>

<p>The consensus seems to be use wet lubes in the wet, dry lubes in the dry, and caution when discussing the subject.</p>

"my chain is skipping on my single speed","7801","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F0ThD.jpg"" alt=""sprocket""></p>

<p>The chain keeps wanting to load towards the right hand side of the cog no matter how I orientate the chain. This causes painful skipping. Do the marks have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>I have a singulator and I've moved this left-right and even removed it but i still get the same issue: chain loading towards one side and skipping.</p>

<p>ideas?</p>
","<p>Your chain skipping/dropping could be the result of a few things, so I'll lay them out briefly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your chain/freewheel could be worn out. If you recently replaced your chain, the worn out teeth of the freewheel won't mesh with the new chain and will cause skipping. Simply examining the profile of the freewheel teeth with pictures of a new one will give you a sense of whether this is a possibility. (Worn out teeth are sharper at the tops and, in serious wear, form little waves or shark-fins.) </p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that the chain installed is too narrow for the freewheel teeth (though it would be a <strong>very</strong> noticeable problem.) Muti-speed chains are typically 3/32"" wide, while some single speed chains are 1/8"" wide. Freewheels are manufactured in both widths. Where one can run a 1/8"" chain on either width freewheel, a 3/32"" chain will bind noticeably on a 1/8"" freewheel.</p></li>
<li><p>The singulator installed on your bike may not be providing enough chain tension. The actual alignment of this component won't cause the chain to skip as it it on the slack side of the chain. This is an unlikely scenario but could occur if it has been in service for a while or damaged in some way. Replacing the spring will bring it back to original tension specs.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>most likely</strong> thing I can imagine is that your chain-line is off. Your chainring is set further out from the center-line of the bicycle than the freewheel is, causing it to catch on the freewheel teeth and be thrown off. If the bicycle is a homebrewed single-speed, chances are you reused the original crank and bottom bracket spindle that were designed for a multi-speed bike. If this is a store-bought bike, it wasn't set up properly. <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/chainline.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is Sheldon Brown's article explaining the chain-line and how it is adjusted. In a nutshell, you will use different BB spindle lengths, BB spacers, and/or chainring spacers to line up the chainring with the freewheel. This can be done easily if you have the right tools and some patience. <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6811/how-to-sight-a-chain-line?rq=1"">Here</a> is a SE question relating to adjusting chainlines.

<p>While I see that some clipless pedal shoes are ""walkable"" I don't see much if any data regarding wearing it as a normal shoe all the time.  Preferably I would like to get about the same amount of wear as a regular shoe out of it.   Just for normal everyday walking around the office, out to lunch, and that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Is there some specific model recommendations or something specific in terms of feature I can look for, or is using the same shoe for both things out of the question?  I think it will be required - and I'm definitely open to - using MTB shoes on a road bike (as I think the increased pedaling efficiency will outweigh the weight drawbacks considering my usage pattern), but if it can't be done I would prefer to not get clipless and just buy some inexpensive shoes and continue to use pedal clips.</p>
","<p>Given a choice of clips or ""walkable"" clipless, I would strongly recommend ""walkable"" clipless unless you are also attempting to run/walk large distances. </p>

<p>I have 2 sets of MTB shoes. One is comfortable for all day walking - not as good as running shoes, as the sole is stiffer. The other is a better show on the bike - but too stiff for a lot of off bike work - great for the odd 100 meter portage..... Depending on the ride and whats happening at each end of it, depends on the shoes. </p>

<p>What is clear to me is the compromise - whats best on the bike is a very stiff sole. Off the bike is something more flexible. You need to decide where the priority sits, but I would go for a flexible shoe if all you are doing is commuting - especially if you commute less than an hour a day. </p>

<p>As far as pedal systems - SPD style cleats are the way to go - theres a huge range of MTB shoes that take these - everything from dedicated cycle though to comfortable street shoes.... </p>

"Buying first hybrid bike; better to put $ into components or disc brakes?","7724","","<p>I'm looking to replace my 2008 comfort cruiser with a fitness style hybrid. My budget allows for maxing out at $500 (on the new fitness hybrid bike itself). I ride rails-to-trails with the kids, charity rides, and would like to commute to work on occasion (15 miles round trip). </p>

<p>Ultimately the decision comes down to bike feel, but with the limited budget, am I better to put my money into upgraded components or disc brakes?</p>
","<p>Typically, you don't <em>need</em> disc brakes on a bike which lives on the road or other nice surfaces. The primary advantage on the road is that you don't have to deal with wheel true-ness as much, and that they look cool. For wet weather riding, they can stop you a bit quicker, but with properly adjusted V-brakes, you can stop pretty damn quickly once you learn to feather the brakes. Discs also cost significantly more than rim brakes, and lower quality disc brakes (which you'll get in the ~500 dollar price range) will perform about as well as decent rim brakes. Your rims will last longer with a disc brake, but this is rarely to never an issue with a hybrid rider who doesn't put <em>very</em> high mileage.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of disc brakes are many -- for example, the front fork will be heavier since it needs to be more robust to handle the <a href=""http://julesandjames.myzen.co.uk/disk_and_quick_release/"">forces of disc brakes</a>, and they weigh more than most rim brakes (weight weenie-ing isn't a big deal on a 500 dollar bike). Also, you'll have to take a lot of money (probably 20% of the budget) for the disc brakes, versus well less than half of that for rim brakes. </p>

<p>I think <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/disc-brakes.html"">this article</a> from John Allen makes a good summary with a nice point-by-point list of advantages and disadvantages. Generally, for most people, the rim brakes in this price range are the better choice and enjoy the better components all around (these days, you'll probably get 1 level up in the drive train and a carbon fork, which is nice). And your dollar will go a lot farther on a used bike than a new bike (another post recently described a used Trek 7.5 FX for ~450 dollars, which would be a fantastic non-disc option for a hybrid). </p>

<p>If you do want to get discs in the future, you do need a disc compatible frame and fork (excluding solutions like BrakeTherapy), as well as hubs on the wheels, so if you think you'll want them in the future, you probably should just buy the disc brake version (or buy the non-disc version, sell it and then buy a disc bike). </p>

<p>Side note: Hybrids generally have two distinguishing options between models from a given manufacturer: with/without suspension and with/without disc brakes. Generally, you should choose no suspension (unless your doctor tells you otherwise (i.e. you have severe back problems)) and fit decently large tires, and without disc brakes since for most riders they wont see an advantage unless the disc brakes are high quality and their riding conditions require it. Usually, cheaper hybrids run mountain bike groups on a flat bar setup, while more expensive ones run road bike groups on a flat bar setup. You also get carbon forks after you spend a bit of money, which is nice.</p>

"Bamboo bikes - the verdict?","7697","","<p>I'm curiously interested in buying a bamboo bike for use as a Sunday road bike, and I'm just wondering whether they're suitable: </p>

<ul>
<li>Strength at high speed?  I live near <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parbold"">Parbold</a>, which has nice hill for climbing and of course speeding down.  So my question is whether the bike would hold together at 40mph+?</li>
<li>Durability in the wet?  The UK has some miserable weather. I accept that the bike would be like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suede"">suede</a> jacket, and not something to be caught in the rain with!</li>
<li>Weight - found a quote of a 60cm road frame weighs just under 2.5 kilos.  I think that's substantially more than carbon or my titanium road bike frame.</li>
<li>Joints - Would you go for a bike frame with <a href=""http://www.bambikes.com/"">steel interlocking joints</a> or <a href=""http://bambike.com/"">bamboo throughout</a>?</li>

<li><a href=""http://bambike.com/"">Bamb EcoLogical Technology</a> (my preferred choice) </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bambikes.com/"">BamBikes.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a note, this is for fun, I just want to be safe.  I fully acknowledge that I won't be winning races on this bike, but not being dropped from the peloton would be good!</p>
","<p><strong><em>Strength at high speed?</em></strong> I have ridden my road frame for 2 years now, and have many miles on it. One of my favorite rides takes me to a hilly section where I have a long sweeping downhill. On a good day, I can reach 70 km/hour. At the bottom is a bit of a tight bend where lateral forces are a plenty. The joints and the bamboo are holding up better than I expected. I love it!</p>

<p><strong><em>Durability in the wet?</em></strong> The natural characteristics of the bamboo are phenomenal, including the water resistance of the exterior skin. As long as you seal it well so moisture cannot get inside (particularly where the skin is not present, like cuts and nicks in the bamboo or where the shoots come out of the sides at the nodes) you have nothing to worry about. I have been caught in some pretty horrendous monsoon downpours here in Thailand.</p>

<p><strong><em>Weight</em></strong> - My 54cm road frame weighed in at 2.0 kgs. I built it light as I am a 150 lb rider. The last road frame (we call Thai Silk) that went out the door was a 58cm which weighed in at 5.4 kgs. </p>

<p><strong><em>Joints</em></strong> - The only place you really need steel is where the bearings or threads go, like head tube, bottom bracket, drop outs (even then, there are ways around this as well). The joints are plenty strong from carbon fiber or fiberglass. Thermal expansion factors are something we consider on our proprietary joint construction. Some builders have abandoned carbon fiber because it is too stable, others have abandoned hemp/sisal joints because the rigidity degrades too rapidly. If you choose to use steel joint lugs, you will need to overcome the challenge of a good bond between the bamboo and the steel.

"What are the benefits of nickel-plated chains?","7697","","<p>Bicycle chains with higher model numbers (and slightly higher prices) are often nickel-plated or half-nickel-plated. What are the benefits of nickel-plated chains over non-nickel-plated chains?</p>

<p>How durable is the plating--does it wear off, or do its benefits last for the life of the chain?</p>
","<p>Nickel plated chains have this done for aesthetic purposes, and to provide corrosion resistance. They are also less susceptible to the chain binding itself up. </p>

<p>When two metallic surfaces create friction against each other, they create small areas of abrasion (Much like a plaque in your arteries). Over time, these increase to the point where the chain can kink in spots. Nickel helps to stave this off.</p>

<p>The wearing may be slightly higher than with a non coated chain, but the difference to the lifespan of the cogs (cassette) is negligible. Chains should be replaced around the 2500km mark on a regular basis, and cassettes anywhere from 5000-10000km depending on many factors. You'll go through 2-3 chains per cassette, and usually I replace my cassette with every 3rd chain no matter what.</p>

<p>Dust/dirt/mud and poor maintenance will do more harm and accelerate wear faster than any plating on the chain will.</p>

"Are aerodynamic rims worth additional weight?","7695","","<p>I was under the impression that reducing the weight of your wheels is important. However, I'm noticing that many of the extremely high-end aerodynamic rims are actually heavier than cheaper rims by the same manufacturer.</p>

<p>Obviously the prices seem to support the idea that aerodynamics matter more than a few hundred grams of weight, but at what point does the added weight offset the gain? Or is the importance of reducing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_performance#Advantages_of_light_wheels"" rel=""nofollow"">rotational weight overstated</a>?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Obviously the prices seem to support the idea that aerodynamics matter
  more than a few hundred grams of weight, but at what point does the
  added weight offset the gain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An exact calculation will depend on the total mass of you and your bike, your speed, the wind, its angle, whether you're climbing, on the flat, or descending, and the speed you're going (or the power you're putting out). However, we can make ballpark estimates of many of those variables to get an approximate answer. </p>

<p>Let's say the aero wheels add 100 grams of total mass compared to the ""stock"" wheels, and in return reduce your drag area, CdA, by .005 m^2. That's a ballpark improvement for a reasonably aero wheel compared to a standard box rim, though for extremely well-designed wheels you can see perhaps double that difference (~ .01 m^2) or more, especially at high yaw angles. </p>

<p>The power equation for a bicycle is well-understood and was given in this <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9938/how-can-one-estimate-drag-for-a-bicycle"">Bicycles Stackexchange answer</a>. Thus to determine the point at which it is preferable to trade off lower weight for aerodynamic drag, we can substitute suitable values for mass, speed, slope, and so on, and plot the power savings, as is done here. </p>

<p>The figure below compares an 80 kg rider plus bike with standard box rims vs
an 80.1 kg rider plus bike with aero rims. We presume the aero rims save .005 m^2 in drag area compared to the standard rims. Three dotted lines show the power savings for a climb of 5%, a flat road, and a 5% descent. The x-axis shows the speed of the rider in km/h, while the y-axis shows the savings for the lighter wheels -- when the dotted line is above the solid horizontal zero line, it is better to have lighter wheels; when the dotted line falls below the solid horizontal zero line, it is better to have the more aerodynamic wheels. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7drAx.png"" alt=""weight vs. aero drag comparison""></p>

<p>As you can see, only for steep climbs at low speed is it preferable to have lighter wheels; however, for this particular comparison of weight savings and aero drag savings, the benefit is small, less than a watt. As speed increases, the dotted line eventually dips below zero and it becomes better to opt for the aero savings. </p>

<p>That was for a steep hill. On the flat and for descents, you will almost always be better off with the more aero wheels. </p>

<p>Note that the savings in power is still relatively modest. When racing, even small benefits can accrue to determine victory or loss, but for normal recreational riding you may want to keep the magnitude of lighter wheels vs more aero wheels in mind, especially if your budget is limited. Only you can decide whether the relative benefit is cost effective.</p>

<li>Although your bicycle is most definitely steel, your seatpost is not -- it's aluminum-alloy, which does not 'rust', but definitely corrodes (creating aluminum oxide).</li>
<li>WD-40 is a penetrating oil which is designed to, amongst other things, break up iron-oxides. However, it is pretty much useless against aluminum-oxides, especially when they have already corroded &amp; bonded.</li>

<p>Research into brain injuries has been ongoing, but tended to focus more on direct impacts. In the last 70 years there has been more research into rotational brain injuries, and in the 1990s and 2000s scientific, evidence based proposals were made to reduce these. The Multi-Directional Impact ­Protection System is an implementation of these, and it's effectiveness has been validated by independent research. </p>

<p>There is lots of research into brain injury. While much of it has focused on direct impact leading to scull fracture, the effects of sudden head rotation have been studied since the <a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pdf/esv/esv22/22ESV-000263.pdf"">1940s</a>.

BB height affects stability of your ride, but mostly while standing on the pedals since you weight is then directly on the BB. but raising it 7mm may or may not make a difference in your ride. however, raising it ABOVE the axle height will make a dramatic difference in stability. BMX bikes are incredibly nimble (aka unstable) due to them having a BB higher than their axles, where as 29'ers will feel solid as a rock since they have a dropped BB height relative to their axles. it has to do with torque applied while standing. (i know wheel size also plays a factor but we're assuming spherical cow here). so considering that the DROP or RISE from the axle height affects the ride more than height, a 13in BB height on a BMX will feel much different than a 13 in BB height on a 29'er.  </p>

<p>my track bike has a BB height equal to its axles, and its nimble and fun to ride, where as my road bike has a BB drop height relative to the axles and feels like a cruiser in comparison (both on 700c rims). </p>

<p>TL;DR higher BB, in relation to axle height, means a more nimble bike, lower BB is a more stable bike. especially while standing. </p>

"Can a bike with an internal bottom bracket be retrofitted to have an external bottom bracket?","7607","","<p>External bottom brackets have been appearing on higher-end bikes in the last few years.  Can older bikes with bottom bracket shells that come stock with square taper internal ISO 68mm or oversized ISO 73mm bottom brackets be retrofitted with external cups when it comes time to replace the bottom bracket?  I am well aware that the cranks will have have to be replaced, too.</p>
","<p>The external bottom bracket uses the same thread size and shell width as an older internal BB. They were specifically designed to allow use in a standardized frame without redesign. </p>

<p>They do require a new crank set, and depending on the model, and what is on your current bike, that may mean the purchase of extra components in order to be compatible with the correct number of gears/width of chain. If you are going from 9 speed MTB to 9 speed MTB components, for example, a like for like change, then it should be just the crank set and BB that change.</p>

<p>An external BB is also designed to fit on either a 68mm or 73mm shell. They are universal, as long as you dont have a pressfit BB, or an Italian thread BB. Similar crank sets are available for non-english thread BB's, but it must be designed for your frame's BB shell type specifically.</p>

"How to replace a Sturmey Archer's cable?","7597","","<p>I would like to replace the cable of a Sturmey Archer hub, but can't find a way to disassemble the old cable without destroying it, and it puzzles me how to insert the new cable.</p>

<p>To better explain, I have five elements:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cable</li>
<li>The cable tip 1 (top)</li>
<li>The cable tip 2 (bottom)</li>
<li>The adjusting part (for the lack of the proper term, I'm refering to the cylindric piece that screws into the hub's cable)</li>
<li>The housing of the cable</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven't found a way to remove the cable (1) because tip 1 and 2 (2, 3) are attached to the cable, and the adjusting part (4) also is attached and doesn't pass through tip 2 (3). The housing is also too small for the rest to pass through.</p>

<p>I wouldn't mind keeping the current cable, but would really like to know how to replace it.</p>

<p>Here's a photo to document this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGVVS.jpg"" alt=""Sturmey Archer cable removal""></p>

<p>Another one showing the ""adjusting part"":</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1BcU.gif"" alt=""Adjusting part""></p>
","<p>You are correct. This is different than ""regular"" cables. On regular cables you pick the end you want and cut off the other. Thats because the connection on the cut-off end is usually a clamp. You run the cable under a screw/nut and tighten it down. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/flqu5.jpg"" alt=""cable clamp""></p>

<p>Then you just put a cable crimp on the end to protect the cut cable
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jr9nm.jpg"" alt=""cable crimp""></p>

<p>However, your internal hub cable is differnet. The cable and housing is really one piece. You have to replace it all together. I have a similar issue on my Shimano internal 3 speed hub. Luckily you can get an entire replacement set (cable and housing).You can get something like this from Harris Cyclery (I only hype them because a Sheldon Brown article was helpful to this post.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uX4jt.jpg"" alt=""sturmer archer cable""></p>

<p>You'll have to make sure that the barrel is the same threading as your ""adjusting part"" and that you get the length you need. A sales person (or phone call) should get you the exact part. It would probably help to know the model of your hub. It should be engraved or stamped somewhere visible.</p>

"Can a chain-lock be better against cutting than a U-lock?","7591","","<p>I'm looking for a bike lock and, in 2013, Kryptonite have a new lock, the <a href=""http://www.kryptonitelock.com/Pages/ProductInformation.aspx?PNumber=000792"" rel=""noreferrer"">Evolution Series 4 Mini Chain</a>:</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>On that note:</p>

<p>To actually manage to remove the lock, <strong>would you have to cut through a single link completely in two places?</strong> See the red marked below: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCN62.jpg"" alt=""Cutting the Kryptonite Evolution Mini Chain""></p>

<p>If yes, then that would require cutting through 20 mm of manganese steel — <strong>exceeding the 18 mm thickness of the Kryptonite <a href=""http://www.kryptonitelock.com/Pages/ProductInformation.aspx?PNumber=997986"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fahgettaboudit</a></strong> that is often regarded as one of the best D-locks.</p>

<p>So when considering cutting, <strong>is the Evolution Mini Chain is actually more secure?</strong> (With the added benefit of being more flexible than a D-lock.)</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>On the other hand, if cut only once, <strong>would the chain link bend enough to allow the other to slip through?</strong></p>
","<p>As for the Kryptonite, cutting one side an bending is certainly possible, but in reality if you can cut one side, you use the same tools to cut the other. The tools needed to bend the link after cutting one side are almost certainly not portable, and why would you carry two tools when one will do.</p>

<p>In comparison to the D-lock - if you can cut though 18mm, you can cut through 20. It will make no difference. The main difference is a D-lock is susceptible to different tools to a chain. For real security - use both. </p>

<p>The reality is if they want it, is theirs, and the sweet nothing you can do about it. 
The job of your lock is to make you bike less desirable than the one next to it. If you bike is a $10K dream machine, that's going to be a tough job- you will need so much heavy metal it will weight more than the cheapest supermarket hack, and take so long to secure the time saving you get riding it is lost at each end of the journey. If its a $100 hack, then any half decent lock will be good enough.  </p>

"How do I align my front brake disk with the caliper?","7565","","<p>I have manual Avid disc brakes.</p>

<p>I took my front wheel off like I've done hundreds of times. When I put it back on the wheel is aligned properly with my fork, but the disc presses against one of the brake pads. This causes a lot of squeaking when I simply roll the bike and a ton of friction that will eventually destroy the brake altogether. This really isn't making sense to me other than the possibility that the caliper just isn't aligned properly, which seems practically impossible because all you do is screw it in. </p>

<p>I have tried adjusting the sensitivity of the brakes to the point where the problem pad is off of the disc. Then the other pad is so far out that I have 0 braking power when I try to apply it (other than a little friction from the problem pad). Can anyone please help me?</p>
","<p>It's not that unusual for a front brake to move a bit when taking it off and reattaching it. This is due to the small amount of space between the fork ends, axle, and QR bolts. The fork flexes a bit when you put the wheel back on. That small space that it moves is a lot relative to the clearance that disc brake pads have. That's likely why your brake pads aren't lining up again. </p>

<p>Now, the fix (NB: the following assumes that by ""manual Avid disc brakes,"" what you mean is ""mechanical disc brakes.""):</p>

<p>It sounds like you're overlooking a couple of points of adjustment. There is a red knob/wheel that adjusts either side of most Avid mechanical disc brakes, one on the inside and one on the outside. There are also caliper positioning bolts (CPS, the ""S"" is for system) that move the entire caliper perpendicular to and directly above, the bolts that attach the caliper to the frame.</p>

<p>The basic procedure to properly align your brakes is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loosen the bolts perpendicular to the mounting point so that the whole caliper moves easily.</li>
<li>Completely loosen both of the red pad adjustment discs.</li>
<li>Tighten the inboard pad adjustment knob until the rotor is centered in the caliper.</li>
<li>Tighten the outboard pad adjustment knob until the brake is clamped onto the rotor. This ensures that the caliper is centered on the rotor.</li>
<li>Tighten the CPS bolts.</li>
<li>Loosen the pad adjustment discs evenly, one click on one pad, one click on the other until they no longer rub. It may not be perfectly even, one pad may require a bit more loosening than the other. Don't worry about that as long as they don't rub. </li>

"Sources of vibration at high speed in and around rear wheel","7560","","<p>I’m experiencing vibration somewhere in the rear half of the bicycle when descending at high speed (say more than 30 mph), and I haven’t been able to pinpoint the cause. Everything looks fine, everything I’ve tried wiggling seems solid, and nothing seems to be getting hot except the brakes and rim.</p>

<p>I’d like help figuring what, if anything is wrong.</p>

<p>I could try to describe my observations in more detail, though I hesitate to do so for two reasons. First, they are all fuzzy and potentially misleading, since it’s hard to examine the bicycle while it’s moving 30-40 mph, and it makes me nervous so I slow down and the vibration stops. Second, it seemed like it could be useful to have a checklist of things to look into when experiencing such vibration, that isn’t limited to my particular problem. (If it’s more appropriate for this community, I’ll edit this question to add my observations.)</p>
","<p>Note: I've included things not at the rear of the bike as sometimes we think something is coming from one area when it's actually caused by another.</p>

<p>List of things I would check:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wheels true and round without rubber (check dishing too, but unlikely to cause vibration)</li>
<li>Adding rubber (tire and tube) and inflating does not take wheel assembly out of true (some tires seem to float from side to side a bit and this can make things wobble a bit at speed.</li>
<li>Wheel attachments such as reflectors don't lead to excessive imbalance.</li>
<li>Accessories such as pump, water bottle, lock are firmly attached.</li>
<li>Check entire wheel assembly: spokes, skewers, bearings. Everything should be free of cracks, dents, bends. Parts that move should do so smoothly (bearings, freewheel). Things that should be straight should be straight (spokes, skewers).</li>
<li>Pawls inside freewheel engage and slip smoothly and correctly.</li>
<li>Frame is intact, no cracks or bends. Especially the chainstay and seat stay.</li>
<li>Fork is intact, no cracks or bends.</li>
<li>Headset is installed correctly, no play in steering.</li>
<li>Seat post is intact, no cracks or bends.</li>
<li>Seat post is tight to frame.</li>
<li>Saddle is tight to seat post.</li>
<li>Finally I would check the bottom bracket area. This gets a lot of torque and abuse so give it another look for cracks or fatigue.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still a problem? Get an experienced rider that is comfortable descending to ride your wheel. Find a nice straight descent with no traffic.</p>

"Stationary bike ""clicks"" when pedaling - crank axle is moving sideways. How can I fix this?

This is highly annoying, as there's nothing I seem to be able to do about it.</p>

<p>I diagnosed the fault as per: the pedal crank axle moves sideways by about 1mm every revolution of the cranks.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to fix it though. I was googling around for different types of bottom brackets, but this bike seems to use some custom one.</p>

<p>There's a nice diagram of all the parts involved on the last pages of the <a href=""http://www.yorkfitness.com/instructiondownloads/Exercise%20Cycles_Anniversary%20c202%20Cycle_instructions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF manual</a>.</p>

<p>The C Clips are inserted into grooves on the axle itself, so I can't move them - it seems logical that it should be possible to either move the bearings further apart (screw them out of the frame by 1mm) or put some ""placeholder"" between the C Clip and the bearing. </p>

<p>However - the C Clip rotates against the bearing, so it wouldn't be a secure fit for any contraption.</p>

<p>Can you advise? How can I fix this? I imagine I'd need some special tools for the job, which ones will I need? </p>
","<p>The bike has individual cartridge bearings -- not at all standard for a ""real"" bike, and a bit unusual for even an exercise bike.  (In fact, though I've seen a half-dozen different types of exercise bikes taken apart I've never seen anything like this.)</p>

<p>But it's not a terribly complicated setup.  The C-clips hold the axle in place.  The ring against which the C-clips ride is the inner race of the bearing and rotates with the axle.  If you can find a bushing (washer) of a suitable diameter and thickness it can be inserted between the C-clip and the bearing -- fairly easily accomplished by someone with moderate mechanical abilities.  You should only need the bushing on one side.  The one thing to be wary of is to get the crank arm back on tight, as a loose crank arm quickly destroys the mating surfaces.</p>

<p>A well-equipped hardware store should have a selection of bushings (and some spare C-clips, should the one on there be damaged or go flying across the room).</p>

<p>(There is also an old mechanic's trick:  You could work some coarse string into the gap, twisting it around the axle several times.  It should stay in place fairly well, without anything to secure it, especially if you dab on a little grease or petrolatum.)</p>

<li>Bulky and heavy.</li>
<li>Only one can per tyre.</li>
<li>Wouldn't be suitable for some punctures and would be a waste if you didn't realise this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This fix may work for a long time, dependent on the sealant and whether it degrades. Silicon sealants do not degrade quickly.</p>

<p>This type of system is good for small punctures where you can quickly identify the cause and eliminate it. If you have a large puncture (such as a tear or a cut) the sealant may not be able to effectively seal it and once the air leaks you would not be able to re-inflate it.</p>

<p>Also it's best practice to ensure you remove the cause of the puncture before inflating a flat tyre. This generally involves removing the tube and checking the tyre so you're not actually saving that much.. If you don't do this you may get a subsequent puncture.</p>

<p>If you are that adverse to fixing a tyre in the rain or at night use a preventative treatment rather than a temporary repair such as this. Use slime tubes (or fill tubes with slime) or move to tubeless and use a sealant such as Stan's. I ride single track twice a week and have put a single scoop of Stan's in each tubeless wheel 6 months ago and have yet had to remove the tyre. I occasionally add air (probably a month ago and this week) so I know I have a leak somewhere but it hasn't required me to fix it yet.</p>

"Can I drop-in a compact crank set with my current 105 groupset","7523","","<p>I live near a lot of hills and am fairly new to biking.  In my lowest gear I still can't keep up at an efficient pedal rate on the hills.

<p>Can I simply replace my old crank set (Shimano 105 5600, 53/39) with a new 56xx or 57xx compact crank?  I'd expect to have to take a few links out of my chain too, but other than than can I keep my shifter and derailleur?</p>
","<p>You are right to say that the compact crankset will give you smaller gears to help you get over hills.</p>

<p>You can do a straight swap of the crankset, everything else will be compatible, although will need readjustment.</p>

<p>If you currently have a 5600 crankset, then you are absolutely safe to swap for another 5600 (compact) crankset. Now, the compatibility between different Shimano ranges is governed by the number of sprockets on the cassette, and the good news for you is that both 5600 and 5700 are 10-speed. So, basically, 5600 or 5700 cranksets will fit you perfectly (as would any other Shimano 10-speed road crankset).</p>

<p>5800 is an 11-speed system, you could probably get away with using this crankset (since the differences are small), but it will not fit as perfectly as 5600/5700. </p>

<p>So, looking at <a href=""http://cycle.shimano-eu.com/publish/content/global_cycle/en/nl/index/components/road/105_5700/product.-code-FC-5750-S.-type-..html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shimanio's site</a>, the part you need is either the FC-5750, or the FC-5650. The ""50"" appears to denote compact.</p>

<p>Lastly, do you know what length your cranks are? It might be worth measuring this just so that you get the same length with the new crankset. (You'll see on the Shimano site that things are available in four different lengths, the differences between each are small but they will affect your fit.) Here's an example of what you're measuring:</p>

In the process, decided/realized that I also need to replace my cables and housing (@mikes was right in <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/12445/do-i-need-better-springs-on-my-disc-brakes"">his answer to a past question of mine</a>).  </p>

<p>In surfing the 'net I see that I can get compressionless cable housing or ""regular"" cable housing.  Compressionless seems to be preferred by folks interested in higher levels of performance.</p>

<p>That said, I have always trusted Sheldon Brown's advice on a variety of bike related topics.  He <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/cables.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">seems to say</a> that compressionless housing is made for (and should only be used for) indexed shifters and it might be dangerous to use it for brakes.  However, there are several vendors (<a href=""http://jagwire.com/index.php/products/v/road_pro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>),(<a href=""http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_175267_-1___202417"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a>) who sell compressionless housing made specifically for brakes.  </p>

<p>So, is Sheldon wrong?  Will I be introducing additional risk in my braking system by using them? Will compressionless cable housings make a significant difference in the performance of my mechanical disc brakes?</p>
","<p>I recently upgraded my brake cables with some Jagwire of the compressionless variety. jm2 is correct in saying the steel housing is reinforced with kevlar to prevent the longitudinal wires from buckling. The performance is very good and my brakes are far more responsive than with the old, traditional spiral-wound housing that was there before.</p>

<p>That said, installation is made a bit more tricky because:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cable is not as flexy (it's a lot thicker than gear housing) so lengths must be cut appropriatly and secured well with the correct ferrules/end caps.</li>
<li>It is very difficult to cut. I tried first with a proper, full-size hack saw to get a smooth cut and it was immediately blunted. They must use very hard steel. I then just used some high-quality wire cutters which just about did the job and I smoothed up the cuts with a file. Make sure you have decent cutters if you're using compressionless.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's also debatable whether compressionless is needed for brakes. It's needed for gears as they are indexed so need precise cable draw for a given shifter movement. Brakes have no such need, if you need more caliper movement just squeeze the lever a bit more. It probably gives some finer modulation but I reckon most of the improvements I experienced were just due to new cable vs 8-year-old ropey cable.</p>

"MTB Why are 29ers considered better then the legacy 26'' or 27'' tires?","7512","","<p>this is my first time here however I am a long time stackexchange user.
I am planning to get a new MTB. Haven't ride for a long time 10y ago, as a kid I was always riding a MTB (I had an old low budget MTB and I don't want to ride it anymore).</p>

<p>I was considering to get this bike:<br>

<p>As you can see it's a 29er. Basicly I wanted to get 27.5 or 26 however at every store at my country they are telling me that 29ers are the best.<br>
Can anyone of you more experienced users tell me why should I prefer 29'' tires?</p>

<p>Also what can you tell me about the bike? I don't have much experience since my last ride on a mtb was about 10y ago.</p>

<p>This bike is 720eu at my country and I am getting it at a 20% (570eu) discount and this is as high as possible for my budget.
So am i getting something worthy for the price?</p>
","<p>I recently got into mountain biking (last summer) and I had to find the answers to all these same types of questions. The answer to your question is not a simple one. You actually have to answer a few more questions before you can know which is the right size wheel for you.</p>

<p>First of all you won't want anything smaller than 26"". You won't be able to roll over a lot of obstacles without a decent sized wheel. The benefit of the 26"" wheels is that they tend to be more maneuverable, they weigh the least amount and thus roll faster, and if you are not a tall person then the 26"" will be easier to find a frame that fits you right.</p>

<p>The 29"" wheel allows you to go over more obstacles more easily. They are great if you have long legs. And they are less likely to be suddenly stopped by obstructions.</p>

<p>Then there are the 27.5"" wheels. The brand Giant actually did a lot of research on these and have pegged them as the best compromise between the 26"" and the 29"". They tend to be closer to the 26"" when it comes to weight and speed. But closer to the 29"" when it comes to angle of attack and the ability to go over obstacles.</p>

<p>Last summer I started out with a 26"" hybrid on the trails (yes I said hybrid, it is what I had to work with at the time). I rode with two friends that had real mountain bikes. One had a 26"" and the other a 29er. Riding a hybrid definitely held me back.</p>

<p>But I did get a chance to ride both of their bikes and what I found is that it is essential to have a bike that is built for mountain biking when you do this. Both felt smooth as butter compared to the hybrid. Both performed well.</p>

<p>My friend Josh that had the 29er had an easier time going down some rock steps and over some obstacles. But Bill, the one with the 26er, was able to climb more quickly. That said, Bill is also a lighter person than Josh. So that probably added to the differences.</p>

<p>Overall I think the experience with both was about the same. It was really just having an actual mountain bike with strong parts and good derailleurs that mattered the most.</p>

<p>However I will say this, if you are going to spend a good amount of time on paved trails too then you will want to consider the lighter, faster wheels (26 or 27.5). If you are shorter or a low weight person then the large 29ers might require to much of your energy to pedal.</p>

<p>In the end, even though I am not that tall (5'7"") I ended up with a 29er that I purchased recently. I did this because I have large strong legs and wanted to go over the obstacles more easily. I think in the end it is more preference though.</p>

<p>Also, Giant has invested a lot into the 27.5"" bikes. So they might be worth a look since they have lots of confidence in them.</p>

","<p>One-wheeled trailers are more agile and don't increase the width of your bike.  They lean with the bike. If you're going to go really narrow places, you need one-wheel.</p>

<p>Two-wheeled trailers can generally carry more weight and are less prone to making the bike fall over when you stop.</p>

<p>So, what are you going to do with the trailer?  Going up and down mountains with narrow trails: get a one-wheeled trailer. Carrying 50kg of equipment from the hardware store home using streets and wide paths: get a two-wheeled trailer.</p>

"Does my bottom bracket need replacing?","7487","","<p>About two months ago I bought a Boardman HT Comp. Today I took it into my local bike shop for a service. While I was in the shop one of the technicians had a quick look at it and told me that my bottom bracket needs replacing. All he did was push and pull the cranks from side to side. There was a clicking noise and some visible movement, nothing more than 1-2mm. I've not noticed any problems while on the bike, however I don't have enough riding experience to know what to look for. Is it really possible that after 2 months and this very quick assessment that my bottom bracket needs replacing?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>Eight months down the line it's failed again.</p>
","<p>If it's only 2 months old, they have to replace the broken part in guarantee for free. Isn't it?</p>

<p>Anyways I checked the specs, this bike has Truvativ Firex GXP crankset. It has integrated bearing, so it should not move side to side. The clicking noise usually means loose or damaged bottom bracket. First I would try to reinstall the crankset with correct lubrication and optimal torque. And if it does not help, it has to be replaced.</p>

","<p>For downtube shifters, I prefer to run as little housing as possible.  Your best bet is to look for some new old stock (NOS) vintage parts.  You need two bits: a chainstay-clamping housing stop for the short housing loop to the rear derailleur, and a downtube-clamping cable guide for making the cable bend at the bottom bracket up towards the front derailleur and back towards the rear derailleur along the chainstay.</p>

"Using Anti Seize in place of Grease","7466","","<p>I bought Nickel Anti-Seize to prevent any corrosion issues between metals, and I generally like using it on my vehicles on bolts and anything I plan on removing later.

<li>Spoke nipples (need loctite or nipple prep in this case, don't want the nipples to loosen)</li>

Use it pretty much any place metal parts are pressed together.You want to avoid the threads of critical fasteners as it can allow them to loosen over time.On quick release skewers antisieze on the shaft is ok,but avoid the threaded portion.Also avoid the clamp sections of the stem,you want a tight grip between the stem and the bars and the stem and the steerer tube.I guess the easiest way to think about where to use is any place that has a close tolerence fit that is subject to corrosion but in everyday use doesn't move.</p>

"How can I stop a belt brake (band brake) from squealing?","7433","","<p>One of our bikes is an electric bike.  It's an older <a href=""http://www.izipusa.com/26-izip-hg1000-electric-bike.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iZip HG 1000</a>, and although we got it through the American ""manufacturer"" (<a href=""http://www.currietech.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Currie Technologies</a>), like most of the low-end ebikes it's made in China of heavy steel and uses cheap, cheap, cheap components.</p>

<p>The rear brake is called a belt brake or band brake.  When I was researching this a bit, I came across a discussion that said this type of brake is something like 20 cents cheaper than V-Brakes to manufacture in bulk, which is why it shows up on this type of bike.</p>

<p>Here's a couple pics: just the brake and then one mounted on a bike (not our bike):</p>

<p>Actually, now that I look closely at the pictures, I can see part of why it's cheap - no special frame fittings needed.  The donut-shaped ""drum"" mounts to the hub, the other piece just fits over that drum and is clamped to the seat stay.</p>

<p>My problem is that the thing squeals like a banshee.  There's no pad adjustment as there would be for cantilevers, the only adjustment is how tight the belt starts.  If I loosen it enough to stop the squealing, there's not enough pull to actually stop the bike.</p>

<p>Is there any adjustment I could do to get rid of the squealing?</p>
","<p>That style of drum brake relies on friction between steel and leather. If it is setup to stop reasonably well, they will always make some noise. Quite often, when new, they do indeed howl like Baoine Sidhe. </p>

<p>This will get better with use. From the photos, it appears your brakes are fairly new? Assuming that they are actual photos of your bike...</p>

<p>Rubbing talcum powder into the leather strap will help quiet the brake, but it may also have an adverse effect on your braking performance. Best to let it work out naturally, with time and use. </p>

"Can I increase my highest gear ratio?","7426","","<p>I have a modern bike (ridgeback meteor '13) and It currently has a 21 speed shimano chainset. 
I find that going down hills (which I do a lot) and on flats I need a higher gear. 
Can I do anything to get a higher gear ratio (such as a bigger large chainring) or am I already at the top?</p>

<p>Spec:
48/38/28 Chainrings
12-32 (7 Speed) Cassette:</p>
","<p>You probably can't fit a bigger front chainring on that bike due to the front derailleur and chain issues. They do make 11 toothed 7 speed cassettes which you can install (but I doubt you'll gain anything from it due to the second point I want to make on cadence), which will give you a bit higher gearing but the spacing between the cogs (i.e. the number of teeth) will be worse. Note that a higher gear ratio isn't always advisable, since you need to remain in control of the bike at speed as well (there isn't really engine braking, like there is on a car, in a derailleur system). Also, if you're commuting, you don't want to be going so fast that you get drenched in sweat when you get to your destination, so speed isn't everything. </p>

<p>However, chances are you need to increase your cadence: <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/gears/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheldonbrown.com/gears/</a> says that at a 60 rpm cadence, you should be doing 19-20 mph in the 48t front, 12t back combo, which should be enough (the 700cx37 tires aren't on his calculator, but 35 and 38 are close enough). Your cadence might change if you're in an improper riding position (e.g. seat too high/low or weird handlebar positions). </p>

<p>EDIT: The tire size on this bike should be 700c x 42. But the point still stands (the speeds should be slightly higher at the given cadence, since increasing the tire size also increases the gearing). </p>

<p>You should also make sure your bike is tuned up (you may feel sluggish if your hubs are due for a repacking or your brakes are dragging on the rims or your tire pressure is too low, for example). </p>

<p>If your cadence is already sufficiently high for some reason, time to get a road bike then (which will probably be lighter and more aerodynamic and have higher gearing (both at the bottom and top end)). Note that there will be a geometry change, even if you go with a flat bar road bike, probably, so if you choose to go this route, make sure to get fit. What you've got is a pretty heavy (~30 lbs, which is fine for its intended purpose) and cheap hybrid which is designed to be a commuter - it isn't really worth pumping money into it to improve it, but only to fix the things which are broken and add things useful for commuting, such as lights or switching to slick tires (which you presumably already have). </p>

"Why Do I Need a Better/Lighter Road Bicycle to Train For 'Fitness'?","7377","","<p>I'm about to purchase a bicycle in the very near future and have been shopping around at different bike shops to see what I like and what they offer.</p>

<p>My primary goal here is to commute to work.  It's a 6 mile / 9.5 km ride (each way).  It's all paved road, mostly bike lanes, for the duration of the trip.  And that's what I tell the sales people.</p>

<p>Twice now, I've been asked if I intended to use my bicycle for 'fitness'.  And when I say, 'Well, sure, maybe it'd be nice to do that too...' the salesman points me away from the bigger 'commuter' bicycles and towards the smaller road bicycles (one said a road 'cruiser' would be best, the other just suggested a 'road' bicycle).  </p>

<p>I didn't think anything of it until I was at home - but now it's bothering me.  How does having a lighter, more efficient bicycle, that promotes a more aerodynamic position ENCOURAGE fitness?  Isn't that the exact opposite?</p>

<p>Surely for any given course/distance the cyclist with the heavier, less efficient, bicycle would be working <em>harder</em>.  I'm not a cyclist, but I do know if you go to the gym and use a stationary bicycle the more resistance you have the harder the workout.  </p>

<p>What am I missing?  Would you not get a much better workout on a heavy bike with an extra 70 pounds and sitting in an upright position....than on a top-of-the-line road bicycle?</p>

<p>Or is it just a reason to get me into a higher price-range?</p>
","<p>Rob, you are correct that a heavier bike will give you a greater fitness benefit over the same distance.</p>

<p>The only real counter-point I have is that the most effective bikes for fitness are the ones that get ridden. So, if some reason a lighter bike would more fun or appealing to you (while still be a ""good enough"" commuter), than a lighter bike could be a better choice for you. </p>

<p>In my experience, extra weight is not noticed much for commuting, so I'd rather have the durability of CroMoly over aluminum or carbon, and the practical benefits of fenders, racks, lights and bags.</p>

<p>An anecdote: My wife rides a bike with electric assist. You might think electric assist would reduce the fitness benefit, but opposite is true for her. She takes more trips because she has electric assist (including carrying one or two children plus cargo), and thus ends up riding-- and pedaling-- more than if she had an unassisted bike.</p>

<p>Some will suggest that you should get a lighter bike for ""social"" riding. That depends on who you ride with and what their fitness levels and interests are. I'm personally a stronger rider, and prefer to ride with my wife, parents and older friends, as well my children. For me, having a bike that's a bit heavier improves the social parity and helps to me ride naturally closer to the same speed with the people I prefer to ride with. If you want a hang with ""Group A"" club rides, lighter would be way the go instead. </p>

<p>Whatever gets you out riding the most is best bike for you.</p>

","<p>Like Daniel said, a good rule of thumb is to keep oils off rubber and plastics. Some will damage them, some will preserve them, but you don't want either type on your tires. You should be more worried about the fact that the oily spot on your rear tire can cause it to break traction much more easily, especially while braking or cornering. If you're going to be storing the bike for any period of time, just stuff a rag between the spokes up next to the hub to catch and absorb the oil.</p>

"What should I look for when buying a used bicycle?","7367","","<p>I'm moving to a city where I can ride a bicycle to the grocery store, coffee shop etc. I want to purchase a decent used bicycle. I'm leaning towards a bike that's in between a ""10-speed"" or road-bike and a mountain bike. <strong>What should I look for when choosing a particular bike?</strong></p>

<p>I've never purchased a used bicycle. Other than classifieds (e.g., Craigslist), what types of places can I look? What other issues should I consider, such as size, visual appearance, leaking tires, etc.? How can I make sure it's not stolen?</p>
","<p>In my area, there is a shop called <a href=""http://www.recycled-cycles.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Recycled Cycles</a>, where they buy old bikes, fix them up and resell them at a discount. When my wife and I last visited, they had quite a few vintage bikes for sale. </p>

<p>You can also take a look at pawn shops, and if you live near a college/university, the campus police may hold a bike auction near the beginning of the school year. Our department collects abandoned bikes at the end of the spring semester and sell them the next calendar year (giving the owners time to come back and claim them). We usually have 60 or more bikes up for auction, ranging from rust buckets to almost brand new Treks.</p>

"Kick-stand on a commuter bike?","7360","","<p>If I get <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2767/what-bikeequipment-for-a-long-daily-urban-commute"">this commuter bike</a>, should it have <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/573/whats-your-most-useful-cycle-accessory/576#576"">a kick-stand</a>?</p>

<p>One LBS said ""no"": they explained that stands are difficult to attach, weigh a bit, don't stay on well, and/or scratch the frame.</p>

<p>I've never had a bike without a stand. A lot of my parking will be locking to a <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/bug/combat_theft.htm#post_rings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">post-and-ring device like this</a>.</p>

<p>If your bike doesn't have a kick-stand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why not?</li>
<li>How do you park it without one? Can you just lean your bike up against whatever you're locking it to? If so, doesn't it roll and fall over easily? Do you only/mostly park it in the kind of rack where you push a wheel into a vertical slot which holds it upright?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Whether a bike has a kickstand is really a personal decision, but what the frame is made of is important. If you're not concerned with scratching the frame, and the frame is reasonable sturdy, then get yourself a kickstand; it'll make the bike more usable, and that's what's important. (I wouldn't attach a kickstand to, say, a carbon frame or a bike with a nice paint job I wanted to keep intact, but most of my bikes have them.) </p>

<p>When your LBS told you that ""kickstands don't stay on well"", what that means to me is that they're either using bad kickstands, or they don't attach them well. However, there are some bikes that won't fit well with a kickstand (such as many folding bikes and racing bikes). However, a commuter bike that won't take a kickstand isn't nearly as useable as one that will. </p>

<p>I don't have kickstands on my touring bikes, because one is a folding bike and the other is a diamond-frame touring bike. The latter will take a kickstand, but I removed it because a bike with a full touring load won't really stay put with a kickstand. I ended up getting a gadget called a click-stand that's essentially a tentpole with a thing on the end that hooks onto the frame, and also comes with a pair of brake bands (they do just what you'd think). Unfortunately, it takes a minute to deploy and isn't suitable for everyday use, but it perfect for touring. </p>

<p>A bike without a kickstand can be parked by leaning it against a railing, or the end of a bike rack, or even lying it on its side on the ground if you're not locking it up. You can use cable locks combined with a sturdy lock such as a U-lock (or even a bungee cord combined with a lock) to keep the bike steady. My kickstand-less bikes have bungee cords that live on the rear racks for this purpose. </p>

<p>If you want a kickstand, do a little research and order one and attach it. If you're concerned about scratching the paint (you will), you can cut up an old tube and use it to protect the frame. Don't tighten it so much that you crush the frame, but check it every so often and make certain it's reasonably tight. </p>

"Brake callipers not long enough to allow adjustment of pads","7354","","<p>I upgraded the standard Tektro brakes on my <a href=""http://archive.sebikes.com/archivebike.php?prodid=1306&amp;prodname=700C%20Lager"" rel=""noreferrer"">SE Lager</a> to Shimano 105s. The braking performance is vastly improved. I also have Charge Plug wheels, rather than the stock wheels.</p>

<p>However I've noticed that there's not quite enough adjustment in the calipers to position the pads correctly. Even at the lowest position in the caliper arms, the pads are still very slightly too 'high' and overlap the upper curve of the rim.</p>

<p>Is this a problem? Is there anything I can do to solve it?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qrz8n.jpg"" alt=""Brake location""></p>
","<p>Those pads do look ever-so slightly too high on the rim, the main danger being that any slight vertical eccentricity could result in the pad contacting the tire and causing a blowout.</p>

<p>There are two main solutions:</p>

<p>Firstly, you could use a round file and simply file out the bottom of the slot slightly to increase the clearance.  This works best if you only need a very small amount of additional reach and are willing to accept permanently modifying your brakes.</p>

<p>Secondly, you could buy a set of brakes with a longer reach.  The Shimano 105mm calipers are 39-49mm <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/calipers.html#reach"">reach</a>; if you instead purchase some higher-quality dual pivot calipers that are 47-57mm reach you'd have plenty of room for adjustment and should be able to achieve equally good braking capability.</p>

"Bike not changing correctly between two gears","7350","","<p>I have only recently started riding to work and I've been given a bike by a friend which is in reasonably good shape.</p>

<p>For the way things are working out I keep the front gear in the same position and change the back one between 4, 5 and 6.</p>

<p>The trip is very hilly so I like to switch over to 6 as I near the top of a hill so I can continue pedaling as soon as possible at the base of the next hill.</p>

<p>However, the bike changes quite readily between all other gears 1 - 5, except going up from 5 to 6. Going down 6 - 5 works fine. This means more effort when trying to go up the next hill. Sometimes the gear kicks in just before I want to switch back down to 5 again.</p>

<p>There is also a 7th gear on the back that I don't use, so the 6th is not the highest choice.</p>

<p>This problem occurs regardless of if I'm going up, down or on a flat grade. It also doesn't help if I try switching back down to 5 and trying again, it just seems to kick in randomly.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what I can see could be causing this.</p>
","<p>How many miles on this bike?  If over 5000 miles (8000km) then your rear gear cluster may be worn out.  Your symptoms are most strongly suggestive of that.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the first thing to do is to clean the derailer real well.  Lean the bike against a wall (derailer facing you) outside somewhere where a few oil stains won't be a problem.  Shove some newspaper or cardboard up behind the derailer and drape it over the tire, to keep stuff from dripping on the tire.  Then spray the derailer well with a spray solvent (WD40 in the US) and scrub it with an old toothbrush.  Dry the derailer well with an old rag, and lubricate with chain oil.</p>

<p>With the derailer clean, swivel it back and forth by hand and notice if it seems to be twisting in parallel with the chain and sprockets or is perhaps bent so that it goes at an angle.  If it seems bent (which happens from dropping the bike on its side) then the ""derailer hanger"" probably needs to be straightened.</p>

<p>Also, pay attention to the shifters and cables.  A little spray lube in the shifters and down the shifter cable housings is generally all that's needed here, unless the cables are badly corroded or beginning to fray, in which case they need to be replaced.  Be careful, though, about what sort of lube you put on the shifters as most now have plastic components that can be damaged by strong solvents.</p>

<p>And, of course, it's probably time to adjust the derailer, but that a whole different post.</p>

"Why are puncture-resistant tires not used in professional races?","7350","","<p>Having used with great satisfaction puncture-resistant tires for more than 8 years, and having seen how it can happen than in professional races tires can be punctured, I wonder why are puncture-resistant tires not used from team racing in Giro d'Italia or Tour de France. </p>

<p>I am sure it is not for economic reason, but I cannot figure why.</p>
","<p>To a racer, rolling resistance and handling top the list; durability is far down the list. The coefficient of rolling resistance (Crr) for a racing tire on typical French or Italian roads used during a Grand Tour is about .004, or even lower. The Crr of a puncture resistant tire can be > .01. Crr scales like gradient, so the difference between Crr's of .01 and .004 is like constantly climbing a slope of .006 (=.01 - .004), or slightly more than half a percent. On a 150km stage that's like climbing an extra 900m hill. No racer willingly gives up that much advantage, especially when there's wheel support from either a team car or neutral support should you get a flat.</p>

"What effect does changing the stem length have on my bikes handling","7325","","<p>I'm finding that when jumping my mountain bike seems to be very nose heavy no matter how far back my saddle is. What effect will moving to a shorter stem length have?</p>

<p>My bike, a Boardman FS-PRO came with a 100mm Richey stem. I think that moving to a shorter stem length will allow me, and my short arms, to sit further back on the bike and hopefully make steep dropoffs a bit easier to ride. I've heard that shorter stems make the steering quicker too. Will this make my bike unrideable?</p>
","<p>A shorter stem does make your steering quicker, it also enables you to sit more upright and gives more leverage on the handlebar.</p>

<p>The longer stem gets you more forward and in a better position for climbing but I think it makes low speed steering awkward and is uncomfortable for long stretches on the bike.</p>

<p>I went from some ungodly long stem (100+mm) with a flat bar to a 50 mm stem with a small riser bar on my Rockhopper and I'm much happier riding it now.  Pulling up the front wheel is much easier (and of course this helps big time with hopping/jumping).  Also riding off larger drops is easier since you it is easier to hang over the rear of the bike as well.</p>

<p>If you're primarily dirt jumping and free riding, I'd say go with the short stem.   Honestly the only scenario where I would consider going back to the long stem is if I decided to start doing a lot of XC riding involving lots of climbs (NO THANKS!).</p>

","<p>In case of inner tube, difference between 1.90 and 1.95 is totally negligible. The tubes will be completely interchangeable.</p>

<p>Rather than carrying a few spare tubes on your bike at all times, experienced riders most often carry only one spare tube + patch kit.

"Can a front wheel have a different number of bearings on each side?","7323","","<p>I took my old, filthy bike apart to clean it up.  I have never done this before!</p>

<p>When I took the front wheel bearings out, I ended up retrieving 9 from one side and 10 from the other.</p>

<p>It seems like logically there are a few explanations:</p>

<ol>
<li>There were actually 10 each side but I dropped one without noticing.</li>
<li>It's designed to have a different number on each side.</li>
<li>It's not designed to have a different number on each side, but the bike shop put it together wrong and I've somehow got away with it over the years.</li>
</ol>

<p>I honestly think I was being super careful and that it's not (1), but I'm prepared to accept it could be that if the others are impossible!</p>

<p>And I guess in practical terms, what I really need to know is ... should I put it back together with 9 on one side, or should I buy some new bearings so I have 10 each side?  I think I read somewhere that 10 each side is standard for a front wheel.</p>
","<p>It's not unusual for an asymmetric shaft (on some rear wheels or solid-crank bottom brackets, eg) to have different numbers of balls in one side vs the other. But it's a little unusual for a standard front hub.  And if there's intentionally a difference then there would be a small but visible difference in the size of the races as well.</p>

<p>Likely the hub was serviced in the past and one ball was lost (or you lost one somehow).  But it's not really terribly serious.  It's often recommended (as a general rule for ball bearings) to have ""a full race minus one"" vs having the race completely full, and your typical 10-ball bearing can survive reasonably missing 2-3 balls (though that's not ideal).</p>

<p>However, since you have things apart it would be worthwhile to replace the balls.  (Don't mix old and new balls.)  See if ten fit comfortably.  If they fit, and there's still room for a fingernail between them, then use ten, otherwise go with nine.</p>

One additional point that is worth mentioning: to buy another bicycle for that specific purpose is not an option.</p>

<p>Said that, the question would be: how can I (temporarily) convert my mountain bike into a touring bike?</p>
","<p>Mountain bikes have been pressed into service as touring machines for a long time. Old hardtail mountain bikes make great, bristly touring machines, and they're fun to ride. </p>

<h2>Tires</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll want to look at are the tires. Most mountain bikes come with knobby tires for riding on dirt and gravel. A set of slicks or semi-slick tires will decrease rolling resistance. Tires with tread on the sides are also good for this. </p>

<h2>Carrying stuff</h2>

<p><a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/1862/8"">Racks</a>: A sturdy rear rack <em>and</em> a front rack are the best way to go for long-term use. Be aware that a suspension fork can make fitting a front rack difficult, but there <em>are</em> racks made to accomodate this. (Old Man Mountain racks are amazingly sturdy and work with suspension forks, but they're not cheap or light.) Rear racks are only a problem if you have a full-suspension bike. </p>

<p>You may be tempted to put only a rear rack on the bike. This will still allow you to carry a good amount of cargo, but the shorter wheelbase of a mountain bike (compared to a proper touring or cyclocross bike) will encourage wheelies while climbing hills with a load, so be careful. </p>

<p>If your bike doesn't have the fittings for racks, <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/571#571"">hose clamps</a> are a handy way to get around that. </p>

<p>It may be easier to buy or borrow a trailer for touring. You can get a cargo trailer, or find a kid/pet trailer and convert it. These can often be found at yard sales or on craigslist inexpensively. A trailer also means you can skip buying <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/402/80"">panniers</a>. </p>

<h2>Handlebars</h2>

<p>You may find the flat bars of a mountain bike onerous while riding for hours and hours. A pair of barends will help here. I recommend the large, curved kind that allow you to sit more upright. </p>

<h2>Other stuff</h2>

<p>For a single trip, this would be overkill, but if you decide to do more touring on this bike, look into getting a decent touring <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/2812/8"">saddle</a> that you can sit on for hours on end, or even a Brooks. </p>

<p>Getting <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/2803/8"">fenders</a> for a single trip is, similarly, probably not needed, and many mountain bikes would be tricky to fit them on. But there are partial fenders you can mount on your downtube that might help. (Or you could make one out of cardboard and zip ties, it'd probably last you the weekend and then some.) </p>

<p>I toured several times using an old mountain bike; here it is, with Tubus racks and four panniers and a camping roll: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/2459688521/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""100_7014.JPG by neilfein, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3175/2459688521_77ab3677f8.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""100_7014.JPG""></a></p>

<p>Double-check your brakes before heading out; enough stopping power to bring you and the bike to a halt might not be enough when you add on the weight of camping gear and clothing and a beat-up guitar for the campfire. </p>

<p>Mountain bike tourers aren't <em>quite</em> as comfortable as dedicated touring bikes, but the fun of being able to hop onto the dirt outweighs that. You may be a little slower than a touring bike, but even with your slick tires, you'll smoke those guys on gravel trails. Have fun! </p>

","<p>My guess is that the chain is too tight. You say it is only at a specific spot in the rotation which leads me to believe your chainring being slightly off center (I have not found one 100% perfect) is causing the popping. </p>

<p>Flip the bike on it's back and spin the cranks slowly. If it is a freewheel pedal, it backwards since this will not engage the sprocket. If it is a coaster, you will have to pedal it forwards. If you notice the chain get really tight then loose as you do this, adjust your chain. Find the same spot the pedals are at where it gets the tightest and loosen then tighten the rear wheel with the cranks in the same spot so that the tightest it will get is where you just set it.</p>

<p>If the chain tension was not the problem, you might need to check the bearings. Huffys almost never have sealed bearings and they can be over under tightened, either being a problem.</p>

"Tubular Glue vs Tubular Tape","7274","","<p>I'm looking into going for tubular tyres and I'm new to this part of the world. As far as I understand there are two main options to mount the tyre:</p>

<p><strong>1. Tube Glue</strong> which kind of a pain in the ass time-wise and requires some effort, but seems like a very solid solution to fix the tyre to the rim.</p>

<p><strong>2. Tube Tape</strong> like the one from <a href=""http://road.cc/content/review/18602-velox-jantex-tubular-tape"">Velox</a>, which seems like a very easy and fast way to mount the tyre but for me personally it doesn't seem rock solid.</p>

<p>Can anyone with the experience of using both explain pros and cons of these methods.</p>

<p>Thank you guys! You're the best!!</p>
","<p>I've glued hundreds of tubulars and learned the craft from some of the best mechanics in the sport including a former wrench with the Motorola team and a former Mavic Service Course mechanic. These days tubulars are really only used in cyclocross, track and at the very top level of the sport. </p>

<p>There are some very distinct downsides:</p>

<ol>
<li>Safety. Improperly glued tubulars can roll off in a corner. This is not to be taken lightly. Even top pros have rolled tubulars (Joseba Beloki famously went down hard in the 2003 Tour de France, effectively ending his career) On a long descent dragging your brakes can heat up the rim enough to soften the glue resulting in a rolled tire. </li>
<li>Expense. A decent tubular costs significantly more than a good clincher.</li>
<li>Repair. You can't patch a tubular during a ride. You pretty much have to replace the entire tire. This means you need to carry at least one spare tire per ride (and hope you don't get more than one flat!) This BTW pretty much negates any weight savings which are trivial to begin with.</li>
<li>Hassle. Mounting tubulars is a multi-day process, especially if you're mounting them on bare rims for the first time. Getting the tire onto the rim is significantly more difficult than mounting even the toughest clincher. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all that said if you're going to move forward I strongly suggest using mastik instead of tape. Tape isn't that much less messy and the bond seems to be less consistent then a good gluing job. </p>

<p>Park Tool has as good a guide as any on mounting tubulars as anyone: <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/tubular-tire-gluing"">http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/tubular-tire-gluing</a></p>

<p>A few other tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do NOT use 3M Fast Tack! Some people swear by the stuff. I've personally seen several tires roll from using it. This is especially true with Continental tubulars. Fast Tack actually dissolves the glue that holds the base tape to the tubular casing. Someone a few years back did a study on tubular cements and Fast Tack did very poorly (<a href=""http://kuktl.dept.ku.edu/bicycle/Cusa1.pdf"">http://kuktl.dept.ku.edu/bicycle/Cusa1.pdf</a>) Stick to Continental or Vittoria. </li>
<li>Mount the tires to a clean rim, inflate them to high pressure (120+ psi) and let them sit for a while (as in several days). This will make it much easier to mount them. </li>
<li>People will tell you to put a foot in the tubular and then pull up until you hear a popping sound. They claim this is stretching the tire to make it fit easier. These people are idiots. The popping your hearing is the base tape detaching from the casing or threads in the casing tearing. Don't do this! </li>

"Why is there a distinction between friction and indexed derailleurs?","7265","","<p>I've seen people make a distinction between a derailleur being for friction or indexed.</p>

<p>Is this distinction somehow functional? I can't see how it could be, because every derailleur I've ever seen just takes a movement in the cable and translates it into a movement in the cage.</p>
","<p>With an indexed shifter, each gear change moves a fixed amount of cable. The rear derailer is supposed to move a certain distance (the distance between cogs) for each fixed amount of cable pulled.</p>

<p>There is the fact about some sram levers not working with shimano shifters and vice-versa, and that's because each brand works with a different amount of cable pull per shift.</p>

<p>If you have a friction shifter, you can pull any amount you want, so you'll always be able to get the right derailer position for a given gear (of course, given your shifter covers the required range), and in this case you could use any suitable derailer.</p>

<p>So, the distinction you mention has to do with compatibility between a given derailer and a given indexed shifter. If you match them wrong, shifting would be very disfunctional (I've seen it happen).</p>

<p>Besides that, it would be theoretically possible to use a non-indexed derailer with a given indexed shifter, but only if they happen to have the same cable-displacement-to-lateral-displacement ratio.</p>

"What tools are required to replace a spoke?","7261","","<p>When out riding at the weekend, for the very first time, I managed to break a spoke on my wheel.</p>

<p>Because I've not done it before, and I want to get back out on the bike soon, this time around I am minded just to hand the job over to my LBS. However, I do like to do my own maintenance where I can, so was thinking about what tools I would need to be able to do the job myself in future.</p>

<p>I'm thinking I would need a spoke wrench, a truing stand and a spoke tension meter. But would I need anything else? Or are any of these items unnecessary?</p>

<p>As a follow on question, this was a spoke on the drive side of a rear wheel that was bought just 9 months ago as part of a new (and expensive) <a href=""http://www.ffwdwheels.com/products/wheels/road-carbon-alloy-clincher/f6r-c-dt240/"" rel=""nofollow"">wheelset</a>, and has done something like 1500km so far. The roads I was riding on were far from perfect, but I don't particularly remember hitting any potholes. Was I just unlucky or should I be concerned?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I've now replaced the spoke myself with no hassle whatsoever. Thanks to all three respondents, every answer was good - a spoke wrench was the only tool required. I estimated the correct tension by plucking the spokes and made sure the wheel was approximately true just using the frame.</p>

<p>The only other thing to note was that, having decided to replace the spoke like-for-like, the particular spoke was very difficult to get hold of singly. In the end I ordered from an <a href=""http://www.wheelbuilder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">online shop</a> in the US (I'm in the UK). I did approach my LBS but the best they could do was to order a box of 72 spokes for me which pushed the cost right up. I had a chat with the mechanic there who said that this was quite a common problem...</p>
","<p>If its just one spoke, and you are after functional, not perfection, all you would need it a spoke wrench. If its the right hand side of the rear wheel, you will need to remove the cluster so need tools for that. Tourers often/usually carry spare spokes and can replace them on the side of the road if needed, so you don't need all the gear the LBS has (although it sure makes things easier).....</p>

<p>The actual task for replacement is straight forward (in theory) - replace the spoke, re-install the wheel on the bike and put the bike in a work stand or something so the wheel can spin (upside down is a last resort), use a zip tie on a frame member as a guide and tighten/loose spokes to true the rim.  In practice, being your first, it will take all day as every ""tweak"" you make will appear to do strange things elsewhere. The trick is slow-slowly. Take you time, no more than 1/4 turn then re-check. You might need to tweak the spokes up to a few each side of the broken one - more than that and either the wheel was not true to begin with or something else is happening..</p>

<p>I would look for reasons why the spoke failed, and consider a visit to the LBS if truing the wheel gives you a heap of trouble. </p>

<p>Does anyone know the relative benefits of each? Is the simple kind generally good enough?</p>
","<p>""Useful"" is hard to define for everyone. For me, ""useful"" tends to mean ""has a lot of uses"". The very specific chain wear-checking tools you list above are ""handy"" in that they do one thing and they do it reasonably well. Useful? Well...if you need to do it a lot and/or it is difficult.</p>

<p>But there is a tried-and-true method using a simple tool that many people already own, and which has a lot of other uses: a tape measure or ruler with inch markings. You simply align an inch mark on one side of a rivet, then look at the corresponding rivet 12 full links away. On an unworn chain, the rivet will line up exactly at 12 inches. A worn chain will be more than 12 inches. On most bicycles, you won't even need to remove the chain to do this. And it works with virtually all modern bicycle chains.</p>

<p>Chain wear in general is a bit of a ""religious"" issue, but a rule of thumb if you must have one is: within 1/16 of an inch, no problem. Between 1/16 - 1/8 of an inch, probably time to replace the chain. Past 1/8 of an inch, you've probably noticed other issues in the drivetrain.</p>

<p>This (along with many, many other chain-related issues) is summed up nicely at <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/chains.html"">Sheldon Brown's site</a> (see 'Measuring Chain Wear', towards the bottom).</p>

"What are the main differences between road saddles and mountain saddles?","7210","","<p>There are thousands of saddles out there. Some are designated as road saddles while others are mountain saddles. However, the marketing copy does not seem to describe the difference between the two types, even between two similar models (for example, Selle Italia seems to have an SLR for road bikes and an SLR XC for mountain bikes).</p>

","<p>There is a lot of variation across models of saddles even if you stay within one genre (eg only consider road or only consider MTB).</p>

<p>However, you'll find if you look at popular racing saddles that MTB saddles <em>tend</em> to be shorter. This is because in singletrack you're very frequently moving onto and off-of the saddle. A longer saddle might interfere with the ""body-english"" that some MTB riders use.</p>

<p>Side note: I like to drop and hop curbs (though I haven't even been able to attempt it on the road bike), there are frequently metal shavings or other sharp objects on my garage floor, and I live in a neighborhood with lots of cracks and potholes. Should I just give up on road bikes and stick with my mountain bike?</p>
","<p>At risk of being downvoted, you don't want want solid tires. There's a reason that all performance tires for all vehicles are pneumatic. The decrease in compliance of a solid foam or rubber tire just doesn't compare to a pneumatic tire.<br><br>
Look into a tire with kevlar reinforcement- most brands have them- or aftermarket anti-puncture tire liners that sit between the tire casing and your tube. You may even want to try a tire sealant like the one made by Stan's NoTubes, though if you're running tubes you'll need the kind with removable valve cores.<br><br>
One last thing to note is that the number of flats you're getting may depend on what part of the road you're riding on. If you're riding to the right of the white line (assuming you're in the US), ie on the shoulder then you're going to get a lot more flats. The shoulder is where all the debris accumulates even if the road looks clean. For many road riders, especially those who are just starting and don't feel comfortable riding on the road, simply switching from riding on the shoulder to riding to the outside of the actual lane alleviates a substantial portion of flat issues.</p>

"Why are electric bikes so expensive?","7149","","<p>The limited selection of electric bikes available at <a href=""http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/categorydisplay_storeId_10001_catalogId_10151_categoryId_211566_langId_-1"">Halfords</a> ranges from £699.99-£1,199.99. What makes them so expensive — the dynamo, battery, or something else?</p>
","<p>I have sold a small quantity of electric bicycles over the years (including one to a 83 year old woman). Were these profitable sales, from the bike-shop's point of view? Not really...   </p>

<p><strong>Frame + Extras</strong></p>

<p>Cost is different to price, clearly the bicycle costs more to build, e.g. in Giant's top-class Taiwan factory on a relatively limited production run. As mentioned in other answers, there is the motor, the batteries and control gear. On top of that there is also a more expensive frame. The frame has more 'braze-ons' to mount the electric running gear. It is also extra tough so that the frame and fork can survive (force = mass x acceleration and an electric bike goes quicker with extra mass). This frame/fork combination is also unique to the electric models whereas, on a normal bike, the frame may be shared across a model range.<br>
As well as the frame/fork being different, the wheels and tyres are up-rated, this may not actually cost that much more rubber and aluminium, however, these parts are model specific, limited run for the manufacturer, possibly specially made by the suppliers.<br>
As of yet there are no electric bikes that make use of the frame to carry the battery, typically this has to have a rack and extra packaging to attach it to the bicycle. These parts cost money, again they are also bespoke.<br>
The batteries can use Lithium, NiMh or even lead-acid, clearly with cost differentiation, the Lithium cells costing more.  </p>

<p>As of yet we have not left the factory with our electric bicycle, the extra parts and Far Eastern labour may not actually amount to a lot in absolute terms, however the factory-cost will be a significant multiple of the regular mass-market mountain/hybrid bicycle cost. The parts cost more as does the assembly line. </p>

<p><strong>Shipping: Weight and size</strong></p>

<p>When we come to ship the electric bicycle half-way around the world, there is approximately twice the cost, whether the shipping is priced by weight or volume. This is because the electric bicycle weighs more and needs a much bigger box (compared to a typical MTB that ships with the bars/front-wheel/seat/pedals removed and no mudguards). Interestingly there is less EU 'anti-dumping' duty on electric bikes than normal ones, so no added cost there (and if you wondered why some bikes come from Macau you now know...). Some money does have to be paid to get the boxes out of Felixstowe, on the back of the lorry and up to the warehouse, again this is slightly more than the regular MTB or hybrid, but not massively so.  </p>

<p><strong>Warehousing margins</strong></p>

<p>Now, this is where the costs get interesting. The bike arrives at the wholesaler or distributor and gets put into a warehouse until a retailer orders it. The wholesaler has price tiers for their 'B2B' customers (the shops) and these will be different depending on sales volumes, e.g. the big chain will get an extra 10-20% off the 'trade price' compared to the family-run lower volume shop. Because the product has a list price then this discount is unlikely to be passed on to the end customer, however, it does give the volume retailer that bit more room come end-of-season sales.  </p>

<p>Notionally the wholesaler/importer/distributor is just importing boxes, putting them in a warehouse and sending them out again. In an ideal world they would charge just a flat fee for this, however, the more expensive boxes tie up more capital, they also tend to linger in the warehouse longer. This means they cannot be marked up by the wholesaler with a 'per box' price. Typically a standard margin is applied to the products, exactly what this margin is may seem high to someone outside of the trade, however, the tax man has a slice of that and some of that margin may be swallowed up by currency fluctuations.  </p>

<p><strong>Expensive, Niche Product</strong></p>

<p>When the retailer buys the electric from the company owning the big warehouse they may be buying just the one - most bicycle shops cannot afford the showroom space or the capital cost to have a range of electric bicycles. For this reason it is unlikely that a good deal is done due to bulk purchasing. The delivery to the bike shop may be relatively expensive too - delivery with all couriers in the UK is by weight. So we have double the cost on this leg of the journey when compared to the regular bike.  </p>

<p>The retailer has what seems a good bit of money to make on the electric bicycle. However, walk-in customers have not arrived for an electric bike, they are there for normal bikes. They may not even be aware that electric bikes are on offer too. Walk-ins just don't ask for an electric bike - customers wanting touring bikes or tandems are rare, customers wanting electric bikes are rarer too for the regular bicycle shop. To change this situation requires promotion, i.e. advertising, a window display and sales staff training. With the exception of retailers that have gone out of their way to push electric bike sales, this does not happen.  </p>

<p><strong>Training / Support</strong></p>

<p>As well as the sales staff having to be able to know how to sell an electric bike the mechanics in the back room have to know how to make them showroom ready. Then, should a sale come along, the bike has to be checked to make it safe. Additionally, the bike will collect quite a bit of dust waiting for a customer and be subjected to test rides by potential customers. This total time will be a lot more than with the regular bike because the electric bike is not so familiar to the workshop team. It is unlikely that this time is costed, however, it all adds up. Hence the eventual sale is unlikely to be discounted (unless the shop is small and desperate for some extra cashflow that week or the model is end of season and needs to be shifted). The taxman also takes his cut, 20% VAT is not a lot of money if buying a 'Bicycle Shaped Object' (cheap bike), but is a lot of money if buying an electric bicycle.  </p>

<p><strong>Margin Pricing</strong></p>

<p>If we work through the above steps starting with one small component, e.g. a washer that costs a penny. Its cost could be ten pence by the time it has been fitted onto the bike, maybe up to twenty pence to get to the warehouse in Milton Keynes. Because of how margin costing works, the washer could then cost forty pence by the time it gets to the showroom. On the face of it, it seems ludicrous that a penny washer now costs forty times as much, however, along the way nobody has been greedy (maybe with the exception of the taxman, but that is government protection rackets for you - lots of wars to pay for).  </p>

<p>Although the maths has been simplified with the 'washer' example, costs go up from component supplier to the cycle manufacturer to the distributor and to the dealer with the maths being multiplication (by a margin) rather than addition (of a handling fee) at most steps. That is how it works.  </p>

<p>Clearly, to save costs a cheaper washer could be used - one that costs the factory 0.5 pence - and it could be fitted to the bike by someone in mainland China costing less than the Taiwanese worker. The factory too could be cheaper - with less capital tied up in the building/land. This 'cheaper and nastier' product could then enter the supply chain to be marked up with margins at the importer-distributor-wholesaler-retailer steps. Given that the product is not really one that anyone really wants, some incentives exist in the supply chain, e.g. higher margin for the retailer. Hence the 'cheap' electric bike - as sold by certain High Street chains - might be a complete rip-off with the worst components and the fattest of profits for someone in the chain.    </p>

<p>You might suspect that parts and training would factor into the costs, but it does not do so directly. Sales and workshop staff in the bike shop are unlikely to have had any training on how to look after customers for electric bikes. The spare parts are not likely to be kept in the cycle shop - these will be special order from the wholesaler. The wholesaler will be able to sell these spares profitably and - if they know what they are doing - keep sufficient spare parts stocked appropriate for demand.  </p>

<p><strong>The price is Actually Reasonable</strong></p>

<p>We are a long way off monopoly pricing with electric (and normal) bicycles, due to competition in the marketplace the pricing is nearer 'cost + acceptable profit' rather than 'what the market will tolerate'. Electric bikes are not expensive per se. With the exception of walking (and maybe container freight) there is no cheaper transportation going. Arguably normal pedal cycling is more expensive than electric bike cycling, however, this depends on how you value your time. Electricity to charge and electric bike costs less than a Mars Bar (or other calorific food equivalent).  </p>

<p>In the showroom electric bikes are somewhat clunky feeling, but once you go on the road with them and put the motor on the bike feels as light as a feather, particularly up hills.  </p>

<p>My advice for getting an electric bike cheaply is to do so through government 'bike to work' scheme. This is where your employer buys the bike and gets the tax back. Effectively you get the bike at 50% retail price, with actual ownership of the bike being between you and your employer. Typically they let you have it.</p>

Looking at the <a href=""http://www.konaworld.com/09/09_drdew_en.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">2009 Dr. Dew</a>, it looks like the geometry is more aggressive due to a flat bar and a different stem.</p>

<p>How is the fit/posture affected by the difference in bars? Is it more taxing on the rider to maintain such a posture without increasing the weight on the hands?</p>

<p>Given that the basic frame geometry of the Dr. Dew is identical to my bike, can I replicate the setup simply by switching to a flat bar like <a href=""http://www.jensonusa.com/store/product/HB408A01-Fsa+Xc-180+Alloy+Flat+Bar.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this FSA XC-180</a>? Should I replace the stem and/or headset at the same time?</p>
","<p>Looks to me like the difference is as much in the stem as in the bar.  (It may be that for the Dr. Dew the bar has simply been rotated to a flatter position.)  And both bikes appear to use a threadless headset, so the stem can be replaced without touching the headset proper.  In some cases the stem is designed to allow it to be removed from the bar without having to ""strip"" the bar, in other cases not.  Can't tell from the pictures.</p>

<p>Minor differences in bar position -- height and ""reach"" -- can have a major effect on riding comfort.  Lowering the bar and/or moving it forward will significantly increase the pressure on the hands and add strain to the back.  It does improve aerodynamics significantly, but, unlike with a ""drop"" bar, you tend to be stuck with that lower position, even when you'd like to relax a bit.  (But there are various add-ons for straight bars that allow one to switch back and forth between a relatively upright position and a more aero one.)</p>

<p>(In fact, it's a pet peeve of mine that many bikes are designed to look ""mean"" on the showroom floor, with bar positioned low, but the bars are positioned too low for the comfort of most riders, and the threadless scheme makes it harder to raise the bar very much.  As a result, many bikes are purchased, ridden for a few weeks, found to be uncomfortable, and then forgotten.)</p>

<p>I was surprised the bike didn't come with much in the way of instructions about servicing the hub since it came with guides for most of the other components.</p>

<p>I went to one bike shop and they quoted £140 for the hub to get serviced, which seemed a bit excessive until I went and looked at how much the official Shimano servicing kit costs alone. </p>

<p>I want to service this myself as I think it'll be a good lesson to learn.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does anyone have any experience of advice for doing this? </li>
<li>What tools will I require?</li>
<li>What lubrication is recommended? </li>
<li>Are there any guides?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I've owned a Scott Sub 10 Alfine 8 (orange 2011) since Jan 2012. I've done 1600 miles and it runs very nicely indeed. Unfortunately I rode through a 'puddle' during the floods, which turned out to be 18"" deep - it completely submerged the hub for 5-10 seconds. I bought a litre of the magic shimano oil for £60 from a shop which has since gone bust. When I opened the hub there was absolutely no water ingress and the internals looked factory fresh. I followed Shimano's servicing instructions to the letter. It's not difficult, taking about 2 hrs - a professional mechanic could do the whole thing in 30 mins.
The quote of £140 is very steep. Although the oil retails for £80, it is reusable - just leave it to settle and return to the tin. I weighed the oil can before and after, and I used 35gm - in other words there's enough for 30 services. The cost to a shop which regularly services Alfines would be £3 per hub. Adding 1 hour's labour would come to about £30. If you do your own servicing, don't degrease the hub in solvent - the drive side bearings are inaccessable without buying an expensive tool, and thin oil, like ATF, will not keep them sweet for long. Read the net for loads of people who've done this and now blame Shimano. Regarding 8th gear: this has the most cable tension,so if it's an adjustment problem, it needs more tension. Also look out for a rusty/ bent cable. Finally, if there's dirt behind the casette joint it might limit movement.
Try removing the cassette joint, cleaning it and regreasing the cable while your at it. I'd be quite happy to talk you through the service, but I don't want to publish my email/phone. I'll keep an eye on this page incase you want to contact me again.</p>

","<p>As for sheer maneuverability, seat tube angle may in some (rather extreme) cases affect wheelbase, which affects stability at variety of speeds. Also seat tube angle will have some minor effect on the position of rider's centre of gravity making it slightly easier to descend with smaller seat tube angle... I guess it would be an unnoticeable difference though.</p>

<p>But main aim of angled seat tube is above all to make pedalling more correct in a biomechanical way, thus more efficient..... and making it possible for a rider to reach the ground while still being on the saddle, say when they're stopping. For the right distribution of stresses within your joints you need an angle adjusted to your body - people with longer thighs will need smaller angle. In general too low angle encourages lower cadence and more forceful pedalling which isn't very good for your joints. What's interesting is that it doesn't work the other way round - it's possible to ride relatively safely with very high angles - it's usually 78-80 degrees for TT bikes. (I meant to put an article titled ""Myth of K.O.P.S"" for Sheldon Brown website, but the link doesn't seem to work)</p>

<p>Here is the link to Sheldon's <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/kops.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Myth of K. O. P. S. (knee over pedal spindle)</a> article.</p>

<p>Seat tube angle can be quite well made up for with fore-aft saddle position, so 2 degrees in difference can be easily neutralised. And the differences in angles between sizes may come from various sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>it could be forced by the design, for example to avoid some weird top tube length or too short distance from the crank to front wheel.</li>
<li>it may also be a form of adjusting the geometry to body proportions of riders of different sizes.</li>
<li>or it could be done to lower the centre of gravity for a large rider, that for large sizes is pretty high anyway.</li>
</ul>

"How to measure calories burned?","7107","","<p>How can I accurately measure the calories burned while using my bicycle?  My bike computer tells me how many calories I have burned.  But it has no cadence meter. The only measurements it has are my weight, distance, instantenous speed, and time (and all information it can derive from that).  Using the GPS on my phone, and the software from <a href=""http://www.sports-tracker.com"">Sports Tracker</a> on the same route, I got wildly different results.  The information on sports tracker yielded about 1.5 times more calories burned then on my bike computer.  Now, the GPS has a little more information, like altitude, but the ride was mostly flat. To add to that, there was an elevation drop over the entire route, so I don't know why it would say I burned more calories.  Do these devices use standard formulas, or do they just make stuff up?</p>

<p>Is it even possible to accurately measure the calories burned?  It seems that even if I had a cadence meter, there would still be a lot of variables.  Wind speed would make a big difference.  If you pedal with the wind at your back on a fixed gear, going 30 km/h, you are going to use a lot less energy pedaling the same bike at the same speed if you are going into the wind.  Note that in both these cases your cadence would be the same, but your muscles would be working much harder in the case where you were working against the wind.   Same could be said for things like hills, although this could be done with altitude, although I'm not sure how accurate you could get. Road conditions could also make a big difference, not to even get into the riding characteristics of the bike.  </p>
","<p>Yes, it's possible to measure calories burned. To do so accurately you need some sort of power measurement device. </p>

<p>More accurate and more portable are the mechanical systems that attach to your bike - <a href=""http://www.cycleops.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">PowerTap</a> is one example. These measure torque and speed at some point and work out power from that, often with corrections for various factors (input vs output power being the most obvious).</p>

<p>Less accurate but possibly more useful to you for training are the systems that attempt to work out the  biological power input. They work by measuring the difference between inhaled and exhaled oxygen or carbon dioxide, and generally use terms like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max"" rel=""nofollow"">VO2 Max</a>. The apparatus for this is not even vaguely portable, so from those numbers they derive a relationship between your heart rate and your moving average power output (the response is not instantaneous), and on from there to your total energy output.</p>

<p>The cheap systems you see advertised will either measure bicycle speed and from that attempt to guess your power output, or measure your heart rate and guess likewise. Obviously the ""what sort of bike do you have"" and ""what sort of hreat rate response do you have"" questions are at best vague approximations to the truth and will vary over time. But the measurements are dramatically cheaper to make so they're consequently more popular.</p>

<p>A few years ago a friend looked at various mechanical systems and decided that PowerTab was the only system that was usefully accurate for him. We did break a couple of the cheap systems while trying to improve their accuracy, but that was acceptable because as sold they were useless to us. The VO2 systems are the definitive training aid because they tell you more than just average power output, and the other outputs are actually more useful than power output. Mechanical systems are the easy, every day measurement that gives you your overall progress, or for us, lets you evaluate the vehicle performance as well (to some extent we don't care whether you are five seconds faster at the same power output because the vehicle is more efficent, it fits you better or you have got stronger, we just care that the combination is more efficient).</p>

"Is it safe to Cycle with an Umbrella?","7039","","<p>Is it safe to cycle while holding an Umbrella? </p>

<p>Obviously it's at least a little less safe than biking without holding something in your left (or right) hand. But how much more dangerous is it? </p>

<p>Specifically, suppose that I'm biking on a flat-ish, smooth surface, on a day with almost no wind (say 5km/h), at moderate speeds (say 15km/h) and in enough rain that the umbrella is helpful.</p>

<p>I commute by bike every day, and have recently moved to a new location where the weather often produces these conditions, and where the folding bike and roads I ride on often lead to the above scenario. Recently I have begun riding with an umbrella in hand after observing several other riders doing so, and have fallen off thrice while learning, producing one minor injury to my toe. For comparison, I had one fall and no injuries while learning to use clipless pedals, and one other injury-free fall in the last 5 years. </p>

<p>What I really want to know is this: Assuming someone does this regularly (presumably like the other riders I see), is someone who rides in the conditions mentioned above 10% more likely to suffer a serious accident or 10 times more likely? In the former case, I view the enjoyment / safety tradeoff as being clearly in favor of the umbrella, in the latter I take the opposite view and will stop doing it. </p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to see a study on the subject, but since such a thing doesn't exist (AFAIK), guesswork or anecdotes will suffice.</p>
","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWuUS.jpg"" alt=""Cycling umbrella""></p>

","<ul>
<li>Being aware of your weight distribution can help a lot. You want to make sure you are not leaning forward and taking pressure off of the rear tire. </li>
<li>You can also help keep your rear tire planted by giving a slight downward twist on the handlebars with your wrists. Kind of the opposite of a bunny hop. </li>
<li>As far as braking technique goes, try to be ""progressive"" about it. Instead of just applying all the braking power at once, or applying a tiny bit of brakes and just waiting for the bike to run out of steam. Try squeezing the lever, and as you start to slow, apply more and more brakes. This will help you stop in a shorter distance without your losing traction. </li>
</ul>

<p>A note about skidding: Generally rear tire skids can be handled when they happen. A lot of times the best way to ride them out is to keep on the brake and slowly ease it back out. If you just let go of the brake immediately, the rear tire can snap back around and it is easy to lose control. Front tire skids are a little different. If your front tire starts to skid you <strong>do</strong> want to let go of the front brake immediately. Keeping your front tire rolling is very important to maintaining control of the bike.</p>

"What physically makes chainrings have a specific speed compatibility?","6910","","<p>Chainrings are sold as having a specific compatibility for only certain speed setups, some overlapping across many. What physically makes this the case?</p>

<p>From what I understand, 5/6/7/8/9 speed chains all have the same <em>internal</em> width, 3/32"", and the only difference is the <em>external</em> width of the chain. Does this also extend through 10/11 speeds as well, or do they have smaller internal widths which would necessitate skinnier chain rings as well? Or is it the case that the external width just keeps shrinking?</p>

<p>IF the difference is only the external width, then it would seem the only compatibility issues would not be in the chainrings themselves, but the spacing in between each one. If it was too small/too wide a chain, the chain would hit the next chainring, and if it was significantly too large the chain may fall in between rings. </p>

<p>However, it would seem that you could use the same rings with a wider chain (9 speed rings with a 5/6/7/8 speed chain) if you put appropriate spacers between the rings, such as <a href=""http://branfordbike.com/itemdetails.cfm?id=808"">these</a>. The opposite may be possible if you're willing to grid / mill the appropriate amount off the mounting pad.</p>

<p>What this would also imply is that with the right width spacers (and bolts that can accomodate them) you could always go <strong>down</strong> speeds with a given set of chainrings.</p>

<p>If that is not the case (say 11 speeds have a different internal width), then they might be too wide for the chain an you'd have to remove material near the teeth to make them fit inside the chain or conversely that you'd be wearing on less of the chain than you should so your chain wouldn't last as long.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some rings are marketed as 5/6/7/8 speed only, some 9 speed only, and some 5/6/7/8/9 compatible. Is this some sort of blending of the two specifications (the spacing being some compromise between true 8/9 speeds) or just that they're made for one but tested to work on the other (or just a marketing trick)?</p>
","<p>The internal width is obviously one important feature.  But for indexed shifting the ring has a pattern embossed on the side facing the smaller ring that catches the pins of the chain when shifting.  The combo of the embossing depth/pattern and the ring-to-ring spacing affects what width chain (and brand chain) will work best with the ring.</p>

<p>I've no idea what combos can be expected to work with what, though.  I lost track when they went to 8 speeds, and now it's a total free-for-all.</p>

"How do I fix movement in headset","6898","","<p>I have bought a second hand bike and generally it's going well. However, there is a small amount of play in the headset that I've been trying to diagnose and resolve.</p>

<p>It's a threadless fork.</p>

<p>I've adjusted the tension by loosening the headstem bolts and tightening the top cap. I tighten it up a lot and this reduces the play a little, but when I brake hard or hit a bump I still get the 'clonk' as it moves to the limit of it's adjustability.</p>

<p>I've used <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/headsets.html#overhaul"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article on Sheldon Brown</a> for the terminology I use below, particularly this photo:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2GOs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've taken some photos and have an idea of what the problem is. In this photo I've laid out from left to right the dust ring, followed by the compression ring.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wai3G.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When the compression ring is placed on the steerer tube, there is slight gap between them. It's maybe a millimeter, although I don't have anything to measure that with here. Watching the movement carefully I'm quite confident that it's this gap that's causing the steerer tube to clonk around.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uEmxD.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've measured the steerer and it's 28.6mm which is 1 1/8"" according to Sheldon's site linked above.</p>

<p>So why is there a space around the compression ring? What's the best way to resolve this? Do I just need to find a smaller compression ring somehow? Or is there something I'm missing?</p>

<p>Updated: Added text to photo</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I think I'm missing a part. If you look closely at the exploded graphic from Sheldon, the compression ring has a gap in it, allowing it to shrink onto the steerer tube and hold it firmly. My compression ring is solid, so nothing can shrink and grip. Kudos to Zen as well, since he mentions that it's a wedge. I'm going to have a look around at home to see if I can find the missing bits. Otherwise a new headset should sort it. Thanks all!</p>
","<p>The compression ring is a wedge.  There will always be space and movement here, until the headset is assembled and adjusted.</p>

<p>It looks like you're missing a part. There should be another hoop with a wedge shape and a split. It's the split ring on the upper left in the image below. This part is what grips the steerer tube tight and will eliminate the clonking you're experiencing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lmLbj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>If you are confident that all the parts are there, and assembled in the correct order, then you have 3 likely reasons for movement:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first is that there is damage to the bearing cartridges.  This can show as movement when adjusted correctly, although usually on a headset it will fail first by being rough or crunchy feeling.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, there may be movement between the frame and the headset cup, which can mean that the frame is in need of replacement.  This can't be fixed via adjustment.  There are ways to attempt a fix, but it is best looked at by a qualified mechanic, first.</p></li>
<li><p>Last, there may be no movement in the headset, but you could be feeling movement in the brakes, depending on how you are checking for movement.  Try checking for movement by standing the bike on the rear wheel, turning the handlebar all the way to the left or right, and checking for movement with your hand around the headset.  That way if it is in the headset, you will feel it directly.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that is helpful.</p>

"Rear tire has started rubbing frame at one spot","6852","","<p>Riding my bike within my suburban residential neighborhood, I felt a shock, like a snap although I don't think anything snapped, followed by a rubbing noise every few seconds. Pedaling and the brakes continued to work.</p>

<p>I pulled over and examined my bike, starting with the brakes, and discovered that the left side of the rear tire now rubs against the left chain stay at one spot, near the tube valve stem. The wheel/tire is perfectly centered everywhere else along its circumference, just not there.</p>

<p>I've had this bike for about a year (bought at Goodwill), and, aside from a break over the winter, I've been riding it at least once a week, and I can tell you that this didn't happen before.</p>

<p>I haven't done any hard riding recently; I've been taking it easy as I build back up from my winter break.</p>

<p>The tire is seated correctly on the rim, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>I didn't count the spokes off one by one, but looking at where they each meet the rim, they seem to all still be intact. There weren't any dangling off or obviously snapped away.</p>

<p>The bicycle is an old Univega hybrid bike with 700c Bontrager tires. I'm no expert, but I'd describe the tires as road tires, about an inch wide.</p>

<p>I'm stumped for what's caused it or how to fix it.</p>
","<p>Check the spokes - its likely one or more has broken (""I felt a shock, like a snap...."".). The ones to check are ones that got from the rim, where the rubbing is occurring, to the hub on the opposite side of the rubbing (in your case, the right side of the hub). If these have let go, there is nothing stopping the rim being pulled to the left. </p>

<p>It may be that these are loose, not broken, although it unlikely. If the spokes are not broken, you might be able to straighten the rim by tightening the right side spokes and if needed, loosening the left side ones. It's not too hard if the rim is not too far out of true, but needs patience for a novice. </p>

<p>If there is a broken spoke, or the rim is a long way off and cannot be ""tweaked"" it will be worth taking to your LBS to get them to look at it. As it's only a year old, spokes should not be breaking.</p>

"How can you recognize a department store bike?","6835","","<p>You can obviously avoid department store bikes by buying from reputable local bike shops, but how can you tell whether a used bike is a department store bike? Are there any telltale signs? I have a friend who is looking to buy a used bike, and I would like to tell him what to look out for.</p>
","<p>As per @Mikes Answer, but a bit more than fits into a comment.  </p>

<p>Only buy a bike with the brand/model of major components able to  be researched. </p>

<p>On a Mountain bike, shocks are a dead giveaway, and if rear suspension, look at the shock, although they sometimes don't have a model, the good ones always have a brand. From there, pictures will get you close enough. Also look at the geometry - if it looks like a light weight motorbike it's rubbish (Unless it's a top end down hill rig)....  keep in mind age makes a big difference here, so search teh internet for parts of similar ages.</p>

<p>Brakes - Disk brakes should have a brand/model than can be researched. Rim brakes usually have something, but it's always a bad sign if not. </p>

<p>Seat / Seat post - worth a look, not a bad sign if no brand. </p>

<p>Drive train components can be tricky, many shops put an expensive rear derailleur on an otherwise cheap bike (That is all many people look at). Look at the cranks, the front derailleur, the shifters etc. These will usually have model information somewhere.  Wheels and hubs - again look at the brand/model - most came out with labels. </p>

<p>One useful guide is overall weight - lighter bikes cost a lot more. BUT make sure you compare like for like. No point comparing a carbon frame to a steel frame and assuming the carbon is better because it's lighter.</p>

<p>For a novice stick to a brand/model that you can get the details off the internet. Look for a bike that has signs of light or no use. Everything should work smoothly and reliably. No groans, squeaks, clattering of any sort. The problem is any of these can be a sign of big money or a 2 minute tweak to fix and it takes expert eye to tell the difference. </p>

"Is it really necessary to physically cross (interlace) the spokes on traditional wheel lacing?","6807","","<p>Recently I had to replace a hub on the front wheel of my workhorse bike. That meant unlace it and lace it again. Since the hubs were identical, I used the same old spokes, same not-so-old rim and same lacing pattern (3-crossings).</p>

<p>However, I noticed (already noticed it many times) the contact point between spokes around the 3rd crossing (where they actually touch one another) was a bit stained (even being stainless steel spokes) and a tiny bit worn.</p>

<p>I know it is traditional to cross the spokes this way, and Sheldon Brown explicitly advises to BEND the spokes against one anoter (which I heartily recommend everybody to do, increases wheel durability very very much.)</p>

<p>BUT since there are so much fancy wheels and even alternative lacing patterns (radial lacing, for example) where the spokes go straight from hub to rim, I wonder if it is really necessary to interlace the spokes in the first place.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can number some hypothetical pros and cons of INTERLACING:</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provides an extra contact point for the spoke, reducing mobility and flexion, and improving lateral stability;</li>
<li>Reduces resonance noises;</li>
<li>Allows for fixation of spoke-cards ;o)</li>
</ul>

<p>CONS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Makes assembly a bit more difficult;</li>
<li>Creates a potential stress point due to friction and flexion;</li>
<li>Creates an initial bending around the contact point, which might allow for fatigue-inducing flexion around the spoke elbow;</li>
<li>Makes cleaning a lot more difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: due to the confusion that arose between crossing vs. radial (which wasn't what I meant) and different ways to lace the same crossing pattern (what I intend actually), I made a drawing (out of scale) showing the two possibilities. At left, the ""physically touching crossing"". Please note that in the frontal view (bottom left) the spokes are not actually twisted against one another like the view might induce to think, but are only flexing against one another).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7oF8w.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I am very prone to lace my next wheel without physical crossings, since there seems to be enough evidence it is not actually necessary. Some months later, I could be sure if that works or not. But even if it is not necessary, it might still be better.</p>

<p>So, have you any information/link/knowledge/experience about?</p>
","<p>Probably the best source for answering this is Jobst Brandt's <em>The Bicycle Wheel</em>, the definitive text on the wire-spoked wheel and an essential for anyone interested in the art of wheelbuilding.  Excerpted from page 68 of the 3rd edition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spokes in a crossed pattern are usually interlaced at their last crossing before reaching the rim. Spokes coming from between the flanges are laid over those from outside the flanges. Interlaced spokes take up each other's slack during severe radial loading and reduce the chance of spokes becoming loose. If spokes become loose, their nipples can unscrew. Radial spokes cannot be interlaced and therefore, lose alignment from road shock more easily. Interlacing also gives more clearance between the spokes and the derailleur on rear wheels.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generally speaking, do all MTB derailleurs have <em>some</em> road shifter with which they would be compatible? Or if you were planning on buying a MTB with the aim of switching to road shifters, would you need to be careful about your initial choice of MTB drivetrain? I.e. can you just buy whatever bike and build you like, then find the road shifter that will work with it? Or do you need to restrict yourself to a subset of MTB derailleurs for which you can actually get compatible road shifters?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the criteria for finding a road shifter that will work with a particular MTB derailleur?</p></li>

In the price range I'm looking in, I'm seeing that a lot of fat bikes are built with Sram 1x chainring and x5 or x7 rear derailleur. I would like to know if there is an integrated road shifter/brake lever that would be compatible with this rear derailleur (and also mech disk brakes, e.g. BB7).

<p>I am looking for three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>max speed on the road in short distance (when you spill out your lungs)</li>
<li>maneuverability in city traffic (going between cars)</li>
<li>and taking long trips on hard surfaces comfortably (and safely)</li>
</ul>

<p>How the <strong>frames</strong> of cross 700c bicycle and 29er affect those three factors? </p>

<p><em>I already noticed that since 700c have usually flat top tube of the frame falling from the saddle can hurt, 29er has more clearance -- so this a plus for 29er in terms of safety.</em></p>

<p>I don't consider downhill, going through mud, sand, big rocks, and on the other hand only smooth asphalt.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> example of cross 700c bike: <a href=""http://sklep-romet.pl/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=61&amp;product_id=64"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sklep-romet.pl/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=61&amp;product_id=64</a> and 29er as well: <a href=""http://sklep-romet.pl/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=59&amp;product_id=85&amp;size=MTB%2029ER"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sklep-romet.pl/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=59&amp;product_id=85&amp;size=MTB%2029ER</a></p>
","<p>Since both the bikes you link to are mountain bikes, you seem to be primarily concerned with wheel size or frame size. </p>

<p>But the two wheel sizes are the same = 700c is, more or less, a rim size, while 29"" is the outer diameter of the tyre (except that obviously you can get different width ""29er"" tyres and that affects outside diameter). That confusion is why tyres are now actually sold by ISO rim diameter - specifically the bead seat diameter. If you get that right the tyre will go onto the rim (it may not fit into your frame, or it may be far too fat for the narrow rim, but it will go on).</p>

<p>Frame size matters when you convert one of those to ride fast on sealed roads, you're going to need to do more than just switch the tyres. Most obviously, the 29er is generally lower than the cross frame so when you put the seat and handlebars up to get a better position for fast riding you may find that the 29er can't do that with the stem and seat post that come with it. So you'll probably have to buy a rising stem and possibly a head tube extender, and (less likely) a longer seatpost.</p>

<p>The gearing is also different, 48-11 top gear on the cross bike and 42-11 on the 29er. For both bikes you're probably going to want higher gears, but for the 29er the jump is going to be significant meaning you might need to change the front derailleur as well. I suggest allowing for a 50T or 53T large chainring, which on the cross bike is a small change and may not be worth while. It depends on how fast you ride and pedal.</p>

<p>Both frames are aluminium, just like most mid-range road bikes. I don't think that matters for what you're doing.</p>

<p>On that site the touring bikes (TREKKINGOWE?) would probably be an easier conversion to what you want, but I suspect you might prefer a cyclo-cross bike (drop bars, disk brakes, slightly heavier/stronger than a road bike).

"Clipless pedals: Why clipping in so darn difficult?","6765","","<p>I do understand that this question been asked million times, and million people have million different opinions and it's all down to personal preferences, yet I am struggling and need to find a solution that would work best for me.</p>

<p>So there's no question - clipless pedals are better. I knew that when I was buying my bike and now I have ""Look"" pedals, and of course I had to learn to unclip them safely without falling.</p>

<p>I can do that now, but clipping the cleat back into the pedal is my biggest pain. The pedal's back-side is heavier than its front, so it allways dangles upside-down and I have to keep kicking it with my toe, until it rotates back to its normal position. And even after that I usually struggle to get it clipped. And in the city it's a huge problem - sometimes, I have to roll without clipping it till a next red light. And very often that sucker ironically clips right before the light. Also the ""Look"" cleats are made of plastic and they definitely will deform over time, making it even harder to use.</p>

<p>Yesterday I even thought about installing a regular pedal for one foot, but then decided it's a bad, bad idea and I don't really want that.</p>

<p>Can you guys tell me if I should definitely try using SPD-SLs? Are they much better? Can someone who actually had experienced both systems (and maybe older SPD as well) can tell me that I would benefit from spending another hundred bucks and more? Or there's a way to train myself to clip without even having to look down and this is a newbie's problem and I will forget about it very soon, after maybe fifty thousand stops and after replacing forty pairs of cleats?</p>

<p>Also I noticed that I prefer to unclip my left foot and stand on it, so my left cleat is going to wear off faster. Are left and right cleats are the same? Can I just keep replacing one cleat (although I noticed they always sold in pairs)</p>

<p>And Look cleats are not compatible with SPD-SL, right? What about shoes? Would I need to buy another pair of shoes as well, if I decide to switch?</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong>: Switched to SPD. And I gotta tell you, it feels <strong>significantly</strong> better.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, I don't care that these XT 785s are meant for mountain bikes, </li>
<li>I don't care that they almost twice heavier than my KEOs, </li>
<li>I don't care that KEOs were almost twice the price i.e. maybe of
better quality.</li>
<li>I don't care that SPD is older technology than Look and SPD-SL</li>
</ul>

<p>After all, like Genghis Khan's adviser said once to his son: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is possible to conquer the world sitting in a saddle but impossible to rule the empire from it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said - riding a road bike is not always about speed, it's also about comfort. Maybe advocates of asymmetrical pedals would disagree, but I love my new pedals, they are awesome. Also I think now I understand why my previous pedals company called ""Look"" - you damn can't clip them in without looking straight at your foot</p>
","<p>This is part comment, part answer, but too long to fit in a comment, so here we go.</p>

<p>Personally, I use SPD, and when I ride with a group, everyone else has SPD-SL or LOOK.  I'm usually clipped in and across the intersection before they're clipped in.  Either I'm just really good at clipping in, or SPD are designed to be easier to get clipped in to. Even the very experienced riders tend to have problems with clipping in from time to time.  </p>

<p>Personally I don't know what advantage SPD-SL offers over SPD. People say that the larger platform allows for better power transfer, but I don't see how that makes difference. The foot pushes on the hard sole of the shoe, and sole of the shoe pushes on the pedal, which is made of rigid metal. Assuming there is no flex in the pedal or the sole of the shoe, it doesn't matter how large the attachment point is. </p>

<p>Personally, I would recommend you try out a pair of SPDs. Borrow some from a friend or see if the shop has a demo pair and see if that works better for you. Too many shops will push you towards road pedals (either SPD-SL or LOOK) because you're riding on the road, and you will break <a href=""http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#34"">""Rule 34""</a> if you use mountain pedals on a road bike. I think that SPD pedals are a much better solution unless you're an actual road racer and only plan to unclip at the end of the ride.</p>

"Can a guy wear a woman's helmet safely?","6750","","<p>I'm a guy and since I started wearing a helmet for mostly Trail Riding and occasionally for commuting, I noticed that the helmet looks really large on my head.

"Couch to Century","6699","","<p>Due to injury I've got to take a little time off from biking.  My physical therapist recommended doing a ""couch to marathon"" program when I'm feeling better to get me back into the swing of things.  But, being that I would rather ride a bike, are there any ""couch to century"" programs out there?  The reason my knee problem has persisted is because I get too excited when it feels a little better and I overdo the biking right out the gate resulting in re-injury.  So, I'd like something that takes me up to a century at a slow pace, maybe over a few months.</p>

<p>EDIT: In the spirit of less chatty answers, maybe a link to a specific training program would be nice.</p>
","<p>I'm going to answer this as a true couch to century with a general plan. You can write books on this stuff. There <em>have</em> been books written on this stuff.</p>

<p>You have three major goals for a successful century:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the raw fitness needed to keep the pedals going for 6+ hours.</li>
<li>Figure out how much you need to eat while going for the entire thing.</li>
<li>Do the above without getting any stress injuries.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Off the Couch</strong><br>
You are off the couch. You have a bike, old, new, mountain bike, road bike, it doesn't matter. If you've never ridden, get something cheap so you're not out much money if this isn't for you. You have at least one pair of cycling shorts, gloves and a helmet. The goals here are just to ride around. Don't go terribly hard, find some scenic routes, avoid steep hills if possible. Most importantly, work on pedalling smoothly. Nice circles with the feet. </p>

<p>Each week, try to get in three one hour rides.</p>

<p><strong>Building up</strong><br>
Make your way up to 4 rides per week. Three shorter ones and one longer one, maybe up to 2 hours. On your favourite loop, you'll see your average times slowly dropping. You are still not trying to ride really hard. When you get to the point that your weekly 2 hour ride isn't leaving you wasted for the day and the century still seems like a good idea, it's time for the next phase.</p>

<p><strong>Really Starting</strong><br>
Get a road or touring bike. Mountain bikes were fine up until this point, but unless your century is off road, you will want a real road bike. <strong><a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3549/bike-fitting-experiences"">Get fitted by a pro</a></strong>, this is possibly your single biggest injury prevention mechanism. Get <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/827/what-should-i-look-for-in-clipless-pedals-and-shoes"">clipless pedals</a>. Practice with them on the grass until you stop falling over.</p>

<p>The following sections can be repeated as needed. I did not get to 'month 3' for at least a year. Listen to your body.</p>

<p><strong>Month 1</strong><br>
If you commute by bike, everything other than the 'long' ride could be 2 shorter rides, always work on smooth pedalling. For the longer ride, bring a small snack and <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3532/how-much-to-eat-and-drink-during-a-50km-ride"">practice eating</a>.<br>
Week 1-2: 3x1 hour, 1x2 hours<br>
Week 3: 3x1 hour, 1x3 hours<br>
Week 4: 4x1 hour</p>

<p><strong>Month 2</strong><br>
Once per week, on the one hour ride, spend about 20 minutes in a flatter section riding harder. You want to hit a pace that's uncomfortable, but when 20 minutes is up, you can keep riding. You're not killing yourself here. You should be breathing hard, but if you really had to, you could go at that pace for an hour or more. This will take practice.</p>

<p>The longer rides now provide the constant threat of bonking. Try out gels, sports drinks, bananas, cold roasted potatoes and see what is palatable for you on the ride. Most organized  centuries have food stops, so you need to know before you do it if the food they are going to provide will agree with you. Aim for ~300 calories per hour, but listen to your body.</p>

<p>Week 1-2: 3x1 hour, 1x3 hours<br>
Week 3: 3x1 hour, 1x4 hours<br>
Week 4: 4x1 hour</p>

<p><strong>Month 3</strong><br>
Once per week on a one hour ride, do 2 of those 20 minute efforts with a 10 minute gap in the middle. Again, you're not killing yourself on these. It's uncomfortable, your legs are telling you that it would be nice to slow down a bit, but you can tell them to shut up. Put one or two similar sections into the longer rides.</p>

<p>Week 1-2: 3x1 hour, 1x4 hours<br>
Week 3: 3x1 hour, 1x5 hours<br>
Week 4: 4x1 hour</p>

<p><strong>Century</strong><br>
Once you are capable of a 5 hour ride, assuming that's not already century distance at your speed, you will effectively be capable of riding for 100 miles. It's just a matter of continuing to eat, drink and keep the pedals going. </p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>
Listen to your knees and joints. You will get more supple on the bike and you may need to get fitted again several months in. Fortunately, after that, you shouldn't change much.</p>

"How much motor do I need for my electric-assist bike?","6682","","<p><strong>I take my twins to preschool by car, and I'd like to switch to doing it by bike.</strong> </p>

<p>There's a hill, and we're heavy, and I'm not in great shape, so it's hard. I've done it a few times, but I always collapse when I get home, and I certainly don't have the energy to do it twice (drop-off + pick-up). I take a while to recover. It takes a lot longer, too.</p>

<p>I also would like to always bike to the grocery store and other errands, but they are within the range of the preschool, so let's focus on that one for now.</p>

<p>I'm looking at <strong>electric-assist bikes</strong> as a way to overcome the hurdle and starting doing this trip by bike (almost) every time. I've seen bolt-on hub-motor systems for as little as $300, and Big Dummy + Stoke Monkey setups for $3000+.  </p>

<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>

<p>The bike + trailer + me + passengers weigh <strong>430 lbs</strong>. There's a 230' climb on the way there, and 110' climb on the way back. I can drive it in <strong>4 minutes</strong> but biking takes <strong>20 minutes</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>How much motor (and how much battery) do I need to invest in?</strong></p>
","<p>A highly trained competitive cyclist can ride at ~ 350-400 watts of power output for a 2 hour ride.  So adding a 400 watt electric assist motor is roughly equivalent to adding a competitive cyclist 'stoker' to your rig.  The speed and battery size make a big difference but here are some rules of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some motors are measured in horsepower, rather than watts.  1/2 horsepower is roughly equal to 400 watts for this use.</p></li>
<li><p>A 400-watt motor will usually be sufficient for the average rider. Your rig is a little heavier, so you might want to go with higher watts.</p></li>
<li><p>On a typical 400 watt rig, two 12-volt, 12 amp-hour batteries will take an average rider 10 miles at 15 mph or up a hill that's 800 feet tall.</p></li>
<li><p>To go faster (assuming you haven't maxed out the watts) or further, you need to increase the battery - range is proportional, so twice the battery size = twice the range at the same speed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are companies like <a href=""http://www.econvergence.net/emb.htm"">Convergence Tech</a> that sell kits for motors in the 1 horsepower range that are pretty easy to add to an existing bike if you are mechanically inclined.  That range is probably more than sufficient for your needs.</p>

<p>Be aware that some areas limit the top speed or the available power for electric or gas-assisted bicycles.  I've seen speed limits of 25-30 mph and power limits as low as 500 watts.  You will want to check with your local road or transportation department to make sure you comply with local regulations.</p>

<p>I want to swap out the forks for some rigid forks.</p>

<p>Please tell me what specs I should be looking at to get the right fit.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I have recently just done the same thing and switched from suspension to rigid forks, although with a much older bike. There are a few things that you need to know.</p>

<p>The first is your type of headset, it will either be threaded or threadless. If you have a stem that clamps on the steerer tube and then your handle bars clamp onto the stem, you have a threadless headset. I can tell by the picture you have linked too that you do have a threadless headset. </p>

<p>The second thing you need is the diameter of you headset, which is generally 1 1/8 inches for modern mountain bikes but if you can find a specs sheet for your headset it will specify. If you cant find the info for your headset, just measure the steerer tube with a set of calipers and look at this page (<a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/cribsheet-headsets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheldonbrown.com/cribsheet-headsets.html</a>) under ""Threadless Headset / Steerers"" and reference the measured dimension to identify the size of steerer tube. </p>

<p>Last, and probably most importantly, you will need to know the axle to crown measurement. This is basically the measurement from the middle of your front axle to the top of your forks. There is plenty of info on the internet on how to take this measurement but the important thing is sit on the bike and get someone else to measure or get a friend of similar size to sit on the bike while you do it, this will ensure the slack is taken out of the suspension. This measurement will help you to get forks that are a suitable replacement length for your current ones. This is important because your frame has been engineered to work with forks of a given length and altering that geometry by a significant amount will alter the handling characteristics of your bike.</p>

<p>One thing that can help make it easier to select forks is to buy models that have been specifically made as replacements for suspension forks with a given amount of travel. If you know the amount of travel of your current suspension you can buy some forks that are specifically made to compensate for that amount of travel (i.e surly instigator 1.0 forks are made to replace shocks with 100mm of travel). It is still worth checking that the axle to crown measurement is similar to your current setup as they can vary in size by manufacturer. For example my original forks (2002 Rock Shocks Judy C) originally only had 80mm of travel but they are relatively long and I needed the Surly instigators to get the correct length. (They work awesomely well, by the way).</p>

<p>When picking new forks also make sure that they have the correct brake mounting fixtures. You will often need to specify for disc, or cantilever, or both. When you get the forks, it is probably easiest to take them to your LBS and get them fitted as they will need to take the fork crown race off your current forks and move them onto the new ones. This is best done with specialist tools, you can do it yourself, but it is not worth risking the damage to components as the crown race is specific to your headset and you may be up for a new headset if you damage it.</p>

<p>Also make sure the new forks are made for your size of wheels, 26, 27.5 29 etc.</p>

"How to protect myself when falling off the bicycle","6648","","<p>Today was rainy in Palo Alto and I was driving home in bike lane. My bike slipped and I felt off my bike in a part of bike lane that was made of concrete instead of asphalt(<a href=""https://maps.google.com/?ll=37.441128,-122.16028&amp;spn=0.003007,0.005659&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.441128,-122.16028&amp;panoid=HKEnhAKOlXpTUGQkz4FOvQ&amp;cbp=12,250.55,,0,0"">here</a>). I didn't injured and I am fine.</p>

<p>When I was falling down I didn't know how to shape my body to protect myself and prevent serious injuries. What should I do in situations like this?</p>
","<p>I'm going to assume you're a bright Stanford kid, and that your brain <em>will</em> remember this.</p>

<p>Work = F * d</p>

<p>Work = Force * distance</p>

<p>Try punching your arch nemesis for an instant. Just hit him for a second and as soon as you touch him, pull your hand back. Nothing happens.</p>

<p>Now when you punch, punch behind him. Keep pushing, all the way through, pushing pushing pushing. Whoa. Can you believe your own strength? That guy just flew across the room. You can try this with a punching bag, too. Whatever you like.</p>

<p>So when you punched your grandma or whoever, you had a lot of force but you didn't keep applying it over a distance. When you push push push then you do a lot of work to your poor grandma.</p>

<p>So basically the ground/fire-hydrant/tree is going to do a lot of work to you. That amount of work isn't changing, no matter what.</p>

<p>So you've got</p>

<p><strong>WORK</strong> = force * distance</p>

<p>Notice how work is bold here. Imagine work is written 10 feet tall on a chalkboard to represent how big work is here.</p>

<p>Now if your distance is small, the force is going to need to be... (guess)</p>

<p>very big.</p>

<p><strong>WORK</strong> = <strong>FORCE</strong> * dist</p>

<p>Now if you can find a way to extend your distance.... the force you experience will shrink.</p>

<p>So if you can extend your legs, extend your hands, do a parkour/Ta Kwon Do roll, something, that will dampen your fall.</p>

<p>Another example. Someone hits a baseball super deep into back field. You're playing without a baseball mit. Say you just hold your hand steady and catch it all at once. SMACK. That really hurts your hand. Now say you extend your hand all the way out, and as the ball lands in your hand, your arm moves back until your hand is at your chest, absorbing the blow. Ahhhh. No sweat!</p>

<p>Work=Force*distance</p>

<p>work is going to be same-same</p>

<p>Force needs to be small</p>

<p>so make distance big</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>The guys comments make a very good point. A lot of people get injured by extending their limbs. What's happening is they don't give their limbs room to bend. They brace for the fall by extending their arms/legs too far out, to protect their body/head. Instead they get locked. OUCH. Extend your arms/legs, but don't lock them forward. That's just going to make the distance very small again, and it's really going to hurt your joints.</p>

<p>So extend, but don't lock your elbows/knees.</p>

<p>Good point guys.</p>

<p>Think of it like falling. Don't lock your legs all the way forward. That's... really going to hurt. But if you extend the toes of your foot, bend your knees a little, and give that ground a good SLAP with your hands when you're landing, that fall is going to feel like butter. You can practice absorbing falls on a set of stairs. Go up one step, jump off, extend your feet/legs, and practice absorbing the whole fall. Then go up another step. Keep working at it until you can run off the top of the stairs and land on the bottom (if you're intense like that). You'll notice that the difference between the 10th step and the 11th step is HUGE. And the difference between the 11th step and the 12th step is INSANE. But that's another physics lesson.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Clarification</h2>

<p>The physics does not apply exclusively to spherical bodies. If you can extend your slide to 35 feet instead of 30 feet, you will SIGNIFICANTLY decrease the trauma you experience.</p>

<p>""<em>Kinetic</em>"" energy = moving energy = (mass * velocity^2)/2</p>

<p>velocity = distance/time</p>

<p>That means with any change in velocity will SQUARE the energy.</p>

<p>When you talk about <strong>collisions</strong>, you're talking about momentum. Specifically the <strong>change</strong> in momentum (""impulse of momentum"") or change in  mass * velocity</p>

<p>mass * velocity = Momentum</p>

<p>Mass is staying same-same.</p>

<p>Velocity is changing from 20MPH to 0.</p>

<p>That's a huge CHANGE in momentum.</p>

<p>If you increase the distance of that change in speed 5 ft (16% of 30ft), you decrease the change in momentum.</p>

<p>So remember to find a way to roll if it's safe. Don't add more energy to the impact by rolling into the collision, unless you're going to get substantially more distance. For example, if you're falling and you know how to land on your feet and instead of SLAPPing the ground, you roll forward over your shoulder, that's going to be even better. It takes a little training to learn how to forward roll like that, and I'm assuming that the best way to think of this is simply. I like my models to be simpler than the actual thing I'm describing.</p>

<p>So just think: how can I increase the distance of this collision? I don't want to BOOM hit the pavement all at once. I want to soften the blow by sliding more, absorbing some of the impact, whatever.</p>

<p>I'm not a medical doctor and I don't know very much anatomy. Something tells me we evolved to protect our heads and bodies for a reason. That's where all the really important organ stuff is. The problem with people who crash a lot, like skateboarders, is they tend to fuck up their limbs before they become experts at falling. Just don't lock your elbows/knees by over extending them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second, and probably most important advice: try to brake before the accident. Changing the speed before your collision will reduce the energy SQUARED. Again, try jumping off your stairs. Falling from 13ft is way way harder than falling from 10ft. That's because the little extra speed you have when landing gets squared as kinetic energy. Think of energy as the potential to do work. Like the floor having the potential to work your body into jello.</li>
<li>Wow, telling people to brake is probably the first advice I should have given.</li>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDfxL.jpg"" alt=""alt text""> </p>
","<p>Most of of trailer-bikes are pretty similar:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One speed. An inexperienced child will struggle to keep up when you pick up speed. She will also not be able to help much on the steep climbs.</p></li>
<li><p>No brakes. Your hands do a lot of work, and your stopping distance is longer.</p></li>

<li><p>Attaches to tractor-bike's seat post. When you turn left, the trailer will lean right.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexy. As your kid gets heavier, this can make slowly climbing a steep hill really hard. You can't go straight.</p></li>

<p>I found that it was really good for teaching my son how to pedal, and build the appropriate muscles, so he was at an advantage on his own bike. </p>

<p>The flex was not an issue when we started, but a couple years later I had to retire the trailer. I couldn't track a straight line up a hill. </p>

<p>Some models have 5 speeds. That's more complexity, but if it breaks you can still get home. It can help a kid learn about shifting. </p>

<p>The Burley Piccolo attaches to a special rack, making it lean properly in turns and supposedly reducing flex.</p>

<p>I am planning to buy it for casual use (not for high speed). I would probably go ride in evenings for about 25 miles. Can somebody please suggest the differences in first two categories?</p>
","<p>There are many causes for price difference in bikes. There are others reasons than these listed below, but they tend to fall in line with one of these four categories.</p>

<p><strong>Brand</strong></p>

<p>Branding is always a premium. As in every industry I can think of, some brands have a reputation that to some extent justifies a premium price. This reputation is based off a multitude of sub factors, such as warranties, customer care, recognized build quality, athlete association and such. Top brands such as Trek, Giant, Bianchi, etc. have built up a reputation over the years of their existence that people deem worthy of a premium price.</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>Materials used in the frame (and also components, but more on that later) affect the characteristics of the bike, but due to the nature of high-tech processes, these come at a price. For instance, high-modulus carbon fiber performs better than cheaper carbon types. The pricier stuff is lighter, stiffer, stronger, more durable or some combination of the above. Likewise, carbon has superior performance properties compared to aluminium or lower still, steel. Within the scope of any one material (carbon, aluminium or steel) there are many sub-classes that will perform better or worse - and have a price to match. The two bikes listed exemplify this point - both are made from aluminium, but the more expensive bike is made from a higher grade (7005 as opposed to 6061). The more expensive option also has a carbon fork - an expensive but potentially worthwhile investment.</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong></p>

<p>Bikes most commonly come as complete units, with only super high-end models available as frame only builds. This means your money is covering all the components on the bike as well as the frame. Components make a big difference to the bike's performance, from weight or strength to durability or aesthetics. The componentry of your bike directly influences the way you use it. For instance, clipless pedals (such as Shimano's SPD system) determine the way you pedal. The bike listed have some important differences in componentry:</p>

<p>The cheaper of the two has gear shifters separate to the brake levers. This is common on cheap road bikes, but in my opinion is incredibly annoying. Purists may argue that old bikes were made this way, but honestly, I find them almost dangerous due to the necessity for hand position changes every time you go to change gear or brake. Perhaps just a personal opinion, but worth considering.</p>

<p>The other big component difference is the gruppo - the drive-train, gears, etc. On the dearer model we have a FSA Omega compact BB30 Crankset. While not the top of the line, I would assume that this particular set would be more reliable or better built that the otherwise unnamed model from the cheaper option.</p>

<p>Finally, before we get bored of details, the wheels are an important component to consider. More expensive options are sometimes made from carbon, but stepping down from the elite we still see performance features such as flattened spokes or radial spoke arrangements. The Equation R's on the Diamondback have radial spoke lacing, but the Vilano does not. </p>

<p><strong>Customization</strong></p>

<p>In the realms of the super elite, performance gains become harder to achieve, and the associated cost increases drastically. There appears to be some sort of law of diminishing returns at play - the price difference between a 20kg bike and a 19kg one may be $200, while it could well cost you $2000 to save a couple of grams of paint (not kidding - check out Trek's Project One customization site, specifically the 5gm Vapor Coat Paint. That's pricey!). Essentially, we reach a point in the spectrum of bikes that performance is so good, that other factors such as custom paint or gram savings through carbon brake levers and spacers become the only avenues for improvement. This uber-rich world of cycling is almost exclusively for the professionals and hence self-funds through sponsorships and such, but it is available for anyone lucky enough to have deep pockets and exorbitant taste!</p>

<p>So those are the main reasons for the price discrepancy. Hopefully that should educate your purchasing decision! Good luck!</p>

"How to indicate you are going straight?","6603","","<p>I live in a country where people drives on the right.</p>

<p>Say I am riding my bike like this:</p>

<pre><code>    - main road

    vvvv      - narrow path
    vvvv      vv

<p>That is, I am going straight and want to continue like this in an intersection. For some reasons, people typically turn to the left in the crossroads (it is the main road), but I do want to go straight (a narrower path).</p>

<p>This means that pedestrians typically cross on point <code>(P)</code> without paying much attention to cyclists, despite us having preference. They check the road, though.</p>

<p>If I would go to the left I would indicate it with my arm. However, is there any way to indicate that I am going straight? I think on putting my hand straight but I am not confident that this will be understood by my fellow cyclists or pedestrians.</p>
","<p>It's difficult to say without seeing photos of the road layout.  However, if the road itself continues round to the left, you should indicate right when you're leaving it.</p>

<p>In general, you should think about the topology of the road, rather than its geometry.  It doesn't matter that you're following a geometrically straight line; you're still leaving the road for a separate carriageway, and you need to signal this intention.</p>

<p>The default assumption for someone crossing the road is that you'll continue along the carriageway you're already on.</p>

<p>This said, of course, common sense should always prevail!  Never do anything that feels dangerous (for you or for someone else).</p>

"Cannondale Lefty DLR Ti Fork Rebuild/Maintenance","6600","","<p>I have a mountain bike with a 2003 Cannondale Lefty DLR Ti fork. As I've been riding the bike this season, I've noticed that the fork is behaving strangely. It doesn't seem to lockout fully and it is a lot ""squishier"" than it used to be. Also, when it decompresses after a hard compression, I notice a strange noise -- it's hard to describe but it sounds almost like gurgling fluid. I've already tried adding air to the fork using a shock pump (the pressure was very low) and that did make it a little less ""squishy"" but it's still not working like it used to.</p>

<p>It seems to me that it's time to do some serious maintenance on the fork; possibly even a full rebuild. How complicated should I expect this repair to be? What specific skills and tools will I need? What is the procedure for doing a rebuild?</p>

<p>I would like to evaluate the level of difficulty of this repair so that I can decide if it is something I'd be comfortable doing myself.</p>
","<p>First thing you should do is read the tech sheet on your fork. I believe the link below is the correct one.

"How can I stop my mudguards from rattling?","6564","","<p>Is there a simple way to stop the mudguards on my bike rattling? They're securely connected, but when I go over bumps in the road they tend to wobble about and rattle against my front wheel.</p>
","<p>I think it's a problem that must be solved on a one-off basis, since there so many different fender/bike combinations.</p>

<p>First make sure the connections are really tight.  Often they work loose over time.  Then try to observe what's rattling.  Some heavy tape applied to points that tend to knock against the bike frame may help.  Different fenders that are stiffer and have more stays is another possibility.  In some cases you may simply want to cut off, eg, part of the front fender extending forward from the fork, as that area tends to be less well secured and vibrates quite a bit.  (Mine cracked at the fork and the front part fell off some years back, and I haven't missed it.)</p>

"Can I replace only the smallest cog on my rear cassette?","6544","","<p>I currently have a 12-30t rear cassette which needs replacing.   While I'm at it, I really want to switch to an 11 tooth to get the extra 9% in top speed.  But the problem is, even the most expensive (e.g. Ultegra) component that will work with my bike only goes up to 11-28, and if I stick to Tiagra I'm stuck with 11-25.  For long steep hills on an off day, it's really nice to have the 30 tooth.</p>

<p>So my second thought was, the bottom 2 or 3 cogs usually aren't fixed to the cassette, they are individual cogs that can come off.  So maybe I could get a 12-30 replacement, and then a single 11t cog to replace the 12t or maybe I could even drop the 13t so the stepping goes 11-12-14.  This would be ideal as I use the 12t and 14t heavily but I virtually never use the 13t.</p>

<p>Would this work?</p>

<p>From what I can see, I would also need an 11t lock ring.  I'm having a difficult time finding both a lock ring and an 11t cog which claims to be compatible.  For instance, I found one cog which claimed to only work various cassettes which were already 11-xx and which were 2-3 grades above my Tiagra components.</p>

<p>Update: I found <a href=""http://si.shimano.com/php/download.php?file=pdf/ev/EV-CS-4600-3143.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this PDF file on the Tiagra CS-4600</a> which suggests I need part Y1YF01000 (""Lock Ring for 11T Top Gear""), and Y1Z81100N (""Sprocket Wheel 11T (Built in spacer type)"").  But I can't find anywhere (for instance Amazon or Google Shopping) to buy these part numbers or the corresponding parts.</p>
","<p>You can replace the smallest cogs on cassette.<br>
For example see Sheldon Brown's <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/k7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Building custom cassette</a> page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, Shimano doesn't make any true ""corncob"" (one-tooth-jump)
  cassettes for time-trialists or flatland riders. In 7 speed, the
  closest is the J (13/14/15/16/17/19/21).</p>
  
  <p>If you remove the 21-tooth sprocket from a J, you can make it into a
  13-19 corncob by buying an 18 to put between the 17 and the 19.
  Alternately, you could make it into a 12-18 by removing the 19 and the
  21, and adding a 12 and an 18.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also about MTB &amp; Road compatibility:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Road"" vs ""Mountain"" Hubs There is no interchangeability issue between
  ""Road"" vs ""Mountain"" cassettes and hubs as long as the number of
  sprockets matches. Although ""Road"" and ""Mountain"" hubs are no
  different as far as cassette fitting is concerned, they are different
  in terms of overall spacing. ""Road"" hubs generally use 130 mm spacing,
  while ""mountain"" hubs are 135 mm.</p>
  
  <p>""Mountain"" hubs will likely be slightly better sealed against dirt and
  mud than ""road"" hubs, but this is rarely an issue in practice. The
  wider 135 mm spacing will generally result in a slightly stronger
  wheel due to reduced dishing of the spokes.</p>

"How often should I change brake cables and housing?","6539","","<p>Seems like every year towards the end of cyclocross racing my brake cables start to get 'sticky'. The STI shifter is fine for changing gears, but when pulling on brakes it feels like I'm breaking loose something stuck before the pads actually touch the rims. I think water/mud/grime is somehow working into the housing and adding friction.</p>

<p>I have replaced the cables and housing about this time every year. Is this too often? Should I be doing some better (more) maintenance? - I rinse and wipe bike clean after every race and practice, but not really anything special for brake cable/housing.</p>

<p>side question: Should I change shifting cables and handlebar tape at the same time (since I'll have the wrap half way off)?</p>
","<p>I encourage replacing once there is a noticeable decline in performance (usually that means that they get ""sticky"").</p>

<p>Depending on the type of elements you go through, you might get back most of the perf by pulling the cable most of the way out, adding a drop of <em>thin</em> oil, then sliding the cable back through all the housing. Repeat a couple of times wiping cable each time. This will often clear the bits of gunk that are making it sticky.</p>

<p>Changing shift cables/tape at same time:
Tape...absolutely, it's cheap and I always feel like I've treated my bike nice when it's sporting new wrap.</p>

<p>Shift cables...if they are in good shape and the drive train is clicking along nicely, I tend not to mess with it. If they are getting sluggish like the breaks, then I'd go ahead. Keep in mind on the shift cables that they will stretch a bit so you will need to tighten the cable and possibly do a slight retune of the drive train a bit after a few days.</p>

"Tire Gauge to Avoid Over-Inflation","6513","","<p>I just purchased a tire floor pump with a gauge for my bike. The gauge seems to start off at 0 PSI when I connect the pump to the tire.

Not sure if that's correct or if I'm doing something wrong.</p>
","<p>The pressure dial doesn't measure the pressure in the tube - it gives the pressure in the entire system (tube + hose).  When you connect your pump, you need to pressurize the hose to the same level as the tube before it will read anything.  I usually find this takes two or three full pumps, and the resistance jumps up massively once the tube and tire have the same pressure. At that point, the dial will show you the pressure in your tire.</p>

<p>Now, I just got my first road bike, and I can't seem to get the angle to feel right. The seatpost is an Icon Graphite series (single bolt adjustment, but has notches as you angle the seat fore and aft). Saddle is a Selle San Marco (Trek 'postal service' design).</p>

<p>It seems that at one seat angle, it feels fine when I have my hands on top of the bars (on brake handles), but when I'm in the drops, its not so comfortable on my ""soft bits"", and I find myself lifting myself slightly off the seat with my legs as I ride to keep the pressure off.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if I tip the seat 1 notch forward, then I feel more comfortable in the drops, but when more upright on top of the bars or on the brake handles, then my butt slides forward.</p>

<p>I guess this just has to do with the change in body angle from being on top of the bars to being in the drops, and wanting the seat to be at a different angle for each position.  Since on my mountain bikes, you don't really change your whole body's angle that much, I've never had this problem before.</p>

<p>I though maybe switching to a 2-bolt style post might help because I could try to get it adjusted into a ""sweet spot"" basically at an angle between 2 notches on this Icon post, but the Icon post is also set back slightly, whereas a 2-bolt adjustable design puts the seat directly over the tube, so the seat would be slightly more forward then to begin with...</p>

"How Strong is my road bike?","6466","","<p><strong>Background:</strong> I have spent most of my time riding mountain bikes but I have recently started riding road sometimes too.  I really like the position the road bike puts you in and the fact that you have multiple different hand positions.  So I want to start riding my road bike more.  </p>

<p>I have a retro steel Norco road bike.  (Although I am interested in answers regarding aluminum road bikes too). </p>

<p><strong>I am curious how much I need to baby my road bike.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Can I drop off curbs on my road bike?</li>
<li>What about logging roads and trails are they fair game?  Can I do some drops?  </li>
<li>When I add a rack to my road bike how much gear can I put on it before I do damage to the bike?  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am not interested in whether it is a good idea to ride a road bike down a muddy bumpy trail.  What I am asking is will I hurt my bike?  Even though my bike was second hand and cost me less than $100 I have a strong relationship with it.  </p>

<p><strong>Recognizing Problems:</strong> I know that I may damage my wheels doing more agressive riding.  It is pretty easy to eye-ball wheels to see if they are ridable.  Is this true for the frame as well?  If I do structural damage to the frame would it be obvious?  </p>

<p><strong>Cross:</strong> I think that cyclocross bikes are designed for the kind of riding that I am describing.  Is there any difference between my retro road bike and a cyclocross bike?  </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How cautious do I need to be to avoid damaging my road bike?  </p>
","<p>Good question - I went down the same path (MTB -> road bike) and was worried about having to be super gentle. But actually, a road bike is surprisingly strong provided forces are applied in the right direction. Riding off curbs or over bumpy surfaces shouldn't cause a problem, but I wouldn't suggest doing drops. Similarily provided your bike isn't a super lightweight frame (and it sounds like it isn't) fitting a rack will probably be okay (especially if the frame has mounts for them). </p>

<p>A lot of the pros on the Tour de France used their standard road bikes on the cobbled stages just with special tyres, and those stages were very bumpy. And the teams that used dedicated Paris-Roubaix style bikes mainly did so for comfort and speed, not strength.</p>

<p>It's when you start applying forces to the bikes in ways that weren't intended that you are likely to damage it - i.e. riding into things, jumps or crashing. That's where the extra durability of a mountain bike comes in. It also depends on your weight - without being rude, if you're a big rider simple physics means you are going to stress the bike more.</p>

<p>If you do do damage it may not be easy to see. Especially small cracks may be very had to spot, although if they get big they will be pretty obvious. I certainly wouldn't recommend assuming that just because you can't see problems there aren't any there - you really don't want your fork to fail at the crown which could cause a very serious accident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to ride your road bike off road a significant amount you might be better off with a cyclo cross bike. It will be a little bit heavier but stronger and more capable of dealing with crashes, but more importantly it will enable you to fit much wider tyres, and gives much better mud clearance. Many cyclocross bikes have rack mounts on them as well, and the geometry is tweaked to make them more comfortable to ride off road.</p>

<p>It's just my experience but as a mountain biker, I feel much more comfortable riding a cyclo cross bike - either on or off road - than I do a dedicated road bike, probably because the handling is better (for me).</p>

"Bent Handlebars","6462","","<p>My girlfriend recently got a new road bike.  After getting it home we realized that that handlebars were quite badly bent.  Here is a picture.  </p>

<p>Here is my question.  Can I try and bend the bars back into shape or should I go out and get her a new pair?  </p>

<p>I suspect whether I can bend them back into shape will depend on what they are made out of.  How can I tell this?  The frame is made out of butted chromoly (according to a sticker on the bike).  </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Is this a warning flag about other issues on the bike?  I have checked the frame over (specifically where the head tube and top tube) meet to look for crash damage but I did not find anything.  Overall the frame looks good to my eyes.  Should this worry me?  What would cause bars to bend like this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzhiA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The bars <em>could</em> have been bent that way courtesy of a vehicle reversing into the bike. This would apply the required force without causing damage to the other parts. Alternatively, the bike could have been crashed for the STI levers and tape to somehow get off lightly.  </p>

<p>Bending them back into shape is definitely a consideration. You need to apply an equal an opposite force to what they once received, however, in reality you will struggle to bend them back 'exactly right'.  </p>

<p>If this was my own bike then I would put the bars in the vice and pull them back - taking care to put something soft in the vice to not have 'teeth marks' on the bar tape. I wouldn't even bother taking the bars out of the stem, in that way the bike can be used for leverage. I would spend no more than ten minutes giving it a go, and I would hope to get lucky.  </p>

<p>If I did not have a vice (or the 'fix' did not work) then I would use a big wooden stick to apply the necessary leverage. If that did not work out then I would just get new bars and tape.  </p>

<p>Steel handlebars are hard to find, given the ch-mo frame I doubt the bars are carbon fibre rather than steel.  </p>

<p>There is this thing called 'metal fatigue' that limits how far and how often you can bend aluminium before it breaks. There is also 'yield strength' and 'ultimate strength'. In straightening these bars out you will be working well below the limits and it is unlikely the bars will 'snap off'. Surface scratches to aluminium bars are a bigger danger to them than a 'little bit of bending', and if you really want to see the bars fail quickly, just drill a very small hole in them near the stem...!  </p>

<p>I have actually had aluminium handlebars fail (yes I was an idiot and drilled a small hole in them, but I was 15 at the time) and that happened down a big hill. The failure was not actually completely sudden and I did not crash. I have also straightened out a lot of bikes with unorthodox means in my time and believe it is worth a go, even if the bike is not one's own.  </p>

<p>To check the track of the bike you can wrap string around the headtube and each side of the rear axle. The downtube should be in the middle, not to one side.</p>

"Biking with spinal disc herniation","6443","","<p>I was diagnosed with lumbar spinal disc herniation and told that I should exercise. I always liked biking, so I want to do that.</p>

<p>I have an older rigid mountain-bike and will be mostly driving on asphalt bike-roads. I know I should pay attention to bumps, so I stand up and use my legs and arms to take the hit.</p>

<p>Are there any more precautions I should take or things to avoid?</p>
","<p>To be very to-the-point, in your situation I would first consider the following two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rise/exchange your handlebar to leave it at least some 8 inches above the saddle height;</li>
<li>Have a good quality suspension seatpost.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have studied medicine (and have a little back pain, also), so the rationale is the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rOMKQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This figure illustrates a part of the lumbar spine, as would be seen if the rider was passing from right to left on the bike (left is front, right is back).</p>

<ul>
<li>Rising the handlebar would allow you to be more erect, thus making the upper vertebrae rotate backwards (clockwise in the figure) over the lower vertebrae. Since this rotation is articulated a bit behind the midline, there is a decompression of the discs (blue and red, with red being herniae and blue being normal disc tissue);</li>
<li>Since your bar is now higher, a greater part of your body weight is supported by your back/buttocks. Using a suspended seatpost - a relatively lowcost, minimal modification on your current rigid bike - helps avoding unpredicted/unavoidable impact, which is a main causation factor of hernia inflamation and/or progression, due to the sudden rises on internal disc pressure associated with impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't enjoy very much the feeling of sprung saddles (I have a Brooks Flyer), and I think that's because they pivot around the nose, thus bending the lower back and pelvis while going down, in a flexing motion. Seatposts, on the other side, have a translation movement, without pelvis rotation.</p>

<p>Having ridden some suspended-seatpost-equipped bikes, I can say one thing: they are awesome! And since you have a condition, thus are probably not wanting to become world champion anymore, the minimal, questionable performance decrease is overwhelmed by the very significant gains in comfort and health risk reduction.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"How do I use the plastic backing on patches?","6442","","<p>It seems that the patches I buy for fixing inner tubes come in one of 2 types. Both have metal foil on the stick-to-tube side. One has paper on the other side, the other plastic.</p>

<p>With the paper ones I can peel off the foil, glue them down, wait a minute, then split the paper from the centre and tear it off.</p>

<p>I can't do this with the plastic backing - any attempt to remove it seems to lift the edges. </p>

<p>Am I supposed to leave the plastic on, remove it before I glue the patch, or what?</p>
","<p>The <em>Rema Tip-Top</em> patches that I use--which sound similar to those which the questioner describes--come with instructions in each plastic box.  The package that I have shows the instructions pictorally in seven steps.  </p>

<p>Here is the product that I use:  <a href=""http://www.artscyclery.com/descpage-79002.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.artscyclery.com/descpage-79002.html</a></p>

<p>In step 7, <strong>the manufacturer distinctly recommends that the user remove the plastic backing.</strong>  </p>

<p>I usually remove this cellophane backing myself.  It sometimes is a little finnicky--if your patch isn't totally set it will seem to pull up the patch.  Just use your thumb to set the patch more carefully.  In the package's Step 6, the manufacturer uses a totally unidentifiable rectagular object to smooth out the patch before removing the cellophane.  I use my thumb, personally, and it works just fine.</p>

<p>If one side of the cellophane won't seem to come off without removing the patch, you didn't put down enough vulcanizing fluid.  Try the other side.  If the patch is reasonably centered, this shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>The answer about leaching chemicals is news to me--though I admit freely that I never looked farther than the instructions in the box for advice.  </p>

<p>Once in a moment of frustration, I left the cellophane on and put it into the tire--no problems so far.  I had some concern there would be a problem if the cellophane were stuck between the rim and the bead but this doesn't seem to have been a problem for Anthony K or Darren Cope.  </p>

<p>It looks as though it doesn't matter, but the manufacturer of Rema patches recommends removing it.  I say remove it carefully.  This is best done if you are generous with the vulcanizing fluid and careful to press the patch into place.  </p>

","<p>It would be one of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The rear derailleur is not center aligned on the rear cog when in that gear. Take a look at the cog and derailleur gear alignment dead on from the rear when in the noisy gear and look for vertical alignment. If it is misaligned it can be ajusted with the barrel adjuster.</li>
<li>The chain is not clearing the front derailleur guard when in this gear. Look at it from the top down when in the noisy cog and ensure no rubbing between the chain and derailleur guard. If there is rubbing the limit screws can be adjusted</li>
<li>The cog is damaged in some way causing some sort of misalignment</li>

<p>What do I need to know when buying and fitting a replacement? Are there known compatibility issues?</p>

<p>I currently have a Shimano 7-speed MF-TZ21 (apparently ""14/28"" means something in this context).</p>

<p>In case you haven't guessed: I don't know a lot about cycle part replacement.</p>
","<p>I had the same problem (48x38x28 chainset). It turned out that MF-TZ21 is actually not a 'cassette', but a 'freewheel'. Your options for that are very limited: In the UK, Raleigh is distributing a 7 speed 13-24T model for less than 10 quid. SunRace is still producing 7 speed freewheels, but the closed-spaced 12-?? model wasn't distributed in the UK: Check eBay Australia maybe.</p>

<p>I ended upgrading to hand-built wheels with a standard Shimano 8/9/10 speed 'freehub'.

"Why is the swingarm design uncommon / rare on full suspension bicycles?","6420","","<p>While watching a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAWoQlgfgwo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">snow biking video</a>, I saw that some of the bikes use a true swingarm design, which matches most motorcycles (as does much of bicycle technology). While this looks rather interesting, I'm wondering why it's so uncommon (and much more common are multi-linkage, seemingly more complex designs)?</p>

<p>I've found the bicycle he was riding, a <a href=""http://chumbaracing.blogspot.com/2010/05/black-gold-f5-show-bike-from-france.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chumba F5</a>, shown here:</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say it was solely weight concerns to not use this design with less moving parts. It also (seems to) allow for more travel, so is there perhaps an upper limit on how much travel you can get with the multi-linkage design?</p>

<p>Further, I've seen the Y-Frames (especially on BSOs) criticized for having poor flex characteristics. Does it again just come back to the weight issue in that more reinforcement is required for these designs?</p>
","<p>This swing arm design has fallen into near complete disuse in the bicycle world for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, there is translated suspension activation from pedaling. This design does not isolate pedaling or other rider generated forces from ground generated forces. Because of that, there is a loss of efficiency which makes it a poor choice for a bicycle suspension design.</li>
<li>Second, the travel path of a single pivot swing arm carries the wheel forward as it moves through its travel path, because of the arc described by the wheel. If your rear brake is in use, the wheel is prevented from following that arc, and some or all of your suspension travel is lost until the brake is released. In a 4 bar linkage design, or similar vertical travel design, brake activation does not prevent suspension activation. Thus it has become the default design for high quality dual suspension bikes. </li>

<p>A trained cyclist can definitely ride farther and faster on a road bike than on a hybrid bike, based solely on wind resistance and bicycle fit. However, the speeds you list are completely unrealistic. Bike speeds are based primarily on the rider. Other major considerations include the route and the physical shape you want to arrive in.</p>

<p>A 30 mile commute means you are riding 15 miles in each direction. I know a lot of people who bicycle commute this distance every day. They are all in excellent physical shape and ride at least 2,000 miles a year. <em>(3,218 kilometers)</em></p>

<p>Assuming:</p>

<ol>
<li>A 15 mile route with few if any stops</li>
<li>A good road surface (paved, minimal bumps)</li>
<li>Few intersecting roads</li>
<li>Dry weather</li>
<li>Fairly flat ride</li>
</ol>

<p>All of the commuters I know could easily finish the ride in less than 1 hour. <em>(averaging over 15 mph)</em>. Many of them could average 18 mph for the entire ride. A few might be able to average 20 - 21 mph.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, They will all arrive at their destination dripping sweat and need a shower and a change of clothing. If it rains, your average speed will go down significantly, since it just isn't safe to ride as fast on wet pavement.</p>

<p>So practically speaking, unless you are a highly trained athlete, doing 15 miles any faster than 20 - 21 mph is probably out of the question. Much more likely that you will do 15 - 18 mph. <strong>(And that's for a trained cyclist.)</strong> You then have to worry about cleaning up once you reach your office.</p>

<p>Getting one of the special bikes you mentioned will most likely <strong>slow you down</strong>, since they are designed for ultra high speeds with gearing that simply won't work in a city.</p>

<p>For example, SRAM recommends 6mm gap between the upper pulley and the largest cog. How is it going to affect shifting performance if the gap is, say, 3mm? Or 8mm?</p>
","<p>The B-screw controls the body angle of the derailleur. It pulls the pulleys away from the sprockets, so you don't rub against them.

<p>Its a somewhat insensitive adjustment once you clear the cogs, but the closer you are to the loosest screw value which works (i.e. the closest pulley to cog), the better your shifting will be. If you set it too close, note that a bicycle moves, so you need to allow some tolerance due to vibrations and what not. Set it too far and your shifting won't be as crisp as it should be: ""Since a derailer shift is caused by forcing the chain to run at an angle, the greater the angle, the sooner it will shift.

"Arguments for/against bike lanes?","6370","","<p>What are the arguments for and against bike lanes? Can anyone summarize the best reasons they're good for and bad for cyclists and automobile drivers? </p>

<p>For example, Are there some environments particularly suited for bike lanes? Are there some types of locales that would be particularly suited for them, where they wouldn't cause resentment? </p>
","<p><strong>AGAINST</strong></p>

<p>One of my primary issues with bike lanes is that motorists tend to think that you have to stay in that lane.  So when you have to move right because of debris, garbage cans or parked cars in the lane it further annoys ill-informed drivers.</p>

<p>Additionally, drivers come to expect you to be out of traffic, riding on the shoulder, and will squeeze by you closer.</p>

<p>Many bike lanes are placed immediately to the left (traffic-side, may be right depending on the country) of the parking area, so if you remain in the bike lane you are in the ""door zone"".</p>

<p>Bike lanes tend to increase confusion and conflict at intersections, either forcing the cars to cross the lanes in an awkward manner, or enticing cyclists to filter to the front of the lane and possibly blocking turning actions by motorists. Bike lanes encourage passing on the right, which can be a very dangerous action for the cyclist.</p>

<p>Finally - by law in most places <strong>every lane is a bike lane</strong>... there is no possible way for designated bike lanes and routes to be marked to every destination I would like to visit, and by law when I am in the lane <strong>I am traffic, I'm not blocking traffic</strong>. (<em>sorry, I get a little militant about bike lanes, especially when they are the primary focus of improved cycling infrastructure rather than wider roads with calmer traffic.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>FOR</strong></p>

<p>As someone with some experience teaching workshops for new bike commuters, I find that the existence of convenient bike lanes and multi-use paths makes taking those first trips easier.  Novice commuters feel more comfortable riding on a marked bike lane, even if they don't realize that they may be marginally less safe in a bike lane at the far right edge of the roadway, generally a riskier position.</p>

<p>There are some places, like one particularly popular area in Salt Lake City, where rather than position a lane demarcated with white lines to the side of the travel lane, the DOT painted a wide green lane with bike icons almost in the middle of the right-most travel lane and erected signs that read ""Bicycles Allowed Full Use of Lane.""   This is not a bike lane, but a hybrid or shared-lane, and  I love it because it reinforces the fact that bikes are traffic, and roads must be shared. </p>

<li>a hand punch (spring punch)</li>
<li>a small paint brush for applying flux, and a wire brush for removing it (if you're brazing)</li>

The <a href=""http://www.atomiczombie.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Atomic Zombie</a> crew or other garage homebuilders would be perfect if there's a group like that near you. Recumbent homebuilders are often equally useful and will probably help you even if you want to build a wedgie.</p>

<p>The advantage is that you built it yourself, and if you want something unusual you can build it. The disadvantage is that it's an expensive, time-consuming way to get an inferior bike. The first one you build will not be professional quality, you'll be lucky if it works at all. So if you want a traditional diamond frame bike the only reason to build it is because you can (<a href=""http://www.littlefishbicycles.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like Suzy did</a>). If you want a weird bike then you might find you have to either pay a professional framebuilder or do it yourself. Unless you already have a metalworking shop, it's cheaper to pay someone, even if they've never done anything like your bike before (so you get a first attempt that kinda works).</p>

<p>The reward is that you get something you built yourself. It's especially fulfilling when someone you approached initially who refused to build it sees your version and turns it into a commercial product (<a href=""http://www.greenspeed.com.au"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Greenspeed</a> make a tandem that converts to a solo trike now, because I showed them it could be done).</p>

"What do you wish someone had told you before your first commute?","6353","","<p>Four times a year I teach a workshop called ""Be a Bike Commuter"" for the local university's community education program.  It's mostly based on my experience and information from the League of American Bicyclists.  I am looking at making some changes for the next session and am wondering, from other experienced commuters, what things you wish someone would have told you that would have made your first few commutes more successful and/or enjoyable.</p>
","<p>My suggestion would be:</p>

<p><strong>Scout and rehearse your route before you start.</strong> </p>

<p>This is really an exercise in two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>First part is to determine what your initial routes from home to work and from work to home (not necessarily the same, certainly not in detail) are going to be. And to work out where you're going to secure your bike for the day.</li>
<li>Second part is to ride the route with no time pressure ""off peak"" (ideal is probably on a Sunday) so that you know where you're going and you don't get surprised (lost!) when you're riding to arrive on time - it should also enable you clear up any grey areas on your planned route. As importantly, this will give you an indication of how long you should allow for the journey. If you know where you're going and how long its going to take you're going to be more able to focus your attention on riding safely and less distracted by navigation and time concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once your commute is established I'd suggest that fairly regularly you allow yourself a bit more time (much easier going home!) to explore alternative routes - especially for urban commuters. The most obvious routes are not always the best, you may find shortcuts that are faster or routes that are prettier or have less traffic or smoother surfaces or that you simply like better (or that are not really very different but allow you to vary your route from time to time ""just because"").</p>

"Is my bike getting ruined?","6352","","<p>I have a <a href=""http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/bikes/model/trance.27.5.2/18763/76210/"">2015 Giant Trance</a> that is about 3 weeks old. Used pretty much every weekend. It's kept in a shed (fully covered,  no insulation just a regular shed), after every ride I give it a nice clean with a hose lightly over top, use an air compressor then use a micro fiber cloth to dry down and tidy up. My bolts, chain and discs for my brakes seem to have a lot of rust on them for 3 weeks old.</p>

<p>I have 2 questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is this rust bad for my bike and if so, how do I remove it?</p></li>
<li><p>Is cleaning it with a hose, using the air compressor then the cloth bad for the bike and maybe making it rust?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry if this is hard to understand, feel free to ask questions to know more.<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>P.S. Where I am from there is a lot of sulphur in the air (it's bad enough people visiting smell it very easily) so maybe that could be apart of it? It's also summer (southern hemisphere) and our trails are mainly in the trees, with the occasional tracks where trees have been cut down. Hope this helps.</p>
","<p>I read Chris Cleeland's answer and was appalled that his was the accepted answer.  Let me first state that I used to be a bike mechanic, and I ride through inclement weather year round.  </p>

<p>As another already stated, WD40 is useful for cleaning, but you should <em>never</em> use it on your drive-train (chain, freewheel, front cogs).  </p>

<p>You wrote that you are concerned that:  "" My bolts, chain and discs for my brakes "" are getting rusty.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Chain rust is terrible for your bike and should be guarded against carefully.  If your chain is already rusted, I recommend you go ahead and replace it immeidately.  Rust on your chain will wear your casset and chainring, so it's not worth saving the money on replacing the chain only to have to replace the cassette later.  I'll tell you how to care for you chain below.</li>
<li>The bolts rusting is not really a big deal, although it's ugly, and will make maintenance harder.  You can buy stainless-steel rust-free bolts and replace these for a minimal cost, which I do on all my bikes as soon as I see a bit of rust.  You can also buy expensive titanium bling, but I consider that a waste of money.  When you replace the bolts, pay attention to the torque (rotational force) and don't overtighten them.  Do one at a time, especially on the headset, so you don't have to worry about changing the settings (if you loosen all the headset bolts at once, for example, you'll have to adjust the headset).</li>
<li>I was surprised to hear you have rust on your disk brakes since I've never seen that before (I worked as a mechanic pre-disc brakes, and I never see rust on the bikes I currently maintain).  I did a bit of googling around, and it seems to be a common problem.  It's only cosmetic so you can safely ignore it -- any rust on the braking surface will quickly be scraped away when you brake.    But since I hate rust, I would suggest rubbing it off with a scotch-brite pad -- but nothing which might leave an oily residue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay -- now how to keep care of your bike:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is just opinion, but I suggest lightening up on the cleaning.  A little dirt on an mtb just shows you actually ride.  I generally just knock the mud off with a brush and water, so it's not a chore to do maintenance.  I do try to keep the deraillers, pedals, chainring and cassette reasonably tidy  (Brush and low-pressure hose is plenty).  Keeping your brakes and drive train clean and well maintained is important however.</li>
<li>I would never ever ever use a pressure washer or compressed air to clean a bike.  Your components have well engineered seals to keep out water and dirt, but they are not designed to protect against a pressure washer or compressed air.  You might make your bike look pretty, but degrade the mechanics.   It can also drive dirt hard across your paint job scratching it up, so even on the static parts I wouldn't use it.  A good scrub brush is much safer, and works just as well.</li>
<li><strong>How to maintain your drive train</strong>  This is surprisingly easy, but few people do it right.  First buy a lube that is appropriate to the weather you have.  Your local bike shop can help you out there.  Then always ensure that your chain has a <em>light coat of oil</em>.  A light coat of lube means enough to lube it, but not enough to retain dirt.  If you get black print of oil on your hand when you touch it -- you've oiled too much.  Too much oil is as bad as too little, since oil grabs dirt, and dirt wears down your drive train.  To oil your chain, just to the following:  1.  put some oil on the chain.  2. hold a rag against the chain and cycle the chain through the rag until no more oil ends up on the chain.  If you have a really dirty chain, and you get black ugly muck on the rag, you can repeat this process a few times.  Do this regularly and it's super quick process.  I suggest you never oil your chain without wiping it with a rag afterwards.  </li>
</ol>

<p>I generally oil and wipe my chain once every couple of weeks, and whenever I've done a really wet or muddy ride.  Once in a while I'll pop the rear wheel off and clean the cassete if I notice it's getting gunky, but if you keep the chain well maintained this isn't often necessary.  Same with the chainwheels.</p>

<p>As for WD-40 -- I'll use it to clean the chainwheels or cassette sometimes (wiping it away well afterwards), but I wouldn't ever spray in on the chain.  It dilutes your lube, making it less effective.  It's great on cables and bolts, but be careful not to let it slop over onto your disk brakes.  </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

"Not feeling good after a ride","6350","","<p>After a ride, usually about 15-30 minutes after a ride, I sometimes don't feel very good. I'll feel sleepy, lazy, lethargic or mentally foggy. It's not a physical tired. And often it doesn't take a great deal of riding to feel this way. For example, today I did about 15 miles and felt this way shortly afterwards. </p>

<p>I'm in pretty descent physical condition (I think), and I can ride 20-30 miles, at a steady 15-17 mph, without too much effort. But I'm really confused why I feel this way. I could/maybe should, see a doctor, but I thought I would check here first to see if anyone else experiences this.</p>
","<p>First off, can you explain a bit more about how you ""don't feel very good""?  Do you feel at all queasy?  Do you feel especially weak?</p>

<p>Also, how often do you exercise so intensely, and how long have you been doing it?</p>

<p>And how long does this period of feeling unwell typically last?</p>

<p>Anyway, there are several possibilities (though most apply to rides longer than 15 miles):</p>

<p>-- Dehydration.  Especially in warmer weather you need to drink plenty of water or other fluids.  We've had arguments here as to how much, but it's not a bad idea to down a 21-oz bottle of water every two hours or so, as very rough guide -- more in hotter weather.</p>

<p>-- Low sodium.  Again, in warmer weather it's quite possible for someone who exercises intensely to sweat off so much salt that the sodium levels in their body are not sufficient.  (This effect can be doubled if the individual consumes an extremely low-sodium diet.)  This results in fatigue and lethargy, and in extreme cases can be life-threatening, especially if mistaken for dehydration (which has similar symptoms) resulting in ""water intoxication"".</p>

<p>-- Low blood sugar.  When you exercise you first consume the sugar in the blood stream, then the liver and muscles start converting stored glycogen to sugar.  Several other mechanisms kick in as well.  Especially in someone who has not trained extensively, this mechanism may not be able to supply the body with enough sugar and low blood sugar can result.  In addition, some people suffer from what's known as ""reactive hypoglycemia"", where blood sugar drops paradoxically after a meal, after exercise, or at certain times of the day.</p>

<p>-- Ketosis.  If blood sugar gets too low for too long the body begins to burn fat and protein directly.  This results in the production of ketones which are released into the blood stream.  This again results in an unwell feeling, including nausea, extreme fatigue, lethargy, and ""brain fog"".  (Ketosis in particular will knock you on your butt for 2-3 days if it gets bad.  Most other conditions listed here you can recover from in a few hours at most, if properly treated.)</p>

<p>-- Blood pressure fluctuations.  Some people experience fairly extreme changes in blood pressure after exercising.  This is usually short-lived, but can produce a wide variety of symptoms, from pounding headache to fatigue and fainting.</p>

<p>-- Neurotransmitter fluctuations.  It's well known that exercise (especially intense exercise) causes the release of a number of neurochemicals.  This is cause of the so-called ""runner's high"".  And, of course, when one is ""high"", one will eventually ""come down"", and the result is a sort of ""withdrawal"" from the endorphins produced while exercising.</p>

<p>My guess is that you're experiencing a combination of slightly low blood sugar and the neurotransmitter ""withdrawal"", maybe combined with a touch of dehydration.  Eating some sweet or starchy snack every 30-60 minutes while riding will help to level the blood sugar (and if it's a bit salty, all the better). Drink a cup or two of water with the snack.</p>

<p>And when you finish the intense part of the ride, take a leisurely spin around the block or whatever for 5-10 minutes to ""cool down"" -- not your temperature so much as your endorphins.</p>

<p>(You can, of course, experiment with different combinations of the above to try to narrow down what's the primary cause of your particular symptoms.)</p>

<p>But (though the doctor's checkup is never a bad idea) I wouldn't worry about it too much.  After all, you've just participated in the second-best activity a man can experience, so a little let-down afterwards is to be expected.</p>

"Putting wider wheels on a hybrid bike","6346","","<p>I've recently had a bike donated to me by a friend so I can start commuting to work. It's a hybrid style bike, and uses 700x32C tyres. My ride to work is along a pretty bumpy, muddy canal path and my feeling is that the tyres currently on the bike are a bit too narrow for the terrain. I'm very new to cycling, and particular bike maintenance, so this might be a dumb question, but can I replace the wheels on the bike with something wider? If so, what measurements should I take from the bike to make sure I get something that fits?</p>
","<p>Frame clearance can be a problem, especially if the mud is sticky and the tire too close - it can clog up quite badly if you go too wide. If you have V brakes, these can also, however my experience has been worst case is new brake pads. </p>

(As Always - <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html</a> has the answer), so you now have a wide range of tires to choose from.

I'm only getting relatively cheap ones but I can't find an obvious description of the benefits/disadvantages.</p>
","<p>Galvanised ones rust eventually. Especially in the high wear areas. Stainless steel ones don't rust, but possibly don't deal quite as well with sharp curves.</p>

<p>How strict is this recommendation?
Could I fit a 30mm wide tire on that rim despite the fact that 30 > 28?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com"">Sheldon</a> has a <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#width"">chart</a> that shows what width of tire fits on what rim based on the width of the rim. He also notes that people often exceed the recommended widths with no adverse effects. He also notes the possible problems with straying too far outside the recommended widths. </p>

<p>It's also worth noting that tire width measurements aren't well standardized. Much like shoe and clothing sizes, some manufacturers' sizes may run a bit large or a bit small. They're really more like guesstimates.</p>

<p>This is due to a couple of factors. Manufacturers are under market pressure to produce the lightest components possible. If they can shave off a few grams by calling a 24mm tire 23mm, they just might do that. There's also the fact that the rim width effects the overall inflated width of the tire. If one manufacturer is building a tire with the intent that it's mounted on 17mm rim and another builds the exact same tire but bases it on a 21mm rim, the resulting measurement will be different. </p>

<p>Two millimeters over the recommended maximum is probably still going to be just fine. </p>

<p>My LBS (big chain store) just said they get a large, vacuum packed bag of rags delivered from head office every so often. They were kind enough to give me a bunch for free and they seem to be old bedsheets. Whilst I could go to a charity shop and buy some sheets, I'm not keen on cleaning my bike with something that someone might want to buy to wear.</p>

<p>What do you use as rags and where do you get them from?</p>

<p>Do I have to wait until everything dries inside the inner tube (could take a long time) or is this is some kind of lube that comes inside it? If so, is it fair to say I don't have to worry and I can apply the patch with no problem? </p>
","<p>There is a type of whitish liquid sealant that some folks (shops, manufacturers) put inside tubes, so that if you have a small puncture it is autimatically sealed by the liquid, which solidifies around the tiny puncture.</p>

<p>From what you say, it is not possible to say if that is the case, or if the puncture is larger and water went inside the tube. That would theoretically allow for the powder inside the tube to form a gooish liquid, although I doubt there would be enough amount of water for it to be noticeable.</p>

<p>From my experience, patch glue doesn't mix well with these white sealants, in every tube I patched that already had this liquid the patch got loose soon after, resulting in another flat. So I gave up these sealants forever, unless something new and different appears.</p>

<p>I would suggest, in this case of doubt, that you use the tube's rubber for another stuff (tying something at home ;oP ) and buy a new tube. That is not so expensive, and buyng new tubes is integral part of cycling, anyway. Besides, you could cut the old tube to look inside it and get more info which could save you future trouble (Where did this tube come from? Would other new tubes contain the same liquid? Was it sealant or just water? Etc.)</p>

"Why did my tire explode?","6312","","<p>Been running a set of quite nice slicks at 120-140 PSI for a couple of months. Might have done 400-600 km on the bike in that time. Tonight the rear tire exploded while the bike was sitting in my entryway. It's split right along the seam, with a roughly 2 inch long gap. Very loud bang etc.</p>

<p>Before I go out and buy another $70 tire, I want to get an idea of what caused this. Some possibilities that I've thought of include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running the tire at 140 PSI. The tire is rated to that pressure, but maybe this is still too much?</li>
<li>Some brief stretches of gravel road (1-2km) I did on it last weekend. The bike seemed fine then however.</li>
<li>There is a central heating/cooling vent directly adjacent to where the bike is stored. Perhaps the changes in temperature were enough to damage the tire?</li>
<li>The roads in this area are not always very good. Maybe this is just the result of accumulated damage from dozens of minor nicks and bumps?</li>
<li>The tire could be defective. </li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: added a picture. Looks like the tube has a ~1cm hole in it.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDVnd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>From the picture it appears that the tire simply failed.  It may have gotten ""bruised"" at some point, or the cord may have simply fatigued to the point of failure.  </p>

<p>Without examining it in person it's hard to tell where the split started, but it appears to have split mostly along the joint between tread and the white sidewall.  In general, white sidewalls make the tire weaker, both because the white material is not as durable and because there's a necessary seam between sidewall and tread.</p>

<p>Also, the tire likely has some sort of belt under the tread area, and, in such a narrow tire, that can result in fatigue along the edge of the belt.</p>

<p>The heating/cooling vent could have been a factor if hot air were blowing directly on one spot on the tire, but seems unlikely if it was cooling air.</p>

<p>And, of course, it's always possible that you had cut/bruised the tire at some point and it finally let go.</p>

<p>Age would be another suspect, but you indicate you've only had the tires a few months, and it would take several years for that to be a factor.</p>

I know I can gradually adjust braking on front and back to come out of the skid, but I was wondering if i should replace my tires to get a little more grip.  My LBS seems to think thin slicks are fine however.  Is there a study or data on tire types on wet pavement? </p>
","<p>If you are riding on the road, slicks are fine in the wet. If you need to go over any mud, etc. then you'll need something else.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tires.html#tread"">Sheldon Brown</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bicycle tires for on-road use have no need of any sort of tread
  features; in fact, the best road tires are perfectly smooth, with no
  tread at all!</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, most people assume that a smooth tire will be slippery,
  so this type of tire is difficult to sell to unsophisticated cyclists.
  Most tire makers cater to this by putting a very fine pattern on their
  tires, mainly for cosmetic and marketing reasons. If you examine a
  section of asphalt or concrete, you'll see that the texture of the
  road itself is much ""knobbier"" than the tread features of a
  good-quality road tire. Since the tire is flexible, even a slick tire
  deforms as it comes into contact with the pavement, acquiring the
  shape of the pavement texture, only while in contact with the road.</p>
  
  <p>People ask, ""But don't slick tires get slippery on wet roads, or worse
  yet, wet metal features such as expansion joints, paint stripes, or
  railroad tracks?"" The answer is, yes, they do. So do tires with tread.
  All tires are slippery in these conditions. Tread features make no
  improvement in this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also worthy of note is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Car and truck tires need tread, because these vehicles are prone to a
  very dangerous condition called ""hydroplaning."" This happens when
  driving fast in very wet conditions, which can lead to the tire riding
  up onto a cushion of liquid water. When this happens, there is a
  sudden and total lack of traction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bicycles can <strong>NOT</strong> hydroplane because:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bicycle tire has a curved road contact. Since a bicycle leans in
corners, it needs a tire with a rounded contact area, which tends to
push the water away to either side.</li>
<li>A bicycle tire is narrower, so not as much water is in contact with
the leading edge at once.</li>
<li>The high pressure of bicycle tires is more efficient at squeezing the
water out from under.</li>
<li>At high speeds, hydroplaning is just possible for car tires, but is
absolutely impossible for bicycle tires.</li>

<p>I use this as my guide (i.e. I try and keep my cadence within a certain range no matter what the gradient) - if I am able to pedal comfortably at over 80rpm, then its time to change to a bigger gear. If I'm unable to pedal comfortably at 65rpm, its time to go to a smaller gear.</p>

<p>That's my scientific approach. Alternatively, when it starts hurting I change down, and when it feels too easy I change up. But again I'm trying to maintain a constant-ish cadence. Climbing hills obviously takes it out of you as you're climbing them but generally speaking it should only be a short while (minutes) after you've passed the summit before you're able to pedal as normal.</p>

<p>But over that kind of distance you'll need to take your nutrition seriously - keeping your energy levels up will be to key to allowing you to control your cadence.</p>

"26"" vs 28"" wheels for touring","6257","","<p>I was told by a friend that 26"" wheels are better than 28"" wheels for touring. Is this true? What are the pro's and con's? </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm told that 26"" wheels are stronger for their spoke count. What are the practical implications of this? </li>
<li>Are there other reliability concerns? and how much of a concern/win are they?</li>
<li>Does one size have an advantage in terms of ease of carrying a heavy load? </li>
<li>Does one have an advantage in terms of the sorts of terrain it can traverse? </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some context</strong>: We're going on a 800km trip in southern Germany and I'm looking to acquire a decent bike for this trip, and hopefully many other such trips (potentially more adventurous ones too). I basically just want to pick up a good base bike that I slowly build on and figure that I should invest in a frame that supports the right size of tires from the start.</p>
","<p>For reference for non-Germans, 28"" means 700c. </p>

<p>Most touring bikes do ship with 700c wheels these days (for not short riders - short riders often get 26"" or 650b wheels) and they work fine for people - the key is to have well built wheels for touring (for loaded touring, this means high spoke counts, good spokes and rims and hubs and the wheel being put together properly). If you like a good touring bike which comes in 26"" for your size but not 700c, then get the 26"". Likewise, if you only have the 700c option, get it. This choice should mean good bike fit and decent quality components.</p>

<p>So, I think the answer for all of them is pretty much a wash - you can find a good wheel which works in either size for almost everybody. </p>

<p>Note that you want big tires for touring, so the air cushions you, but touring frames generally have this built in. </p>

"How to prevent drafting?","6227","","<p>I am engaging in a friendly race with a co-worker. He has told me he plans on drafting behind me most of the race to save energy.   </p>

<p>I want to make it hard for him(without doing anything mean spirited) to draft off me.  In general, in racing situations, <strong>what strategies can you employ to stop competitors from drafting?</strong></p>

<p>In this specific case he is a probably a better more experienced rider and I am the novice. </p>

<p>UPDATE:  Thanks everyone for the advice.  What I decided on doing were some intervals so I was not going at a constant pace.  I wanted to go my own tempo, and if my coworker wanted to draft bad enough(he didn't) he would have to go my tempo.  A side note, I got a better bike which may have more to do with the win then preventing him drafting, but a win is a win.  </p>
","<p>In road racing there are lots of way to try and gain an advantage (or not to give others an advantage).  Because this is a friendly race, I will break it down into friendly, indifferent and hostile tactics. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Update 1:</strong> 
  <em>The OP updated their question to make it clear <strong>that they were a beginner</strong> and the other rider was a more experienced road rider. So I have added a paragraph at the bottom discussing the importance of how a tactic or strategy is executed.</em> </p>

  <em>A fun video:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAf51SoqTKU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How To Get Rid Of Wheelsuckers</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>1) Friendly tactics</h2>

<p>These tactics are intended to keep the competition friendly by letting your friend draft, but with the intent of making a decisive move at some point to win, which will clearly demonstrate that you were the stronger rider on the day.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First over the line wins</strong> -  Simply put, keep the ride relaxed until near the end, then launch and maintain a strong attack that your friend cannot match.  This keeps them in the ""competition"" until the end, they save face by staying in until the end and you save face with your devastating tactic.  You can even let your friend take pulls to make it look fair.  The down side is that they may come away thinking the competition was closer than it really was.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained Efforts:</strong> There are a couple situations where the advantage of drafting is reduced, you can then use these situations to launch a sustain effort in an attempt to ride them off your wheel, thereby gaining the advantage.

<ul>
<li><em>Climbs:</em> As many others have pointed out, a significant climb is a good way to put distance on another ride.  Depending on how badly you want to rub it in you can control the distance.</li>
<li><em>False Flats</em>: False flats are sections that appear to be flat but are actually have a slight incline.  If you do not have a computer that shows this (e.g., Garmin) the slight inclines can make you feel very slow.  Attacking with a sustained effort on a false flat is a great way to put a gap on someone, especially if you know it is a false flat, but they do not.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Indifferent tactics</h2>

<p>These tactics are a little more aggressive than (1) and may be fair game depending on your friendship and views on competitive behaviour.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surge Attacks</strong> - If someone is drafting a good way to shake them time a short attack where you can put a bit of distance and break their draft, thereby negating their advantage. 

<ul>
<li><em>Fast/Faster</em> - For example you can ride at a strong tempo, wait to see if they are straining then do a short burst attack to gain a gap.  They will be tired from holding on earlier and now suddenly out in the full wind.  This will demoralize them greatly.</li>
<li><em>Slow/Fast</em> - Similar to Fast/Faster you will be using changes in speed to break a draft.  In this case start to casually slow down, this will usually leave someone wondering what is going on... then attack to open a gap and break a draft.</li>
<li><em>Change direction and surge</em> - If you change directions suddenly (e.g., zig or zag across the road, but no zig-zagging) while surging you can instantly remove the drafting advantage which can make it more difficult for the drafter to close the gap. (thank you @altomnr)</li>
<li><em>Catch them when they are sleeping</em>  - Wait until there is a real lull in the ""competition"" to suddenly surge and break the draft.</li>
<li><em>Conversation to attack</em> - At some point get into a friendly conversation, build a story and just as it starts to get really interesting (and your friend lets down their guard)... attack!  Catching someone off guard is a quick way to break a draft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Using the wind</strong>:  If you live in a windy area and you know the route you can

<ul>
<li><em>Attacking into a headwind</em>: this can be used in multiple ways.  One of the best ways is if you have an out and back course with a head wind on the way out, attacking a few km before the turn-around can be a decisive way to score a victory.</li>
<li><em>Guttering</em>: If you get a cross wind (that requires an <a href=""http://cyclingmagazine.ca/sections/training-guide/technique/riding-in-an-echelon/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">echelon</a> in order to draft, you can ride next to the edge of the road to ""gutter"" the drafting rider.  Because draft position is effectively off the road-way and they cannot move off the road way into the draft they lose the ability to draft and have to do the same amount of work.  This is a good time to attack.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Repeat attacks</strong>: If you are in a lot better shape you can launch a series of repeat attacks in quick succession.  They may be able to hold on to one or two attacks, but stacking the attacks will eventually wear them out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Hostile Tactics &amp; Cheating</h2>

<p>Depending on how much you value your friendship (e.g., <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenemy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frenemies</a>), there are also some hostile techniques that I have come across in races over the years.  I document them for completeness sake to indicate what should generally not consider as a strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> In no way should the ""forcing an error"" tactics be used against your friend as these tactics can potentially send someone to the hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Forcing an error</strong>:

<ul>
<li><em>Attacking on technical descents</em>:  If you are a more skilled descender you can use this to your advantage by encouraging someone to try and keep pace, thereby taking them out of their skill level. People will often over shoot corners and otherwise get shaken forming a gap.  At worse you may cause someone to crash and have an injury.</li>
<li><em>Overcooking corners</em>:  Another horrible way is to deliberately overcook a fast corners so that you can just hang on, but with the intent of forcing them to go off the road or crash.</li>
<li><em>Riding into hazards</em>: Another way to shake a drafter is take them into hazards such as pot holes, or riding within less of an inch of the side of the road.  The idea is to fake them into letting off.</li>
<li><em>Brake checking</em>:  There is a special place in hell for those that brake check, but it is effective way to shake someone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Using a vehicles wake</strong>.  If you are a stronger sprinter jumping into a vehicles draft for a period of time allowing you to surge ahead</li>
<li><strong>Lie</strong>: While your friend is drafting casually say: ""You know I am just not feeling it today... do you want to call it quits?""  Then while they are thinking follow this with a decisive strike.</li>
<li><strong>Change the goal posts</strong>:  Near the end if your friend is still drafting suddenly sprint for a arbitrary close finish line.  Claim victory!  As an extension, in the post finish confusion, attack again to actually win.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The Importance of Execution</h2>

<p>The <em>tactics</em> and <em>strategy</em> outlined above will rely heavily on <em>execution</em>, which can be difficult for beginners.  Many new riders will only partially commit to a tactic, holding back for fear that it might not work out. The ""secret"" is that once you decide on a tactic you really have to commit everything to it (i.e., willingness lose and look like a fool). Otherwise it is only a half strength attack which is easier for the other rider to survive. The more experienced rider will be practiced in the determination needed to knuckle down and survive an attack (even though they may be less fit overall).  This mental strength and experience can make them a formidable opponent if you do not fully commit to a strategy or tactic.</p>

<p>It can take time and practice for beginners to develop the ""killer"" instinct needed for success, so don't get discouraged if a chosen strategy doesn't work first time out. Sometimes you just have to keep <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throw_enough_mud_at_the_wall,_some_of_it_will_stick"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">throwing mud at the wall to get some to stick.</a></p>

","<p>The back wheel is the wheel bearing most of the weight and also the wheel providing the driving force.

"How high should brake levers be on drop bars?","6181","","<p>How high on the curve of the drop bars should brake levers be placed? Also, how does the angle of the drop bars affect the brake position?</p>

<p>If these settings are dependant on body shape and physiology, is there a way to work out the optimum position for a given person?</p>
","<p>Different brands and component levels of levers have different shapes, and different bars have different amounts of drop and different curvatures. Arne's suggestion of lining the tips of the brake levers to be even with the flat part of the drops is a common rule of thumb to get you started. If the bars are already installed on the bike you can do this with a ruler or something else flat and rigid. I found a decent image illustrating just how to do this, albeit on an older bike:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zifk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice that the owner has left a quarter inch gap above level. This is where the ergonomics of the components you are running and your own personal preference come into play. If you are unsure, I would start with this basic rule of thumb and work from there. A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>moving the levers too far up or down on the bars is going to give you weird ergonomics in terms of hand positions and lever reach from the drops</li>
<li>once you have the levers set where you want them, be careful of twisting the bars too far up or down in the stem as this will also give you weird ergonomics. On newer setups you typically want to start with the transition from the bars to the hoods being pretty much parallel with the ground</li>
<li>once the tape is installed on the bars you only have so much wiggle room to slide the levers up or down. Ultimately if you feel like you can't move them enough with the tape in place then you're probably trying to make too big of a change- unless you started with them clamped way too low or way too high on the bars. A little change can make a big difference, so make small adjustments and then go for a good ride to try it out.</li>

"How do I tell if jockey wheels need overhaul or replacement?","6174","","<p>I am refurbishing a bike and am deciding how much to clean out the rear derailleur.  It's in pretty good shape.  But after I take off the chain, I tried spinning the jockey wheels with my fingers (after cleaning grime off the sides), and they only spin as long as I'm touching/pushing them -- they don't spin freely.  Should I be concerned enough to take apart the derailleur and clean/re-oil or re-grease the jockey wheels?</p>
","<p>If the teeth on the jockey wheels appear to be in good shape then you probably have nothing to worry about. Many jockey wheels use bushings instead of bearings, and either way they are not going to spin for very long just because there's not much weight to them and therefore they don't carry much inertia.</p>

<p><strong>If there is noticeable resistance when you try to turn the jockey wheel- as in it leaves an impression of the tooth on your finger when you try to spin it- then they need service.</strong> If you want to do it youself you can take the cage apart and check the bushings/bearings and replace them if needed. Servicing instructions should be available from your derailleur's respective manufacturer along with replacement part numbers. Be sure to use a very small drop of threadlocker on the threads of the bolts that hold the jockey wheels to the derailleur cage when reassembling, and be sure not to overtighten those bolts. </p>

<p>It doesn't sound like this is a problem in your situation, but for completeness I'll mention that you don't want to let the jockey wheels themselves get over-worn, either. As they wear out the teeth may become narrow and pointed or short and blunted, depending on the riding conditions and the condition of the bushings/bearings.

"Does tire pressure matter when the bicycle is in the trainer?","6167","","<p>I keep my bicycle on a trainer in a 'cool' room during the winter months.   The tires don't seem to maintain pressure after days of non use.   Does this matter, and should I be checking/filling the tires often?   What pressure would be recommended?</p>
","<p>Like car tires, bike tires can lose some pressure at colder temps (see: <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081218093516AAN3lGt"" rel=""nofollow"">Why do tires ""lose"" air during the winter?</a>) although I'd be surprised if your 'cool' room is cold enough for this to be a significant factor.</p>

<p>More likely, you are just seeing the normal slow loss of air pressure that bike tires experience all the time. </p>

<p>Since your trainer is a relatively ""controlled"" environment compared to a road, tire pressure is of less importance than it is on the road.  If your tire is under-inflated you really don't need to worry about a pinch flat or the tire coming off the rim as you corner.  Conversely, if it's a little over-inflated, you won't suffer bone jarring bumps or benefit from lower rolling resistance.</p>

<p>At worst, I think you might experience some accelerated tire wear.  Of course, my trainer seems to eat tires no matter what pressure I run my tires at...</p>

<p>Sheldon Brown has a nice write-up about <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/tires.html#pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">Tire Width and Pressure</a> which you might find interesting even though it doesn't specifically discuss tire pressure when using a trainer.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  I overlooked the <em>What pressure would be recommended?</em> part of the original question...  </p>

<p>To me, the answer to this depends on what tires you are using.  My current tires have a maximum pressure of 120psi and I run them at around 100-110psi.  In the summer I check my tires and re-inflate before every ride due to the various reasons I've listed above.  In the winter, I only check the tires occasionally as there is minimal drawback to riding a trainer with under-inflated tires.</p>

But I've seen some more advanced skills and tricks that I don't know how to do, such as bunny hops, track stands, and the like.</p>

<p>What advanced cycling skills are useful for a commuter or city rider, and how can I learn to do them? I'm interesting in things that are useful, not just showy, and interested in city riding, not mountain biking.

","<p>Some important skills for commuters:</p>

<h2>Looking directly behind you without turning.</h2>

<p>This is a surprisingly difficult skill to master. When a rider looks directly backwards, it is common to turn in the direction they twisted their head. It takes a lot of practice to make resisting that turning automatic. The importance of looking behind you in traffic should be obvious.</p>

<h2>Rapid countersteering</h2>

<p>It is not uncommon to come up to an intersection when a vehicle in the crossing direction will come in front of you, and you will not have enough time or space to stop safely. Sometimes what is required is a countersteered* turn into the direction the crossing vehicle is traveling. This requires a quick turn of the handlebars in the opposite direction you want to turn, which will cause your center of gravity to rapidly swing to the side you want to be going. Returning the handlebars to turn in the direction you want to go completes the turn, and by doing so you can turn very rapidly with a very tight radius. </p>

<p>You might not be able to stop, but it can be preferable to make a sudden turn rather than crashing into something.</p>

<h2>Stopping suddenly</h2>

<p>Not many riders are highly skilled in using their brakes. Practice slamming on your brakes, <strong>especially using only the front</strong>, and get a feel for how much force it takes to get your back wheel off the ground. Practice to the point that when you are in a panic situation you don't simply clutch the levels with every ounce of strength, practice so modulating your brake power is a purely mechanical, automatic skill. Also practice stopping on sandy, wet, and icy surfaces.</p>

<h2>Lesser but still important skills</h2>

<ul>
<li>Watching for people in parked cars that might open their door right in front of you while biking alongside them.</li>
<li>Recognizing when <a href=""http://bicyclesafe.com/"">one of the common collision</a> situations are upon you and how to respond defensively.</li>
<li>Riding on slippery surfaces.</li>
<li>Never stop at the stop line where 18 wheelers are turning, always stop a good distance behind so the truck has room to turn.</li>

<p>I don't know how T3 fits in, maybe it is the same as one of the others. </p>

<p>What are the technical differences between them? Any reason to buy one over the others? I am tempted to buy the Torpedo because I hope it will last longer, since family's bikes with Torpedo lasted forever in my childhood. </p>

<p>The webshop I'm buying from is selling both Sachs Torpedo and SRAM i-motion 3 gear, I asked them for the difference, but they were not really helpful. </p>
","<p>SRAM acquired Sachs in 1997.</p>

<p>The main visible difference between the (Fichtel &amp;) Sachs Torpedo 3 hub and the SRAM T3 is that the SRAM T3 comes in an aluminium body, whereas the Sachs Torpedo 3 comes in a chrome plated steel body and the brake design has been changed (but is compatible). There apparently was a successor model to the Sachs Torpedo 3 called Sachs Spectro T3 in between the SRAM T3 and the Sachs Torpedo 3. Around 1996 the coaster brake mechanism was changed by Sachs. So the timeline is:</p>

<p>~1977: H3111 (Sachs Torpedo 3) -> ~1996: MH3111 (Sachs Spectro T3) -> ~2000 MH3115 SRAM T3.</p>

<p>For the (Fichtel &amp;) Sachs Torpedo 3 (H3111) speed hub see:
<a href=""http://www.scheunenfun.de/f+s_h3111.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.scheunenfun.de/f+s_h3111.htm</a> (German)</p>

<p>For the Sachs Spectro T3 (MH3111) and the SRAM T3 (MH3115) see:
<a href=""http://www.scheunenfun.de/sram-t3.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.scheunenfun.de/sram-t3.htm</a> (German)</p>

<p>So those mentioned above are internally compatible, at least if you're willing to replace some parts.</p>

<p>I am not exactly sure about the i-motion 3, but SRAM states that it is the successor of the T3 hub (see <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/pdfs/sram-internal-gears.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/pdfs/sram-internal-gears.pdf</a>) it has a different shifting mechanism (a broken cable leaves it in low gear (opposed to high gear on the T3) among and some other differences, as far as I can see (see <a href=""http://cdn.sram.com/sites/default/files/techdocs/sram-techmanual-my10-gearhubsystems-english-reva.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cdn.sram.com/sites/default/files/techdocs/sram-techmanual-my10-gearhubsystems-english-reva.pdf</a>) and the internals are not compatible with the t3.</p>

<p>Some people have had problems (broken axles) with the i-motion 3 hub, whereas the old Torpedo hubs rarely break, which should be the case for the T3 as well, as it is mostly the same design (see <a href=""http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-394516.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-394516.html</a>).</p>

","<p>There does not seem to be a universal standard for bike sizing. Due to the variety of designs and geometry size will vary between manufacturers and intended use, touring, racing, commuting are all slightly different. You often hear about the importance of fit and it's relation to performance and comfort and this is where a good relationship with your LBS is key. Most brands will have a guideline to get you in a range. One brand may place you solidly on a 58cm frame a different brand might place you between a 58 and a 60. You really have to test ride several sizes and brands to see what fits. A proper fitting will take into account your geometry and the bike geometry and try to get a match. It may involve swapping stems, adding headset spacers adjusting saddle setback. These adjustments make the frame feel bigger or smaller to get you comfortable.</p>

"Bent Chainring causing chain to attempt changing gears","6110","","<p>I was riding my road bike last night when something strange happened.  I stopped at a stop sign.  (I didn't have time to slow down so I was in my highest (fastest) gear.  When I started I had to press a lot of power into my pedals to get the bike moving again.  I was pulling up on the handle bars to press more power into the pedals.  </p>

<p>A minute or two later I noticed that my bike was trying to change gears on me.  I have non indexed shifters so I expected that I was just between gears.  I adjusted the leavers but could not find a spot (in my current gear) where the chain was not trying to shift.  </p>

<p>Upon further inspection I noticed that my biggest front chainring was slightly bent.  I am not sure if posting a picture would be useful because it is hard to see when it is not spinning.  It seems like it is bent maybe 2-6mm towards the frame of the bike.  </p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Do you think that I bent my chain ring while pedaling?  It is <em>possible</em> that it was bent before but something else is now causing my problem (although I don't know what).  Is it possible that I bent my chain right by pedaling hard?  </li>
<li>What is the solution to this problem?  Can I take a hammer to my chain ring and pound it back into shape?  I think that if I do this AND it was bent by hard pedaling then it is likely that it will just be rebent by future hard pedaling.  </li>
<li>If I need to replace the chain ring how complex is this task?  Is this something relatively easy that I could do at home or do I need to take it to my LBS?  If I take it to my LBS how much should I expect to pay?</li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li><p>no, it's almost impossible that you bent it just by pedaling. Exacerbate an existing bend, yes, but bend a straight ring, no.</p></li>
<li><p>Bending it back into shape is possible, but be careful - bending metal back and forth weakens it. Do not pound it with a hammer - if you dent it you are also thinning it and making it longer. Which means it will be permanently bent. Use an adjustable wrench set to grip the chainring and try to bend around the attachment bolts, not just at the end of the wrench jaws.</p></li>
<li><p>A new chainring should be $20-$50, depending on what exactly you get. If your chainrings are not removable that means a new crankset but it also means your crankset is cheap, so it should be in that price range as well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To replace it yourself is easy and should require a 5mm allen key and a thin coin. There will be four or five bolts on the outside of the chainring, and a matching slotted nut on the inside. You can buy a special tool to grip that nut, but I find a small coin is usually enough. Taking the chainring off before trying to straighten it is not a good idea as there's too much risk of dishing the chainring.</p>

"How to setup rebound?","6098","","<p>I have fancy new full-suspension bike and both shocks have this strange setting, called <code>Rebound</code>. It's a red dial, beside the blue CTD lever.</p>

<p>Increasing it makes the shock less responsive to small obstacles. Thus, pedal bob is reduced. However, if I max it out, the shock becomes so stiff, that even jumping onto the saddle (the bike is stationary) from quite some height doesn't move it a bit.</p>

<p><em>What are some guidelines to tune my fork and rear shock for the terrain that I ride in and for my mass?</em> </p>

<p>My rear shock has CTD. Why would I ever want to limit the travel and sustain high pedal bob, when I can just increase the rebound and enjoy efficient pedaling?</p>

<hr>

<p>It is known from Linear systems, that a suspension can roughly be modeled by </p>

<pre><code>m*a + b*v + c*s = Fs, where
m - mass
a - second derivative of position with respect to time
b - damping coefficient
v - first derivative of position
c - spring coefficient
s - position
Fs - fore on the suspension element.
</code></pre>

<p>Is <code>rebound</code> the same as the coefficient <code>b</code> above? </p>
","<p>Rebound is close to b in your equations above. The guides I've seen and used recommend the following procedure for setting rear shock rebound. </p>

<p>Ride over a sidewalk curb ( ie. 4-5 inch drop ) and adjust the rebound until you have only one bounce. I.e. you want the shock to be able to absorb a hit, but not keep rebounding to cause you to lose control. </p>

<p>Setting the rebound on the front fork is similar, but not as straight forward. Find a short bumpy descent and keep doing it until you feel like you've got the best control. It's a balance between absorbing the hit and keeping control of the front wheel. If the front shock is ""bouncing"" more than once after the hit you are don't have control during the up phase.</p>

<p>If you set the rebound too high, the shock won't be able to function as designed to absorb the terrain. If you think of it as a wave form, you want the rebound to not significantly damp out the initial height of the wave, but to damp out the oscillations as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>As you get better and faster you will likely need to tweak the rebound. The trick is to always find that balance between absorbing the hit and sustaining the hit through oscillations. </p>

","<p>No, on the contrary the lead rider also gets a boost.</p>

<p>The reason to be unhappy about someone drafting you is that they're too close to be able to react if there's a problem - if you go down they will run over you.</p>

<p>The way I understand the boost is that a solo rider is effectively dragging around a volume of low pressure air - you push the air out of the way creating a high pressure volume in front of you, but that displaced air doesn't magically close in behind you, it flows out then flows back, creating a ""missing air"" volume behind you.

<p>So my question revolves around <strong>what weather conditions slicks are acceptable in:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Heavy rain?</li>
<li>Snow?</li>
<li>Ice?</li>
<li>Other...</li>
</ul>
","<p>Bike tires are treaded to grab on customers rather than the road. Obviously, different tread patterns will perform differently off road, that is: on earth, mud, gravel, sand, roots..</p>

<p>BUT - contrary to popular belief - on the road, whether it is concrete, tarmac or asphalt, treads will do nothing except offer a slightly slower ride and at the same time, less grip on the surface.</p>

<p>On car tires treads have one main function, and that is to channel away water to allow most rubber possible to be in contact with the road. Because of the broad square profile of the car tire, at higher speeds water is 'caught' by the tire too fast for it to escape to the sides, causing the tire to'float' on the water - hydroplaning. Good tread patterns can reduce this effect dramatically.
A secondary function of treaded tires - at least for most of us who seldom leave the tarmac/concrete - is of(f) course better traction on soft surfaces.
On dry tarmac/concrete treads have no effect at all, other than reducing the contact with the surface. In other words, treading will increase contact with surface driving through a puddle of rainwater, but decrease contact under dry conditions. The treaded tire is a compromise.</p>

<p>If you only own one bike with one set of wheels and you ride this bike year in and out, both on and off the road, then you would need to compromise too. But many of us sports more than one bike; we grab our MTB for trekking and reach for our roadbike/hybrid/city commuter when we're on those hard, smoother surfaces. In the latter case a treaded tire has no positive effect what so ever - even if it rains. Here's why:</p>

<p>Hydroplaning on a bike is virtually impossible. Because of the bike tires narrow rounded profile, water is lead to the sides (like a boat cutting through water), ensuring sufficient contact with the ground.</p>

<p>Then what about the wet surfaces? Those slippery curbstones, road paint, manhole covers? Won't treaded tires help at all? Apart from the placebo effect for some riders, the simple answer - backed by physics - is no. Basically, if the treaded pattern don't leave an impression on the surface, it cannot have any effect in regards to traction. You might add water or oil, still those treads will not help you. The same goes for ice. In fact, the only situation where a (heavily) treaded tire will give you better traction within the city limits might be on some types of snow.</p>

<p>All experiments on traction supports this fact and all tire developers know this, yet when you enter a bike store to buy a set of new tires for your hybrid, you are offered treaded tires over slicks in a ratio of 20:1. Why?
1. because the customer believes in treaded traction
2. the shop owner also believes this
3. the customer wants to chose between different products, and choosing between 20 different types of slicks doesn't seem to be much of a choice.
4. the customer wants something new and improved, and 'hey, you had 20 different types of slicks when I was here last'
5. the tire producers know their customers and to keep them buying their stuff - they offer  ""something new and improved"". They of course know that less costy than actually researching and developing new stuff, is making slight cosmetic changes to existing designs. Thread patterns in road bike tires most definitely belongs to the department of cosmetics.</p>

<p>So, does that mean that any (no-)treaded tire will do? Well, certainly not! Tire profile, thick vs. thin walls, type of rubber compound - there are many factors that will affect grip and traction, tread not being one of them. Also how much air you pump into a tire will affect this.</p>

<p>For those below zero winter days with ice and snow, however, a set of slicks is not recommended. But that also goes for the other regular threaded tires. The only remedy for icy roads are tires with steel/metal spikes. Unfortunately - these tires suck at anything other than icy/snowy conditions. If you live in a part of the world with cold winters, the best thing to do is loading a second pair of wheels with spiked tires, like Schwalbe Ice Spiker or Nokian Extreme, and swapping wheels when the conditions call for it.</p>

<p>I ride my bike(s) to work and for fun. I have a cheap, old ""winter bike"" for those to-and-from-work snowy days, but my other two tarmac/concrete/asphalt bikes - an old Colnago and a C.dale Bad Boy never wear anything but slicks. Infact, within city limits, I have used slicks only since the mid '90s. Yesterday I received a new pair of Schwalbe Kojak's (26/fat) for my Bad Boy = full control, come rain or shine.</p>

<p>EDIT: Regarding myself as a problem, I should add that due to a rare type of blood cancer, my blood is ""thicker"" (which is a physically incorrect term) than average, resulting in a bad (micro)circulation, especially during long exercise. Hence, an optimum solution would not increase the chance for unwanted heating, e.g. by wearing additional socks.  </p>

","<p>Presuming you are doing a standing start and coming to a complete stop at the top of the hill.  The simple requirement is you need energy to move your from the bottom to the top.  Most of the energy required will be to raise potential energy of the payload (you and the bike).  Essentially you will be creating kinetic energy (moving the bike) by converting chemical energy in your body.  There will be loses due to heat, friction with the road surface and air resistance.  </p>

<p>Disregarding them for the moment (they are not negligible, but complicate the calculation).  </p>

<p>Potential Energy (PE) = m * g * h</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>m = mass </p>

<p>g = gravitational acceleration </p>

<p>h = height</p>

<p>PE is proportional to m, so a 10% increase in mass will increase the PE by 10%.  Meaning you will need 10% more kinetic energy to get to the top of the same hill. </p>

<p>Power is work done (energy) divided by time:</p>

<p>P = W / t</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>P = Power in watts</p>

<p>W = work done or energy in Joules</p>

<p>t = time to do work.</p>

<p>If your power is constant we can rearrange the equation to get</p>

<p>P = (m * g * h)/ t</p>

<p>becomes:</p>

<p>t = (m * g * h) / P</p>

<p>so with constant power, gravity and hill height your time will increase proportional to increase in mass, given by the above equation.</p>

<p>If there is no wind air resistance will become less relevant the slower you are going.  Friction will increase due to increase in weight.  The steepness of the hill is theoretically irrelevant in this calculation.  You are gaining the same amount of Gravitation Potential energy when you the same mass to the same height.  So it shouldn't theoretically matter whether the hill is 10% or double as long and 5%.</p>

<p>However, as you are generating the energy you need to create it from chemical energy, and there is only so much you can generate at one time.  Your muscles will become inefficient and therefore on steeper hills you may require more energy than less steep ones.  So on a steeper hill wind resistance might become less relevant but power (how much energy you can put out over time) to weight ratio will become the most relevant factor.</p>

<p>What I am trying to point out in the last paragraph is that the energy you require to put into your body and for your body to convert into forward motion is not the same as the simple kinetic energy required to get you to the top of the hill.  However all things being equal a change in mass will have the same affect on the time as I stated in the equations.</p>

"What is the stopping force of your average road bike?","5991","","<p>Does anyone have any data on the stopping force of a <strong>modern road bike</strong>? IE when a road biker slams on the brakes the force applied to the ground is x.xxx Newtons (or lbf).</p>

<p>Another way to ask would be if anyone has any speed vs stopping distance vs rider weight data for road bikes.</p>

<p><strong>TO CLARIFY</strong> : I'm asking if anyone has a data set of numbers, I'm fully capable of going out and testing my own bike and doing the physics / math to obtain the information I need, but I'd just rather not do the testing. I would expect some deviation based on the kind of brakes and rims involved, but I would expect any modern road bike to have similar stopping force.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.beckforensics.com/CMRSC14BeckBicycle.pdf"">Beck Forensics have figures</a> (pdf), peaking at about 0.5g for a MTB on flat concrete. I used <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=bicycle%20braking%20rate"">this search</a> to find that paper and some of the other results look relevant.</p>

<p>The number that springs to my mind is 0.3g, but that may be for cars. <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10063"">Bicycling Science</a> or <a href=""http://www.ihpva.org/hparchive.htm"">Human Power</a> are where I would go for well-researched answers. Human Power doesn't seem to have anything, although it may just be missing from the index. </p>

<p>A great deal depends on the geometry of the bicycle, since that's the limiting factor (most bikes can throw the rider by overenthusiastic braking). A little thought experiment might help. Assume the CoG of the rider is in the hips, so about 10cm above the seat. A line from there through the front contact patch will be roughly 45 degrees above horizontal (give or take, say 15 degrees), so an upper limit of 1g is likely.</p>

<p>To further Feynman it, 10m/s is 36km/hr, so 1g would stop you from 36km/hr in one second. During which time you'd travel about 1/2at^2 or 5m (I cheated by making t=1). One simple test would therefore to sprint to 35kph then hit the brakes at a marked point and see what your stopping distance is.</p>

<p>On reflection, 1G or 10m/s/s sounds more plausible as an upper limit.</p>

"Are tow-hitch bike racks legal?","5987","","<p>I am considering buying a tow hitch and bike rack for my minivan to transport a few bikes for an upcoming vacation.  I've read a few reviews of these bike racks, and many folks have said that their license plate is not visible with these racks.</p>

<p>In the US, is there anything I need to get with my bike rack (license plate frame, extra tail lights, etc.) to make hauling my bikes legal?</p>
","<p>As others have indicated, vehicular laws vary from state to state and as such, laws about license plate display will too. </p>

<p>However, there is a lot of uniformity between states' vehicular laws. You can most likely count on a couple things regarding the display of your license plates: </p>

<ol>
<li>There is most likely a state statute dictating that your license plate must be clearly visible. How exactly they define that will vary from state to state.</li>
<li>There is also most likely a statute dictating where your license plate must be placed. I.e., not more or less than a certain distance from the ground. And although I'm not aware of a state that does this, it's not unthinkable that there would be something requiring that the license plate be horizontally centered on the rear of your vehicle.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, I live in Missouri and <a href=""http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C300-399/3010000130.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">our laws</a> say: </p>

<p><em>301.140. Each such plate shall be securely fastened to the motor vehicle or trailer in a manner so that all parts thereof shall be plainly visible and reasonably clean so that the reflective qualities thereof are not impaired. Each such plate may be encased in a transparent cover so long as the plate is plainly visible and its reflective qualities are not impaired. License plates shall be fastened to all motor vehicles except trucks, tractors, truck tractors or truck-tractors licensed in excess of twelve thousand pounds on the front and rear of such vehicles not less than eight nor more than forty-eight inches above the ground, with the letters and numbers thereon right side up.</em></p>

<p>Again, the exact wording of your laws will be different. You should really look them up.</p>

<p>You should also note that it is not just tow hitch racks that can obscure a license plate. Many trunk racks will also obscure the  plate if it is placed on the trunk and not the bumper.</p>

"Is standing up and pedaling on multi-gear bicycles a bad idea","5984","","<p>After reading  <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/7420/while-pedaling-standing-up-bike-crank-gives-in-as-if-shifting-what-is-causing"">While pedaling standing up, bike crank gives in as if shifting, what is causing this?</a> , I was thinking ""one should probably not be standing up to pedal under normal circumstances"". Is this an accurate assumption? </p>

<p>I remain seated while pedaling but I am not sure if it's right, or how to justify why one should not stand, other than it may be unsafe due to unpredictability in the drive train. </p>

<p>Instead I shift gears to make the bicycle easier to pedal so that I can remain seated at all times. </p>

<p>Should we <strong>remain seated</strong> at almost all times when on a multi-gear cycle? Why? </p>
","<p>As (almost) always, the great Sheldon Brown has covered this particular topic. <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/standing.html"">Standing while Cycling</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>To Sit or to Stand?</strong></p>
  
  <p>It is my belief that a great many cyclists stand up to pedal much more often than they should. I've often said:</p>
  
  <p>""If you find yourself standing to accelerate, on level ground, it is a sign that your gear is too high or that your saddle is too low.""
  Standing pedaling allows you to apply more force to the pedals than is possible seated, because you can rest your entire weight on the driven pedal, and, even more, by pulling up on the handlebar, you can push the pedal with more than your actual weight...but is this a good thing?
  Pedaling that hard is very stressful to the joints, and to the bicycle, and usually involves a level of effort that cannot be sustained aerobically. Unless you have unusually good form, it also tends to involve a fair amount of thrashing from side to side, which is a waste of energy. The added stress flexes many parts of the bicycle, and the energy required to do this flexing is not usually recovered when the parts straighten back out.</p>
  
  <p>These extreme stresses also greatly increase the risk of breaking things. If a pedal, crank, chain, handlebar or handlebar stem should break under this abnormal stress (a very real possibility) you are almost certain to suffer injury in the resulting crash. Even a simple missed shift or the skipping of a worn chain can toss you to the ground when you throw all of your weight onto a single pedal. You should never stand up to pedal a bicycle that you do not know to be in excellent mechanical condition!</p>

"Aerobars on a hybrid","5983","","<p>I got a set of aerobars for free and decided to install them on my hybrid.</p>

<p>1) I just tried them and feel a bit <strong>unstable</strong>. After checking it out online, I see this is normal, but I wonder if there is an optimal way to install them to reduce instability.</p>

<p>2) Does it <strong>make sense</strong> to install them <strong>on a hybrid</strong>? My hands do get numb during a long ride and I have always wanted to shift between positions.</p>

<p>3) While riding them, I feel more in control when my <strong>elbows are on my flat handlebars</strong> and thus not on the pads. Could this be because my seat isn't high enough (that's another problem altogether since my aluminum seatpost is corroded to my CrMo frame)?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XbcUL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>They are unstable because of how your weight shifts on the bike when you move to the aerobars. Hybrids are not really designed to have aerobars, the geometry doesn't really lend itself to that.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to get rid of the aerobars, and get handlebar extensions for the ends of the bars, much like you see on many mountain bikes. This will allow you to switch between different hand positions, while still keeping control and weight distribution where it should be.</p>

<p>Bike geometry- The main difference is in the seat tube and head tube angles. As you go from a hybrid (upright riding posture, slack seat tube angle) to a road bike (slightly more leaning forward, steeper seat tube angle) to a time trial frame (leaning on forearms, even steeper seat tubes), you progressively move the weight on the frame further forward.</p>

<p>There are also differences in how the bottom bracket is placed in relation to the ground/seat, etc. that are designed to produce a more comfortable ride.</p>

<p>As the weight shift forward happens, the handling of the bike is different. TT frames are notoriously poor handlers compared to road frames, and hybrids handle much different than a traditional road frame.</p>

<p>So when you move forward on the hybrid like you would for aerobars, you are moving the weight/center of gravity out of the ""sweet spot"" for the frame, and handling deteriorates as a result.</p>

<p>In addition to saving the trouble of getting the pin back in there, there's also the question of the integrity of modern outer chain links once they've had a pin pushed back through, even in the more normal circumstance of pushing a link halfway out for chain removal. Every current major manufacturer of derailer chains except KMC says not to do this, due to the risk of the fit not being as tight after re-insertion as it's supposed to be. I've long wondered whether there's actually anything different about KMC in this regard, but I know that modern chains in general are prone to breaking, usually during hard or fumbled front shifts, when they've been reconnected the ""traditional"" way. I wouldn't venture to guess what the odds are of it happening, probably quite low, but putting in another MissingLink eliminates the risk. They're very trouble-free.

"How to get a bike from one city to another in the U.S","5971","","<p>I need to mail a bike from Portland, Oregon to Austin, Texas. I know that you can get free bike boxes from many bike stores, but how do you pack a bike to ship by mail or to check as baggage on a plane?</p>
","<p>I've never shipped a bike, but I moved from Canada to Europe with my Surly Cross-check in a box last year. When the box came off the plane it looked like it had been run over by a truck and left out in the rain, but the contents of the box were 100% undamaged.</p>

<p>Hold on to your pants, this is gonna be long!</p>

<p>Shipping a bike is cheap and easy, <em>but make sure to do it right.</em> </p>

<p>As I'm sure you have found out airlines require you to have your bike in a box or a case. Cases are expensive. Most bikes are shipped to bike stores in a cardboard box in various stages of assembly from just a frame to a full bike with some parts removed for transport. When they unpack new bikes they have to get rid of the boxes so hopefully you can find a nice store that will give you one for free or sell you one really cheap, like 10 bucks or less.</p>

<p>If bike stores are no luck then furniture and appliance stores and bed stores like Sleep Country are great sources of large, strong, and free cardboard boxes and large strong plastic mattress bags, both of which you'll need. These stores are also usually overflowing with bubble wrap, styrofoam peanuts, little air filled plastic bags, and all sorts of other packing materials and are usually willing to give the stuff away if you want to root through the dumpster. Also recycling depots are always overloaded with cardboard, all free. Just think creatively and you should be able to find all the materials you will need for free in our mega-packaged and plasticized world.</p>

<p>So here's how (I think) you should pack your bike:</p>

<p><strong>Materials List</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Large strong cardboard box that will either fit your bike or can be easily cut and folded to make the right size box. Mattress boxes, fridge boxes, and large flat screen tv boxes are perfect. Just try to choose a box that is as long as your bike plus a couple of feet, and as tall as your bike plus a couple of feet, so you can have plenty of room to fold over the ends, top, and bottom. Just think of how you would size up a piece of wrapping paper before wrapping a present. I hope you are good at wrapping presents.</p></li>
<li><p>More flexible (but still corrugated) cardboard that you can roll like Xerox paper box type cardboard.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of newspaper, bubble wrap, styro-wrap... whatever you can scrounge for padding and space filler. Plastic shopping bags make great padding and can usually be had by the thousands from friends who would love to get rid of the bags of bags they have in their hall closets or kitchen drawers.</p></li>
<li><p>Several rolls of 2"" clear packing tape. Usually sold by the 6 pack pretty cheap or else sold per roll for the small price of an arm and leg at the UPS store, post offices, U-haul and other 'specialty' packing stores.</p></li>
<li><p>good box knife and/or good scissors</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Procedure</p>

<p><strong>Bike preparation:</strong></p>

<p>You have three options:
a) leave the wheels on the frame and make a box big enough for the whole bike, or 
b) remove the wheels and package them in a separate box, or
c) a combo of the two, which is what I did (remove front wheel, leave rear wheel on and pack it all in one box). </p>

<p>Check with the airline for fees per box and weight restrictions on the boxes to decide.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>remove pedals (and crank arms if you wish to package them separately but this isn't necessary IMO)</p></li>
<li><p>release the tension on your cables but leave them attached, so basically just crack the nut so the cable is for sure slack and then re-tighten gently to just hold the cable there. You mention this is a fixie so likely no shifter cables but maybe a brake cable, maybe not.</p></li>
<li><p>loosen stem and turn handlebars 90 degrees to they are parallel to your top tube. If you have drop bars or aero bars you may want to remove them all together, they can be placed inside the triangle of your frame when you pack the bike, but if you have any cables it is easier to leave them on the stem.</p></li>
<li><p>push seat post down into tube all the way but leave the seat on the bike, it is a good spacer against side impacts.</p></li>
<li><p>air down your tires but leave them spongy enough that you could just ride them. This will allow them to expand and contract during the flight but keep them seated on the rim during packing and transport</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Padding</strong></p>

<p>I am going to assume you are using one box but if you decide to ship the wheels separately then just don't put them back on the frame.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>remove wheels</p></li>
<li><p>using the more flexible cardboard cut a strip the width of your top tube and long enough to go around a couple of layers thick. Roll the cardboard around the tube firmly and tape in place, tabs are sufficient but you can wrap right around with the tape if you wish. Don't be stingy with the layers, put three layers if you want, make sure the cardboard goes right to the butt joints at either end.</p></li>
<li><p>repeat this process for the down tube, seat tube, stays and fork arms. Basically just cover all the long and delicate parts of your bike with a nice thick roll of cardboard. If you are putting your wheels back on the frame make sure you leave enough space so they can fit back on, depending on how thick your cardboard is maybe you'll only get one or two layers on the stays and forks.</p></li>
<li><p>do a similar wrap on your handlebars and cranks but use bubble wrap if you have some, or just a few sheets of newspaper. Hold in place with a tab of tape.</p></li>
<li><p>bubble or newspaper wrap other exposed sections of the bike if you wish such as brakes, stem, tube junctions</p></li>
<li><p>replace your wheels and tighten them on firmly. They should fit snugly between the cardboard padding.</p></li>
<li><p>if you managed to get a hold of a good solid plastic mattress bag (double or queen should do) then I would bag the bike and tape it shut. If for some unknown reason the box is left out in the rain or snow, or something in the luggage gets all over it you have an extra layer of protection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After this your bike should be pretty well padded, time to put it in a box or build a box around it.</p>

<p><strong>Boxing</strong></p>

<p>Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, stick and jab... oh right, cycling. This kind of depends on whether you have a bike or mattress box that is already close to the right size and whether you are leaving your wheels on or not. I will assume you are building a custom box and leaving the wheels on.</p>

<p><strong>IF YOU ARE TAKING YOUR WHEELS OFF, PUT A SPACER of some kind between your forks and stays where the axle would be to keep them from getting squished together if the box is compressed for some reason.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>ALSO - MAKE SURE YOU EITHER REMOVE AND/OR PUT A BLOCK, SPACER, OR SOME KIND OF PADDING around your rear derailleur (if you have one, fixie riders can ignore this bit), otherwise you risk having it broken or damaged by careless airline tossers.</strong></p>

<p>A block of wood like a piece of broomstick taped in place works fine, or perhaps you have (buy or scrounge from an old bike) a couple of solid axles that you can just pop into the dropouts, with one set of nuts inside the fork screwed out gently against the fork and the other on the outside screwed in gently against the fork, sandwiching the forks/stays in place.</p>

<p>Scenario 1 - you have a mattress box or bike box that is the right height and length and just need to drop the bike into it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>layer the bottom with a mass of firmly balled newspaper</p></li>
<li><p>lower the bike into the box</p></li>
<li><p>starting at the bottom pad around the wheels until the bike will free stand in the box. Firmly balled newspaper or bubble wrap is best.</p></li>
<li><p>once the bike is standing nicely you can begin to fill the rest of the space.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Styro peanuts, those air filled spacer bags, and bubble wrap are great for this. Loosely balled newspaper is excellent padding too. If your bike is in a clean(ish) plastic bag then extra clothing is good padding and space filler, and might cut down on the size of your checked luggage or carry on. Bulky items like jackets and pants for example. Or put your clothes in bags as well perhaps.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if you have removed the handlebars now is the time to place them in the triangular space and fill around them with packing.</p></li>
<li><p>bike parts that you have taken off such as pedals and cranks can be wrapped and places strategically in the empty spaces. Bike tools (to put it back together), tire pump, helmet, and other accessories can also be wrapped and used to fill the space.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When the box is full of packing to the top, close the top flaps and tape every single edge and seam closed. More on this later</p>

<p>Scenario 2 - you have a large box like a fridge box or mattress box that is way too big and you need to custom make a box.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>measure how wide your bike is at its wides point, usually the BB or handlebars</p></li>
<li><p>cut the box along one corner so that it can unfold and lay flat on the floor. Choose the largest side and lay the bike on its side on top of the box leaving enough room so that the top parts of your bike (seat and handlebars or stem) are below the top edge of the box by the WIDTH of your bike PLUS 4 inches. You are going to fold the top of the box over eventually and this much space will allow you to fold the top over completely making the box wide enough for your bike with 2 inches of space on either side of its widest point. Mark a line across the box at the level of your tallest part. This is where you will fold the box to make the top.</p></li>
<li><p>make similar measurements and mark lines on the box where you will make folds for the bottom, and then for the top again, cut off any excess cardboard. Don't worry about the length yet, you just want to wrap around the bike first.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Creasing and folding these large strong boxes can be difficult to do in a straight line. One way is to pick the box up on edge and use the corner of one of your walls as a straight edge. Stand the box up flat against one wall with the line against the corner and fold the box around the corner. This should give you a good fold and not take too much effort. If you have a big table or long counter top you could use that too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>make all your folds so that you have a box with open ends and an open top.</p></li>
<li><p>once the box is folded it should be easy to mark, cut and fold the end flaps and then tape them shut so that you can lower the bike into your new box.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend making all of your top flaps and end flaps the full width of the box. This makes each end a double layer of cardboard and also makes taping the edges together much easier because you can just butt the folds together and tape tightly. True, the sides and bottom are still a single layer but... meh.</p>

<p>So now you have made a box just the right size for your bike with the top flaps still open. Proceed as above under Scenario 1.</p>

<p><strong>A Note on Taping</strong></p>

<p>Here's how I tape closed a box that I want to be strong and secure for shipping.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>close your flaps and use tabs (4-6 inch long strips of tape) to firmly hold them together. For a bike sized box I would have at least 6 tabs on each end.</p></li>
<li><p>once an end is made, tape each corner along its length with two strips of tape, first off setting the tape slightly to one side, and then to the other. Lay the tape strip lengthwise along the edge and then fold it over, off set to the other side and repeat. This gives each corner a double layer of tape.</p></li>
<li><p>once the top is closed and the flaps are secured as I just described I would now tape right around the box 3 or four times. To go from top, down the side, under the bottom, up the other side, and across the top again. Three or four strips evenly spaced. Do the same from end to end 2 times as well.</p></li>
<li><p>if any of the seams or corners still seem weak at this point, tape the heck out of them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Labeling</strong></p>

<p>Check with the airline again regarding any restrictions (or requirements) on labeling but I put my name on the box in big black sharpie as well a safe 'return' address. At least if the bike got lost it would get back to my folks place and I could have it shipped again. If you know your destination address then put it on there too, kind of like you would address an envelope.</p>

<p>Add labels like 'This End Up' with arrows or 'Do Not Lay Flat' to keep the box upright so they won't lay it flat and pile stuff on top of it.</p>

<p>'Do Not Squish'
'Do Not Bend'
'Fragile'</p>

<p>may also be useful.</p>

<p>Well, that's all I can think of. If your bike gets damaged after packing it this securely then I think you will have a pretty good insurance case against the airline.</p>

<p>Oh and on that note get insurance on the bike for the trip, possibly through the airline, and take pictures of the bike during various stages of packing to prove your efforts and show that it's really yours.</p>

<p>Paranoid enough?</p>

<p>Good luck and Bon Voyage!</p>

<p>ps. If you're traveling with the bike, <strong>remember to pack the tools needed to put your bike back together.</strong></p>

<p>I resorted to digging it out with the small blade on my Swiss army knife. I know this is stupid for several reasons; that's why I'm asking if there's a better way. Is there some kind of weird pliers or something that's designed to make snapring removal a snap? Or is there a better way?</p>
","<p>The ends of the ring often taper, sometimes only one end does. That makes it slightly easier to get a screwdriver under the ring. But doing that often just pushes the ring around. Better to use a pair of pliers to spread the end, then a screwdriver to lift it. It will usually pop off, but the plier hand can usually block it from flying across the room.</p>

<p>I've commonly used the circlip pliers that force something open. They're reasonably well designed for the task although grinding the outer surfaces flat improves things. Even so, I often find that the job really requires three hands - for the pliers, a screwdriver and to catch the ring. Plus another to hold the wheel if you don't have an axle vise. AFAIK there is not easy way to do it - I've seen a number of mechanics who work on these a lot and all of them use either pliers or a screwdriver or both. Practice seems to make it faster rather than easier - they've all ended up chasing the ring around the cog at times.</p>

<p>Unless you have a spare pair of those pliers or work in a bike shop I think you're better off buying a proper small screwdriver than the pliers, because small screwdrivers have more uses.</p>

"Does cycling tighten your butt?","5949","","<p>I feel a little painful during the first few weeks of commute with bicycle. Just wondering that does it make my butt tighter and sexier?</p>
","<p>Since cycling is primarily based on leg strength, which is derived from all parts of the leg (including the glutes or butt muscles), then yes.</p>

<p>Here's a great graphic that shows some of the muscles used during a typical pedal stroke:

"Dealing with rust on a steel frame","5943","","<p>I have a small spot of rust on the bottom side of my steel frame's top tube (Columbus Niobium tubing).  It's from abrasion during transport that I didn't notice until it was too late.  The spot is about 2cm x 2cm and most the worn area is white in colour (base coat or primer?) but there's a bit of rust forming in the center.</p>

<p>I'm not ready to get the frame totally repainted so what's the best way to get this patched up?</p>
","<p>The best method for handling exterior frame rust depends on how much time you'd like to invest. The difference comes down to what you use to complete the two basic steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the rust
<ul>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Sandpaper - Cheap, but wont remove all the rust, and may leave debris.</li>
<li><strong>Better</strong>: Steel Wool - Will remove most of the rust, but may leave steel wool fragments, which can rust in turn.</li>
<li><strong>Best</strong>: Brass Wool - Since brass will not 'rust' (oxidize) like steel, any fragments left behind won't cause the frame to rust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cover up the spot
<ul>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Nail or auto polish - Not technically the best sealant, also will wear faster and will need to be re-applied.</li>
<li><strong>Better</strong>: Auto or spray paint, primer, or a clear lacquer - More water-tight, longer lasting.</li>
<li><strong>Best</strong>: Bicycle paint - This is a given. =]</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The most important point to note, though, is to <em>remove</em> as much of the rust as possible before painting. Simply painting over the rust will just seal it in, and allow it to continue rusting away beneath the layer of paint. </p>

"Metal or plastic levers?","5941","","<p>What are the advantages of buying plastic over metal tire levers? (or vice versa). </p>

<p>Which ones are easier to use? </p>
","<p>It largely depends on the usage you want to make of them and the particular tire/rim combination you use.</p>

<p>Plastic levers are usually small and lightweight, and if they are of good quality, they are enough for most tires that are properly fitted to the rim. I mention this because sometimes, rims and tires can physically differ from the nominal size they bear in their labels, so a tire may fit way too tightly in a rim. Other times, the wire collar in the bead may be too stiff. These two situations make them very hard to pry out, thus a tiny plastic lever may break, however, this is a rather rare case.</p>

<p>Small and light tire levers are ideal to carry in the emergency tool set for on the road or on the trail repairs. And for most cyclists that may now and then perform a tire swap at home.</p>

<p>Metal tire levers may be heavier or more expensive (due to being manufactured from fancy metals), and usually are bigger and better suited to shops where several tires are swapped or repaired by the same user each day. In this situation the large lever makes the work easier by providing (you guessed it) more leverage. They are also well suited for the situation described above, specially if for any reason you are forced to almost always use a tire that ""almost fits"".</p>

<p>Another reason to prefer plastic levers is that it is very difficult to damage a rim or a tire bead, while a poorly polished metal tire lever, or a poorly used one may easily damage the rim or the tire.</p>

<p>In the other hand, I would advise not using plastic levers that are too flexible or too thin and brittle.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there are also levers made of a metal core covered in plastic. They are kind of in the middle of both sides.</p>

<p><em>Note: I consider tire levers survival equipment, along with patches and glue and/or an extra tube, thus, if first time buying tire levers, or first time buying that brand/model, I strongly advise testing them at home before engaging on a long tour alone or you being the only one carrying emergency items like these, so you don't get stranded in a far place with a puncture and a pair of failed tire levers...</em></p>

"Is it legal to pass a car on the right when that car is turning?","5933","","<p>So I've been poring over the bikes SE, and as a recreational biker and an automobile commuter, I'm naturally most interested in topics addressing how bikes interact with automotive traffic.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/1774/3311"">one particular question</a> I noticed that it's legal in some jurisdictions for a biker to pass cars on the right at an intersection in order to move ahead of them.</p>

<p>This really surprised me, and it brought up a related question: is it legal to pass a car on the right when that car is making a right turn?? (In other words, a bike passing a car in such a way that if both maintain their intended path, they would collide.)</p>

<p>That may sound like a stupid question, but I have actually seen this twice in the last year. In one instance, I was the driver and I could see the bike approaching from behind at a distance. As I slowed to make my right turn, I glanced back at him and I could see that he was not slowing down. I slammed on the brakes and narrowly missed him as he whizzed by me on the right. I was in the right turn lane, he was originally directly behind me in the same lane, and there is no bike lane on that street.</p>

<p>In an earlier incident, I was walking my dog when I saw a car and bike collide under nearly identical circumstances. The biker was not injured badly but he did wipe out. I found myself sympathizing with the driver more than the biker. The driver was obviously not prepared for somebody to pass her on the right at 15MPH while she was making a right hand turn from the right lane.</p>

<p>Was his bike maneuver legal? Does the driver owe a biker that right of way? And if a driver hits a biker in this scenario, is the driver legally liable?</p>
","<p>Is it legal? That depends on the country's traffic laws and on the exact layout of the intersection. The traffic laws that I am familiar with (Denmark, Austria) indicate that the bicyclist you describe was wrong to overtake a right-turning car on the car's right side.</p>

<p><strong>If there is a bike lane that extends through the intersection,</strong> then AFAIK the cyclist always has right of way. The car must wait until it can turn without blocking any bikes.</p>

<p><strong>If there is a bike lane that stops before the intersection,</strong> or 
<strong>if there is no bike lane</strong> then the cyclist must place himself in the proper traffic lane. If he wants to go straight, he may not be in the right-turn lane. </p>

<p><strong>As a driver,</strong> what I usually do coming to a stop at an intersection is to place my car so close to the curb that no bikes can pass on that side. Safety benefits:<br>
If they want to go straight, they can safely overtake me on my left side.<br>
If they want to turn right too, they must line up behind me and turn after I have turned.</p>

<p><strong>As a cyclist,</strong> I <em>always</em> operate under the assumption that I am invisible, because too many drivers neglect to look for bicycle traffic. (They often neglect to check for <em>any</em> traffic, but that's irrelevant on this site.)</p>

"Measuring stem clamp / handlebar diameter","5890","","<p>I have a new-ish Bianchi Cortina hybrid that I'm trying to find suitable drop bars for, but I can't figure out the proper size to get. It seems like the bars mostly come in 25.4mm, 26mm and 31.8mm. But do you get this size from the bars, or from the stem clamp? </p>

<p>When I measure the bars on the outside of the clamp, it looks to be about 25.4. When I measure the space in the clamp itself it seems closer to 31.8. When I measure the bars directly under the clamp (where it fattens up a bit) it seems somewhere in between. Help?</p>
","<p>Measure the handlebar itself, while unmounted from the bike, at the center most point of the bar. Use a digital or vernier scale caliper. </p>

<p>The bar from the 2009 Bianchi Cortina is a 25.4mm MTB handlebar, with about 2 inches of rise. I expect yours will be as well. Do not use a 26mm bar, although you can likely mount it on the stem, because the installation will damage it, and it will fail, probably at some future point when you are riding it. </p>

<p>If you want a drop bar, you will need a new stem as well as handlebar. 25.4mm road drop bars are rare or non existent, since 25.4mm was the mountain bike standard. </p>

"Tools needed to perform groupset overhaul","5874","","<p>I'm looking at buying the new Shimano 105 5800 equipment for my bike. It is a 2010 Specialized Allez (Sport Triple) and still has its basic Sora components that it came with.

Looking online, Wiggle sells the groupset at ~€400, and Chainreactioncycles at ~€450. If I can equip myself with the right tools for significantly less than the €300 saving it makes sense for me to DIY.</p>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<p>What tools will I <strong>need</strong> to buy to be able to completely overhaul? </p>

<p>What other tools are <strong>recommended</strong> to make it easier? (e.g. cable crimpers are better than regular pliers..)</p>

<p>There are not many tools, and they are generally not that expensive.</p>

<p>With all the resources out there (youtube, sheldon brown website, etc) and basic mechanical aptitude it isn't a difficult task.</p>

<p>In terms of specific tools for those components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bottom Bracket (BB)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Pressfit:
   <strong>A BB press, a BB punch/remover.</strong></p>
  
  <p>If Threaded: <strong>A BB Wrench</strong></p>

<li>Cassette : <strong>Chain Whip, Cassette lockring socket tool.</strong>  </li>
<li>Chain : <strong>Chain breaker, Chain tool or missing link pliers depending on chain</strong></li>
<li>Brakes</li>
<li>Crankset : <strong>Pedal wrench or allen keys depending on the pedals.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modern Shimano specific (like the 105 group): <strong>Hollowtech II crank arm installation tool</strong></li>
  <li>Front derailleur</li>
  <li>Rear derailleur </li>
  <li>STI levers (Shifters/Brakes)</li>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Or what should I be searching for here?</p>
","<p>Since it sounds like you have mechanical disc brakes (Avid BB5 or Tektro Novela not hydraulic) then any direct-pull or V-Brake lever should work fine with your cable. Searching for 'V-Brake levers' or 'mechanical disc brake levers' should provide plenty of responses.</p>

<p>For example, if you look at the <a href=""http://www.sram.com/avid/products/fr-5-lever"" rel=""nofollow"">spec page for the Avid FR-5 lever</a>, you will see that they are compatible with both ""Mechanical disc brakes, Linear-pull brakes."" V-Brakes are a type of linear-pull brakes.</p>

<p>Note that most levers designed specifically for Cantilever Brakes will NOT be compatible. The key issue is that the levers must be direct or linear pull.  Some brake levers (e.g. Shimano's ST-EF60 shifter+brake lever combo) are switchable between canti's and V-brakes.

<p>It seems that first step is to find a frame. What kind of frame should I get? How do I understand that a frame is compatible and good? When buying a second hand frame, what should I look for? (most common stress points to check, or similar...) </p>
","<p>Starting with a second hand frame and scrounging second hand parts for it is definitely the way to go if youŕe trying to save money. Many cities have some kind of bicycle recycling group in them, but it can be hard to track them down. They will be able to help you a lot and will save you both money and time. Asking around bike shops and checking their notice boards or any posters they have up is the most likely way in my experience. If you have to start by collecting bikes from the rubbish dump itś going to be a long, hard process.</p>

<p>If you want to buy a new frame and put new parts on it that will cost more than a similar bike bought ready-made. You're buying parts one at a time retail, the assembly plant buys them by the containerload, or from a nearby factory. In Australia you can get a new fixie from a bike shop from about $400, and one that's ridable from about $600. A cheap frame by itself will cost at least $250, and a pair of wheels another $150. This is partly because people wanting to build their own are rarely after cheap stuff, and partly because no retailer sells enough parts to get the volume discounts that assemblers do. I have a friend who manufactures custom bikes, and he gets shipments of 200 wheels for less than half the wholesale price of a single wheel sourced locally (so less than 1/4 of the retail price).</p>

<p>I suggest sitting down and doing a rough budget based on buying parts from a single online retailer. It doesn't matter that you will miss a few of the small parts, since the total cost is likely to be alarming. And you haven't even added in the cost of reselling parts that don't fit and buying replacements.</p>

<p>At the very least I suggest you will need to visit a bike shop for fitting the <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/2759#2759"">bottom bracket</a> (the thread-chasing tool is expensive, and you may need to try several bottom brackets to get your chain alignment correct).

Depending how he goes, I'll try a standard right crank and a short left crank. If all else fails, we will go for the Power Cranks </p>

<p>UPDATE: In case anyone else has similar problems.
Got some 152mm cranks for $30. Set an old  mountain bike up with the seat as far back as possible. The old man is able to ride reasonably comfortably, now has a smile from ear to ear - any suggestions how to remove it - doesn't fit with the grumpy old man image :) </p>

<p>Has got me wondering how many people with minor knee problems would benefit from short(er) cranks....... </p>
","<p>Look at <a href=""http://www.powercranks.com/"">Power Cranks.</a>  They are a crank set with the ability to freewheel independently of each other.</p>

<p>It allows a slow build to fully articulated movement if additional rehab is still a goal, and using each crank independently means using a bike is still possible, even if doing so uses a pedaling motion which would be awkward for someone who had an option for full movement.</p>

<p>They also have adjustable crank lengths on each independent arm, which would allow you to use a shorter crank on the leg with the limited movement.</p>

<p>They are often used as a rehab tool, are a real, readily available, and not ridiculously priced product, and are install-able with normal bicycle tools. </p>

<p>One caveat: They are shifting to a new poly carbonate fixing cap. If you order, I recommend requesting the old alloy fixing caps. The last set of poly caps I installed broke easily.</p>

<p>FTR, I have installed and used this product, and have no relationship with the manufacturer, nor will I be compensated in any way for this post.</p>

"How do you spot the left side pedal on egg beater pedals?","5837","","<p>I've just got a new set of crank brothers egg beater pedals and I can't tell which pedal is for the left side, and which is for the right just from looking at them.

<blockquote>
  <p>Eggbeater pedals have either a 6mm Hex, an 8mm Hex, and/or 15mm wrench flats.  Note that <strong><em>the right pedal has a 
  standard right-handed thread and the left pedal has a left-handed thread</em></strong>.  For identification, left pedal has a small 
  “L” on the spindle or a small groove around the spindle flange.  The right pedal has a small ""R"" stamped in the 
  spindle or no special markings.</p>

"Can I put bullhorn bars on a bike with hydraulic disc brakes","5805","","<p>The most comfortable bike I've ever owned was a road bike with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_handlebar#Pursuit"">bullhorn</a> (aka pursuit) bars. I actually had a pair of STI levers on it, mounted upside down (with the handles pointing forward). They looked kinda scary, but they were really good that way - I found it was much easier to use the levers that way than on normal road bars.</p>

<p>I've since moved on to a flat-bar road bike with hydraulic disc brakes. So my question is - is there any way of getting bullhorn bars going with the current setup - ie hydraulic levers and mountain bike style gear changers. I could conceivably turn the brake levers upside down again and then get bar end shifters for the gears. Would that work?</p>

<p>Or is there an off-the-shelf solution?</p>
","<p>Your options are fairly limited, nearly all bullhorn bars are sized for 23.8mm road brake levers, while mountain levers are sized for 22.2mm handlebars.  There do appear to be some 22.2mm bullhorn bars listed on eBay currently, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>You may also have luck finding some 22.2mm ""north road"" style bars that you can flip over or trekking bars with close to the right shape that you can cut down. Alternatively, a set of hydraulic brakes with suitably modifiable clamps.</p>

<p>As far as better levers than just using your mountain levers, it's expected that drop-bar hydraulic levers are coming in the not-too-distant future due to disc brakes' recent legalization in UCI cyclocross.  In the interim there are some pretty ugly hacks, basically involving running a set of cables from a cabled brake to an interim hydraulic lever.

"Keeping a leather saddle in good condition","5805","","<p>Is shoe polish a good or at least adequate solution for keeping a leather saddle in good condition? And/or better options?</p>
","<p>I guess shoe polish (the creamy one, not fancier new ones with sylicone and lots of synthetic polymers) at least won't do any harm, but maybe there are better choices.</p>

<p>Manufacturers advise the use of specific products (Brooks Proofide, for example) both for treating the surface against wear and tear induced by friction and the elements, but also for treating the deep layers of the saddle thickness, improving its mechanical characteristics, specially when new and yet uncomfortable, but also after some use and possibly abuse (mainly due to weather).</p>

<p>Leather tanning actually takes the subcutanous connective layer of cattle skin, which is rich in collagen, and treats it so that it can last longer. As such (at least it seems so to me) they have a ""natural"" affinity for natural substances, specially the lipo-soluble molecules found, for example, in Proofide itself: tallow, beeswax, cod oil, etc.</p>

<p>I like to look at my Brooks as if it was a somewhat living friend: we have a friendship, I treat it nicely and it responds by treating me nice. Even caressing it and silently talking to it is fine (at least is makes ME feel fine).</p>

<p>So with the Proofide I like to think I am giving something it likes: those fatty, variated, long-chain, apolar, gracefully degrading organic molecules, and not the inorganic, synthetic, industrialized, unlively plastified synthetic products one might choose as an alternative.</p>

<p>(and by the way, the thinnest layer once in a while is more than enough: that tiny can of Proofide will last for many years!)</p>

"Is it safe to ride a steel bike with a dented/buckled frame?","5754","","<p>I just noticed, to my great sadness, a small-ish buckle/dent in my diagonal lower tube. (I'm riding a <a href=""http://www.99bikes.com.au/bike-cooper-t200-championship-50-ss-52cm-black"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cooper T200 single speed</a>.) I just moved house; I hope I didn't do it. I probably did.</p>

<p>It's about half way up and looks like it's been bent against something, or crushed between something - the tube itself is still straight, it just has a bit of a ding. It's probably only dented in a fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>A fraction of an inch is no longer a perfect circle, though, and it'll inevitably weaken it. Question is, enough for me to worry about? Or should I just keep riding and forget it?</p>

<p>I ride on roads, to work, nothing strenuous, but want to be able to hit the occasional pothole or what have you without constantly thinking that my frame is going to collapse under me.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any <em>actual experience</em> with this sort of ""injury""? Any suggestions how I might fix it, short of replacing the tube? I don't care if it looks a bit rough, we're through the honeymoon period, it's just a functional machine now. :-)</p>

","<p>All steel frames of any age get a few dings from serious use.</p>

<p>The failure point for steel frames is usually the highest stress points: the joins. That is why we used to have fancy tubing sets likes Reynolds 351 double butted, and I notice that your frame does too.</p>

<p>So, if the dent is away from the joins I say the frame is ok for general use. Steel is quite a forgiving material, but I wouldn't be doing bunny hops on it :-)</p>

<p>If the dent is within 25% of the tube length, but more than 10cm (4 in) from a join, then I would be using it, but cautiously. If it's closer than 10cm from a join then I would get a shop to look at it.</p>

<p>I would add that I've ridden high-end bikes for <em>decades</em> after their first (heart breaking) dents. One of them has just died, but a fork failed (at the join), not the dented frame.</p>

","<p>I think your last comment is the operative point - it will happen anyway sooner or later.</p>

<p>The technology here is basically the same as with automobiles. You start off with new pads and a clean rotor. The bedding in process involves the deposit a small layer of pad onto the rotor (mixed in with a little frictional heat).</p>

<p>Until you have that layer on the rotor, braking could be less powerful and uneven.</p>

<p>You don't ask this, but for completeness, the rotor should be cleaned whenever the pads are changed, using isopropyl alcohol. And, once the rotor is clean, the bedding-in process will start over.</p>

"What kind of tires I can use with tubeless rims?","5740","","<p>I bought a Trek FX 7.4 last summer, and now, as the conditions are getting more and more slippery, I'm thinking of getting a bit more winter-y tires. The rims are tubeless, but I'm a bit confused of what kind of tires I can buy. Are all tires compatible with these tubeless rims? Do I need to fit an inner tube with some tires, or do all tires work ""tubeless""?</p>
","<p>The rims spec'd with a lot of new Trek bikes (including yours) are ""Tubeless ready"". This means that you can run tubeless, but you can also run regular old tires with tubes (i.e. clinchers). </p>

<p>The primary advantage of running a tubeless tire (which will be marked as tubeless) is that you can run a lower pressure without getting pinch flats, which is advantageous in the winter. However, you have to faff about with sealant (and the right valves, rim strips) to get this done [along with obviously buying the tubeless tire]. Note that if the seal fails, you should be carrying an inner tube (regardless of running a regular or tubeless tire) so you can throw it into the tire to get you home. </p>

<p>If you run a regular tire (i.e. a clincher -- tubular tires are a specialty item for track racers, so don't get the terms confused), you should an inner tube in and install as normal. If you're running the tires that shipped with the 7.4 FX originally, you have a regular tire (which has a tube), so you just find another tire which is about the same size (probably something around 700x32), pop off the old one and pop on a new one. Regular tires are also a bit cheaper. </p>

<p>There are people who run regular tires as tubeless (at their own risk - <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/24032/homemade-tubeless-tires"">some tires take this, others don't</a>). You can try this at your own risk, but for winter, I'd probably just go for a regular clincher tire with inner tube. The tires you can fit onto something like a 7.4 FX will be narrow enough that the lower pressure advantage of a tubeless tire will not really help you. Maybe a regular studded tire depending on where you are and what your road conditions are like. </p>

"How do I calculate spoke length?","5739","","<p>I have lots of bikes and lots of interesting wheel sizes, I would like to know how to calculate the right spoke lengths for a wheel.</p>

<p>I appreciate that there are probably rather a lot of variables but this is something that has been an issue for me from time to time so being able to work out the right spoke length for an arbitrary wheel (did I mention that I have half a dozen or more different wheel sizes in the garage?) would be useful.</p>

<p>To be clear - I don't want a calculator, I want to know what the sums are.</p>
","<p>The basic arrangement for cross-laced spokes is thus:</p>

<pre><code>Spoke Length = sqrt[ (RRSP - (HSR * cos(SAA)))^2 + HFO^2 - (HSR * cos(SAA))^2 ]
</code></pre>

<p>For radial (straight) spokes, the formula is simpler:</p>

<pre><code>Spoke Length = sqrt[ (RRSP - HSR)^2 + HFO^2 ]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>RRSP</strong> (Rim Radius plus Spoke Penetration) is half of the Effective Rim Diameter given by the manufacturer plus 2mm for the spoke's penetration into the nipple</li>
<li><strong>HSR</strong> (Hub Spoke Radius) is the radius from the hub center to the outermost edge of the spoke holes on the hub</li>
<li><strong>SAA</strong> (Spoke Anchor Angle) is the angle of from the hub spoke hole to rim hole that the spoke goes to.  It depends upon the lacing pattern and which individual spoke you are calculating for.</li>
<li><strong>HFO</strong> (Hub Flange Offset) is the distance from the hub's flange to the lateral center of the wheel, based upon the dish of the wheel.  For a front wheel, this will be the same on each side, but for a rear wheel, which has a dish to accommodate the rear gears, this is different for each side since the hub's own lateral center is different from the wheel's lateral center.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll credit <a href=""http://spokeanwheel.110mb.com/"">this page</a> for the formula; it also has more detail.</p>

<p>There are also a bunch of calculators online, the easiest of which is probably <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard/spocalc.htm"">Damon Rinard's spocalc spreadsheet</a>.  Other calculators:</p>

"practical pro and contra for Nuvinci CVT especially for hilly terrain","5730","","<p>I'm thinking of buying new bike <em>next</em> year, most probably combo for exercise &amp; commuting in summer. Since terrain is relatively hilly here and both fixed city-bike and casual combo with 3x7 gears making me too much tired, I thought of buying as additional item NuVinci Mondo hub. Reviews are mostly positive but I'd like to read real pro and contra, not paid-by-manufacturer-or-reseller review. Do I win anything real for that price? Or is this just money waste? What are maintenance costs and issues?</p>
","<p>The NuVinci system is fantastic in principle and one day all bikes might come with it, but we aren't there yet. As the system stands there are a few matters that might not make it the answer to your prayers of an easier time going up hills:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For hilly terrain you need gears - it goes without saying. The steeper the hills the bigger range of gears - going up you may need a 'granny gear' and going down the hill you need a big gear (unless you don't like speed and coast).<br>
This is the potential problem area with your intended application. The NuVinci hub has a range of 350% - exactly what that relates to depends on your spocket/chainring choice. Meanwhile, with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_gearing#Gearing_range"">a Rohlhoff or basic derailleur setup you are going to get a range of around 530%</a>. Touring bikes and XC-MTB's usually come with an even greater range, however, do you use the 'granny ring'?<br>
Note that early adopters of the NuVinci hub seem to be primarily in Denmark and the Netherlands, where the terrain is flatter than the North Sea. </p></li>
<li><p>There is also the small matter of efficiency. With a derailleur gear setup you can get an amazing 98% efficiency when on the middle ring and middle sprocket, marginally less for other 'sensible' gear combinations, even if you have not 'lubed' in a while. (The problem with studies on this is that they also include 'silly' gear combinations such as small sprocket and small chainring where the hideous chainline makes for an inefficient system, giving a wider efficiency range than is realistic). No hub gear system can improve on derailleur efficiency levels and the NuVinci FAQ side-steps giving any useful figures, preferring to make comparisons with existing hub gear systems, for which 92% is roughly ball-park. Personally I could contend with that on rides through town where gears are for getting up to speed but not for sustained hill climbing where 5% loss would mean 5% slower.</p></li>
<li><p>Weight is another area where the derailleur rules supreme. At the moment the NuVinci hub is relatively heavy - I think the latest systems are 1.5Kg heavier than an average derailleur setup. In my opinion weight really does matter on hills in a way that it does not if riding on the flat. I frequently pick up 2 litres of milk at the bottom of the hill where I live and it does make an appreciable, albeit not show-stopping difference to how I attack the hill.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable range gears. Personally I have no problem shifting gears on a 9 speed sprocket, thanks to the wonders of 'Hyperglide'. I also find that there are enough of them and I have no need for gears in between the gears that I have. For me an infinite amount of gears sounds good, but in practice I think the 'need' is over-hyped. I don't find myself changing up/down to find myself spinning furiously or plunging away completely out of sensible cadence. However, I can see how the NuVinci would help those that don't change gears that cleanly, i.e. not anticipating the need for the middle ring at the base of a hill.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintenance. Not a lot is needed for the NuVinci system because it is a hub gear. If you are running bullet proof tyres you won't even need to get the wheel out for punctures. However, if you did have a problem and needed to take it to the shop then they would be stumped.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, you will have extra weight, lower efficiency and a reduced range of gears. Despite the benefits of CVT with smoother shifting, reduced maintenance and not having to match your cadence to available gears, you are not going to get round the fundamentals of weight/efficiency/range.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that you try an electric assist bike such as one of the models made by Giant. Although they weigh a lot they are amazingly nimble and you can pedal as much as you want to on one.</p>

<p>I hardly ride bicycles. I've gone night cycling for 5+ hours before (not sure what distance that translates to) and I don't remember it being especially difficult except that it was pretty uncomfortable for my butt, and I've read that people actually do travel 20km to work daily, so distance itself shouldn't be a problem right? And feasibly how long would it take to bike that distance for the commuter-level people?</p>

<p>However,</p>

<ol>
<li>I live in Singapore, so it's extremely hot and humid. I'm not sure if this is pertinent at all but I'm wondering if it makes cycling long distances unbearable</li>
<li>Although we have bicycle roads scattered around the country, it isn't a cyclist-friendly place. I'm aware drivers here detest it when cyclists cycle on the road, and to add to that I'm not confident about cycling on the road either. I'd much rather cycle on the pedestrian path but I heard it's rude to, or is it okay as long as you maintain a respectful speed and not get in the way of pedestrians?</li>
<li>Since each commute is around 20km, if I'm not wrong a road bike would be better, but I'm more inclined towards city/cruiser bikes because of their appearance. This may seem like a bad reason but if it's only going to be a bit more uncomfortable then I'm willing to suffer that. Will Creme or Linus bicycles suffice? Like Creme's Molly series. If they're not good enough, are there any decent road bikes that look like that?</li>
<li>Bike theft here is common enough for it to be a concern for me. Since I'm probably going to be leaving my bike unattended for several hours (may be up to half a day), if I use hardened steel bike locks and U-locks will my bike be safe? I'll be parking it in my university but I'm not sure if that is going to deter bike thieves at all. From what I've read online bicycles are stolen so much it almost sounds inevitable, and I <em>really</em> don't want to experience that. Also, handcuffs are illegal in my country so the Master Lock street cuffs probably are too- are there single cuffs for the bike wheels and are they reliable? They seem pretty sturdy to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just in case anyone wants to know, I'm considering a bike because travelling the same 20km by public transport takes 1.5h and requires me changing buses/trains several times, which is too much hassle.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I have been riding to work for about 20 years now and my round trip distances have ranged from 35-75 km (50 km currently). It will be difficult to jump into riding 40 km every day, 5 days a week if you have little riding experience.  Fatigue can quickly accumulate depending on how hard you ride each day.  Instead, I would suggest starting with just a few days a week and work you way up.  You will also need to plan for recovery weeks in order to keep feeling your best.</p>

That said, a comment within that article suggested otherwise.  Perhaps it would be worth asking this as a single question on stack exchange.</p>

<p>Some other interesting tidbits from the <a href=""https://www.ntu.edu.sg/ohs/safetyforeveryone/Documents/Singapore%20Laws%20on%20Cycling.pdf"">laws governing cycling in Singapore</a> </p>

<ul>
<li>Your load cannot exceed 18 kg.  

<ul>
<li>(Good thing most textbooks are digital now, I would have been in trouble during my undergrad.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You must use a bike path if one exists.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Since each commute is around 20km, if I'm not wrong a road bike would be better, but I'm more inclined towards city/cruiser bikes
  because of their appearance. This may seem like a bad reason but if
  it's only going to be a bit more uncomfortable then I'm willing to
  suffer that. Will Creme or Linus bicycles suffice? Like Creme's Molly
  series. If they're not good enough, are there any decent road bikes
  that look like that?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you will be spending a lot of time riding, getting a comfortable fit should be your top priority.  Fit is also a very difficult subject in cycling as there is no such thing as the perfect fit, only a balance of compromises. I personally find being too upright uncomfortable (it places all your load on your sit bones), but also feel that many road bikes are too low.  20 years in I am still working to improve my fit.  Before you write off all road bikes, look at the ""endurance"" type road/touring bikes.  These will have a taller frame stack (vertical distance from the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube) than the ""race"" road bikes and will be much more comfortable for most rides while still rolling efficiently. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>Bike theft here is common enough for it to be a concern for me. Since I'm probably going to be leaving my bike unattended for several
  hours (may be up to half a day), if I use hardened steel bike locks
  and U-locks will my bike be safe? I'll be parking it in my university
  but I'm not sure if that is going to deter bike thieves at all. From
  what I've read online bicycles are stolen so much it almost sounds
  inevitable, and I really don't want to experience that. Also,
  handcuffs are illegal in my country so the Master Lock street cuffs
  probably are too- are there single cuffs for the bike wheels and are
  they reliable? They seem pretty sturdy to me.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No lock is theft proof. With the right tools any lock can be defeated. That said, some locks are a much better deterrent than others, plus you can mitigate your risk by carefully selecting <em>where</em> you lock your bike, as well as the general appearance of your bike (less flashy, means less of a target).  I remember people at university spray painting their bikes all sorts of horrible colours to deter theft.  I personally just found some places that had high visibility with lots of people. Of course, like any advice your mileage may vary.</p>

"Why does my bike stick in low gears?","5700","","<p>When I change into a low gear (i.e. onto a bigger cog) on my back cog all is fine. However, when I later change up again the chain sticks on the larger cog. I commute about 10 miles a day and this has been happening now for about 3 days. It usually rectifies itself after a period of frantic pedalling. I'm riding a fairly old (2004ish) Specialized Rock Hopper (in good nick) with road tyres.<br>
My thoughts are that this is being caused by either the gear cable sticking somewhere or by a problem in the derailleur.<br>
Any tips on how to diagnose where the problem lies? I guess I could just get a new cable and see if this fixes it.<br>
Thanks!</p>
","<p>What is happening is that you have enough force in your hand to move the whole mechanism towards one direction overcoming the failure point, but the spring in the derailleur doesn't have the required force. As you pedal (and ride) vibration helps momentarily reducing friction and allowing the spring to pull back, so it finally shifts.</p>

<p>The most common cause of this issue is rust between the cable and the cable housing. There are also a few other closely related: </p>

<ul>
<li>Dirt can accumulate inside the cable housing.</li>
<li>The lubricant used on the cable (if any) gets clogged or dries up, also catching dirt.</li>
<li>The lining of the cable housing or inner of the housing itself has
degraded due to wear.</li>
<li>The cable is deformed or frayed inside the housing.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the previous are cable related and can be easily diagnosed by disassembling the cable, pulling it out of the housing and visually check the cable. It should look even, without rust and without any permanent sharp bends, i.e. if left hanging it should hang straight or barely and smoothly curved. Also you should be able to pull and push cable in and out of the housing wit almost zero effort (no ""perceptible"" friction).</p>

<p>The easy way to fix is to replace the cable and the housing. If this is not an option you can clean the cable, try to unbend it, lubricate and reassembly. Frayed cable can be reused by removing the hole strand of wire up to the head of the cable. The cable can survive with one or two strands out. But all these are temporary remedies only, you will quickly observe the symptoms again, specially with frayed cable, chances are it will fray more. Very old cable or too rusted is better not to attempt any of these solutions as they wont last enough to be worthy.</p>

<p>Also remember to clean the housing internally. This can be achieved pouring rust remover or fine oil inside the housing and hope it will get out by the other end dragging the dirt and debris out. This can be messy and time consuming.  If you can blow through it with an air compressor, it may help if the problem is just trapped dirt.</p>

<p>But then again, these are temporary solutions,as most of the time, the housing will be damaged on the inside, due to wear, and this causes rough spots that easily trap more dirt or simply cause friction, so the whole system wont perform as good as with simple brand new cable.</p>

<p>A badly installed cable can also be the cause. Check the hole travel of the cable looking for sharp turns, or the cable being pulled against parts of the frame or components or accessories where it is not supposed to.</p>

<p>If all the previous is verified and corrected as needed but the problem persists, the derailleur itself must be checked. Here the most common causes can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too much dirt trapped among derailleur's linkages</li>
<li>The derailleur is badly bent or otherwise has lost its shape.</li>
<li>There is rust in the pivots</li>
<li>weakened spring due to rust, deformation or excessive wear, or even misplaced spring</li>
</ul>

<p>All these can be diagnosed for sure with close and careful visual inspection under good light. Nevertheless to be sure you can disconnect the cable, remove the chain and carefully move the derailleur along its designed travel. You should feel clear resistance from the spring and the mechanism should quickly return on itself when you release it. If it presents lag in the return, re-check the above.</p>

<p>The obvious solutions are clean the derailleur and lubricate it's pivots. In case of a misplaced spring, it can be relocated using long fine nose pliers, just be careful. If the spring is too damaged, maybe is better to change the derailleur or try to find a spare spring somewhere, if it's free, better.</p>

<p>If the derailleur is bend or otherwise deformed, you better get another one. Almost only steel ones can be rectified but it is rather difficult and time consuming, it's not worthy most of the time since steel derailleurs tend to be cheap.</p>

<p>Do not forget to inspect and test the shifter lever. The easy way is to disconnect the cable from the derailleur and while gently pulling it outwards the housing, actuate the lever back and forth. The cable should move accordingly. If the shifter is the indexed type, the cable movement should be crisp and without lag. Generally, the lever just needs some lubrication. I do not recommend dis assembly of indexed shifter levers as many are rather complex.</p>

<p>When you finish reassembling the system most sure you'll need to adjust derailleur properly. Sure you'll find lots of methods/tutorials in the cloud or in other questions posted on this site.</p>

<p>If any of the above help you diagnose the problem better take your bike to a local shop.</p>

"How do you distinguish a touring bike from a speed/road bike?","5681","","<p>I would like to buy a touring bike soon, but in our country I cannot find any <a href=""http://www.biketoledo.net/pages/top10tourbikes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">well known touring bike</a>. I would like to buy a used one so I am going to visit some of the bicycles stores of our capital city. I am afraid I do not know how to recognize a touring bike.</p>

<p>What are the differences between a touring and a speed/road bike (e.g. eyelets on the folk)? Unfortunately I have not had enough experience to classify them based on the frame geometry but if you can tell me any tips I will thank you. :)</p>
","<p>Any bike can be used for touring long distances. The main question is, what type of touring do you want to do? </p>

<p>If you want to do self-supported touring (you carry the luggage yourself on the bike vs. a car transports the stuff for the whole group), you need a bike that can <strong>take luggage</strong>. The other main feature I look for in a touring bike is <strong>comfort</strong>, because I spend a lot of time on the bike, 3-5 hours a day, day after day.</p>

<p>Most mountainbikes, citybikes, trekking bikes, comfort bikes can be retrofitted with racks/carriers to hold panniers. Usually the rear-carrier is easy to do, the front carrier might be tricky, but there are front carriers even for suspension forks (see Old Man Mountain front racks).</p>

<p><strong>CHAINSTAY</strong>
For me, the most important feature of a specifically long-distance touring bike is the frame geometry. And in frame geometry, for me in a touring bike, the most important is the chainstay. A long-distance touring bike has a minimum of <strong>45 cm</strong> chainstay (vs. 40-41 cm), but touring specific manufactures do longer ones (Rose bikes: 46 cm, IDworx: 47.1 cm). This is to give space for rear panniers, and usually the same for all frame sizes. If your feet hit the rear panniers, you cannot go. I had this problem, and it really is a problem, and difficult to fix. After checking some bikes, you will be able to tell visually how long the chainstay is (big distance between rear wheels and seatpost). To be very precise, you can measure the actual chainstay (the horizontal distance).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WxrV8.jpg"" alt=""Chainstay length""></p>

<p><strong>WHEELBASE</strong> Another helpful feature is a long wheelbase, which is size dependent, but usually <strong>105 cm</strong> and up. This is helpful for the slower, in line motion of touring (vs. fast turning in a group of bikes in a competition).</p>

<p>The rest, you can upgrade, or live with. My wife and I, we tour a lot. She has a 7 speed (hub gear) city bike with a rubbish rear roller brake (not to confuse with a disk brake). I have a 8 speed (hub gear) city bike-mountain bike hybrid. We bought some panniers, and there we go. On steep hills, we get off and push the bikes. I did 3000 km in the last year, and we've just been in Slovenia on a few hundred KM tour, last year we've been at the Dolomiti in Italy. We complained a lot about the 7 and 8 gears, but it didn't stop us from touring.</p>

<p><strong>Some myths that I think you should NOT consider:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>""Steel frame is easy to fix when broken""</strong>. These days all frames are of good quality. If your frame is broken, you will order anyway a new frame, because a welded-repaired steel frame is no use at all. I have one bike with a steel frame, after an accident the frame got bent, and the bike doesn't really keep a straight line. It's not possible to get it back to the original condition.</li>
<li><strong>""Easy of repair""</strong> in general. If you tour in Europe, for a few days, you will always find a repair shop, and if you need special parts, you can always order by mail in 1-2 days. Bar end shifters are easy to repair, and this was a must 20-30 years ago, today is less of a concern. If your wheel is destroyed, or your tyre falls apart, you will order anyway a quality wheel/tyre, and not fiddle with a third world low quality tyre. If you look around the web, people do around the World tours with disc brakes, carbon drive, and other fancy stuff, and if they break down in the middle of Africa, they get the parts by mail order in 1-2 days, and continue.</li>
<li><strong>Kona Sutra, Surely LHT, Trek 520 are the best</strong> Many websites are written in English, and are maintained by US, UK tourers, and list brands from these countries. However, bike touring in The Netherlands, and in Germany is a much bigger thing then in any other country. They have lots of brands, even premium ones, only for touring. See for example IDWorx, Koga in the Netherlands, or Rose Bikes, Tout Terrain in Germany. They have a <em>long</em> list of different touring bikes. In Amsterdam there is a bike shop only for touring bikes (<a href=""http://www.vakantiefietser.nl"">De Vakantiefietser</a>). Only touring bikes!</li>
<li><strong>Some very special bike is needed.</strong> When I started, I talked and asked a lot about the bikes. The more I go on touring, the less I care about the bike, and focus on the trip.</li>
</ol>

<p>By my experience, the most helpful thing about the bike on a bike tour are puncture proof tyres, because it saves a lot of time for relatively smaller investment. Schwalbe Marathon tyres are like that. Any bike you buy for touring, I recommend to change the tyres to Schwalbe Marathon (or any other Schwalbe that is puncture proof), this will save you a lot of time when on a trip.
I suggest to buy the widest tyres your bike can take, for added comfort.</p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong> my recommendation is</p>

<ul>
<li>to check for a 45 cm (or more) chainstay to fit panniers easily.</li>
<li>Schwalbe Marathon tyres to avoid punctures.</li>
<li>The rest, you can change, upgrade, make the bike comfortable for <em>yourself</em> within the your budget.</li>
</ul>

"Are road bike seats interchangeable?","5680","","<p>I am a beginner to riding on road bikes.  A friend has lent me his road bike (Giant) for about 1 month and I want to use it as much as possible before I think about buying my own.  The current seat is absolutely killing me though (I have padded bike shorts already) so I'm thinking of fitting it with a seat more suited for me.  </p>

<p>If I get a new seat, is it likely that I will be able to use it on another bike?</p>
","<p>Almost all saddles will be exchangeable -- there are a few rare (and very expensive ones) you wouldn't encounter unless you were looking for them which can't be exchanged. </p>

<p>So yes, almost surely if you buy a new saddle you can use it on another bike. </p>

<p>Note that some saddles are marketed as ""road"" or ""mtb"" - the mtb ones are possibly more durable, but this is a marketing distinction -- they are not separate standards. </p>

<p>That being said, there are a few things to note in your question:</p>

<p>1) Some discomfort when starting to ride road bikes is normal - the saddles are often harder than what most people are used to, so they need to get used to using their sit bones.</p>

<p>2) Some seatposts don't have much adjustability for saddle angle and position. Thus, a poor seatpost in this respect may make a good saddle for you not feel good. Brooks saddles, for example, are somewhat notorious for needing a decent amount of adjustability in the seatpost.</p>

<p>3) Make sure your bike is fit to you - if the saddle is in the wrong place (or other aspects of the fit are wrong), it won't feel good. </p>

<p>4) You may need a different saddle (as you assume).</p>

"How much should I spend on my helmet?","5673","","<p>I'm finally going to buy a bike next month.  And a helmet.  I'm wondering how much I should budget for buying a helmet.</p>

<p>I'll be riding around New York City, so I want good visibility around me.  And safety is a big concern for me as well.  </p>
","<p>Testing of helmets shows that there is little difference in impact protection. A better quality helmet, defined in this case as one that fits your head, is well ventilated, and looks good. </p>

<p>A well ventilated helmet prevents you from overheating while riding, especially at high speeds. A helmet that fits stays put on your head during a crash. And one that is comfortable and lightweight is less noticeable while you ride. </p>

<p>From a pure safety standpoint, buy a DOT/ANSI certified helmet, and you'll be fine. If you want to enjoy riding, and not mind wearing the helmet, be willing to spend more. $300 dollars is not out of line for a really high quality helmet, but that doesn't mean you need to spend that. </p>

<p>Find one that fits, ask your LBS to explain the ventilation differences between it and its more expensive cousins, and find one that fits in your budget. Looks good can be important, too, but that's personal and subjective.  </p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute
  submitted samples of six helmet models
  to a leading U.S. test lab: three in
  the $150+ range and three under $20.
  The impact test results were virtually
  identical. There were very few
  differences in performance among the
  helmets. Our conclusion: when you pay
  more for a helmet you may get an
  easier fit, more vents and snazzier
  graphics. But the basic impact
  protection of the cheap helmets we
  tested equaled the expensive ones.</p>
  
  <p>The results are a testimony to the
  effectiveness of our legally-required
  CPSC helmet standard. Although our
  sample was small, the testing
  indicates that the consumer can shop
  for a bicycle helmet in the US market
  without undue concern about the impact
  performance of the various models on
  sale, whatever the price level. The
  most important advice is to find a
  helmet that fits you well so that it
  will be positioned correctly when you
  hit. <a href=""http://www.bhsi.org/briefs.htm"">We have a page up with details of

"Does seat post suspension reduce efficiency?","5664","","<p>I have a hybrid bike with front and seat post suspension. It's easy to see how front suspension reduces pedaling efficiency by using some of the power for compressing the shocks, so I keep it locked on paved roads.</p>

<p>In situations where performance is more important than comfort, does a suspended seat post cause any harm to end results? I.e. would I get better times / speeds with a rigid saddle post?</p>
","<p>Seat post suspension is not designed for efficiency.</p>

<p>It is designed to add comfort to a hard tail mountain bike frame. There are only a few really good suspension seat posts, and they are rarely used on hybrid bikes. Almost always, you will find that the suspension post on a basic hybrid is just a spring in a tube. </p>

<p>Occasionally, they add the ability to pre-load the spring to make it feel stiffer, and that is a slightly better option. </p>

<p>On that type of suspension post, you affect your efficiency when the post is active because your seat height will change as you ride, and as the post compresses. This will change your position and leverage, and usually, not for the better. It will detract from the amount of power you are getting out of the system, while still using the same or more energy to put in that power.</p>

<p>A true full suspension will account for most of these factors, and is therefore generally a more efficient choice, but weight, cost, and designed riding style for a bike will also affect the efficiency.</p>

<p>To directly answer your question, yes, you would be more efficient without a suspension seat post, assuming all else was equal. </p>

<p>However, most hybrids are lacking in any number of areas in regards to efficiency, and you may not feel the actual difference in efficiency from the seat post given the bike you are riding. </p>

"Anti-puncture options","5643","","<p>I ride my bike to work. But every time I get a flat tire, my schedule is messed up because bike shops are not easily available on my town.</p>

<p>Is there any other option besides puncture-proof tires?</p>
","<p>Over the years I've dealt with a variety of puncture inducing issues ranging from desert thorns to broken glass to nails and tacks and metal shards.  While I agree with the other replies here that you shouldn't expect a puncture proof tire, there are some things you can do.  Below are some of the tips and tricks that I have picked up over the years.  The best answer for you is going to depend on what kind of bike you are using.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start with a high quality, puncture resistant tire.  I know you asked for other options, but a quality tire can make all of the difference.  The Schwalbe Marathon Plus HS 440 is easily the most puncture resistant tire that I have ever used.  I have arrived at work with ~50 desert thorns stuck into these tires without losing any air.  More details available here: <a href=""http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/Marathon_Plus_HS440"">http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/Marathon_Plus_HS440</a>.  Less industrious options (that are more suitable for road bikes where weight may be a concern) include the Continental 4000s and Continental GatorSkin tires.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that your tires are properly inflated.  And double check the pressure at least weekly.</p></li>
<li><p>Inspect and replace your tires frequently.  When your tires get too thin, they are more prone to punctures.  While there is no exact science as to when you should replace a tire, I tend to do it sooner than later and have found that this significantly reduces the number of flats that I get.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider using a sealant inside your tubes.  This is a liquid that will help to patch small holes in your tube as punctures happen.  The two leading options here are Slime and Stans.  Slime is thicker and is sold both pre-installed in a tube and separately (for injection into any tube). Stans is thinner and only sold separately (as far as I know).  You can use an inexpensive syringe kit to inject the sealant into a tube through the valve stem.  As a tire rotates the sealant will disperse throughout the tube.  In the event of a puncture, the air rushing out is mixed with sealant, which results in the puncture getting patched on the fly.  When it works properly, you might only lose a small amount of air and not even have to get off your bike.  Of course you should replace that air when possible.  And, depending on the size of the puncture, you may opt to replace that tube soonish as well.  Typically Slime is recommended for lower pressure tires whereas Stans works well in higher pressure tires, due to the tradeoffs inherent with the thickness of each sealant.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, when I was living the the US Southwest with lots of desert thorns, some people used a setup they liked to call ""the system"".  This involved taking an old tire and cutting off the bead.  Then installing this old tire between your tube and your new tire.  The second layer of rubber provides a powerful barrier against punctures.  Of course, it is also heavy and a large pain to install.  I'd suggest that this is somewhat extreme, but I know people that love it so I figured it was worth mentioning here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After taking all of these precautions, you should always carry the parts and tools needed to change a flat.  With luck, the suggestions above will significantly reduce your need to use such items.  But, it is always better to be prepared.  Again, depending on your bike you may want to carry 1 or more tubes, a portable pump, tire levers, CO2 cartridges, a tube patch kit (I personally don't like these because I find that getting a good patch is often a game of chance, but some people love them), and some nitrile gloves.</p>

<p>Since you're dealing with an old bike, I recommend just replacing the brake <a href=""http://www.loosescrews.com/index.cgi?d=single&amp;c=Cable/Casing&amp;sc=Brake%20Cable&amp;tc=&amp;item_id=LS-1001AC&amp;id=348157628674"" rel=""nofollow"">cable</a> and <a href=""http://www.loosescrews.com/index.cgi?d=single&amp;c=Cable/Casing&amp;sc=Brake%20Casing&amp;tc=&amp;item_id=WN-1400.1&amp;id=348157628674"" rel=""nofollow"">casing</a>. This can be done for less than 20 dollars. Before inserting the brake cable smear a thin layer of grease on it by running it past your fingers with a dab of grease.</p>

<p>If your levers are in good shape, slather the interior pivot points and cable anchor with grease. If not, then just replace them. Again, that can be done inexpensively-- and you can get ""<a href=""http://www.loosescrews.com/index.cgi?d=single&amp;c=Brake&amp;sc=Brake%20Levers&amp;tc=&amp;item_id=LS-13803&amp;id=348157628674"" rel=""nofollow"">aero brakes</a>"" which route the cable under the handlebar wrap (non-aero brakes are another thing the 70's can keep!).</p>

<p>Finally, there is nothing wrong with single pivot brakes. Yes, dual pivot is marginally better because they tend to stay in place (not rub the rim) and you get a barely noticeable increase in leverage. You absolutely will want to replace your brake pads, however. Modern brake pads are sooo much better. I and many others have had success with the koolstop dual compound brakes.</p>

"What are the advantages of owning a Unicycle?","5619","","<p>What are the advantages of owning a Unicycle, as opposed to owning a bicycle?</p>

<p>I can think of several:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are lighter and smaller than bikes</li>
<li>Easier to maintain, fewer moving parts</li>
<li>They provide good practice for balancing</li>
</ul>
","<p>One less obvious advantage is that they are not a bicycle, legally speaking. So while you can't ride on the road in most places, you can take one on public transport and into buildings etc. I commuted to university on one for that reason - I could ride into my lectures :) For a while anyway, there's the ""Moz Memorial Rule Against Unicycles"" now.</p>

<p>They work a different set of muscles, and train a differet set of reflexes. Balance skills are useful to have, and the entertainment value of a unicycle should not be ignored. Both in the ""I'm waiting, I know, I'll practice stairs"" and the ""look at me, put money in my hat"" senses.</p>

<p>For commuting I found a 26"" was ideal as a compromise between speed and size, although I ended up using a 20"" a lot just for easy of parking. If I could have got the Schlumpf hub it would have been perfect.</p>

"At what height should I have my seat on a road bike?","5609","","<p>I am currently riding a loaner from my brother in-law, and I have set the seat height based upon feel.  I was wondering though as to how I can set it to the right height for me to ride more scientifically?  </p>

<p>I will also need to set it back to his height when I give the bike back in a weeks time.</p>
","<p>There are a number of ways to determine the seat height for a road bicycle. But you should also pay attention to how you feel while riding your bike at different heights. In addition, it is important to consider your entire position, not only the seat height. Finally, if you are riding a lot, change your seat height in small increments over time to avoid injury.</p>

<p>Here are some of the popular methods for determining seat height:</p>

<ol>
<li>There should be some bend in your knee at the bottom of the stroke; 

<ol>
<li>your seat is too high if you should have to wobble your hips with each pedal stroke to reach the pedal.</li>
<li>Your seat is too low if your thighs hit your stomach  </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Sit on the bike, put your heel on the pedal, and your leg should be fully extended. This provides a good starting point </li>
<li>Another good starting point is Greg Lemond's recommendation from ""Greg LeMond's complete book of cycling"" states that the distance from the top of the seat to the center of the pedal should be 0.833 times the distance from the floor to your crotch, measured with your back and heels against a wall. If you use clipless pedals, subtract 3cm; </li>
<li>if you drop your heels at the bottom of the pedal stroke, decrease the height and if you point your toes, increase the height  relative to these recommendations.</li>
<li>When you need more control (crit racing, urban cycling, bicycle polo) lower the seat; for more power (hill climbing, time trialing), increase the seat height.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, once you get these starting points, you can adjust until it feels right. I would also suggest getting a professional fit, especially if you ride a lot or are planning to purchase a new bike. Probably the most important attribute of a new bicycle is it's fit. A proper fit will do more for your riding enjoyment, skill, and speed than any component or frame material (excluding department store bikes).</p>

"Do mudguards/fenders help? If so, what are the best for a fixie commuter?","5589","","<p>I ride an SE Lager fixed. I'm riding on sealed paths and roads pretty much all of my commute.</p>

<p>On wet days my bike picks up a lot of water and also a lot of sandy/silty residue. It coats the frame and also clogs up the chain a lot. I imagine that my chain life will be suffering because of this.</p>

<p>Has anyone tried running mudguards and seen what kind of a difference it makes? My fixie doesn't have a huge amount of frame clearance around the wheels so I'll need something fairly minimal. I've seen these <a href=""http://www.crudproducts.com/products/roadracer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Crud Roadracers</a> and they look like they have good coverage.</p>

<p>PS: I know that putting mudguards on a fixie is sacrilege (to some people... I'm not in that camp). But I'm running it for endurance and reduced maintenance, not exactly for style.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks for a bunch of awesome comments. However the thing I'm really wanting to focus on is whether I'll get a significantly longer lifespan for my running gear. I have waterproofs and don't mind the mess so much, I'm just trying to reduce my maintenance load and expense. The major areas I see that might be improved is chain (and therefore cogs) and maybe the bottom bracket, if I can reduce the amount of water hitting the seat pole and running down into the bracket.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I bought a pair of the <a href=""http://www.crudproducts.com/products/roadracer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Crud Roadracers</a> and, wow, they make such a difference. I rode on quite a wet day, but my running gear and clothes all stayed completely dry. I'm concerned they might not be durable for a commuter, but I'm certainly sold on mudguards/fenders for now.</p>
","<p>I have a pair of SKS Race Blades (<a href=""http://www.wiggle.co.uk/sks-race-blade-clip-on-mudguard-set"">e.g. from Wiggle</a>). They clip on and off really easily, for washing, security or just for the long days of summer when rain is decidedly unlikely. They are reasonably small and should fit all but the tightest of clearances. </p>

<p>For all the reasons you mention, I use them - cleanliness of my legs, back, bag and chain - but also because I like to at least play at being a good citizen. On my commute there are lots of other cyclists. Would you prefer to ride in the wet behind someone with or without guards? So the fact I'm being nice to my fellow cyclists is a really cool side benefit. </p>

<p>And if you think mudguards are sacrilege then, to be honest, you're probably not going to be reading this; style-over-substance hipsters are only dimly aware of the real reasons for cycling, only doing it because they think it's cool.

The crank is a Deore XT Hollowtech FC-M751, but I am not sure what the bottom bracket is.  The original specs of the bike are at this page</p>

<ul>
<li>Crank Extractor like <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/product/crank-puller-for-splined-cranks-ccp-44"">this</a> to remove the cranks.</li>

"What's a good, reliable mountain bike drivetrain (1x10?)","5568","","<p>I'm thinking about switching my Salsa El Mariachi 29er mountain bike from singlespeed to gears. I love the reliability and simplicity of the singlespeed, but I've been doing more rides that involve both road and trail riding, so it's tough to find a singlespeed gear ratio that can do both. </p>

<p>I do lots of really long (~75 mile) rides and some multi-day bikepacking trips through the Colorado backcountry, so I need a drivetrain that is really, really reliable. I'm also fairly tough on components (currently, I replace my SS drivetrain each year), so I want to get something that's not too expensive. I currently am running a bashguard (using a SLX triple crank), and I'd like to keep running a bashguard since it's awesome to have one. </p>

<p>I was thinking of running a 1x9, or maybe 2x9 (with bashguard) setup with SRAM X9 or X7 components. But then I read some great reviews of the new clutch derailleurs (Sram ""Type 2"" or Shimano ""Shadow plus"") - people are saying that they keep the chain running lot nicer than the old type derailleurs. I've heard good things about running a 1x10 with the new Shimano Zee derailleur. The many drivetrain options are getting a little ridiculous!</p>

<p>So, what do you think? What drivetrain will keep running through the dust, mud, and crashes, while still keeping the price to something reasonable? </p>

<p>Thanks, Dan</p>
","<p>I won't suggest any brands but here are some ingredients that will allow you to go cheap and reliable:</p>

<ul>
<li>go 1x9. 2x is more expensive, more noisy, heavier and generally problematic if you can get away with 1x. Just make sure you calculate some possible ring and cassete options so you know that you'll be able to tackle all ascents and descends you need to. A spreadsheet works great for that. Divide ring teeth to cassette teeth to find the ratios that you need. Ride friends' bikes on ascends and descends for find your numbers.</li>
<li>bashguard: Do you really need it? Please check on your existing one whether you see impacts. Have you used it so far? If not, you don't need one. Especially now that you'll go to a single and smaller ring, chances that you really need one are very slim.</li>
<li>chainring: Go with a ""narrow-wide"" one. There are at least 5 companies making such rings now. The narrow wide pattern of the teeth allows for maximum chain retention eliminating the need for a chain guide.</li>
<li>rear derraileur: Definitelly go with one which has a clutch mechanism. It does work wonders.</li>
<li>crank: You'll most probably be able to use your current SLX crankset, but I'm not 100% sure on that. There is a possibility that you'll need to do some research and play around with spacers in order to have the perfect chainline so all cogs of the cassette are working well.</li>
<li>chain: If you go 1x9 get a 9sp chain. If you go 1x10 get a 10sp chain.</li>

<p>The Shimano Alfine internal 8-speed hub is on several bikes I've liked. I've also heard good things about SRAM and Nexus hubs.</p>

<p>I ride in a wet / nasty winters / fairly flat environment here in Minnesota. I'm partial to lower gearing if it meant more reliability or lower cost.
I don't need max efficiency but all other factors are secondary to durability in my eyes.</p>

<p>How much maintenance can I expect a modern internal hub to require, and how long will it last before needing to be replaced?</p>
","<p>I bought a 700c Jericho hardtail in 1997, which came with a Rohloff 14 speed internally geared hub. I used it as a commuter for five years, at least 150 miles per week, 50 weeks of the year. That's 37500 miles. Even assuming I took a week or 2 out in there for whatever reason, call it 35000 miles. After that, I continued to ride it one or 2 days a week, for less strenuous rides. I have just sent it back for its first major service, other than lubing and cleaning the external components. </p>

<p>The Rohloff is a ridiculously burly hub. The Alfine, or the i-Motion9 would do well to match half that performance. But I'd say based on people I've sold bikes with Nexus or Alfine hubs, and how rarely we see them for service, and how much more rare it is that they need major service, that 20000 miles is not too much to expect.</p>

<p>The Shimano and SRAM hubs are both user serviceable, unlike the Rohloff, which should extend the useable life significantly also.</p>

<p>I was trying to find any formal service interval information, but both SRAM and Shimano say that aside from cleaning off the external parts, the hubs are ""well sealed"" and the service interval should be ""long"".</p>

<p>Sheldon Brown's site also says, ""Service should be quite rare on these well sealed hubs.""</p>

"Bottom Bracket Lube?","5513","","<p>Lately, after my normal wash &amp; lube routine, I've been squirting a little Teflon lube into the bottom bracket hub. I do so without dissembling by inserting the lube straw into the hub crevice. Is this advisable or a bad idea? </p>

<p>From what I can tell it seems to help prevent creaking, but maybe that's in my head. For what its worth I commute and ride often and live in the PNW (read: wetter than usual conditions).</p>
","<p>Your bike has a conventional threaded bottom bracket (square taper). Since its a relatively new bike, it shipped with a sealed (*) bottom bracket. So, the only maintenance that can be done is tightening the bottom bracket cups (which hold the bottom bracket in place) and replacing the bottom bracket itself (which is a sealed unit containing the bearings, axle, etc.</p>

<p>So, the lube you're squirting is just helping your head. You may have a loose bottom bracket cup which you can tighten by removing the crank arms and then using a bottom bracket tool to tighten them up. But otherwise, the only other maintenance that can be done is replacing the bottom bracket. </p>

<p>That being said, bicycles are notorious for having creaking seem to come from one area but its really coming from another (since bicycles are hollow tubes, they transmit sound in weird ways). My guess (unencumbered by the thought process) is if the creaking is coming from near the bottom bracket area, I'd start by looking at the crankset (chainring bolts, crank arms, pedals) and then the saddle/seatpost. There are lots of good pages on <a href=""http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/trouble-shooting-a-creaky-or-noisy-drive-train"">diagnosing creaks</a> (and <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/creaks.html"">this</a>).  And some bottom brackets just creak even if they're working fine.</p>

<p>(*) Sealed bearings don't mean that they're operating completely sealed away from the environment -- details are given in this <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/brandt/sealed-bearings.html"">article</a> by John Allen. But this point doesn't really matter in this case. </p>

"Fixed-gear bike: How to ride backwards?","5493","","<p>I have flipped over my hub to try out the fixed wheel for a change, I am finding it very difficult to keep balanced while attempting to ride backwards!  Does anyone have some advice or is there any trick to learning how to go backwards?</p>
","<p>Bicycles are designed in a way that makes them very stable going forward, at the cost of being unbelievably unstable while riding backwards. The most common fixed-gear geometry (inspired in track racing) doesn't help a lot. As a comparison, BMX is a modality where riders usually ride backwards in half-pipes, but the bike geometry is very different.</p>

<p>What I tried to do (before giving up), and what I have seen people doing, is to try to ride backwards IN CIRCLES, perhaps lowering the saddle a bit to a more relaxed position. I don't think the clipless or toestraps are key here, but a lower gear ratio might be very helpful.</p>

<p>After you perform some circle attempts, you can try to switch sides. Trying to do it very slow aids to gain inside as to which movement you actually have to do, since this movement is very counterintuitive: when you are leaning SLIGHTLY to one side, you have to point the handlebar the opposite way, so that the bike will go under you again.</p>

<p>I could manage to go some 4 meters back when I was trying often, but with almost no control over the direction the bike was going.</p>

And apparently for this scenario I can choose either of two possible kinds of bike:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A $700 bike with derailleurs, rim brakes, and 700 wheels ... I image that this is an extremely standard, common type of bike.</p></li>
<li><p>A $1250 bike with hub gears, hydraulic disc brakes, 700 wheels, and carbon forks and seat post ... these are higher-end features and it's rare to find them so cheap (and may require a much less local LBS).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I asked at a LBS (whose specialty is commuter bikes) about, what is the difference between say one of their $600 and $800 bikes; and the answer was, ""better components, more durability"": that more expensive wheels are 'stronger', etc.</p>

<p>I don't have any insight into how much, quantitatively, more-durable versus less-durable means.</p>

<p>Some arguments (perhaps the main/only arguments) for hub gears and hydraulic brakes are ""less or no maintenance"".</p>

<p>How much maintenance (not just what type of maintenance, but how much) does a cheaper bike require? How much less does a more expensive one? And/or, how much longer will more expensive components last? Might the more expensive components actually be more costly to maintain (because they're more difficult to service and more costly to replace), but require service less often?</p>
","<p>The cheaper bike will probably require you to adjust the brakes and gears plus lube the chain every week or two, and a bike shop to replace the brake pads, chain and cassette every 3-20Mm. For you, that's probably twice in the winter, once in the summer. With rim brakes you will also need new rims/wheels every couple of years, more often if the roads are gritty. But a lot depends on your riding style and the enthusiasm you have for maintenance (hence the 3-20 range). If ""lube the chain every week"" actually means ""the bike shop does that every month or two"", they'll probably be putting on a new chain. Count a monthly service at ~$50 and the chain/cassette/pads as $200 and that's $1000/year in maintenance, or $600 if you do the monthly service yourself.</p>

<p>It's important to note that you can skimp on all of this and it just means slightly more expensive fixes and a slightly worse riding experience (gears that skip under power, more resistance from damaged bearings, cables or chains the break, brakes that don't really work). When I was a mechanic I saw bikes where basically everything needed to be replaced, but people were still riding them (and just wanted a puncture fixed or a new basket or something). The bad riding experience means an hour for your 18km commute instead of 40 minutes.</p>

<p>With hub gears and disk brakes, especially with a full chain case, you'll lube the chain every couple of months, put new brake pads in every year or two, and I expect that replacing tyres will become your main dirty maintenance task. With a single-cable hub (Shimano, SRAM) you'll have to adjust the gears after a couple of months (the free service) then again a few months before you need a new gear cable. If you run Marathons or some other puncture-resistant tyre you should wear the tyre out without getting a puncture (a puncture is often the thing that makes you look at the tyre and go ""need a new one"". I run a Marathon Plus on the rear and have only had one puncture in at least 20Mm. I did get a 3"" nail through one though (with no puncture!)</p>

<p>Those numbers are why people often end up with a dedicated commuter bike that costs a fortune up front. New Rohloff Oil every year at $20 compared to a new Shimano hub every three years at $800 makes the $2000 up front cost of a Rohloff seem cheap (a Rohloff will last 100,000 kilometres or more... no-one really knows because there aren't many hubs that have done that distance yet, Rohloff only started about 10 years ago).</p>

"Why do we need front brakes?","5482","","<p>Most biking accident stories (ignoring collisions) that I hear about involve squeezing the frontbrake too hard and flipping over, often when biking on a downhill.</p>

<p>Read, for example, <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/25342/13145"">this fellow's story</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I commute to work a few miles on my bike in the city. Today someone
  walked out in front of me and I squeezed the brakes too hard and went
  over the handlebars. I suffered a mild elbow fracture because I put my
  arms out in front of me and the palms of my hands are destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my own experience, I've also pretty bad accidents with the front brake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was biking downhill (perhaps too fast), and hit the front brake. I
  then went flying Superman-style, while watching my bike turn at least
  three complete somersaults out of the corner of my eye. Not fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the question is -- why do we need front brakes? Since my accident, I've rarely (if ever) used my front brake, and I bike just fine.</p>

<p>I've also been very puzzled to rent bikes somewhere, and find that the bikes <em>only</em> had front brakes -- in my opinion, back brakes are much safer to use.</p>

<p><strong>So what do we need front brakes for?</strong></p>
","<p>I think you need to separate operator error from optimal mechanical functioning.  </p>

<h3>Mechanical advantage</h3>

<p>By your own anecdotal evidence you have demonstrated how powerful front brakes can be.  In short we have front brakes because they are the most powerful brake. When a bike (or any vehicle) decelerates weight is shifted to the front wheel.  Because bicycle tires work through static friction, and static friction is proportional to the force applied, under braking conditions the front wheel will have the most traction (assuming no additional forces, such as turning are applied).  By contrast the harder you brake the less force is applied to the rear wheel and the static friction of the rear tire decreases. As a result the harder you brake, the less traction the rear wheel has, which reduces maximal stopping force (a bit of a negative feedback loop going on here).</p>

<p>The problem as you identify is not with the physics behind the inclusion of the front brake but operator error.</p>

<h3>Correct Operation</h3>

<p>As your anecdotal stories indicate that many bicycle operators are unfamiliar proper body position during emergency braking. If you learn to move your weight back (ideally behind your saddle) during strong braking then going over the handle bars is nearly impossible (except under very steep hills).  On the flat, with correct body position, it is possible to break traction with the front wheel before going over the handle bars.</p>

<p>The issue then becomes one of education.  In essence you are asking whether front brakes should be removed because sufficient education on how to operate a bicycle is lacking for many.  That is a political question and is unclear if a ""right"" answer exists.</p>

<h3>Physics fun</h3>

<p>Event though a wheel is rolling traction is governed by the laws of static friction. When part of the tire touches the ground, it is not sliding across the ground (usually). From a physics perspective this can be considered a body a ""rest"" – as strange as that sounds.</p>

<p>The resistive force observed in a body at rest  is defined as</p>

<p><strong>F<sub>s</sub></strong> ≤ <strong>μ</strong> * <strong>F<sub>n</sub></strong></p>

<p>Where <strong>F<sub>s</sub></strong> is the resistive force, <strong>μ</strong> is the coefficient of friction and <strong>F<sub>n</sub></strong> is the normal force.  The normal force is the force applied perpendicularly to the measured resistive force, on an incline the normal force is less than on a flat surface.  The resistive force (<strong>F<sub>s</sub></strong>) can range from zero to a maximum of <strong>μ</strong> * <strong>F<sub>n</sub></strong>.</p>

<p>The resistive force is what does the braking or turning.  If braking or cornering exceeds the resistive force your tire slides. The coefficient of friction is related to factors such as tire compound, tire pressure and road surface.  The act of braking will not change it (unless you exceed the resistive force).  </p>

<p>Under braking  <strong>F<sub>n</sub></strong> increases for the front wheel and decreases for the rear wheel due to the weight shift. As such the maximal braking force that can be applied increase for front wheel and decreases for the rear wheel the harder you brake.</p>

<p>As long as you are not throwing other variables in, such as rider weight distribution (i.e., too much weight up front), changing road conditions, and exceeding a tires maximal resistive force (doing so no the front will make you crash).  The front wheel is the best place to focus braking forces.</p>

"What makes a good entry level road bike?","5467","","<p>I've been riding a mountain bike for years, but I prefer to go longer distances on paved ground, so I think a road bike would be better. When I ask what is a good bike, I don't need brands or models - more like what components of the bike should I look for, and what should I avoid? Additionally, is it necessary to ""go big or don't go at all"" as far as spending - getting a real good quality road bike for $500 to a few thousand, or should I cheap out on a $100-200 road bike, as it is my first, then get a better one when I'm more experienced?</p>
","<p>At the beginning of the summer I just bought an old Norco bike.  I have had tons of fun on it.  I watched Kijiji (similar to craigslist) every day for a month and eventually this bike came up.  It had never been ridden (there was not even a scratch on it) and the price was only $75 Canadian.  </p>

<p>Comparing my Norco to a friends $3000 Trek, here is what I found: </p>

<ul>
<li>The difference in weight between the bikes was less dramatic that I expected.  The newer bike weighed maybe 70% of what the older bike weighted.  </li>
<li>The newer bike had a much better shifting system.  The shifters where on the brake levers.  The older bike has shifters on the downtube.  To shift gears you need to remove your hand from the bars and reach down to the down tube.  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUOUY.jpg"" alt=""Brake Lever Shifting""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6npdO.jpg"" alt=""Down Tube Shifting""></p>

<ul>
<li>The hoods on the newer bike are more comfortable for longer rides.  </li>
<li>The newer bike has significantly more gears.  This is a pro and a con.  The older bike has only 6 gears on the back and 2 on the front.  One advantage to this is that the gears can be substantial thicker.  I have heard that these gears will <em>never</em> wear out.  </li>
<li>I am not scared to ride the older Norco to school and lock it up while I am working.  I would never do that with the more expensive bike.  </li>
<li>I had a crash on the older Norco the second day I was riding it that resulted in the the front wheel being destroyed.  Replacing it cost me $30.  On the expensive bike god only knows what that crash would have cost.  </li>
<li>The newer bike has some carbon in the frame.  In theory this should reduce the road vibration (and other things??).  The older bike is made entirely out of steel.  </li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, if you want to race you will need the better bike.  If you want to have fun, be active and go fast I think that the older road bike is an excellent entry point.  Probably I will invest in a better road bike at some point but I will defiantly still keep this bike to make grocery runs and ride to school.  (Maybe I will convert it to a single speed).  </p>

"How long should I expect handlebar tape to last?","5403","","<p>I assume that if handlebar tape is grimy, torn, or peeling, it should be replaced. How long should I expect handlebar tape to last before it needs to be replaced? How often do most cyclists replace handlebar tape?</p>
","<p>Anywhere from a month or two to years and years; how long handlebar tape lasts depends on too many factors to really answer this with a number. Of course, how often you cycle is a factor, but how good the tape is and how well it's applied also makes a difference. </p>

<p>For example, gel tape is notorious for wearing quickly, as the gel gets pushed away from where you lean your hands. Good-quality cork tape without a lot of padding can be kept around nearly forever, unless you rip it or it starts to stink. Tape that's wrapped <em>way</em> too tightly can develop rips and cracks. And if you have cables routed under your tape, that <em>can</em> subtly move the tape around a little bit as you shift, causing you to need to rewrap or replace more often. </p>

<p>How much weight you put on the bars, how tightly (or loosely) you wind the tape, how good the tape is - all these will change how long it'll take until you have to change the tape or simply rewrap it. </p>

<p>One thing that's worth noting is that if you're wearing through the tape itself, you're probably putting too much weight on your hands or gripping the bars far too tightly. And cork or plastic bar tape that simply comes loose over time can be rewound. </p>

"Can you ride a bicycle at 90 km/h on a flat road?","5391","","<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWwwuCK-3iQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This video</a> was featured in a leading news website in my country. It's a cyclist riding on a highway with very high velocity - said to be 90 km/h - close behind a truck. The road is flat, so it keeps puzzling me: how could he reach and maintain such a high speed? Is it even possible to do this without any external help, e.g. grabbing the truck? Is it the ""air-dragging"" effect of the truck that makes it possible?</p>

<p>P.S.: I myself don't have too much experience with biking - I ride a mountain bike, my highest speed on flat surface was about 40 km/h, and I found maintaining it pretty exhausting. Couldn't have kept it for more than a couple of minutes.</p>
","<p>In my younger foolish years I actually did this exact scenario, except at a slightly lower speed 85 kph (speed limit was 80 km/hr), but for a distance of nearly 10 km (between two suburbs).  In my case I drafted a double trailer gravel truck which was very slow to accelerate making it easy to keep pace. This was only possible due to the massive low pressure wake at the rear of the vehicle.</p>

<p>I was on a road bike with a max gearing of 53-11.  When we were at speed I remember spinning like crazy to keep up, typically I would have to do it in pulses where I would bridge up a foot or two to secure a better position in the draft, then take a quick rest.  Adrenaline really keeps you motivated in this type of situation.  I even remember a few cars driving up beside and staring in amazement or disbelief - I am not sure which one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The road is flat, so it keeps puzzling me: how could he reach and maintain such a high speed? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really depends how fast the vehicle accelerates. It needs to accelerate slow enough so that you can keep pace and remain in the draft. At the time I had no trouble hitting 50 kph on my own for short periods so I had the acceleration needed to keep pace until the draft really started to kick in.  At higher speeds it is amazing how much the draft really sucks you along, you really don't need to generate crazy power, just have enough leg speed so that you can keep pace in your largest gear. </p>

<p>At 80+ kph you need at minimum 53-11 gearing.  Even then I could barely stay on top of the gear, I had to spin incredibly fast.  I had a bike computer at the time, but I never checked the cadence, just my speed which was 80-85 kph.  At that time (late 1990's) you didn't have many data loggers, which record every moment in detail for posterity like we do today, so I can't offer any more detail than this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it even possible to do this without any external help, e.g. grabbing the truck? Is it the ""air-dragging"" effect of the truck is what makes it possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As long as you keep close to the back of the truck the draft literally sucks you along. Once in the draft you really don't need a ton of power, just the ability to spin fast so you can keep nudging yourself back up into the sweet spot of the draft. I tried to minimize my risk exposure by drafting to the side of the truck, so I had a shot of getting over to the shoulder quickly if the truck suddenly braked. This meant I lost a bit of the draft, but given the insanity of the situation I felt it was a reasonable compromise.  Others seem a bit more brave drafting in the dead centre (pun intended).</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: All this is of course incredibly foolish and could quickly descend into disaster.  At the time I was young and clueless.</strong></p>

"How to remove bicycle decals?","5390","","<p>My Surly Crosscheck has decals I want to remove - they are clear plastic decals with leterring on top :""Fatties Fit Fine"" etc.</p>

<p>What is the best way to remove these without discoloring the paint job?</p>
","<p><em>If all else fails, refer to the instructions...</em></p>

<p>Incredibly, Surly have an online guide for how to remove the decals:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.surlybikes.com/blog/spew/3_-_single-speed_drivetrains/"">http://www.surlybikes.com/blog/spew/3_-_single-speed_drivetrains/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not apply a clear coat over our decals. Except for one brief period a long time ago, we never have. Yeah, your frame’s decals can get scuffed up. But we have never thought scuffed decals look bad. In fact, we see them as a badge of honor, showing that you use your bike. Having exposed decals is kind of nice for other reasons too. For one thing, adding clear coat costs more money and we would charge you that money. Do want to pay extra for that? Great, take your frame to a painter and have him or her add a clear coat. Some folks want their bike logo free to help avoid theft. Others want black decals instead of white, or vice versa. Some people just don’t want advertising on their bike.  Some people want to add decals after a new paint. We sell decals kits for all our frame models, in both all black and white with a black outline. Find them here.</p>
  
  <p>If you should want to remove the decals that came on your frame or apply new ones, we’ve put together this little tidbit with some helpful suggestions. Again, they’re SUGGESTIONS, not gospel. Experience helps. If you know someone who has done this before, ask them to help you. Patience helps too. Go slow, think about each step. You’ll save yourself time, money, and aggravation. And at no time should you use ‘hot’ paint thinners or adhesive removers such as naphtha, acetone, paint strippers, oven cleaners, etc. There is no need to bring a machine gun to a knife fight. Use mineral spirits, Goo Gone, something of that ilk, and use enough to get the job done. And be sure you’re in a well ventilated area. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Removing Surly frame decals:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Use a credit card or a plastic spoon or something else with a somewhat hard edge to flake the decals off. Don’t use anything too hard, because you could gouge or scratch the paint. Use a hair dryer to soften the adhesive prior to poking at the decals with the credit card edge. Once the decal is removed, apply adhesive remover with a clean soft cloth to remove remaining adhesive. Finish with rubbing alcohol or multipurpose cleaner to make it look all pro.</p>
  
  <p>There are other, quicker methods, but due to the risks to your paint, the steel under the paint, and potentially to yourself we have advised ourselves not to share these methods. Don’t ask what they are because we won’t tell you. Just be advised that if you try to warranty a frame that looks like it has been damaged by excessive heat or chemicals, we will laugh in your face. We will probably even say we told you so.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Applying Surly frame decals:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Assuming the old decals are nicely removed, clean the surface with some sort of degreaser or rubbing alcohol. Directly prior to installation of decals the tube surface should be dry and clean of dirt, grease, etc. </p>
  
  <p>Your decals, as they come packaged, are comprised of three layers. The decals themselves are sandwiched by a clear plastic top layer over the decals and a paper backing covering the adhesive on the back side of the decals. The adhesive is quite sticky. Once they’re stuck, they’re stuck, even if they’re stuck in the wrong place.  </p>
  
  <p>Place the decal –with all layers intact- in the desired position on the frame tube, eyeing up their alignment on the tube. You might consider drawing vertical and horizontal center lines on the cover layer of the decals, to aid in alignment. Once you have determined the proper position, use tape along the top edge of the decal overlapping to the frame itself to hold its position. </p>
  
  <p>Carefully remove the backing paper, being careful to hold the decal out from the tube. Avoid letting the decal touch the tube! Sheesh…</p>
  
  <p>Starting at the top (where the tape is), at the middle of the decal, begin pressing the decal into place. Apply gentle but firm pressure and work from the middle top (by the tape) out and down. Work slowly to avoid wrinkles or bubbles.  These decals are not vinyl…you cannot simply pull them up and start over. Easy does it. Watch what you’re doing. No pressure. You’re doing great.</p>
  
  <p>Once the entire decal has been applied, go over it once more, pressing it down to make sure it is completely adhered to the frame. Beginning at one end, slowly and gradually peel the clear cellophane from the front of the decal. For best results, the cellophane should be pulled at an acute angle parallel to the frame tube. Pulling away from the tube may result in chunks of the decal pulling off, especially if not fully adhered. And this would be bad because you’d have to remove it and start all over. </p>
  
  <p>O.K., rub it a little more to make sure it is fully adhered. Adhesed?  Whatever. Crack a beer and stare at it for a little while. Feel all satisfied n’ stuff.   </p>
  
  <p>Now go do the other side.</p>

"How much faster can i go after moving from 2x10 to a 3x10 gear setup?","5390","","<p>My 26"" mountain bike currently has a 2x10 gear setup with SRAM components: a SRAM S-1250 crank with 38/24 chainrings, and a SRAM PG-1030, 10-speed, 11-36t cassette. I feel that when riding on non-technical dirt trails I am maxing out my drive-train, meaning that I am not able to accelerate beyond a certain speed when riding the 'hardest' gear.
I have been reading about the Shimano 3x10 system which may allow me to reach higher speeds, due to higher possible transfer ratios. So, how much faster can I with a 3x10 setup? please elaborate on the math in your answer...</p>
","<p>Well, if you switch to 3 in front, and then make it a 52/38/24 set (equal steps) then your theoretical new maximum speed would be:</p>

<pre><code>[new max]=52/38*[Your current max]
</code></pre>

<p>Currently at your top speed one revolution of your crank leads to 38/11th of a revolution of your rear wheel. This will become 52/11th or about 1.37 times as much.</p>

<p>This is not the whole story however. You probably know that wind resistant is much more of an issue at higher speeds than rolling resistance. So (unless you are really strong) your actual maximum will be quite a bit lower than the theoretical maximum calculated above. <a href=""http://bikecalculator.com/what.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This tool</a> allows you to set your speed or power output and calculate the other. If I assume your current max as 30kph, your bike weight at 9kg, your weight at 70kg (don't be offended, I'm just guessing), and you are on MTB tires and in the ""hoods"" position (whatever that is) then your power output at that speed would be about 220 Watt. With the extra chainring in front your theoretical maximum speed would be 41.1kph (all other variables being equal) but to attain it you would need to about 470 Watt! More than twice as much!</p>

<p>Obviously in your current situation you are not pedaling efficiently at your maximum speed because you are spinning your legs like crazy, but a 1.4 times speed gain is probably too much to hope for. As a test to see where you can get you could ask your friendly LBS owner if he'll lend you a bigger front chainring for a test ride and see if you can find out from that at what point you max out. </p>

"Can I measure my bottom bracket size without removing the cranks?","5371","","<p>I don't have a LBS (there are BS, but not L), so I generally order everything I need online.

<p>I plan on using a <a href=""http://www.bicorp.com.au/ProductDisplay.aspx?Product=BBS1568118"" rel=""nofollow"">Sunrace BB</a> as the replacement, which is available in <em>103</em>, <em>107</em>, 111, 113, 118, 122, 124, and <em>127</em> mm lengths (italics are out of stock at my preferred supplier).</p>

<p>The obvious answer here is to take the BB out and measure it; trouble is, there's no crank puller or BB tool available—I'll be ordering these with the new BB. I've also tried contacting the bike's manufacturer (a bicycle chain store—I know), but they've been non-responsive.</p>

<p>The best I've managed so far was an attempt to measure the distance from the outside of one crank to the other (at the BB), then remove the crank bolts and subtract the distances from the outside of the crank to the end of the bottom bracket axle. This gave a (rudimentary, at best!) measurement of 129 mm.</p>

<p>I can possibly order a couple of BBs and return one, but I'd really like to be able to narrow it down that much, at least. Is it better to be too long, or too short (or does it really need to be exact)?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I measured the chainline yesterday, it's 53 mm at the front (I know that's wide, but that's what it is) and 48.5 mm at the back. The rear cassette is a 7-speed Shimano 14-28.</p>

<p>Essentially you measure from the center of the chain rings (triple is easy, double measure half way between the rings) to the center of the seat tube to get your chain line. Then you should be able to match up a BB that will suit.  </p>

"Why do some bicycles have much bigger wheels than most motorcycles?","5313","","<p>Let's consider a mountain bike and a motorcycle. Each one has a need to be as usable as possible and overcome obstacles more effectively. Larger wheels usually mean greater cross-country ability. So what is the theory behind bicycles usually having bigger wheels than motorbikes?</p>
","<p>Gearing is a factor, although by no means the only factor. Common wheel sizes allow for conveniently sized sprockets, both front and rear. The bike industry has always been driven by what racers need, and pro cyclists can reach 100 kph+ on a downhill. The higher a gear you can be in, the less likely you are to ""spin out"" and no longer be able to pedal effectively. The larger the wheel, the further you move in one revolution. The internal combustion engine can achieve 1000s of RPM, an order of magnitude above what human legs can sustain, which at least in a lab setting start to lose efficiency by around 100 rpm (<a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-004-1175-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-004-1175-5</a>), and above a certain point (which is perhaps the topic of it's own question) are totally unable to keep up with the pedals, let alone apply meaningful power. That's why penny-farthing style bicycles had such big wheels, since the cranks were attached directly to the wheel, the only way to go faster was to get a bigger wheel. </p>

<p>Chain drive and gearing fixed this issue, allowing for smaller and lighter wheels and a top-tube below crotch height. But there's practical limits to how how large a chainring and how small a rear sprocket you can use. Too large a chainring will start to flex (this was more of an issue before modern materials), and currently the smallest rear sprocket on a standard cassette is 11 teeth, on old 5-speed freewheels it was usually a 14 tooth. A 700c wheel with a 25mm tire can reach ~73kph @ a cadence of 120 rpm with a standard racing 53 tooth chainring and an 11 rear sprocket. To get the same gearing, a 20"" BMX wheel would need a 75 tooth chainring that would be roughly 12"" in diameter, and a 16 inch folding bicycle wheel would need an 83 tooth, 14"" diameter chainring.  As well as flexing, they would need to ensure the bottom bracket was high enough to keep the chainring from brushing the ground when cornering or on rough terrain (curbs, potholes, roots, and the like). </p>

<p>And some bikes do actually have very small wheels, like folding bikes. But their top speed is limited. Some rear cassettes with 9 tooth smallest sprockets have been made (See <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/capreo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sheldonbrown.com/capreo.html</a>), but engineering concerns make them expensive and prone to wear. And even then, standard 26"" and 28"" (aka 700C aka 29"") wheel sizes were set 100+ years ago, and folding bikes tend to look ""goofy"" to people compared to more conventional bikes. And the UCI likes mandating that modern racing bikes have roughly the same form as they did in the 70s, including a diamond frame and wheels between 55 and 70 cm. </p>

<p>Another standard reason given why mountain bikers should favor 29"" wheels over 26"" inch wheels is that they ""roll better"". The larger diameter means that it gets stuck less in small ruts and holes, rolling over it rather than down into it. The larger tires also mean a larger volume of air, and thus less need for suspension. Motorcycles are already much heavier (with the requisite power to move much more weight), so beefing up the suspension is less of a problem. The 26"" vs 29"" (vs 27.5"") question is far from settled, but the trend is moving towards bigger wheels, not smaller ones. </p>
