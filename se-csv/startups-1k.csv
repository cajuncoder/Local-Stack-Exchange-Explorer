"What is the difference between Founder and Co-Founder?","49034","","<p>I have incorporated a company recently with my friend.</p>

<p>I have 90% equity and He has 10%.</p>

<p>Since we both founded the company, I guess we both have the same title ""Co-Founder"".</p>

<p>But when I talk with my other friend who has a 1 year old company, he was telling me that ""Founder"" title applies for the person who came up with the idea.</p>

<p>Although I came up with the idea, I feel that it doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p>So can some one clear my doubts?</p>

<p>PS: We are going to print business cards. That's why I'm asking this question</p>
","<p><strong>All co-founders are founders.</strong> Which is to say that ""Name, Founder"" might mean a founder or the founder of a company; the use of co-founder removes this ambiguity. </p>

<p>Some people say they're ""the founder"" when they really ""a founder"" (aka co-founder), which in my opinion, depending on the context and awareness of the other co-founders might make sense.</p>

<p>Neither the percent of equity a party holds, nor their role, are not related to being labeled a founder. </p>

<p>All that matters is that all the ""founders"" agree they're founders, and sometimes this doesn't even matter; I've seen people who call themselves a founder and the other founders claim they're not.</p>

<p>Lastly, I know of lots of ""founders"" that don't like the title, and don't use it.</p>

"What does the acronym GmbH mean and what kinds of companies is it used for?","16085","","<p>Sometimes I see this acronym in names of companies based on Germany. </p>

<p>What does this acronym means? What are its characteristics?</p>
","<p>Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) is a type of legal entity very common in Germany (where it was created in 1892), Austria (adopted in 1906; legal abbreviations are GmbH, GesmbH, Ges.m.b.H.), Switzerland, and other Central European countries. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gesellschaft = <em>Society / Organization</em> </li>
<li>mit  = <em>with</em> </li>
<li>beschränkter = <em>Limited</em>  </li>
<li>Haftung = <em>Liability</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Literally translating as company with limited liability, the concept mit beschränkter Haftung inspired the legal establishment of the limited liability company form in other countries, although the concept of a limited liability company already existed in the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>The name of the GmbH form emphasizes the fact that the owners (Gesellschafter, also known as members) of the entity are not personally liable for the company's debts. Other variations include mbH (used when the term Gesellschaft is part of the company name itself), and gGmbH (gemeinnützige GmbH) for non-profit companies.</p>

<p>The GmbH has become the most common corporation form in Germany, since the AG (Aktiengesellschaft), the other major company form corresponding to a stock corporation, was until recently much more complicated to form and operate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GmbH is based on the idea of a fixed minimum capital, 
  which is available at the sole discretion of the managers and may not be returned to 
  the shareholders. And the shareholders are generally required to provide real 
  funds, i.e. equity to the GmbH.</p>

"How can I know if my developer is doing a good job?","14165","","<p>I don't know anything about code except some basic HTML.</p>

<p>Recently, I hired a freelance developer to do some front-end updates on my e-commerce website. Because of the nature of e-commerce websites, I care a lot about showing up in search results and having fast page loads.</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with the result so far, but I have no idea whether my developer has coded well, or if they have any talent or skill at it. On top of that, he charged me for twelve hours of work, and I really can't judge if that's a reasonable amount of time for my update and if he's being honest about working time.</p>

<p>How can I, without a technical background, judge the technical skill and honesty of a freelance developer like this? I would be open to hiring a code review service, if there is such a thing.</p>
","<p>If you are running an IT business you should be familiar with codes (and everything else related to your business) so the first way to solve this problem is</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn principles of coding</p></li>
<li><p>Another way to solve this problem is to find a technical partner or a technical advisor (if you are in IT business at least one of the founders should be technical)</p></li>
<li><p>Like you said there are code review services which you can hire such as <a href=""https://www.airpair.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">airpair</a> or <a href=""http://ocscodereview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OCS</a></p></li>
<li><p>Use the Goal/Measure system, set a goal for him to do and then measure it. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example if you are ranked around 30 in google and you want to get in top 5 measure it by going to google through various proxies.
Or if your site loads in 0.8secs and you want to bring it down to 0.4 measure it by using an online tool such as <a href=""https://www.otreva.com/calculator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web speed test</a>. 
Though to measure and estimate every task like this you must search the internet and learn how it works for every single goal.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can also use online calculators which are really usefull to estimate freelance costs. <a href=""https://www.otreva.com/calculator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Otreva</a> and <a href=""http://www.kinvey.com/app-cost-estimator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kinvey</a> are good for mobile, <a href=""http://www.webpagefx.com/How-much-should-web-site-cost.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">webpagefx</a> and <a href=""http://www.comentum.com/ecommerce-cms/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">comentum</a> are good for web development. By using these you can easily figure out if the freelancer is charging you too much or too little for a given feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly like <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/3115/1345"">this answer has mentioned</a>, you can hire freelancers from platforms such as <a href=""https://www.elance.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">elance</a>, <a href=""http://www.guru.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">guru</a> or <a href=""https://www.odesk.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">odesk</a> for the best freelance experience. </p></li>

"Copy a website (design, feature, etc) is illegal?","13883","","<p>Is copying the design of an existing website or feature illegal? Either way, what problems might I run into if I do it?</p>

<p>I understand that the logo, products, and contents are a different story, but I don't have a web designer to create my own website, and I'd like to start off with the base design of some of the great websites out there. For example, I could copy Amazon, eBay, or another popular site. I don't have the abilities to build my system exactly like theirs, but I am curious of how similar I can make mine.</p>
","<p>Copying the design of a website could get you in trouble on two fronts, both aspects, no surprise, of intellectual property: copyright and trademark.</p>

<p>Also, in this answer I'm assuming that you're in the United States. If you're in a country without an IP treaty, that could mean the rules are different.</p>

<h1>Copyright</h1>

<p>Copyright is a little more likely, but you'd want to think about both of them. Copyrights protect artists, via protecting their artwork. A website is artwork, just as a book, architectural design, piece of music, or pattern on fabric are artwork. As such, it receives a copyright immediately upon creation. Registration is required to enforce said copyright, but every one could get a registration at any time (for the right price, that is). As such, it's pretty important to avoid directly copying design (be that HTML or, arguably less seriously, CSS) without the proper license.</p>

<p>Companies like Amazon do have registered copyrights, and will more than likely enforce them.</p>

<h1>Trademark</h1>

<p>Trademarks are a little bit different. It's probably pretty easy to get around, and you'd more than likely only have problems if you were specifically doing this with the intention of imitating them, but trademarks protect consumers, via locking down branding. Virtually anything that makes a business <em>feel</em> like that business could be subject to trademark, as long as it's not necessary to do that business. Names and logos are the most obvious examples of this, as you've covered, but it can extend on through some other mediums: a good example is the shape of a Coke bottle, or the color pink as used in fiberglass insulation.</p>

<p>If you copy another business's website and use it as your own doing more or less the same thing, it could be possible that a consumer would be confused and think they were dealing with that original business, when in fact they were dealing with you. In that case, it's possible that you could be found to be infringing on their trademark.</p>

<p>Again, that's pretty unlikely to happen, all in all, especially if you are in fact trying to make it look like you didn't directly copy from them, but you should keep it in mind.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I'd say you have, let's say three and a half, good options, and copying directly isn't one of them:</p>

<ol>
<li>The most obvious one is ""get a web developer."" It's probably worth it, these days.</li>
<li>You could read their HTML and get some ideas about how you'd want to set your own up. It's okay to be inspired by places and use them to teach you what you should do.</li>
<li>You could use HTML that's licensed for this. This could come in two forms:
<ol>
<li>There are a ton of ""build your own website in minutes"" services out there, and the place that you're hosting with might well offer one. They'll have templates that are solid, and completely legal to use.</li>
<li>If you're a bit more development-minded, there are a bunch of more generally applicable template frameworks, like <a href=""http://getbootstrap.com/"">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. They can make building a site that looks awesome very easy, but you will have to have a fundamental understanding of website building.</li>

"How much equity should a first employee be offered?","9950","","<p>How much equity should a first employee be offered?</p>

</ul></li>
<li>Company has a single large client as source of revenue (with more potential clients in the near future)

<li>Salary being offered is ~25% below market rate for the area until funding is raised, then salary will be increased to ~7.5% below market rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these parameters, what would be an appropriate amount of equity to offer to a first engineering hire?</p>
","<p>I'm not sure I would feel comfortable giving a solid number in response to this, just because there are a number of factors that I couldn't possibly know about the circumstances. I'll try and go over a few of those, but I think it's ultimately--no surprise--up to you to really establish what you want to give the person.</p>

<p>It's certainly not the same question, but some similar themes are present here as are in <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/195/best-way-of-dividing-equity-among-founders"">Best way of dividing equity among founders</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Individual's Value</strong></p>

<p>This one is two parts subjective and one part based on market knowledge (which it sounds like you have). Basically, and I'm taking some of this from my <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/186/59"">answer</a> to <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/184/is-employee-value-derived-from-their-equity"">Is employee value derived from their equity?</a>, equity should be used as a tool to gain leverage over competition. To justify use of that tool, you'll want to make sure that the person you're seeking is actually <em>worth it</em>. You don't want to offer someone 20% of your company, when realistically you could get someone of equal value to you for much less. Here's where you have to review the person's résumé and, well, je ne sais quoi. Estimate how much the person would be worth to competitors (which also includes a look at how many equally qualified people there are on the market), and estimate how much the person thinks your business is actually worth <em>to the new hire</em>.</p>

<p>Remember that whatever value you place to your business's likelihood of success, that number might vary from that of your potential hire. Hopefully his or hers won't be too much lower than yours (and if it is, they probably won't value your workplace enough to be a great contributor), but you need to take that into account when establishing a good amount of equity. If he or she is crazy-excited about your business, a small amount of equity will go a whole lot longer than if he or she is just looking for something to pay the bills and happened across your ad. Of course, <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/46/59"">keeping morale up</a> is part of the key here.</p>

<p><strong>Risk</strong></p>

<p>This can help you assess how much the new hire might consider your company worth, as well as giving indication of how much they're <em>owed</em>. How much risk is the potential employee putting in? If they've been job-hunting for two years and you're the first person willing to give them a serious offer, that's not much risk. However, if you're offering them a signing bonus to drop out of university because they're the only perfect candidate, you'd better be ready to back that with a higher amount of equity.</p>

<p><strong>Irreplaceability</strong></p>

<p>I'm following a bit what I said in my previously-linked-to ""best way of dividing equity"" answer, and this part is important too. You mention that your founders are all non-technical and this is the first technical person. That probably means their work will wind up very, for lack of a better word, ""entangled"" with them, personally. If we're talking SDEs, their work will likely be difficult to understand by even a second developer coming on, without them to help out. It's not always the case, but it certainly can be. That raises the stakes in a distinct way. You want to keep them around, and should probably then give them more equity to support their interest. In a way, your first technical hire (assuming this is a tech company) will become a founder of sorts for you. He or she will be offering input that you couldn't have without a similarly seasoned professional. Value that.</p>

<p><strong>Plans for Future Employees</strong></p>

<p>Once you've worked that all out, you'll want to think about what your future plans are. This is a new hire, not a founder, that you're talking about giving equity to. Will you give it to every new hire from now on (<a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/342/at-what-point-should-i-stop-offering-equity-as-part-of-compensation-to-new-hires"">hint-hint</a>)? If someone you pull on right now gets a certain amount, and someone you pull on in six months gets more, that could be an unfortunate situation, even if the later person has more qualifications or risk. Try to have a plan ahead of time, and set precedent now if you can.</p>

"Better to learn programming, or hire a programmer?","6079","","<p>My potential company would be a website and a mobile app.</p>

<p>That means <strong>web</strong> (php, SQL, AJAX, etc.) and <strong>mobile</strong> (Android, iOS, etc.) programming.</p>

<p>I only have light programming experience. HTML, Batch (for Windows), Microsoft Access Databases, and Powershell (barely). That's it. I'm starting to understand basic programming and database concepts as I use them more.</p>

<p>I feel I have enough knowledge to be able to talk to programmers and explain what I want, however for me to build it myself would require a significant amount of time to learn all the intricate details of a specific language before I could do what I want. (2-3 years)</p>

<p>To me, this is akin to what a real-estate investor once told me: <strong>""Don't wait 30 years to save up enough to do your one first deal. Find somebody who's already done that for 30 years, and use their money.""</strong></p>

<p>I really would like to learn programming. I would like to make this my pet project, have complete ownership, understand its complete underworkings, and know what it is possible to do. I would love to bring on another coder much later in the project's development, bounce ideas off him, and together make sure the code is beautiful. </p>

<p>I just don't think it's economical. The business-side of me keeps telling me that's too long to wait.</p>
","<p><strong>Coding takes a lot of brain juice and energy that you should rather be investing in business strategy, marketing, making connections, hiring people, writing business plans, pitching etc.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Don't bother to learn programming.</strong> This rabbit hole is too deep. You'll never stop learning and this is not your focus.</p>

<p>Your focus and target should be to make profit &amp; hustling in all ways possible. You target should not be to hunker down in front of a laptop and make a pixel perfect products etc. That's what engineers are for.</p>

"How do founders retain equity round after round when raising funds?","5685","","<p>I see companies having raised $50-100 million over the span of two years and having over 20 investors. How much equity do the original founders of the company typically get to keep upon having done so, and how do they manage to keep that amount?</p>

<p>Further, I understand that their equity retains its value, but I'm still confused: how is it in the founders' interest to dilute their shares in their own company, other than being the (natural) management team?</p>
","<p>TL;DR: How do founders retain equity?   </p>

<p>By having an awesome business where everybody wants to invest in making your pre-money evaluation higher.</p>

<p>Some Definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Valuation Types</strong><br>
• Pre-Money: What the company is worth BEFORE any additional capital is invested.<br>
• Post-Money: What the company is worth AFTER additional capital is invested.<br>
You have a pre-money of $4M, raised $1M and your post-money valuation is $5M. Investor gets 20% of your company. </p>

<p><strong>Option Pool</strong><br>
A pool of Units/Shares in the company to be used to attract and incentivize employees. If they are never issued, they just disappear.<br>
• Fully Diluted Ownership Share: Percentage of Ownership if ALL options were issued.<br>
• Undiluted Ownership Share: Percentage of Ownership not counting unissued shares. If the company sold today, this is the current ownership amount.</p>

<p>For simplicity I am leaving option pools out of the calculation. You can expect 5-20% of your shares going in there.</p>

<p>At the founding day:<br>
Cool people, cool idea, no value.  </p>

<p>Stark Industries - Total Shares: 1M - Share Value: $0 - Total Value: $0<br>
 - Howard Stark - CEO - 40% - 400k shares<br>
 - Tony Stark - CTO - 30% - 300k shares<br>
 - Pepper Potts - CMO - 25% - 250k shares<br>
 - Nick Fury - Advisor - 5% - 50k shares  </p>

<p>Stark Industries needs an investment and calculated that they have a pre-valuation of $800K. They are looking for $200K for R&amp;D. Their post-money worth is $1M.</p>

<p>Angel Round:<br>
250k new shares are issued at $0.8 per share</p>

<p>Total Shares: 1.25M - Share Value: $0.8 - Total Value: $1M<br>
 - Howard Stark - 400k shares - 32% - Networth: $320k<br>
 - Tony Stark - 300k shares - 24% - Networth: $240k<br>
 - Pepper Potts - 250k shares - 20% - Networth: $200k<br>
 - Nick Fury - 50k shares - 4% - Networth: $40k<br>
 - Investor: Reed Richards - 250k shares - 20% - Networth: $200k  </p>

<p>Company doing fine, now need some serious investment to build robots and sh*t. Getting an investment of $2m with premoney of $8m and post money valuation of $10m.</p>

<p>Series A VC Round:  </p>

<p>Total Shares: 1.56M - Share Value: $6.41 - Total Value: $10m<br>
 - Howard Stark - 400k shares - 25% - Networth: $2.5m<br>
 - Tony Stark - 300k shares - 19% - Networth: $1.9m<br>
 - Pepper Potts - 250k shares - 16% - Networth: $1.6m<br>
 - Nick Fury - 50k shares - 3% - Networth: $320k<br>
 - Reed Richards - 250k shares - 16% - Networth: $1.6m<br>
 - VC: Wilson Fisk - 312k shares - 20% - Networth: $2m  </p>

<p>Great our robots fly and shoot lasers, now we need to mass produce them to fight Loki. Getting an investment of $20m with premoney of $80m and post money valuation of $100m.</p>

<p>Series B VC Round:</p>

<p>Total Shares: 1.95M - Share Value: $51.28 - Total Value: $100m<br>
 - Howard Stark - 400k shares - 20% - Networth: $20.5m<br>
 - Tony Stark - 300k shares - 15% - Networth: $15.3m<br>
 - Pepper Potts - 250k shares - 13% - Networth: $12.8m<br>
 - Nick Fury - 50k shares - 2% - Networth: $2.5m<br>
 - Reed Richards - 250k shares - 13% - Networth: $12.8m<br>
 - Wilson Fisk - 312k shares - 16% - Networth: $16m<br>
 - Norman Osborn - 390k shares - 20% - Networth: $20m  </p>

<p>So you see how the founders get diluted as the company grows. But the main point is you need to be focusing on your shares value. Which is increased by increasing the total value of your company. It is obvious how the founders get richer by producing a valuable company.</p>

<p>Most likely the investors I listed in here won't be single but multiple firms and people. But it doesn't matter how many people invest, your company has a pre-money valuation and post-money valuation. </p>

<p>If you have a $19m pre-money at seed stage and are looking for an investment of $1m, you are only going to give 5% of the company. </p>

<p>How to retain equity?<br>
Its all about the pre-money valuation.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap as long as possible</li>
<li>Put your own money in</li>
<li>Have some revenue</li>
<li>Produce value, having demand increases your valuation</li>
<li>Negotiate</li>
<li>Get funded from popular investors </li>
<li>Take small investments enough for only a year (If you take a 3 year worth of cash at seed stage, you are probably giving more equity than you should) </li>
<li>I heard screwing over your co-founders help (Imagine Howard owning about 45% at B round)</li>

We don't see a lot of business/finance/MBA guys doing this and when think about it they were explicitly trained to run and grow companies (maybe not start companies but still).</p>

<p>Is there a secret advantage programmers have when running companies?</p>
","<p>I am a computer scientist and someone that was an early employee of a newsworthy startup in my mid-20s. Like another answer said, there is definitely selection bias and reporter bias at work here, and that's probably the biggest contributing factor. </p>

<p>However, the young types that are successful have two other advantages that haven't yet been mentioned:</p>

<p>(1) When you're young you don't know what's impossible. As you get older and come up with ideas, you more easily dismiss them because your life experience gives you a broad perspective on why an idea might not work. When you're young you don't have that perspective and you just do it. When you hit those roadblocks that an older person might have thought of, you either fail or creatively overcome them. Those that overcome roadblocks obviously can reach a point where their older counterparts would not because older folks would not have even started in the first place.</p>

<p>(2) A young person is fresh out of school or still in school. They are learning the latest and greatest technologies, methods, recent research, etc. When they're thinking about ideas their perspective is naturally focused on what's possible with these new emerging technologies because that's all they know. Older folks have to take the time to learn new stuff themselves, if they even have the time. Most of the time we're concerned with leveraging what we already know or leveraging the cumulative effect of what we know, not on new stuff. If you look at the companies who have had young ""geeks"" as founders, they have all leveraged something new, either technologically or conceptually new.</p>

<p>The combination of these to factors gives younger people an advantage. But don't fall for the selection bias -- most still fail, you just don't hear about it.</p>

I use Swift and iOS 8 to develop this application and do not need to use brand new features only available on iOS 8 (like Apple pay, health, etc). <strong>I need to support iOS 7 for certain features and I take roughly 4 to 5 hours each time to adapt my source code to support iOS 7.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I did my research on the internet and found these two following links:</strong> <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/"" rel=""nofollow"">link 1</a>, <a href=""http://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/"" rel=""nofollow"">link 2</a>. To sum up, these two links tell us that currently there are roughly 19%(13% @Late August) of users using iOS 7 and 79%(86% @Late August) using iOS 8. We also know that nearly each year Apple stops supporting one of their devices. Probably the iPhone 4s in September 2015.</p>

<p><strong>I plan to release my application on the Apple Store on September 2015 and the future release of iOS 9 will occur the same month.</strong> I have checked the most famous applications on the Apple store and on average they only target the current iOS version and the current iOS version minus one (which means iOS 8 and 7 at that time), excepted for exceptions like WhatsApp and YouTube which respectively support iOS 4.3 and 6. </p>

<p><strong>If there were only these data to take in consideration, the choice of not supporting iOS 7 would be obvious in my case, but it is more complicated than that because as you probably know the users having the iPhone 4 will not be able to use my application. They will also not be able to upgrade to iOS 8 (Apple decided to stop supporting the iPhone 4 in all iOS versions > iOS 7.1.2), which means they will never be able to use my application if I do not support iOS 7.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The problem is that I have not been able to find global statistics (related to the App Store) where the data is grouped by iPhone devices, which could obviously help me to answer to the question, knowing what exactly represents the 19%.</strong> Knowing that and after having consulted the statistics above, my goal is to target as many users as possible, but the number has to be significant. Moreover I also see that the iOS 8 adoption by users steadily increases month after month.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually I am wondering myself if in my case it worth to spend my time supporting iOS 7?</strong></p>

<p>Note: I guess the wisest decision would be to stop supporting iOS 7 from January 2016 (in a perfect world). Nonetheless I am asking this question to you guys in order to know if it is rational and not dangerous for my future application and business to shorten and thus give up (at least for the moment) the support of iOS 7 and use my time for other things.</p>
","<p>I had a similar experience myself a few years ago when I needed to decide whether to support iOS 4 or not instead of sticking to iOS 5 or more. (I then ruled iOS 3 out due to the lack of ARC.)</p>

<p>The stats at the time were something like 80% iOS 5 / 20% iOS 4, give or take a few percent for older versions.</p>

<p>As you can see, the stats a few years back weren't much different from today's 80% iOS 8 / 20% iOS 7, give or take a few percent for older versions.</p>

<p>And in two years from now, it's pretty safe to assume the ratio will likely be 80% iOS 10 / 20% iOS 9, give or take a few percent for older versions.</p>

<p>The chief reason is that scores of users have a two year mobile plan and change their device every two years by virtue of incentives to either renew with the same carrier or change carrier.</p>

<p>The trend to be on the lookout for when making this decision is whether there's are any serious talk about dropping carrier subsidies on cell phones. As long as they're around in your target markets, you're safe to assume that your client base will be using reasonably recent devices.</p>

<p>(I ended up opting for iOS 5.)</p>

"How to estimate costs for servers for web application?","3937","","<p>Maybe I can find some answers here. How would you estimate costs for a<br>
business plan in context of a web application that is running on a cloud?</p>

<p>Problem is I do not know how the application will technically perform, we have<br>
no prototype yet. At one point we will need to scale...</p>
","<p><strong>Approach #1</strong></p>

<p>I can give you an example, how to estimate the costs for a fictious application, which runs in the cloud (Amazon AWS).</p>

<p>Let's say, there is a device, which regularly sends requests to the server. The server runs in the cloud and needs to process those requests.</p>

<p>Let's assume that the requests are sent every 10 minutes or 144 times per day or 4320 requests per month.</p>

<p>Then, we assume that it takes the server 0.005 seconds (5 milliseconds) to process one request. This gives 0.72 hours of machine time per user per day and 21.6 hours per user per month.</p>

<p>Let's assume we have 10000 users. This gives a total machine time per hour of 216000.</p>

<p>Finally, you go to the web site of Amazon AWS and look up the price per machine hour. At the time of creating that example (months ago) it was equal to 22.2 roubles.</p>

<p>Multiply machine hour price (22.2) by the number of machine hours per month (216000) and you get the total costs of the cloud server infrastructure (4 795 200 roubles).</p>

<p>You can download a spreadsheet with these calculations <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11776689/altruix/additionalMaterials/2014_08_30_profitability_estimate.ods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how assumptions (yellow ellipses) affect expenses and revenue in that spreadsheet.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IzASG.png"" alt=""Assumptions, expenses and revenue""></p>

<p>It goes without saying that you should insert different value into your assumptions to see how the final value changes.</p>

<p><strong>Approach #2</strong></p>

<p>Apart from Amazon AWS, there is DigitalOcean. Here, you pay 5 dollars per virtual machine.</p>

<p>If you can estimate the number of virtual machines (their specs are available on the site of DigitalOcean), you can take the number of required machines and multiply by 5.</p>

"Equity amount for CTO","3356","","<p>I've been working with a business partner on an app. I've decided to come on as CTO, and we're now hashing out how much equity / salary I should get. Here's the facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The CEO has been working on it this entire past year. He's been iterating over his idea and had a prototype developed.</li>
<li>I've been taking $1500/week to freelance for him for the past 3 months under the assumption that I will join on eventually. I'm worth $4000-$5000/week from a freelancing standpoint but took the less pay because I believed in the idea</li>
<li>At my previous startup I was paid 175k + 5% equity. I'm very high in demand.</li>
<li>I'm developing an iPhone app and until I get a developer that means I will be doing the backend and Frontend programming (both of which I'm skilled and experienced in)</li>
<li>The CEO plans on giving himself 55%. His father who has paid for the freelancers that he's hired over the past year will get 20%.</li>
<li>We live and work in NYC</li>
<li>We have a great working relationship. We work in the same office and get along great and are always hashing out ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>He's offered me 8% / 125k. I told him I don't feel like a cofounder at that amount and asked if 15% / 100k was feasible and he didn't think so. We talked for length about it and I feel like I'm worth a lot more than he's selling me on.</p>

<p>Is it fair that he get so much more equity and/or am I being unreasonable in expecting more?</p>
","<p>Here's how equity assignment was explained to me when I was in a similar situation: when starting up, it's reasonable to assign the equity according to how much that person will be responsible for the company's success.</p>

<p>The extreme example would be starting up a new software company with Bill Gates. He does nothing other than put his name on it, while you do 100% of the work and put in all the startup money. He could reasonably expect a HUGE equity stake in the company just because having his name attached will drive sales and ensure success.</p>

<p>In your case, there's the founder (sales and operations), his dad (the money), and you (development of the product). How much do each of you contribute to the success of the company? What would happen without CEO or the sugar daddy? What would happen without you?</p>

<p>What's going to happen if you DON'T come to an agreement? Is he just going to hire another developer or does he need you and you alone? If he finds another developer, what would his expectations be for equity and salary?</p>

<p>So I don't have a specific answer of an exact amount that's fair to everyone. But phrasing the question that way -- ""what's fair to everyone involved?"" is a great way to approach the problem when discussing it with him. It sounds like you're pretty close.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is such a common question here and elsewhere that I will attempt to write the world's most canonical answer to this question. Hopefully in the future when someone on answers.onstartups asks how to split up the ownership of their new company, you can simply point to this answer.</p>

<p>The most important principle: <strong>Fairness, and the perception of fairness, is much more valuable than owning a large stake</strong>. Almost everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong, and one of the biggest things that can go wrong is huge, angry, shouting matches between the founders as to who worked harder, who owns more, whose idea was it anyway, etc. That is why I would always rather split a new company 50-50 with a friend than insist on owning 60% because ""it was my idea,"" or because ""I was more experienced"" or anything else. Why? Because if I split the company 60-40, the company is going to fail when we argue ourselves to death. And if you just say, ""to heck with it, we can NEVER figure out what the correct split is, so let's just be pals and go 50-50,"" you'll stay friends and the company will survive.</p>

<p>Thus, I present you with <strong>Joel's Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup</strong>.</p>

<p>For simplicity sake, I'm going to start by assuming that you are not going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside investors. Later, I'll explain how to deal with venture capital, but for now assume no investors.</p>

<p>Also for simplicity sake, let's temporarily assume that the founders all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at the same time. Later, I'll explain how to deal with founders who do not start at the same time.</p>

<p>Here's the principle. As your company grows, you tend to add people in ""layers"".</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The top layer is the first founder or founders. There may be 1, 2, 3, or more of you, but you all start working about the same time, and you all take the same risk... quitting your jobs to go work for a new and unproven company.</p></li>
<li><p>The second layer is the first real employees. By the time you hire this layer, you've got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers--doesn't matter). These people didn't take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn't start the company, they joined it as a job.</p></li>
<li><p>The third layer are later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For many companies, each ""layer"" will be approximately one year long. By the time your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public or whatever, you probably have about 6 layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is larger. There might be two founders, five early employees in layer 2, 25 employees in layer 3, and 200 employees in layer 4. <strong>The later layers took less risk</strong>.</p>

<p>OK, now here's how you use that information:</p>

<p><strong>The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. Each of the next five layers should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer.</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two founders start the company. They each take 2500 shares. There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half.</p></li>
<li><p>They hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding.</p></li>
<li><p>They hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up.</p></li>
<li><p>By the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively. The earliest employees who took the most risk own the most shares.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Make sense? You don't have to follow this exact formula but the basic idea is that you set up ""stripes"" of seniority, where the top stripe took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least, and each ""stripe"" shares an equal number of shares, which magically gives employees more shares for joining early.</p>

<p>A slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority. Your top stripe is the founders, below that you reserve a whole stripe for the fancy CEO that you recruited who insisted on owning 10%, the stripe below that is for the early employees and also the top managers, etc. However you organize the stripes, it should be simple and clear and easy to understand and not prone to arguments.</p>

<p>Now that we have a fair system set out, there is one important principle. <strong>You must have vesting</strong>. Preferably 4 or 5 years. Nobody earns their shares until they've stayed with the company for a year. A good vesting schedule is 25% in the first year, 2% each additional month. Otherwise your co-founder is going to quit after three weeks and show up, 7 years later, claiming he owns 25% of the company. It <strong>never</strong> makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting. This is an extremely common mistake and it's terrible when it happens. You have these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for five years, and then you discover there's some jerk that quit after two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25% of the company for his two weeks of work.</p>

<p>Now, let me clear up some little things that often complicate the picture.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if you raise an investment?</strong> The investment can come from anywhere... an angel, a VC, or someone's dad. Basically, the answer is simple: the investment just dilutes everyone.</p>

<p>Using the example from above... we're two founders, we gave ourselves 2500 shares each, so we each own 50%, and now we go to a VC and he offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the company.</p>

<p>1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares. So you make another 2500 shares and give them to the VC. He owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd. That's all there is to it.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary?</strong> A lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money saved up, so she decides to go without a salary for a while, while the other founder, who needs the money, takes a salary. It is tempting just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up for it. The trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount of shares to give. This is just going to cause conflicts. <strong>Don't resolve these problems with shares</strong>. Instead, just keep a ledger of how much you paid each of the founders, and if someone goes without salary, give them an IOU. Later, when you have money, you'll pay them back in cash. In a few years when the money comes rolling in, or even after the first VC investment, you can pay back each founder so that each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the company.</p>

<p><strong>Shouldn't I get more equity because it was my idea?</strong> No. Ideas are pretty much worthless. It is not worth the arguments it would cause to pay someone in equity for an idea. If one of you had the idea but you both quit your jobs and started working at the same time, you should both get the same amount of equity. Working on the company is what causes value, not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower.</p>

<p><strong>What if one of the founders doesn't work full time on the company?</strong> Then they're not a founder. In my book nobody who is not working full time counts as a founder. Anyone who holds on to their day job gets a salary or IOUs, but not equity. If they hang onto that day job until the VC puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full time, they didn't take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive equity along with the first layer of employees.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods (patents, domain names, etc) to the company?</strong> Great. Pay for that in cash or IOUs, not shares. Figure out the right price for that computer they brought with them, or their clever word-processing patent, and give them an IOU to be paid off when you're doing well. Trying to buy things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality, arguments, and unfairness.</p>

<p><strong>How much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees?</strong> That depends on market conditions. Realistically, if the investors end up owning more than 50%, the founders are going to feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation, so good investors don't get greedy that way. If the company can bootstrap without investors, the founders and employees might end up owning 100% of the company. Interestingly enough, the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between investors and founders/employees; an old rule of thumb was that at IPO time (when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as you were going to raise) the investors would have 50% and the founders/employees would have 50%, but with hot Internet companies in 2011, investors may end up owning a lot less than 50%.</p>

<p>Whichever way you go in the end, have a proper lawyer check the docs and edit them if needed. It's only a small investment compared to having a lawyer write the docs from scratch. Better safe than sorry down the road.</p>

"Should I include ""salary"" on a budget projection?","2755","","<p>I'm writing a projection document for my startup so I can present it to the investor and show him how much budget we need.</p>

We're projecting it to 6 months, which means the document contains info how how much money we need to develop the project in 6 months.</p>

<p>Should we include that salary thing?</p>
","<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>Every investor I have come into contact with sees this as pertinent.</p>

<p>If you don't have it in your budget, I guarantee someone will ask (if it's a serious startup) - ""Are you guys paying yourselves?"" This becomes a punnet square here: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are paying yourself, and haven't included it, it's very sloppy and unprofessional</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not paying yourself, you better not put it on! (disregard this impossible case)</p></li>
<li><p>If you aren't paying yourself, you'll be asked why. If you need the money, you should include it. <em>This is very important, investors want to see that you can take care of yourself and budget for taking care of yourself.</em></p></li>

"How to protect my idea and code before pitching it","2751","","<p>Are there any safety mechanisms set in place to protect your ideas/code when pitching your startup to prospective funding agencies (e.g., Y Combinator, Techstars, etc) or angel investors?  </p>

<p>I recently heard a horror story of an angel investor promising to invest in a startup company, then after receiving all the juicy details (both strategy and implementation) from the CEO, taking these intellectual property contents to another similar company with a better team and proposing them as his own.  Now I understand that had these ideas/codes been already at least under provisional patent, such a situation would have been less likely to occur (albeit not impossible).  </p>

<p>So my question comes down to: what can I do, as a software developer with a code base and business plan, to proactively defend myself during the pitching process?  Do I have any other weapons at my disposal (besides for provisional patenting of my code implementations and their projected applications in my field of expertise).  I am fully aware that a provisional patent would only secure my claim to the idea/code for 1 year, so I would need to act fast in securing seed funding and rolling out a patent shortly thereafter.   </p>

","<p>TL; DR: There is no perfect solution. Self-funding is mine.</p>

<p>This question comes up all the time. I have been doing this for a while and this is the most difficult part of being a tech entrepreneur. I have yet to find a single, go-to, comprehensive solution for this problem. Every option seems to come with its own unique set of negative unintended consequences. So it comes down to choosing which set of negative unintended consequences you want to live with.</p>

<p>However, since you are a developer, you have one key option that is not available to non-developers. This is the option I have opted for several times myself (as I am a developer too). It is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Go it alone. Develop your product without any outside help and self-fund its development.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The problem with VCs and NDAs</strong>.
The scenario you describe in your OP is definitely a possibility. Many  VCs won't sign an NDA. At least not until they agree to a deal. And by ""many,"" I mean most if not all. If you look around the internet you will find much written about how approaching VCs with NDAs before pitching them makes the entrepreneur seem naive, amateurish, un-savvy, etc. And, AFAIK, VCs have many more pitches than they can read or hear. So they can just move on to the next pitch if you insist on an NDA.</p>

<p><strong>The problem with patents</strong>. The patent field is so technical and complex you really need a lawyer to do it. And lawyers are expensive. And if you are like me, as a developer, you probably have more product ideas than you have time to build them all yourself. So, obtaining a patent on each idea when you get it is... expensive. Probably prohibitively so. Also, I heard somewhere they are no longer issuing ""process patents"" which applies to most software and apps. Although that might be a false rumor. Don't go by what I say here; do your own research. Also, you might already know, the moment you write your code, you receive copyright protection. Your remedy for all IP protection is to sue. Again, expensive.</p>

<p><strong>The problem with partners</strong> <em>this includes co-founders as well as money parters like VCs, seed funders, angels etc.</em> is the potential for disputes about who owns what. Especially if you already have your own code base. I've had a prospective co-founder demand the rights to all the code I have ever written. Obviously preposterous. But in my experience, non-technical co-founders have a tendency to vastly overvalue their contribution and vastly undervalue yours. I think this is because only a developer can know (because you've done it) how difficult it is to develop something, write the code and make it work. Non-developers tend to estimate about 1% of the actual time, effort and knowledge it takes. There's no way you will make up that gap when you start negotiating ownership with a (newbie) non-tech co-founder. Also, if you are smart, you will want to reuse a lot of your code base on your next project. And many more after that. The potential for disputes about this is increased dramatically if you add partners. Even one. Also, at many key points you might have to pivot on your concept or some important element of your strategy or implementation. Again, as soon as you add that second person, you have to get people to agree. That takes time, effort and there is a real cost in potential for sub-optimization or outright company-ending disagreements. Aside: Did you know the number one reason for startups failure is disputes among the management team?</p>

<p>Startups only do two things: product development and sales. Before the product is developed there is nothing to sell. So if your prospective partners aren't writing code, what value do they really have anyway?</p>

<p><strong>The problem with self-funding</strong>. It takes a looooooong time. To build anything substantial. It's hard work and long hours with no immediate compensation. However, I have found it to be worth it. Once you are revenue positive, it will be a lot easier to bring people on board with terms that are more realistic.</p>

<p>The most useful ideas I've found for achieving positive revenue are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need to be full-stack. This includes front-end. I started writing my first app with the back-end first but eventually came to grips with the fact that the user is going to eventually have to interact with the product. Fortunately, last year I stumbled across Polymer (a Google open source project). And an excellent solution for taking advantage of the web-components spec and allowing for front end development to reuse these ""web components"" and focus on only writing what's new for each app. Less than one year in production. Otherwise, a good front-end solution would be even more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>Slow and steady wins the race. Accomplish (at least) one thing per day. When you develop solo and self-fund you enter a marathon not a sprint. Each day of that marathon you need to stay motivated and on track. A technique that has been effective for me is to set a daily goal of accomplishing one major, complex task (or set of tasks) each day with a clear product or deliverable. And I try not to sleep until I succeed. Sleep has become my de facto self-reward mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to work backwards in your design. Hopefully, you have started with a solid core of <strong><em>domain knowledge</em></strong> about the environment your product will be used. How things are currently done in the industry. And what your customers, clients or users will really need. So my trick has been to focus on the user. Understanding them and their needs. Then incorporating all that into the product design and strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Build it first. Customer feedback is invaluable. But they need to see something. Build a prototype. Then start reaching out to customers. If you point them to a nice looking, working app (without all the bells and whistles) you gain instant credibility. They will give you useful feedback that you then recycle back into the product design. Repeat that process until you have something people are willing to pay for.</p></li>
<li><p>Trim out all the fat. Meaning you probably won't need all the features you currently imagine in your product. Identify the essential few. There is a concept called <strong><em>minimum viable product</em></strong>. Look it up. Understand what that means. Focus on your MVP then release something. Add the bells and whistles later in future releases. Product upgrades. Or premium pay services.</p></li>

"What recourse should I offer my client if we expose user data?","2684","","<p>I've developed an app to analyse user data for a client. They've asked me what recourse they will have if the data is exposed (is made accessible to others). I'm not too sure how to answer this question. We've taken the usual best practices with the data: we don't actually store any sensitive information except for their API key which could be used to retrieve sensitive information from their system, the API key is stored encrypted, w/ key rotation, etc.</p>

<p>But it's the internet, even with all the best practices there's always a chance something could get compromised.</p>

<p>I don't really want to go back to them and say they have no recourse, but we're a (very) small operation.</p>

<p>I've looked through some other posts, and references and looked up privacy policies and it seems that as a general rule people don't have any recourse if best practice has been used and the vendor notifies them if they become aware of a breech.</p>

<p>How should we respond? Is there any other kind of recourse that I've overlooked that they would reasonably expect?</p>

<p>We're working with an Australian client but the system is on US servers.</p>
","<p>Data breaches have become extremely common over the last few years with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches"">a massive corporation losing millions of records</a> every couple weeks, on average. While best practices to ensure data security are critical, the expectation that a data breach will happen is now so common that the US Department of Justice took it upon itself to issue <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/speeches/attachments/2015/04/29/criminal_division_guidance_on_best_practices_for_victim_response_and_reporting_cyber_incidents2.pdf"">data breach response best practices</a>.</p>

<p>Any system connected to the Internet will have security holes that can be breached no matter how much effort was made to secure it. (Historically, this is much less true for <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/"">OpenBSD</a>, but I digress.) The most sensitive systems should be the least connected, or entirely offline if that's feasible. There can be no absolute security expectations of any connected system.</p>

<p>So it's best to <s>hope</s> work for the best and prepare for the worst.</p>

<p>Data breach risk, like any other common business risk, can be insured. The risk is now so common, data breach insurance policies have become common. If you search the Internet for ""data breach insurance,"" you'll find many insurance companies interested in offering you quotes based on your business activities. One broker recently told a news publication that policies <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/12/09/security-data-breach-insurance-target/20011477/"">average $2,500 per year but can go up to $10,000 per month</a>. Of course, an insurance company would have to evaluate your particular risks to give you a correct premium that may or may not be in this range.</p>

<p>You should explain to your client the precautions you take to secure their data. You should also explain that there is no security in existence that you or anyone else can implement to fully guarantee the safety of their data. You might explain that you are in the data analysis business and not in the cyber-security risk management business, but that you are willing to work with the client and a third party insurance company to insure any potential financial risks that are of particular concern. You can then evaluate the risks of a data breach carefully with the client and determine if these risks are worth insuring away. Any premium and deductible costs would have to be passed on to your client(s). </p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not you purchase an insurance policy, you should make a plan up-front on how you'll deal with the breach. Know the risks posed by the data being stolen and be prepared to deal with the situation right away.</p>

<p>Lot of opensource projects start out as free so as to gain lot of users and so that creators can get lot of visibility within and outside their company, but when the projects start getting used a lot, many creators start their own companies which now charge money to fix all the problems caused by their opensource projects.</p>

<p>The other thing with a non-MS platform in today's world is that there are just too many choices to choose from esp. on the backend and in big-data processing. You pick anything and there will be some 20+ open source projects/technologies/databases to evaluate. It becomes overwhelming.</p>
","<p>You should choose the stack that your technical team is familiar with. The early days of a startup are not the time to discover new technologies. So if your team comes from a Windows background, stick with it.</p>

<li><p>I am assuming his use of the word <em>sell</em> is an indication of his <em>intention to distribute shares,</em> and <em>not necessarily to put money in his pocket.</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Resume original post:</strong></p>

<p>I was hoping someone else would tackle this one, but I do have some pretty relevant experience as I've had to explain this to multiple investors.</p>

<p>I'll tackle your second question first. Fractional shares are very common, and are allowed under Delaware's <a href=""http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc05/"" rel=""nofollow"">Title 8 Chapter I Subchapter V Section 155</a>.</p>

<p>Now for your second question, regarding accredited investors. For a company incorporated out of Delaware, the three rules for an accredited investor are as follows (I pulled these off a share-purchase agreement form I use)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>earn an individual income of more than $200,000 per year, or a joint income of $300,000, in each of the last two years and expect to reasonably maintain the same level of income.</p></li>
<li><p>have a net worth exceeding $1 million, either individually or jointly with his or her spouse.</p></li>
<li><p>be a general partner, executive officer, director or a related combination thereof for the issuer of a security being offered.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, your question speaks about <strong>the ability to sell shares to non-accredited investors.</strong> The short answer? - <strong><em>Yes, it's possible.</em></strong></p>

<p>I admit I'm not a lawyer (so never take any of my words or references as factual!), but there are two <em>magical clauses</em> I found referenced in <a href=""http://www.startuplawblog.com/2013/01/14/cant-i-let-non-accredited-investors-in-my-round/"" rel=""nofollow"">this extremely helpful article</a>  - <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.502"" rel=""nofollow"">Rule 502</a> and <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/rule506.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Rule 506</a>.</p>

<p>Without going into technical jargon, it is possible, by Rule 506, to issue shares to non-accredited investors, but it must be understood that this comes with a caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[C]ompanies must give non-accredited investors disclosure documents
  that are generally the same as those used in registered offerings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a quick fewnotes about taking non-accredited investment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The company cannot use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities;</p></li>
<li><p>The company may sell its securities to an unlimited number of ""accredited investors"" and up to 35 other purchases. Unlike Rule 505, all non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative, must be sophisticated—that is, they must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment;</p></li>
<li><p>Companies must decide what information to give to accredited investors, so long as it does not violate the antifraud prohibitions of the federal securities laws. But companies must give non-accredited investors disclosure documents that are generally the same as those used in registered offerings. If a company provides information to accredited investors, it must make this information available to non-accredited investors as well;
The company must be available to answer questions by prospective purchasers;</p></li>
<li><p>Financial statement requirements are the same as for Rule 505;</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasers receive ""restricted"" securities, meaning that the securities cannot be sold for at least a year without registering them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I side with Joe Wallin, author of the article referenced at startuplawblog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>...[A]ccepting any non-accredited investors will inhibit your</strong>
  <strong>flexibility going forward</strong>.</p>

"What are the main advantages of starting in Silicon Valley?","2338","","<p>Quite often in articles, presentations or blogs people involved in the start-up scene mention the move of the startup to the Silicon Valley as a big advantage. 
What are actually the advantages of doing this? 
If I'm a UK, German or Dutch start-up with an established start team (founders) why and when should we do this move?</p>
","<p>I've been in the Silicon Valley tech community for over 15 year now so I have an insiders perspective on this.</p>

<p>(1) <strong>Access to resources.</strong> Silicon Valley was built to start startups. The highest caliber engineering talent is here. Early stage and late stage investors are here. Support staff like lawyers and banks that work specifically with startups are here. Conferences and tech meet ups of the highest caliber are here. The wealth of talent and resources is unmatched.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Culture accepting of startups.</strong> Most startups fail. In Silicon Valley that's ok, in fact it's almost encouraged. It's part of the entrepreneurial learning process and fully accepted as normal course. Also, people working in startups tend to work very hard with long hours. This is accepted as part of the culture, and if that's something that you want to feel fulfilled in your life then you are fully accepted.</p>

<p>(3) <strong>Proximity to major partners or potential acquirers.</strong> Google and Apple are in Silicon Valley and they acquire a lot of companies. But there are lots of other companies here as well that could be your partner or acquirer: Yahoo, Salesforce, Cisco, Twitter, or Facebook, just to name a few. As a tech startup you will invariably be working with or relying on technology from one or more of these firms. If you achieve any kind of scale you will have direct relationships with them. </p>

<p>(4) <strong>Proximity to Stanford and Berkeley.</strong> Two of the top computer science schools in the world are in Northern California. This means that there will always be fresh talent, fresh ideas, and access to intellectuals unlike anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The truth is that you can build a business anywhere. There are plenty of outstanding businesses built outside of Silicon Valley and there is absolutely nothing wrong with being elsewhere. Come to Silicon Valley if you want to be deep inside the tech community and be part of a dynamic ecosystem built around starting companies.</p>

","<p>It partially depends on what your business structure is. </p>

You can give off a contagious focus or passion, and can expand your friend circle finding other people that care about the problem.  You may even discover a cofounder along the way.  Meanwhile, think about the people you've encountered and how you can create something to help them.  Think about the simplest and fastest-to-build software features that can truly help them, and how to have people care enough to pay.  Tell the right people in the right ways that they can buy your service, so they're convinced.  And make the software happen.  At that point, you've got a startup.</p>

<h3>Make sure you focus and execute.</h3>

<p>Focus on making the product and sales happen in the most effective way and the rest will follow.  If you don't succeed the first time, go back and repeat some or all of the aforementioned steps.</p>

<p>Competing alone can be done, but is more difficult.  Starting a startup is very time-consuming and requires many sets of skills.  One reason startups have several cofounders is that not all cofounders have all the required skills.  From the way you wrote your question, you seem to be stronger on the engineering than on the marketing, so you may need a more marketing-oriented cofounder.  Or you may need to learn some or all of these skills yourself.</p>

<h3>If you're doing things right, the resources will come.</h3>

<p>In your search, you may discover there are more resources in your university than you thought.  Are there professors, alumni, or even other students who've successfully started businesses, and can help you along?  Do your university's graduate programs, such as the business school, have resources?  However, don't worry too much about what's available in your university.  Just find the resources, wherever they may be.  Are there nearby universities or areas that have an active tech community?  What is in your hometown?  Alternatively, try to get an internship in a vibrant tech center such as the San Francisco Bay Area, New York or London, or study abroad at a more tech-centric university.</p>

<p>The Internet is also a great place to find would-be users and refine your ideas.  You might want to post a separate question on the relevant forum, about whether people would be interested in your proposed software.  Look for an enthusiastic response, ideally one where people have their own (often distinct and highly specific) ideas about how and where they would use your software.</p>

"What does it mean when a CEO sells a part of his shares in a company?","2032","","<p>I have been reading <a href=""http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/jeff-bezos-millions-amazon-stock/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>, where Jeff Bezos sells some of his holdings in Amazon, as stock. So, what does this exactly mean?</p>

<p>My first intuition is that <strong>he is giving away some part of his %age holding in the company to someone else.</strong> Is it true? </p>

<p>If yes, then why is he doing so. By doing so, he's losing a bit of his share in the company.</p>

<p>If not, then where did I go wrong in understanding the article?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>My first intuition is that he is giving away some part of his %age
  holding in the company to someone else. Is it true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CEO is not <em>giving away</em> - the CEO is <em>selling</em> a part of his/her holdings in the company. </p>

<p>The primary reason a CEO does this is for ""diversity"". It's likely that almost all of a CEO's wealth is tied to a <em>single company</em>. That is a bad investment strategy because if, for example, it turns out that Amazon stole Microsoft technology and their stock becomes worthless through no fault of Mr Bezos (assuming that is also true), then he goes from very wealthy to very poor... very fast. Divesting helps prevent this.</p>

<p>Second, he may just need to pay some bills. After all, for a guy worth $30 billion, his $80,000 salary may not keep up with his spending habits. His total compensation is more like $1.7 million. But still, if he decides to spend $10 million on a plane, he'd have to wait a very long time unless he sold some shares.</p>

<p>Third, the CEO may actually be concerned about the health of the company. That's really unlikely because they should probably go looking for another job rather than wait for the company to collapse. If a CEO knows a company has problems, it's best to leave ASAP and let some other hapless CEO take the blame. </p>

<p>Last, sometimes there are ownership restrictions for shares, etc. In other words, the CEO may legally be forced to sell shares in order to reduce their holdings in order to abide by SEC regulations, contracts with other companies, contracts with the government and/or restrictions on the shares themselves.</p>

"Monetizing niche business directory via native app or website","1834","","<p>I started developing a business directory for a certain niche, initially to learn native Android app programming. I have been looking up a lot of businesses on my own and adding to my database.</p>

<p>Later I found out that a business directory app/service for this niche might  provide a lot of benefit to both the businesses and customers. So I thought about monetizing my idea.</p>

<p>For mobile app, I have considered offering lite and full (paid) versions.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking about launching as website but am not sure how to monetize that.</p>

<p>Would you go the website path or the app path to monetize a business directory  (with a lot of data already available)?</p>

<p>If website:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch it with the businesses I have in the database now (maybe with lite versions of their profile data), try to get traffic on the website and then approach the businesses with a paid service for being listed in the future?</li>
<li>Get them to pay for being listed with full information and further benefits?</li>
<li>Or only for being ""Featured"" at the top of the directory list?</li>
<li>Or Monetize by mainly by selling ad space?</li>
<li>Or some other way?</li>
</ul>

<p>Would you launch a mobile version of this site too (maybe responsive)? This might be in contradiction to my original Android app which now is 90% ready?</p>

<p>I would like to bring my idea to a more business level now since I really believe in the chance of monetizing it.</p>

<p>Therefore any advice on how to monetize a niche business directory is highly appreciated. </p>
","<p>The typical way listing services make money is by posting either all or nearly all of the data for free.  You need to attract a lot of users and its incredibly difficult to sign up paid users with a new kind of service.  Keep it free, have them sign up so you can track them and email them.  After a few months you hopefully have grown your user base and now you can add ads to your site, but keep them to a minimum, this way you can try to break even with web hosting costs.</p>

<p>The way to really begin to make money is by signing up premium accounts that want to highlight their listing so they show up on top.  Since its a business listing, they may be more willing to pay than individual users, but I'm not sure about your data.</p>

<p>It sounds tough, but the you cannot try to make much money in the beginning.  Google took away all of Yellow Pages business slowly, and now Google charges a huge premium to businesses for special placement in their results for the different business listings.</p>

"How to handle a partner who's not fulfilling his role","1796","","<p>Let's assume that I (in a hypothetical sense) have an unique idea and my mentor shows interest in the idea and I decide to let him in on it, since he has a lot of experience with start-up companies.</p>

<p>Eventually we start the company and my partner gets a very rewarding percentage of the company, yet my part is greater, since the idea is mine and I've put most of the effort into it. He puts some money into the company to get it going but most of our funding are external.</p>

<p>After a year or so (me and my team, which we hired, have made a working prototype of the system and the development of the actual system is in progress) it turns out that this partnership is not quite working out.</p>

<ul>
<li>My partner is too busy to fulfill his duties at the company (a long time has passed and even after pointing it out to him a sufficient fix it not being made).</li>
<li>My partner is somewhat repulsive towards potential associates, not intentionally though. It's just his character, and well, perhaps he's too focused on bragging about old successes to be able to focus on new ones so that the important chat is not lead into the correct direction. I'm forced to attend critical meetings on my own to avoid situations where he'd partly be making fools out of ourselves.</li>
<li>I feel like there's not much more to learn from my partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>How should one tackle a situation like this?</p>

<p>What if it were someone else, a friend perhaps, who was not fulfilling his role? </p>

<p>Can this situation be avoided?</p>

<p>This is kind of a hypothetical question but partly bases on actual events. I believe this is something that many people will and have come across and I feel like there should be a guideline even though I understand that each situation is unique.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for a too-bread answer but yet one which could cover a few edges of it.</p>
","<p>Any partnership should have a <em>clear</em> legally binding contract with at minimum:</p>

<ul>
<li>Details of expected roles and output/input (ie some partners might only be expected to input capital but others might be expected to put in x hours on x tasks or work on x projects).</li>
<li>Clear money handling including salary</li>
<li>Mutual breakup details: ie what they do if both (or all) partners want to dissolve the partnership</li>
<li>Clear exit clause if any one individual decides they want out so.</li>
<li>Clear clause detailing under what circumstances and how the other partner(s) can remove a partner who is not fulfilling the contract.</li>
</ul>

<p>and on to your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How should one tackle a situation like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have a good agreement with at least what is described above getting rid of a partner is relatively simple legally although possibly emotionally complicated; you just follow your agreement. It would of course be more polite and probably better to have a discussion saying you are thinking about that because you feel the its not working out and see if you can resolve it that way first. </p>

<p>If you don't have an agreement you are basically down to a nice sit down where you explain your position and ask him to adjust his action or agree to dissolve the partnership. If that doesn't work your resulting actions would depend on the partnership laws of your jurisdiction and or legal proceedings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if it were someone else, a friend perhaps, who was not fulfilling his role?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it is a friend the only difference is that there is more emotional involvement. No legal differences. Even if you have an agreement you might decide to handle it differently; rather than relying on the agreement there is probably more likely that you can handle it without resorting to legalese and instead take advantage of the hopefully good communication history with your friend and work it out to maintain your partnership but resolve the issues. If you do decide to ditch them as per your agreement be aware that that could lead to friendship breakdowns depending on how you do it, how the feel and your relationship history. If you don't have an agreement again you have to fall back on the partnership legislation of your jurisdiction and/or messy legal proceedings that may absolutely kill your friendship.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can this situation be avoided?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be made cleaner and dealt with easier but ensure that you avoided entirely? No. The problem is you can't know how a partnership will work out for sure in advance - especially over the long run - just look at divorce rates to see the proof of that. (yes <em>marital</em> is slightly different than business partnership but it has many of the same features). The best thing you can do to avoid it is to make a clear agreement so that everyone knows what is expected of them and makes plans for if there is a breakdown to rectify it as expeditiously and harmoniously as possible.</p>

"I have a great idea, but I'm not great at marketing or sales. How do I approach this?","1713","","<p>I'm a programmer by profession, and I've come up with an idea for a product that I think will do well on the market. The problem is, whilst I'm not shy or anything, I'm not a salesperson either. </p>

<p>I don't feel that I have the skill or ability to market things well, but I'm not sure that my budget will stretch to a full time marketing executive. What are my options, beyond reading up in sales and marketing tactics myself?</p>
","<p>There are 2 steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step One:</strong> Start engaging with a nearby startup incubator. They will help you with the fundamentals and often help with investor and customer introductions. You don't need to apply yet. I'd recommend emailing/calling them and asking to drop in. Or, going to their events.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Start looking for a partner who is interested in managing the business side. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This should be someone you have known for a long time, who has a passion for business. They might be a programmer who is interested in the business end. They must be someone you feel comfortable with.  </p>

<p>There are a few reason:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong>: There are far more success stories from partnerships than from single founders. Think Apple, Microsoft, Twitter. </li>
<li><strong>A startup is tons of work.</strong> Tons. Fundraising alone can be a full time job until you close a round. Unless the plan is to take years to launch, you need someone to manage the load. </li>
<li><strong>Even in terms of programming, you will need to focus 100% on that.</strong> Programming is an insanely time consuming task. </li>
<li><strong>Incubators:</strong> Due to failure and success statistics, most top incubators like YCombinator and TechStars generally do not consider single founder companies. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In terms of protecting your idea:</strong> I am not a lawyer, so please confirm these facts yourself. Laws change all the time. But so far as I know, you have 1 year to patent an idea in the USA after public disclosure. I personally know many founders of multimillion dollar companies who either did not patent until they raised money, never patented, or wasted money on a patent that was not used or strong enough to enforce. Patent enforcement is a whole subject on itself and you can search here for more on it. Personally, I would wait until I had momentum to patent. A lot of people new to business lose tons of money on patents. I made this mistake myself. Lawyers will paint scary pictures. I'd speak to someone at an incubator about your concerns before spending tons of money on patents right away. If you feel you must patent, I would get a provisional patent first which protects you for a short period of time while you develop the idea.</p>

<p>You can find incubators and like minded people on angel.co. Meetup.com is also a great place to find events for startups. Sometimes people there can make introductions. </p>

"Finding a decent development team for my new startup","1589","","<p>My friend and I are working on a social networking app idea, but we both don't know enough coding to develop such a complex app.</p>

<p>We decided to hire a development team of approximately 5-10 developers which has developers for both, frontend and backend development, and also designers for UI design. While I tried to find such a team on oDesk and Elance, I can't trust those people but don't know why. I have a limited budget which is enough for a prototype app and I plan to try to get some investment or loan later on.</p>

<p>Do you know a decent development team that fulfills my qualifications? Or can you give me some advice on what I should do?</p>
","<p>You say you have enough budget to hire 5 to 10 developers immediately. Congrats, that's great news for you and you're asking how to find them. Instead of answering your question directly, I'll go for some observations that I made throughout my (still short but I've been through lots of promising but failed projects and I know exactly why they failed) carrier as a startup developer, then startup CTO.</p>

<p>My short answer will be to give up the idea of 10 people and concentrate every money you wanted to use building such a huge team into building a small commando of 3 to 4 really good people: 2 to 3 developers and one UX designer. <em>Edit: and a QA guy (how could I forget this one).</em></p>

<p>I'll explain why in the steps below.</p>

<p><strong>1. You can't handle 10 developers coming at once</strong></p>

<p>The most important point is <strong>don't hire 5 to 10 developers at once</strong>. You won't be able to manage them and your team will break apart before it has produced any result. Even companies 50 people big go through a lot of pain absorbing 10 developers at once. It's huge. We're talking about strongly opinionated people here (developers) and people who you can't afford to let go during the first few months without putting your whole project in jeopardy. The more people you'll have, the greater the chance that one of them leaves will be.</p>

<p>Building a team takes time and the technical side is just one (almost minor) aspect of the question.</p>

<p><strong>2. But you do need a single point of interaction with your team</strong></p>

<p>Another thing to take into account is, because both you and your cofounder have no solid technical background, you need to have one (and only one) person that you can trust to do the interface between you and the rest of the team. <strong>Otherwise you will get lost</strong> between one person telling you this, one person telling you that, and you won't be able to understand the connections between them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take this simple but concrete example: how does the client side code
  articulates with the server side code in the case when the front-end
  developer needs to make an Ajax request? The back-end guy will want to
  do it one way and the front-end guy another way, and there is no way
  you can arbitrate between the two of them. And if nobody does arbitrate this,
  your code will soon end up being a total mess that nobody understands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In consequence, among the developers you're going to hire, pick one (not the ninja guy, but rather the calm and reasonable guy) and make him your only interlocutor. He will report to you and will held technical responsibility for the team's results.</p>

<p><strong>3. You don't need that many people - in fact it's counterproductive</strong></p>

<p>In a project's early stages, there is not a lot of time available for design and architecture studies. And every developer has their own personal views and beliefs (sometimes almost religious) about what constitutes, in their minds, a <em>good</em> architecture. To avoid disagreements and building an app which will be completely heterogeneous, you have to limit the number of developers that contribute to the early project's foundations.</p>

<p>A modern social web application can be perfectly build with a team of, I'd say, <strong>two to three developers max</strong>. A server side guy (doing Python or PHP or Ruby or which language <strong>he</strong>'ll decide to go with), a client side guy (doing mostly Javascript) and (optionally) a ""browser guy"" (doing html &amp; css stuff).</p>

<p><strong>4. Don't forget the UX guy</strong></p>

<p>Finally, you're only talking about developers but don't forget that an app stands out in front of the competition not because it is well programmed and has a neat code inside, but by <strong>the quality and consistency of the experience it provides to its users</strong>. You definitely need a UX guy.</p>

<p>Plus, you can view this guy as the man who will give your coders the comforting and reassuring feeling that they have a strong and well-defined path to follow along. If you don't have any kind of experimented UX person in your team, your developers (especially the front-end and the html guys) will always work with the impression that they're making blurry stuff.</p>

<p><strong>5. Edit: don't forget the QA guy as well</strong></p>

<p>You need someone to do the testing. I'll point you to <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000067.html"">this article from Joel Spolsky</a> (the creator of this vast galaxy of Stack Exchange sites where you asked this question) to understand why.</p>

"How to start a startup with no cash without taking on debt?","1569","","<p>Lots of startups dream of having a great idea, crafting software for it, going viral and ""some how"" becoming a billion-dollar business. That's great, but I often feel that there's a lot to learn from just running a functional startup.</p>

<p>I realize that this a pretty broad topic, but I'm not looking for a very specific answer, just a general approach on how to start a startup with no money without taking on debt.</p>
","<p>I personally believe in bootstrapping and the ""lean startup"" idea. In other words, start small, and then grow gradually.</p>

<p>Me, I don't care about conquering the world. I just want to solve a problem for as many people as I can without going insane. I have ran a few ventures as ""small businesses"" without having to break the bank.</p>

<p><strong>#1: Freelance Website Developer</strong>
All I needed was a laptop, and internet. I already had a laptop so the only investment was for internet and time to learn and practice.</p>

<p><strong>#2: VoIP Voucher Reseller</strong>
The profit was little, but I was making about $100 per week on the side. Total initial investment was about $200, and the business was self-sustaining.</p>

<p><strong>#3: Frozen Chicken</strong>
Total investment was about $300 for a second hand deep freezer and the first round of chickens. The business was self-sustaining and I was selling about 20 chickens per week out of my dorm room.</p>

<p>These was all small businesses that I ran well, and made good money as a student.</p>

<p><strong>#4: Study Abroad Agency</strong>
Investment was basically for web hosting and internet. The company is in Nigeria but I have been running this from my laptop since 2011... from Cyprus! By 2012 it became serious that I had to incorporate the company in Nigeria as it expanded beyond my expectation.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm quitting my job in Cyprus to return to Nigeria and setup the office and run it full time. The business is worth $700 profit monthly and I would only have to invest about $2,000 to stay lean. However, I'm trying to see if I can raise about $10,000 to setup the office because I want a green office... I want solar panels, as its cheaper on the long run, better for the environment and electricity is shit in that part of town. If I'm not able to raise the money, I would remain lean. (Remember, I've been running the company from my laptop since 2011)</p>

<p>So... these ""small"" businesses are can be scaled to serve even more people and I did not have to take any loans whatsoever.</p>

<p>My advise... start small, then grow gradually.</p>

<p>I started freelance web design first by working on personal projects. I made sure people know what I could do, and soon I was getting paid to do same for others. From 1 website, to 5, and so on.</p>

<p>VoIP vouchers... I started with 5 vouchers (I still remember). The profit was shit! but I was determined to be the main supplier on campus, and I was! I stuck in there with the little profits until I was placing orders 3 times a week.</p>

<p>The frozen chicken required more investment, but again I started small... with 20 chickens. Also, I started with a partner and so all costs were halved. Slow and steady, we went from ordering about 20 chickens a month to 40 or 50 a month. It was good business.</p>

<p>As for Study Abroad, I started out by give advise online on forums for free. My university found out and invited me to apply for agency. I applied and they gave me. I was getting paid to do what I was already doing for free! Again, slow and steady I went from representing 1 university in 2011, to representing 13 universities in 8 countries by 2013, as well as #3 agent in Africa and #2 agent in Nigeria for my university.</p>

<p>So yes, you don't need loans. Start small, start lean.</p>

<li>You <em>are</em> paying them. Equity is pay. It's not cash, and it's more volatile than cash (for better or worse), but it's pay. It's not unethical to give people equity in lieu of cash payments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, like anything, I think the key here is to be clear. Don't mislead potential hires into thinking that they'll make it big next month. But if you're clear about your plan and how you expect to make money, and if you can convince people with the truth, you'll be doing fine. Just try to keep it fair, and you should be alright ethically.</p>

<p>As for the potential awkwardness of offering someone no cash, that can be tough, but I think again the solution is just to be honest. Don't fish for people in hiring pools where they'll require cash, and don't lure people in on the promise of a sustainable young company that's actually only in its infancy.</p>

<p>These days, there's so much excitement around startup culture with developers who see companies like Facebook and Twitter, that if you've got a good idea, you'll probably be able to find someone willing to work for equity.</p>

<p>In fact, in many cases, you'll find enthusiastic people who actually help to shape your company in much more productive ways than someone who's just after a paycheck. That's not always the case, definitely, but it can be.</p>

"Is my LLC required to have a registered agent?","1458","","<p>After registering my small LLC, I signed up for a registered agent service because it is required for businesses in New Hampshire. I later heard that a member or manager of an LLC can also serve as a registered agent.</p>

<p>From reading sites offering these services it seems the main purpose of a registered agent is to receive service of process. That way you won't be embarassed if you are served in front of customers or partners. It's also useful if you can't hold regular business hours. Not having a representative of the company receive service of process could result in your company losing by default.</p>

<p>I'm not worried about being embarassed in front of customers (it's an online business), but is it really risky to be your own registered agent? Would someone really knock once, fail to serve papers, and not attempt to make any more contact? It seems that it's mostly the registered agent services promoting this mindset, so I'm sure if I should listen to them.</p>
","<p><strong>If you want a one word answer - yes, it is required in the state of New Hampshire, in order to receive legal correspondence. It's a communicative requirement. But the position can also be taken on by someone within your LLC.</strong></p>

<p>As listed on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_agent"">Wikipedia page for registered agents</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""state laws vary in how to complete service on the Secretary of State
  and the amount of fees charged. Some of the states that may have this
  statutory provision are listed below. MoRAA eliminated this provision
  but some of the states that adopted MoRAA maintained this provision.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note, the Model Registered Agents Act (read about it on the same webpage), is an</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""effort... to standardize business entity laws as they relate to
  annual reports, registered agents and other laws and forms used to
  file business entities.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In English, this means that the existence of the legal requirement to have a registered agent <em>varies by state.</em> It just so happens that NH (I grew up there!) is on the list of states with the aforementioned statutory provision. For more information about the <a href=""http://www.iaca.org/iaca/wp-content/uploads/MoRAA_Summary.pdf"">MoRAA  read here</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sos.nh.gov/corporate/agentlistings.htm"">This website</a> even features a listing for businesses which can act as registered agents in New Hampshire. You can also find out just about anything regarding business operations in NH at the same website.</p>

<p>To wrap full circle with your question, I found a <a href=""http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/08/you-shouldnt-be-your-own-registered-agent.html"">good resource</a> which shows five reasons why you do not want to become your own personal agent.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The registered agent must have a physical address in the state of incorporation or qualification: A registered agent is required to have a physical address in the state; post office boxes and private rented mailboxes won’t suffice. If you incorporated or formed an LLC in Delaware, but you live in California and your company is physically located in California, this means you cannot serve as a registered agent in Delaware. In this case, you’ll need to use a professional third party as your registered agent in Delaware.</p></li>
<li><p>Your company does business in multiple states: When you register your company to conduct business in other states besides where you incorporated, you’ll need a registered agent in each of those states (unless you have physical offices in each state).</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t maintain normal business hours: The registered agent needs to be available during normal business hours to accept important documents from the state. If you set your own hours or aren’t tied to an office (i.e. you’re a real estate agent or landscaper), you should consider a third party service so you never miss an important communication from the state.</p></li>
<li><p>Your address is likely to change: A registered agent’s address must always stay current in the state records. Any changes to the address require a formal state filing, which is often accompanied by a fee. By using a professional third party service as your registered agent, you never have to worry about updating the state records – no matter how many times you move over the years.</p></li>
<li><p>The registered agent’s address is of public record: Since the registered agent’s address is publicly available, anyone has access to it… including marketers, mailing lists, and spammers. Registered agents often receive unsolicited junk mail for their business. If you wish to keep your company or personal address information confidential, opt for a third party registered agent. You’ll get an extra layer of privacy and won’t have to deal with as much unsolicited mail.</p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>I just would advise against being your own agent since it adds a layer of unnecessary complexity in running your business. As a Chief Operating Officer, I understand that running a business is about simplifying processes and making life easier by delegating out as much as possible to streamline the efficiency. We have a registered agent. It works.</p>

<p>Regarding your fear of them abusing the system with their tactics like ""better answer or be ready to face consequences"" - it's totally valid that this may be misleading, but at the end of the day, many companies thrive on this fear of instability, and this is just another case in point where I wouldn't want to be caught on the wrong side off the fence.</p>

"Can I convert ordinary shares into preference/redeemable shares?","1455","","<p>I am setting up a company with a few friends but we would like to rope in an investor. We have subscribed some ordinary shares which we can obviously afford to pay for.
Now we need some extra money and we thought we can convert our ordinary shares to preference/redeemable shares and offer them to the investor at a higher price.
Is this a legal /accepted method that other startups use out there? If this is not allowed (converting ordinary to preference) what other way can I approach this?</p>
","<p>Your question is really very region-dependent, as there might be huge differences between different juridictions. Even in one only country (the US for example) each different State will have a different view on that matter. You have not told us what is your incorporation/creation region, so answers can only be generic.</p>

<p><strong>Preferred Stock</strong></p>

<p>In most jurisdictions I know, you are free to issue different classes of shares (given that you have a company that is divided in shares, would it be a Delaware Corporation, an Uruguayan or Panamenian or Brazilian SA, etc.) Common shares, as the name states, are the ones that most of the regulations and rights and obligations are made for. You can also, again depending on your laws, issue preferred shares, that can usually have many different ""classes"" within. Within each class of the preferred shares you can specify different rights or obligations that are specific to that stock type. So like it is usual in Brazil (my country), preferred shares here commonly have no voting rights in the assemblies, and, as such, cannot exercise any kind of control. But they have priority in dividend distribution and usually have a higher dividend rate than common shares.</p>

<p>The idea of having preferred stock issued to investors is that you give them some special rights within their class of shares. I have seen preferred shareholders have the sole ability to chose the CFO of a company, for example, so even if they only hold the minority of votes, they can still exercise a lot of power in what it is important to them.</p>

<p><strong>Converting Common into Preferred Stock</strong></p>

<p>It is usually possible to convert common shares into preferred shares (again, depending on your local laws!), as long as you manage to have 100% approval of all shareholders in a corporate assembly. And that is also true for the creation of the preferred class, which has to be done before converting the shares.</p>

<p><strong>Issue of New Preferred Stock</strong></p>

<p>But, that is not really what I think you want. If that common shares have already been issued, and are currently owned by you (the founders), if you convert them into preferred and sell them to investors, then the money would go into your pockets, not into the company. Because you already own the shares, so you are selling something that already belongs to you. No serious investor will put money into your pockets instead of into the company in an early stage company, which is always hungry for resources. This is called a <em>cash out</em>, as you are really selling part of your ownership in the company.</p>

<p>The thing I suppose you want to do is issue <strong>new shares</strong> so that the investors will buy newly issued stock from the company and as such the money they put in will land as capital for the company, not money in your pockets.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do, again, is to approve the creation of this preferred stock class, then define the special rights of that preferred stock class, then you have to issue the stock to the investors directly, and they will put the money in the company's bank accounts. But that process is usually only started <strong>after</strong> the negotiation with the investor is in advanced stages, because many of the rights they demand will be subject to the negotiation between you two. What you need to be ready for is to create this class and accept that investors will demand some rights that common stock will not have.</p>

<p><strong>Higher Value of Issued Stock</strong></p>

<p>If you want to sell the share you already own, you can just charge any value the other side is willing to pay, as this is your property and in free countries you usually have no regulations on what you can sell anything you own for.</p>

<p>When you issue new shares, you usually can issue them at whatever value you wish. In some jurisdictions, Brazil for example, you need to account the emission in two different accounts. One of them is the ""Capital"" account, which is the account that holds the ""property"" information so the value contributed by each shareholder to this account is what really represents the ""owned fraction"" of the company. And the remaining of the value goes into another account called ""Goodwill premium in share emissions"", that does not count towards property/ownership representation.</p>

<p>For example if you already have $100,000 in 1,000 shares outstanding, previously issued and paid for, so you have $100,000 in the Capital account. Each share was issued at $100. Now you want to issue new shares at $200/each, because your company is in another phase and valuation is higher. For each new share costing $200, $100 will be added to the ""Capital"" account and the other $100 goes into the ""Goodwill premium in share emissions"" account. That Goodwill account will hold the difference between your lowest priced share (the first ones you issue usually) and the prices charged for every other share you issue.</p>

<p>This is what is required to issued shares at any value <strong>in Brazil</strong>. Each jurisdiction will have its own rules. A local accountant will surely know how to do that in your jurisdiction.</p>

"How should a small web development startup handle an online only customer that stops communicating once the bill is sent","1436","","<p>Generally for online only clients I provide a maximum of 2 hours work before requiring at least the initial payment. However for some clients that is the total amount of work (or more) in some of those cases I have had clients that stop communicating as soon as the bill is received. I am located in Canada some of my clients are located in the US (but they could be pretty much anywhere).</p>

<p>I don't have a deal with any debt collectors and I suspect that may be not very effective for recovering small amounts (less than $75). I generally do still have access to the hosting/FTP/webadmin for the client. So my question is kinda three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I hire a debt collector?</li>
<li>Should I put up a notice blocking their site until they pay? (ie I have the ability but are there any legal problems with doing so? (given that I have a papertrail showing an unpaid bill)</li>
<li>Is there something else I should do or should I just write it off?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Regarding your question and not your proposed answer, I would communicate relentlessly but very politely.  After all, your desired end-state is a satisfied paying customer who repeats business and refers others.  If the customer is happy with the service but has been (literally) embarrassed for funds, consider simply forgiving the debt.  It sounds small, and while you are a hungry startup, the fact that you are a startup means you are hungrier for a loyal customer base than for mere cash.  Customers bring cash and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Ask if there is any problem with the service.  Ask if the customer would like to change anything about the agreement.  Ask if the customer needs some additional time to pay.  Finally, offer to forgive the debt if it means keeping a paying customer who needs to not pay one time.  It just happens to be the first time, and from then on, you would have no trouble asking for payment up front.</p>

They want meeting after meeting and they call all the time. In essence they are getting a lot more of my time than they signed up for (and paid for).</p>

<p>The best I've been able to come up with is to explicitly state that the contract includes a certain number of client meetings, and that additional meetings can be arranged at my hourly billing rate. But I'd love to hear other options. What legal and ethical responsibilities do I have?</p>
","<p>I would definitely suggest considering dropping the client altogether (just trying to plant the seed of thought if you haven't already popped out of the rabbit hole).</p>

<p>In growing your business, you state</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""they are getting a lot more of my time than they signed up for (and paid for).""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As others are discussing, there is a lot of talk about a contract. Everything about your question seems to fall back to the existence of this contract (by what you've stated using the words ""signed up for"" I'm assuming there is already some sort of contract in place. Thus, your <strong>legal</strong> commitments or responsibilities are likely outlined in any sort of contract you have.</p>

<p>As for <strong>ethics</strong>, I also want to suggest that you clearly communicate your concerns with your client. It is important to establish a good image in every business practice you do - it is very important long term to maintain positive relationships, as you never know who each of your clients is networked with (this pertains to <em>lost -- or potential --</em> clientele in your imminent vicinity).</p>

<p>I'm just suggesting that you consider removing them as a client - it may hurt your business if you appear weak, but meanwhile you want to maintain a positive relationship. You obviously got into this deal because at some point you saw it to be advantageous, so my first suggestion would always be to try and repair it - however in this case it seems you aren't happy with the situation, and that you've already gone through the <em>'how to fix this client relationship' stage</em>.</p>

<p>Just make sure to <em>differentiate</em> your legal and ethical responsibilities. There may be a choice that is best to make ethically (or personally), but you may be bound in different verticals that you may not have as much control over.</p>

<p>Also, would love to enhance my answer if you were to share more (legally sharable) elements of your contract.</p>

"Lean Canvas vs Business Model Canvas vs Custom Canvas","1419","","<p>My understanding is that these frameworks for modeling business models, per their creators, have always been intended to customized as need to the circumstance presented.</p>

<p>As an example, I recently ran across someone using Ash Maurya's online version of the Lean Canvas and they were using it to model a hobby project; meaning revenue and cost were at best minor concerns.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the most common models and is there a framework for creating custom models based on the circumstance that are presented?</p>
","<p>TL;DR: IMO the Lean Canvas is better for new startups, whereas the Business Model Canvas is better at a later stage. Both frameworks are made to be 'customized'.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, the two most popular business model frameworks are the Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder) and the Lean Canvas (Maurya). The main difference is that the Lean canvas substitutes 'Key Partners', 'Key Resources', and 'Key Activities' with 'Problem', 'Solution', and 'Key Metrics'. That substitution becomes highly relevant for a brand new startup - or even merely a supposedly identified business opportunity - because it focuses on the highly proclaimed problem/solution fit as a part of the Customer Development philosophy advocated by Steve Blank and many other scholars and entrepreneurs. Because the business model of a new startup is most often based around assumptions, it can make more sense to 'guess' the problem and the solution to that problem - and then validate/iterate/falsify your guess in the field, talking to real customers. Since a problem/solution fit is essential to building a startup in the first place, it makes less sense to hypothesise the key partnerships and activities, because these most likely only become relevant if the startup is solving a problem in the first place.</p>

<p>However, for larger businesses, or startups that have successfully found a scalable and repeatable business model, may benefit more from the Business Model Canvas, since the partnerships, activities, and resources suddenly becomes much more relevant.</p>

<p>Both frameworks are flexible in the sense that you can add elements that might have a special significance for your type of startup. My personal opinion is that the Lean Canvas is the best place to begin (watch this video, and you'll have your canvas done in 20 mins <a href=""http://spark59.com/leancanvas/20-minute-challenge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spark59.com/leancanvas/20-minute-challenge</a>) and if you want Maurya's own words on his motivation to alter Osterwalder's canvas in the first place, look here: <a href=""http://practicetrumpstheory.com/why-lean-canvas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://practicetrumpstheory.com/why-lean-canvas/</a> </p>

We are expecting a decent amount of users using it after just the first month. We have not registered the company name yet.</p>

<p>My question is, before releasing the app, should I get a patent, trademark the name or copyright the name? Or is it best if I do all three?</p>

<p>I was going to trademark the name but I'm not sure if I have to get a patent for it as well.</p>
","<p>You can't patent or copyright a name.</p>

<p>There are four relevant types of IP.</p>

<p><strong>Patent</strong></p>

<p>When we think of patents, we generally think of utility ones, so I'll focus on that. A utility patent is on a process or invention, in essence. A patent gives you the right to say, for twenty years, ""hey! I came up with that invention, so you aren't allowed to perform it without paying me."" The gist behind a patent is that the government wants you to share your inventions, and in return, they'll help you stop anyone from stealing your ideas out from under you.</p>

<p>An example of a patent might be a chair. You could get a patent on a seat with four legs. Similarly, you could get a patent on using a certain algorithm to accomplish a certain task</p>

<p><strong>Trademark</strong></p>

<p>A trademark is just what it sounds like. It's protection for a <em>mark</em> that you use in <em>trade</em>. That's where your name would come in. You can trademark a name or a logo, and that holds other people from using it as well. Trademarks are meant to protect consumers. In other words, if I started sowing basketball attire and selling it with the NIKE logo, that would probably be pretty confusing to consumers, and it would be detrimental to NIKE if people bought my product and found it to be low-quality.</p>

<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>

<p>A copyright is on <em>artwork</em>. Artwork is a broad term, as it can include drawings, music, architectural designs, really prettily written C++ code, or just about any other purely-aesthetic thing. The idea of a copyright is to just stop other people from copying you. If you draw a picture you really like, you probably don't want someone else photocopying it and selling that copy, and having a registered copyright would protect you from that. You do get implicit copyrights on any artwork, but you'll need to register them before going to court.</p>

<p><strong>Trade Secrets</strong></p>

<p>I know you didn't mention this, but it seems like good measure to include. A trade secret is never registered with anyone and is exactly what it sounds. You have some intellectual property--say, for random example, the Coca-Cola recipe, a very famous trade secret--and you don't want anyone stealing it. Rather than depending on the government to give you a license to it, you simply don't tell anyone. The only form of measurable protection granted by a trade secret is that if anyone breaks confidence and tells, you can sue them. Of course, that's rarely of particular use once your competitors know your secrets.</p>

<p>Another classic example of a trade secret is a client list.</p>

"Tech startup - Ask shareholders to commit to project to prevent losing equity?","1342","","<p>We are working on a shareholders agreement for a technology startup. We have all shareholders having the same equity. Is it a standard thing to have something in the shareholders agreement that will cause a shareholder to lose his equity if they no are longer interested to work on the project?</p>

<p>In order to build the product and start the business, all shareholders are required to invest their time and do a significant amount of work. We have no investors, i.e. shareholders that would get their equity by putting money or something else then their own time and work into the project.</p>

<p>Now, here is an example of undesirable situation. Say we work together for couple of years and then, for whatever reason, one of us won't be able to continue. Others will still have to work hard to keep the business running and growing. </p>

<p>Does it make sense that the one who stops working (not temporarily, like for couple of weeks, but permanently) on the project loses his equity at some point (after some time, or over the time, or alike); or does it make sense that this shareholder will continue to keep his equity (forever)?</p>

<p>We have two opinions in the team. One is that the shareholders should never lose the equity regardless of how much they contribute. The other is that without such a motivation, if someone stops contributing, the whole project inevitably dies or has to be sold because all others will lose their motivation (why would you want to work to earn money for someone else who has the same equity as you and does nothing anymore...).</p>
","<p>There are two types of risks that you want to cover in the shareholder agreement:</p>

<ul>
<li>One or more of the founders decide to stop for any reason and move on to another project.</li>
<li>One or more of the founders are not pulling their weight or don't get along with the others, and the others decide to get rid of them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vesting is your friend</strong> as already stated. More often than not, that'll mean a 4-year vesting period with a one-year cliff - i.e. if you part ways before a year you get nada.</p>

<p><strong>But vesting is not good enough</strong>. Picture yourself working hard for almost a year, getting the boot shortly before you vest (it happens...), and learning later on that your former colleagues strike it rich with you having nothing to show for it. You want the agreement to protect against that too, so that it's fair for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>To cover the latter edge case, also <strong>include a founder salary</strong>. It gets paid in the form of an IOU until the company can (if ever) backpay those salaries. Likewise for expenses - if a founder throws extra money to the pot to purchase, say, a copy machine, they get an IOU in return (rather than extra shares) if the company can't cover the expense.</p>

<p>Further, <strong>make this IOU a senior debt</strong> to avoid dirty tricks between ex-cofounders: should the company ever raise money, the funds should cover the former cofounder IOU balances before they can get used for anything else. That way, former cofounders can't get screwed over by accounting tricks.</p>

<p>Suppose, for the sake of keeping things simple, that there 480 shares per founder, a vesting period of 4 years with a one year cliff, and that each gets $5k/month (plus interest).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If all goes well, everyone gets 120 shares after year one, and 10 extra shares per month for the next three years. And in case you're not breaking even yet, the company also owes everyone $60k worth of salaries (or the balance thereof if they got paid).</p></li>
<li><p>If one of the founders leaves after 6 months for any reason, they get zero shares and $30k worth of salary as an IOU (or the balance thereof if they got paid).</p></li>
<li><p>If one of the founders leaves after 18 months for any reason, they'll have earned 180 shares and $90k worth of salary as an IOU (or the balance thereof if they got paid).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In all three cases, the IOUs will only ever get paid if the company turns a profit or raises money down the road.</p>

<p>Last point that you want to have in mind as an aside: <strong>worry in advance about hostile dilutions</strong>. It unfortunately happens: long-gone founders sometimes get screwed over by their former partners, with the latter adding money to the pot at a low valuation so as to dilute their former partner's shares into nothingness. To work around this, require 2/3 majority for fund raising rounds, make it so that all existing shareholders get <em>notified</em> long enough in advance when they occur, and make it so that they're all entitled to participate in any such round at that round's valuation.</p>

"What does it mean when companies raise 'x' amount at a 'y' valuation","1342","","<p>I am in the process of opening up a company (one that is limited by shares) and I'm trying to get familiar with a lot of terms.<br>
What does it mean when companies and startups decide to raise money and in <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/27/airbnb-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">this case of AirBnB</a> how does one interpret such statements and how can I value my company if investors decide to buy some shares from my company?</p>
","<p><strong>First part: what does it mean</strong></p>

<p>These two pieces of information determine the total amount of money that has been (or will be added) to the company (your 'x' value) and the 'y' represents the value attributed to the company at the time 'x' was raised. With 'y' you can tell the fraction of the property of the company that was (or will be) given to the investors in exchange for them investing 'x' in the company.</p>

<p>The common name for your 'y' is <em>pre-money valuation</em>. Pre-money because it was the valuation given to the company immediately before the money influx.</p>

<p>As a real example, if a company raises US$100,000 at a 1 million pre-money valuation, it means that the company will receive 100,000 in its bank accounts and the investors that transfer the money will receive 10% (100,000/1,000,000) of the ownership of the company in exchange. So <em>post-money</em> or right after the investment, the company will be valued at US$1,100,000, the pre-money valuation plus what was invested in that round.</p>

<p>Valuation changes following the life cycle and stage of the company, and will, if all works out as expected, raise with every new investment round. First rounds (like acceleration, angel, seed) will have substantially lower valuations than later rounds (VC round A, round B, round C, round D, round E). You can usually determine the current stage or phase of the startup from its valuation.</p>

<p><strong>Second part: how to determine valuation</strong></p>

<p>Now for your second question, how do you determine your company's valuation, that's a real hard one.</p>

<p>No conventional valuation method fits the Startup ecosystem. I have spent a great deal of effort reading and examining the best works in asset valuations (the bible written by Damodaran for example) and they just don't fit a Startup. That happens because of the uncertainty and high risk, so no real planning and cash flow projection will ever be correct. Or even close to being correct.</p>

<p>So the Startup ecosystem developed its own methods. And unfortunately it is very hard to give you a specific answer, because they all depend a lot on what is your company businesses, and where in the world it is located.</p>

<p>Some of the names you can search to help you are ""Dave Berkus method"", ""Venture Capital Method"", ""Score Card Method"" and ""Risk Factors Method"".</p>

<p>I had little time to search for previous answers to this second part of the question on startups.stackexchage, but you can probably find more about it already here. If not, please formulate another question because it will be a long answer and it deserves to be in a question of its own, for future reference.</p>

"What is a fantasy name? How does that work?","1341","","<p>I've heard in some occasions about a term: Fantasy Name. But I don't know what is that.</p>

<p>So, if I'm opening an start-up do I have to choose both Name and Fantasy Name for it? What are the differences? Can any of them be not unique among all companies in the world?</p>
","<p>A Fantasy name is made up name (ie fantasy) with no real world meaning. This can be handy as it reduces your chance of name conflicts, and enhances recognizeability - like for example will you recognize Jo's Software or Jobondare more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do I have to choose both Name and Fantasy Name for it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No; all you have to choose is a name. That name <em>might</em> be a fantasy name but you only are choosing one name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can any of them be not unique among all companies in the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly but not required nor guaranteed. There is no global registrar of corporations; most companies are registered on a provincial/state level and at that level most often there are restrictions to prevent similar names. Fantasy names have a slight advantage there since more often than not they will be unique unlike for example 'Victoria Shoe Repair'. </p>

<p>Depending on trade treaties and a <em>LOT</em> of legislation and relative ages of companies and amount of legal clout (ie money to burn) a company may be able to effectively have a unique name on a global scale; but in most cases you really don't have to worry about that.</p>

"Is unlimited pricing a bad idea?","1250","","<p>I have a SaaS that lets people extract data from movies. It is resource intensive and the more amount of work they bring the more it will cost me in terms of time, working with them, and etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>With respect to your pricing strategy, Matthew has already expanded on the case for <em>per movie</em> pricing, so I won't elaborate on it any further than saying that if your variable prices are high enough, you should very seriously consider it.</p>

<p>What I'd like to focus on is your marketing, because you're giving the impression that your prices are too low: you absolutely <em>need</em> to segment and understand your users. Note that what follows might invite you to refocus your efforts and cater to an entirely different set of users. </p>

<h2>Segment your users</h2>

<h3>Which of your users are valuable?</h3>

<p>Identify good client segments: those who actually need your service and are more than willing to pay for it. Identify bad client segments: those who are wasting your time and resources, or inundate you with support issues, while providing little material benefit on your end.</p>

<p>(Don't discard word of mouth as an upside. Hobbyists that bring near-zero profit might be talking about you every day in forums. In fact, you might even want a <em>free</em> tier for that reason alone.)</p>

<h3>Bad client segments</h3>

<p>The bad client segments will often have this in common: they perceive your full service as something they're entitled to while paying little or nothing. It is easy enough to handle on paper: erect enough of a price or feature barrier that they won't come.</p>

<p>Consider whether any or all of them can be salvaged before executing this. How big a price increase or feature decrease will make it so that they become worth your time?</p>

<h3>Good client segments</h3>

<p>The good client segments will often have this in common: they perceive your full service as valuable and well worth their money. If told to jump as a group, your best clients are those who will want to know: ""How high?"" What you need to determine from there is: how high <em>can</em> they jump?</p>

<h2>Define and price your tiers</h2>

<h3>B2B SaaS products are often underpriced</h3>

<p>Keep in mind here that scores of B2B SaaS products are woefully underpriced. More often than not, they charge <strong>pocket change in comparison to the salary of the employees</strong> in charge of making use of it.</p>

<p>The reason is, they're typically run by engineers who forget to hire a marketer very early on. The engineers end up setting the price <em>they</em> would pay, which is to say roughly zero -- it's ""just time."" (If you need an example of how ludicrously wrong they can be, recollect how techies laughed at Dropbox on grounds that the same can be set up for yourself using OSS and some duct tape.)</p>

<p>(If anything, a better pricing strategy for many a SaaS startup would be more along the lines of: What's the highest figure we can think of without laughing out loud saying it? The price elasticity is quite flat.)</p>

<h3>Identify the upside you deliver</h3>

<p>Now, ignore your SaaS competitors' prices for a moment.</p>

<p>Can your good clients even do what you're offering without your service? If so, think in terms of cost savings: how much would they save by extracting the same data using alternative DIY solutions. If not, think in terms of added value: what financial benefit do they get from using it?</p>

<p>Is their financial upside $1 per movie? $5? $10? $50? $100? More? Ask them.</p>

<p>Price your higher tiers accordingly. And no, by all means, don't offer unlimited plans if your variable costs are anything material.</p>

<h3>Segment tiers by requirement</h3>

<p>Your tiers should additionally reflect who they're catering to. What does a typical hobbyist need? A small business? A medium business? An enterprise?</p>

<p>Slice the tiers, with seats, features, number of movies, value-added services, and so on accordingly.</p>

<p>The cheapest plans should only be acceptable for a hobbyist or a client that rarely needs your service. The largest plans should give no second thoughts to clients that constantly need your service and derive well understood value from it. Again, make sure you <em>do</em> understand this value.</p>

<p>A hobbyist or a small business here or there needs more than what's in the plan? Cool: they'll get a larger plan. Or go elsewhere -- and cost your competition money.</p>

<h3>Avoid the wholesale price trap</h3>

<p>Lastly, be wary of the wholesale unit pricing trap as you price higher-end tiers. With appropriate enough added-value with each tier, decreasing the per unit price can make very little sense. Yet again, be aware of <em>what</em> that upside is from the client's standpoint.</p>

<h2>Compare with your competition</h2>

<p>Only then should you consider what you're up against in terms of SaaS competition. Compare the offers <em>from the viewpoint of clients that you actually wish to close.</em> Do NOT do feature to feature or price vs price comparison. Think of yourself as your target low-, mid-, or high-end SaaS buyer, and wonder if you'll get the <em>value</em> that you're looking for with yours vs theirs.</p>

<p>Tweak your tiers if applicable, keeping in mind what you offer that they don't and vice-versa, the quality of your respective services and onboarding experiences, and -- most importantly -- how compelling your respective marketing copy and sales arguments are (e.g. <a href=""http://close.io/#pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">excellent</a> vs <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/crm/editions-pricing.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">terrible</a>.)</p>

"What Is The Need Being Met By Airbnb","1244","","<p>Several answers here point to finding a customer's <em>need</em>. How do we precisely define what a need is? Taking airbnb, the model I'm closely modeling, people traveling do need a place to stay, but there's was already numerous hotel options. I like the business and it was fun to use it to stay on a sailboat when I had a conference in Portland. But I didn't need to use airbnb to find place to stay. </p>

<p>Also, presumably the sailboat owner didn't need to rent it out to keep it. But even if she did, does a need on the supplier side even count?</p>

<p>So what are the needs being met by airbnb in particular?</p>
","<p>This is a very interesting question. Forewarning, there will definitely be an amount of personal opinion I reference here, but it is my experience and I believe it to be valid.</p>

<p>You're talking about the classic problem of improving a service. As humans, we've been inventing and improving our lives for centuries. </p>

<p><strong>Ask yourself this one question - what would happen if we <em>never re-invented the wheel.</em></strong></p>

<p>Personally, I didn't know much about Airbnb except that they were basic travel rental locations. A short big of research leads me to their slogan</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start Your Adventure </p>
  
  <p>Discover destinations that travelers love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The need here that was not being met could have been a variety of things, but most likely was the unique services in each location. This was confirmed when I tried to click a listing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Airbnb, you can find unique accommodations in people's homes—from
  houses and apartments, to tree houses and igloos. The listing details
  below explain what you'll find in this space. If you have any
  questions, you can contact the host directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, Airbnb prides itself on <strong>unique, creative travel lodging</strong> that really gives the traveler a dive into culture with a sense of security and reliability. You get to see how people live in different cultures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems to me Airbnb is somewhat of a <em>luxury good</em> - meaning <strong><em>people might not need it, but they want it badly enough to pay for it as if they needed it.</em></strong></p>

<p>I hope that addresses your question. Luxury goods can often be harder to think about, given that people don't really need them (I mean, <em>come on, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism"" rel=""nofollow"">commercial flights to the moon?</a></em>), yet they still can be actively traded as if they were necessities.</p>

<p>From the startup sense, that's about as far as I need to go, but you may want to look into some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods"" rel=""nofollow"">economic theory</a> if you want to learn more about the behavior of different goods.</p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently Airbnb also operates to reduce the costs between the home space seller (getting cash for unused space) and the costs paid by the person looking for a place to stay. In that sense, it's taking the concept of <em>arbitrage</em> and giving a smaller margin (the big companies love big margins!) such that everybody is still happy (except for the big companies, clearly).</p>

<p>This is the same concept as being used by the crowd-sourcing taxi services (like Uber and Lyft) - effectively causing the same damage with the large-margin security of taxi drivers.</p>

<p>In reality, though, it's competition at its best. Play the game or become useless. <em>Or complain to the government until they make an extremely poor decision to prolong a bad system</em>).</p>

"Can I try to get investors without a prototype?","1230","","<p>Is it a good idea or a waste of time to try to get investors for the start of the prototype creation, when the project is only on paper?</p>
","<p>There are a few things in play:</p>

<p>Who is the investor, and what is there risk tolerance? An active angel investor will likely have a higher risk tolerance than someone used to investing in businesses that are already profitable.</p>

<p>The complexity of your proposed product/service will come into play as well. If your plan would have been fairly simple to prototype and you haven't done it, they will wonder why you haven't yet and trust you less to work with their money. If it's fairly complex and/or costly to prototype, it will be easier for them to understand why you're asking for funds first.</p>

<p>How well can you demonstrate, without having gotten to the point yet where you have a prototype, that you know this business inside and out, you know how to run a business period, and you will effectively use the funds they're potentially giving you?</p>

<p>Do you have any past experience with a startup (maybe even in a similar market?) that you can leverage to make this deal more appealing?</p>

<p>How good of a salesman/negotiator are you? Do you have a great pitch for this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Ultimately, a prototype would be a significant asset in pitching your business. It shows that you're taking this seriously and likely have at least some understanding of the business itself to have gotten that far. So if you CAN do a prototype before asking for funds, you'll be in a much better position during negotiation.</p>

<p>Anything you can do to lower the risk to their investment is going to make the deal more appealing.  But under the right circumstances, (and offering the right amount of equity, etc) the risky deal can still be appealing (and sometimes risky is even more appealing than safe as long as it's risky for the right reasons) because it has a higher potential gain to go along with the higher potential risk.</p>

"How should I account for waste?","1206","","<p>In a small (hobby stage) business, how should I account for waste?</p>

<p>I'm buying my raw materials (fine lumber and other stuff) under a sales tax exemption (state of Texas, Travis county 8.25% total rate.) So I have to account for how it's used (sales are taxable, disposed of is not taxable, other uses become taxable.)</p>

<p>I'm trying to do accrual accounting, where I take material off the inventory account at cost and move it to finished goods.</p>

<p>However, there is a sizable amount of unusable product that I dispose of. Maybe 25% at worst. (Obviously I'm motivated to reduce that!)</p>

<p>To simplify finished goods inventory, I'm using an internal transfer price that assumes no waste in making the product.</p>

<p>To balance the books, I intend to take inventory periodically and create a ""plug"" entry:</p>

<pre><code>Book Value of Raw Materials - Internal COGS - Plug = Value of actual inventory
</code></pre>

<p>The plug would be waste.</p>

<p>Suppose I purchased $1000 in lumber to make 20 products, then my internal COGS is $50 each; COGS being cost of goods sold. Now suppose the lumber is used up, and there are only 15 finished, salable products. My Inventory account had $1000 in it. I drew down $750 while using up all the raw materials, so my plug would be $250.</p>

<pre><code>$1000 - $750 - $250 = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My state sales tax would be based on revenue from in-state sales of finished goods plus lumber removed from (sales tax-free) inventory for other uses. So my accounting setup helps answer the question: what is my sales tax base. But I would also put the Waste  entry into my COGS account.</p>

<p>I expect to reach $3000 in sales this quarter for the first time, so I'm trying to do this right before filing taxes.</p>

<p>Is this a good way of accounting for my inventory and waste? What are some problems with it and ways to do it better?</p>
","<p>Any cost incurred in production of a product must be matched with the revenue from it as closely as possible. Therefore typically waste gets factored in the COGS. That way your COGS would represent your true costs and shows you how you can increase profit by decreasing waste. </p>

<p>So your waste ""plug"" entry would be part of the COGS account. </p>

<p>Imagine a carpenter requires 9 feet of a 2x4 for a product. His supplier only sells 10 foot 2x4 so he buys them. For each product he has 1 foot left over which he cannot use in a product and assuming  he cannot make money selling them as scrap. He would therefore assume that each product uses 1pc of 10 foot 2x4 in his books and that would be in his COGS. That 1 foot was waste is typically an operational measure and not an accounting measure unless it is assigned a salvage value afaik. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how it's used (sales are taxable, disposed of is not taxable, other
  uses become taxable.)</p>

<p>The list goes on - just curious if anybody has some data about usage. Thanks.</p>
","<p>At this stage of the business you're looking for Early Adopters. Few agencies specialise in those, and when they do, they're usually insanely expensive, IME. You're usually better off identifying these people yourselves, using in-house staff - people who will become your in-house media communicators. The role that these people will often fulfil is sometimes called a Growth Hacker, sometimes a Tech or Digital Marketer and sometimes a Social Media Marketer.</p>

<p>IME, the best bang for buck for exposure comes from the network you already know. If you're deep into a topic area, you know people. You know the people that know people, and you follow people that are influential. Get on their radars and ask them to help spread the word. Then find more people like the new joiners. It should, done right, cost less than any advertising that makes the same impact. This changes at scale, when advertising becomes useful.</p>

<p>Email is often barely discussed, but for many startups that I've worked on, it has been far and away the highest impact and lowest cost mechanism to reach interested users, engage them, and get their networks to engage. That's not using email spamming, but using the network of interested people already connected to to you - and growing that.</p>

<p>I have worked as a Growth Hacker and trained them, and I have also spent budgets of up to US$0.5M/month on AdWords. I have some evidence behind this... Personally, I don't spend on  standard advertising systems (Facebook, Twitter, AdWords, LinkedIn, etc) unless I can justify to myself that emailing the network is not going to deliver lower cost results. IME, that scales to somewhere around 10k's of users, depending on the type of product (might be much smaller in B2B or niche B2C products).</p>

<p>But the general technique should be to understand who your audience now is, how they communicate their enthusiasm to others, and helping them to communicate by giving them the material that stimulates them to do so. That may be email announcing changes to the product, new things, special offers - depends on what it is you're doing, and what they care about. Engage with your network - that's usually, IME, the key to early explosive and low cost growth. Don't be afraid to change the mechanics later. </p>

"Understanding a SEC Form D","1128","","<p>Let's say in section 13 of an SEC Form D, a company lists its total offering amount as $1,000,000 while they only list $750,000 as the amount sold and the difference is listed as a remaining amount to be sold. </p>

<p>Does that mean the company closed a $1,000,000 funding round or does that mean they attempted to raise $1,000,000 but only actually raised $750,000? The Form D was filed a month ago so I think it's possible the funding round isn't complete yet? What happens if there are no other investors to complete the round (i.e. do they need to reach the entire offering amount)?</p>

<p>I'm looking for any information related to what the Form D actually means in terms I can understand, unlike the SEC's documentation.</p>
","<p>See <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.503"" rel=""nofollow"">Rule 503</a>(a)(1):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An issuer &hellip; must file with the Commission &hellip; Form D &hellip; no later than 15 calendar days after the first sale of securities in the offering</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, on to your questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Does that mean the company closed a $1,000,000 funding round or does that mean they attempted to raise $1,000,000 but only actually raised $750,000?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter.</p>

<p>Suppose that, on November 1, ABC Inc. offers $1m of shares for sale under Regulation D: at this stage, it has no obligation to file papers with the SEC.  A week later, on November 8, it starts to receive acceptances to its offer&mdash;shares are beginning to be sold: it now has 15 days to file Form D.  Even if waits the full 15 days, it may still find that the full $1m is not completely sold by that point; so at the time it is filed, the form might depict (as you describe) $750k sold with $250k remaining to be sold.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>The Form D was filed a month ago so I think it's possible the funding round isn't complete yet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entirely possible.</p>

<p>However, it's also possible that the remaining amount was sold <em>after</em> the Form D was filed.  Note that Rule 503(a)(3)(ii)(F) makes it explicitly clear that the issuer does <em>not</em> need to file an amended Form D in this case.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>What happens if there are no other investors to complete the round (i.e. do they need to reach the entire offering amount)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the offering can be withdrawn without it having been fully subscribed.  Those who accepted the offer will have the shares that they bought and the company will keep the proceeds from those sales&mdash;it simply won't have sold as much as it had liked.  That said, some investors may only provide ""conditional acceptances"" that indicate that they will only buy the shares if a certain amount of investment is raised.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the company may decide to continue the offering until the full offered amount has been raised.  No time limit is imposed, although under Rule 503(a)(3)(ii) an amended Form D will need to be filed if the issuer originally indicated that the offering was not intended to last more than a year (Item 8) but that has since changed; and under Rule 503(a)(3)(iii) further updates will need to be filed annually thereafter until the offer is withdrawn.</p></li>

<p>I was told by a good friend to start putting projects up on Bit Bucket and invite him to do code reviews and guide me in good directions. Sounds good, but is this a good way to build a team fast?</p>

<p>How can I grow a big team of developers on a project with little to no money?</p>
","<p>Well, there is one quick, honest, and real answer I can give to your question ""how to build a team of developers with little to no money.""</p>

<p><strong>You don't.</strong></p>

<p>99% of the time, it doesn't matter what your idea is. Most people can come up with good ideas, but it's execution that makes an idea stand out. I've once read an article that talks about success, but basically it's a 80/20 relationship between execution and the idea itself.</p>

<p>That being said, you had stated your goal was to use <strong>little or no money</strong> to get <strong>software developers.</strong> Reminder here - programmers -- especially good ones, understand opportunity cost well, and it's nearly impossible to sway a good programmer (the one you'll need) to work for you on equity alone. In his or her mind, they would just ask ""why not just do this myself?""</p>

<p><strong><em>You have to bring something stellar to the table.</em></strong></p>

<p>Hate to burst your bubble, but here is what I consider stellar.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Amazing financial packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Promise of future success and reward</p></li>
<li><p>An incredibly good work environment that goes with either of the above bullets.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's just the reality of building a team.</p>

"How many hours per week does a startup founder work?","1064","","<p>I know it's not the ""real question"" it's not how much time your work, but how much is done, but I'm still curious. (And probably others are as well)</p>

<p>To my surprise I didn't find a similar question on this site.</p>

<p>Do startup founders usually (as in, not when there's a rush) work on Saturday ? On Sunday ?</p>

<p>How many hours do they work on an average day ?</p>

<p>I've heard 18h, from the founder of airbnb (ok, tried it. From a health point of view. It doesn't work)
The founder of Wufoo said 8-10 hours, 5 days a week. Which seems a bit low.</p>

<p>I personally do 12+ hours a day (including quick meals, so more like 11+) and work most Saturdays as a half day.
It is average ? Am I a lazy founder ?</p>

<p>Again, I know it's not a deep truth about your startup, but I'm curious.</p>

<p>So, how much did <strong>you</strong> work in the early days ?</p>
","<p>As a startup founder, you should have your startup and 1 other thing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Startup + games + gf/bf != well</li>
<li>Startup + hobby + games + gf != well</li>
<li>Startup + gf/bf = well</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that whenever you are not doing your hobby or spending time with your family etc you should be thinking about your startup/your project. </p>

<p>This doesn't mean force yourself to think about your startup all the time. This means that you are so excited that all you can think about is your startup. So, don't force yourself to work 18hrs or 10hrs a day, work as much as you feel like.</p>

<p>There is no optimal, it differs from people to people.</p>

"What happens to convertible debt when a startup fails?","1063","","<p>Many investors seem to be offering ""convertible debt"" investments. Without going into too much detail as to what it is, what are the ramifications if a startup fails? Are the founders personally responsible for paying off the debt? Both theoretical worst case, and practical outcomes would be handy.</p>
","<p>Ah, convertible debt. The magical structure of pre-seed startups.</p>

<p>I just had a meeting on this a few months ago, as one of our investors really pushed us to let him invest using convertible debt. Just some quick background on convertible debt for those who don't know:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's better for most investors because of tax loopholes</p></li>
<li><p>It's better for founders because of the goal of 'losing less equity' and allowing the founders to keep control (at least until later rounds).</p></li>
<li><p>It's generally converted over a long course of time, and is one of the least-high impact forms of investment (often small amounts of capital over a long period).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, as for your question, the key word here is <em>liability</em>. For the rest of my answer, I'll be referencing an <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/159520"">article by Entrepreneur</a> that addresses your question directly in its third point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three critical decisions to make when using convertible
  debt:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>What will be the event that triggers the conversion? You can elect to specify an event (or set of events) such as a revenue threshold, a
  financing threshold or another business milestone. Typically,
  entrepreneurs and investors agree to set the conversion to occur at a
  financing event.</p></li>
  <li><p>Will there be a discount upon conversion? It's a tricky decision to provide a discount to early investors. But if you don't provide a
  discount or set it too low, you might not get investors to commit
  before the next round is close to fruition. And if you set the
  discount too high (or if takes a long time for you to raise the next
  round and you don't place a limit on the discount), the next round's
  investor will factor in the discount when pricing the stock.
  Effectively, this may mean that you--the entrepreneur--will pay for
  your generosity out of your own shares! Be wary of this.</p></li>
  <li><p>What will happen to the investment if the conversion event doesn't occur? If the debt is set to convert to equity when you raise $10
  million, and if this never happens, what should happen to the initial
  investment? It could remain as debt. Or you could elect to add a
  clause that allows the debt to convert to equity at the discretion of
  the investor or the discretion of the company.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>To boil it down, using the convertible debt method of financing with
  family, friends and angels essentially boils down to you saying, ""I
  need money, and you have it. <em>But I don't know how much my company is
  worth</em>, so let's see if professional investors or the passage of time
  will set the value for us while giving you an upside that's more in
  keeping with the risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In plain words,</p>

<p>The contract is king here. You want to logically iterate through all possible outcomes with your investor, and talk about the liability. Depending on your business type, you may be liable to pay the debt if your company accrues it, but <strong>more than likely, your investor doing convertible debt will be <em>friendly</em> and you should try to agree on giving them equity if the company fails</strong> (they lost their money - it's a gamble, they'll understand - as long as the odds were good in the beginning). Good luck.</p>

"Pros and Cons of using source control as an independent entrepreneur","1059","","<p><strong>Take the following scenario;</strong></p>

<p><em>You are a solo entrepreneur with two years of programming experience in C# but with no knowledge of using Source Control.
You have an idea to develop a product for small businesses and currently only have a small budget.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Would it beneficial to use source control software such as Git in this
  situation or are the advantages of using a service like this only fully
  optimized when dealing with a team of developers?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source control, like all new things, takes time and a potentially steep learning curves to master. There are a number of open source software's that can be used which can minimize cost but as the old saying goes, ""Time is money"". </p>

<p>Although new to the entrepreneurial scene, one areas that I have seen that is given a lot of emphasis is the time at which you take your product to market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Could taking on the task of adding source control potentially mean you
  spend less time on developing and fine tuning your product and
  therefore miss your best opportunity to go to market?</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>What are the Pros and Cons of using source control in this situation?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any personal experience or suggestions would be much appreciated. </p>
","<p>I'm going to try and pull out some business reasons for adopting source control, rather than focus on the technical goodness:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It reduces time to market.</strong> As others have pointed out it makes moving back out of mistakes much easier. As others have pointed out it makes finding bugs simpler. For much the same reasons it makes making trying experiments with the code much easier too. You can try something and trivially change your mind with zero risk of you missing something and fouling up your codebase. All this together means you can move faster and deliver earlier.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic business safety.</strong> Having everything in hosted source control helps solve your backup / business safety issues. The lack can actually affect business insurance payout stuff (via the same sort of basic precaution clauses that mean you don't get payouts for theft if you forget to switch the alarm on and leave the doors unlocked). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Helps with legal claims.</strong> Having everything in source control, tracked, backed up, etc. is a safety net in the unlikely event of claims of IP theft, etc. It's an auditable record of what you did and when.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It makes it easier to scale your team.</strong> At some point you're going to need to pull in other developers. At that point source control is vital for folk to work together effectively. So you're going to want to be proficient before you hit that point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It will help developer recruitment.</strong> Not having source control is going to make you appear unprofessional when recruiting. For many people (myself included) source control is at the ""washing hands before food prep"" level of basic practices. Back in the day when I did contract dev work one of the first questions would have been about looking at your repository. The absence of one generally have me disengaging from the client because if they're not doing the basics right…</p></li>

"Excellent user feedback but sales still low, what am I doing wrong?","1045","","<p>I developed a <a href=""http://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap"">desktop application for Windows</a> and I'm now trying to sell it.</p>

<p>User feedback are excellent, I receive encouraging emails from user saying that they have been waiting a tool like this for years, but the sales remain low (less than 10 sales per day).</p>

<p>I have a free version for personal use only, with some limitations, and a paid version that costs $9. The differences between the two versions are explained here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nurgo-software.com/pricing/aquasnap"">http://www.nurgo-software.com/pricing/aquasnap</a></p>

<p>According to Google Analytics:</p>

<ul>
<li>28% of the visitors download the free version (about 100 downloads per day).</li>
<li>2% of  the visitors purchase the paid version (less than 10 sales per day).</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that I need to do some advertising, but my first attempt with AdWords has been a waste of money.
I tried search ads and display ads with very limited results. For now I targeted only US.
I also tried YouTube ads with the video that you can see on the product home page. 23% of users watch the video, which seems not bad, but it don't generate enough sales to be profitable.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?
What actions should I take to improve this?</p>
","<p>I only looked very briefly at your site, but based on the question I think you're on the right track and just need a nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p>The good is, you're actually measuring and you know your conversion rates: 28% download the freebie, and 2%, which is to say 7% of the latter group, purchase it.</p>

<p>The bad might be that you aren't aware of <em>why</em> these conversion rates are occurring. (There's also a typo in your price list: ""Strandard"" should be ""Standard"".)</p>

<p>At any rate, before you waste any more money on ads, try to figure out the <em>aha!</em> moments related to both conversion rates -- and optimize accordingly.</p>

<p>With respect to your current approach:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Which specific features are the ones that make things tick and prompt visitors to hit the download button?</p>

<p>(Your download rate, by the way, is already high by some standards. But you never know -- there might be some wiggle room to improve things regardless, or at least some insights to gain.)</p>

<p>Experiment with your sales copy to determine this. Either use the same copy for all visitors for a day or two, or a different copy for a certain percentage of users for a few days in a row. The idea here is to collect a reasonably meaningful sample.</p>

<p>Try to identify which features and parts of your landing page are most important or can be improved: try changing the feature order, try hiding some features, and so forth. Which one makes them go straight for the download button? Is it dynamic layout? Window snapping? Window stretching?...</p>

<p>While you're at it, review the other elements of your landing page. Does watching the video yield more conversion or less? Would a different video improve things? Does the page convert better without the video? When it's to the left? To the right? Would there be room to try to capture the emails of your visitors? And so forth.</p></li>
<li><p>Which specific features <em>actually</em> turned out to be useful, and interesting enough to prompt a sale?</p>

<p>Determine which set of features the users run into before they buy the software.</p>

<p>Can they temporarily try all features in the free version to get a feel of the difference?</p>

<p>Assuming you need to enter some kind of API key that unlocks the app, or that the app monitors for updates, you can do this while calling home: track which features got used during the first day, during the first week, and before entering an API key.</p>

<p>Your goal here is to try to locate patterns: if users have a higher conversion rate when they've used one or two particular features, you want to know about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, provide an animated intro/welcome screen upon completing the installation.</p>

<p>It should deliver clearcut, to the point instructions, and a picture or animation (the ones on your site should be good enough).</p>

<p>The point here is, walk new users into trying and using the features that will maximize the probability that they'll open their wallets.</p>

<p>Allow users to opt out of this onboarding, of course -- most will go through it if it's short and entertaining.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While you work through the above, also ask your existing users and clients: What was the tipping point for them? What made them want to try the product? What made them want to buy it? Don't do this using a web-based survey. Have a chat with a dozen or three of them instead -- by phone or Skype, to keep things interactive.</p>

<p>While you do this, try to figure out <em>why</em> they needed the product. What pain point did it solve for them? Can you identify patterns in there? As in, some work in very similar niche markets, or needed it because of some very specific piece of software and a very specific feature or two made a world of difference, and so forth?</p>

<p>Once you get a very good sense of the precise problems that they're trying to solve by purchasing your product, you'll be ripe to retry ads. Because, you'll have a much better understanding of what is going on in a potential buyer's head vs a freebie user's head, and therefor why you should target some keywords but not others -- and with what teaser.</p>

"What are the consequences of a holding company owning a startup?","1037","","<p>Say someone were to have a holding company, we'll call it Holding Labs, that owned a startup company called Startup Inc. Holding Labs is a software company whose business model is to hire web development talent and acquire server assets, and start many separate web companies using that same talent and resource pool. This company would be the one paying the employees and owning the assets.</p>

<p>If the founder of Holding Labs wanted to start a particularly exciting web company, let's call it Startup Inc, and wanted to open it to outside investment, would venture capital groups or other investors be deterred by that ownership scheme?</p>

<p>If investment money originally coming from Startup Inc was used to grow the talent and resource pool of Holding Labs, would that be illegal? Or frowned upon?</p>

<p>If Holding Labs' founder owned 80% of Holding Labs, and Holding Labs owned 60% of Startup Inc, would that effectively mean the founder couldn't exercise majority control of Startup Inc?</p>

<p>What are the consequences of an arrangement like this?</p>
","<p>Interesting and complicate question.</p>

<p>In the eyes of investors, particularly Angel Investors, the Team is probably the most important part of any startup. In your configuration, the Startup Inc. would have no team, it would be merely a project in the Holding Labs portfolio. A project that, depending on Holding Labs' other projects, will receive attention and resources from Holding Labs, or not.</p>

<p>Also, the person of the Founder holds great importance in every startup. A Founder is someone with the passion and the view to make things happen. A startup with no clear Founder figure might just fall into the complicated aspects of ""ownerless"" projects so common in big companies. Maybe will even turn out to work as a department, with all the down sides of internal politics and else. Eric Ries in his ""Lean Startup"" (the current Tech StartUp Bible IMHO) addresses internal structure issues, and clearly states that hierarchy is an energy and resources drain that should be avoided at all costs in a startup, which, almost by definition, does not have resources to spare.</p>

<p>Even worse would be to use resources invested in Startup Inc. as resources for Holding Labs. That would be a huge red flag for investors. Not illegal, but most investment contracts will clearly state that all the money invested must be used to grow the company they invested in. Growing another company, <strong>especially the owner</strong> is a definitive no-no. There is a huge conflict of interest in this configuration, which will surely damage the investors.</p>

<p>I do not consider Startup Inc. to be a good investment target for investors, <strong>but</strong> Holding Labs might be! Holding Labs will have the team, and the team will be used 100% of the time to grow the best project that Holding Labs has at any particular time. As such, the conflict I described earlier won't exist.</p>

<p>Now as for the control question. If Founder A controls Holding Labs and Holding Labs controls Startup Inc., as seems to be the case on your question, then Founder A has indirect control of Startup, Inc. He has control, nonetheless.</p>

<p>Think it like this: Founder A has control of Holding Labs. As such he can force Holdings Labs to do whatever he wishes (lets consider that there are no agreement, by-laws, legal or articles of incorporation restrictions). Then he can force Holding Labs to vote as he wishes. But given that Holding Labs' vote controls Startup, Inc. (again considering no restrictions), then Founder A can define how Holding Labs will conduct Startup, Inc.'s businesses and, as such, holds control of Startup Inc. itself.</p>

"Is it risky to use a non .com domain?","1005","","<p>I've noticed many tech startups using the <a href=""http://www.nic.io/"">.io</a> domain. Many more <a href=""http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings"">TLDs</a> will be available in the next few years. Using a less popular domain gives you more freedom to choose your name, but does it make it harder to find your site? If so, how can one minimize the negative impact of using one of these domains?</p>
","<p>As much as we'd like to believe otherwise, the vast majority of internet users automatically think .com even if they should know it's .net .org or .vegas</p>

<p>This has gotten better as more TLDs have become common in recent years.  Aside from tech startups using them,  I think people seeing t.co fb.me and goo.gl  (not to mention bit.ly and others) links showing up in the social media feeds is going a long way towards getting people used to the idea that it isn't always .com</p>

<p>That said, I think we have a little while to go still before typing in a url like: www.spinozis.pizza will feel natural.</p>

<p>It's impossible to say how long it will take before these new TLDs (or the older but less common ones) become more common place. Part of that will depend on how many larger companies are willing to take the risk of jumping on board with the new opportunity.</p>

<p>Luckily, a tech startup has a larger portion of their userbase that is more likely to be familiar with the new TLDs than Spinozi's Pizzeria is likely to. So do you risk alienating those that aren't ""in the know"" to get a cooler domain name?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is one you'd have to weigh case by case. Just how cool is the name? Is it catchy enough that it will make the TLD more memorable too? How lame is the alternative .com domain name that you're considering?  How important is it to your brand to have a catchy domain name?</p>

<p>If possible, I would say the best case scenario for now, if you want to use a new TLD, would be if you can work it out to get the catchy TLD domain <strong><em>and</em></strong> the corresponding .com domain.</p>

<p>Examples that come to mind are bit.ly (who also use bitly.com) and delicio.us (delicious.com as well).  Neither of those are actually ""new"" TLDs, but the new ones haven't been out long enough to have many (any?) really established new brands using them (and many of them aren't even released for registration yet).</p>

<p>As things move forward with more and more of these being used, I don't think it will take too long before people become fairly comfortable with them. And the more comfortable people become, the less it will matter what TLD you use for your domain.</p>

<hr>

<p>Something else to consider is how people are going to interact with your site.</p>

<p>If it's something they stumble into from a search engine or a link on another site and only visit it once to download something or install an app or whatever, then the domain isn't as critical for them to remember exactly how to type it in (unless they need to tell their friend how to get their).  But if you want them to come back and visit frequently, it needs to either be really catchy or .com (or both obviously).</p>

<hr>

<p>Another detail that makes it matter less is that many people have a habit of typing things in the search bar instead of the address bar even if they know the url.  I've even seen people type ""google.com"" in the Bing or Yahoo search bar in their browser.</p>

<p>If they do that, and your SEO is up to par, they shouldn't have trouble finding you even if you're using an off the wall TLD. </p>

<p>Between those people, and the people that are already knowledgable about the TLDs, a large portion of your user base may already be able to find you with a new TLD - it's just a matter of determining if it will effect the rest of your potential user base and if so is the fancy domain worth the risk?</p>

"Methods for choosing a business name","959","","<p>I am trying to be a bit scientific when choosing a company name and created a survey structure to test different names. I aimed to make it short (only 7 real questions) while testing the main criteria I have for picking a name.</p>

<p>Do you think this <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/8FDPGSC"">survey</a> has a suitable template that would provide me with data to cover the most important criteria for deciding upon a brand name:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spellability - so potential customers can type in the domain</li>
<li>Memorability - so can tell friends about the company</li>
<li>Meaningful - a clue about what the company does</li>
<li>No inappropriate associations - does not provoke thoughts or images of competitors or contradicting domains e.g. a rhubarb-harvesting company name should not make you think of children's toys</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I applaud your impulse to make name choosing systematic. And I'm not going to quibble about criteria - though I'd say in general it's easier to set negative criteria (screening for cases where names are going to get you in trouble) than positive ones beyond your first pair (a memorable name that's easy to spell right first time you hear it and say right first time you say it).</p>

<p>Seth Godin tells a great story <a href=""http://j.mp/sethgodin15"">here</a> about naming, and I like his method, not as the right answer for all occasions, but as a good way of getting to a workable name. His point is that while (probably) all reasonable length English words you might like aren't available at reasonable price in the .com, something magical can happen when you take two English words that makes sense grammatically but don't normally go together. You get memorability when seen or said, spellability and readability for free (as long as you screen out cases where the letters give unhelpful letter combinations and ambiguous word breaks). Meaning you don't get, though in your sense (a clue) you absolutely could, if that's what you want.</p>

<p>OK, so I've gone near your question, now I'm going to get closer in.</p>

<p>Most names I know that have been built on frameworks you suggest have been corporate, and they've been chosen to cover situations like mergers or international expansion, where a name change may be seen as advantageous. One famous example was Consignia, a name that was a wonderful choice against most criteria, and <a href=""http://j.mp/consignia"">an abject failure where it mattered</a>. So yes, Accenture is here to stay, but it took huge marketing spend to establish it.</p>

<p>So finally, could a survey help, and is yours well-structured? Well, if you want to check your assertion that a given name meets specific objective criteria, it absolutely makes sense to ask others. But regarding the more objective criteria, I would suggest giving it to people you know, because you aren't looking for the wisdom of the crowd, just a check.</p>

<p>If you're with me on the small sample approach, then I'd further suggest that you test the parts that require sound (someone speaking the name to test how it's heard, or the other party being asked to pronounce a name they've only just seen) live, whether face to face, by phone or with a hangout. When surveys contain more than text, a lot of noise goes in via the content (an audio file or video, say) and the mechanics (a listen button or viewing screen), which means that to achieve significance is time, resource and quite possibly cash intensive.</p>

<p>Good luck. I'm intrigued to see what's behind your appy ideas! </p>

Most app developers might be able to write code in all of iOS, Android, Web, and server as long as you give him some time in a small company, but is that also true of hardware engineers? In other words, how is it possible for people who build a Nest product to also build a tablet, headphone, or an air-conditioner?</p>

<p>Also, how many people are required to build hardware? Is it possible to hire only one, talented engineer and let him do everything? I think that the job of hardware engineers is prescribe how to build it, and the actual people who builds it are employees of companies like Foxconn, right?</p>

<p>Lastly, I've even considered enrolling at an university again to learn about it myself. There are some departments that seem relevant, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and materials science and engineering, but which one is the best to enroll in? Are the resources learned in universities enough to leg up building the hardware?</p>

<p>Forgive me if some (or all) of questions above are ridiculous, but I have no knowledge in hardware...</p>
","<p>I want to establish something here, because I think there is a fundamental flaw in your thinking.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You say you want to hire a hardware engineer to build some hardware-related product.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm led to believe you must know at least something about hardware in general, or at least enough that you have interest and enough specific understanding to see some market need (although I don't see any direct evidence of the latter in your post).</p></li>
<li><p>a.  More directly - you're clearly establishing you also <em>lack</em> some fundamental knowledge to get the product built: </p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>""but I have no knowledge in hardware""</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>b. Yet you clearly want to act as the founder (this point goes hand-in-hand with item #2).</li>
</ol>

<p>These being said, I want to pose the question: <strong>Are you really in the position to start this company by yourself?</strong></p>

<p>From my understanding, you need to find your own personal value (and be very affirmative with it) before finding a co-founder with a hardware background. It's probably been brought up on startups before, but <a href=""http://www.codeventures.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">codeventures</a> is a great resource for finding a technical co-founder.</p>

<p>In other words: You speak as if you need to hire an employee, but what I believe you may need is a founder of high expertise who is capable of hiring employees, if it is necessary. Otherwise, you will have no way to measure the success and progress of your employees, since you lack the knowledge you're looking for.</p>

<p>I just want to make sure you know what you're getting into before developing a hardware product. Some major questions to consider, since I don't know your present state of knowledge:
  -  Is the product <em>realistic</em> (economically and physically)?
  -  If you don't have the knowledge to confirm both of these, do you at least have a valuable reason to believe <em>someone</em> does?</p>

<p>You need to answer both of these realistically to move forward with your idea. </p>

<p>Furthermore, as for your schooling, you will be better off focusing on either <em>education</em> or <em>work</em> - never try to do both successfully, because in the end, both will probably suffer if you don't manage your time extremely well.</p>

"UK Accounting: How to account for initial funds","949","","<p>I'm a software developer, not an accountant.</p>

<p>I've just created a LTD company, and I'm about to make my first deposit of cash into my new company bank account.</p>

<p>How should I record this for book keeping purposes - where does it go and what is it listed as, do I have to reclassify the Shares recorded at companies house (currently 1000 shares at 0.001). Is it 'Shareholder funds' - I have no idea!</p>

<p>Such a simple question seems hard to find an answer.</p>

<p>** Although I've accepted the answer below - I've successfully accounted for this transaction as a 'Directors Loan to the company', which makes me a creditor. I then account for this with 'creditors falling due after a year' counterbalancing the cash in bank **</p>
","<p>Your double-entry journal will obviously show a <strong>debit to cash</strong>, but you are asking <strong>where to book the corresponding credit</strong>.</p>

<p>If you pay-up the money for your 1000 shares (of 0.1 pence nominal value each), that £1 would be credited to <strong>share capital</strong>&mdash;but where should any further funds be credited?  The answer is that <em>you have a choice</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You might decide to subscribe to the shares for <em>more than their nominal value</em>, in which case the excess (over the nominal value) would go to <strong>share premium</strong>.  This is pretty straightforward and the only formality would be to keep records of the transaction.  Note that you cannot decide at a later date to change the value at which you subscribed to these shares&mdash;it is a one-off decision.</p></li>
<li><p>You might decide to allot yourself further shares, in which case the nominal value would be credited to <strong>share capital</strong> (and any excess, as before, credited to <strong>share premium</strong>).  You would need to check the company's Articles of Association for authority to undertake such a task (but if you are the sole director/shareholder of a company with model articles, you won't have a problem) and then record the decision in the relevant minute books, together with filing the relevant forms at Companies House.</p></li>
<li><p>You might decide to <em>loan</em> the money to the company, in which case the credit would go to <strong>shareholder loan</strong>.  There are complicated rules around this, both from the perspective of thin capitalisation (to protect creditors) and from the perspective of transfer pricing (to protect the Exchequer with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses for the purpose of corporation tax)&mdash;I strongly recommend you obtain advice from an accountant before proceeding down this path.</p></li>

"What incentives can you provide to potential employees when you don't have any money?","930","","<p>Let's say I am creating a piece of mobile software and I need another developer and artist to work on it with me.  Assuming they are willing to work for compensation that is not immediate, what are my best options for these employees?  </p>

<p>Off the top of my head I can think of only two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ownership in the company</li>
<li>Guaranteed portion of potential profits / revenue</li>
</ul>
","<p>I think partial ownership is your best bet. I know you listed that, but I think that's the best thing you can offer. People these days--developers in particular--are so excited about start-ups, because we've seen companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and all those get so big lately. So if you can find people who are as enthusiastic about your idea as you are, they'll gladly hedge that bet and go for equity.</p>

<p>You could go with something like ""free service for life!"" but that's not likely to attract much attention from most developers.</p>

<p>Given that, your goal just becomes building an environment of morale and excitement for the future. That can be easier said than done, of course. That sense of security and morale is also easier to maintain, I'd say, once people are truly comfortable with the idea and progress you're making. This will sound stupid, but I'm a proponent of internal branding: get mugs and pens made with your logo. That will help your employees feel like the brand means something and that you'll be around for a while. It's a cheap investment on a sense of security.</p>

<p>But really, the driving force behind most start-ups is passion. You just need to find people who are passionate about your idea, and that's a difficult task. But if you can find people who are super excited about what you're putting out, they'll most likely be enthusiastic about any equity offer you throw them, because they'll agree that your company is going places.</p>

"Questions I have to ask when hiring developer","905","","<p>When I hire a developer online, I get a lot of applications. Of course, most of them have a good cover letter and his previous work which looks good. So I always ask some questions for the developer to answer when applying. I'm curious there are good questions to understand or judge the developer</p>

<p><strong>If you're a small startup owner, and you have to hire a developer for section you don't know well, what questions would you ask?</strong></p>
","<h2>Technical questions</h2>

<p>(You're not technical, so I'd gather this won't speak much to you, but I'll mention them for reference in the event someone technical ends up googling this.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Have him show a few code samples</strong> to get a feel of how the developer codes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have him solve a trivial problem</strong> such as coding a FizzBuzz, to eliminate chaff immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have him explain how he'd solve a complex problem</strong> such as programming the game of Monopoly, to get a feel of his ability to manipulate abstract concepts and data structures.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Style questions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ask which source control software he works with</strong>. If the answer is ""none"" or has any hint of ""I sometimes use"" in it, you most definitely do NOT want to be working with him -- he will deliver a steaming pile of unmaintainable spaghetti.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask whether he uses tools to check his coding style</strong>. I'm fine with an answer like ""none, but I follow [this or that] standard(s)"" but I do eliminate those who don't seem to be following any. Each language has some standards, and any half decent programmer will have run into them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask how much he uses automated or unit testing</strong>. ""What's unit testing?"" types of answers are a big no no because they're a sign that you're dealing with a beginner. At the other extreme, ""I aim for 100% coverage"" or ""test-driven development"" types of answers are good or bad depending on who you ask. (I tend to view them as a sign that the programmer <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/304910/24932"">wastes a lot of time on things that provide little marginal benefit</a> in comparison with the extra maintenance costs. YMMV.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask what tools he generally uses when he works in a team</strong>: project management, ticketing system, etc. No tools at all means he's coding in his ivory tower and has yet to learn tips, tricks, and best practices at the side of more seasoned peers.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Portfolio questions</h2>

<p>Last but not least, <strong>ask the candidate to describe the past projects he's worked on that he is most proud of</strong>. I do so because the way a developer talks about his portfolio speaks mountains about whether you want to be working with him or not.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some are so oblivious to what they're coding that they'll blabber about how they wrote functions without the slightest clue of what the functions were then being used for. You don't want those.</p></li>
<li><p>Most speak in more or less jargon about this or that cool app or language or what have you that got them really excited. Cool stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>A rare few are able to clearly articulate the benefits they brought to their former clients. These are the developers you most want to be working with, because they'll have your ROI in mind and will seek to offset their costs. (But they're rare, and usually expensive.)</p></li>

"10% share offer that seems ridiculous","902","","<p>One of my friends owns the idea to create a new startup but he does not have the knowledge to do so. </p>

<p>At first when he told me about it he was planning to hire external companies to do the job and the technology - which I imagine it is very expensive- . </p>

<p>Now, as I know how the technology works and I actually know how to develop the idea, I proposed him to partner in the idea.</p>

<p>At first he loved the idea and discussed it with me. As I said , he is not a technical person and he will not take part of the code. If any,he would be giving the ideas.</p>

<p>As I feel that the idea is great, I was thinking about leaving my job and work full time on the idea.My offer was that he would not need to pay me.</p>

<p>Now, what he offered me is a 10% which I feel is not what I deserve.</p>

<p>I understand he will be making the initial investment.But I also believe that doing so does not mean that he needs to own 90% of the company when I'll do all the technical work.</p>

<p>On the one hand , It is a true that he will be doing all the bussines related like meeting with investors and so on- and that my monetary investment would be $0.</p>

<p>On the other hand , I'll risk a lot more time than he would,I'll do all the technical work and I'll leave my current work to be focused. He is planning to stay at his current job</p>

<p>I tried to argue with the fact that at first we can focus on returning his investment, but at the long rung it could not 90-10 as he proposed. He didn't like the idea, and offered me back the 10%.</p>

<p>If I don't agree, he told me he would be getting the job done from external companies.He told me that the price it would cost him is about $20000 which I really don't believe it is true. I think this last behavior is part of his plan to get a bigger share.</p>

<p>Start by reading <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1886/1824"">Joel's Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup</a>. Following it you should be laughing at your ""friend's"" face and telling him:</p>

<p><strong>zero risk + zero investment + zero work = zero shares.</strong></p>

<p>If anything you should be the one offering 1% as a courtesy for the idea. Maybe a few more percent for a few clients, investors, and advice on the side. Unless he quits his full time job and takes the same risks as you do, he basically deserves <strong><em>zero</em></strong>.</p>

"using agile with a startup or small business","900","","<p>At my small business, the developers have been a using scrum-like, agile development strategy. Since most of us in the company are developers, we've started adding general business tasks to the project board in addition to coding tasks.</p>

<p>We'd like to start using a new board just for these business tasks, so we can better include everyone in the company and separate the business tasks from the coding tasks. Some of the scrum roles such as product-owner don't really fit into this model easily though. Are there any scrum adaptations or other agile methodologies that work well for running a startup or small business?</p>
","<p>At my business, we've been using an all-inclusive scrum-styled board, with 5 columns for different ""item states"", but also rows for the different categories of items across our entire business. I want to note, this is <em>in addition to</em> the plethora of software we use for bug tracking, Google Docs (I said it -- used for international communication), and <em>trello</em> which we use for the product development.</p>

<p>Our scrum board is based off of the legendary <em>Silicon Valley (TV Series)</em>, and includes columns labeled ""Ice Box,"" ""Emergency,"" ""In Progress,"" ""Testing,"" and ""Complete."" We use this board for <em>major</em> items of our board, and we consider it an <em>in-office supplement</em> to our other tools, be it marketing lead gens or various business spreads (and obviously the above mentioned software tracking tools). The visual nature of the board is extremely beneficial for staying on task.</p>

<p>Different from some companies, since we're small, we have nametags that we put on items when they're being worked on, so we can see who is tackling what. Once it goes into Complete, we take the nametag off and place it around (that way, one person 'carries' an item into a new category, and may or may not continue working on it in that section).</p>

<p>The biggest thing with scrum to remember is the assigning of <em>epochs and stories.</em> This allows us to categorize and quantify the size and grouping of each item into the scope of our project.</p>

<p>We only have a few developers that are domestic (I switch between project/product manager, full stack developer, etc.), but we hold meetings every morning and basically try to optimize our time by only including those relevant for each category. We really don't spend too much time on this, since so many of us are multi-tasking many areas. </p>

<p>The whole point of scrum is to maintain communication, prevent blocks, and organize the development experience. You can read more about scrum <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)"">here</a>.</p>

<p>To provide a direct answer to your question, if you think you're at the point where your business is large enough to have two direct verticals - (software and business) - particularly, that <em>people on one side don't need to see everything on the other,</em> then by all means split the two boards. The reality is that you can only use so much space for two things before each has grown to a point where you are forced to split them.</p>

<p>I just want to say, we have about a 8-to-1 ratio between our ""software stuff"" (design to dev to admin) and ""business stuff"" (Marketing, Clients, Financials, Investors etc.).</p>

<p>Just remember that scrum is a system made for development. It doesn't necessarily apply so well to business tasks, particularly when working with burn-downs (too many loose estimates and often moving parts, hard to estimate).</p>

<p>There are other tools to use for business tracking, like mentioned <a href=""http://www.dumblittleman.com/2009/02/7-great-ways-to-track-your-progress.html"">on this site</a>. But I would definitely recommend Trello if you're looking at building a fairly simple to-do list, and sharing those lists with other people.</p>

"Is it better for a tech founder to be highly skilled or well rounded?","898","","<p>This question really bugs me, so I have to ask it.</p>

<p>The tech community, especially in the past few years, has become quite worthy of satire. With shows like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)"">Silicon Valley</a>, there has been no shortage of all the hype the tech community brings to the startup community.</p>

<p>Having gone to school for four years, I saw an amazing amount of software being built by people who <em>thought they wanted to do startups.</em> </p>

<p>The reality is, these programmers had very unique traits which I observed:</p>

<h1>Advantages</h1>

<ul>
<li>They are good at making stuff</li>
<li>They can put in a lot of hours</li>
<li>They like their own ideas</li>
</ul>

<h1>Disadvantages</h1>

<ul>
<li>They have little understanding of how real people behave</li>
<li>Their ideas are often very impractical or inapplicable</li>
<li>They have no idea what makes a good user experience</li>
</ul>

<p>What I've drawn from all of this, is that people are wasting so much time writing <em>bad code.</em> I don't mean erroneous, sloppy, or even inefficient code. I mean that people are spending so much time writing code that nobody will ever use - and often these people think that their app is the next Zuckerbergian release.</p>

<p>I just rarely see tech people get anything done that people use, except the one out of a million billion dollar breakthroughs. </p>

<p>Some parallel questions, to reduce on any sort of opinionated response:</p>

<p>Does specialization fall apart in a company when there is a lack of relationship between different business verticals (software, marketing, etc.)? I just don't get why the world is building so many inapplicable (but often highly skilled) programmers who have no idea how to write code that is <em>economical.</em></p>

<p>Clarifications
  - focus on small companies (startups)</p>
","<p>I'd say that it depends on the size of the startup. If the founder is going solo, a certain amount of breadth is essential to get a business going at all. On the other hand, if the company has a handful of people, the roles can be a little more specialized.</p>

<p>One well-known example I can think of is the Steve Jobs/Wozniak combo in the founding of Apple. Wozniak tended more toward the highly-skilled/specialized category, while Jobs had the vision and breadth to turn it into an actual company. I don't think either one on their own could have created the success that they had together.</p>

<p>I think that the problem you're alluding to is caused because it's hard to get both sets of skills together in the early stages of a company. A lot of founders overestimate their own abilities, either on the technical or the business side, and that's where you see companies going off the rails. Either you get the brilliant technical mind that creates some widget that nobody actually has a practical use for, or you get the business side that over-promises and under-delivers.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> See also: the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. People unskilled in an area tend to grossly overestimate their own ability in that area. Furthermore, these people fail to recognize actual skill in other people. In the case of startups, this distorted perception could easily keep founders from seeking the help they need to create a successful business.</p>

"What is hockey stick growth?","890","","<p>Just to be clear, I get that hockey stick growth includes a transition from incremental to exponential growth, but it seems like there's more to it. For example, it appears that in the context of startups that the shift from growth happens based on finding a market, which seems to be of zero use in understanding the concept, since growth of this nature without a ""market"" would not be possible.</p>

<p>In the real world, what is hockey stick growth?</p>
","<p>The usual point people are making when they talk about hockey sticks is that there's a <strong>significant initial loss-making</strong> phase, followed by <strong>rapid growth</strong>, that (very importantly) <strong>continues strongly for an extended period</strong> so that the early loss/investment phase is immaterial in the medium term.</p>

<p>And the usual <em>reason</em> people talk to you about the hockey stick is that <strong>they are burning money, fast</strong> and they want you to believe that's a very smart move.</p>

<p>So of course it can be, but there are at least two other strategies relating expenditure and earnings for a startup.  First comes <strong>bootstrapping</strong>, which typically breaks down into three variants: <strong>slow burn</strong> where the initial cash pile is spent uber-frugally, <strong>pennies from heaven</strong> where the startup stays north of the loss line by bringing in other income (e.g. consulting / the day job), and <strong>strike one, two, three...</strong> where a series of hopeful MVPs is deployed and developed following validation, until there's evidence of traction.</p>

","<p>For a public company to go private some entity has to buy up almost all the stock. The specifications for US companies are on the SEC website <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/gopriv.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>As for the shareholders who have less of the stock, they are basically bought out through a process called a ""reverse stock split"" that essentially consolidates the old shares into less, more valuable new shares. </p>

<p>For example, I own 200 shares of company X and they decide to reverse stock split at a ratio of 100:1. Now I can either choose to take two new shares in exchange for my 200 old ones or I can just sell out to someone else. If I only had 50 shares, the company would likely just pay me cash instead of issuing me new stock. This process consolidates the number of shareholders to a point where the company can 'go private'.</p>

In such cases, there is often <em>no limit</em> to the extent to which those individuals can be held personally responsible for the acts of their businesses: e.g. if their business were to default on a large debt, they could be sued personally for everything that they own (and, ultimately, be declared bankrupt).  The individuals are said to have <strong>unlimited liability</strong>.</p>

<p>Recognising that this risk discourages people from going into business, most jurisdictions have decided also to recognise forms of business in which the individuals' liability is <em>limited</em> in some way: e.g. the liability of the individuals above might be limited only to their business's assets.  The trade-off is that it usually involves increased formalities and obligations.  The individuals are said to have <strong>limited liability</strong>.</p>

<p>The word <strong>company</strong> (like ""companions"") literally refers to people who ""come together"" (or <em>associate</em>) for a common purpose.  Thus any association whose members have limited liability could be described (at very least colloquially) as a <strong>limited liability company</strong>; indeed, this is for what ""LLC"" is an initialism in the USA and Egypt.</p>

<p>In the Philippines, ""LLC"" is an initialism for ""<em>limited liability corporation</em>"".  The word <strong>corporation</strong> (like ""corpse"") literally refers to a ""body"" (or a person) that has been created by law.  Since the law recognises corporations as people, they have many of the same rights and obligations as you and me: e.g. they are litigious; they have capacity to contract; they can own assets/owe liabilities; etc.  Despite the language, it is not the corporation itself whose liability is limited but rather the people who form it.  Thus any person created by law whose members have limited liability could be described as a <strong>limited liability corporation</strong>.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Does it indicate a specific type of company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the three countries mentioned above, ""LLC"" does indeed refer to specific forms of undertaking that are distinct from other possibilities.  However, within each of those countries the exact nature/requirements/obligations/etc differ:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An LLC in the United States is <em>unincorporated</em>: that is, it does not have its own legal personality and therefore all assets and liabilities are technically owned/owed <em>by the members</em> rather than the company in its own right.  In order to benefit from limited liability, the members of such an LLC must be sure to hold the business's assets clearly apart from their own personal assets.</p></li>
<li><p>An LLC in Egypt or the Philippines is <em>incorporated</em> (note that this is so even though, as in the USA, the Egyptian term is an initialism for ""<em>company</em>"" and not ""<em>corporation</em>"").  There are a number of specific differences between the entities in the two countries, but they are somewhat beyond the scope of this answer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In countries where ""LLC"" is not a specifically recognised business vehicle, the term might erroneously be used to refer to types of association that bear some other name yet nevertheless have limited liability.  In particular, it is often used (in lay contexts) to refer to entities that have similar characteristics to a US LLC&mdash;see Wikipedia for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company#International_equivalents"" rel=""nofollow"">international equivalents</a>.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>For which countries the LLC concept is valid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As indicated above, one can either interpret the concept in a general sense (in which case most countries have <em>some</em> form through which people may associate to conduct business with limited liability), or it can be interpreted to mean a specific type of entity bearing that name (in which case it only exists in the relevant jurisdiction: I'm only aware of the three countries mentioned above, but there may well be some others).</p></li>

"How can I stop offering a service?","858","","<p>Basically, how can a business stop offering a service?</p>

<p>Additionally, should you give current customers a certain amount of notice? Are there any legal or ethical aspects that should be considered?</p>

<p>Are there any differences for this between free and paid services?</p>
","<ol>
<li><h3>Did you agree to continue providing the service for a certain period of time, or to give a certain amount of notice before withdrawing it?</h3>

<p>You haven't stated your jurisdiction, but in many places any such agreement might carry the force of law&mdash;and therefore a breach by you could give rise to claims against you. In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law"">common law</a> jurisdictions (predominantly those with British heritage), such claims would only exist in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"">contract</a> if and only if the user had given some valuable <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"">consideration</a> in return for the agreement.</p></li>
<li><h3>Even if you did not agree to any such thing, might the service users have a reasonable expectation that they would receive a certain amount of notice?</h3>

<p>It's less likely that a mere <em>expectation</em> such as this could give rise to any enforceable rights, but again it is dependent on the legal jurisdiction.  For example, if the user acted to their detriment in reliance upon their expectation, it might be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(legal_concept)"">inequitable</a> for you to act contrary to it.</p></li>
<li><h3>Even if users do not have any grounds for bringing a claim against you, you might nevertheless damage your reputation/goodwill.</h3>

<p>It's almost impossible to say how much damage might be inflicted (or how it could be limited) in the general case, as the particular facts of your case would be extremely relevant.  I can think of situations where companies have given  over 12 months' notice before terminating free services for which they probably had no obligation to provide&mdash;and yet they still suffered some damage to their reputation as a result.</p>

<p>Nevertheless some thoughts from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the service only has a few users, you could consult with them to decide how it might best be terminated without harming their needs.  This might, for example, involve keeping the service active (perhaps at their expense) until they have been able to migrate fully to an alternative&mdash;and might include you providing assistance with that migration.  If the service has many users, you could form a panel to represent their needs and conduct the consultation through that panel.</p></li>
<li><p>If a full consultation is impractical, you could consider a number of alternatives and ask your users to vote on their preference.  At least that way, they would still feel as though they had some control over the outcome and it wasn't just thrust upon them as a <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fait_accompli""><em>fait accompli</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I would continue for some time after termination to provide users with an opportunity to obtain copies of any data (in a standard format, such as CSV) that they have provided to your system.</p></li>

"How To Be Young and Taken Seriously","850","","<p>This is a hypothetical question, as I've so far been fortunate enough not to encounter a situation wherein it's been a problem, but how can a young person (I'm nineteen, so not <em>super</em> young but still fairly) be taken seriously in entrepreneurship, particularly in management?</p>

<p>I'm a developer, and I have been for quite some time. Longer than many adults I've met, in fact. I've worked with several clients who've actually appreciated my age, but I often worry about what it will be like when I'm ready to expand my business, a time that's rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>I'm confident in my technical prowess, and I'm certainly comfortable writing some pretty--if I do say so myself--cool code. But there just aren't many developers out there who are as young as I am and ready to get going (that is, who aren't currently attending university). That's less and less true every year as I get older, of course, but as my business grows and I start thinking about hiring on some extra hands, I wonder what the result might look like if I hire someone who is umpteen years my senior. I'd rather not wait a number of years if I could double my income <em>now.</em></p>

<p>So are there any good tips on how to be taken seriously as a boss who's significantly younger than your employees? Or is this just a nonissue and most people are alright with it? Obviously I recognize that the hiring process would weed out some less enthusiastic potential hires.</p>

<p>I do actually have a team now in India, but I'm pretty sure they don't know my age. I also didn't hire them on, they've been assigned to me through a client. So I have management experience, more or less. This isn't a question of skill or ability (<a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/64/can-young-people-start-up"">Can young people start-up?</a>), but more just logistics.</p>

<p>I'm also focusing this question particularly on my age. The gap between a 19 year old and a 24 year old, as I'm sure we all know, is much wider than that between a person who's 40 and one who's 45. I suspect the latter would be a bit easier an age difference to live with.</p>
","<p>I'm not sure whether you're asking:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>How can a person (who, like yourself, is young but experienced) avoid suffering prejudice due to their youth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In theory, this <em>should</em> be relatively easy to overcome.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have been fortunate to only work with very meritocratic people, but my experience (from working in businesses both large and small) is that physical attributes (sex, race, religion, disability, age, etc) only become an issue for others in the workplace when the individual concerned starts to draw attention to them, perhaps because they feel slightly insecure about that feature and their lack of confidence starts to show through things that they say or do.</p>

<p>For example: if 24-year-old Alice finds herself working for 19-year-old Bob and Bob draws attention to the fact that he's 5 years younger than her, she might well feel upset.  If instead Bob focuses on his work and how they can both contribute to their common goals, it's unlikely ever to cross her mind.  After all, the roles of manager and managee are very different and may not suit everyone: plenty of people who are lower down an office hierarchy are more important (to the business) and better-remunerated than their senior managerial colleagues.</p>

<p>However, things don't always work like that: some people may have a proverbial ""chip on their shoulder"" and feel that their careers ought by now to have progressed further than they have.  They might well feel aggrieved irrespective of Bob's attitude&mdash;in which case Bob could try involving them in a more collaborative team-based decision-making process, giving everyone an opportunity to relate the present challenges to their past experiences.  He would thereby be able to draw subtle attention to the fact that he has actually solved similar problems in the past and so build some trust and respect for his competence and abilities.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to gain the confidence of one's colleagues is by actually <em>proving</em> one's own value through the work that one delivers.  It may not be immediate, but people do 
learn to trust reliable colleagues remarkably quickly.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>How can a person (who is inexperienced, regardless of their age) demonstrate that they have the competence and ability to handle challenges that they have not before encountered?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is always a tough nut to crack.  I'm sure we've all been guilty at some point of judging people not by what they might be able to accomplish but rather by what they have done in the past.</p>

<p>Whilst one might not have any direct experience of having solved an identical challenge, it's usually possible to identify elements of the current problem that are similar to other experiences in one's past.  Simply being able to articulate that analysis will inspire a degree of confidence in one's general problem-solving abilities combined with the fact that one has thought the problem through.</p>

<p>Having a plan is absolutely essential: that is, a clear idea of what the objectives are and precisely how one intends to accomplish them; it should also anticipate potential problems and have a strategy for tackling them when they arise.  Being able to communicate such a plan articulately will begin the process of overcoming concerns over inexperience.</p>

<p>Faced with someone in that position (inexperienced but with a plan), my next concern might be that they are over-confident.  Are they prepared to listen to constructive criticism and adapt their plan accordingly?  Will they be too proud to make changes if their plan isn't working?  If they show a collaborative decision-making streak and a readiness to seek out advice from those with more experience, those fears would be considerably reduced.</p></li>

"Best way to ask existing investors for more money","836","","<p>I have a group of angel investors and friends &amp; family who have put in various amounts over the past 18 months.  The amounts range from $15k - $150k.  I send semi-monthly updates to the group with various milestones or challenges of the business.  ""Raising more money"" has been a recurring theme and challenge but none of the investors have offered to write an additional check but I feel it is time to ask them directly.</p>

<p>The business is growing, albeit slowly.  It is not a runaway success yet, but everything is moving to the right and up.</p>

<p>What is the best approach/ language to go about asking the current investors for more money?</p>

<p>(Note, these are not institutional investors.)</p>
","<p>With any investor, it is good practice to keep them informed and let them know how hard their money is working for you, which it seems you are already doing.</p>

<p>However since this also includes family &amp; friends, it's doubly important you take the time to let them know that they are important, their money is important (to you, you're not just going to throw it away), and what you're doing with it is important, since they are investing in <em>you</em> just as much as they are in your company. Even an investor who is a stranger is investing in <em>you</em> first (and your team), as he expects you to be the one with the capability and the know-how to pull it off.</p>

<p>Since you've already received some checks, it would be ideal to create some stat sheets showing them what you've done with the money so far. How many user/customers do you have now, from when you started? What is your growth rate? Have you turned a profit yet?</p>

<p>If you're going for the <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html"">Amazon growth model vs. Ben &amp; Jerry's</a>, you may still have significant figures to show them: were you mentioned in any news articles? High-ranking blogs? Were you mentioned on twitter, fb, linkedin by anybody besides yourself? If popularity is what you need to grow, are you becoming more popular and more talked-about, and have stats to show?</p>

<p>That shows them you've taken every dollar they've given you and put it to work. You're making something significant out of their money. It was a good investment for them. Next they will want to know: ""Why? Why do you need more money? For what?""</p>

<p>So, what does <em>Phase Two</em> for your business entail? Are you planning on adding some significant new features, requiring you to hire on a high-dollar programmer or engineer? If so, what are the details of these new features, and how will they win you more customers/users/paid gigs? This part you will want to <em>sell</em> like you're selling to new customers who might buy into your product because of these features. Make your investors feel the thrill and excitement of a first-time customer to your business, so they can aptly imagine how you will sell it to others.</p>

<p>If you're not yet turning a profit, then money is time. It's time your business gets to stay alive to figure itself out enough to turn a profit. Now, if your main reason for needing more money is, ""we need more time,"" then that's a tough sell.</p>

<p>One way to do this is with projected figures. Hopefully you have some numbers from <em>Phase I</em>, where you told all your existing investors what a great job their money did for you already. Now take all those hard numbers and project them into the future! ""Here's all the great stats we will have if we keep going!"" Again, this part is a <em>really</em> tough sell, so try to sprinkle and emphasize what you will be doing differently and improving upon. (What is <em>new?</em>) ""<del>Our inventory is a mess, so</del> We added a new inventory system that tracks our orders so we can get product out the door faster (to keep up with all our orders!)."" ""We hired a new sales rep [overseas] since we noticed a lot of orders coming from that area!"" etc.</p>

<p>Finally, I don't know if this was done the first time around but I would say it makes you look more professional if you already have a figure in mind for how much you need. Yes, coming up with a figure of how much to ask for is <strong><em>HARD</em></strong> and you may be inclined to ask for ""all you can get"", but it makes you look more professional and like you took the time run the numbers and think this through if you do (because, incidentally, that's what it requires). ""Here's what we did with all the money you gave us initially (ty!), now here's our plans for <em>Phase II</em>, and here's how much funding we'll need to execute Phase II. Oh, and here's what will happen <del>if</del> when Phase II goes off as planned!"" </p>

<p>As with any investors, make it appear as if you've thought this thing through from top to bottom (as if you already had the money) and the only thing holding you back is them giving you the cash to do it.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful! Good luck, and I hope in your future it comes down like rain!</p>

"iOS vs Android first: What makes iOS first a valid strategy for mobile app companies?","790","","<p>The pattern for most mobile app startups appears to be to release an app on iOS first then release an Android version. Later, they may release on other platforms like windows and blackberry. Some examples I can think of right now are Simple, Mailbox and Robinhood. </p>

<p>Since Android has a much larger market share than iOS, it seems like it would make more sense to launch there first. <a href=""http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp"">(84.7% vs 11.7%)</a> What then is the technical or business reason for companies to use this iOS first strategy?</p>
","<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Answer is there is no clear answer. In my opinion, the best solution would be to pick a platform that enables deploying to both unless you've got to write platform dependent code, run-time issues based on your specs result in failures in converting and retaining users, etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>As you point out, <a href=""http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Android continues to dominate the global smartphone market</a>, with over 255 million units shipped and nearly 85% of the market share in the second quarter of 2014. Given Apple introduced two new iPhone 6 models this month, it's possible that Apple will gain more market share, though that's yet to be seen.  Market share in this case refers to installs, and the issue is that the count of devices running a given system turns out to be a bit deceptive in the context of selecting a platform to build apps for. </p>

<p>Main issue is that Apple's devices on average have better hardware, and as a result, have a larger market share when it comes to devices that are able to run higher end apps. It turns out that two thirds of the devices that make up Android’s 81 percent market share are cheap “<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2013/11/15/android-dominates-market-share-but-apple-makes-all-the-money/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">junk phones</a>”.</p>

<p>The next issue is that install counts do not take into account the fragmentation that Google has allowed with the Android platform; Apple’s primary rival is really Samsung, not Google. Depending on the requirements for the app, this might not be an issue.</p>

<p>While there are other factors to account for, many which are driven by context, the OS's usage and engagement online is a huge factor:</p>

<p><strong>Percentage of Web Traffic Worldwide</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvSVp.jpg"" alt=""OS&#39;s usage and engagement ""></p>

<p>The chart above shows the percentage of total web traffic worldwide, across all platforms, that is taken up by Android, iOS, and Linux; source: <a href=""http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=9&amp;qpcustom=iOS,Android,Linux&amp;sample=29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">netmarketshare</a>. Clearly, Android is making grounds with online usage, though it's important to recall that online use does not equal high-end hardware. In fact, when it comes to web-traffic, apps really are not the best solution in most cases, mobile websites are.</p>

<p><strong>App Stores for iOS vs. Android</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/psHLP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>According to Piper Jaffray, the source of the graph above, they claim apps are no longer a ""point of differentiation,"" having become an expected feature for modern smartphones. Chart reflects top 200 apps for both stores as January 2014, 38 paid and 74 free titles were found on both platforms. That said, if you're a top 200 app on one platform, likelihood that you'd do both platforms to leverage your brand's value is pretty high; meaning these stats and the resulting <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/06/apps-no-longer-differentiator-in-ios-vs-android-war-services-next-battleground"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">analysis that apps are not a platform selection for consumers</a> is likely flawed.</p>

Don’t worry that it will make your idea seem “derivative.” Some of the best ideas in history began by sticking together two existing ideas no one realized could be combined."" (YCombinator website).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think?</p>
","<p>For what it's worth, a business is usually best described by a benefit it provides to who, which is to say by a unique selling proposition.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""I'm an attorney"" doesn't sound nearly as interesting as ""I bust traffic tickets."" The day you actually get a ticket, you sure as hell will remember the latter but probably not the former.</p></li>
<li><p>""I'm an architect"" likewise sounds boring, whereas ""I help constructors get paid faster, by stepping them through the red tape at the city hall"" might sound very exciting to a construction company.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of ""I'm a marketing copywriter,"" try ""I help companies transform their words into wealth.""</p></li>
<li><p>In my own case, ""I help startups refine their marketing to attract more customers and grow faster"" is better than ""I'm a marketing consultant.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to have a line that an average 12-year old can make sense of and generate a ""Tell me more?"" type of response. The ""We help [target] [action verb] [benefit]"" format is a good one, but not the only one.</p>

<p>The pitfalls to avoid are labels (""I'm a software developer""), features (""I've 10 years of experience doing software development""), and processes (""I do Agile-driven software development""). These things are of zero interest whatsoever to leads and prospects who have a problem to solve and are shopping around for an answer or a solution to that problem. Put the focus on what your client will get, not on you.</p>

<p>But that's admittedly in the context of interacting with leads and prospects. When talking to an investor, I'd gather that much of the same applies with a few twists, though.</p>

<p>Firstly, note that the prospect in a VC pitch actually is the investor. As such, the core of your lengthy presentation must get the benefit to them across, aka you're here to make them money. In this respect, your startup is a mere process and bundled with features. And that's indeed what they'll be focused on. But don't forget to discreetly deliver the actual message (""We're going to make you money"") in a way or another over the course of your pitch. Because like any prospect, they're shopping around for solutions to problems that they need to solve.</p>

<p>Secondly, and more saliently, your elevator pitch should make it clear what you're about, which is to say <strong><em>what problem you solve for who</em></strong> (and ideally how). Doing so conveys how you intend to make money, and bring the listener's attention to why you have a chance to succeeding. And in this sense I'd side with Alex Iskold.</p>

<p>Take all of this with a grain of salt though, as I've never pitched an investor myself. (The closest I ever got to VCs was delivering turn-key software that helps VCs do their accounting and expedite their reporting to investors. &lt;-- That's a pretty good elevator pitch, btw.)</p>

"Is it feasible to launch an app working alone?","781","","<p>I'm a developer and I work alone. I've been studying about cloud applications for some time now and have interest in developing one such app with both web and mobile clients. Although from the programming standpoint I know I can do it (the only thing is that working alone will take a little more time to finish it), I don't know if it is feasible to launch such an app alone.</p>

<p>I know there are lots of concerns like: marketing to sell the product, the bureaucracy involved, there should also be tutorials for people to learn to use the app, and also it's necessary to manage the finances. This is just a short list that I could think right now about it. Looking at this from the standpoint of a developer is a little daunting.</p>

<p>So my question is: is it feasible to launch one app alone? If it is, how can it be done? I mean, which guidelines I could follow so that I simplify those things until the app grows enough so that more people can be hired?</p>
","<p>It's feasible, but I'd personally advise not to.</p>

<p>This advice is based on experiencing it first-hand. I launched a software business alone a few years back. I did the programming, the marketing and sales, managed the affiliates, handled customer support, and basically everything else. And I learned this lesson the hard way: you can only stretch yourself so much.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, your work output is limited by your ability to get the job of two or three people done in a timely manner: where with a cofounder you'd be worrying about releasing a new version, when you're alone you also need to worry about supporting users and affiliates and what have you all while developing, as well as worry about the documentation if applicable, pinging your affiliates, and so forth before releasing, and don't get me started on the administrative BS or how time consuming trying to close investors can be.</p>

<p>Even if you hire VAs or staff to assist you in these tasks, you still need to manage them at the end of the day because you're alone, and that takes mental bandwidth too.</p>

<p>My takeaway was this: be in charge of outputting the product, and have a cofounder be in charge of just about everything else. Or vice versa. This setup frees the lead developer's mind, and allows to get things done a heck of a lot faster. Plus, it's useful to have someone to bounce ideas off when needed.</p>

"How does one deal with being shouldered out of a startup at stage of inception?","780","","<p>To put things into perspective - I had recently participated in a Start Up Weekend program. </p>

<p>My project pitch was not selected (although I did receive positive feedback) and so I joined another pitcher's team.</p>

<p>I worked hard and provided a good amount of useful input throughout the weekend (even provided the foundation for a rethink of their project when we hit the wall following their idea). </p>

<p>Overall the project was positively evaluated and the weekend ended - except that I am getting the feeling that my team mates are of the mind to cut me out at this stage.</p>

<p>Yes - feeling. I could be very wrong and it could be that these team mates are just 'resting' but communication has dwindled. It also doesn't help that of this team I was the only outsider - they otherwise all had strong working relationships - and my skill set is completely different to theirs.</p>

<p>As such - I guess I have two related questions here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How does one be certain that one is being shouldered out? and</p></li>
<li><p>What does one do to prevent (or at least deal with) being treated unfairly in such a circumstance (no contracts were signed)?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>A startup weekend does not a business make.  It is a great running start, but the company still has over 90% of the work left to have a complete product.</p>

<p>You ran with them for the first sprint.  You helped them refine <em>their</em> idea and bring it to a better, more viable state.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does one be certain that one is being shouldered out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no easy way to check.  Eventually they will formalize their relationships with each other and you will be included or not.  </p>

<p>There are some tell-tale signs that might help you measure this, though.  How much access do you have to the project work?  Is there a repository you do or do not have access to of documentation, code, designs, strategy?  Are people asking you questions or keeping you in the loop?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does one do to prevent (or at least deal with) being treated unfairly in such a circumstance (no contracts were signed)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be consistently valuable.  Prove to them that you are excited about the project, that you have a lot of value to it, and that you are willing to go the distance.  Show them this through your work efforts.</p>

<p>Keep yourself in the loop.  Keep track of the project status, anticipate the next work product needed, and work on it, asking for feedback and status from others on other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>If they are actively working to shut you out it will be pretty obvious if you integrate yourself into their team.  If they aren't actively working to shut you out, then you will be able to force yourself in.</p>

<p>Keep track of all correspondence and work you produce for the project.  If they accept your work and continue working with you, then suddenly leave you in the cold once a contract is written, you can use this as evidence that you have some rights to the company (though, honestly, it's all bitterness and unhappiness from here, but that's your choice).</p>

<p>If you want to force their hand, pursue legal agreements early on in the relationship.  Help them understand that entering a legal contract relationship will only help them in the future, now that the idea has legs.  If nothing comes of it, no problem, but if something does come of it no one will be blind to the part they play and the ownership they have, if any, in the project.</p>

  Dropbox, Airbnb, it applies to every successful founder. They were
  rifle focused about the product to the point where they were being
  rude and a lot of them get accused of being arrogant because they are
  so focused on the product. Because other people, we say hey will you

  make my product better, because guess what, I went from 10,000 users

<ul>
<li>ENTP - Steve</li>
<li>ENTJ - Bill</li>
<li>INTP - Larry &amp; Sergey</li>
<li>INTJ - Elon</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paul Graham: So Ron is famous for investing in founders and so I
  wanted to ask you, when you say you invest in founders, what that
  means is you invest in people with certain traits. Can those traits be
  acquired or is it the case that some people have it and some people
  don’t? Because these people are all interested in starting startups
  right. So I’m going to try and get this stuff out of your brain and
  blow it out on to the audience. That will be helpful to them.</p>
  
  <p>Ron Conway: Without being sloppy. Umm well I have said before,
  entrepreneurs are born to be entrepreneurs. And once you are an
  entrepreneur you’re a serial entrepreneur and you're probably going to
  start companies for the rest of your life or if you're like Zuck or
  Larry Page it might be the only company you start. But you are an
  entrepreneur for life. And I think most entrepreneurs do correctly
  self-select. And I think that entrepreneurs are born, have to be born
  with some of the basics.</p>
  
  <p>Paul Graham: So which traits have to be inborn and which can be
  learned?</p>
  
  <p>Ron Conway: So the basics I think would be you have to have a hell of
  a work ethic. You talked about it at your Stanford class. You have to
  be ambitious, you have to be aggressive, and you have to be tough.
  Because starting a company is the hardest thing on earth to do. I
  don’t think people realize that until they do it. Since I’ve watched
  thousands of entrepreneurs do it, I know how hard it is. Plus I
  started my own company, Altos computer in the 70's, so I know from
  personal knowledge how hard it is and I started another couple of
  companies as well.</p>
  
  <p>Paul Graham: And so you think the driven part has to be inborn?</p>
  
  <p>Ron Conway: For sure. You can't learn to be ambitious and be driven.
  Obviously you have to be curious, you have to be intelligent. I think
  being a founder is like a vocation. But if you have those basic skills
  where you're determined, you're tough, you have a huge work ethic,
  you're completely rifle focused, then there’s other things you have to
  learn. You have to learn to hire a management team. You have to learn
  how to manage. These things you're not born with. These things, you
  have to want success so badly that you learn how to manage. You learn
  how to find a management team. You learn how to recruit people and
  then spread your vision and motivate them to be just like you and be
  fanatical about your business.</p>
  
  <p>Paul Graham: So how can they tell? How can these people, you know it
  would save them a lot of trouble if you tell could tell them now
  whether they are going to succeed in starting a startup. How can they
  tell if they are driven enough?</p>
  
  <p>Ron Conway: Well I mean are you willing to work 24/7. The really great
  entrepreneurs are 24/7. The word moonlighting is not even in their
  vocabulary. I mean if they are dating somebody or they are married,
  they warn their spouse that they are not first in line. That this
  company dream is first in line and that you have this vocation. It's
  like being a priest or a nun that your duty is to your company. No, it
  has to be that fanatical and if you look at all the successful
  entrepreneurs they are that committed about it. That is a hard
  commitment, but once you are willing to make that commitment then it
  solves the work ethic check off. If you have that commitment then your
  passion is probably infectious. It probably means you can in fact find
  other people and make them as excited about your idea as you are.</p>
  
  <p>Paul Graham: So you can use it.</p>
  
  <p>Ron Conway: So you have to be a good communicator. You've got to be
  able to excite other people.</p>

"Best way of dividing equity among founders","772","","<p>What is the best way of equity division when founding a startup?</p>

<p>What did you take into consideration when dividing equity among members when you were founding your own startup?</p>
","<p>Very interesting question. Of course, there's no really great way to answer this generally, since every startup is different. But here are my thoughts on what factors might be at play in the general sense. Most of this is applicable amongst employees pre-equity-division in general, more than just the founder(s).</p>

<p><strong>How do we define ""founder?""</strong></p>

<p>This might seem like a silly point, but it's important. In the fast-paced world of modern startups, it's hard to really define boundaries. Who is a founder in the conventional sense, and who just came along for the ride soon after it started? Let's say your idea is for a mobile app, but you have no development experience. You hire a developer that significantly helps guide you through the process. You couldn't do it with him, and he's had a huge impact on the direction your app has gone that will probably make you a whole lot more money in the long-run, but at the same time, it wasn't all his idea in the first place. You might plan to keep him on indefinitely as the head of development, even as you hire more developers, but he isn't a founder. So how much do you give him? The same story could easily be applied to many other positions. Do we give equity just for being around for a while? Does implementation deserve as much credit as innovation? Probably not, at least in most people's eyes, but you'll have to think about where that balance strikes for you. I bet in most successful startups, there are at least a couple people who came on relatively late in the game but still brought invaluable assets that helped make the dream a reality. How much are people like that worth, equity-wise?</p>

<p><strong>Irreplaceability</strong></p>

<p>I've long-held that equity should be indicative fundamentally to a person's individual and personal worth to the company. Sounds obvious, right? Well, it's easier said than done. It's really up to a case-by-case decision of how important someone really is to a company, but I think a good starting point when making that decision is how replaceable they are. If the person dropped out now, would the company survive?</p>

<p><strong>Market worth</strong></p>

<p>That brings me nicely to market worth. Part of the job of a pay at any stage in a company's development is to keep employees from going to work elsewhere. If you have a founder who's receiving phone calls frequently from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other companies looking to recruit them, that should tell you two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>This person might be difficult to keep around if we don't give them enough</li>
<li>This person is <em>probably worth keeping around</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So assess the likelihood of your employee or cofounder finding a better job somewhere else, assess how detrimental that would be to your business, and set equity accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Risk assumption</strong></p>

<p>This one is more based on founders specifically, although it can still be widely applied. It comes in part from another great question about equity: <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/184/is-employee-value-derived-from-their-equity"">Is employee value derived from their equity?</a>. As you'll see if you read that question, this person scraped by the senior year of college, and had a cofounder drop out completely. As I agreed in my answer to that question, I think that deserves a lot from equity. So think about that, too: what risks have people put in? Where would people be if your company fell apart? This also has a couple of benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>People who have taken risks, well, subjectively, deserve to be rewarded when it all works out.</li>
<li>People who have taken risks will feel, more than anyone, an overwhelming and relentless drive to see your company succeed. Make sure those people are the ones making decisions in your company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the main points I can think of at the moment. I might well come back and edit this tomorrow, as it is starting to get a little late for me to be thinking about all this stuff now, but to reiterate: when evaluating an employee's potential equity amount, think about their necessity at your company and whether it could be where it is without them, think about what competition you may or may not have to keep them in your business, and think about what risks they have personally taken on to see you succeed.</p>

<p>Yet again, I'm sorry I can't <em>really</em> be more specific than that. I can't really give a good answer that says ""just split it all up equally,"" but I hope these ideas can help spark a productive meeting to decide on the right division.</p>

"How to identify a problem that can be solved with software?","769","","<p>This question might seem a little silly, but it is something I wonder if there are techniques to be done. I'm a physicist and a programmer and for some time now I've been looking forward to create some app which might be useful for people and generate a nice revenue so that I can really make this my work.</p>

<p>Now, although I have the programming knowledge to build the app, my main doubt has been on how to choose which app to build.</p>

<p>In other words, we write software to solve problems, so the point here is that if I want to build and start selling a software I need a problem to be solved. And this problem must be something which people are interested in.</p>

<p>The point is that I have not been able to see a problem that needs solving that hasn't been addressed before. For some time I believe this was just a question of creativity: if I don't have it, I don't have it and there's nothing that can be done. However, lately I've seem many new startups every month and so I wonder if there is some kind of research, some kind of line of thought that might lead to some problem that needs solving through software.</p>

<p>In that case, how to identify a problem that can be solved through the creation of some app? Is there some kind of research, line of thought or anything else that might lead us to find some problems that we can approach, so that we can select one to build an app?</p>
","<p><strong>Understanding of specific industry</strong></p>

<p>To solve a problem, you must first find one. To find a problem in certain industry, you need to understand it very well or otherwise you have just assumptions of what problems there might be. </p>

<p>If you're more of a developer kind, partnering up with somebody who's area of expertise your going for can help a lot in idea validation phase. </p>

<p><strong>Find pain points</strong></p>

<p>As you get familiar with industry of your choice, you can see behaviour patterns in it. Mailman wakes up early, gets the papers, drivers around your neighbourhoods. These are usually things which are 'always done like this'. Finding most time consuming or complex steps in these patterns can be possible pain points, that in your case technology could fix.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding of behaviour</strong></p>

<p>When you have your industry figured out and have found possible 'painpoints', you have to understand WHY people behave in a way they currently do. In many cases, possible solution you could offer is something nobody feels comfortable doing, as they don't necessarily see the problem. Also, solving redudant problem isn't attractive. Selling shoelaces that tie them up automatically is a novelty product, its not really that big of a deal to do it yourself. </p>

<p><strong>Talking to people</strong></p>

<p>The most important step, before writing a single line of code: Talk with people who could be your potential customers. Tell them how you see their work and what you could do to make it easier. Listen every word they say, and ask more detailed questions. Digging deeper and deeper will eventually make them say <code>hell, if you could make an app like that, I would buy it right away!</code> Repeat as many times as you can and you'll have strong knowledge base of A. the real problem and B. customers who already love you.</p>

<p><strong>Deliver</strong></p>

<p>After you've found right market, pain points you can fix, customers loving your product, its time to deliver. Build only necessary features first, and iterate with early adopters. Test what works and what doesn't, learn more along the road. Even the best ideas with bad execution and user experience end up in trash.</p>

"Can I use logo and domain name of a company that no longer exists?","766","","<p>Is it possible to use the logo and domain name of an old company that went out of business? Specifically, would that be legal?</p>

<p>I already own the domain name that the previous company dropped.</p>

<p>The previous business was registered in France and I'm going to register new business in Canada, and the type of business will be different.</p>
","<p>The answer is <em>probably</em> yes. It depends a bit on how long it's been since the first company went under, but you should be fine anyway since you're in different places geographically (unless they did business in Canada, maybe). The fact that the business type is different helps, too.</p>

<p>I'm not too familiar with Canadian trademark law, admittedly, but essentially the general goal is to protect consumers from confusion. The fact that your business is in a different region and specialty will help with that. If you grabbed up the name of the previous business within days of it going under, that might be confusing, but it sounds like that isn't the case here.</p>

<p>So from a legality standpoint, it sounds fine.</p>

<p>That said, I'd watch out for two little things. I'm sure you've thought of these, but I figure they're worth mentioning.</p>

<ul>
<li>Careful that the previous business doesn't have too much of a reputation (good or bad) that you'll be competing against. If people hear your name and know of the previous one, you don't want them expecting something that isn't you.</li>
<li>Note that the previous business may have blogs or websites pointing at its website. So by taking their domain name, there's a good chance that you'll get a lot of hits to your site from people looking for the other business. Since it sounds like you do different things, that could be frustrating for anyone looking for the other business. On the other hand, it's awkward and not ideal for you to mention ""hey, this isn't <em>[other company]</em> on your 404 page.""</li>

"Business plan to grow up startup job website","753","","<p>I've an idea about a job website which has some unique feature which would benefit both employers and employment seekers. Things are well setup and I am almost done with the development of website. 
Now, I am really confused about how can I start growing my community as sites like job search is dependent upon two factors which are directly proportional to each other, i.e.</p>

<ol>
<li>Employers will not join my website until they see that I've got a good user community (# of registered users)</li>
<li>Users will not join the website until they see that companies are related to my website. (usually, websites shows the logo of companies which are posting jobs)</li>
</ol>

<p>I admit, that I've missed a real thing here which is marketing &amp; I am not sure how can I grow both my user base &amp; company registration. I am iota when comes to plan business so I thought to give ""3 months free job posting for companies"" as my marketing strategy. Now, I've few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How should I approach companies (giants like Microsoft, Deloitte, AT&amp;T etc.) to post job on my portal? Do I have to manually go to their offices and show power point slides or is there any easy way to convince them to join me?</p></li>
<li><p>I've almost zero money to do advertisement on medias like newspaper or TV which I believe attract users at the most. How can I possibly grow my user strength without that? I understand that social media marketing is easy but I've a risk that the time it will take to reach to the ""real users"" will give an opportunity to competitors to replicate my concept. </p></li>
<li><p>I came to know that few website (startups) forcefully ask user to join their site (ex.: via E-mail, SMS) by getting their information from other job website portals.  Ex.: A person can create an recruiter account on monster/indeed and then download all job seekers profile details and then contact them via mail, SMS or calling them. Does that works as it doesn't sound good in terms of ""genuine business strategy""? </p></li>
</ol>
","<p>The problem you're facing is called the chicken and egg problem. In your case I see two solutions two this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Post jobs from company websites that redirect to their career page. This way you give reasons for users to sign up.</p></li>
<li><p>Make your site to be a resume builder. If the quality is good you'll have users signing up solely for the value of having a good resume made.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases when you accumulate a critical amount of users you can start bringing companies into the fold. If you focus on a niche, i.e. the IT sector, you can make a strong case with 1000 or so good resumes.</p>

<p>When you're ready to contact the ""big companies"" keep in mind that you only need to talk to the human resources department. Also keep in mind they have a hiring budget which they need to spend and they have a hiring target, i.e. ""hire 200 people this quarter"" so many of them will be happy to try out your product if it brings them closer to their target.</p>

<p>You can post your website on sites like ProductHunt, Reddit, etc. to gain some early users, which wont require you to spend any amount of money. You can also contact smaller news sites that are in the job sector, they will be happy to write about you if you give them enough material.</p>

<p>You could also start locally, get some exposure on the local media channels and bring on companies from your city. This way there is a match with the company's headquarters and where the users live and you can generate interviews a lot easier this way.</p>

<p>Lastly, allowing recruiters download all your database is a good business strategy since you can charge per data. Big companies want to have access to all the data since they can run it through their own algorithms, or query it as they like and find the best possible candidate.</p>

<p>In particular, I know <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1885/how-much-equity-should-a-partner-with-a-short-term-commitment-be-entitled-to/1886#1886"" title=""Joel&#39;s guide on equity split"">Joel's guide on equity split</a> and <a href=""https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-open-equity-formula/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Buffer's equity formula</a></p>

<p>My question is the following :</p>

<p>We're a team of 3 people, working fulltime for 6 months (the founders)
We have a product, a patent and some customers kicking in.</p>

<p>We want to add more members but can only afford to pay minimum wage (very little outside investment so far)</p>

<p>Will this first employee count as an employee ? so 0.5%-2% equity ?</p>

<p>Or as a co-founder ? so 10%-25% equity ?</p>

<p>Or as a co-ployee ? 2%-5% ?</p>
","<p>The trouble is the lack of salary.</p>

<p>An employee will (or at least should) view stock options as a bonus. If the best you can do is offer a minimum wage, you're technically looking for an extra cofounder.</p>

<p>If you've a patent to protect your IP and some traction, perhaps look for an investor to pour money into the company?</p>

"How does one decide between founders who becomes the President/CEO?","723","","<p>If two founders start a company together and hire some early employees, there is a general sentiment of equality between the founders and the employees.</p>

<p>The employees understand the divide between themselves and the founders, but it becomes difficult to establish a hierarchy between the founders.</p>

<p>Both founders understand that, at some point, one will have to take the lead though, of course, joint leadership is possible (depending on how the company scales).</p>

<p>When that time comes for the founders and the early employees to decide on who takes the lead of President/CEO (if hiring one externally is out of the question), how should they decide?</p>

<p>One founder has many more responsibilities than the other and has done much less in terms of building the company, but was a driving force in the idea and initial founding stage.</p>

<p>Should the founders continue with joint leadership or should the more active founder take the reins (assuming that no hostilities are created by either one taking leadership over the other)?</p>
","<p>It is good to realize that every role has specific responsibilities and tasks, and thus specific personalities and professional experience that fit those roles. When it comes to hierarchy, the executive management works for the shareholders. Yes, a CEO might appear to have the most influential role, but in the end it's the shareholders that decide who the best CEO is. And they can fire her if that is no longer the case.</p>

<p>The role of a CEO is that of a strategic decision-maker. Long-term thinking, and representing the companies interests both inside the company and to the outside world. A CEO is the person who facilitates others to make the vision of the company a reality. You should pick the person who fits that role best, not the one who is most active or had the original idea.</p>

<p>All members of the executive board or management team are required to make the company a success. If you are a technical startup, the CTO role can be more desirable than the CEO role. You can shape the product, services and engineering culture while leaving the politics to the CEO.</p>

<p>I have started a number of companies, but in only one was I the CEO. I enjoyed that position the least, while in the other roles and positions I had a much greater influence on realizing my vision, while making sure that the best visible representative for that vision had the CEO role.</p>

"How do I self promote effectively without being obnoxious?","712","","<p>Everyone always says that you should look to friends and family for your first customers, and that you can spread your company message via word of mouth, but it feels to me like I would end up alienating a lot of friends and family members if I'm constantly plugging my business trying to get people to help me with it.</p>

<p>I've been trying to think up ways I can get people I know to be excited about what I am doing, and so I thought about giving out the product for free...</p>

<p>well that's great and all, but I sell physical goods, so I would then be taking a loss, every month, on each friend or family member who I'm giving away goods to.</p>

<p>I've also sent cold emails in the past, but it seems like this rarely resolves into anything interesting happening because the relationship is, well, cold.</p>

<p>Any suggestions as to how I can find the target market to offer value to? I guess another way to put this is:</p>

<p>How do I find the people who consider what I'm doing valuable?</p>
","<p>I just want to be very clear here --</p>

<p><strong>As a business owner/founder etc., it's your responsibility to design a product that <em>somebody needs.</em></strong></p>

<p>That being said, <em>what are you building and who are you building it for?</em></p>

<p>Clearly, if your business is designed correctly, you won't have to be <em>obnoxious</em> because your product is <em>beneficial.</em> The whole goal of marketing is to cast your finite-sized net and catch as many fish as possible. But if your net is too big, you'll just find that all the fish swim through it.</p>

<p>As far as I'm concerned, if you don't have a target market, you don't have a business.</p>

<p>Go back to the drawing board. If you already have a product, think about who your market is. If it's not built, consider building it specifically for that crowd.</p>

Within 5 years of founding the business in US, how did Uber expand so rapidly in international markets ? Uber is known to be aggressive in their business tactics but still given that their target market is transportation, it seems remarkable how they were able to grow in multiple countries rapidly. Specially, when compared to their competitors like Lyft and SideCar, Uber seems to be good at expanding into other countries.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I first used Uber in Seattle, and within a few months I was able to use it in Singapore and India. Are there some tactics or strategies they use in terms setting up offices, organizational structure and business model that enable them to expand rapidly.</p>
","<p>Uber began growing into foriegn markets not a long while after being founded as a company. They had a good team of translators and adapted their application to meet the needs of native people elsewhere (miles vs. kilometers). They also based their operations in each country in that country, and hired people from that area. Big cities like Shanghai, etc. They also acquired the former CEO of foreign growth at  Facebook, Ed Baker. You ideally should have a product/service that everybody needs, regardless of your ethnicity. Transportation is a huge sector that for a long time was not disrupted. Now it is. Uber's growing pains now involve dealing with lawsuits all over the world, as taxi unions get angry and governments sue them. When you get this big, you have to step away a little and let each regional office take over most of the operations in their area. Uber needs to take that agressive passion into things other than harassing journalists. However, their rapid growth may have just been a lucky ride, and they are not going anywhere.</p>

","<p>This was posted a reply to another <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/q/2/9"">question</a> and I think it still applies here even though the questions aren't quite the same. It's worth a full read, but the tl;dr for your situation is to really be considered founders they should all fully commit their time. Other assets like money or intellectual-property can be paid for later in cash.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This is such a common question here and elsewhere that I will attempt to write the world's most canonical answer to this question. Hopefully in the future when someone on answers.onstartups asks how to split up the ownership of their new company, you can simply point to this answer.</p>

<p>The most important principle: <strong>Fairness, and the perception of fairness, is much more valuable than owning a large stake</strong>. Almost everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong, and one of the biggest things that can go wrong is huge, angry, shouting matches between the founders as to who worked harder, who owns more, whose idea was it anyway, etc. That is why I would always rather split a new company 50-50 with a friend than insist on owning 60% because ""it was my idea,"" or because ""I was more experienced"" or anything else. Why? Because if I split the company 60-40, the company is going to fail when we argue ourselves to death. And if you just say, ""to heck with it, we can NEVER figure out what the correct split is, so let's just be pals and go 50-50,"" you'll stay friends and the company will survive.</p>

<p>Thus, I present you with <strong>Joel's Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup</strong>.</p>

<p>For simplicity sake, I'm going to start by assuming that you are not going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside investors. Later, I'll explain how to deal with venture capital, but for now assume no investors.</p>

<p>Also for simplicity sake, let's temporarily assume that the founders all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at the same time. Later, I'll explain how to deal with founders who do not start at the same time.</p>

<p>Here's the principle. As your company grows, you tend to add people in ""layers"".</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The top layer is the first founder or founders. There may be 1, 2, 3, or more of you, but you all start working about the same time, and you all take the same risk... quitting your jobs to go work for a new and unproven company.</p></li>
<li><p>The second layer is the first real employees. By the time you hire this layer, you've got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers--doesn't matter). These people didn't take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn't start the company, they joined it as a job.</p></li>
<li><p>The third layer are later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For many companies, each ""layer"" will be approximately one year long. By the time your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public or whatever, you probably have about 6 layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is larger. There might be two founders, five early employees in layer 2, 25 employees in layer 3, and 200 employees in layer 4. <strong>The later layers took less risk</strong>.</p>

<p>OK, now here's how you use that information:</p>

<p><strong>The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. Each of the next five layers should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer.</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two founders start the company. They each take 2500 shares. There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half.</p></li>
<li><p>They hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding.</p></li>
<li><p>They hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up.</p></li>
<li><p>By the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively. The earliest employees who took the most risk own the most shares.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Make sense? You don't have to follow this exact formula but the basic idea is that you set up ""stripes"" of seniority, where the top stripe took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least, and each ""stripe"" shares an equal number of shares, which magically gives employees more shares for joining early.</p>

<p>A slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority. Your top stripe is the founders, below that you reserve a whole stripe for the fancy CEO that you recruited who insisted on owning 10%, the stripe below that is for the early employees and also the top managers, etc. However you organize the stripes, it should be simple and clear and easy to understand and not prone to arguments.</p>

<p>Now that we have a fair system set out, there is one important principle. <strong>You must have vesting</strong>. Preferably 4 or 5 years. Nobody earns their shares until they've stayed with the company for a year. A good vesting schedule is 25% in the first year, 2% each additional month. Otherwise your co-founder is going to quit after three weeks and show up, 7 years later, claiming he owns 25% of the company. It <strong>never</strong> makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting. This is an extremely common mistake and it's terrible when it happens. You have these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for five years, and then you discover there's some jerk that quit after two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25% of the company for his two weeks of work.</p>

<p>Now, let me clear up some little things that often complicate the picture.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if you raise an investment?</strong> The investment can come from anywhere... an angel, a VC, or someone's dad. Basically, the answer is simple: the investment just dilutes everyone.</p>

<p>Using the example from above... we're two founders, we gave ourselves 2500 shares each, so we each own 50%, and now we go to a VC and he offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the company.</p>

<p>1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares. So you make another 2500 shares and give them to the VC. He owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd. That's all there is to it.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary?</strong> A lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money saved up, so she decides to go without a salary for a while, while the other founder, who needs the money, takes a salary. It is tempting just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up for it. The trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount of shares to give. This is just going to cause conflicts. <strong>Don't resolve these problems with shares</strong>. Instead, just keep a ledger of how much you paid each of the founders, and if someone goes without salary, give them an IOU. Later, when you have money, you'll pay them back in cash. In a few years when the money comes rolling in, or even after the first VC investment, you can pay back each founder so that each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the company.</p>

<p><strong>Shouldn't I get more equity because it was my idea?</strong> No. Ideas are pretty much worthless. It is not worth the arguments it would cause to pay someone in equity for an idea. If one of you had the idea but you both quit your jobs and started working at the same time, you should both get the same amount of equity. Working on the company is what causes value, not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower.</p>

<p><strong>What if one of the founders doesn't work full time on the company?</strong> Then they're not a founder. In my book nobody who is not working full time counts as a founder. Anyone who holds on to their day job gets a salary or IOUs, but not equity. If they hang onto that day job until the VC puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full time, they didn't take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive equity along with the first layer of employees.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods (patents, domain names, etc) to the company?</strong> Great. Pay for that in cash or IOUs, not shares. Figure out the right price for that computer they brought with them, or their clever word-processing patent, and give them an IOU to be paid off when you're doing well. Trying to buy things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality, arguments, and unfairness.</p>

<p><strong>How much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees?</strong> That depends on market conditions. Realistically, if the investors end up owning more than 50%, the founders are going to feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation, so good investors don't get greedy that way. If the company can bootstrap without investors, the founders and employees might end up owning 100% of the company. Interestingly enough, the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between investors and founders/employees; an old rule of thumb was that at IPO time (when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as you were going to raise) the investors would have 50% and the founders/employees would have 50%, but with hot Internet companies in 2011, investors may end up owning a lot less than 50%.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, but anything you can do to make it simple, transparent, straightforward, and, above-all, fair, will make your company much more likely to be successful.</p>

"Voting rights of a CEO","651","","<p>My friend and I created a product and now we want to turn it into a startup...myself and him are tech oriented so we would want to leave the CEO position for someone with a little more experience in the business side of things....</p>

<ul>
<li>Is is possible to appoint CEO ( mainly for title purposes ) but still retain the majority of the rights ( including voting rights ) as the 2 original co-founders? </li>
<li>Does the title of CEO automatically comes with 2 votes? </li>
<li>Are there any business models that allow for someone to be hired as CEO without the implied powers of it ( more of a operating title for external use...i.e. investors, PR...etc ) </li>
</ul>

<p>Any info would help. </p>
","<p>CEO's have a ""boss"" called ""the Board of Directors."" Directorship is not an easy task, and CEO's usually have no voting rights on the board. Although, frequently CEO's sit on boards and may even also be the chairperson.</p>

<p>CEO's do not vote on how to run the company. Directors usually do not tell them ""how to run the company."" In small companies these lines are usually very blurred, though.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors is responsible for representing shareholders. Shareholders vote on the board members. The board members vote on the CEO. The CEO runs the company. If you're worried about how a CEO ""votes"" then maybe this helps clarify how most companies are structured.</p>

<p>So... if you hire a CEO and that person has minority ownership of the company, then you can always vote them out. However, what's the point of having a CEO that you boss around? No CEO would really want the job (or do it very well) if their subordinates act as their boss. Also, then you really don't have a CEO, you have an employee or maybe a personal assistant. So you want to think carefully about how to structure this. From the sounds of it, you want a marketing and/or sales person, maybe not a CEO.</p>

<p>Even so, if you go down that road, a real world example of this is Yahoo - where the CEO is not the majority shareholder, but one of her subordinates is. And he's happy to be technical and let someone else ""run the business"" because he knows that protects his share value better than if he ran the business. And he focuses on technical problems, not finance, marketing, sales, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To specifically answer your 3 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>CEO's do not have voting rights. Voting rights are determined by share ownership.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no ""automatic voting system"" for CEO's. I further explain the role of CEO below. </p></li>
<li><p>CEO can be in title only. Some companies are run this way. Titles are merely to help other people understand who to talk to when problems or opportunities come up.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To try to clarify:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Businesses do not succeed if they are ""run by committee"" or else that is how businesses would work everywhere. Right now you sound like you are talking about ""votes"" to decide to take a particular action, decide product direction or even daily spending. That should not be voted upon. That is where a lot of startups end up in trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>The CEO's job is to make some of those decisions. That is the purpose of having a CEO. It requires a tremendous amount of trust and responsibility. However, early on especially, the CEO should heavily consider the consequences of <em>going against the expert opinion of another key officer</em>. Usually, CEO's listen carefully and closely to key people. They can't know everything, so they should rely on the expertise of those around them.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, the board will meet quarterly to assess the state of the company. It is at these times that they can vote on whether the CEO needs to be replaced. Usually, they will ask questions and provide feedback on their observations of the business activity (like, ""why did we not pursue XXX as a possibility? It seems to me that would have offered YYY benefit.""). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is what I mean by the ""board votes on the CEO"". Your question seems to frame the issue more like voting on a day-to-day basis for the direction of the product, etc. A good CEO will delegate authority where appropriate, but make decisions when they need to be made. If you think your opinion should ""override"" the CEO (or even both of your opinions when it comes to ""voting on issues""), then you have the authority of a CEO (or co-CEO's). As such you should not try to hire one because it will only frustrate them and you, most likely. </p>

<p>A well-seasoned startup CEO may understand their role to be more advisory, but that really sounds like a board member. In which case you should consider hiring board members.</p>

<p>Consider this example: Your CEO starts talking to investors. The investors get interested. Later, they find out you and your partner have ""all the voting rights"" - and really your CEO is just a ""figure head."" Now it gets complicated. The investor probably doesn't want to keep your CEO (they will want a real one). They have to now negotiate an investment (including determining the new voting structure based on share ownership) <em>AND</em> negotiate the termination or demotion of your so-called ""CEO"". It looks like you made things harder, not easier, for an investor.</p>

Equity, at least in our sense, is a buzz-word that indicates a portion of the company given in lieu of some or all immediate salary or wage, and it tends to occur near the beginning of the business's life as a means to pay people you couldn't otherwise afford to compensate effectively. Given that--albeit abstract--definition, I would say you should stop giving it as soon as you can pay people what you truly think they're <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/184/is-employee-value-derived-from-their-equity/186#186"">worth</a>. Now, for some, that might mean you keep giving them equity for a while longer. For others, it might not.</p>

<p>Of course, there's a totally different question of whether you should stop giving it in the technical sense, but that's really just a business decision. Many companies do give out stock options or even plain-and-simple stock as part of pay, and you might want to do that. I'm personally a fan of the idea because it drives employees to want their company to succeed without having to invest their time in forethought (which is surprisingly difficult for many people). But at that point it really depends on how your morale is doing, and consequently whether people will consider what you give them worth anything. The same is true for equity, but particularly once you're into the long-term ""I intend to pay people at least partially with shares"" mentality.</p>

<p>But each of those forms of giving away shares carries a different philosophy, and you have to decide when you're ready to abandon one and either roll into the next, or stop giving them away in general. Ultimately, I think new-hire equity is a great incentive at the start of a business to get people on board and excited, but once you start being self-sufficient, you should use it only as a reward for work well done. Microsoft, for random example, no longer needs to give out equity when people first join on just to get them excited. They can hold off and give out options (although I don't know if they do options any more) to good performers, who've earned that stake in the company.</p>

<p>You should also consider the implications of either starting or stopping the giving out of shares. If you currently have only given a few select employees equity in return for their great work and faith while you were kicking off a startup, but then you start giving just about everyone some, that might reduce the morale of your original employees. On the other hand, if you continue a while giving it out then stop, that could reduce the morale of your incoming ones.</p>

"Ethics of using fake user account to boost website image in the early stages","620","","<p>During the early stage of a website that is reliant on the website seeming well used with a large number of concurrent users online, would it be ""okay"" to fake those numbers?</p>

<p>Take a dating site as an example, you would not use one that you can tell is new with a low population, but you would if it had a seemingly large or average amount of users.</p>

<p>Is it ethical to create 100,000 user account or profiles in this case to boost the numbers to draw real people?</p>

<p>I understand that without the fake profiles actually doing anything or in this case replying to message sent to them by real people that the real people may not stick around for very long, but at least you had that user on-board and overtime as the real people start to grow in numbers that will become less of an issue.</p>
","<p>The vast majority of startups use at least one form of lying - using language in a way that encourages readers to draw the implication that there's a big team or/and user base or/and content repository. Or take the way Jess Farmer of Global Corporate Enterprise Consulting Solutions Group always says, ""we"" when she's the whole of the organisation.</p>

<p>In truth it's not a knock-down question either way. Neither ""no, you should never say anything that would lead someone to the wrong conclusion!"" nor ""yes, everybody does it, so get out there and lie to your heart's content!"" works out.</p>

<p>So you do need some kind of ethical framework. For me, the area that's at least in the gray zone is <strong>where the underlying promise is backed by a solid and realistic intent to deliver</strong>. If ""Yes, we have 24/7 support,"" means ""Yes, if you sign up, we'll create a 24/7 support service,"" then that's what salespeople do all the time with integrity.</p>

<p>Your challenge is that you have an offering that only starts to work for the user when you have lots of other users too, so I don't see how you can deliver on the implied promise. You can't sell me a ticket 100,001 to a party and when I walk through the door I find it's only me. That's an ethical problem, and it's a practical one. It's really, really hard to build a dating site one user at a time.</p>

<p>So I would look at two ways to go where the practical and the ethical can line up.</p>

<p>First, I don't have any issue with the lean approach that says, <strong>don't build the product until you craft the claim and gather data</strong>. So any number of sites out there are testing whether what they plan to make is going to be compelling. As long as it resolves quickly - join our beta wait list etc - then I'm good with that if it's justified. (If a solopreneur does it, fine, but not necessarily Google or Facebook.) Your dating site could be a private beta, or you could manage the experience so that you build in (say) a concierge element so that the first 14 days a user is registered, the focus is on helping them build a private profile, with a private Facebook share so that their friends can like and comment. </p>

<p>Second, <strong>lots of value propositions can be delivered at smaller scale</strong> than the founders are aiming. Your better-than Groupon site can start with a fanfare in Des Moines, because you found two local stores willing to give it a try. And you can probably think of a way to make your dating site create a positive user experience when it has a few hundred registered users, if those early users have a strong common interest.</p>

"Prepaid card/Scratch card process","601","","<p>Many companies have prepaid cards where it can either be magnetic or scratch cards with serial codes/pins. My question is what are the ways to achieve that if I were to use such system for my company? Most likely scratchcards. Be it:
 1. Hiring a card company to do that
 2. Buying a card printer to do it in-house etc</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons? Thanks ahead.</p>

<p>Edit:
For example,
     Customer buys a scratch card, he types in the PIN. That gives him some credit(virtual currency ) in our system and allows him to buy our products online. Famous example would be League of legends prepaid cards, gamestop gift cards etc. Note that I don't mean visa gift cards. This is only for one specific product / company. </p>
","<p>You're lucky that the scratchcard industry is very mature, so you can easily find companies that will offer you a full spectrum of choices from fully outsourced to totally in-house where you buy equipment, use your own code generators and distribute for yourself.</p>

<p>For most start-ups, I would recommend starting with outsourcing production, code generation and activation but managing distribution for yourself. That's because if nobody has heard of you yet, you are going to have to go direct to retailers and perhaps sell online until you build presence.</p>

<p>If you are inclined to manage the whole thing yourself, you need to be aware that the big stretch day one is risk management. Because a resold scratchcard has a monetary value as well as a value tied to your platform, your processes need to eliminate all major fraud and theft issues by design. The purchase of a capable security printer is only a small part of your total investment of time and cash this would entail.</p>

","<h2>Per <a href=""https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172494-why-arent-my-ads-receiving-impressions#"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter</a>:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Audience size too small</strong></p>
  
  <p>If you have uploaded a Tailored Audience list that has an audience

  <p>In the case that the matched audience is below the minimum tailored
  audience size of 500 active Twitter users, make sure that the original
  upload size is several times larger. It often takes thousands of
  entries just to match 500 users.</p>
  
  <p>Another potential solution is reach expansion, which lets an
  advertiser expand the reach of their campaign through lookalike
  modeling. Reach expansion is useful when the audience is relatively
  small, or any time an advertiser wants to drive more volume with their
  campaigns.</p>
  
  <p>Reach expansion is optional, and can be toggled on and off by the
  advertiser in Twitter Ads at will, for both new and currently-running

<p>Also I thought if some investors have paid X to get the shares, they wouldn't let an IPO happen below X, but clearly that also does not seem to be the case. Why?

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Common share prices are driven by supply and demand, not some absolute measure like the face value of individual preferred shares at some given point in time. You can however use the price of a preferred stock to infer a valuation for the company (after removing the debt component and any other special features).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>No.</strong> The IPO price will be based on the supply of and demand for the common shares floated. Again, individual stock prices cannot be viewed in absolute terms. The price of a stock depends on how many shares there are and how much demand there is for those shares. You can value a stock in a million ways, some smart and some not-so-smart, but at the end of the day what matters is what the market decides.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Comparing different rounds in such a simplistic way is comparing apples-to-oranges. You need to stop looking at share prices and start looking at the value of the company the shares imply. In the most elementary terms, [common shares outstanding x share price per share = company valuation]. (There are many other things to consider as well.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also I thought if some investors have paid X to get the shares, they wouldn't let an IPO happen below X, but clearly that also does not seem to be the case. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is true that having infinite money, any investor can manipulate the price of a stock to any degree he wants, investors would be foolish to blow good capital to set an artificial floor on the value of a company. At each pre-IPO round, the shareholders are given the opportunity to invest more to maintain their current percentage ownership. They can choose to exercise this option and invest more or they can choose to keep what they have and let the values of their shares dilute. The IPO will be priced based on the demand an investment bank finds for the shares. Now, the pre-IPO investors can decide to back out of the IPO if they feel the market is not providing enough and they can ""lock-in"" the idea of an artificial share value based on the most previous funding round -- but this does not reflect the true value of the shares they hold. What matters is always how much people are willing to pay for the full quantity of shares you want to sell in an IPO.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At time of IPO my understanding is that preferred stock gets converted into common stock. Is there a multiplier associated so that 1 preferred stock gets converted into 10 shares of common stock - that would be one way that would explain above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This all depends on the terms of the preferred shares. There are no hard rules though there are standards. Convertible shares by definition have to have a conversion ratio. They don't necessarily have to convert at the time of an IPO.</p>

"Is it possible to run an ""all remote worker"" company?","592","","<p>This is mainly for a tech startup, but:</p>

<p>As you begun hiring employees, if you didn't want to have to acquire a building and all of that, could you hire all of your employees remotely?</p>

<p>The general idea would be to interview them over Skype (or some similar service), and then send them the tools they would need (MacBook Pro), synchronize with them by using cloud services (Google Docs, Campfire, GitHub, etc.), possibly fly them down to one or two conferences a year (paid for by the company) and meet up there in addition to online meetings.</p>

<p>What might be some pros and cons of such an approach? Are there any specific things that ought to be watched out for?</p>
","<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost (low, highly competitive wages from a global model)</li>
<li>Less confrontational (easier process for removing bad or <em>output-lacking</em> employees)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Difficult management setup (particularly in scheduling, backlogs, and feedback loops)</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically frequent skepticism from peers (depending on who your peers are)</p></li>
<li><p>Less confrontational (also a con because lack of direct communication)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: I was reading back through my answer, and wanted to make an important distinction. I would argue it can potentially become cost-<em>ineffective</em> to run a remote model; if you don't tighten the system, you can dump lots of cash by failing to get your ideas through to your extended team.</p>

<p>These are my first thoughts regarding a remote-model. I've been working with multiple development teams in India as I myself am a US resident and company founder.</p>

<p>Important to note - managers will often have difficulty working on a similar schedule. As I am responsible for most mgmt operations in the USA and the entire development oversight, I have trouble getting respect from my coworkers as, in all reality, nobody has any idea what I do past 11PM (admittedly, there is an occasional glance at Startups SE).</p>

<p>This causes some interesting imbalances in respect I get from people - ""Oh, you work on with Indian developers? I hear ______""</p>

<p>The reality? India has more developers than anywhere in the world. Just means you may have to search better. It is as you've said, though: Skype interviews are a must. Get to know them as a person, but also as a professional. Do your best research with background checks and don't relinquish too much trust, even to very kind and seemingly-trustworthy individuals. You can easily get burned.</p>

<p>tl;dr Possible, but not for the weak minded</p>

<p>2nd Edit: It's also important to take into consideration I am from the USA. Cost for programming salaries tend to go Northern EU > USA > Argentina > India (many Americans prefer remote Argentina workers because of more aligned timezones). Just making the note that the cost variable is dependent on where your headquarters are.</p>

<p>All that matters in your startup company is that everyone is happy. <strong>a happy startup is a productive startup.</strong></p>

<p>In the end, you need to decide what you want. While its great to start a business with your buddies, it can lead to lots of troubles, and often they center around money, or control. </p>

<p>Things to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>How important is money to you?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If you're starting a business to earn lots of money, than the structure you have there is great, you'll earn 40% and 20% will be pushed back into the company. Remember though that it takes 1-3 years before startups start to ""make money"" (assuming they survive those first years). You're setup so that when you do finally expand, you'll have up to 60% of the profit, assuming you have a good business that could be lots of money. The disadvantages to this approach are that with money as your focus, you potentially sacrifice quality of your product, as well as employee loyalty. When they have to work for next to nothing for those first years, only to make a third of what you do in the end, it may be hard for them to continue, especially if they receive offers from outside.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>How important is having your friends there with you?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Do you want your friends there, or are they, put bluntly, a means to an end? If you want them to form the base of your future company (CFOs etc.) Then you may consider giving them a bigger portion of the company. If you want them to grow with the company, then treat them like you trust and respect them. </p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>How much work will your friends be doing?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The last factor to think about is how much of the work they will be doing. From what you said, it sounds like you'll be doing the bulk of the work. Do you really need two marketers where you'll be the only developer? Will they be doing something else in addition to sales? What will their average day look like compared to yours? If you're working 12-18 hour days, and they are working 6-10, you obviously deserve more. On the other hand, if they are constantly out there selling, even when they aren't ""on the clock"" They deserve more. </p>

<p>All in all, you need to figure out what they're worth to the company, and what you're worth. Remember ideas are worthless, so just because you came up with it, that means nothing. Work, progress, and in the end money from sales are what matter. I would suggest a 30-25-25-20 split where you get 35% and the company 20%, but you need to figure out whats the best approach for you, and your company.</p>

<p>I am a programmer, but haven't done much web-programming. However, my idea would need a specific web-site. At the moment, this is a single-person company. Since a few weeks already, I'm </p>

<ul>
<li>trying to figure out which frameworks would match </li>
<li>how fast I can understand the concepts</li>
<li>how active the community reacts on questions and bugs</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course I have already limited the number of frameworks by requirements such as</p>

<ul>
<li>has REST support</li>
<li>provides database mapping</li>
<li>is free (open source)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily but also unfortunately, there are so many web frameworks available, it's not just a matter of deciding between a small number of frameworks. Since I'm employed in parallel (full time), I evaluate frameworks in my free time only, which takes long.</p>

<p>I also doubt that I explain my situation to a consultant and let him decide. The consultant will also have limited knowledge and potentially recommend a framework that he's most familiar with (""golden hammer"" advice).</p>

<p>I already tried to add more requirements, but it starts becoming artificial and maybe I exclude a good framework that way.</p>
","<p>Always the popular one. Think about it in terms of input and output. What input goes into learning a new web framework? Learning and coding. Choose the one that is most popular because it'll make both of those tasks way easier, which in turn will fuel your output.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you should choose Ruby on Rails or Node.js. These frameworks have large communities, so if you hit a programming problem, or need guidance, or a dependent library, you'll have the most success with either of these. </p>

<p>EDIT:   </p>

<p>I'm amazed I see an answer that states ""it ultimately doesn't matter most likely"":</p>

<p>That's just wrong. Of course it matters. Let's go over some real world problem solving:</p>

<ul>
<li>When it comes time to deploy, how easy is to deploy your language? With Ruby, node.js, php, or java, deployment is easy over Heroku. Deciding to go with cool, niche language? Have fun deploying it yourself. </li>
<li>When it comes time to hunt down a bug, how many other people have probably gotten the same one? With the popular language, you can probably google your error code or whatever question you're having and find many resources. With cool, niche language, you're going to have to hunt that down yourself</li>
<li>When it comes time to create a new feature, how many other people have created something like it and have written blog posts, guides, or even wrote completely dedicated libraries to the very feature you're looking for? With popular language, probably a lot of people.</li>
<li>When it comes time to expand, how many people will be familiar with cool, niche language vs popular language? How will this impact hiring?</li>
<li>When it comes time to ask the community about something you just can't understand, how wide will your listening audience be? </li>
</ul>

<p>And so on and so on... At the end of the day, if you're intent on building a product and shipping it, you go with the safe, popular choice because you're trying to avoid unnecessary risk. Choosing a niche framework is just that -- an unnecessary risk. </p>

"What happens to cash in the bank after an acquisition?","569","","<p>Suppose a startup received some seed funding, but for one reason or another couldn't make a sale or grow, and at the end of a year or two had a waning $X remaining in the bank. But the entrepreneurs are fairly talented and have some decent IP, so they receive an offer to sell their company to join Google or Facebook or Hoolie for some small multiple of (let's say 2 or 3 times) $X plus a salary. </p>

<p>Obviously acquisition contracts can be very flexible, but who would typically get the banked cash and how does this affect the valuation?</p>
","<p>Money in the bank is an asset just like any other tangible asset. Typically in an acquisition, the assets that are transferred to the purchasing company are outlined in the purchase contract. For money in the bank (just like debts), this is usually used to satisfy any open debt first, including payroll, accounts payable, and other real debt. After that what is left in the bank account is part of the purchase (usually). </p>

<p>Think of the money as the property of the company, not its partners. Usually a purchase contract includes all the debts and assets, so this gets transferred in the sale.</p>

<p>As far as how it affects valuation, again its an asset just like any other asset, although in your hypothetical case I would assume that the cash in the bank would be a smaller part of the valuation versus the value placed on the IP. Usually when making an acquisition, the purchasing company doesn't pay N times $X bank account balance, there are a lot of other factors in play. </p>

<p>The case that you provided would be highly unlikely, a start-up that has money after 2 years of no sales and no growth. They would probably be purchased for the value of the debts plus employment contracts and I would guess that nothing would be left in the bank account at that point.</p>

"How and to whom do you communicate a very ambitious vision?","567","","<p>I have a very ambitious vision for our little startup. Now I am afraid to sound unrealistic, detached or like a romancer. I do not want to lose credibility with possible employees and investors, especially since I have nothing to show right now.</p>

<p>So my question is: How and to whom do I communicate such a vision? Do I keep it hidden until I have some first results to show that it is not completely unrealistic? Do I show it only to employees to motivate them? Do I use it as a slogan?</p>

<p>When Microsoft wanted a PC in every home in 1975, this was very ambitious. And as far as I know, they didn't communicate this goal to their customers...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify matters, I am not talking about the idea (which should be freely communicated to everybody) but about the greater vision, which is enabled by the idea. For example: </p>

<p>Idea: Internet-/crowd-based encyclopedia. </p>

<p>Vision: Gather all of humanities knowledge in one place and make it freely accessible.</p>

<p>Now that Wikipedia is 13 years old, this vision is almost reality. Before the first entry, things were quite different... and one could have been laughed at for making such an ambitious claim.</p>
","<p>The clearer you can communicate your vision, the more the idea of the startup makes sense to potential customers, employees, and shareholders. Having a grand (and clear!) vision lets you be more specific in what you do and what you don't do. It can help you, your employees, and everyone around you make better small-term decisions that line up with you long term vision.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> (<a href=""http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/coca-cola-great-britain/within-an-arms-reach-of-desire/introduction.html"">http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/coca-cola-great-britain/within-an-arms-reach-of-desire/introduction.html</a>)</p>

<p>The vision of Coca Cola is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always a Coke within arm's reach of desire</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound like an ambitious challenge for even the greatest companies, but it helps drive their business decisions on every level. From marketing (""Always...""), to manufacturing and distribution, all the way up to the executive level.</p>

<p>In short, having this grand vision is a great asset to have and a lot of companies have faded away with a lack of a clear, long-term vision. Use it to your advantage at every opportunity you have!</p>

<p>If you give away your credentials to your Team Agent account, you basically grant them full access to everything, which definitely is not what you (should) want. As an example, as Team Agent they could probably transfer all your apps to an account of their own!

"Use of youtuber in brand name","525","","<p>I would like to use the word ""Youtuber"" in my branding.  I am wondering if this could cause any legal issues? </p>

<p>The word is not used by youtube in their own branding, but is widely used in popular culture.</p>

<p>I was able to find this document <a href=""https://developers.google.com/youtube/branding_guidelines"">https://developers.google.com/youtube/branding_guidelines</a>.  The word ""youtuber"" is not mentioned, but it does have a section on using variants such as ""YT"".</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience or advice on this matter?  </p>
","<p>I wouldn't.</p>

<hr />

<p>From the document you linked,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important: You must never use the YouTube name or any abbreviation, acronym, or variant of the word YouTube, <strong>such as</strong> YT or You-Tube in conjunction with the overall name of your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine. As you said, ""YT"" is given as an example, but only as an example. There are dozens of variations you could use that would infringe their trademark, and I'd heavily guess that ""Youtuber"" would count.</p>

<hr />

<p>Protection by trademarks is kind of a funky deal. I don't know how much of this you already know going in, but at a high level, trademarks are used to protect consumers. Unlike some other forms of intellectual property protection, which focus on the protection of inventors or artists, trademarks' main purposes are to stop people from being confused about where a product is coming from.</p>

<p>One of many standard examples that I tend to cite is if a high-end restaurant opened with the name ""McDonald's."" People would go there expecting very cheap food and be disappointed, and people would go to the fast-food restaurant expecting very high-end food and be disappointed. That's what trademarks are meant to protect: for better or worse, they give consumers a hint about what they should expect from a business.</p>

<p>Now, as we all know, ""confusion"" is a pretty subjective thing. And just like pretty well any division of the law, nobody can really claim to be the definitive source of whether the courts will uphold something. That's why I say ""I'd heavily guess"" it would count. It's hard to say what Google, the courts, or consumers would think.</p>

<p>But looking at the name ""Youtuber,"" and knowing how people sometimes are, I'd expect a fair number of people would think it came directly from YouTube, and therefor you could get in trouble for using it.</p>

<p>From a more logical (in the academic sense of the word) perspective, if your name contains the word ""Youtuber,"" it will also contain the word ""YouTube."" Given ""you must never use the YouTube name...in conjunction with the overall name...,"" that would be a pretty direct infringement.</p>

<p>I suppose it should be noted that, once in force, the standard for proving infringement of a trademark is a little higher. Google would have to seek you out and actively prove to courts that people <em>were</em> confused by your use of their name. All these hypotheticals are more or less irrelevant. But in reality, again, if you have a direct copy of their distinctive trademark in your name, that's unlikely to be too difficult.</p>

<p>And in any event, it's unlikely that they'd allow you in the Google Play store with that name. So take that how you will.</p>

<hr />

<p>The only way I can really imagine if you held a stake would be if you were already using the name YouTuber before they started using their trademark.</p>

<p>It's true that heavy use in pop-culture could be a factor to invalidating their hold on it, but just as Google still manages to hold their primary trademark in light of many people saying ""I'll Google that,"" it's unlikely that they'll let go of YouTube that easily, or this early. Note, as well, that if Google starts to ""let things slide"" in this arena, that will also be a factor in their loss of the trademark. So it's unlikely that they'll take the non-enforcement route if they learn about it.</p>

<hr />

<p>But realistically, it all just depends on likelihood of confusion, and how you intend to use it. If it's in your name, I wouldn't. If you just want to mention ""Founded by a YouTuber"" in some text, that might be okay. It all depends.</p>

"How to efficiently calculate the Average Run Rate?","522","","<p>Annual <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/runrate.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Run Rate</a> is a metric which would help the company to set its targets, by extrapolating current trends and results.</p>

<p>And it's calculation is also very tricky(even more if your business has seasonal effects). So, are there any standard ways/techniques which can help startups calculate ARR efficiently, keeping their trends and patterns of sales in mind?</p>

<p>And why should we calculate Annual run Rate of Recurring Revenue vs Time Period (segmented with respect to churn)?  What can be learned from this analysis?  (<a href=""http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUsKv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUsKv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>As i wrote in a comment, this topic is quite complex. I only scratched the surface, but I tried to name as many things as possible, without getting to far away from the answer.</p>

<p>The first thing is, if it is even necessary to do this calculations as a startup. So first question should be ""When should I do advanced calculations?"". The answer is as short as simple: Do it, when you want/need to sell your company. If not, try to find some key figures for measurement. (That still could be over management, but in terms of growth it could be very interesting)</p>

<p>Let's assume, we want to create a model for StartUps. (This will not be complete, but it should be way more accurate). </p>

<p>First thing is: Run Rate has high error acceptance. That's why it is accepted to  to have a linear growth, without limits and all those quite overestimating predictions. <a href=""http://seanonstartups.co/2014/07/10/the-run-rate-trap/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Take a look here</a>.</p>

<p>Now lets try to develop some figures, so we will be more accurate. First thing to mention is, that those high run rate startups estimate their turn over, the customer amounts etc. Of course most estimations are based on numbers, but there is an uncertainty variable coming with it. (<a href=""http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/06/what-is-startup.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Take a look here</a>) Only a very small minority will reach half of their predictions. And the amount meeting their predictions... well lets just say, there is a reason to call them unicorns.</p>

<p>Lets get going:</p>

<p>The normal run rate is very simple to calculate. Take your actual revenue or earnings and multiply them by the time period (earnings in January = 10000,; Prediction over 12 month) : RunRate = 10.000€ * 12 = 120.000€</p>

<p>Now lets take the growth rate in account, here lets say we have a percentage growth of 10% per year: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q5hrh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q5hrh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Remember that this run rate will be even higher, as the run rate w/o growth</p>

<p>For functional notations of the seasonal part, my math is not good enough, but it is simple excel work. I created a sample document. </p>

<p>Here we guess the amount of customers and their changing rates, especially the mostly ignored chrun rate (+ some other variables). You also can set relative changes depending on seasons. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W8AdCzZj_r2Sl6NPRx04fs5kq4QkV7l3kGYimxYIaBg/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Take a look here</a></p>

<p>Implications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Season can have an impact, but needs to be quite strong</li>
<li>Run Rate is no tool for estimations or predictions. It's a metric to compare and evaluate</li>
<li>In startups with growth potential, growth should be considered.</li>
<li>To get an more realistic insight, also include the chrun rate</li>
</ul>

<p>What does the graph display? </p>

<ul>
<li>Green Line: Every time period you earn some money. If nothing changes over X time periods you will have earned X times that value. (... and by that ignoring so may things)</li>
<li>Blue Line: Wait... that can't be accurate! Think about it: You spent 1000$ to attract 20 Customers per time period, but if you spent 2000$ you may get 31 (it is NOT doubled). But you will also loose 15% of your customers per time period. That means for the first time period: If you have 100 Customers you will loose 15%, but with your marketing you will get 20 new ones. => Growth of 5 Yay!
For the second time period: you will again get 20 new ones, but you will lose 16. => Growth of 4 Meh!. So your growth is not linear, it decreases over time!</li>
<li>Red Line: It tells you that there is a border, you can't exceed. I theory, you can, but in reality your marketing costs would explode. So the red line, represents a limit!</li>

<p>So how can an individual possibly start a company if doesn't have enough capital?</p>
","<p>I don't want to be the harsh one here, but let me be the realist.</p>

<p>Every business <em>needs</em> capital or <em>freedom (time)</em> to operate. </p>

<p>Take my instance for example. In starting my company, I was <em>only</em> able to continue developing the product because I was willing to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Work for free</li>
<li>Work with no promise for payment</li>
<li>Convince others than working for no payment (this is <em>sweat equity</em>) was viable and even a <em>good opportunity</em></li>
<li>Partner with someone who had access to funds through his various networks</li>
<li>Avoid the <em>wretched catch 22</em> that is startup funding</li>
</ol>

<p>Just remember - nobody is going to always pay your bills just because of an idea in your brain. People want promise.</p>

<p>Crowd-funding is great, but software applications can't be crowd-funded on Kickstarter (I've seen some exceptions), and investors rarely invest until you have a market share. </p>

<p>EDIT: Several applications may evade this clause: <em>Kickstarter is for projects that can be completed, not things that require maintenance to exist. This means no e-commerce sites, web businesses, or social networking sites. (Yes, this means Kickstarter wouldn’t be allowed on Kickstarter. Funny, but true.)</em></p>

<p>Just a few of my thoughts. You truly have to survive as a sheep among wolves until you're strong enough to fend for yourself.</p>

"Earning money with apps?","520","","<p>I've just rolled out my new android app, which I've created spending hours and hours in front of my screen (as I'm not that long in this business). <br />Now, I'm offering in-app purchases, like the player (yes it's a game) can play level 1 and he can unlock level 2 &amp; 3 by spending (in my opinion) a tiny little amount of 1$. In addition, I'm also monetizing my app with 2 ads in it. </p>

<p>The last 2 days, 200 users have played my app per day, and none bought it and the ads just made like 0.2$ per day.<br /> 
But these 200 Users came from my ads on facebook, which I bought there, If I didn't bought it, I think noone would have ever noticed my app. I'm paying 0.1$ for a new user, that's not much, but if noone buys the game or the ads are not being clicked, I'm not earning money..? </p>

<p>Can you tell me where I can learn promoting an app correctly and perhaps tell me what is actually going on at the moment?<br /> 
I see apps with 100 thousand downloads in the store without doing in-app purchases, why can they do such things, and how did they get so many downloads?</p>
","<p>Rule #1 of marketing is to make a product that doesn't suck. No amount of marketing will help if your app sucks. And the best way to know if a game sucks or not is to test-drive it by handing it to the youngest kids that might end up using it.</p>

<p>To give a short example, my wife and I recently visited friends who had a 4 year old son. I re-installed Cut the Rope on my tablet so he could play.</p>

<p>When I initially purchased Cut the Rope in 2010, it was a seamless and remarkable playing experience. I gave it a well deserved 5/5 rating back then, and the game kept a number of kids busy and engaged for afternoons on end until I deleted the app.</p>

<p>Upon re-installing it, I passed the iPad without much second thoughts. I was speechless a few minutes later. The app was bubbling with obnoxious prompts to buy other apps, prompts to get power-ups using in-app purchases, and what have you. I had to disable in-app purchases and step him through how to go ignore the prompts so he could play unsupervised. And it was so bad that I was tempted to pop into the App Store to slap a big fat 1/5 review on it for the trouble.</p>

<p>It got worse. When my tablet's battery ran out, his father downloaded Cut the Rope 2 Free on his own tablet so the kid could continue playing. Big mistake.</p>

<p>The UX was abysmal. Between the full screen video ads, the all too big and misplaced restart level button that the kid systematically tapped because the next level button wasn't grabbing his attention, the forced discovery of features and power-ups that interrupted game play, the in your face in-app purchases, and the need to tap on a map to access the next level (something which he couldn't grasp), it was simply hopeless.</p>

<p>Someone out there might be making data-driven decisions and a bit more money on the app. Perhaps even a lot more. But my own rating would have been 1/5, and I doubt I'll ever purchase anything made by Zeptolabs again.</p>

<p>With that said, back to you: test your app's UX.</p>

<p>Really... Hand it over to the youngest kid that might play it, to verify that it does NOT suck.</p>

<p>Observe the kid playing for a half hour or so without any help. Then run home and fix everything that obviously needs attention. Rinse and repeat. Run this test with as many new kids as necessary, until they're at home using the app.</p>

<p>It might take you a few weeks of work, but it'll be well worth it: your app usage will increase by orders of magnitude and word of mouth will kick in.</p>

<p>For the rest, it's the usual stuff. Off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make a website that showcases your app, with good copy and that oft-requested but oh-so-often-missing gameplay video.</p></li>
<li><p>Get reviews on game review sites, post it to mobile gaming forums, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Get reviews on mom-at-home sites and what have you that your buyers (read: bored moms at home and geek parents) and end-users (read: bored moms at home, bored adolescents, and commuting parents) might be visiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Run some FB ads. ($0.10 is super cheap, go for it once you get conversion right.)</p></li>
<li><p>Using ads with an in-app purchase to get rid of them makes you look cheap. In-app purchases to go deeper into the app (chapter 2, chapter 3, and beyond) make you look premium. Imo, pick one; not both.</p></li>
<li><p>One-time use in-app purchases make you look greedy and cheesy but they're the most lucrative.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The list could go on. But whatever you do, fix the UX first to ensure your app doesn't suck.</p>

"How can you prevent two founders from selling 99% of the equity to another company that they own to dilute the equity of a third founder?","520","","<p>If a startup has three founders, A, B, and C, with each 1000 shares (so each own 33%), could A and B decide to create a million new shares and selling them for pennies to another company that they own? C would then be left with only +/- 0.001% of the original company, and through their other company, A and B would own 99.99% together instead of 66%.</p>

<p>This might seem a bit farfetched, but still, is it legal? If yes, how can C protect himself?</p>
","<p>What you describe is not far fetched and can occur fairly commonly. </p>

<p>In the example, since share price would depend on the value of the company, creating the new shares without changing the value of the company would dilute the value of the existing shares including the ones owned by A and B. Ownership stake would not change until the new shares are sold. When the new stock is offered for sale, C has the option to buy it just as  A and B or the second company owned by A and B. If C is unable to buy more and doesn't want to reduce the stake C can vote to block the sale in the board but would get outvoted by A and B. </p>

<p>Share authorization, issue and sale is governed usually by the articles of incorporation, corporate bylaws and shareholder agreements. In case of founders you can have a founders agreement as well. </p>

<p>A simple way to protect that would be to add a clause into the bylaws stating that new share authorizations, issue and sale must be unanimously voted by board of directors. You can also restrict sale of shares to companies owned by shareholders where the ownership stake in these companies is more than a particular percent. More commonly, there would be whats called an anti dilution provision which lets investors protect their equity. There are many types of this provision some giving them right to buy new stock at particular prices or in particular quantities. Founders can also create preferred stock with specific restrictions on sale to non founders and different voting rights to maintain control. </p>

<p>If there is a founders agreement, you can state that shares would not be sold without discussion or without first offering to the founders. Many investors these days would insist on a vesting schedule for founders to prevent the founders from exiting the company early before the investments have been recovered. </p>

<p>The exact legality of what you describe may depend on the state the corporation is registered in as there maybe government laws on anti dilution and preemptive rights for existing shareholders that all corporations have to abide by. A good lawyer from the state or the SBDC maybe able to give you exact information. </p>

<p>You can look at the articles of big corporations like Google or Facebook to see how they prevent this and on anti dilution clauses. </p>

<li>Our operative (local) costs are calculated so we are charging a small benchmark on the sum of costs (local-operation and third-party services).</li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>
","<p>For a project-focused company (as your comment clarifies), customers often value fixed price / fixed outgoings agreements. So I would start by looking how to price those.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed price agreements</strong> have at their core a scope document, list of deliverables, delivery schedule, acceptance criteria and payment schedule. From a pricing point of view, your upper bound is your best answer to the question, ""what value does the client place on this project?"" and the lower bound is either ""what's my lowest risk-free cost?"" or ""what's my lowest cost, factoring in a risk premium?""</p>

<p>Because you're aiming to lower the cost of quality, but not to compete with full offshoring, you want to add in some more measures. The ""cost plus reasonable return"" for a local provider is another figure you want to come in significantly below, and the credible lowest quote is a figure you want to be significantly above.</p>

<p>So your pricing strategy job is to try and characterise these figures and the relationship between them, to inform the front end of your business. It may be that for the kind of work you're likely to be asked to look at, you're boxed in to a fairly narrow range, then you can use the headline messages (significantly cheaper than local providers, better than offshore) as part of your pitch, because your discretion is small. If on the other hand there's a bigger range, then good pricing is a combination of a simple positioning that keeps you competitive and profitable, plus a negotiating framework that allows you to win business profitably at other price points. </p>

<p>In fixed price, early days you're likely to be back-to-backing customer and suppklier agreements, but as you grow in experience you have the opportunity to improve profitability by absorbing more of the risk as you become better able to manage it from your vantage point between the client and the main delivery team.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed outgoings agreements</strong> sometimes come in with agile practice, with a fixed price per unit of time, or less often price per feature or price per some other measurable item. You're still likely to find most or all of the trappings of traditional projects, because commercial practice is slow to change. Just be careful that you aren't caught out by acceptance criteria that don't line up with the flexibility of an agile project.</p>

<p>This is definitely an area where I would encourage you to price on a ""value minus"" basis, where you are clear how the project will drive value for the client, and the ""minus"" is the lowest percentage that reflects a clear return for the client plus a clear price advantage over local providers. That fits my rule that ""the best price is the highest effective price."" </p>

<p>Pitching profitably while giving the customer great value gives you more opportunities to over-deliver value through the project, increasing the chance of follow-on work or of being exposed to other opportunities.</p>

"How do I give money to my own company?","517","","<p>I have an S-Corp formed in Illinois with a minimal amount of stock all owned by myself.  I have no employees.</p>

<p>Once I have given my company money, is that reported as paid-in capital to the state?</p>
","<p>Money coming into the company from founders would usually be marked as an investment in the form of paid in capital or capital contribution.

Non cash assets would appear on the balance sheet with the asset valued at a fair market value. Usually this is reported via financial statements. State reporting for paid in capital may vary and is best to check the state regulations. It looks like the IRS wants the 1120SK-1 forms for reporting shareholder details for S-Corps.

"How to allocate shares?","517","","<p>We are 4 friends and have newly founded a private tech company, worked hard on its technology details and focused mainly on design and production. Now we want to decide about some financial things. We have nearly spent $ 30,000 , and there's $ 10,000 remained in our bank account. (We have used our life savings and family borrowings mostly.)</p>

<p>Our company is limited, not public. So we are not currently in any stock market.</p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>We had initially allocated percentages to each founder, say e.g. 25% for each of 4 founders. But recently we have decided to allocate shares instead. Because the shares are unlimited and can increase. Is this way of thinking correct? What are the pros and cons of each?</li>
<li>If we decide to allocate <strong><em>shares</em></strong> or <strong><em>stocks</em></strong> to each founder, how can we determine the initial number of shares, their values and their dividends?</li>
<li>We want to hire some other people (mostly from close friends) to work for our company. But we cannot afford to pay salaries for them at the moment. So we want to offer them some shares. How can we determine the number or percentage of their shares?</li>
<li>Let's say we successfully allocated e.g. 1000 shares among 10 people (including founders and staff). Now how does the process of creating new shares work? Let's say, after 2 months, one person wants to buy some of our shares. How do we create new shares? Can we create and sell unlimited number of shares?</li>
<li>Can the company declare that the number of shares cannot increase for the next 6 months?</li>
<li>Let's say we allocated 1000 shares of $1 value each. Now what? Do we have to pay dividends to shareholders? Or can we give them more shares instead of dividends?</li>
<li>Can a shareholder say ""I don't want these shares anymore. Give my money back."" !!? And if yes, what do we have to do? Do have to pay him/her the value of his/her shares in cash? And if yes, what happens to those shares? Do we have to delete them?</li>
<li>Let's imagine we are working on 2 different projects at the company. Can we split the type of their shares? Can we say this share A belongs to the profits of project A, and share B to project B? Or do we have to found another company for project B to do so!?</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry for asking silly and weird question. I'm e newbie to financial rules.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and help.</p>
","<p>Good questions here. I'll speak from the UK point of view and someone from the US can add nuances for the local tax laws.</p>

<p>You will <strong>issue</strong> a number of shares in a company; I think our company has 10,000. These are the <strong>allocated</strong> to individuals who are then shareholders; we have about 400 shares allocated. Shares that are not allocated are not owned by anyone, but are unallocated in their ownership.</p>

<p>I think it is prudent to have a share (not sure if 'stock' and 'share' are interchangeable, 'share' is the normal term in the UK) ownership to describe the percentage of the company owned. This is especially important when you are considering allowing more people to have a shareholding. </p>

<p>I would go for larger numbers of shares allocated rather than smaller numbers of shares, as then it is easier to allow small stakes to be sold/given. e.g. If each of the four founders had 1 share each, then you can only give one share, so you are massively diluting the four founders' shareholdings. Better is 1,000 shares each, then you can choose to give a new minority shareholder just 10 shares, or someone you want to engage more, 100 shares.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a shareholders agreement signed by all shareholders. </p>

<p>I would (if your local laws allow for it) create different classes of share. e.g. Class A shares are only owned by the founders and are voting shares, Class B shares are non voting shares, but are equal in all other respects. This stops a number of small shareholders having the 'casting vote' in a shareholders meeting.</p>

<p>With regard to your question 'How can we determine the number or percentage of their shares?', This depends on what proportion of the future company you want to give away. Build some excel models on various 'what if' situations. Include different amounts of dividends in these calculations.</p>

<p>With regard to your question 'Can we create and sell unlimited number of shares?', you can allocate any number of issued shares, so it will be up to whatever you have issued. Im certain there is a process for issuing more shares, but I can't comment.</p>

<p>The company (shareholders with a vote) can declare that there will be no new shares allocated in a fixed period.</p>

<p>Regarding dividends, they are declared on <strong>profits</strong>. As a company you can choose to invest profits back into the company or declare some of the profits as a dividend.</p>

<p>There will be a nominal value assigned to shares and also a 'market' value, if shares are gifted there may be some personal tax liability to the individual receiving them. The 'market' value of the shares can be derived by a number of means, which will give different results. Here are a few ways. I'm no expert in this area, this is just from my understanding. (I would expect there is a good answer in SE somewhere, but couldn't find it with a cursory check)</p>

<ul>
<li>Use 'net present value'. Trouble is that ignores any IP you have and good will.</li>
<li>Value the business on the basis of past sales. Use a multiplier for repeat business (between 2 and 10) and multiplier of 1 for one off consulting business. e.g. If you have some long term contracts worth £100,00/year with a good profit margin on them it might be deemed to have a multiplier of 5, then additionally you might do an extra £200,000 of consulting work in a year, so your total valuation is £700,000.</li>
<li>What assets do you have? Depending on the type of business this can have an effect?</li>
<li>Discounted cash flow - what dividends are you expecting to declare for the next 10-15 years?</li>
<li>Are you a online product based business, this may induce your multiplier to be higher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding 'Can a shareholder say ""I don't want these shares anymore. Give my money back.""?' ... that is tricky. That is one reason to have a shareholders agreement so that everyone knows where they stand and knows the process by which they can sell their shares. Often shares will be sold back and split among the existing founders, if they don't want them, then the company will purchase them back. you then get into the issue of what the shares are 'worth'. That's really tricky and I'm going to sidestep that (maybe ask that question to SE separately).</p>

<p>Regarding your last question 'Let's imagine we are working on 2 different projects at the company.', in the UK having different classes of shares for different people/projects so they can be paid differently is viewed poorly by the HMRC, I would ask about the bigger picture, why is it important to do that? If it is necessary, then perhaps a second company with a different shareholding split. That gets a big complicated to manage, especially if you have an increasing number of projects. There will be company 'control' issues that need to be considered to make it tax efficient. This is something you should get legal and tax advice over - note I say both legal <strong>and</strong> tax, since they often come at things from different perspectives.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

"Checklist before hiring first employee?","514","","<p>I have been flying solo up until now, but am at a point where the amount of work is more than one person can realistically handle (at least to do it well) and the revenue justifies adding on an hourly employee.</p>

<p>I have never hired anyone before though, so I want to make sure all of my ducks are in a row before taking that step.</p>

<p>What all do I need to have in place <strong>both legally</strong> (workers comp, unemployment insurance, etc) <strong>and practically</strong> (such as training for the specific tasks the employee will be doing).</p>

<p>If it makes a difference, the work being done is not a particularly skilled task (doesn't require years of experience or a college degree) but it will require some training. It will be an hourly wage not a salary, and I don't intend to give any equity or really offer any special benefits at this point - it's an entry level position with an average wage for that type of job in the area we're in.</p>

<p>The business is located in the United States - specifically we are in Oklahoma. </p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/hiring-first-employee-13-things-29463.html"">Here</a> is a great article that clearly outlines what needs to be done. Since its a crappy website, I'll list the 13 items here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Obtain an employer identification number.</strong>
When you hire employees, you must get an employer identification number (EIN) to use on tax returns and other documents you submit to the IRS. To get an EIN, you must file IRS Form SS-4. You can download the form from the IRS website at www.irs.gov.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Register with your state's labor department.</strong>
Once you bring on employees, you will have to pay state unemployment compensation taxes. These payments go to your state's unemployment compensation fund, which provides short-term relief to workers wholose their jobs. Go to <a href=""http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/map.asp"">http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/map.asp</a> for a list of state unemployment insurance tax agencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get workers' compensation insurance.</strong>
You should have workers' comp coverage to protect workers who might suffer on-the-job injuries. Workers' comp insurance is required in the vast majority of states, although some make an exception for very small employers. For more information on workers' compensation laws, see The Manager's Legal Handbook, by Lisa Guerin and Amy DelPo (Nolo).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set up a payroll system to withhold taxes.</strong>
You'll need to withhold a portion of each employee's income and deposit it with the IRS, and also make Social Security and Medicare tax payments to the IRS. For more information, get IRS Publication 15, Circular E, Employer's Tax Guide from the IRS website at www.irs.gov. (You may also have to withhold taxes for your state. For more information, check with your state's tax agency; you can find links to each state's agency at the website of the Federation of Tax Administrators at www.taxadmin.org/fta/link.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have each employee fill out IRS Form W-4, Withholding Allowance Certificate.</strong>
On the W-4 form, employees tell you how many allowances they are claiming for tax purposes, so that you can withhold the correct amount of tax from their paychecks. (You don't have to file the form with the IRS.) You can find this form at www.irs.gov. You should ask employees to fill out a new W-4 form each year if they want to change their allowances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fill out Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification for each new employee.</strong>
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly known as the INS) requires employers to use this form to verify that every employee they hire is eligible to work in the United States. (You don't have to file this form with the USCIS, but you must keep it in your files for three years and make it available for inspection by officials of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.) You can obtain the form online at www.uscis.gov. Note that these filled out forms should be kept in a separate I-9 folder for all employees -- not in each employee's personnel file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Report each new employee to your state's new hire reporting agency.</strong>
The new hire reporting program requires employers to report information on all new employees for the purpose of locating parents who owe child support. Each state has a different new hire reporting agency. To find the name and address of your state's new hire reporting agency,see the State New Hire Reporting page at the Administration for Children &amp; Families website (www.acf.hhs.gov).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post required notices.</strong>
Several government agencies require employers to post notices providing information on worker rights for their employees. For information on required federal posters, go to the Department of Labor website at www.dol.gov/elaws/posters.htm. The DOL's ""Poster Advisor"" will help you determine which posters you must display in your workplace. In addition, you must comply with your state department of labor's poster requirements. A list of state departments of labor is included on the federal Department of Labor's website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File IRS Form 940 each year.</strong>
You must file IRS Form 940 to report your federal unemployment tax for any year in which you paid wages of $1,500 or more in any quarter or for any year in which an employee worked for you in any 20 or more different weeks of the year. You can find the form at www.irs.gov.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adopt workplace safety measures.</strong>
Virtually every employer must comply with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) by, among other things, providing a workplace free of hazards, training employees to do their jobs safely, notifying government administrators about serious workplace accidents, and keeping detailed safety records. For information on these rules, go to website of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at www.osha.gov.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create an employee handbook.</strong>
Although not required, it is an excellent idea to have a handbook describing your business's employee policies and making it clear that employment is at will unless an employee has signed a written employment contract. A great resource is Create Your Own Employee Handbook: A Legal &amp; Practical Guide, by Lisa Guerin and Amy DelPo (Nolo).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set up personnel files.</strong>
For each employee you hire, create a file in which to keep job-related documents, such as job applications, employment offers, IRS Form W-4, performance evaluations, and sign-up forms for employee benefits. Medical records should be kept in a separate, confidential file, in a locked cabinet. And you should store I-9 Forms, which document an employee's immigration status, in a separate file as well. For more information on developing a system for storing and maintaining personnel records, including state-by-state rules about employee access to their files, see The Employer's Legal Handbook, by Fred Steingold (Nolo).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set up employee benefits.</strong>
If your business has established employee benefit programs such as health insurance or a 401(k) plan, you'll need a sign-up procedure so employees can enroll, name their dependents, and select options.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing I would add is, like you said in your question, employee training. This is essential to have a successful employee. With out training (where you would go over the things mentioned above like taxes and policies as well as employee specific stuff like code quality, or expectations) the employee has no idea what is expected of them. Careful training, and followup on that training can make the difference between a successful employee, and a mediocre one.</p>

"Do investors support a startup idea of a full-time working professional?","511","","<p>I have a startup idea and I want to get it up without quitting my current full-time job. Would the investors support it based on just the idea? I really don't want to risk too much by quitting my current job. I am from India. What options do I have? </p>
","<p>Please don't take me wrong, but It's not the Idea that counts but the execution that decides the success or failure!!!..</p>

<p>Everybody will have idea, but only few will dare to execute it and they will be the successful entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>The first quality of the entrepreneur is <strong>BELIEVE IN YOU</strong> and <strong>BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEA!!</strong>. If one doesn't want to take the risk, that means he is not confident about his own idea/venture. Then why will someone else will take the risk?</p>

<p>Look around you. Flipkart, Amazon, IndiaMart, and many more.. All are eCommerce. An Idea. Then why one is popular and big and why other not? Execution, Planning.</p>

<p>There are now so many Bus Ticket Booking applications are there. Then why did the RedBus become so big? Again Execution.</p>

<p>Uber, OlaCabs, mGaadi, TaxiForSure, Meru - All these are Cab Aggregators. Then why Uber/OlaCabs is successful? Yes it is. Planning adn Execution!!!</p>

<p>So, one should make his firm mind to get into his Business Idea completely. Either 0 or 1. There is nothing in-between. </p>

<p>So the next question will be, How should I survive then? What will be the source of income? So there are many answers to it. If you are looking particularly about the investment, one thing that you can think of is, First convince the investor about your idea and say that you'll take a small amount as the Salary in order to take care your life [Definitely it'll be much lesser than your industry standard salary, because in-turn you'll be holding the part/shares of your company/idea]. Most of the investors will understand this and they should be ok with it.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question - with your Full-Time working job, you won't be left with much of time to work on your startup. That means your execution fails miserably, and chances of success will be less.</p>

<p>I've looked and searched all over the net, but didn't find a satisfying answer.</p>
","<p>It also depends upon your choice of database/s and how you decide to write to database/s. My project requires 3 different persistent databases for example, to handle different use cases.</p>

<p>To give an example, I collected tweet streams and wrote them straight into MongoDB.
I had about 1.6 million tweets.
MongoDB was ~ 8.6 GB with long field keys, ~ 5.3 GB with shortened field keys, while Postgres was ~ 780 MB.</p>

I have not touched upon storing pics or videos as that's a very different type of storage than data. You may want to use SSD for database storage while pics can be on cheaper HDDs and much easier and cheaper to scale. Videos can come from youtube via API, and you seem to have  specified ""data storage"" which I take it to mean database storage. You may want to clarify this point.</p>

"Why incorporate in Delaware?","503","","<p>I've heard most tech startups officially incorporate in Delaware. I know facebook incorporated in Delaware, but operated out of California in its early days. </p>

<p>Why has Delaware become a standard state to incorporate in? What are the advantages to incorporating in Delaware versus the state your startup is based in? Do these advantages apply to all startups, or only ones like facebook that are looking for huge growth and investment?</p>
","<p>Well, it seems the answer is pretty obvious, and is exactly what my lawyer told me when we chose to incorporate our s-corp in Delaware: <strong><em>tax and business advantages.</em></strong></p>

<p>I'm personally not a lawyer, but hey, it's SE, and I'm all about references. Learn from <a href=""http://www.bizfilings.com/learn/incorporate-delaware-nevada.aspx"">bizfilings.com</a> here: </p>

<ul>
<li>Delaware’s business law is one of the most flexible in the country.</li>
<li>The Delaware Court of Chancery focuses solely on business law and uses judges instead of juries.</li>
<li>For corporations, there is no state corporate income tax for companies that are formed in Delaware but do not transact business there (but there is a franchise tax).</li>
<li>Taxation requirements are often favorable to companies with complex capitalization structures and/or a large number of authorized shares of stock.
There is no personal income tax for non-residents.</li>
<li>Shareholders, directors and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC don’t need to be Delaware residents.</li>
<li>Stock shares owned by persons outside Delaware are not subject to Delaware taxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, regarding your words about large corporations like Facebook (looking for huge growth or investment) --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"" the court system is not a primary factor when choosing where to form
  a business, but Delaware deserves a special mention. The Delaware
  Court of Chancery is often considered an advantageous venue for
  shareholder lawsuits. It hears only business cases and uses only
  judges, no juries. For large corporations with thousands or hundreds
  of thousands of shareholders, this can be a big plus.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in more or less words, key differentials are <em>absence of state corporate income tax</em> and <em>absence of personal income tax for non-residents</em>, and finally that <em>no investor is required to be a state resident.</em> Those are the biggest advantages that stuck out when it was explained to me. Best of luck!</p>

"Can young people start-up?","495","","<p>I am not yet 18 years old. I have a nice idea, and I think it's revolutionary. I am currently working on the code, as well. Although, for now, I don't see any hurdles in my way, it may still be possible I am not foreseeing something in the future.</p>

<p>What are the problems that young people like me can face for an internet-based venture, and how do we tackle them?</p>

<p>And should I delay my work for the project until I get 18?</p>
","<p>I'm 19 myself. I would definitely not delay if your idea is good enough. ""Good enough"" is definitely not an easy thing to determine, but that's up to you. There are some things to consider about starting a business of any sort, like the time commitment (which can definitely be a range, I don't mean to say running a website is a 24-hour/7-day-a-week job, at least once it's up and running), the actual development, the logistics, and finances.</p>

<p>I've been programming for something like eleven years now, so believe me, I recognize the severity of taking on a full project. I'm even taking a break from school right now to invest my time in a few for clients. It's not a task to be taken lightly. So make sure you're ready to make the time commitment. And remember, however hard it sometimes is to believe, unless your idea is <em>really good</em>, you should make sure you're keeping your grades up throughout the process. Easier said than done, I promise you.</p>

<p>But that's all just logistics and it's up to you how ready you are to take on a serious commitment like starting something. So let's say you are.</p>

<p>Your very first step should be to protect your intellectual property. I've written a number of posts on Startups today that talk about IP, but the gist of it all is that the law doesn't excuse your age: if you have an invention (a process, for instance, used in your app or what have you) that is patentable, then you publicly disclose it without filing the proper applications, your patentability might be adversely affected. You might want to speak with a patent attorney to talk through what IP you might have that should be protected before you go off disclosing it to anyone. Not to mention, if you get your IP settled, there won't be as much of a rush to get things into production. Protection doesn't last forever, but waiting a year is a lot more comfortable when you know nobody will steal the lifeblood of what you hope to release. It won't be cheap to protect, but that brings me to my next point.</p>

<p>Finances are tough for any startup, and I imagine you're no better. It can take a lot of money to maintain a website. The cloud has simplified that and made it significantly cheaper, but that doesn't mean it's free. It all adds up. So if you can, find an adult (a parent, even a teacher or family friend) who believes in you and your idea, and see if they'll invest in you, or even just help you find people who will. There are lots of investors out there who believe in young people's ideas, so if you've got a good one, you have a good chance with them. Even beyond that, you could look into crowd-funding. I bet a heart-felt story about a young developer trying to launch an exciting new product will get at least some money in.</p>

<p>Really, it's all just a matter of trade-offs. Do you think your product will happen with or without you? Do you have the time and resources to put into a project right now, and will you have them as you start coming up on college apps (not that they take much effort, but I'm just trying to express that this isn't a short-term game in most cases)? Are you ready to sacrifice some pleasures of youth for your idea?</p>

<p>That all said, I suppose I'll share my bit of insight from my years of professional development: we're young and we can waste time. If this idea falls through, you'll probably have another later. By starting at such a young age, you can risk something by devoting a lot of time to a project that may or may not work. You can go years with little or no income and you'll still be fine. So be keen to take advantage of that inherent advantage we have. If you can devote a few hours a day, or even just some time on weekends, to working on this, it'll either work out (woo hoo!) or it won't (and you won't have lost anything substantial). You're facing success or experience, and those are both good.</p>

"What are good management and decision making systems for startups in with many founders?","493","","<p>We are a small startup of 5 founders and 14 employees.</p>

<p>Since we are a lot of founders, each founder has to balance between two roles - decision making (high level) and actual work (low level day to day work).</p>

<p>Sometime balancing between the two on the personal level is hard. Also, the decision making process between 5 equal founders is not trivial.</p>

<p>We've defined the fields of responsibility each one has and we've become pretty good at staying out of each other stuff when it's not necessary.</p>

<p>Still, I feel like the traditional hierarchy system is not fit for this type of company (at least until it grows up) and there must be a better way to manage the company. Especially in the field of setting a vector for the company and making a decision that sticks and doesn't get reverted after a while.</p>

<p>I've looked up some other systems like holacracy and flat-organizations.<br>
What decision making processes do you know of that can be a good fit ?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>We've this saying in France, which more or less translates to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot navigate a ship in an iceberg field using committee-driven decision making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same is very true in an organization IMO: some amount of hierarchy, however minuscule, is needed irrespective of wishful thinking.</p>

<p>As such, do things in a committee as much as is reasonable, and play as a team to discuss, negotiate, and schedule doing the right things internally.</p>

<p>But in the end, it must be clear where the responsibilities of each founder begins and ends (their turfs, if you will): if they own it, then it's implicit that they can basically call the shots. And in the hopefully rare moments when it's needed, the CEO's arbitration is final.</p>

<p>If you fail to do so, you'll waste a lot of time on trying to decide what to do, instead of using that precious time to execute.</p>

"Convert a model to SaaS : fixed license to monthly fee ratio?","492","","<p>We are selling software so far per the licence per user around $700, and we are looking to move to a SaaS business model. What is the typical ratio and approach to convert it to a monthly fee ? How much should be this monthly fee / user / month ?</p>
","<p>There's no typical ratio or magical formulas that you can wave a wand and throw pixie dust at.</p>

<p>If your comment to codelion's answer is anything to go by, you're about to do a mistake. Namely, selling essentially the same product at two different prices points because one audience cannot afford $700.</p>

<p>Ignore your current price for a moment, and rethink your offer and its pricing strategy in terms of value.</p>

<p>Summarizing <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1747/1824"">this answer</a> to a slightly related question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Know who you want to target, and identify the upside that you can deliver to each of your segments</li>
<li>Identify the monetary value that corresponds to this upside (e.g. an hour of a $25/hour staff's time saved per week &lt;=> $100/month value <em>per seat</em>)</li>
<li>Structure and price your product based on each segment's needs, upside, and purchasing power</li>
<li>Create tiers based on value-added features and services in addition to raw feature numbers (e.g. auditing would be for enterprise and command too high to disclose prices)</li>
</ol>

<p>I would add two additional remarks in the event your marketing and your sales process currently look like a dog's breakfast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep in mind that people buy benefits, answers, and solutions; not features, processes, prices, or what have you. Clients want a positive ROI, and will buy just about anything at any price if you convince them you'll deliver precisely that. So make all of this upside clear in your marketing right, left and center.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow-up with some regularity once clients sign up. Because as a SaaS, you also want to <em>keep</em> your clients informed of what results they're getting from your software. When it's not clear in their mind (which is far too often), clients end up taking these results for granted ... and listening to competitors who offer new shiny things.</p></li>

"Equity compensation (founding employee) vs. co-founder","487","","<p>I was recently approached by a family member who has a great idea for a subscription-based software product. He is a CTO, well-versed in tech, and has designed and created (through programmers) several great products in the past (internal, or business-to-business software). I am a sr. software engineer and have worked with him to deliver several of the aforementioned products.</p>

<p>Startup costs are negligible. What is necessary is that we both invest considerable time. Because this product is his idea, I have been offered equity compensation. Essentially, I would be a founding employee (not co-founder), and he would maintain controlling interest in the company (he has verbally expressed that he wants to make the business decisions but that I would have input). The highest number that has been thrown around is 20%.</p>

<p>My personal bias and valuation of what I bring to the table makes it difficult for me to look at the offer objectively. Based on the research that I've done, the idea for a product alone doesn't justify controlling interest, assuming that both employee #1 and employee #2 invest time and money equally from day 1. It looks like that's what is being advocated here:</p>

<p>Based on my reading, and this <a href=""http://foundrs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">handy calulator</a> (even assuming a modicum of accuracy, it shows that the 80/20 isn't close), it seems like the offer isn't great.</p>
","<p>Family politics aside, I would politely decline to work with him.  </p>

<p>The fact that he wants to call you a ""founding employee"" and not a ""cofounder"" is a huge red flag.  He doesn't want a partner, he wants an employee that who will do what he is told to do.</p>

<p>He's clearly stated that he will ""make the business decisions.""</p>

<p>He wants 4x the equity that you have.</p>

"How can I reduce the impact of downtime?","477","","<p>As I sit here waiting on downtime to be resolved on one of my most-used services, I started wondering: what kinds of things can a business do to ease the customer service hit of unplanned downtime on a SaaS product?</p>

<p>I'm not too worried about the legal aspects of it, since presumably an SLA is upheld. I'm focusing more on the customer service, and keeping people as happy as possible during the period.</p>

<p><em>Bonus points for addressing planned downtime, but that's not really what I'm going for with this.</em></p>
","<h2>Know that you're down before your users do</h2>

<p>In my experience, the single-most important part of keeping end-users happy is <strong>actually knowing you're down before your end-users do.</strong></p>

<p>It may sound silly and ludicrous. But it's in fact <em>extremely</em> common, not to mention infuriating, for a service provider to become aware that its site or service is down <em>because an end-user told them it was.</em></p>

<h2>Communicate that you know you're down</h2>

<p>Once proper monitoring is in place, how you communicate that you know is basically cosmetic. It can be a status page somewhere (on a different server, of course), it can be updates on twitter, it can be notifications by email or SMS, etc. Matthew has posted a list already. Which medium and the specifics aren't so important.</p>

<p>What really really does matter is communicating to end-users that you already <em>know</em> you're down. You don't want them to inundate you with soul-draining support requests and angry emails and what have you, and you don't want to waste time and resources answering them instead of fixing things.</p>

<h2>Bonus: notify users when you're back up</h2>

<p>In my mind this is mostly a bonus. It can be by email, by SMS, whatever. Make it opt-in (e.g. ""Notify me by email when you're back up!"") or if doing this on Twitter doesn't seem like it's enough.</p>

<h2>Bonus: explain why you were down</h2>

<p>This is also a bonus in my mind. Users care less about why the service was down than about how fast it was back up. If your audience does care about the former, it will usually be satisfied with high level explanations (e.g. ""An excavator slit the telco links while digging a trench."")</p>

<p>If you do this, prefer doing it in a private, clients-only area for the same reason as you wouldn't want prospects to visit a support forum: it can give the wrong impression to potential clients.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, it was a planned downtime...</p>

<h2>Announce your planned downtimes</h2>

<p>For planned downtimes, it's not a bonus. You want to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Explain that you need to be down in advance in a reasonably public place (e.g. the company's blog and Twitter)</li>
<li><strong>Send a reminder to end-users an hour before the downtime if appropriate</strong> (i.e. allow end-users to save their work)</li>
<li>Highlight when the downtime is over in the same reasonably public place.</li>

"Competitively Coding in my Job?","474","","<p>I'm not even sure if this is the right StackExchange forum to post this question in, but I want to see how others will look at this, or if I'm just crazy for making assumptions about the job market.</p>

<p>To give a run down, I am a web developer with knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, Java, CSS, HTML, JSON, SQL, mySQL, jQuery, BASH, linux, numerous APIs, and a little bit of Python. (I also hold 4 Microsoft office certifications, So I know my way around those sorts of things).</p>

<p>When I first began looking for a career as a web developer I put together my own ""template"" website with a bunch of features that companies would be interested in, and even hosted it with my own domain to sort of prettify it. The site could handle sign-ups, forms, payment gateways, full on forms for businesses like bowling alleys to host parties, etc etc. ...After sharing this on Facebook for my friends to see a friends brother, who was creating a business with one of his coworkers, took interest in having me create their website. They were unable to pay me for my services because the business had yet to take off, but they promised a pretty good future position in their company, as well as allowing me to use the website with my name on it for any resumes.</p>

<p><strong>Six months later</strong> I've poured basically all my heart and soul, as well as 99% of my free time, into this website while I attend school and they're making some pretty demanding things out of the website. Still unpaid, They soon want me to sign a contract that they've written themselves that basically just says that anything I make for them is now their property (Which basically removes the ""I can put that I made this on my resume""?), and I'm not being included in any site decisions. (IE: They made the call that they want to make clicking on certain pages taking you to ad.fly before the page, which I call is f***ing stupid and would drive people away). They also asked me to make them a whole new feature (with my skills) that has <em>nothing</em> to do with their company, and they want to <em>split</em> the money out of it (IE; Make us this website that we can sell to other people.)!!!</p>

<p>The other thing that scares me is the other day they told me when they do hire other programmers in the future, when the company takes off, they want to tell the tech team ""Hey, heres an idea, the person who makes it A. The Best, and B. The Fastest, gets the money and the credit, everybody else take a hike."" I am aware that competitive programming is a sport of the aforementioned, but I didn't think it were something in companies, only something that companies would be impressed by and hire somebody for? Typically people in large companies have specified roles like Java Developer, Graphic Designer, and Database Manager. Not; ""Hey you three (JD, GD, DM) compete to make the best Java application!!!""</p>

<p>What should I do??</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: I'm w/ a <em>""company""</em> that wants me to do the work of <em>every programmer on the team</em>, w/ the role of a <em>part time employee</em>, and when they hire people in the future want me to compete w/ them. What do??</strong></p>

"Do Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights transfer between countries?","466","","<p>Do patents, trademarks, and copyrights transfer across borders?</p>

<p>I am starting a web company that will inevitably do business in multiple countries, and I would like to know how best to protect my assets against infringement internationally. Would registering the assets in my home country (Canada in this case) be enough, or should I also look into registering them elsewhere as well?</p>
","<p>The answer is different for each form of intellectual property and the detail is complicated so the best I can do is give an overview.</p>

<p><strong>Copyright</strong>
This is a right that does not need registration in any country that has signed up to the Berne Convention (164 Countries, including Canada, the US and the EU). In the US it is still possible to register copyright and if you do it provides certain advantages (essentially you may be able to claim much higher damages for an infringement that takes place while copyright is registered) but as a general rule copyright is an unregistered right. It arises on creation (or in many jurisdictions ""fixation"" - the recording in permanent form) of the work.</p>

<p>Secondly, Berne countries have agreed to protect the copyright of other jurisdictions at least as well as their own. If you write a program in Canada and someone infringes copyright in that program in the UK you can sue in London for that infringement. There are subtleties such as where does infringement take place on the web and what if you want to sue for damage  that takes place world-wide, but those are too complex to go into here.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that no particular steps are needed.</p>

<p><strong>Trade Marks</strong> Generally when people talk about a ""trade mark"" nowadays they usually mean registered trade marks. </p>

<p>Again there are many subtleties here - for example most common law countries (Canada included) provide a right to sue for what is called ""passing off"" where another business ""passes itself off"" (i.e. appears to be) your business and attracts customers away from your business. That might well include misuse of marks associated with a business which are unregistered. </p>

<p>So, as a general rule, you need to register a trade mark in the jurisdiction that you want to protect it. In the EU it is possible to register what is called a ""Community Trade Mark"" (CTM) which works across the whole EU. This means that, in principle, you might have to pay for more than one registration (eg Canada, US and EU) which is expensive. Worse: trade marks are registered for use classes (this is how Apple the music company and Apple computers managed to co-exist for so long) and the more classes the more cost.</p>

<p>A good trade mark expert ought to be able to advise on the most cost effective way to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Patents</strong> Like trade marks, patents are registered and they are (at the time of writing) restricted to individual countries such as the US, Canada, UK, France or Germany. The EU intends to set up a thing known as a ""unitary patent"" that would be a single patent across most EU countries and, in principle, cheaper and simpler for an EU wide business, but it does not exist yet.</p>

<p>To confuse things more there is a European Patent Office (EPO) that allows you to register a patent for countries in the European Patent Convention - a strictly larger set than the EU. An EPO registration gets you a sort of compromise situation. You have a patent which can be invalidated individually in some countries of the EPC and not others - so strictly speaking it is a bundle of patent rights - but administratively you only have to apply to one office.</p>

<p>In fact there is more international cooperation than this might appear. You can use the registration in one country's office (or the EPO) to start an international process in other countries (though you still have to pay extra for more countries). The result is a little simpler administratively.</p>

<p>Each of those subheadings is a massive simplification I'm afraid, but I hope it gives the general idea.</p>

"Forming a new LLC with no employees","459","","<p>My wife and I have recently formed a LLC for some of the consulting we do in a spare time. We're both fully employed with another company, and the founding members of the LLC with 50 50 percent ownership</p>

<p>In terms of employees, are we employees of the LLC? As in part employees? We have also on one occasion paid 3rd person to do some of the work for us for few hours and we billed our client for it.</p>

<p>I've tried googling but found confusing information regarding this, I was trying to find out, if the LLC currently has 0 employees or the members and occasional contractors are considered employees too?</p>
","<p>You are not an employee unless you have taken the steps required by law for your LLC to legally hire you. The same is also true for contractors. Although, they could be considered a de facto employee if they are working almost exclusively for you. That is a separate question. You might want to do a separate search for contractor vs. employee, if that is a concern.</p>

<p>Back to this question. You can find a summary of the steps toward hiring an employee at <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/content/hire-your-first-employee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sba.gov/content/hire-your-first-employee</a>, but you will want to consult your secretary of state for the details for your particular state.

<p>I'm a US citizen. What would be the best way to report my income overseas so that I pay the least amount of taxes? Any tax loop holes? Do I need to pay taxes if it's under a certain quota? </p>

<p>What if I'm a EU citizen? Does that make a difference when reporting taxes? </p>

<p>A general overview of how taxes work for US citizens working abroad for freelance/opening up an outsourcing startup would be great! </p>
","<p>I have been a freelancer across the EU since 1994 so I hope I can offer some experience/advice.</p>

<p>Firstly, Uncle Sam is one of three countries that tax citizens regardless where they reside in the world. If you live outside the US, you are required by law to fill a special form in, telling Uncle Sam what you earned in where-ever it is that you live (France for example). If your income is above a certain amount ($170,000 I think) then Uncle Sam wants a cut in addition to whatever tax you might have paid France. </p>

<p>If you earn below a a certain amount, the US still expects you to complete the form but tax will not likely become due.</p>

<p>If you curious, the tax the US takes from citizens who live abroad goes towards war veterans who were injured doing their thing abroad.</p>

<p>Think of Nina Simone and Charlie Chapman - both of them got into trouble for living permanently outside the US and Uncle Sam did not forgive them for not contributing to the war funds.</p>

<p>I recommend you watch a documentary called The Corporation (it came out about ten year ago and the first 30-60mins of it will help your thinking, though the entire program is worth watching either way).</p>

<p>I assume you are talking about incorporating a company. If not, you should be. The cost of incorporating varies from $1000 depending on US State and EU Country.</p>

<p>When you incorporate a company, you are creating an entity. This means there are two different taxes that you must consider. One is the Company taxes, and the other are your personal taxes. It is critical that you be clear on this. Because both are liable for different types of taxes. In addition, if the company screws up, then the company, not you personally is held liable.  If a court of law rules that you did not take careful steps to avoid the error, then they can prosecute you personally. A kayaking firms management team in the UK got hit with manslaughter a few year ago because they inadequately supervised a bunch of tourists on the water, two people drowned and the law figured that management made a daft decision. This is important. However... If you create a company, have a good business plan, raise cash from someone and the business goes bust and the company cannot repay the debt then a court of law will review, see it was bad luck and not bad intent, and kiss the debt good bye leaving you able to open another business.  </p>

<p>The UK and Ireland require a minimum of two ""officers"" in a Limited company (minimum Company Secretary and a Managing Director - One person cannot fill both positions). One of them must be resident in the country. Registering is straight forward and cost friendly ($100-$500). </p>

<p>Germany has a ""UG"" status that requires one ""officer"" to create.  Registering in Germany costs about 1000euro.</p>

<p>If you believe your turnover will be more than 70k then you need register for VAT (sales tax). It's free to register.</p>

<p>Then you will need an accountant to submit your tax work. Each situation can vary, for me, it costs me about €1500 a year - I have a good accountant and meet them once or twice a year.</p>

<p>Will your employees be direct employees (meaning you pay their taxes for them) or they will be contractors (they invoice you and they are responsible for their own taxes/pension/health).</p>

<p>Tax loop holes are unfashionable and illegal. There are two terms to be familiar with. Tax efficiency (legal)and Tax avoidance (illegal). The tax man has seen it, sniffed it, touched it, tasted it, moulded, proded and slept with every idea imaginable. I don't recommend you avoid taxes.</p>

<p>Efficiency on the other hand is acceptable. </p>

<p>Corporation tax is in the news alot these days. After your company has paid it's employees, paid its sale taxes, paid all its bills, and then makes a profit... the taxman then takes another slice.  It's called Corporation Tax and it varies from one country to the next.  Some countries have a flat rate corporation tax (the UK has 19%, Ireland has 12%, the US and Germany have a sliding scale, the more your company profits, the higher the Corporation tax).</p>

<p>So, depending on where the company is incorporated can depend on how much the profit is taxed. In order to avoid corporation tax you can award your employees bonus's, or you can invest the money by opening another office in another country or a number of other steps. It's a huge area. Accountants and tax advisors get paid a fortune because they keep an eye on taxs law changed that bring efficiency. There are 'general' laws and then there are cross border agreements (thus the UK might one law when trading with one country, and then a general law for trading with the rest of the world).</p>

<p>Then you have Deleware. When the US talks about closing down tax loopholes in Cayman or Bermuda, they tend to run silent on Delaware which has a boat load of incorporated companies that assist a boat load of companies be efficient in their tax.</p>

"How B2B startup can massively ""cold call"" customers","458","","<p>I'm working for a B2B startup and we have already found our product-market fit and we are planning to get to as many potential customers as possible in next month.</p>

<p>We're wondering what strategy should we use to be maximally effective. We have already gathered a database of industry leaders including emails, LI profiles, etc.</p>

<p>We considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>mass mailing</li>
<li>engaging on Twitter</li>
<li>Google/Facebook ads targeted at those people</li>
</ul>

<p>What else could we do? Please remember this is a B2B product.</p>
","<p>I think the answer to this question highly depends on what you actually try to sell (i.e. how it relates to the different medias, how much it costs, how much customer contact you will have, etc.). But I think even if you say you already have your product-market fit, I would stay in direct contact as long as possible. And in B2B this will maybe even be the whole time.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is a cultural issue, but here in Germany I would recommend doing a real ""cold call"", that is taking the phone and dial their number and try to talk to them directly. For the mass market this is prohibitive in effort, but for B2B, where the costumer value is usually much higher, this is a viable option. (In Lean Statup speak this is equivalent to ""get out of the building"").</p>

<p>There are several direct advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You get <strong>direct feedback</strong>. Even if it is negative feedback, at least you know why someone is not interested. This is much better as with Email, Twitter or Ads where your only negative response is no response at all, and it is left to you to figure out what went wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>circumvent the ""call to action""</strong>. Even if someone finds your Email, Tweet or Ad remotely interesting, getting them to actually act on it (i.e. only click on the ad) is a tough task. This is why you have such a high drop-out rate in the funnel of customer conversion. When you call them directly, they can stay much more passive and still become your costumer.</p></li>
<li><p>You get <strong>additional feedback</strong>. You don't only get the results as in ""someone decided to click through to the end"" but you can ask questions (which you should do) as in <strong><em>why</em></strong> did they like your product. What terms in your message did they respond to? What key features triggered their interest?</p></li>
<li><p>You collect valuable experience in <strong>talking to customers</strong>. Depending on your product or service, but especially in B2B, many clients (at least in Germany) expect some direct contact - which you now can train on making.</p></li>
<li><p>You can constantly <strong>improve your campaign</strong>. With most ads/emails/tweets you get a single shot. And if it fails, your will start to irritate possible future customers as you try to pressure on (and get on their nerves e.g. with email). With direct contact you can adjust per person and improve throughout the campaign as you climb the learning curve.</p></li>

","<blockquote>

<p>Citation needed - checking for lack thereof is what a patent attorney is for among other things.</p>

<p>The truth is, you probably don't. Plus as already highlighted by FKEinternet ideas can't be patented - only implementations can, and in some cases concepts if you can provide more than one implementation in the application.</p>

<p>No really... There almost certainly are inventors (and trolls) out there who have already patented parts or all of the concepts underlying your idea. Your odds of having an idea that is genuinely novel and isn't covered by another patent on some vaguely related topic are slim at best.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am wondering if I should go through the time and money it takes to actually get it patented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have $5k+ around that you can waste as play money, then a patent might be an option. $10-25k for a patent certainly isn't unheard of in the US. Patents  attorneys there routinely charge $500/hour. It's somewhat cheaper in Europe but barely so. And just about nobody cares about patents filed elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't have an excess amount of money</p>

<p>Then a patent probably shouldn't be an option until you've a proven market. Which brings us to...</p>

<p>Why in the world would you patent an idea that does <em>not</em> have a proven market?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not sure whether it is necessary or not</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three words: it's not.</p>

<p>Ok, look... Would-be investors (especially the ones that appear on TV) would have you believe that you really really want a patent before chasing their money. But that's BS. What they're actually telling you is that if you want their $$$ to test your market then you should take the risk of protecting your would-be IP before they're comfortable giving you a dime. And let's be honest, they're right, <em>because anything short is taking a huge risk</em>.</p>

<p>The reality is closer to this: they will drool and hump and beg to invest in your business if you only need them to go faster. Put another way, if you show up with a proven market, patent or not, they <em>will</em> fund you - with a much better term sheet at that - <em>because there's very little risk</em>.</p>

<p>Ergo, save the $XYZ you'd have wasted on a patent, and use it instead to go chase customers.</p>

"What is the North star of a company that sells hardware products?","448","","<p>In the <a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec06/"" rel=""nofollow"">lecture about Growth</a> of the YC Startup Class, Alex Schultz says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need someone to set a North star for you about where the company wants to go<br>
  [...]<br>
  So for operating for growth, what you really need to think about, is <strong>what is the North star of your company</strong>: What is that one metric, where if everyone in your company is thinking about it and driving their product towards that metric and their actions towards moving that metric up, you know in the long-run your company will be successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also gives a number of example North stars of companies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You'd see you <em>registered user</em> numbers for MySpace, [...]<br>
    Mark [Zuckerberg (Facebook)] put out <em>monthly active users</em>, [...]<br>
    If you’re a messaging application, <em>sends</em> is probably the single most important number. [...]<br>
    Inside Airbnb, they talk about <em>‘nights booked’</em> [...]<br>
    For eBay, it was <em>gross merchandise volume</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citations from the <a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec06/"" rel=""nofollow"">transcript</a>, emphasis added by me.</p>

<p>As the whole class is primarily about software startups, these examples are also in this field. But what would be a great North star for a company selling hardware products?</p>

<p>Of course, the <em>number of sold units per time interval</em> suggests itself, but is it actually a good metric? Compared to social networks this is more like a counterpart to <em>registered users</em> and less like <em>monthly active users</em> and thus ignores everything except the fact that the device was sold. So this may be too simple.</p>

<p>Looking at Apple for example, besides the number of sold devices, they also talk about <em>customer satisfaction rates</em>. This addresses the time after the purchase, but is not sufficient to measure growth.</p>

<p>Thus the question: <strong>What would be a great North star for a company selling hardware products?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>As different types of companies obviously have different North stars, I am particularly interested in the case where a single customer will usually not buy more than one unit over a few years (maybe skateboards or in-line skates or things where the buying pattern is similar).</p>
","<p>The idiom North Star as you know, means having a key metric that everyone knows and actively plots towards. That said, unlikely the real North Star, over the growth of a startup, this will change in my opinion.</p>

<p>Core issue with your question is that in the end, in my opinion, that this metric more often than not is also the unique value proposition of the company at a given point in time.  </p>

<p>As such, there is no single North Star for any startup of a given type, it's something they've got to find one their own.</p>

"Splitting equity between founders","445","","<p>So I have an idea for a product that I've been working on for about a year. The product includes mobile app (iOS/Android) and server (front and back end). I am not a developer so I was mainly doing product modeling and definitions. </p>

<p>Now I (as a CEO) would like to get a few more people on board. One of them (A) will actually be architecting, developing and later managing our development efforts (CTO/VP RnD or something like that). The other one (B) will develop stuff and report to A.</p>

<p>How should we split equity in this case? I would like to remain in control of all the business and strategy aspects.</p>
","<p>I recommend you take a look at this tool: <a href=""http://foundrs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://foundrs.com/</a></p>

<p>It gives you a rough estimate what would be considered a standard equity sharing. Of course in the end it comes from how much you're willing to give away and your negotiations with your fellow team members. Bear in mind the saying ""1% of something is more than 100% of nothing"" so you need to give your co-founders enough to motivate them to build something great and not just walk away when they get a job offer with a nice salary.</p>

<p>All those details however depend a lot on who you're getting involved and where you'relocated, so you have some math and calculation tables ahead of you :)</p>

<p>Based on what I mostly assumed from your given input, i got something in the following range:</p>

<p>You: 44%; CTO: 36%; Dev: 20%</p>

<p>This was my input, but you have a go as you have the most knowledge of your situation. Also business is mostly about selling and negotiations, if you can sell your case strongly to the co-founders, you may have a upper-hand in negotiations.</p>

"what is the role of investors in an IT company business?","442","","<p>I am learning how to startup an IT company. I'd like to know what is the role of investors in a company? I don't have any contacts or such guys who can help me for these. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>This is a really open ended question, but I will do my best to answer.</p>

<p>In short, investors give you money in exchange for a share in your company. In other words, they give the company money, and the company give them some amount of say in what the company does.</p>

<p>Some investors will give you advice on what you should do, and others will not. Try to look for investors that will actually be interested in the company and giving your company good advice and avoid <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O&#39;Leary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the ones that just want the money</a>.</p>

<p>What they are looking to do is for your company to grow so that they can take a portion of the profits or sell the shares for more money in the future.</p>

<p>Also, check out the answers to <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1329/how-does-multiple5-investor-fundraising-process-work/"">this question</a>; I think they might give you a more broad idea.</p>

<p>What I mean with <em>signup via invitation</em> is that users can't create an account in the application unless another <strong>registered user</strong> sends them an invitation for join to the web application (or maybe them could create an account BUT they wouldn't have privileges in some actions -Dribbble is an example of this).</p>
","<p>Your question is legit. 
There is two different mechanisms going on here that you would like to fully understand.</p>

<p>On one side we create an inner circle of exclusivity. 
This is gamification at its early shape. It works in both way, users that are already inside the circle become ambassadors, users that are not inside the platform yet generate buzz in order to get in.</p>

<p>On the other side we have a basic traction/action situation. 
Who is inside the inner circle already? Why is being inside so important?  This is what you need to figure it out.</p>

<p>If you can answer yes to at least one of the following questions, you may want to consider the invitation system as registration booster strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you offering a service for free to registered user that they can not get for free otherwise?</li>
<li>Are the people using already the application opinion leaders? If yes, is their propagation ratio > 20?  (it means, can they lead more than 20 people to sign up?)</li>
<li>Do you have any other source of traction? i.e. 3rd party reviews or press? </li>

"How Startups 'Prove' Number of Users?","434","","<p>I researched a while to get an answer for this question, but didn't find one.</p>

<p>When a mobile app startup approaches investors, usually tries to show the number of users on their pitch material. The question is, how does a startup actually prove that they have that number of users?</p>

<p>Say, I reach an investor and claim that my mobile app has 10,000 registered users. Is he/she going to ask me to provide a list of users perhaps with their email addresses? If not, I could claim a very high number that attracts them on the spot (I wouldn't do that of course, but I'm really curious).</p>

<p>And finally, a lot of users might have provided fake email addresses. Do we have to force them to verify their email addresses (using an activation link)?</p>

<p>Any ideas are appreciated.</p>
","<p>It's a very interesting topic to define what user is to a startup.
When it comes to a mobile app, usually number of downloads and number of registrations are key factors. Number of downloads describes the reach of the app and number of registered users defines user engagement. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should the registration involve email verification ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it depends on what you want to do. A lot of apps do that but you could also use phone number verification which is usually faster, if at all phone is mandatory, by sending code via sms and user enters it to verify the phone numbers. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fake users ? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it doesn't matter as long as the app is downloaded and you have verified users. In the mobile world there's no concept of fake users IMHO as its a downloadable app. </p>

<p>An investor would certainly ask about the users db and their activity over a given period to understand how your so called users are using the app. </p>

<p>How can one select an idea or assess the market's needs without much investment (as I am just a college student)?</p>
","<p>Cheapest method - depends on the audience. If it is a mass market product, then use the Mechanical Turk. Put up ads saying you want to talk to people about their recent experience of (whatever it is you solve). Then ask them behavioural questions (why did you look to solve this problem, how often have you tried to solve this problem, what does it cost you to get this problem solved, etc). Don't ask forward facing questions - they're misleading (i.e. don't ask whether they will buy it, how much they'd be prepared to pay, or any other speculation about they might behave in a future context). </p>

<p>If it is a specialised product, then find the people most likely to be buying, and ask them, over the phone. Same thing - historical questions.</p>

"What equity can I expect as a first employee of a startup?","433","","<p>So, I graduated from college about 6 months back and have been working in a pretty big company (in fact the leading ecommerce company in my country) for about 4 months. The work is not very challenging or interesting right now but the team is very good and the environment is pretty relaxed. I am not dissatisfied with my job.</p>

<p>Two of my batchmates who had been working on an idea for about a year and half recently managed to raise seed funding of about $100,000 at a valuation of $1 million or so I am told.</p>

<p>Because of the time they have put into the startup they don't have a degree yet and don't seem like getting one in near future but do seem dedicated towards the startup.</p>

<p>Anyways they are offering me 2% equity and the same salary as my current job and the position of CTO (Personally with me being the only tech guy at the moment I'm not sure if the title means much). The offer at the moment is up for negotiation.</p>

<p>Currently one of the cofounders is working as the sole tech guy but if and when I join the company, I'll have that responsibility with the cofounders busy in raising the next round.</p>

<p>Considering what's at stake here, with me leaving my first company less than a year and the only guy with a degree (whose significance may vary from person to person) I'm not sure I'm getting a fair enough deal.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely comfortable working under my batchmates as just an employee. If I'm leaving such a comfortable position, it doesn't make sense for me to join a company just as an employee. I would like to help run the startup as well. But who apart from cofounders can run the startup? At the same time they have been at it for almost two years and managed to raise funding on their own. So, it doesn't make sense to ask to be made a cofounder, if that's even a possibility. Or is this request actually fair?</p>

<p>So, what are my options here? Increasing equity probably makes sense? If so, how much equity can I expect?</p>

<p>Is there any other way where I can stop being just an employee? Is it fair to be ask to be made a cofounder? Do I have any other options?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit:
I read up a few answers on equity distribution and a lot of them focus on the risk factor. I think it is arguable to say that I am taking a big risk leaving my job less than 6 months (which might reflect poorly on my resume) as compared to the founders themselves who have not got much to lose. They can always continue with their education in case of the worst scenario. Of course this is opinion based and hence I have used the word arguable.</p>
","<p>Do you bring anything to the company that nobody else can? Unless that is the case, I don't think it is a terrible offer.</p>

<p>Thinking about risk: you will get the same salary as now (And a 2% share = 20'000 USD on top) - which is not a typical start-up risk. A real risk in a start-up is that you would get no salary at all and then it would also make sense that you get a bigger share. (I currently work for free for my own start-up ...)</p>

<p>Wondering what equity you would consider fair? Think about this: if you would get 20% share that would mean that you would get 200'000 USD for free - quite a lot for explaining future employers that you left a job after 6 months for a cool start-up job you have been offered.</p>

<p>It's tough for employee number one, because it's too early for you to be able to offer the kind of development that you will be able to in a few years.

","<p>Having worked in a large bookstore a bit over a decade ago back when eBooks were on everyone's radar but not quite there yet, a few ideas on how to sell a book:</p>

<li>If it's a physical book, organize reading and signing events with the author at bookstores, specialized trade shows, etc. In the case of a comic eBook, think custom picture signing events. You hopefully get the point: get authors to meet with readers.</li>
<li>Have the author build an audience by blogging and guest-blogging: story and character background, ""the making of"" posts, bonus pictures, you name it. Ensure the audience finds this blog (see 1).</li>
<li>Ensure the book itself has a proper landing page with some samples and so forth.</li>
<li>Start promoting the book <em>before</em> it's finalized and published (points 1 and 3). Create a mailing list, and get potential readers to sign up and eagerly await the book's release.</li>
<li>2015-edition: organize a <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/comics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kickstarter</a> to ""finish and print the book"". Use the mailing list to feed the initial batch of backers and pre-sell the book.</li>

<p>Publishers have been mostly penniless in recent years because they got squeezed out of their margins by Amazon. As such, they usually stick to doing point 1 and hygienic amounts of 2.</p>

<p>I would figure that I can make transfers (since the business bank account and my bank account are sort of linked) and record every transfer.  But when thinking about taxes, what does that mean for me or my company?</p>

  <p>The IRS by default considers a single-member LLC as a “disregarded entity” for tax purposes and treats it as a sole proprietorship.</p>

<p>I figure paying myself does not affect the bottom line of the business income, but does the business have to file a form for me with the amount given?  Do I have to file personal taxes showing that the business paid me?</p>

<p>Any help (in small words) would be greatly appreciated!

","<p>LLC provides some protection of your personal assets from the liabilities of the company. From the IRS perspective, though, all company income is yours immediately no matter what account it may be in, and all expenses are personally yours as well.</p>

<p>In other words, the limited liability company provides limited protection from creditors, customers, contractors and other organizations, but nothing... absolutely... nothing... protects you from the IRS.</p>

<p>For tax purposes you will report your income and expenses on a Schedule C just as if there was no LLC.</p>

<p>The only difference would be if you had a partner, but it sounds like you are a single member LLC. I can update the answer if that is not the case.</p>

"Startup proposal from Software Engineers","422","","<p>I have been talking to a team of 4 from India about developing a startup. We have initial startup money of $40K. Today they sent a proposal on how long it would take them to build the application. They believe that it will take them 84 Days to build the application with a team of 4 at $25 an hour each ($67,000 in total).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L20DJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L20DJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I want to know some bargaining ways to potentially talk them down on their initial proposal. Whether that it is their price per hour, days spent on certain features, etc. </p>

<p>Anyone that has had previous experience with working out the cost for the developers would be great for this question. If worst comes to worst we can take out an additional loan to cover the rest of the costs, but I would prefer not to.</p>
","<p>There are few way to negotiate the price.</p>

<p>1- understand what they are re-using and what needs to be implemented opportunistically for your application. I.e. social login is usually a pretty common component of every app.</p>

<p>2- break down the most time consuming tasks. This gives you visibility on what is the most impacting subtask. Usually is also harder for the service provider to justified prices/time when it comes to really simple tasks.</p>

<p>3- having a fixed price, no metter what task they are doing, is unreasonable. A server side engineer shouldn't earn the same as a UX researcher. Ask them to give for each task the cost/h based on the skill of the person involved.</p>

<p>4- the usability evaluation listed that late in the project make me doubt about the quality and the impact of the task. Beside this, you should be the one validating the usability throughout the entire process.</p>

<p>5- final delivery sounds a bit suspicious, again ask to break down into smaller tasks. </p>

<p>Now, besides all those points, you need to understand they are a business, so their offer is based also on the market offer. Having different competitors' offers allow you to negotiate better.
Back in time, it was a common practice to take offer A, lower by 20%, go to vendor B, ask for a quote after showing the adjusted offer from vendor A, get a new offer from vendor B (that usually is around 22-25% less than the real vendor A's initial offer) and then go back to vendor A. Please note I will not discuss the ethical side of such behavior.</p>

"Considering new Partner, how to structure financial contribution?","420","","<p>First, some background...</p>

<p>I've got a new startup, with a product that's about 1 month away from MVP.  It's a SaaS product and we've already got a couple pilot customers ready and waiting, who will paying setup and monthly fees.  Having said that, I think it's fair to say that the concept is tested and has a fairly high probability for success.</p>

<p>There are 3 total partners right now, and one of them is funding most everything.  His risk is pretty low in doing this because he also owns a company that will be a customer.  Worst case scenario, he paid for a sweet product that his company can use - not much different than outsourcing the project and keeping it to himself.</p>

<p>We're considering bringing on a 4th partner who will help develop another area of the business and also help with sales and identifying product features.  The 3 existing partners would kick in equal amounts of equity to bring him on.  There would be no salary for this new partner until we start to make money, which he's fine with due to a nice nest egg.</p>

<p>Now the question... Is it fair to ask for a capital contribution as well?  If so, how much?  I have no idea what the company is worth right now, but about $100K has been spent so far.  The person funding the project now is doing so as debt, so eventually he will get paid back.  If we ask for a contribution, should that also be debt or would it be fair to expect that to go straight to the business?</p>

<p>This is new territory for me and I appreciate any help.</p>
","<p>I see three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it fair to ask for capital contribution - That would depend on whether you need the capital and whether he can afford it. If the debt financing partner is happy to continue funding then there is no need to bring in additional capital. It would also keep the books cleaner and there would be less debtors. </p></li>
<li><p>If so how much? That would depend on your short term capital requirements. If you need funding to ramp up your sales and marketing activities then create a budget and determine how much of that budget can be funded by your current capital and if there is a deficit, how much of the deficit your existing partner is willing to finance. If there is a gap after that, then that is your additional funding requirement that you can potentially ask from this new partner. </p></li>
<li><p>Should the new funding be debt or for equity? - His contribution can be as a debt, equity or as gift. If it is debt he gets paid back, if it is equity then he buys shares in the company and he owns a proportional percent of the company (if company is valued at 1m and he paid 100k then he owns 10% and a claim to future profits and if company goes under, a claim to the assets). If it is a gift then he gets love, goodwill, and maybe the best parking space in the lot. Going for equity would involve getting the company valued and assessing the ownership stake of each of the partners and then determining the dilution of existing shares as the new shares are issued. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you have been getting your ownership stake for contributing elbow grease(2 partners) or loans (1 partner), then he would find it fair to expect the same: free shares for effort or for a loan. If you don't need an additional funding sources then you either give him shares for effort or create a new precedent stating that since you don't need further funding and since the other 2 partners have already done 90% of the work, new partners are now required to buy in. The problem is that the new partner can see the exception and walk away or he may not be able to afford the buy in. So it breaks down to how badly you want him and whether he is able to afford the buy in. If he is willing and able, then it is all good. </p>

"Is there a limit to how long you can accumulate startup costs?","416","","<p>I'm researching the construction of some particular computer hardware, but I expect it to be several years (let's say 5) before I may, if at all, complete it. I'd like to be able to write off my research related costs, but I feel like this is something I could only do after successfully selling said hardware. I'm fairly certain the IRS would <em>view this as a hobby</em> until the research is complete.</p>

<p>Maybe not the first year, but given the length of expected research time, as well as the possibility of failure, there's no way I would meet the ""profitable 3 out of 5 years"" rule. Not to mention, my background is much more related to software than hardware, which can also be used to prove that this is a ""hobby"" rather than a legitimate business venture.</p>

<p>An alternative seems to be to continue to accumulate the research costs, then after the 5 years, actually open the business and amortize the cost over 15 years, as a startup cost. But that leaves me wondering, is there a limit to how long you can accumulate start up costs for? I was reading some of the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch08.html#en_US_2014_publink1000208938"">IRS publications</a> on it, but I don't see any mention of a time limit.</p>

<p>Is there any risk of me structuring this in this way?</p>
","<p>Well, unless you start a company now, ""invest"" your expenses in the company (e.g. you invest your work and money), and then write them off, I don't see how this would work - IRS has no way of telling if you are actually doing a research? What for? </p>

<p>I could, for example, claim that I purchased a bunch of tools and materials to explore possibility of me opening a woodworking business, but that wouldn't go very far, would it?</p>

<p>Intent of the start-up costs is to amortize expenses directly related to purchase or incorporation of a business - legal fees, consulting, etc. etc. Simply put, they are intended to amortize the cost of a business you are already ""starting"", not the costs you will spend in your lifetime to rinse out the idea you have for the business. However, I might be a little wrong on this, as a skilled accountant can actually turn miracles into wine.</p>

<p>As to your background, it does not really matter - if you have sufficient knowledge to actually do the research you are to do and with express business intent, it should suffice.</p>

<p>To the start-up costs, the document you linked already explicitly states, that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start-up costs do not include deductible interest, taxes, or <strong>research and experimental costs</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>You can elect to amortize your research and experimental costs, <strong>deduct them as current business expenses</strong>, or write them off over a 10-year period (see Optional write-off method below).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies you already have a business, explicitly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you elect to amortize these costs, deduct them in equal amounts over 60 months or more. The amortization period begins the month you first receive an economic benefit from the costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, see <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS publication 535 (2014), Business Expenses Chapter 7 - Costs You Can Deduct or Capitalize</a>.</p>

<p>However, I say this from whatever limited experience with US tax legislation I have. You should really, and I mean, really consult with accountant that is familiar with federal and state taxation laws and regulations of where you reside. </p>

"Equity vs Salary - Options","412","","<p>I'm considering an opportunity as a developer with an early stage Real-time chat startup with focus on language translation (pre-series A, market value of 5.2m, 4 employees, I'd be the 2nd developer) with:</p>

<ul>
<li>a solid MVP platform (a product I strongly believe, after the demo, could be quite valuable)</li>
<li>technology I'm comfortable with</li>
<li>a product I saw today and believe could be quite valuable</li>

<li>highest salary, .4% options (15,000 options valued at $21,717 today)</li>
<li>$10k less than highest salary, .56% equity (20,250 options valued at $29,318 today)</li>
<li>$20k less than highest salary, .89% equity (32,000 options valued at $46,329 today)</li>

<p>I currently have a stable job and would need to relocate for this (from NYC to Boulder, CO), but I'm interested in their product as mentioned. The $20k less than highest salary is about on par with what I make now, so I wouldn't be losing much (Boulder is a 8% less cost of living than NYC), but am unsure of whether to go all in on equity. </p>

<p><strong>My questions in detail are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When we do exit (IPO or get bought out), I have the option to exercise my shares for the purchased price. This means I'd have to pay ~$40k to then cash out for a higher value. So the $ I'd receive is the share price at startup sale - my initial purchase price, right? </li>
<li>I'm aware of the statistic that 90% of startups fail. Yet, taking the highest salary is sort of betting against myself if I join. Moreover, it looks better to the company if I go for equity. Is it generally better to go in on higher salary? As the 2nd full time dev, I'd expect to be responsible for 30-40% of the dev work. Therefore, I want to make sure I'm paid.</li>
<li>We have a number of previous investors (some Angel), and the CEO has 30% share in the company- While he told me the board is aligned with his vision, he doesn't have controlling share. Meaning, the investors may be able to set unrealistic milestones. Should this worry me?</li>

I'm building the web apps with AngularJS, vanilla JS &amp; some jQuery. I'm technically only a ""junior"" web developer so my salary is basic (roughly average for a typical front-end dev just coding ""flat"" sites.) Anyway, that explained, I have to work very hard and I'm happy to do so because I'm gaining experience rapidly, learning tonnes and constantly pushed to keep learning which I think is the key to good programming--so I'm fairly happy with the situation. </p>

<p>After a probation period I'm due to get some equity in the company. I was told recently that this will be &lt;0.1% which with a current valuation of &lt; $5M isn't a great deal, and I'm slightly dismayed by it. It's easy to see a massive stock price would need to develop over time to gain any amount handsome enough to start my own ventures with. It's a really good idea and I do believe in it, but let's face it, not many startups go $1B+. It's clear the contribution I need to make to the overall success of the project is certainly significant (to say the least, it'll involve both a business side app to be used by all the implementers and a consumer facing one which is expected to garner a <em>lot</em> of attention.)</p>

<p>So what I'm trying to get is some perspective from those who have experience with this--this is practically my first job, let alone startup environment, and I want to try to gather some realistic expectations and be sure I'm not being unreasonable. I have two questions, really: <strong>does this seem like a reasonable amount of equity given the numbers provided and my responsibilities? Any tips for how to approach negotiations or what I ought to expect realistically?</strong></p>

<p>Any advice or especially experience appreciated. Thank you.</p>
","<p>If you're amongst the first batch of employees (say, 1-10), then .1% is low by SV standards. If you're amongst the next set (say 11-100), it's common.</p>

<p>The devils are in the details, though. Parts of it depend on how rich the company is, parts of it depend on your salary negotiation skills, parts of it depend how you approach these negotiation to begin with, and so forth. There's no one size fits all.</p>

<p>A few pointers, though:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As a non-founder, prefer salary over stock. Don't kid yourself here.</p>

<p>And never accept a tiny bit more stock in exchange for a lower salary.</p>

<p>Because, if you hang around and the company fails in five years, the founder's downside is to have worked for an undervalued founder salary. Your downside, if you accepted stock in exchange for a lower salary, is to have worked for an undervalued employee salary for the same number of years.</p>

<p>If the company turns into a big success, in contrast, the founder's upside is a giant wad of cash. Your upside is a mere bonus in comparison. And it's not necessarily a big one at that, since it's typically vested options at arbitrary valuation levels.</p>

<p>Very similar downsides; very different upsides.</p>

<p>Therefor, as a non-founder, stock should only have upside. Equity is a bonus, and this should be on your radar at all times while negotiating.</p></li>
<li><p>If your startup gets in the way of you having a life, meaning long hours, crunch time code marathons, and what have you, make sure you get appropriately compensated for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that a start-up's tech staff frequently consists in undervalued enablers, and that you're in a seller's market.</p>

<p>Put bluntly, you're holding the hand full of Aces here; the person in front of you is just good at bluffing. And he needs you a lot more than you need him.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that you're not getting compensated for your time or for your work if you feel like there's an entrepreneur inside you.</p>

<p>You're getting compensated for the opportunity cost of not working on your own projects.</p>

<p>How much do you think you'd make working on them? With very conservative assumptions, how high are your chances of success? Adjust for the savings you'll burn through until you become profitable or locate investors. Your salary, plus risk-adjusted stock-related bonus, should ideally be in the same ballpark.</p>

<p>Because if it's not, it means you trust your ability to make more while doing your own things.</p></li>

Clearly we never increased the equity we gave her, but we had to convince her that her equity had nothing to do with her value to the company, but that it was just a measurement of risk, that some of us had taken far more risk than others (I had barely scraped through my senior year of college, amassing 6-figure loans, and turned down an offer at Google - my business partner dropped out entirely).</p>

<p>But, come to think of it, was I <em>misleading her?</em> Clearly she had not contributed as much, but should I have tried to relate that she was not as valuable as she had somehow thought?</p>

<p>She's clearly a person, and we think she's great. She just has been working jobs and living comfortably while the rest of us eat ramen :) and I'm unsure of how I handled this situation.</p>
","<p>I'd say, and obviously this question is inherently opinion-based (although as @connor has suggested, not in a bad way), that you were right to describe the share of equity as being a description of accumulated risk.</p>

<p>It's kind of--well, more than kind of--like pay: the eternal question is what's fair between paying your employees and paying yourself. Obviously this has all had a pretty negative connotation associated with it, and I don't mean to make this political, but realistically the 99% movement of a couple years ago is just evidence that you're far from alone in making the call that someone who's involved in a less--I'm struggling to phrase this to sound as I want it to so bear with me--pertinent way, should receive less of the company and its profits than someone in management.</p>

<p>Without sounding too condescending to the lifeblood of our corporate world, the fact is, compensation is a way to keep people around. <strong>It isn't a gift that polite managers give out to employees.</strong> You pay someone because you believe they are benefiting you more than the money independently would. Obviously some employers are more generous than others, and I certainly have no issue with that whatsoever. But that's the idea. It's compensation for coming into work and getting what you need to done, and it's an assurance that no other companies will steal your employees to join their own workforce. If your competitors were sending her better offers, then she would have a good bargaining chip to get more from you, but as it stands, that's what the industry seems to consider her worth.</p>

<p>Three percent is a pretty big portion of a company to give to someone, as you said. By giving her three percent, you're effectively telling her that she brings to the table more than that three percent would otherwise invested. That's a pretty big deal. For someone who's only been around for six months of a lifecycle worthy of dropping out of school for, I'm impressed that your company considered her worthy of that.</p>

<p>So how, then, can we measure how much someone brings to the table? I think, as I started off saying, you're right to assess it based on risk. The fact is, presumably, if you hadn't scraped by your senior year of college, the company wouldn't be around today. Thus, it follows pretty logically that you've brought more to the company than someone who recently joined on.</p>

<p>To a point, it doesn't matter how valuable she is now, because you clearly managed up until six months ago without her. And furthermore, I'd make the guess that if she hadn't applied or you hadn't recruited her, you'd be saying this all about someone else. On the other hand, if you were originally uninterested in the business, it might not even have started in the first place. It's her job now to earn her wage as time progresses, and as she receives the bonuses and pay (each of which might include equity in the company) that she seems to think her worth is worthy of, she'll begin to increase her power in the company. That's how businesses are meant to work.</p>

<p>So, all in all, yes, I think you were misleading her a bit. Speaking in extremes, if she felt she deserved 50% of the company, then that would be completely frivolous because she just hasn't put in enough to earn that. She probably <em>isn't</em> as valuable as she thinks she is. <em>But</em>, from a managerial perspective, I think you were right to describe that value in terms of risk. I don't think you were wrong to mislead her. Realistically, her believing that her presence is extremely important is good for you all, so long as she doesn't try for more than she deserves as a result, and if she does, you can deal with that then. But for now, I think you were best to just leave it as a matter of risk assumption. Explaining the whole capitalistic system to someone who overvalues herself isn't going to be productive, and it will just hurt feelings unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Yes. A limited company can exist with no expenses at all.</p>

<p>Yes. Either register with the taxman to begin paying salary using PAYE, or pay without tax deducted and declare it on your self-assessment form at the end of the tax year.</p>

<p>Yes. You need to make sure that it's taxed appropriately, that's the only real issue. </p>

<p>If you're the sole owner of the limited company then it may be more tax-efficient to take money out in dividends rather than salary, but there are some restrictions on this: see <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/ir35-find-out-if-it-applies"" rel=""nofollow"">the 'IR35' info on the HMRC website</a> or consult a tax advisor.</p>

I live in Canada but I have my green card and am eligible to live in the US at any time. I plan on moving to the US within the next few months so I plan on registering the company as a US company. I plan on moving to New Jersey. With that said, at what point do I have to register my company / company name? Is it okay if I launch and advertise the app / website without registering the company and name first? (I'm asking because I am too busy to go all the way to NJ right now just to register the name and business). Or is the company and name registration mandatory before I launch and advertise the app and start getting users? </p>

","<p>Yep! Trademarks, like copyrights, are granted immediately. The rule for an implicit trademark is that it must be used in commerce, but releasing your app would satisfy that.</p>

<p>Of course, with trademarks, you can get extra damages if you sue and you put the whole country on notice of your use of the mark, which grants you the right to use the name anywhere in the nation, and is useful for cases like this, where your app will likely be used by people everywhere. So there're advantages in doing it early, but you can definitely go and register it after you've been using it for as long as you want.</p>

<p>Business name registration is the same way, you can wait as long as you'd like.</p>

<p>The only hesitation is that you, first off, want to make sure you get the protection before anyone else tries to. You'd have the upper-hand and would likely win any suits, but that's always more expensive than if you had the proper paperwork filed in the first place. And, of course, in registering a business, you're relieving yourself of a lot of liabilities, which might not be a bad idea early-on but that's out of the scope of this question.</p>

"Hiring remote developer from Russia","389","","<p>What are legal issues when hiring developer located in Russia? Our company is based in the USA .</p>

<p>Is it better to hire this person as an independent contractor instead of as an employee?</p>

<p>Is having a US based employee easier than a remote foreigner? More expensive from paperwork side at least I think. In this case we will most likely hire the Russian developer temporary while searching for a local developer.</p>

<p>(Our services are based on a software framework well known in ex-USSR states and not in other parts of world).</p>
","<p>TL;DR: Hire your offshore developer as a contractor. Companies do this all the time. It will be cheaper and easier than setting up shop in Russia just for that purpose. But:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay on excellent terms with your offshore developer because you do NOT want to fight in court and see labor laws catch up with you. Provision accordingly if you end up doing so.</li>
<li>Make sure they're doing everything by the book. Even if it means you telling them to get a local accountant at your expense.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>International employment is a somewhat murky business. At a high level, there are two ways to hire someone in developed countries:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can hire that person as an employee using any of the one or more available types of contracts (some countries have more than one).</p></li>
<li><p>You can hire that person as a contractor, which is to say you outsource some work to a separate company.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hiring someone as an employee involves administrative paperwork in the employee's country. This is regardless of the country you're based in. As the employer, you'll become responsible for paying part or all of that employee's social security and retirement benefits, PAYE (Pay As You Earn) if applicable, and so forth. In most cases, you'll incorporate a subsidiary in said country if you're not based there already in order to get the requisite tax IDs and what have you, and then hire someone or a company to dot 'i's, cross 't's, and take care of the gritty details.</p>

<p>Again, I insist: as a US business, hiring a Russian employee based in Russia would involve you will dealing with the Russian administration.</p>

<p>For completeness I'll mention the slight twist to the above scenario where you hire a local employee and dispatch the latter to another country. Theoretically, you could see to it that your Russian developer gets a US work permit, hire that person as a US employee, and dispatch them back to Russia. It's similar to the above with a twist: you'd pay into US social security, retirement benefits, and what have you. They'd be responsible for declaring their net revenue in Russia in addition to their US-based paperwork. And don't get me started on the inanities related to getting a foreign doctor's invoice refunded - it usually won't be except for EU citizens dealing with another EU country's doctor. 'nuff said.</p>

<p>Hiring someone as a contractor involves a contract between two businesses. In most developed countries - and I assume Russia is no exception - you're operating as a de facto (unlimited liability) company when you work as a contractor. Whether formally incorporated or not the contractor is, much like you'd have been had you hired an employee, responsible for the same above mentioned stuff: social security and retirement benefits, PAYE if applicable, yada yada. From your standpoint you're basically shifting the administrative burden and employer-related costs onto the contractor. (This is assuming the contractor declares the revenue, but that's another problem altogether.)</p>

<p>Now, if you suddenly found yourself thinking ""oh of course, hiring contractors is what I should be doing!"", then think again because there's an endless stream of buts.</p>

<p>Enter labor laws.</p>

<p>Tax and labor inspectors of developed countries can - and routinely do - <em>re-qualify</em> contractors as employees, because of numerous abuses by local and international employers. Two key criteria they look for are whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're the sole order giver and they're the sole order taker. That is, they can't have employees or subcontractors do the work they're tasked with doing.</li>
<li>They mostly can't (i.e. they're basically full time) or aren't allowed to (i.e. non-compete or other) get other clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a bunch of other criteria that depend on the country. A local labor attorney will give you the full list. But the above two are the ones to be really wary of. (And yes, you're guessing right: nearly all full-time foreign contractors would tick those checkboxes.)</p>

<p>Of course, labor inspectors don't routinely barge into contractor homes and ask tough questions with an eye on re-qualifying them as employees. What usually happens is they become aware of such cases when the employer and the contractor part ways in unfriendly terms.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a nosy taxman might knock at their door, observe that they're contractors, and inquire about unpaid employer-related stuff or some other administrative irregularity. Manure can hit the fan really quickly when that happens.</p>

<p>Either way, should that ever happen to you, be wary of the Damocles that's hanging over your head: after some in-court fighting, which you'll lose with near certainty, you may end up responsible for paying everything you should have paid as a local employer, plus interest, fines, severance pay if applicable, and so forth. Provision accordingly.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy, for completeness' sake, is that courts in many if not all developed countries will enthusiastically receive labor-dispute related cases, and some countries are much more protective than others. Take, for instance, a US company hiring a French contractor with a UK-based contract (because they've a subsidiary there) and dispatching that person to Africa. Which labor laws apply? If you answered UK you're incorrect. The correct answer is that, if manure hits the fan and things start going to hell, the contractor can seek remedy in the UK because of the contract itself, in the African country they were dispatched to for being there, in - yes - France for being French, and possibly in the US to boot. In each of those countries, a court may end up re-qualifying the contractor as a local-law based employee.</p>

<p>Most contractors, for better or worse, are blissfully unaware of the peculiarities and subtleties of labor laws. But some won't be, so be sure to part on friendly terms that make everyone happy. And ideally make sure that your contractors are observing any legal obligations that may be related to being self-employed in their countries. (Tip: have them get a local accountant at your expense.)</p>

"Tips to look like a CEO","389","","<p>I believe we have a solid business plan, the money to make it possible, and the technical and management skills necessary to turn that plan into a successful business.

<p>That said, when signing contracts, I am worried that a prospective customer might think we are not a serious company because of my image. I don't think I look unprofessional as an employee, but I seem to give off some sort of ""poor man"" aura.

","<p>Being well groomed is half way through. Sharing a few things here from my similar experience.</p>

<ol>
<li>A suit stitched to your fit is better than the ready-made one; just give it a try, it does not have to be expensive one, but go to a good reputed tailor. Good suit that fits your body's shape and tone is half your battle</li>
<li>Face is the index of the mind (at least by proverb). So have a clean shaved face or have a proper beard or french beard according to your face size and shape. Keep it trimmed at all times. </li>
<li>I have an oily face, so I wash my face several times in client's location or my office rest room (splash of ice water is better) before I meet a client. I keep a wet wipe always to refresh myself before meeting clients when washing is not possible. </li>
<li>Hair style is also important. My hair is frenzy, so I take a full shower and keep it moist or use strongest gel to put every hair in place. I comb before meeting a client.</li>
<li>Brush your teeth before any meetings (don't spill water on your suit)</li>
<li>Make sure your suit stays dry, clean and ironed.</li>
<li>Blue shirts and black pants are considered very popular business wear</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Avoid these:</strong></p>

<ol start=""8"">
<li>Folded sleeves </li>
<li>pockets stuffed with papers and pens</li>
<li>key chains</li>
<li>torn jeans (i think you will anyway avoid this)</li>
<li>old looking accessories. It all has to be new or all should be moderately old; never wear a new pant with a faded shirt of vice-versa or make any accessory obviously odd. (like I used to wear my new shoes and belt with my old pants and shirt :)</li>
<li>cheap watches. (I used to wear a $10 Casio, it was damn comfortable for me as it showed the date time day etc. all at one view, but my manager said he bought such a cheap watch to his son for a sports outing in his school. So you know, I don't wear that any more.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Check yourself in front of a mirror in your office or client's place (you definitely can find one for sure) and do quick self-check. I do this all the time.</p>

<p>I assume that such laws exist given that virtually everything I look at has a serial number, country of origin, power requirement and manufacturer name. Any pointers to regulations? </p>
","<p>The two important legal marks are FCC DoC (Federal Communications Commission Declaration of Conformity and Certification, for the US) and CE (Conformité Européenne, for the EU). I'm unaware of the specifics involved in getting either, but both are probably must-haves in your case:</p>

<p>(These govern the need to show voltage and such.)</p>

<p>Other countries go as far as simply piggybacking on either or both of the latter. When they do not, they tend to get arm-wrestled into accepting them as <em>as is</em> substitutes for their own markings through trade agreements. (<em>Maybe</em> check for China and Japan, but I'd be surprised if either requires anything extra.)</p>

<p>Best I'm aware, the ""Made in..."" mark is somewhat murkier (as in no real legal framework):</p>

<p>(That basically covers the country of origin.)</p>

<p>Another mark that can matter is ISO certification. Getting it is basically a statement that you know what you're doing and have procedures in place to show for it. It's not <em>required</em>, but you can't go wrong getting it if you're dealing with clients who fuss about your quality control procedures or distributors who fuss about your ability to ship on time. At that point you'll be happy to have thrown money at getting certified, you'll say you're ISO-whatever, and the conversation shifts to the next point:</p>

The first is optional insofar as I'm aware, but the latter is mandatory for certain types of electronics in the EU. Also, certain rules apply with respect to using the recyclable symbol.</p>

  <p>where to look for a cheap lawyer with good quality to price ratio</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legal directories, like <a href=""http://www.legal500.com/"">The Legal 500</a> or <a href=""http://www.chambersandpartners.com/"">Chambers and Partners</a>, are a good place to find quality lawyers.  I suggest you look at smaller, regional firms.</p>

<p>However, good lawyers (and certainly those who are well-rated in the directories) generally  know their value and will charge accordingly.  That said, people tend to be quite loyal to their professional advisers: if you can convince one that you're going places and will bring them lots of business in the future, they might be willing to work for a reduced rate during your startup years.</p>

<p>Many organisations offer a degree of free legal advice to their customers: some business bank accounts come with some level of access to a lawyer; as does membership of many professional societies or other industry groups.</p>

<p>Some lawyers provide less costly (or even pro bono) clinics from time to time&mdash;either through their own firm, or through charities devoted to the purpose&mdash;but rarely does that happen for commercial subjects: it tends to be more typical for areas relevant to individuals, like family or immigration law.</p>

<p>You may find that someone who has some legal education (but who is not qualified) would be interested in helping out for low cost in order to build their own experience.  However, unless they advise you through an organisation set up for the purpose, they probably won't be covered by any insurance against providing faulty advice: that is a significant risk, both for you (they won't be able to remedy your loss) and for them (they could lose everything).</p>

<p>We currently don't have any staff. I run the technical side and my partner runs the business side. </p>

<p>I am ready to move onto another project. The business hasn't grown for at least the last 1-2 years, and I don't feel confident that we can grow it further. I would like to find a buyer for the business, but my partner enjoys her work, and believes she can grow the business further. </p>

<p>We don't have any partnership agreement covering what happens in this situation, so even though I would prefer to sell, if my partner doesn't want to sell, then I don't think I can force her. </p>

<p>One possibility is to hire a new CTO to replace me. My question is about what a ""standard"" and reasonable agreement would look like in this case, given that my partner will continue to work full-time. For example:</p>

<p>1) Would it be normal for our equity stakes to remain 50/50?</p>

<p>2) Would I have an input on the salary my business partner gets paid (given that I will no longer get a salary). </p>

<p>3) Would I have an input on the dividend that my partner and I both take from the company? </p>

<p>On the one hand, my partner is entitled to take more money from the business, given that she will be working full-time on it. But on the other hand, I am also entitled to benefit financially to some degree as I have invested 4 years growing it to this point.   </p>

<p>Any thoughts or stories of similar situations would be great. </p>

<p>Thanks,
Andrew</p>
","<p>What you're dealing with is very common. I am not sure if you have talked to your partner about this yet as it's not clear from your question, however, that is definitely the right place to start. I am assuming you have the best interests of both you and your partner in mind and I will base my answer on that assumption. <strong><em>If your intent is to get as much as you can out of the situation without regard to what happens to the business or your partner, this is not the answer for you.</em></strong></p>

<p>The most ideal situation would be for your partner to buy-out your 50% stake and, after a transitional period, for you both to go your own ways with regard to this business. I'll talk more about this at the end.</p>

<p>While you can certainly make suggestions on how the business should proceed (eg. hiring a CTO) as you have one foot out the door, it is not fair to your partner for you to have such marginally massive influence in such a small business over future decisions. It's great if you want to provide suggestions, train your replacement, or provide consulting on a part-time basis for a period of time to make sure things transition well (in fact you should do all these) -- but make sure you let your partner call the shots on how the business is going to proceed because she's the one who has to live with the circumstances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Would it be normal for our equity stakes to remain 50/50?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the size of your business and the nature of your cash flows: no, it would not be normal. You're running a small business that is <strong><em>not investable</em></strong>. A business with $300k in revenue with little potential for growth, even with very low expenses, is not an appropriate place to hold an equity investment (in this case, a ""limited partnership""). It may be a great small business that has provided you and your partner with a satisfactory income, but it is not large enough (by any measure) for you to treat as an investment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) Would I have an input on the salary my business partner gets paid (given that I will no longer get a salary).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean you could put your one vote in to limit your partner's salary and she could vote not to limit it and you could end up with no decision and a whole ton of anger -- or you can just do the right thing and step away.  It sounds like you are trying to become your partners boss which simply isn't going to happen since she has just as much say as you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) Would I have an input on the dividend that my partner and I both take from the company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dividends should be distributed based on equity ownership. The owners can decide to retain some earnings or to pay them out fully. The rate at which they are distributed after that depends on equity stakes (50/50 in this case). Of course if you two have a conflict, you will not be able to make a decision with your 1-1 vote and be in a very difficult situation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One possibility is to hire a new CTO to replace me.</p>
  
  <p>I am also entitled to benefit financially to some degree as I have invested 4 years growing it to this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much do you think the CTO that will replace you needs to be paid to perform the same tasks as you? If it's about the same as your share of the profits, then your half of the business is literally worth <strong>zero on paper</strong>, regardless of how many years and how much blood, sweat, and tears you've poured into this.</p>

<hr>

<p>The best way to handle this situation is for your partner to buy out your half and for you to help with the transition to a reasonable degree (possibly with compensation). If your partner does not have the financial ability to pay you in a lump-sum, she can pay you in installments over time. The exact amount of the buy-out would have to be determined between the two of you, but just based on the raw numbers you presented, it should not be particularly high.</p>

<p>If it becomes difficult to come up with an exact buy-out number, you can hire a financial analyst to value the business and make a decision based on that. There are professionals who deal with this exact situation all the time as it is very common.</p>

<p>In your next partnership, it would be smart to set up rules for situations like this from the start. That way resolving situations such as when a partner is no longer in the business becomes easy. Your situation is actually pretty simple. This stuff can get really nasty when, for example, the spouse of a deceased general partner inherits a business she does not understands and expects it to produce the same income in perpetuity with no participation.</p>

"How To Narrow Down Your Target Market","376","","<p>I'm working on an idea where the potential market is all consumers who go on vacation; It's a travel related business.</p>

<p>Are there any processes or best practices for narrowing down your total potential market to a target market. So far, I've only come up with starting geographically.</p>
","<p>As your product becomes more specialized, so should your market. Every business has one <em>core service</em> they do extremely well, and until you find out how that core functionality behaves, it's basically impossible to logically break down your target market to make it specific enough to mean something. Look at companies like Starbucks, Walmart, or even Chipotle. Concepts change, and you eventually adapt to your market and cast your net in the most logical place to catch as many fish as possible.</p>

<p>It should basically be a one to one relationship. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start with people who like vacations.</p></li>
<li><p>Find what sets you apart from other vacation companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the subset of the generic ""vacations"" market that applies to your subset service.</p></li>
<li><p>Market away and have fun fishing :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea, then, is to try and build your business in a way that the subset of people in the vacation industry like your service so much that they adapt to it, and can't help but share their increased happiness and share it with their other vacationers. That's how you build retention and loyalty. Your company becomes a brand, and everybody knows you for that brand - so make it strong.</p>

<p>If you want more resources, check out <a href=""http://www.inc.com/guides/201104/how-to-narrow-your-target-market.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> on the importance of specifying your target market - offering one core service is how every large business started. It's just how people work. It's just like any other process - break it down until you've identified the <em>core components</em> of a customer that would actually buy your <em>core service</em>. That's how you break it down.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense. Best of luck in your ventures.</p>

"What key intellectual property should a startup focus on gathering?","373","","<p>We know that venture capitalists keep a keen eye on the intellectual properties possessed by a company in order to make investment decisions in it.</p>

<p>Do the intellectual property really matters if we are starting new?
OR
In order to gain capitalists' interest in the startup, what are the most important intellectual property to have with startup (among these: domain names, copyrights, patents, patents pending, trade secrets, trademarks) ?</p>
","<p>This is somewhat subjective based on your type of business, but I would say that patents are the most important, just because they generally have the most coverage and usefulness. But really, it's just all dependent on the type of business you're hoping to build. It's generally best to speak with an attorney (a patent attorney, specifically) to assess what IP is right for your business. This conversation should certainly happen before any investor meetings, too. Just make sure you have an NDA signed with whomever you choose to disclose your inventions to.</p>

<p><strong>Trademarks and Copyrights</strong></p>

<p>Copyrights are immediately present once you create your artwork, and trademarks are immediately present when you start using your name in commerce. They aren't incredibly enforceable until you register them, but you have them. In general, if you have something to copyright that you'll be putting out there a lot, however, it's better to do it. In the United States, a copyright is an easy application with a fee of $35, but if you need it expedited due to an upcoming lawsuit, that price rises to--I believe--$800. So it's a good investment if you're worried about people copying your artwork. Trademarks are good if you're working on a website, or something that will be used nationally, because they prohibit any other companies in the nation from starting with the same name as you.</p>

<p><strong>Patents</strong></p>

<p>On the other hand, patents are not implicit. You need to apply for a patent and, in fact, if you make a public disclosure of your invention, you'll be risking your patentability long-term. Because of that, it's important to make sure you have the right protection before you even speak with potential investors for your own good, even aside from whether it will increase their likelihood of investing. Just remember, obviously, that you can only patent something that's patentable. So if you have no novel processes or inventions (that's a bad description of patentability, but that's more a question for <a href=""http://patents.stackexchange.com"">Ask Patents</a> anyway), that's not super useful. In essence, I'd say the rule of thumb to follow is you should get a patent if: one, your invention is patentable, and two, you intend to make over a hundred thousand dollars from it. That's an arbitrary number, but I've heard it quoted before and it's pretty reasonable, I'd say.</p>

<p><strong>Trade Secrets</strong></p>

<p>Trade secrets are a bit different since there is no, of course, registration process. They tend to happen over the course of natural business, if you let them. The idea of a trade secret is that if you have a process that can't be reversed engineered and that not many people have to know about, your IP will inherently be kept yours until you tell someone about it. You can read more on that and patents on an <a href=""https://patents.stackexchange.com/a/7840/10011"">answer I once posted on Ask Patents</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Domain Names</strong></p>

<p>Domain names are good practice to buy just on principle. For something like $13, you can be sure nobody else will buy out your name online for a year. It's a worthy investment on just about any type of business.</p>

"How many shares lower salary is worth?","371","","<p>Founder of a startup or at least the idea owner asked me how we could work together? He would hire me as CFO for his idea, but can only pay 1/3 of the standard salary of an iOS develoler. But he would give me portion of the incomes we earn through In-App puchases. What do you think, what is a reasonable proportion I could accept from income? All income would come through App Store purchases. I am the only developer, his contribution is the basic idea and to help my work with new impression, provide the features, specifications to implement, testing the app, check out market and so on.</p>

<p>At the end I have to say / argue about a certain percentage i.e. 10%, 20% .. 90%. But I do not know which one is the most reasonable. I do not see / I can not say to much about my expectations / risk etc., so I need an easy approach, argumentation. Like: If I would get full salary available on market that 0% of the income I would ask for. Now I get only 30% of market salary, so I would ask for 70% of the incomes. Any opinion about it?</p>
","<p>The amount of shares you can ask for directly relates to the amount of risk you are willing to take, and how many other people are taking risks. In your scenario you are getting a salary, while it is small, it is more than the founder is getting. He is banking on the return from the sales of your app. Given that, there are some general principles to keep in mind, I would recommend that you read Ben Collins' answer <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/2/dividing-profits-amongst-developers-and-designers"">here</a> Since it goes over much of what I will talk about.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Risk = shares</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The more risk you put into a company, the more you deserve of its profits. If you and the founder are both accepting equal risk, you deserve equal shares. From what you said in your question you are not accepting equal risk. You need to decide how much risk you're willing to put in the company. Do you want to split the profits 50-50 and not gain a salary? do you want to accept a lower amount, say 30%, and accept a salary? </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>Work done</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p>Who is doing all the work in your company? Are you the only one actually doing anything? Is your friend going to his other job, and asking you to do all the work? While I doubt this is the case, you need to consider what kind of a time investment you are making. If your investment is significantly higher, then consider asking for a bigger portion of the company, ie you accept a salary, but you are the only one actually working so you still split it 50-50.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Are other people splitting the shares</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p>Is there an investor, or perhaps another founder who is helping with the app. This makes a huge difference in deciding how much you should ask for. still the same principles from above apply, simply determine what an equal share would be, then subtract that same percentage based on your analysis ie you accept a salary and there are two of you then you take half of a half of the company (25%)</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>How much do you believe in the company</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a analysis of your belief in the company. While this may sound weird when asking for shares, remember that the amount of shares you take out of the company relates to what you are willing to put in, or your own personal investment in the company. If you aren't willing to give it your all, consider taking a smaller portion. If you are willing to stay up late, work weekends, sell the product to everyone you see, then you are going to be more invested in the company and therefore need a bigger portion of the stock. Basically what you take out is how much of the company you are directly responsible for doing. if its 25% you are doing 25% of all the work, at 50% you are doing half of all thats done at the company etc. Determine what you are willing to do, and ask for it.</p>

<hr>

<p>After all that consideration (and potentially a little math) approach your friend, and propose to him you offer, and your explanation. He needs to understand why you feel you deserve what you do. Be sure not to get locked in a deal you will regret, that works both ways don't take more risk than you can, or undersell yourself. </p>

<p>I think a real point to point comparison might be useful to more people than specific advices in my case.</p>

<p>In your answer please state if you are an entrepreneur or VC</p>

<p>From my own research, here is what I found :</p>

<ul>
<li>The Safe is much easier to understand. Three options : Cap no Discount (Give a percentage for a given price), No Cap but discount (Ensure he will have a X time return on investment), Cap or Discount (Ensure he will have the best between X% shares or a Y time return on investment.</li>
<li>The Seedsummit document pre-negociates some term for the preferred stock. Like the number of board members. The safe will just assume that those terms will be negotiated later during the A round.</li>
<li>Seedsummit seems much more investor friendly, as stated in their <a href=""http://www.seriesseed.com/posts/2010/09/version-20-and-why-series-seed-documents-are-better-than-capped-convertible-notes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">own blog</a> : </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>To clarify, there is no question that as an entrepreneur you would prefer uncapped convertible debt to equity.  As Josh and many others point out, this is typically not a fair deal for the investors and many investors won’t do it, or will only do it for people that they are blindly in love with. </p>
</blockquote>
","<p>A good alternative for a seed round is to use convertible debt instead, it will allow to defer the decision on valuation to the series A. With the convertible note it is also typical to have a discount of 10-30% for the initial seed investors.  </p>

  Marketers In Prison</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is there money in affiliate marketing?</strong> My gut says no, but looking for a notable source that provides a bit more analysis of the industry.</p>
","<p>Absolutely there is. I used to make decent money at it - I hadn't been doing it very long before I quit my day job to go at it full-time.</p>

<p>I don't do it (actively) anymore because I was relying on all of my traffic through SEO (95%+ on most of my sites was coming from Google). And I realized that I didn't like the feeling of  having all of my eggs in one basket and knowing that any morning I could wake up to check my daily reports and I could have thousands more dollars than I did the previous day or I could have nothing and it was all at Google's whim. So I decided to make some changes, and rather than actively searching for other traffic sources I decided to shift gears completely and start promoting things I cared more about. </p>

<p>I was on track to make 6 figures my second year focusing on affiliate marketing (would have been my first full year doing it full-time if I hadn't stopped mid-year).  Obviously that's not filthy rich, but if one person could do that without any special training, that's enough for me to say there's some money in it - and I know people that were way more successful with it than me.</p>

<p>But that certainly doesn't mean everyone that tries it makes money - there are many more who try and fail than those who succeed.</p>

<p>And it doesn't mean it's easy, there's a lot of fluffy sales letters floating around about how you can click a few buttons and make millions. Obviously as with ANY industry, those are a load of crock.</p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.skimlinks.com/2012/02/08/it%E2%80%99s-not-a-secret/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pinterest seemed to think there was some money in affiliate marketing</a></p>

<p>And so do sites like ebates.com - though that's a different angle than most affiliate marketing takes.</p>

<p>Something else to keep in mind is that when someone says affiliate marketing,  the first thing a lot of people think of is Amazon or maybe eBay. But most major retailers have a program that you can either sign up for directly through them or through affiliate networks like Commission Junction or LinkShare.  There are also a lot of smaller niche products that can be promoted sometimes with a higher commission.</p>

<p>And affiliate marketing isn't all retail either. A lot of web services offer affiliate programs (for example I know a number of people that had popular blogs and made a fair amount of money off of HostGator as they got a significant number of requests for host recommendations).</p>

<p>A lot of those software services that offer affiliate programs will also offer a recurring commission rather than a one-time payment. That can be a good way to build up income overtime if you're referring people to a service they're likely to stick with.</p>

<p><a href=""http://marketingland.com/affiliate-marketing-trends-for-2013-29374"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> has some interesting related info as well as  a  link to a white paper done by Forrester Research predicting affiliate marketing to become a $4.5 billion industry by 2016.  (Have to put in contact info to read the actual white paper unfortunately).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to more directly address this comment in your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Appears that the eBay's average affiliate likely makes almost nothing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a similar fashion to how you could say most startups make nothing/next to nothing, I would agree that the average affiliate makes next to nothing (across the board - let's not even limit it to eBay).</p>

<p>In the same way that everyone hears about a couple college dropouts starting a multi-billion dollar business in their garage and thinks it must be easy to run a successful business, all those fluffy sales letters make everyone think it must be easy to make a load of cash at affiliate marketing.  Then in both cases, a large portion of those that don't have the right combination of drive and knowledge/skillsets fail because it's harder and more complicated than they expected.</p>

<p>So I would be willing to bet the Pareto principle applies to that 70 million from eBay (20% of the affiliates earn 80% of the commissions). And I wouldn't be surprised if the percentages are even more skewed toward the top than that.</p>

<p>That was an interesting article you linked to - I hadn't heard that story of the creator of Digital Point Solutions (I'm assuming that's the company behind the Digital Point forums?) getting raided by the FBI... But taking the total 70 million from <em>one (admittedly large - but certainly not the largest) company</em> and dividing by their total number of affiliates and realizing that the <em>average (worthless number for this purpose)</em> eBay affiliate earns less than 3k/yr from eBay isn't a valid reasoning to assume that there's no money there.  I would bet more accurately that the <strong><em>vast majority</em></strong> make less than $100/yr and the cream of the crop make the bulk of that $70 million (or whatever is left of it after you knock off the fraudulent activity mentioned in that article).</p>

<p>And that's one company. There are tens of thousands of companies with affiliate marketing programs in just about whatever industry you can think of and most successful affiliate marketers have income coming in from more than one source.</p>

If you can't get enough users for your app to be useful, then you should really try to make it useful with the current user base.</p>

<p>If the users love it, can't you make the app so that it's at least tiny bit viral?</p>

<p>Your app sounds like it's local (you mention needing 20k users in Paris), why not just go get users off the streets?

However I was told point blank by the people who run the incubator that the investor will get a flat 7%. What is correct? How much will the investor get if our company is valued at 1,000,000? 10,000,000? $500,000? The safe note says the following. <strike>Sorry I cant post the whole thing.</strike> The draft version attached below.</p>

<p>The following clauses are part of the safe note</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$20,000 (the “Purchase Amount”)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “Dilution Cap” is $285,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Equity Financing. If there is an Equity Financing before the
  expiration or termination of this instrument,
  the Company will automatically issue to the Investor either: (1) a
  number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to 
  the Purchase Amount divided by the price per share of the Standard
  Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less 
  than or equal to the Dilution Cap; or (2) a number of shares of Safe
  Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided 
  by the Safe Price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the
  Dilution Cap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Safe Price” means the price per share equal to the Dilution Cap divided by the Company Capitalization.</p>
  
  <p>“Company Capitalization” means the sum, as of immediately prior to the
  Equity Financing, of: (1) all shares of Capital Stock (on an
  as-converted basis) issued and outstanding, assuming exercise or
  conversion of all outstanding vested and unvested options, warrants
  and other convertible securities, but excluding (A) this instrument,
  (B) all other Safes, and (C) convertible promissory notes; and (2) all
  shares of Common Stock reserved and available for future grant under
  any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company, and/or any equity
  incentive or similar plan to be created or increased in connection
  with the Equity Financing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Attached is the ""draft version"" that is almost exactly the same language, with the exception of the dilution cap being $700 more.</p>

<p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B76aLKz21sLKandfckY3RTNOczg/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">Draft version of document</a></p>
","<p>The dilution cap is there to ensure that the investor gets their 7% when you raise another round.</p>

<p>The only way that this percentage will increase is if your valuation in the next round is <strong>lower</strong> than the dilution cap.</p>

<p>So, if for example your valuation in the next round was $100,000 this is below the dilution cap and so would invoke the clause:</p>

<p>""a number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less than or equal to the Dilution Cap""</p>

<p>Giving them (rough sum) : 20K (purchase amount) / 100k (valuation) *100 (percent) = 20%</p>

<p>If you managed to get a $1 million valuation in the next round, instead of them getting:</p>

<p>20K / 1M * 100 = 2%</p>

<p>It would invoke clause 2:</p>

<p>"" a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Safe Price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the Dilution Cap.""</p>

<p>replacing the valuation with the dilution cap of 285K, ensuring the worst deal for them is:</p>

<p>20K / 285K * 100 = 7%</p>

<p>So as long as your valuation in the next round is above the dilution price they will get 7%</p>

"As the CEO & Founder of a Tech Startup how do I distribute profits in my case?","353","","<p>I am the CEO at a Tech Startup and I also put money in the company (taking it from my parents). There are 2 friends of mine also working with me. One of them is the CTO and the other one is Technical Architect. I have listed my brother and sister as directors of the Pvt. Ltd. company in India. We have been in operations since February but have started receiving money in April. I work the most and the home office is at my place itself and I bare all the expenses (taking it from my parents). I can anytime ask for my brother and sister for money who are listed as directors. The CTO and CTA work full time, day and night but only on Technology and not on weekends whereas I work on everything from Tech, Managing projects, Distributing expenses, emailing and talking to clients, drafting documents and agreements and all the other things. </p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>Q1. Can a Tech company have a CTO and a Technical Architect both at the same time? Will it affect when we go for funding? </p>

<p>Q2. Who has the rights over income? And how much? </p>

<p>Q3. Should I first cover all the expenses from the revenues and then divide whatever is left (profit) between all of us? </p>

<p>Q4. The seed investors here are my parents. How do I pay them back? Should I also list them as directors? </p>

<p><strong>Profit Sharing</strong></p>

<p>After all expenses are paid or kept aside for the current month, the remaining profit will be divided as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Company (for future growth): 32% </li>
<li>Me: 32% </li>
<li>CTO: 16% </li>
<li>CTA: 16% </li>
<li>Director1: 2% </li>
<li>Director2: 2%</li>
</ul>

<p>Q5. How feasible is this Profit sharing plan in long term? Should someone receive more or less than what is mentioned?</p>

<p>Q6. Should I also mention how much each member will be diluted if someone puts in big money? </p>

<p>Note: <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/8892/how-should-i-as-a-ceo-manage-expense-people-profits-etc-at-my-tech-startup"">My previous question</a> was put on hold for being too broad. I have many other questions that I will link this to. Thanks a lot in advance. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Q1. Can a Tech company have a CTO and a Technical Architect both at
  the same time? Will it affect when we go for funding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no limits in regards of a company structure how many different similar positions you have, it comes down to the fact what needs to be done, and who can do it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q2. Who has the rights over income? And how much?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually everyone get's their base salary, and profit sharing is done as set intervals (once a year for instance) When profit sharing, you take a base % aside for securities and basic operations coverage and with the management decide how big of a share goes out for payment. The payment is distributed based on everyones equity in the company.</p>

<p>If you have 3%, then you are entitled to 3% of what is being paid out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q3. Should I first cover all the expenses from the revenues and then
  divide whatever is left (profit) between all of us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually when covering expenses with your own money, you put/invest money into the company and for that based on a decided evaluation you have the right for an equity increase (Dillutes others). See my answer to the previous question, that you should decide how much you need to cover expenses and set aside some money for covering operational costs. never pay out all of the profits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q4. The seed investors here are my parents. How do I pay them back?
  Should I also list them as directors?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your parents as seed investors should receive an equity in the company and payouts from profits accordingly. In this case, you should create some sort of a convertible loan agreement, where at one point your parents input in converted into eqity based on a set/agreed evaluation. Mostly this is node when raising a seond round, and they get a discount on the purchase price.</p>

<p>Or you can just treat it as a loan and pay back with an interest, if you wish so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q5. How feasible is this Profit sharing plan in long term? Should
  someone receive more or less than what is mentioned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone should get a cut based on their equity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q6. Should I also mention how much each member will be diluted if
  someone puts in big money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ofcourse. And the dillution is also based on the equity everyone has.</p>

<p>For instance if raising money enough for selling 10% of equity, everyone in most general scenarios gives away 10% of their equity.</p>

<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<p>Best,</p>

"How effective are free app promotions?","353","","<p>There are several services that offer their users free apps. They work by partnering with app developers who agree to offer their app for free for a short period of time (normally a day or week) and pay a fee in return for their app being advertised. It's an enticing pitch for developers who have just released an app and are looking for traction, but does it actually work?</p>

<p>They promise thousands of free downloads during the promotion, but is there any evidence that this translates into more paid downloads later on?</p>
","<p>To understand ""free for a day,"" you need to <strong>focus on the principle and away from the mechanism</strong>.</p>

<p>""Free"" is a big attention draw, but learning what people might accept for free tells you nothing about what they might pay for. In consumer goods, ""free"" can be a relatively low-cost way of getting a consumer to try your product and at least recognise it in future. But Mercedes isn't going to launch its latest model by giving it away free for a month.</p>

<p>Apps are more like Mercedes vehicles than they are like chocolate bars. So if you give them away, it needs to be because you need an initial user base, or access to different types of user than you have now, or because your monetization strategy isn't all about the buy price.</p>

<p>If one of those applies to you, the many free for a day / week / month sites and apps out there could be worthwhile, as could coupons for in-app purchases distributed other ways.</p>

<p>Once you've decided it could be right for you, it's time to understand the mechanics in fine detail, because the mechanics of your particular app ecosystem, and of the free app promoter, are going to have an impact. Here are the main tripping hazards I've seen, but get out and scan for blog posts, because things can change fast.</p>

<p><strong><em>Free,</em> or <em>free upgrade</em>?</strong></p>

<p>If you are just looking for volume, low friction is vital. Every step you add to the process increases the drop-out rate. Some app ecosystems have a free trial mechanism; some expressly prohibit your free app becoming paid. So go through what you have to do initially, and what you have to do longer-term, and if there's extra hassle, weigh that in as a cost.</p>

<p>To mitigate complexity, you'll see a lot of people using these services to offer a free (forever) app, with a free (for now) premium upgrade. In the success case, that gives some fine-grained control over what happens to the free cohort over time. But it will be difficult or impossible to know whether you would have got better results if you had avoided that high friction complication.</p>

<p><strong>Hate bait</strong></p>

<p>In your head, your app is going to be great for a certain type of user, in a certain use case. Having a paid app makes that outcome more likely: even if your app is a penny, I'll pause for a moment before paying.</p>

<p>Go free, even for a day, and suddenly you have people using your app who you didn't build it for. If they're unhappy, you don't mind... <strong>only that's where your ratings are going to flood in from</strong>. Never mind they got something for nothing, Joe public is going to one star your app for its unfriendly interface, even though it clearly stated it was only for nuclear physicists.</p>

<p>So take nothing on trust. Don't just check the ""free app"" references they give you. Sign up yourself, take up every offer, and watch the results. You need to know what kind of apps are going to be well-received, and if it's not your kind, steer clear of the haters.</p>

<p><strong>Free, or worthless?</strong></p>

<p>I see a lot of people push buggy v0.1 of their app out through this kind of channel. The logic goes - why would I invest time in making my app shine unless lots of people want it? If they come in droves, I'll fix it then.</p>

<p>This sucks. The site or app that gave me the free offer told me a story about how I'd get something valuable on a limited offer freebie, it didn't tell me they were filling a skip with junk, help yourself.</p>

<p>Don't use these services that way. It's actually surprisingly cheap to pay people to try your app and give you feedback. So if you love your idea, invest at least as far as debugged v1.0. Or if it's the idea itself you want to test, pare it back to an MVP that you can build well.</p>

<p><strong>So what?</strong></p>

<p>The services you describe are one of a number of channels that can help you leverage the impact of ""free."" If ""free"" isn't good for your app, steer clear. If it could be, then you need to understand the options, and choose with care. Beware the stories of success and the tales of woe. It doesn't matter how this worked for them, it only matters how it <em>might</em> work for you.</p>

"What are the problems with the ""lean startup"" method?","352","","<p>Having read through a few ""Lean Startup"" books it appears to me that's the way to go for Silicon Valley type of startups. The books paint a beautiful picture of manageable risk and high profile success stories (e.g. Groupon, Quicken etc. and of course the spiritual mother Toyota).</p>

<p>While the outlined methods make a great deal of sense to me and I'd also love to try them, the claims of success are still largely based on anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of instances where ""Lean Startup"" was a failure or caused significant problems and delays?</p>

<p>For example: one method outlined in ""Running Lean"" (Ash Maurya) is conducting ""problem interviews"" before defining a ""minimal viable product"" - the focus is on solving existing problems real customers have and trying to gauge if there is a real interest in your solutions or how to adapt your solutions to be minimal (to the point) and still attractive and marketable.</p>

<p>What about technological innovation that basically creates ""new problem spaces"" and introduces something to the world that did not exist like that before (such as the telephone, TV, or Internet). Could ""problem interviews"" be a waste of time, when interviewees cannot follow your vision and ideas? I know, you could still argue that the existing problem space before the invention of the telephone was ""long distance communication is difficult and slow"". But were people back then really having that problem and missing something, that would justify the risk of creating the telephone in the sense of ""lean startup""? Both telephone and Internet brought people closer together and created an environment where we expect more from our lives (being able to quickly communicate and socialize online). About 16 years ago I had absolutely no cravings for meeting people online and I got my knowledge from books and the library.</p>

<p>To wrap it up: what could be points that would speak against the use of ""lean startup"" methods? Are there any real world examples for failure?</p>
","<p>Most of the problems with the lean startup approach are the people using it, not the approach itself. The simplicity of the lean startup leads people to believe it will make finding a business model easy, it only makes it easier. </p>

<p>Speaking to this issue, I see having seen a bit of Ash Maurya's data for LeanStack.com, and as far as I'm able to tell, most people on average only create one canvas, try the process and appear to give up.</p>

<p>As with most approaches, you only really understand the process after having used it for real a number of times - and most people attempt to use it, before learning how to use it.</p>

<p>To that end, if you're really interested in trying the process, take an concept you know you already understand, model it, do customer development, do an MVP, etc. - then throw in a pivot, then do the process again, and lastly, create a new canvas from scratch, and repeat the whole process. Do all of this not to find a viable business, but to get a sense of the flow of using the process in the real world.</p>

"Reasonable equity expectations for a CTO","350","","<p>I've read a number of articles and discussions on how equity should be split and it's clear that it's determined by a case-by-case basis and very much depends on the circumstances.

<p>A online marketplace startup is looking for a CTO to join.</p>

<p>The whole team consists of a founder with a business development focus, a co-founder with a marketing and business development focus, a graphic designer and two people who brings significant networking value. </p>

"Why do Reddit, Craigslist etc. not develop their own mobile app?","350","","<p>All the apps in the store are made by third party people. Why don't they make their own apps? </p>

<p>There are lots of other companies like these which don't have an app of their own.</p>

They created an official app, <a href=""http://www.redditblog.com/2009/01/i-read-it-on-ireddit-official-reddit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">iReddit</a> in 2009. It wasn't very popular so they deprecated it and recommended users to use a third party app or the mobile site.</p>

<p>Making an app costs money and involves technologies that the development team probably isn't familiar with. It's more profitable to focus on improving their core product. When asked about reddit's lack of a mobile app, and admin <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1u9uqa/eli5_why_isnt_there_an_official_reddit_app/ceg6vv1"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our reasoning is that instead of putting time and effort into our own app, we'd rather work on providing an environment that enables other awesome app developers to build apps.
  Can't say that won't change in the future, but it has been our guiding principle over the past few years.</p>

<p>Mobile apps are nice to have but not critical for many sites. Reddit, Craigslist and Stack Exchange were able to do very well without having their own official app but allowing third party developers to make one.

<p>In a nutshell, iterate with groups of 5-6 users. In each step, you'll encounter the pieces of information that stick out, and you'll already begin to find duplicate points. Address them, and then restart the process with a different set of users (if possible... if not, find 15-20 users and split them in 3 groups).</p>

<p>Important point: you <em>need</em> to conduct synchronous, qualitative information gathering to get meaningful data. This means actually interacting with the users in a reasonably live environment -- as in speech or interactive chat. You want the raw, unprocessed, undigested information.</p>

<p>If the information gathering is asynchronous, as would be the case with email, forums, forms, and so forth, you run the risk of missing out on very salient data because users will rephrase what they mean to make it shorter or draw their own conclusions.</p>

","<p>Lean Startup was first proposed by Eric Ries in 2008 and the topic was further explored in his 2011 best selling book with the same name. Eric himself was influenced by some of the early ideas about the topic by Steve Blank. The key principles of the Lean Startup movement are described on the Lean Startup website (<a href=""http://theleanstartup.com/principles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theleanstartup.com/principles</a>). They refer to the ubiquitous nature of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Startups need to engage in validated learning the key aspects of which are Build, Measure and Learn.</p>

<p>This typically involves building an MVP or minimum viable product, that can allow you to test your hypothesis with real customers to validate your idea. Using A/B testing to measure and constantly improve your product and build something your customers really want. </p>

<li>As I said I don't have the cash flow for now, is that something that is going to stop me, or there is a chance to fight?</li>
</ul>

<p>My question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the light of these facts, what are realistic steps that I should take?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Maybe the first thing you should do is a SWOT. Find your Strength and Weaknesses and compare the opportunities and the threats of your project. Then try to focus on your strength and find someone to compensate your weaknesses. Convince someone of your idea with the opportunities and how you guys will handle the threats.</p>

<p>Also outline your business: What is the difference between your users and customers? Whats your value proposition? Get your self a list of your Key Partners, Key Resources and Key Activities. (for more google canvas business model)</p>

<p>Q1:
If you have a software which fits your needs, take it! Developing a own is always more expensive, takes time, rises risks etc. (Of course this case is only true, there is an real alternative.) In your case outsourcing is the only thing left or find a developer for as co-founder. Learn coding would take you at least a year until you have the experience to write own applications and social media projects are quite heavy on logical content and big data (in other words very complex).</p>

<p>Q2:
Cash flow for now? Either you mean you have no idea for monetization of the project, then stop and find one. Or you mean you have no income (your private situation). Then ask your self, how long can you hold that state, do you have backup from your family for your decisions and are there alternatives like part time jobs etc. I'm also on an idea. To pay the designers, I do freelancing as a project manager and web developer.</p>

","<p>Age never stops someone to start and run a business. What you really need to focus on is ""Idea"" and how you can convert it in sales and hence profit. I personally am a part of more than 150 small and micro businesses and the first thing I think of today after a lot of failures is if something I want to sell is worth buying. I do some pre-business surveys like go and ask the people I think could be my potential clients if they would be interested to buy the services or product I would be offering at the given price tag. And if not what would they expect from a business like this. Learn about the competition. Understand your personal finances and how much you are willing to contribute towards your business. Understand the Legal, Tax and other obligations. Get the data, brainstorm over the data, and be realistic. Only after a strong YES invest your money, time and effort.</p>

<p>Though I would love to see each and every person become an entrepreneur and build their businesses, I also know 90% of the business fail during the first few years it starts. And some of them start with great ideas but they cannot attract enough attention and sales. Sometimes the ideas and products are too ahead of its time and the business owners can't simply don't have patience or resources and they give up.</p>

I've been doing research all day and night, but I'm still clueless as exactly how I should approach this situation. How should I evaluate my software? What steps should be taken? Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>BASICALLY:</strong> They want to pay for a copy of the software without the right to redistribute(They say their plans are for internal use and not redistribution of any kind) and keep me as the developer. Where would I go from there?</p>
","<p>One of the options is to start a company that would be a legal framework around this product of yours and then for them to buy out half of the company for amount you negotiate - you can't really become a co-owner of a product, it's not a house. In this case your software should become property of the company.</p>

<p>How to approach the situation is with communication - you should clarify what exactly do they mean by this offer, and what exactly do they mean by co-ownership? What does that imply exactly?</p>

<p>As a sidenote, it is a rather interestingly formed question by such a large company, as companies of this size usually have enough resources to just buy your software along with the rights completely.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>If that is indeed the case you must negotiate fallowing - do they want you as a contractor or as an employee? What are their expectations towards development - will they be able to define new requirements for the project and you will have to implement them? What is their compensation offer - fixed monthly/yearly, per hours, other? These are the general questions you should ask and decide on how to proceed when you have answers.</p>

"Should I hire a team for my business idea, will that be safe?","342","","<p>I have a business plan in mind that sounds sort of new to the market and can be a major game changer..</p>

<p>I am currently working on my own, but that is going very slowly.</p>
","<p>You may be able to protect your business idea in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><h3>Patents</h3>

<p>If your idea involves an ""inventive step"", it may be something that can be protected by patent registration.  If so, any such competing product that the employee goes on to create would infringe your patented rights and you would be able (through the courts) to obtain relief against your losses in the form of damages.</p>

<p>However, if your idea does not involve any such ""inventive step"" then it won't be patentable.</p></li>
<li><h3>Trade secrets</h3>

<p>Even if you do not register a patent but it would not be obvious to anyone outside your business how to implement your idea, then the employee may be in possession of your ""trade secrets"" that amount to confidential information.  His use of such information for his own benefit could amount to a breach of confidence for which you might have a claim against him.</p></li>
<li><h3>Non-compete clauses</h3>

<p>It is quite normal for an employment contract to stipulate that, after termination, the employee will not compete with your business for a stipulated period of time (e.g. 12 months).  This would give you an opportunity to fix your ""botched up"" website before their competing version comes online.</p>

<p>However, you should be aware that courts are often reluctant to enforce such terms, especially if they entirely prevent the (former) employee from working within his profession.  Thus a non-compete that attempts to prevent a website developer working on website development might be considered unenforceable; whereas one that prevents work on your specific business idea might not.</p></li>

"Is not offering a free trial a bad idea for a new product?","341","","<p>I'm working on a project that will help users manage servers from remote. This service will use my servers, and for that, I will have to buy those servers up front.</p>

<p>For information, the service is Uncovr, you can find it at <a href=""http://uncovr.it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uncovr.it</a></p>

<p>I first thought about offering a 15 days free trial, but I'm wondering if this is a great idea : I'm affraid that I will have too many curious users that will only try the app, and not go further the 15 days trial. This will led me to buy too many ""unpaid"" servers and may fail the whole project in term of cash.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I really would like to let people try before paying and I'm pretty sure this is a feature I will enable if/when the project is working and I can pay the servers without having money difficulties.</p>

<p>But for starting, I'm wondering if not offering a free trial is a bad idea.</p>

<p>In my opinion, forcing the user to pay to use at first day will bring only really interested users, but I may loose others that would first see, and then be interested to pay.</p>

<p>I don't have much experience on that side, that's why I'm asking it to you.</p>
","<p>There are a LOT of businesses offering free trials. They've clearly determined it makes sense for their business.  But there's plenty of successful businesses that do not offer free trials and are doing just fine.</p>

  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>In my opinion, forcing the user to pay to use at first day will bring only really interested users, but I may loose others that would first see, and then be interested to pay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right there, is the summary of your issue. There is a cost to offering free trials, and there is a cost to NOT offering a free trial option.  </p>

<p>So the real question is: ""Which potential cost is greater?"" </p>

<p>The answer to that is going to depend on your business model.</p>

<p>If you're going for growth as quickly as possible at whatever cost necessary (as many well funded startups do), then you would absolutely want to offer a free trial. </p>

<p>If you're bootstrapped and looking for a slower growth model that guarantees you can still pay your bills, the better option might be to skip the free trial for now and go only with paying customers as they're the ones that keep electricity flowing to the servers.  Growth will almost certainly be slower if you go this route, but sometimes slow growth is safer growth depending on the business model.</p>

<p>There is another option that's somewhere between the two - but first here are some things to consider:</p>

<p>I consider the cost of a free trial offer to be a marketing expense. It is an attempt to attract a new customer just like any other marketing tactic. With many marketing strategies you're paying for exposure to people that may or may not be interested in your service (though hopefully it's at least targeted to people that are <em>likely</em> to be interested). With a free trial, you <strong>KNOW</strong> they are interested in your service - otherwise they wouldn't be using it.</p>

<p>Depending on exactly what your service is, people that sign up use the service for a day before deciding it's not for them and never touch it again, may not cost you as much as someone that uses the service heavily for the full extent of the free trial. Yet those that use it the most heavily are likely the ones most willing to pay for it. So the ones potentially costing you the most may be the ones most likely to turn into paying customers when it's over and those that abandon it may not cost as much comparatively.</p>

<p>Many companies that offer free trials do it not simply out of generosity, but because they've figured out that a certain percent of people will sign up, put in their cc info, and forget to cancel.  Thus the company gets their payment at least for the first month even if the customer doesn't stay with them. Some companies offer refunds if the customer calls in to complain about it, still  knowing that many customers won't bother. Other companies make it hard to get a refund or don't offer them at all.  Some even make it difficult to cancel at all.</p>

<p>I'm not specifically recommending or discouraging any of those practices (except probably the last one - I don't really think that's ever good for the long-term goals of the business). But does show that free trials aren't necessarily a total loss even when the customer doesn't continue the service long term.</p>

<p>If you think of this as a marketing expense, then you have to consider if your marketing budget (assuming you have one) is best spent on free trials or on whatever else you were planning to spend it on. That will probably depend on your specific service and what it is you were planning to spend the rest of your marketing budget on. Keep in mind though that a free trial won't work as well by itself, you have to have some way of letting people know you exist so they can come and try your free trial.</p>

<p>If you want to offer a free trial but you don't have enough of a marketing budget to go around, you could do a limited free trial offer where it is not open to everyone.</p>

<p>You could make the offer available to a specific subset of those you're marketing to (i.e. offer members of a specific site a link to the free trial).</p>

<p>You could make people apply to the free trial. This isn't as convenient for the customer, but it can be a way for you to make sure people are serious about trying it out before you give them free access.  When I logged into my Amazon Web Services account the other day, I had an offer from a company to let me use their automated backup services free for 6 months.  It was a pretty sizable offer actually if I was in a position to use it to the full extent of its capabilities. But when I went to check it you, there was an application process to get the offer. I didn't apply because I'm not in a position to fully utilize it. But to them that really doesn't mean they lost a customer, it means they lost a free trial member that probably would have cost them more than I would've been worth.  They probably lose at least some people that would've been longterm paying customers too, but it allowed them to make a very generous offer and still limit it to those that are most likely to become long-term customers.</p>

<p>You could limit it to X number of free trials per day/week/month/lunar cycle/whatever.  Something along the lines of: ""Our first 150 users this month are eligible for a free trial! Only 48 left, sign up now to claim your spot!""</p>

<p>Which of these options (or something different) works best for your business is something only you can answer based on your specific business model and financial standing.</p>

","<p>Your thoughts are incorrect. An LLC is a separate legal entity. It is reported on Sch C ""as if"" it were a proprietorship purely due to IRS regulations. By law (all US states) it is a separate entity. It is separate whether it has 1 member or 1000. More than 1 member requires filing a Form 1065 return. Once the IRS issues an Employer Identification Number (EIN) you are required to keep it. It may not be changed without the IRS's permission.</p>

<p>Note that the due date for the filling of the LLC on a Form 1065 (typically called a Partnership return)for the 2015 returns is the same as that of an individual, April 15.

"How can I automatically accept monthly payments by credit card, via a website?","333","","<p>I'm looking to set up a service that has a flat monthly fee. How can I set up my website to allow users to input a credit card that then automatically gets billed monthly, with minimal human intervention?</p>

<p>As I understand it, QuickBooks does what I want, kind of. But that requires human intervention (practically speaking, at least). It'll be relatively low-volume, so I <em>could</em> theoretically just accept credit card information and manually via a regular <code>TextBox</code>, then feed myself an alert to copy that into QuickBooks (or equivalent) every time someone signs up. But that seems like it could become cumbersome pretty quickly, not to mention nothing would be validated (beyond the unimpressive checksums you can find online) until I had gotten around to typing it up.</p>

<p>I suppose I could write a web-job or something, perhaps, to run in the background and bill people monthly, if an ecommerce plug-in had a code-only API available. But that just seems like it would be more trouble than it should be.</p>

<p>What determines entrepreneurial success?</p>

<p><em>What is entrepreneurial success?</em></p>

<p>As noted by <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1050/1141"">@daOnlyBG</a>, in the context of this question, I'll offer a broad definition of success. I understand there may be other definitions of success which will produce different answers. I realize my definition of success may be naive, but a definition is in order. Let's define entrepreneurial success as (1) firm survival, (2) firm revenue growth, and (3) firm employment growth.</p>

<p><em>What kind of answer do I expect?</em></p>

<p>There are plenty of opinions on what makes start-ups successful. These opinions are found in popular press business books, online, TV, radio, magazines, etc... I am <strong>not</strong> looking for another opinion. I am looking for <strong>data</strong>. By data I mean, <strong>academic research published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal or an academic book by a team of professors from a reputable, accredited university</strong>. The accepted answer should have a description of the factors that make a start-up successful along with a link to the original academic study, following my example. Additionally, avoid creating a new answer. Instead, add to the most comprehensive answer below. </p>

"How to pay freelancers for software development?","318","","<p>I'm starting a new software developer start up. With our increasing demand, we have a need to hire some freelancers. But I don't know how to calculate the proper payment for each group of tasks. What is the best way to do it?</p>

<p>For our company we're using Scrum.</p>

<p>I just want a methodology do calculate how much a task is worth for. Not take it out from my head. </p>

<p>for instance: X USD per hour.  X USD per story point.  X USD per task.... what is a good practice for hiring a freelancer?</p>
","<p>I am working in an IT Company and this is how I see it...
In order to create a payment plan, we must determine how long it will take to complete the Website/Software product. However, this is not a straight forward task, especially when the product has to be developed custom (without using any CMS or a Template system). </p>

<p>Also, before finalizing the pricing model you must consider its effects on the product under development. The more flexibility you keep it for yourself, more room will be there to add new functionality which might not have been part of the original plan but now necessary for the Product. </p>

<p><strong>Pricing Models:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Fixed Price:</em> Both parties agree on a fixed project scope, fixed duration and a fixed budget. I believe the fixed price model is best to apply where the tasks are straight forward and scope is defined. For jobs like debugging, fixing errors, etc. where it’s difficult to estimate the time spent, I do not recommend it. As, here the developer is bounded by a fixed price and a set duration (deadline) and it’s quite possible that developer will take the shortcuts or deliver the poor quality work if S/he feels that these fixes are taking longer than S/he expected. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Hourly:</em> In this model the client is billed for the actual number of hours spent on the project. If there are additional requests – you pay more, if something is done more quickly – you pay less. Also, Freelancers don’t have any risk of being paid less in-case project scope increases which is more obvious in a fixed price model where both parties agree on a cost.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hybrid Pricing:</em> Well, this is a mix of both hourly and fixed. It gives you an idea of the expected cost before starting the project. Here the work is scoped upfront same manner as in the Fixed Price model, but in terms of total number of hours and then an expected cost is given. Total Cost = The Number of hours estimated multiplied by the cost per hour. For example, let’s say a project is estimated to take 1000 hours and per hour cost is $30, that means the cost comes to $30,000. Now, we set a total project cost say $30,000 but work on Hourly basis tracking the number of hours. When the project ends, the client get an idea of the actual hours spent and pay accordingly. Considering the same example of 1000 hours work… Suppose it actually took 900 hours rather than expected 1000 hours. The client will only pay $27,000 not $30000 which he should have if it was on fixed price model. But if work tends to take more than 1000 hours, then the client will only pay the set amount of $30,000 (like the fixed price model) not the over billed hours.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>P.S.: This is our internal process and I'm not sure about how others follow this or agree to it.</p>

<p><strong><em>However, in all three cases the project must be divided into modules/milestones with a set delivery duration to measure the progress and stay organized.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Practice to be followed while hiring a freelancer:</strong></p>

<p>Create a detailed project scope > Communicate with the Freelancer to make sure that S/he understands the scope > Check the Portfolio of work relevant to your needs > Agree on a cost and Set reasonable schedule/deadline > Start with a test task > Review the work and share the feedback. </p>

<p>Start with the bigger project if you are satisfied with the test task > Agree on a Communication Channel > Set a daily/weekly tasks review schedule > Use Project Management Tool to collaborate on the tasks > Test the build > Get a documentation > Get the code and other assets > The project is done.       </p>

<p>Also, it’s a good practice to hire a dedicated resource who can devote full time on your project is a better option over hiring multiple resources for short duration as every one of them will write the code in their own way and it will be create problems for the next person to understand the code. </p>

"Launching 2nd SaaS product, should I re-incorporate?","316","","<p>I've launched my first SaaS product 4 years ago as LLC in Illinois. I didn't know much back then about incorporating correctly.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've clearly heard that everyone is recommending that a corporation is started in Delaware as a C-corp, if one is hoping to eventually bring on investors and/or sell the business, I'm now considering this before launching my 2nd SaaS product.</p>

<p>So far, I've been financing development of the 2nd SaaS product from revenues of the first by the IL LLC.  I would prefer to keep finances for both products together (don't want to maintain 2 bank accounts, Quickbooks subscriptions, Authorize.net subscriptions, and bunch of other subscriptions and services that can be shared across multiple products), if possible.</p>

<p>So, if I keep finances together an in the original LLC, does it even make sense to start a Delaware C-corp that only ""owns"" the product?  Is it even legal?</p>

<p>If I don't start an DE C-Corp right now, and say some years from now someone wants to buy my 2nd product, can I easily incorporate a DE C-Corp and transfer the product to it?  </p>

<p>I'm a solo founder and own 100% of my company and products.</p>
","<p>Doing what you've clearly heard people recommend and doing the right thing are too unrelated things.</p>

<p>There's no necessity whatsoever to open a DE C-Corp if you intend to later sell your company. You can transfer ownership of the LLC just as well, or reincorporate <em>then</em> if required.</p>

<p>Since you already commingled two products, I <em>personally</em> see no reason why not to keep the second product under the same roof.</p>

<p>When the time comes to sell - you'll have to talk to an attorney and a tax adviser about how to properly separate them, and whether an additional entity is needed. But you don't <em>have to</em> go through the process ahead of time.</p>

<p>If you do <em>want to</em> - you'll need to talk to a lawyer and a tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State) on how to properly do that.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that using C-Corp means double taxation and mandatory payroll expenses, so you really need to think twice if you want to listen to all the talking heads on the Internet when it is your money on the line.</p>

"Founders decided to switch my position from employee to partnership","310","","<p>It's been 3 months since I joined this startup. Upon joining, we became a team of 5 people, 3 co-founders, 2 employees. Our compensation was based on equity, and the promise of a salary upon launching our business. </p>

<p>Going forward 3 months, the other employee bailed, 1 co-founder decides to leave, and we're left with 2 co-founders and myself. During the last meeting, I learnt that their initial promise of getting a salary upon launching is no longer feasible, so instead they decided to bump my equity, and also wanted to break to employee/employer relationship to a <strong>partnership</strong> instead. We currently have no investors, though the co-founders found a lead on 1. In the near future, we're to dispose of the previous employer-employee agreement and sign a partnership instead.</p>

<p>Are there any inherent dangers I should be cautious of? </p>
","<p>Well, yes. If you're a partner, you usually fall under the management agreements, which basically means you get a management fee and dito rights. If the company goes bankrupt (I'd say there's a good chance given what you describe), you'll also be helt resposibly. If on the other hand it will take off or get sold, you'll get money based on equity, which is better.</p>

<p>In most countries there are things like mismanagement and personal liability. Assuming there's no fraud (etc), all of these have to do with the financial balance of the company. Basically you cannot take more than you can chew on.</p>

<p>Given that you ask this question means to me that you don't understand these rules regarding legal responsibilities of companies. For this reason alone, I'd strongly recommend against taking the offer, or seriously reading up on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the last meeting, I learnt that their initial promise of getting a salary upon launching is no longer feasible [...]</p>

"What hours can I expect of my employees?","309","","<p>Small businesses, and tech startups in particular, are notorious for the hours expected of founders and employees. Developers in particular are often expected to do <em>whatever it takes</em> to hit a launch date. But then on the other hand, developers are also known for keeping hours that others might consider ""unusual.""</p>

<p>From what I've seen of the world, I get the impression that the classic 9-5 day job is starting to be a thing of the past, with more and more companies starting to offer full dinner services on-location.</p>

<p>As a small business owner, what hours can I reasonably expect of employees? And on top of that, what sort of structure should those hours be enforced with? </p>

<p>I wouldn't want to be too strict about it, of course, but these are the options I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expect employees to be at work from X:00 am to Y:00 pm.</li>
<li>Expect employees to be at work for X number of hours per day or week, but I don't care whether they want to come in at 6:00 am or 1:00 pm as long as they hit that quota and don't miss meetings.</li>
<li>Allow employees to pick whatever hours they want, as long as they produce good work and attend whatever meetings we may have--if that means they can work from home a few days a week, that's fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't really expect a magic combination, but what pros and cons are there to each structure? Perhaps different jobs have different ideals?</p>
","<p>You're focusing on the wrong thing, the right question is how do you hire great motivated people and convince them to work for you a long time. Management tactics where you put strict rules in place tend to drive away top people, especially in technology, meaning you'll just turn the screws on the people that can't find something better.</p>

<p>Figure out how to find the best people, then make it as easy as possible for them to work no matter where they are without requiring they do so. Fire anyone who doesn't meet expectations. If you set the standard high, don't surround good people with bad (and punish them with crazy hours/requirements/etc because of the bad people), and make work enjoyable you'll have a lot more success than if you tightly control everything.</p>

"Can a startup at its 2nd year have a remote CTO?","308","","<p>I have been researching and I thought I would try to spark a conversation here about this topic: <strong>Startup with Remote CTO</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is the story:</p>

<p>======================================================</p>

<p>There is a B2B company which has been providing services for a year and has been, in the last few months, focusing on adding technology to their offering. The plan is to put more and more energy and efforts into the tech, turning the company into a tech company first.</p>

<p>The company has a steady amount of revenues from the services and is soon going to start a beta program with some customers for the tech part (a SAAS platform). </p>

<p>The CEO has worked alone in the first year, while the CTO took care of all the tech and turned the idea into reality, becoming co-founder at the 1st-year ""birthday"" of the company.</p>

<p>Now, the CTO believes they can work remotely (from another continent). The CTO also thinks that by being in another region of the world the company would increase their presence by having face-to-face meetings with prospect clients in that region.</p>

<p>The CEO, on the other hand, doesn't believe it is possible to have a remote CTO and is thinking of either convincing the CTO to remain or to change their role to a <em>C-less</em> one (e.g. backend developer, software architect, etc.)</p>

<p>The CTO doesn't want that and by not being able to be remote (as it was previously discussed during the initial agreement) that would be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>======================================================</p>

<p>Is it possible? Would you have examples where one or more of the founding members went full-remote and it either worked or crashed?</p>
","<p>They're both kind of right. For context, we're 100% remote at Scrapinghub, and have over 100 employees. The management team is spread as far east as India and as far west as the US east coast. I'd say this much:</p>

<p>It's perfectly possible to have a remote CTO. In no way does it get in the way of productivity if you use the right tools and hire the right people (hint: autonomous). And it indeed allows to spread the number of time zones where you're able to do meetings with clients at sensible work hours.</p>

<p><em>But</em>, there also is something to be said about how being remote can get in the way of working <em>as a team</em> at sensible work hours. If the company's managers don't have 3-4 hours worth of slots per day where they can potentially meet one another in a Hangout, they'll end up needing to constantly work async - and <em>that</em> can make a serious dent in their respective productivity and in their teams' productivity. Likewise for the manager relationships with employees: a manager's team should have 3-4 hours worth of potential meeting slots each day. The less compatible time slots the entire team has, the more precious those time slots become. You need at least 3-4 hours worth of time per day where the entire team is online so they can interact with one another and streamline activities.</p>

<p>Put another way, try to avoid extreme time zone differences between people who need to regularly interact with one another. My own limit is a 6-7h time zone difference. I'm lucky to be based in Europe in this respect: my two teams are spread between India and the US east coast. I'd be <em>very</em> hard pressed to recruit anyone further east or west, because I'd be short on meeting slots to call up a quick 15min Hangout with all parties concerned should I need to quickly sort out whatever that day's fire might be. And I'd fully expect the managers who report to me to have everyone in their team be in time zones that are compatible with theirs as well (but not necessarily mine).</p>

<p>Aside: I've seen the damage that being too far away can do first hand. Picture dysfunctional decision making where two managers in barely compatible time zones aren't on the same page and give contradictory directions to an employee. It's even worse when that employee can't meet both managers together unless <em>someone</em> volunteers to book a meeting between 12am and 6am to gather all three stakeholders to put everyone on the same wavelength. Projects can drag on forever when that happens - or worse. From Europe, I'd think twice before accepting work from a client or an employer based in California or Australia - I'd relocate to somewhere closer if it's a long-term opportunity.</p>

"How to find all similar services or competition?","305","","<p>When I have an idea, I want to search similar service that already exist or competition. I try to google but it seems it's not efficiently to find all.(all service is not list on top google search result page or maybe it's on beta or search keyword issue)</p>

<p><strong>Is there any good way to find most of similar service or competition that already exist I want to try?</strong></p>
","<p>Four steps:</p>

<h3>1. Use keyword search</h3>

<p>This is to get starting points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phrase it as a ""how to solve..."" type of question that would reflect what your audience would search.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, phrase it as a ""solution for..."" type of query.</p></li>
<li><p>Phrase it as a description of your solution and try that too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Toss in the likes of ""forum"" or ""recommendation"" or ""best"" or ""best way"" into the queries, and you'll usually locate a few forum threads that debate the merits of existing options.</p>

<p>Be sure to get a feel of the types of pages you run into while doing your research, as they can give indications of what users are <em>actually</em> looking for when doing research. Note down and test other potential search phrases as you discover them.</p>

<h3>2. Use keyword research tools</h3>

<p>There are plenty. For instance, Google Keyword Planner.</p>

<p>At the very least, get a feel of whether the key search phrases you've come up with are entered often or not, and of the competition on these keywords to plan your SEO efforts.</p>

<p>If appropriate, dig a bit deeper to broaden the scope, as you might locate interesting variations of these search phrases or outright use cases that you've yet to encounter. Test them too.</p>

<p>Slap a big red flag on your idea if you've yet to come up with search phrases with reasonable traffic, or run into competition. It usually meets there's little demand for the solution, or that users aren't willing to pay for it.</p>

<h3>3. Use similar website tools</h3>

<p>There are plenty as well. For instance, Similar Web.</p>

<p>This may give you hints to further alternatives and competitors that you've yet to run into.</p>

<p>At this stage you should be building and fine-tuning persona, and trying to spot use-cases that you didn't think about yet for future sales arguments. Note them down.</p>

<h3>4. Ask end-users</h3>

<p>Don't skip this. Locate some users in each segment you've identified. Make phone calls and meet with end-users. Interview a half dozen users in each segment.</p>

<p>Introduce yourself as an entrepreneur who is seeking to validate an idea, and ask for a few minutes of their time for some quick questions. Avoid cold calling during hours when they're likely busy or in meetings.</p>

<p>Validate that the problem you're trying to solve is one that they actively have and are actively trying to solve. Ask them for pricing details if applicable. And ask what solutions they or their peers are currently using. (You might discover new, non-obvious competitors or use cases.)</p>

<p>Be on the lookout for very surprising or obvious answers at this stage because sometimes the elephant in the room is hidden in plain sight. For instance, if you're selling a point of sale solution for bars, the time they actually buy one is <em>when they open the bar</em> -- come later and they'll already have a solution in place, making your sales process harder and longer.</p>

","<p>Copyright is on an exact match.</p>

<p>In other words, if I held a copyright on that opening sentence and you rephrased it as ""copyright requires an exact match to infringe,"" that wouldn't infringe.</p>

<p>The fact that your image looks sorta like the stock one isn't really a concern. It could be considered bad form, but I don't think what you've done is too far at all. As Denis pointed out in a comment, ""a coin is a coin, gold color is gold color, 3d shadows effects are shadows."" I wouldn't take any particular notice to your artwork as being any different from any other.</p>

<p>The only way you could be considered infringing--probably--is if you had a copy-paste duplicate of that stock image used. It might also  count if you just took a small, distinguishable part, but I don't consider the shadowing you've taken to cross that line. I'm not a lawyer, and I'm definitely not a judge, so I can't really say for certain, but it looks fine to me.</p>

<p>Just for good measure, the <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-infringement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">United States Copyright Office says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...copyright law provides the owner of copyright in a work the exclusive right:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>To reproduce the work in copies;</li>
  <li>To prepare derivative works based upon the work;</li>
  <li>To distribute copies of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;</li>
  <li>To  perform the work publicly;</li>
  <li>To display the copyrighted work publicly</li>
  <li>In the case of sound recordings, to perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, it seems like the closest one you hit there is ""derivative work,"" which <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#derivative"" rel=""nofollow"">is defined as</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a “derivative work”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which doesn't seem to apply to your case.</p>

<p>The only type of intellectual property where ""fuzzy matching"" (not exact matches) really applies is in trademarks, since they're meant to protect consumers from thinking something is from one company, when it is in fact from another. But that person wouldn't have a trademark on that image, since it would have to be used in commerce (e.g. as a logo).</p>

<p>I'd be a bit tempted, if I were you, to swap around the shadow, just for the sake of differing it that much more, but it really shouldn't matter from a legal standpoint.</p>

<p>So, he gets disappointed and frustrated, and thus leaves the site. </p>

<p>So, for retaining customers in the site, the site needs to have activity. Users should feel nice, they should feel that activity.

"What is the most sucessful stealth launch in history?","300","","<p>Recently ran across an international business that is planning a massive parallel stealth launch in the US; in fact, I'll be amazed if their able to launch in stealth given the scale of what it appears they're planning. </p>

<p>Normally, I don't think very highly of stealth startups, and in fact, the company above is not a startup, but clearly there are real world examples of stealth startup launches that in fact played out in a way that worked in the end. </p>

<p><strong>What is the most successful stealth launch in history?</strong></p>

<p>By the ""most successful"" stealth launch in history, the measure would be the internal rate of return for the first 12 months following the launch - and that the facts supporting the claims made must come from a notable source.</p>
","<p>Stealth launches is hard to define. You can have a company operating in stealth mode on a product with little public information (Apple electric car, Segway) and then have a very public announcement when the product is ready. And you can have a stealth launch like how in 2002 Sony Ericsson released its camera phone by just having a group of their personnel show up in public places with camera phones asking passer bys to take pics with the phones and explaining the feature. The latter counts more on the uniqueness of the product that it would make people talk about it on their own and have a sort of viral launch campaign. </p>

<p>Sometimes stealth do not work out as they are intended. I think the biggest failure in recent history would be the Segway. The little cryptic information the public received was over hyped and created over expectations which the product failed to meet leading to a lot of disappointment from the onset. </p>

<p>Since return rates on campaigns are rarely published, it maybe be difficult to give an exact comparisons unless it was someone closely involved in it.</p>

"What is needed to qualify a company to bid on government contracts in the US?","295","","<p>For a newly established business that is looking to bid on US Government contracts:</p>

<ul>
<li>What paperwork needs to be filed?</li>
<li>Does it cost anything up-front?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This question specifically deals with the registration/qualification to bid on a contract, not the actual bid process.</p>
","<p>I became increasingly interested in this topic, and I thought how it could apply to my business, so I did some quick research. The majority of my response is directly from <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/become-qualified-bid-government-contracts-21738.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>, since it is written so incredibly well.</p>

<h1>Step 1</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online"" rel=""nofollow"">Register with the IRS</a> for an employer identification number. You can register for an EIN online at no cost and receive your EIN immediately. The EIN is sometimes referred to as a tax identification number, or TIN.</p>

<h1>Step 2</h1>

<p>Register with Dun and Bradstreet for a DUNS number. This is a unique business identification number widely used in commerce and required for bidding on federal contracts. Registration is by phone and is free. You will receive your DUNS number immediately (edit: user @connor had a bad experience with this. It may take longer). See also <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/grants/duns_num_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Whitehouse DUNS guide</a>.</p>

<h1>Step 3</h1>

<p>Visit the Central Contractor Registration website. Click ""Start New Registration"" to begin the registration process.</p>

<h1>Step 4</h1>

<p>Click ""Create a User Account"" and enter your identification information. Provide answers to five security questions (e.g., ""mother's maiden name"") and proceed to the next steps of the registration.</p>

<h1>Step 5</h1>

<p>Provide details of your business, including your EIN and DUNS numbers. You must also provide your NAICS industry classification code. If you do not know your NAICS code, you can find it using the online tools at the CCR website by entering keywords that describe your business. Click ""Validate/Save Data"" to save your information and complete the registration.</p>

<h1>Step 6</h1>

<p>Check for e-mail confirmation of your registration in three to five business days after completing the application. Once registered, you are eligible to bid on government contracts.</p>

<p>It seems to look pretty straightforward, and it looks to be very important since the government is one of the most active participants in private contracts (talking several hundreds of million dollar deals, annually).</p>

<p>Also see <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/content/federal-contracting-resources-small-businesses"" rel=""nofollow"">Small Business Admin</a></p>

<p>Again -- I'm assuming you meant on government contracts with the American government. My quick glance to answer your questions directly</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Applying is free, assuming you have the business credentials established.</p></li>
<li><p>The paperwork is listed in the steps</p></li>

"How Many Customer Interviews Do You Need?","287","","<p>When deciding how many customer interviews it will take to validate/disprove a single assumption within a value proposition hypothesis, how do you know when you've done enough? </p>

<p>Seems like there might be a number of factors such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The interviewers experience doing customer development</li>
<li>Existing familiarity with the customer needs and problems</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
","<p>You're right — the answer is ""it depends"".</p>

<p>The rule of thumb that has worked well for people in my experience is ""stop doing interviewing when you stop learning"". </p>

<p>As soon as you have two people you’ll likely start seeing some common themes emerging. Every person after that will add more. At some point you hit a point of diminishing returns for your current learning context.</p>

<p>I rarely find that I stop learning useful new things before I’ve talked to 5 or 6 people. I rarely find that I’m still learning useful new things after about 15 interviews (even if the thing learned is ""we don't have a decent market segment identified since everybody is giving us different answers"" ;-)</p>

<p>So if I was <em>forced</em> to pick a number I would say 10-12 people stands a fair chance of being useful.</p>

<p>I’m trying to encourage the folk I work with to move away from thinking of interviewing (and other custdev-ish things) as being one-time tasks. Instead approach them as continual task that you repeat to gather new insights, validate old ones, etc. Interviewing smaller groups more frequently, rather than a one-off batch at the start. With budget/time defined by the hypothesis we need de-risking — rather than an up-front guess on the number that will be ""right"".</p>

"How should a startup expand a web-app to another country?","287","","<p>Facebook began in Harvard, and then <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/3/1/facebook-expands-beyond-harvard-harvard-students/"" rel=""nofollow"">expanded to others universities</a>, step by step, this was a master move from M.Zuckerberg. </p>

<p>In this context of expansion of a web-app, if I begin in a ""X"" country and my startup (web-app like google, trello, instagram) is successful:</p>

<p>How can I expand to others countries, in the sense of being effective in my entrance to the foreign society?</p>

<p>I'm thinking of expanding to other countries because in the same country is easier to communicate an idea, i.e., local radio, local newspaper, local webpages, local persons networks, etc.</p>
","<p>Here's a general idea using the concept of generic <em>areas</em> as opposed to whole countries. But first, let's make some simple assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the areas use the same language</li>
<li>For each area you want to expand into, there will be a sizable number of people in your target market who know someone from an area that you are already active in</li>
<li>Your target markets in each of the areas generally have similar interests</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so given these, we can focus on actually getting your webapp out there:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to choose areas where there is already a visible amount of interest. If there are no areas with interest yet, perhaps you need to better market your product in the area you are already deployed in.</li>
<li>Prioritize deployment into new areas by interest level, target market size, and the ""connectedness"" of those new areas into areas where your product is already gaining traction.</li>
<li>Make your product available for free, with additional options or features available with a subscription. For instance:
<ul>
<li>Google Apps: free for individual users, paid plan allows businesses to manage all of their users and use their own domain. Paid plans also add additional features and space.</li>
<li>Trello: basic features are available for free, additional features and data management is available with their paid plans.</li>
<li>GitHub: free for all users, private repos cost $, enterprise deployments on their own infrastructure cost $$$.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See if you can get your expansion mentioned in a local news/blog/aggregator site. Alternatively, if you are adding multiple areas at a time, see if you can get mentioned in a large tech media site (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">TechCrunch</a>, <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Lifehacker</a>, etc.) or popular news aggreagators (really just <a href=""http://slashdot.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Slashdot</a> and <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hacker News</a>).</li>
<li>Consider just making your webapp available to all users everywhere from Day I. Whether this is a good idea or not depends on your actual app, but seriously think it through.</li>

"How do you formalise an IOU arrangement?","286","","<p>I've heard a few people talk about the benefits of issuing IOUs instead of shares when funding a startup. What does this actually look like? Is there a legal structure for doing this? How do IOUs work in the real world?</p>
","<p>There aren't too many basic options in funding, but there are lots of variants. From the perspective of a funder, here are the principal questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Who gets my money?</strong> It could be an individual, an existing company, or an intermediary en route to one of those (e.g. Kickstarter acts as a trusted intermediary)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What do I get?</strong> Leading choices are satisfaction for having helped, my money back (perhaps with interest), the first $X of any income, the right to buy shares in the future at some beneficial rate, voting shares, non-voting shares, the optional right to convert debt to shares</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What additional protections do I have?</strong> Perhaps if the venture fails, I own whatever's left</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What if it all goes wrong?</strong> For instance, a loan to a company disappears if the company ceases; a personal guarantee attached to that loan means that an individual has to make good</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'd usually understand an IOU to be a person-to-person promise to pay back money loaned. So in the above framework, I give you the money; I get that money back from you at some future point; there are no special privileges; and if the venture goes wrong, you still owe me the money.</p>

<p>However, in the startup world sometimes what's going on with IOU-type paper agreements is a decision to delay making decisions on how shares are going to work and who's in and who's out until the venture is underway. That could be a good route for a startup that's nobody's day-job, although it could be a problem downstream if by the time you're ready to formalise, the interests of different parties have gone in different directions.</p>

","<p>You have no idea if your MVP is going to achieve product-market fit until you launch it. You should <strong>always</strong> launch it first without worrying about scalability.

<li><p>Taxes: No matter where you are registered you will be filing some kind of taxes. When doing this remotely it's often difficult to know the certain laws in the area.

You can read more about that <a href=""http://www.myllc.com/which-state-to-form-llc.aspx"">here</a>. In addition, I would recommended hiring a book keeper and an accountant to help keep you on track for this. The book keeper will keep your books up to date. (A good one will be around $60/hour) The accountant will ensure your taxes are filed appropriately yearly and quarterly if needed. (A good one will be around $125/hour, the actual yearly filing will be around $400)</p></li>

"When you are doing breakeven analysis do you include VAT","281","","<p>In the UKdoes the break even include VAT or Not is it the total price of the item?</p>
","<p>Accounting has nothing to do with break even analysis (BEA). Therefore VAT has NO influence on BEA.</p>

<p>Lets say you your own price for your product is 1000€/a, the tax rate is 20%, so you collect 1200€/a. You also invested 4000€ to start your venture and you will have costs of 600€/a.</p>

<p>VAT is collected by your startup and transferred to treasury (I hope that is the right term and usage) within a certain time frame. So your earnings per year are increased by 200€ and reduced by 200€ again.</p>

<p>The BEA shows a time span, in which you have more money <strong>earned</strong> then spend for your venture. So only the earnings influence BEA.</p>

<p>Also there is a difference. VAT collection and calculation is a task/number which represents the past, while Break Even Analysis is a tool to predict the future. You try to keep prediction tools simple. Mostly they don't display reality, but they make different approaches comparable!</p>

<p>Let's do our simple example without VAT: (BEP = Break Even Point)</p>

<p>0 = -4000 + (1000 - 600) * BEP</p>

<p>It actually does. The advise it gives is to split 50/50 with both you and the other founder getting an IOU - you for the remaining 85% of your market salary, the other for 100% of their salary plus whatever capital they invest.</p>

<p>One month is nothing unless a) the founder massaged the idea around to the point where he lined up a first couple of clients before bringing you onboard, or b) he has so much money lying around and you such average skills that you're a replaceable cog, or c) you are naive and inexperienced enough to think that a month without you makes a great deal of difference.</p>

<p>If so then you're an employee. Bluntly, if the basis of your relationship is to let go of your salary in exchange for <em>maybe</em> stock, you'll end up with left overs, a few bones, and chump change. So stop leg-humping your boss. Get paid sensibly. And treat whatever stock you end up with as a bonus. Be happy with a few percent. Be super happy with 5% or more. But whatever you do, get paid - this is <em>bonus</em> money, not a salary replacement.</p>

<p>If not then you're a cofounder. You're taking the same risks - he's spending money he has a bit too much of, you're accepting to get underpaid for time you've way too little of. Reap the rewards of your work and get half. And for that matter, brace yourselves to have a third cofounder on equal terms as the two of you if needed in a month or three.</p>

"Market Research and Gauging Sales for Games","279","","<p>So on all the advice sites I see for developing a new product, I see ""Research your target market"" chiefly for predicting the number of sales you can expect.</p>

<p>Now this phrase to me just seems vague, I want to break into the board/card/miniatures games market, something which I myself buy a lot of. But what exactly is it that I'm meant to research to gauge my sales off.</p>

<p>I know from being a customer in this market, that it is expanding quite rapidly currently, lots of new games and systems are out, but I don't see how this helps me actually make a sales prediction, as even though I know the market is doing well, I don't know how my specific product will.</p>
","<p>In theory what you <em>should</em> be doing is digging out figures:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much did similar games sell?</li>
<li>To which audience?</li>
<li>At what price points?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, get an idea of <em>who</em> your audience might be, what percentage of it might buy your app, and how much money you stand to make.</p>

<p>Then again, the game industry is a bit weird. Look around you and virtually everyone has a game or more installed on their smartphone. Cohorts of children, adolescents, young adults, house moms, geek moms and dads, and retirees all crave games to some extent. And virtually all households have one or more physical games lying around -- this is your target market based on your comments.</p>

<p>You'll find that some games sell like hotcakes while other very similar ones do not sell at all. See for instance recent German style boardgames, e.g. Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne vs more obscure ones that never took off. Or in the past, the likes of Warhammer or Bloodbowl vs the variations of the former that TSR tried to market at one point -- it was so bad I can't even remember the name even though I actually bought it.</p>

<p>It can look random at first glance. It isn't -- it depends on the user experience, on the promotion, and on whether the game gets prizes or not. Better a mediocre game that you promote left, right, and center than a great one that gets no press at all. And keep in mind that press and users react better to a mediocre game that looks and plays great than to a great game that looks and plays like crap (read: super complex rules).</p>

<p>Try this: recruit beta testers in your area. Try game stores, game clubs, etc. Collect feedback and monitor engagement levels. Iterate until the playability is good. Then launch and (prepare this in advance based on your findings) reach out to the press, forums, bloggers, and what have you -- get mentions and reviews.</p>

<p>As to how to do market research, the short version is ask questions. Literally interview shop owners, players in your area, ask around in game forums, etc. Get a feel of what they're buying, why, how, where, etc. Contrary to what your feelings may be suggesting you, store owners and players will happily give away just about as much information as you want or need if it's in private and if you're upfront about the fact that your questions stem from a market study to get a feel of how to sell your game and to who -- as board game fans they'll probably be enthusiastic to help you out. In the process you'll almost certainly find a store owner or two who will introduce you to publishers and what have you.</p>

<p>For sales <em>projections</em> the short version is that, like with any startup, it's an educated guess at best. Look, let's be blunt here: it's a very rare startup founder that gets it precisely right. Some under-estimate, most over-estimate. You'll determine that this or that game sold this or that amount in this and that area. Literally guess how much you'll sell based on where your own product stands compare to them, put that on paper, and basically call it a day. After a year you'll know where you stand and base your predictions on trends and historical data. Until then, take it for what it is in your financial planning: a wishful guess.</p>

<p>When it comes to your projected sales, the most you'll need to answer to and justify is: ""How do you plan to get those sales?"" The answer to that lies in how well you did your market study: ""Well, this game sold X at $Y and that one did roughly the same. We looked into how they launched and promoted their game, as well as into how good the media reception was. This other one did much worse, and that other one did much better, and we analyzed those too. Based on the data we've collected, we hope to do things like this and that because our audience is like so and so, and hangs out here and there."" If you're able to tell something like that to a game publisher, they'll be very impressed -- because most game authors are, I'd imagine, very much like book authors, and have absolutely no idea who their book will cater to.</p>

<h2> <strong>EACH VC FIRM,ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA,HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF WHAT A SEED ROUND IS.</strong></h2>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.cooleygo.com/difference-friends-family-seed-series-financings/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MIGUEL VEGA from Cooleygo ""The definition of a seed investment will vary somewhat depending on whom you ask.""</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The definition of a seed investment will vary somewhat depending on
  whom you ask. It would not be unusual for someone to refer to a larger
  friends and family financing as a seed financing. However, the term
  seed financing usually denotes a company’s first round of financing
  from third party investors who regularly invest in startup companies.
  These investors are typically individual angel investors, formal angel
  organizations or even venture capital funds. Seed investments are
  usually made through a mix of equity and loans, or sometimes
  convertible loan notes (often with a cap on the conversion value – see
  also The (Troublesome) Convertible Note Cap), simplified (short form)
  “series seed” financing documents or (often if led by a VC) “full”
  Series A style investment documents (see below). The structure
  selected for the investment will depend on investor preference and the
  availability of tax incentives, and will be influenced by the amount
  raised. As a general matter it is fair to say that the larger the
  amount raised, the more likely that the investors will use more formal
  and detailed investment documents.
  Subject to the caveats above, investment amounts under USD/EUR 1,000,000 or so > will often use convertible notes or Series Seed investment documentation.</p>

<li>This is true. The Y-Combinator in itself gets a pretty decent stake in your company (I have no idea if their portion of equity is dilutable, I would assume not) for tremendous resources at your disposal to help you succeed.Because of their proven track record, they essential give startups seed money , but receive a <em>series a</em> equity stake in terms of the valuation of the company (not 20%+ like series A) and I think it justified because of how good their reputation is. With that being said all startups have different needs and other incubators out there exist as well.

"If I'm working at a startup, do they have intellectual property rights to the stuff I do in my spare time?","278","","<p>With so many developers working on side projects and participating in events like hack-a-thons what happens to the IP of the things they build on their own time? Can I take my side project and launch a company based on it as a startup later?</p>
","<p>This is not a simple cut and dry situation.   Some factors to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you have a contract? If so, does it specify their rights and ownership?<br>
Even though it might not be enforceable, it at least sets the tone for what
they feel they have a right too.  Most companies will provide you with a process
to list your side projects and work so that they are clearly aware of what you are
working on.  You don't have to disclose details, but you should list something 
along the lines of ""A mobile RPG game that is cross platform""</li>
<li>Are you using ANY of their resources.  This isn't just equipment and time, but it
access to intellectual property, partnerships with other companies, etc</li>
<li>There is a balance between the skills you brought to the table and the things you
learned on the job.  Especially if they paid for you to get training. </li>
<li>Sometimes it just comes down to where you live.  Different states and countries 
come down on this issue differently.  Some are very much pro-employee and some are
very pro-employer. </li>
<li>Despite what they may or may not have legal authority to claim ownership too, what 
are they willing to do about it? It may be completely obvious that they have no 
claim, but they may pursue simply to punish you.  On the other side, they may have
a clear case of ownership but they may not be interested in pursuing it simply because
their focus is on their business not yours.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, I've found it good to be transparent and up front with your employer.  If you're working for someone who has an issue with a side project, you have to wonder how they are going to treat you when it comes to discussing equity, profit sharing, etc.
A lot of times it's just a matter of expectation management.  If you surprise your boss one day by saying you're quitting to pursue your own project they might pursue ownership simply to maintain control of you and your time.</p>

We do have a registered LLC to manage ownership, but it's still at the stage where it's more of a side project and we're not ready to invest heavily.</p>

<p>When registering for various services, we've had to provide a phone number. So far we've just used one of our personal numbers. We don't need to talk to customers over the phone, but would it be a good idea to invest in an official company phone line for these situations?</p>

<p>If it is necessary, are there any cheaper alternatives to a landline or cell?</p>
","<p>I think for this small business scenario there is probably no need for getting an additional (more costly) business phone line. It's sufficient to sign up for some cheap or even free phone number that redirects to your phone(s).</p>

<p>One provider is Google Voice that currently offers free phone numbers for the United States (instructions: <a href=""https://support.google.com/voice/answer/150640?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/voice/answer/150640?hl=en</a>).</p>

<p>I signed up for one of those numbers and set it up to redirect to my mobile phone during business hours. It's a solid service that you can even use as a ""concierge"". People can leave behind a message that gets automatically translated into a text message that is sent to you by email. So, I don't think you really need an additional business phone line for that, just a number that redirects to (both) your phone(s).</p>

<p>The only downside is that Google has a history of being quite flaky with their services. They have no problem with ditching anything that doesn't suit their business, so this service may be cancelled by them at any time and you may have to find a new number from a different provider and print new business cards again.</p>

"Using Venmo for payment between small startups","274","","<p>In a situation where one startup is performing work for another, is it a good idea to use Venmo for the transaction? The founders would use their personal accounts and then withdraw/deposit money with the business bank account.</p>

<p>This seems like an easy solution for online payments that aren't recurring. The advantages are the lack of fees and not having to meet in person or mail a check. Are there any disadvantages beyond the slight hassle transferring money between business and personal accounts? I don't think this would be a long term solution anyway.</p>
","<p>You should <strong>not</strong> mix personal and business accounts.</p>

<p>First, it makes your taxes more complicated especially if you are ever audited.  In audit, the IRS will be going over your accounts with a fine toothed comb so best to keep your personal accounts out of it.</p>

<p>Second, you can lose the limited liability protections provided by your company.  One of the benefits of having a company is that the owners' personal assets are not in danger when the company is sued.  If someone sues your company for $1 billion, then your company goes bankrupt but you get to keep your house.  If you are mixing accounts, then you might lose your house too.</p>

<p>It looks like Venmo doesn't yet have business accounts, so you should mail a check or use a PayPal (or some alternative) business account and just pay the processing fees.</p>

"Dealing with an employee that is taking a free ride","273","","<p>I'm the founder of a small tech startup with limited private investment, I hired 4 skilled staff to build our first product.</p>

<p>Each member has a profit share agreement in our first product on release, maturity of this agreement requires staying with the company for some time after release of the product.</p>

<p>One of the employees who has a significant share, treats the project like a cruisy 9-5, takes regular days off to look after kids and averages ~ 3 sick days a month (without any current chronic illness).</p>

<p>I feel like it is generally accepted that a startup requires a different mentality to working for an established company. This however is much harder to express in writing, or definitively argue that their efforts are not up to scratch given the situation.</p>

<p>How should I approach the problem without turning the person in question hostile?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To clarify my description of the work ethic was not specifically related to hours, but more an attitude of not being invested in the outcome of work and more the process of sitting at a desk. </p>

<p>I don't expect people to work more than normal hours, our hours are completely flexible. The problem is when that freedom allows everything else in their life to take priority over work. </p>

<p>Like get to work at 11:15 late for meeting</p>

<p>Go to lunch at 12</p>

<p>Leaves at 4:30 to pickup kids sheepishly</p>

<p>Comes to work next day half asleep and works long hours to make up day before, isn't productive because of lack of sleep from freelance job worked late on.</p>

<p>This combined with frequent days off reduce the actual work output to much lower than I expect.</p>

<p>The pattern is this person is spreading themselves too thin to have energy left for much work at all. The productive number of hours cap in a day can be consumed by non work related things too, I fear too many are being consumed on other things to output a decent amount of work.</p>
","<p>In my experience, one of the biggest difficulties to overcome in any sort of business, and particularly those in startup stage, is <strong>communication.</strong> Make sure everyone is on the same page about what's expected.</p>

<p>Some people just aren't used to working 24/7, which is pretty understandable, and it isn't a malicious move when they avoid it, it just doesn't occur to them that that might be what's expected.</p>

<p>So talk with your team, as a whole. Don't call the person out, but just talk about how many hours you need to put in to get to launch by your target, and how much of that can be done from home versus how much needs to be done at your place of business.</p>

<p>On top of that, and as a developer with a reputation for being fairly efficient I consider this one really important, talk about what work you want to get done. Don't focus on how it's getting done, just make sure it <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>Is this employee putting in two-hour days and getting done what everyone else gets done when they work all day? If not, focus on <em>that</em>. It's hard to materialize time spent on something, but it's really easy to look at a list of to-do items and see that someone is underperforming.</p>

<p>Once you have that tangible evidence, again, bring it up as a group. Talk to the group about what you need to get done and when, and make sure responsibilities are very clearly laid out for each person. If this employee continues on and meets the goals, then is there a problem? Focus on that (for example, ""they're missing meetings"" might be a problem that's still around). If the person doesn't meet goals, then talk to them about that specifically.</p>

<p>Don't focus on how the work is getting done, focus on <em>that</em> it's getting done. Then the conversation is a lot easier to form.</p>

<p>If they get hostile when you point out in a polite way that they aren't getting as much work done as you need to launch, then it might be time to question whether they're bringing as much to the team as you need them to.</p>

"Absolutely Startup Newbie, software engineer, have product/idea, how to get it to market","272","","<p>Quick introduction: I am a full-time Software Engineer, have a CS Degree, and also limited hobbyist experience with digital electronics and hardware.</p>

<p>I have a question that might be too broad, so I apologize if that is the case. I thought this could be the right forum since this is about startups, and my question is related to getting a product to market:</p>

<p><strong>I have a promising product idea for a smartphone gadget, I know sufficient programming and electronics to even develop a prototype myself, but I know NOTHING about business and the steps needed to take a product to market.

<p>Let's say that I build a working prototype myself at home and don't tell anyone. What now? Can I go ahead and register a business name, then start selling it online (create a product website, sell on eBay, Amazon)? What if I don't register the idea under any patent? Will someone come up 1 or 2 months later with the same product/idea and sue me? (Somehow I believe this is not the way to go, but you could clarify why).</p>

<p>Let's say that I want to go into more of a formal startup route. How can I get 'business' people on board and where can I find them? How can I guarantee they will not sell my idea to someone else? Is it possible for a person like me that is not connected at all to go into this route? I'm an avid reader, what literature do you recommend me?</p>

<p><strong>In short, I want to answer the question: How do I get my product/idea to market, safely, legally, in the shortest amount of time, considering that I know NOTHING about the business/startup world.</strong></p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>How can I instruct myself about this in order to take the right steps?</p>

<p>First, read. There are many books on startups, business plans, marketing, and so on. For example, check out this <a href=""http://www.hello-startup.net/resources/recommended-reading/"" rel=""nofollow"">startup reading list</a>, which has many recommended books broken down by category (e.g., ideas, validation, marketing, code, hiring, etc). Second, find people to work with. If you're a programmer, then finding a co-founder with sales/marketing experience would be ideal. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I go ahead and register a business name, then start selling it online (create a product website, sell on eBay, Amazon)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. There are quite a few steps to creating a business, so check out the Legal and Financial sections of the <a href=""http://www.atomic-squirrel.net/startup-checklist/"" rel=""nofollow"">Startup Checklist</a> so you're familiar with what you have to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if I don't register the idea under any patent? Will someone come up 1 or 2 months later with the same product/idea and sue me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you demonstrated the idea in public before someone else filed a patent, their patent will not be valid. Moreover, you get basic copyright and trademark protections by default. For more info, check out <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0538466464"" rel=""nofollow"">The Entrepreneur's Guide to Business Law</a> and consult a lawyer (IANAL).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I get 'business' people on board and where can I find them?</p>

<p>Finding co-founders is hard, but essential to success (see <a href=""http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/05/07/guide-to-hiring-for-your-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">A Guide to Hiring for your Startup</a>). You're going to spend a LOT of time with them (if you're lucky enough to build a successful startup, <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/taking-the-plunge"" rel=""nofollow"">it'll take, on average, a decade</a>) and rely on them for a lot of work, so you need someone you can trust. Usually, your best bet is former co-workers and classmates, as you've completed projects with them before, and know you can rely on them. Your second best bet is friends. If you can't find anyone in those groups, you'll have to seek people externally, preferably in communities relevant to your product idea. For example, if you're building a mobile game, start spending time at mobile game events, conferences, online forums, and so on. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I guarantee they will not sell my idea to someone else? </p>

"The best way to build a team for my startup?","271","","<p>Whenever I read about successful people who accomplished a lot with their business, it's never been alone.</p>

<p>So now, I need to build a team for my startup.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I go about doing that? <br />
Do I go to events? <br />
Post online? <br />
What has been a proven way of assembling a team?</p>
","<p>There is a difference between a hired team and a cofounder. A cofounder/partners are more interested in the idea and may have more buy in than employees. </p>

<p>There are many sites online that can help you find cofounders or people who are interested in working with startups such as startuply and cofounderslab. However, more commonly people start with people they already know. They can be school mates (Bill Gates and Paul Allen), college buddies (Larry and Sergei), coworkers, family (Disney brothers),  friends (Jobs and Wozniak) etc. The advantage is that </p>

<ul>
<li>You already know the personality of the person and can get along with him</li>
<li>You know if their work ethic matches yours</li>
<li>They would be more willing to stick it out and have more buy in. Remember that employees are in it for the wages and investors are in it for their investments. You would want someone who wouldn't complain about rough patches. </li>
<li>Starting up is a very stressful thing. It helps if the person is someone you can trust and be frank and honest with. </li>
</ul>

<p>Look in your current circle if there are people with the kind of skills you need for the enterprise. If you do not know someone, try expanding your circle. Go to meetups in your area, reconnect with your friends from college etc. </p>

<p>It is not entirely true that you need to have a cofounder/partner/friend with you to do a successful startup. Dell, Steve Ells, Jeff Bezos,Fred Smith and John Delorean were all solo and worked on the idea by themselves and then hired the people they needed. </p>

<p>Don't spend too much time looking for the right people to partner with. If you start working on the idea and start building it, you may draw people who are interested in it to you and you may meet the your cofounder that way. Even if you don't, don't worry as there are plenty of successful  entrepreneurs who were solo acts. </p>

"Are Legal Documents Public Domain","269","","<p>Is is OK to take the terms of service from a website and just change the details, such as names? This might not be advisable, but it seems like a nice shortcut to save some initial legal fees.</p>

<p>In other words, are terms of service and other legal documents public domain?</p>
","<p>No, unless stated otherwise, they are not public domain. You could probably get away with copying one and modifying it though. They include a lot of boiler plate legalese and not many people read them anyway. Myspace <a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/shrinkwrap-licenses-an-epidemic-of-lawsuits-waiting-to-happen/d/d-id/1051535?page_number=2"" rel=""nofollow"">supposedly</a> used a copied terms of service for several years. </p>

<p>Your terms of service should be tailored to the service you offer though. Changing 'Google' to 'My Company' on the gmail terms of service probably wouldn't leave you with something that made much sense for your project. </p>

<p>If you're serious about the legal usage of your product (it doesn't sound like you are) and you can afford a lawyer, you should definitely work with one to make sure the terms fit your needs. If you want to do it yourself, a simple google search for terms of service templates will give you plenty of options that won't require you to start from scratch. There are also <a href=""https://www.rocketlawyer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">companies</a> to help you create legal documents without a lawyer.</p>

<p>If you do really want to copy a site's terms of service, there are some sites that publish theirs under a copyleft license, like <a href=""http://en.wordpress.com/tos/"" rel=""nofollow"">wordpress</a>. To be safe, use one of those, modify it as needed and cite it appropriately.</p>

<li>Simply, you will not be rich being a software engineer only... It's true!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if this right what do you advise?!
If not, what to do to renew my passion ?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
","<p>I would imagine that most answers to your question will be subjective as I don't believe there is a sure-fire formula to answer it. Everyone's circumstances are different and all that I can offer is my own personal anecdote, for what it's worth. <strong><em>Feel free to use it as inspiration or as a cautionary tale.</em></strong></p>

<p>At 31, I found myself in the same dilemma at the 10-year mark in <em>my</em> software development career. I worked for most of my career, up until that point, at a <em>mid-sized</em> consulting company, located in a <em>mid-sized</em> town, as a <em>mid-level</em> ""Senior"" Software Engineer. I felt like all I did was create the same <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRUD</a> applications day after day and, somewhere along the way, I lost my passion for development.  I started to force myself to tinker with newer and newer technologies in my spare time and worked on my own small projects trying to rekindle the passion that I once had. But no matter how much I tried, nothing could bring it back. </p>

<p>Like you, I thought that my issue was the type of company that I worked for and the type of work that I was doing. I also thought that it would be difficult (where I was located) to get in with top-tier companies and work on newer technologies and ""cooler"" projects.  I toyed with the idea of giving up development entirely and taking the management positions that I was offered, but for me, I felt like I would have died a little inside everyday with a life in middle-management.</p>

<p>Eventually, I quit my job, sold everything that we owned, and moved my wife and I to Silicon Valley, California. I got in with some very interesting companies (start-ups and enterprise-level) working on some ""cool"" products and made very good money (IMO). I had the opportunity to work with a lot of new technologies and advanced my skills quite a bit. Strangely, after a few years, I started to feel unsatisfied and dispassionate again. I eventually realized that for me <em>personally</em> I needed to either work on <em>my projects</em> where I controlled my own destiny (and with an opportunity for a bigger up-side) or get out of the game.  For family reasons, we had to move back to my home state and I worked remotely for my last California company while I saved up enough to fund my own. </p>

<p>About a year ago, at age 41, I quit my job yet again and started my own software company. I now make just enough money to comfortably survive. I'm not rich and it's a <em>long-shot</em>, but <em>damn</em> I look forward to going to work the next day! I haven't felt that way since the first years of my career and I still code every day.</p>

<p>For me, I solved the first issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...tiny chance you can a job in cool company, and you are
  going to end up building database business system, which I really get
  bored of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I'm currently working to solve the second:</p>

<p>Or perhaps you've seen a good speaker user a powerpoint presentation - often these are done poorly (i.e.  it's simply text that says the same thing the presenter is saying and adds no value... other than to help the presenter remember where he is in his speech), but if you've seen someone do it well, again, you'll have seen how this can be leveraged (if you haven't, go watch videos of some of the big tech announcements and see how they use slides in their presentations then think - ""What did they do well, and how can I apply it to pitching my startup?"").</p>

<p>Some of the key points and graphics you'll want in a pitch deck will cover: </p>

Does anyone know any such sites, or at least know how to search for them?</p>
","<p>If you ever seen a website where at the middle of the page they had a big banner saying: ""As seen on: The NY Times, Mashable, CNN, etc, etc."", the chances are that those are all feature articles. Every big news website does feature articles it only depends on the PR skills you have.</p>

<p>One technique you could use is the <strong>AirBnB trick</strong>, where they essentially started writing local news sites asking them to write a feature article about them. Small websites will be happy to do this since they need the content. Have enough small websites feature you and start emailing the bigger ones. </p>

<p>The thing is, that if you can <strong>tell your story in a very compelling way</strong>, then you might even be lucky enough to be contacted by these bigger news sites. Big news sites monitor smaller ones and eachother, and if they pick up on a story that gets featured on multiple sites they might decide to feature you as well. They hope that you'll go viral and bring them a big chunk of traffic.</p>

<p>If you enter in this virtuous circle, in no time you'll end up getting featured on the biggest news sites and tv stations in the world. This is how AirBnB did it and this is the pattern many others try to use.</p>

<p>In the case of AirBnB their ""compelling story"" was that they started out by renting their own bedrooms. They started writing to local news sites and TV stations, and eventually they got picked up by CNN. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure what you're looking for exactly, but if you just want to get your startup listed search for <code>where to list my startup</code>, you'll find plenty of results.

<p>If you register a company in the US you will be paying US corporate taxes. Roughly <strong>34%</strong> AND, since you are brazilian, you will be paying <strong>27,5%</strong> when you nationalise the money.</p>

<p>So <strong>short answer is NO</strong>. </p>

<p>You don't want (and don't need!) to set up a legal entity in US in order to sell software (SaaS) to them.</p>

<li>Hiring people there</li>
<li>Credibility - when offering support/pre-sales to your corporate clients</li>

"opening limited partnership for non-residents in Canada","263","","<p>I'm running a small web-development company, all of the workforce is scattered around the globe, and there is no physical office.</p>

<p>Company is registered in my country of origin. Problem is that high tax rates are choking us, and since we don't have office or local sales force it's unclear to me why we are paying such high taxes (about 20% on salary paid to any freelancer, and 38% on company profits).</p>

<p>I've been reading about BVI and offshore possibilities, but they look shady, and we have nothing to hide!</p>

"Are people fed up with social networking sites?","262","","<p>I am planning to start a partial proximity based social networking site in next 3-4 months. I am quite worried about the invested it would take, for example</p>

","<p>Yes I feel so! People in general are fed up but hey! we are talking about some sensible people who are finding Quora reddit and other sites more capable of their intellect and hence living Facebook and other tad sites. But Facebook will eventually become more and more of Marketing and Advertising platform rather than just a ""social"" network. </p>

<p>Now coming to your idea. Well it can be awesome when you</p>

<p>1.Focus on your local customers and people first rather than spreading your wings where it doesnt even matter.</p>

<p>2.Try to do something like meetup where people withing some locality are more close and meet each other sometimes rather than having long distant group who dont even care when we dont ping them for few weeks.</p>

<p>But the ultimate rule is that people want change and the hard part for everyone is to adapt to that change. So consider that in mind and carry on!</p>

"Software giveaway: is it a good strategy to grow the user base of a desktop app?","261","","<p>I developed a <a href=""http://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap"" rel=""nofollow"">desktop tool for Windows</a>. I have a good conversion rate and good user feedback and I'm now trying to quickly grow my user base.</p>

<p>I'm considering the possibility to give free time limited licenses (6 months) through a well known european online computer magazine during a weekend.
According to them, I can expect to get about 10,000 new users.</p>

<p>The goal of this operation would be to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Test this strategy on a limited audience (one european country).</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly get new happy users (because they got a product for free) who will spread the word.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to convert them into paying users in 6 months, when their free licenses will expire.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My fears are that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Giving free licenses could devalue my product.</p></li>
<li><p>The audience will not be very targeted and the user feedback may not be so good.</p></li>
<li><p>It could cause frustration and bad comments when the licenses will expire.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Have you already used this marketing strategy?</p>
","<p>Really all you can do is run the experiment to see if it works, but I would be skeptical that a 6-month trial is necessary because your product sells itself.  All you need is more exposure and a fully-automated, streamlined trial activation and follow-up process for the pro version.  Require the user to supply and confirm an e-mail address prior to trial activation, and send a follow-up e-mail after a week to solicit feedback. The follow-up also serves as a reminder to use the software, in case the user installed it and forgot about it.</p>

<p>To answer your fears:</p>

<ol>
<li>If what you're selling is a perpetual license (rather than a subscription-based offering) and what you're giving away is effectively a time-bombed trial copy, then you're not devaluing your product.</li>
<li>Your target demographic is ""anyone who uses Windows"" so you're already ahead if a majority of the online computer magazine's readers use Windows. The best way to get feedback is to ask for it while the user is actively engaged with your product. Follow up within a few days of sending the trial, and again after a week. When the trial expires, you have a valuable opportunity to request feedback in exchange for a free trial extension.</li>
<li>If you lead people to believe the giveaway is for a perpetual license, then you'll get a lot of angry feedback. If you make it clear up front that it's a trial (and reduce the trial period to, say, 30 days) then you're doing nothing out-of-the-ordinary.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Competitors</strong></p>

<p>Your competitors are WinSplit Revolution (free) and DisplayFusion (freemium).  Look at what they do to promote their products. I prefer WinSplit over DisplayFusion because of WinSplit's more intuitive keyboard shortcuts, but I bought DisplayFusion purely because of the multi-monitor taskbar (which worked much better than the free MultiMon Taskbar). AquaSplit seems to offer several features which either replace or complement those of these other products.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you targeting?</strong></p>

<p>Freeloaders will not purchase regardless of what you do.  If your software requires 6 months before someone realizes its value, then the software will be a hard sell either way.  If someone can immediately realize its value, a 6-month trial seems excessive for desktop software.</p>

<p>With the advent of social media and deal-sharing sites, your offer through the online magazine may get more exposure than you expect, so make sure you're prepared for this possibility.</p>

<p>If you choose to offer something through the magazine, each reader will do one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>not download it</li>
<li>download it but never install it</li>
<li>download and install it, but remove it after the trial period expires</li>
<li>download and install it, and revert back to the freeware version after the trial period expires</li>
<li>download and install it, and buy the premium version after it expires</li>
</ol>

<p>What you're banking on is that enough people will fit into the 5th group. Most of those who find the promotion through a deal-sharing site will be freeloaders or will not accept a 6-month trial as a ""deal"" and won't bother to even look at your software.  But those who do see its value won't need 6 months to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Conversion</strong></p>

<p>The trick to convert someone from free to premium is that you must get exactly the right balance of free vs. paid features. If the free version isn't functional enough to be very useful on a day-to-day basis, people won't get hooked on it. It looks to me as though you've done that, but it isn't clear to me from your website whether I can get a trial of your premium product, even for 14 or 30 days.</p>

<p>These days, if there's a piece of software that I find useful for work and it costs less than $30, it doesn't even pay to think about it after I've used a fully-functional trial--I just have my employer buy it for me. If it costs more than that, I may hesitate but as long as it provides significantly more value than the free alternatives, it doesn't pay to spend much time thinking about it.  Examples: DisplayFusion, SnagIt, BeyondCompare.</p>

<p>Ideally I would just run a series of different experiments whose sole purpose is to gain exposure, and track your exposure with Google Analytics (or similar) to see what works. Make a 30-day trial publicly available. After the premium trial expires, revert back to free mode but allow the user to extend the premium mode at least one time. This reminds the user that there is some additional problem that the premium version solves, but also reminds the user that you he or she is using the premium features on borrowed time.</p>

<p>For example, I used the free version of Boomerang for Gmail for more than a year.  This product allows you to schedule messages to be sent later, or to schedule them to reappear in your inbox at some point in the future (which you specify).  After I used up my 10 free credits, Boomerang gave me the option to ""give me just 1 more!"" for several times, then the free credits were refilled at the beginning of the next month.  (A couple times I clicked ""give me 1 more message"" too many times and wasn't offered 1 more free message.) After a few months of ""give me just one more"" I decided I should subscribe, which brings us to the next point.</p>

<p>If the paid features aren't valuable enough to support the asking price, then the customer will be turned off and will go back to using the free version or will look for a cheaper competing product. This is exactly what I ended up doing, but I never did find a better product and eventually I found myself running out of credits very early in the month. I still think the asking price of Boomerang is excessive, and it took me another year of clicking ""give me 1 more message"" probably a dozen times every month before I decided it was providing enough value to my employer that I should just subscribe using my company card. If I had to pay for it myself, I would just make do with the free version and/or one of the competing products that I found.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get a trial of AquaSnap Professional?</strong></p>

<p>So, what about AquaSnap? I immediately see its value just from looking at your website, but I'm hesitant to buy anything these days without using a fully-functional trial first. If you had a single installer and I could just activate a trial of Professional mode for 30 days, you can be sure that if the Professional features work at least as well as I expect them to, I'd buy it either after receiving an e-mail follow-up a week later, or when the trial expires.</p>

"When is the appropriate time in a small business's lifecycle to start hiring on employees to handle excess or currently ignored work?","261","","<p>Speaking more specifically about my situation, I'm a developer with an increasing workload. These days I'm finding myself too busy to even chase new leads. As my reputation seems to be growing, I've had a number of potential clients actively approach me looking for work to be done, but I just don't have the time. However, cash-flow can be inconsistent. Are there any good guidelines that more experienced entrepreneurs have come up with about when is appropriate to make the leap and try to find a business partner to disperse the work? And even beyond that, <em>how</em> to find someone who's willing to work on an uneasy basis? I need, in essence, a hybrid between a freelance contractor and a part-time employee.</p>

<p>I see lots of questions on here about equity, but equity in a company like mine would be worth very little, at least to start. My company does have a couple of flagship, branded products, but I've so far focused more on the approach of developing and consulting on contract for other startups.</p>

<p>This question can easily be adapted to a similar situation I've seen a friend go through: he has a business and <em>does</em> have active, part-time employees do work on the side, but is unsure of when to hire a full-time employee to share work with, or even more abstractly, when to start thinking about hiring a marketing person, or someone of a similar profession to cover an aspect of the business that's currently left more or less unaddressed.</p>

<p>There's a temptation to hold off until I'm in a more financially stable position, but then I fear that waiting could take years, and perhaps being able to accept more work would, in fact, warrant enough stability. It's an indisputable fact that I would be making more money today if I had some help, but I just worry that that might not be the case come a couple months from now.</p>

<p>I've also thought about the idea of hiring on a paid or unpaid intern, but that still has some of the same issues behind it.</p>

<p>Just for the record, I do have office space. So the mechanics of working as a team wouldn't be disrupted.</p>
","<p>The way I see it, the problem you're facing is, more or less, <em>when can I no longer ignore the fact that  are necessary for my company's success</em>.</p>

<p>The answer I provide: <strong>it becomes necessary if it will cost you to lose out on <em>cash flow or productivity.</em></strong> Opportunity cost.</p>

<p>Take the analogy of building a house, since I think you were <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/260/better-to-learn-programming-or-hire-a-programmer"">spot on in another post</a>, regarding how you divide your time to be the most effective. It's the same situation as with hiring employees - you either <em>fill the need</em> or ignore it altogether - maybe this means you're carpenter and a painter, but the electrical work is suffering. That would be a case where you obviously need an electrician.</p>

<p>However, maybe your total skillset isn't too shabby, and between your friends and family (analogous back to current employees), you can cover everything <em>well enough to get by, maybe with an unfinished basement.</em></p>

<p>But maybe your family (company backlog etc.) has grown to 8 kids, and you really need that basement finished. You know you don't have the time or skills, so naturally you decide to hire a person with the skill to fill the need.</p>

<p>Overall - can your entire family fit into the bedroom upstairs; is there dysfunctional progress or workflow? Is your time no longer expendable?</p>

<p>Hire when you <em>need to,</em> but only when you <em>can.</em> If you can't, figure out what's holding you back and solve the problem.</p>

"Dividing Share to Investors","260","","<p>I coined a Idea for a startup. I am operating that Full time.</p>

<p>For investment I may find 2 to 3 people. How should we divide the share / profit?</p>

<p>Is Share calculation every month or annually or when they close the contract with me?</p>
","<p>Normally, profits are not distributed to shareholders every month especially in startups. For the first few years it is normal for a startup to reinvest the money it is making back into the operations in order to grow. When the company wants to distribute dividends (distributing profits to the shareholders) it would determine how much of the profits it is going to distribute, then the money would be allocated to each shareholder by the percent that shareholder owns. </p>

<p>For instance if there are three shareholders two shareholders has 25% and the other has 50%. If the profit to be distributed is $1000 the first two shareholders would get $250 each and the third shareholder would get $500. </p>

<p>Some small established companies do actually distribute profits on a monthly basis. In that case the distribution would be the same as above. Determine how much  you are going to distribute (it is a good idea to leave some amount of the profits in the company) and then divide it by the ownership percentage. </p>

<p>To make the contract with the investors, you need to determine the present or future value of the company and then calculate the percentage ownership they are going to have based on the investment they are making in the company. If the company is currently valued at $100 and they are investing $50 dollars then they would have 33% of the company. When you divide profits, that investor would get 33% of the amount that the owners (shareholders) agreed to have distributed as dividends. </p>

<p>Sometimes things do not go so objectively. For example, an investor can say that he would invest only if you give him 50% and you have to make a decision based on that. You can try negotiating to lower the percent or increase the investment. If you feel the investment he is making is significant and having him on board is going to be beneficent to the enterprise then you may agree. </p>

"How avoid Chargeback with Digital Goods/SaaS?","260","","<p>My website works in ""pay per month"" system, the user need to pay every month to stay with the product/service or can use only for one month, in this case only not pay for more one month.</p>

<p>Since last year the PayPal cover the ""Digital Goods"", but only for the Disputes in PayPal. About the dispute: the BUYER is always the winner!</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How Uber, Facebook, Google, Rackspace, Amazon (AWS or Digital Goods), Steam can avoid the chargeback?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters they don't accept payments using PayPal. That's a big problem right there which is relatively straightforward to fix and immediately impactful - if only because you now get to actually fight the chargebacks if you so desire.</p>

<p>Next, they honor refund requests, at least for the most part. Better a refund than a chargeback fee. (Unless you're <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/technology/ashley-madison-dispute-bill/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ashley Madison</a> and get to fight all refunds and chargebacks by sending extremely embarrassing snail mail.)</p>

<p>What more, they deliver a well respected enough service and they've a strong enough brand that even if a consumer asks for a refund they'll be OK with receiving credits.</p>

<p>Lastly, they use sophisticated (and very expensive) fraud-detection tools. At the slightest doubt you end up a barrage of checks (e.g. Visa calling you by telephone) to double-check that it's indeed you who are making a payment - you can't really tell your CC company things like ""I didn't pay for this"" if they confirmed on the phone that it was you entering your CC details.</p>

<p>The unfortunate reality is that, in your case, chargebacks are a side effect and a cost of selling digital goods online. There are CC thieves out there who test cards by placing orders on digital goods sites. There's a - small - minority of consumers who ask for chargebacks instead of refunds on just about anything they're unhappy with. And an even smaller minority who do the same even if they're happy. You can think of it like online piracy: you can take steps to fight it, sure. Will it really be worth your time and money to do so? Probably not; unless fighting it means creating a product or service that is so compellingly good that consumers will love you for it and not want refunds.</p>

"Hiring for a Technology Startup","253","","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I am a software developer, with 12 plus years of commercial development experience. I have used a variety of development platforms over the years, and have used cloud computing services extensively over the past few years to develop scale-able software.</p>

<p><strong>Idea</strong></p>

<p>I am convinced that I have a good idea for a website. </p>

<p>I am facing a dilemma in that, I want to share this idea with someone who I can trust, who is experienced enough in the IT industry, to honestly say - whether it will work or not, but someone who will not run away with the idea behind my back :-)</p>

<p><strong>Hiring Help</strong></p>

<p>I am a realist - I know that having a day job and a young family, mean that I need help, even to develop a prototype. Again, the person I hire for working on this website must be trustworthy.</p>

<p>My question is this: is there a way to employ a developer and only let him work on bits and pieces, so he/she does not get the whole picture/idea? I am pretty sure this would not work, as it will become pretty apparent what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>What are the alternatives? Should I patent the idea (spend big bucks for something I do not know will be successful or not)? Should I contractually bind the developer in a non-disclosure agreement? Should I offer the developer a share of proceeds when they happen (maybe years into the future)? Or all of the above?</p>

<p><strong>Side Notes</strong></p>

<p>Also note that while I have many friends in the IT industry, most of them do not have time for a side-project, certainly not the amount of time I would require for this project, so I cannot hire them.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, I would give up my day job, not rely on anyone for technical expertise to get the site up and running, but I do have bills to pay :-( so this is not an option.</p>
","<p>Fellow software guy here... also investor in various startups, and also a founder with 2 exits. </p>

<p>You've heard this a thousand times, because it is true: Ideas are a dime a dozen... we call ideas ""MULTIPLIERS"", because they multiply the factor of a good execution team. Read <a href=""https://sivers.org/multiply"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> from Derek Sivers, where he talks about the X effect.</p>

<p>If you have over 12 years in the software business, you must have some co-workers, technical friends, business friends to talk to. Further more, if it is a good idea, you should probably talk to your 'potential' customers, those that may pay/use the product you will be building, and hear their feedback directly.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have already done that (validated your idea with your future customers) and you've made your mind and want to implement it with someone else, you'll most likely need to form a business and share some equity with such co-founder.  </p>

<p>Don't go crazy with legal paperwork and fees, you can get most of your formation docs, founder agreement, NDA, advisor agreement, etc. for free or very cheap at <a href=""http://www.upcounsel.com"" rel=""nofollow"">UpCounsel</a>. You'll hear from lots of people to go all crazy with companies in Delaware and a ton of 'best practices', but the best advice I can give you is, DON'T OVERTHINK IT, do what requires the least amount of energy to protect yourself and the company, and focus on the product.</p>

<p>If you are new in the business of starting up, I'd advise getting some guidance from incubation programs like <a href=""http://fi.co"" rel=""nofollow"">Founder Institute</a>, local business leaders, or a local startup accelerator with reputable exits. They will help you protect your idea, and IP overall... surround yourself with people that complement your skills, and it'll be really hard to fail. </p>

<p>Oh, and no VC, Investor, or Incubator will sign an NDA to hear your idea... but that's not a bad thing... we get hundreds of people with ideas, imagine if we had to sign an NDA for each one... ufff! We are not in the business of stealing ideas, but rather in the business of finding people who want to execute on an idea... and who better than the ideator him/her-self? </p>

<p>Ultimately, most founders in the software business do better with co-founder. Look in your circle of trust, long time friends, people you admire, leaders you follow and have good rapport with. Just try to get out there to find your perfect match... and most importantly... follow your gut. </p>

<p>Also, if you want to get an army of workers, and don't have the cash to hire consultants and such, you can share equity from work (!=coFounder)... try (after you get a co-founder) something like <a href=""https://assembly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ASSEMBLY</a> for that.</p>

"How to Hire and Commission Resellers, Affiliates, and Contract Sales People","249","","<p>I'd like to find some contract-based sales people in my state (Idaho). Does that concept make sense? How do I go about doing it?</p>
","<p>It makes very good sense. It's called referral marketing, indirect sales channels (i.e. resellers), or affiliate marketing depending on the setup.</p>

<p>Let's start by getting the obvious out of the way... The commission depends:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On your industry.</p></li>
<li><p>On what you're selling.</p></li>
<li><p>On how unique what you're selling is.</p></li>
<li><p>On how easy it is to convince users to check out what you have to offer.</p></li>
<li><p>On your conversion rate once they send you a lead.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some pointers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your conversion rate is below industry average (~2.5%), just forget it -- you may find some but they'll only stick around if they really like you. If it's good (5% or so) you'll likely generate interest. If it's excellent (10% or more), affiliates will come to you.</p></li>
<li><p>In some sectors your affiliates (or more appropriately, resellers) might be happy with 5% commissions. In others, they'll expect 50% or more before raising a finger.</p></li>
<li><p>Related to the latter point, the commission you'll expect will be very different depending on whether you're mentioning the product as an aside as bonus potential revenue, actively reselling what a supplier offers with a sales team, or operating as an affiliate and hoping to make a living off of it. For instance, if you mention a book as part of your content marketing, you'll be satisfied with Amazon's standard puny affiliate commission. At the other extreme, if you're actively referring users to an info product, you'll want a 50% commission -- or more, if you've a big list.</p></li>
<li><p>From a psychology viewpoint, there's a trap that you must avoid. Below a $$$ threshold, you're referring people ""because you like the product or service"". Above a certain threshold, you're referring people ""because you can make good money doing so"". Call the first ""tipping off referrers"" if you will, and the second ""commissioning affiliate marketers"". Anything in between, and you're throwing money out the window because your affiliates won't be making enough to actively send you leads -- and they'll realize it very, very fast, so you'll just be over-rewarding passive referrers.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're aiming for referrals more than resellers and affiliates, something as low as nothing at all (requires that you send them a lead every so often) or a dinner works. Or perhaps two sport event tickets or two opera tickets or whatever. Be creative based on what they like. There are plenty of colorful ways to get referrals.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As to finding them, consider synergies. For instance:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Who can you partner with in such a way that you send leads to them and vice versa?</p></li>
<li><p>Who has an audience that is potentially interested in what you're offering, without being your competitor?</p></li>
</ol>

"What are the advantages of equity-based financing over debt-based options?","248","","<p>It seems like a no-brainer to me to take debt-based options over equity-based financing.</p>

<p>Is there an objective way to decide between the two? Furthermore, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>It seems like a no-brainer to me to take debt-based options over equity-based financing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven't said <em>why</em> you consider debt to be more preferable than equity finance—but one presumes it is some combination of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>control is not shared with a lender</strong> (whereas equity investors with whom one may not always agree might exercise significant control over the business).  However, lenders may require certain <em>covenants</em> (i.e. contractual promises) that in reality restrict your freedom to control the business as you wish: for example, a bank may insist that there be no change of ownership or strategy so long as its debt remains outstanding; or they may require that certain performance targets be met.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>profits are not shared with a lender</strong> (whereas equity investors take a slice of everything you make).  However, the cost of debt finance (i.e. interest charges) does in fact reduce the business's profits; furthermore, it should not be ignored that <em>because</em> they don't share in the profits (nor are they exposed to as much risk), lenders have relatively little incentive to see the business succeed&mdash;thus equity investors will often go much further to help than a lender (and such help can be invaluable, especially during a startup's early years).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>interest payments on debt are tax-deductible</strong> (whereas dividends to equity investors are not).  However, this is only a benefit <em>provided that the profits are reinvested in the business's growth</em>: as soon as the profits are distributed to shareholders, tax must be paid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>upon repayment of a loan, relationships with lenders draw to a close</strong> (whereas one can be stuck with equity investors for a long time).  However, in reality, one very often continues those relationships over multiple financing rounds (and walking away from such a key relationship can be difficult without raising concerns from future investors).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>debt is a relatively cheap source of finance</strong> (whereas equity investors expect a much higher return and thus take a much more costly share of the profits).  However, debt capital must be repaid with interest (which might be calculated at an unpredictable, variable rate); any breach of these or other covenants could ultimately lead to the business being wound up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>debt enables an equity investment to be geared-up</strong>.  However, a leveraged business is more vulnerable should it fall upon tough times; indeed, shareholders will recognise this risk and be <em>less willing</em> to provide further equity finance to a highly geared business.  Furthermore, ensuring that covenants are not breached may stifle growth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's also worth bearing in mind that lenders may demand a charge over business assets or even personal guarantees that may be called upon in the event of default; whereas shareholders usually accept that their investment is higher risk and are willing to write-off their losses in the event of failure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an objective way to decide between the two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It is a trade-off between risk and return.</strong>  There is no objective way to decide something that boils down to the personal risk appetites and cashflows of the shareholders involved: the exact same business could be entirely financed by equity (if backed by an investor with a low risk appetite but sufficient cash) or entirely by debt (if backed by an investor with a high risk appetite or insufficient cash).</p>

<p>In reality businesses tend to be financed by a mix of the two, according to the risk appetites and cash resources of the investors involved.</p>

"Should I attempt building an app myself for my startup?","246","","<p>I think my startup would benefit from having an app. There are many apps out there that are similar to the one I want to build, but none of them are really that good and there's definitely a demand-- I already validated the idea with my target audience. I cannot afford to hire a developer to build the app. So, I'm thinking about building it myself. </p>

<p>I have some front-end programming experience, but my back-end knowledge is very limited. I know enough to build a simple &amp; good looking website, but I've never built an app before. I'm thinking of <em>trying</em> to build the app myself and learning along the way. But, I'm not sure if that's a good idea, because it would be my very first app and I'll likely run into a lot of issues building it.</p>

<p>Should I attempt to build it myself? Or should I wait until I practice and learn more about the app creation process before I take on a fairly big project such as this? I'm a student, so paying a developer $40/hour is out of the question.</p>
","<p><em>This answer is based on the fact that you are a student. I'm assuming you are young and lack any real serious professional skill either in technology or in another field critical to your business. If you are an expert at something critical to your business, ignore my answer and just go find a partner who can code. The following is advice for the young, financially-challenged, but driven student entrepreneur.</em></p>

<p>As an entrepreneur, to get just about anything done, you'll need to provide either time or money. Since you have no money, your only option is giving your own time. Assuming you have time to spare away from your studies, <strong>yes</strong>, you should build it yourself.</p>

<p>When you say ""front-end programming,"" you could either mean JavaScript in a browser or you could mean designing with HTML/CSS. If you mean JavaScript, and if you're pretty good at it, you should be able to learn to build apps pretty fast. The fundamentals of JavaScript are very similar to just about any other <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">C-family language</a> (including Swift for iOS and Java of Android). Apps are really just front-ends, after all, just like websites. On the other hand, if your skills are limited to designing HTML/CSS, then unfortunately, you have a ways to go before you can consider yourself even a beginner programmer. Start with a learning-to-program book.</p>

<p>As for the back-end, there are really two distinct topics to learn: programming your apps and server administration. If you already know JavaScript, a natural progression might be to learn <a href=""https://nodejs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Node</a>, which is just JavaScript on the server. It's basically the same language you are using now with some extra features to do things you can't do in a browser (like saving files, etc).  You can use a framework like <a href=""https://expressjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Express</a> to make things easier with Node. You could also go beyond JavaScript with languages like <a href=""https://www.ruby-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby</a> (try the <a href=""http://www.sinatrarb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sinatra</a> framework) or <a href=""https://www.python.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Python</a> (try the <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Flask</a> framework).</p>

<p>As for administering the server(s), that part is tough to learn and you'd probably be better off abstracting the complexity away to start with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service#Providers"" rel=""nofollow"">platform-as-a-service provider</a> (tip: <a href=""https://www.heroku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Heroku</a> and <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/appengine/"" rel=""nofollow"">Google App Engine</a> are well-regarded but can be expensive to scale if you get big).</p>

<p>Now, if there's one thing you take away from this answer please make it this: you <strong>must</strong> develop actual software if you want to learn programming. Practicing little bits of unrelated code and learning without applying will get you absolutely no where. So <strong>yes</strong> start with this actual app right from the start (along with other apps you will work on while learning). However, don't treat this app or any other app you will ever code as a ""big project."" Programming is about taking many small, incremental steps. The first version of your app should be the name of your app and a close button (or some other tiny bit of progress). Keep repeating the tiny steps, adjusting as necessary, and you will become a successful programmer.</p>

"What should I do with my app when I close my start-up","246","","<p>I going to close my start-up because of not enough earnings. </p>

<p>I've got 5 applications on the AppStore and I don't know if it's better to leave them for people or removing them.</p>

<p>Hope that's not too broad or opinion based. </p>

<p>I really don't know what to do.<br />
Maybe the fact to leave my apps on the store will diserve me in the future.</p>
","<p>That's a tough call. I think you have to decide on a per-app basis.</p>

<p>Before you can make any decisions on the matter, though, you need to think about what you want out of this. Are you worried about your reputation? Are your apps serving as a force for good in the world that you wouldn't want to remove from it? That sort of thing. Once you figure that out, the question of what to do with them will probably become a bit easier to answer. Emphasis on ""a bit.""</p>

<p>Whether you're worried about your reputation is really up to you. You probably should be, it's pretty rare for a reputation to have no effect, but how much this actually affects it is pretty hard to tell.</p>

<p>It seems like this question is deserving of a list of pros and cons, so here's a start:</p>

<p>By leaving the app up, you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let people see you're awesome work. That includes potential employers, and any consumers of apps you develop in the future, who will trust you more if you have several apps up.</li>
<li>Might make a bit of money off of it. Maybe not enough to qualify as a primary source of income, but a little extra never hurt.</li>
<li>Leave open the, albeit perhaps unlikely, possibility that you'll build a strong overnight following because of one person with one blog out in a country you've never heard of. Stranger things have happened.</li>
</ul>

<p>By taking it down, you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never have to think about it again. Peace of mind!</li>
<li>Don't risk your reputation if something goes wrong. If it's a complicated app, or if it needs a backend that's always running, something will go wrong, and it's better to have a clean break with your users informed, than just to disappear one day.</li>
<li>Don't risk having to spend money on it. Again, if it's complicated and needs a backend, don't waste your money. But if maintaining it is just a matter of watching the download count go up and maybe making $0.25 now and then from a click, what's the harm.</li>
<li>Don't risk things going wrong that you don't know about. If something does fail, particularly if some breaking change is made to an OS long after you've forgotten about it, it could sit there just annoying people without your knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a more philosophical level, you'll also want to think about the impact of having several ""dead"" apps out there. I'm not sold on whether that's a good or a bad thing, but that depends how you play it. On one hand, you've had a lot of ventures, and you're a go-getter with a lot of talent. On the other, you've had a lot of <em>failed</em> ventures, and you don't know when to give up. As long as you can get people seeing the first option, first, you should be fine.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it's just a decision you have to make on a per-case basis. Look at what you actually, baseline, have to put into the apps, and look at the types of jobs you're otherwise looking for (and whether they'd benefit from a more diversified portfolio). When you have all the information, and you're probably close enough to that, making a good list of pros and cons is probably a good way to make it clear what you should do. It doesn't work for every decision, but I think it might for this one.</p>

"Starting a Completely New Industry","245","","<p>Everybody has heard about eating contests (such as the hotdog eating contest).  What I want to do with my life is to create a brand new industry of competitive eating: marathon eating!</p>

<p>Traditional contests sees how much food (like hot dogs) people can eat in 10 minutes, but marathon eating sees how much food people can eat in longer time spans (such as 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, etc.).  While this is similar to traditional contests, it is a much different skill (just like marathon running is much different than sprinting!)</p>

<p>I have spent the last 3 years working on this art.  I have a long way to go, but here are some of my proudest accomplishments:</p>

<ul>
<li>109 McDoubles in 12 hours</li>
<li>27 KFC Family Feast 8 meals in 24 hours</li>
<li>9 Costco Rotisserie Chickens in 3 hours</li>
<li>83 Olive Garden Breadsticks and 19 full bowls of Olive Garden Salads in 4 hours</li>
<li>44 boxes of Oreos in 8 hours</li>
<li>34 boxes of Lucky Charms (no milk) in 6 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>So my question...</p>

<p>I have an idea and I have a talent, but how do I get started turning this into a thing?</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is for this to be a multi-billion dollar industry, with corporate sponsors, competitive teams, ridiculous signing bonuses, college teams and drafts, and ubiquitous fantasy leagues that everybody follows.  But I recognize that I need to start small and work my way up.  I have a $300k (from my 401k) that I'm willing to put into funding this dream.  Where do I start?</p>
","<p>At first I thought this whole idea was ridiculous, but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced there would absolutely be a market for competitive marathon eating, but only if you could put together a foundation organization that can draw enough attention to make the whole idea sustainable.</p>

<p>There aren't many people in this world who can answer a question about starting a completely new thing like this (myself included), so it's hard to give you any well-informed advice; however, I think you could find parallels in different competitive areas and adopt best practices from successful competitive activities.</p>

<p>The first thing I would do is start a formal competitive league. Some organization needs to set the rules, verify everything, promote the ""sport,"" set up conferences, organize industry-wide media deals, bring together investors/sponsors, adjudicate disputes, humor the social justice warriors, provide controversy to the propagandists, and organize anything else that comes up. Competitive eating has leagues, as does competitive gaming, pro sports, etc. Setting up the authoritative organization seems like a perfect first step.</p>

<p>You'd have to study what others do, but it's possible the league organization might be a non-profit. Around that organization, other companies may form that will be for-profit. Some of these for-profit organizations might elect a delegate to represent them in the non-profit's decision making arm. Making the league for-profit is an invitation for competition should you become popular but not dominant. (It's harder to compete against a non-profit than a for-profit, all else equal.) However, you'd have to have an interest in some for-profit entity in the sport to make money if the league is non-profit.</p>

<p>Once you have the basic league in place, it needs to immediately being to fulfill its mission by putting on events, promoting them as much as possible, distributing media and commentary on as many platforms as possible, and inviting new people to become stakeholders, fans, or observers of marathon eating. If you can add some drama to the events, that might help. You don't have to get too fancy to start -- it's more important you have many events and competitions rather than one or two grand productions. Over time, you can improve the quality of the events.</p>

<p>The primary reason I think this could do well is because of how controversial it could be. You will face enormous criticism (mostly manufactured, of course) which can draw enormous attention. ""All publicity is good publicity"" could absolutely apply here if you can harness it the right way.</p>

<p>PS. Make sure you understand the tax implications of withdrawing money from your 401(K) if you are not yet of retirement age.</p>

","<p>It seems like you are facing a scaling problem and it is something many small businesses face as they grow. The solution is two step. Figure out what you need to scale to solve your problem and then figure out how to achieve that scaling</p>

<p>What needs to scale</p>

<ol>
<li>Plastic boxes - </li>
</ol>

<p>a. Convince someone else to go into the business. Since there is nobody doing it, and there is a demand (your startup being an obvious customer) convince a friend or a business to make a custom plastic parts business in your area. You can commit orders to him and even partner with him to get a cost advantage</p>

<p>b. Make boxes yourself using molded plastic. Plastic boxes are not hard to make. If you get the raw materials, you can use vacuum forming and use thermosetting plastic to make cheap and easy parts. (Look on youtube for vacuum forming.) If you want more professional ones, you can look for a used or small injection molding machine</p>

<p>c. Make boxes yourself from pieces. You can make the boxes by gluing acrylic pieces together as well. Or you can use a material other than plastic that would meet your requirements that is easier to work with.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>PCB printing - Again, partnering with someone else to do this might be advantageous. But PCB printing is again a scalable activity. On the very small scale, you have hand soldering using perfboard. If you want etched boards, they are not hard to make if you can get the etching chemicals and there lots of tutorials for etching using a regular inkjet or laser printer. If you want to scale up higher than that, you can get a small or used PCB etching machine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Resources for scaling</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Labor - In many parts of the world, it is feasible to substitute machinery with labor at least in the small scale. If your volume requirement is small and labor is cheap and available, you could hire extra workers to to help you make these parts. </p></li>
<li><p>Raising capital for scaling</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you require new investment to scale, do a cost study and find out how much you need to raise to accomplish your scaling requirement. Remember you want to scale to keep up with realistic sales forecasts or market demand and you do not want too much extra capacity which would lay idle. </p>

<p>If you require capital for hiring more workers or buying equipment, then you could </p>

<p>a. Raise capital through equity - You can raise equity capital by investing more money into the business from your own pocket. This way, you keep your share of the business. If you are unable to do so, you can try to bring an investor for a percentage share of the business</p>

<p>b. Raise capital through debt - The easiest way to get debt financing is through a loan. You can see if your friends and family is interested in giving you a loan. You can also approach the government business development boards or a commercial loan. Look for interest free loans and grants. Remember if you are unable to pay back the loan, you could lose your business.</p>

<p>c. Mixed mode. You can combine your capital requirement with part equity and part debt. </p>

<p>Things to keep in mind. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scaling organically or scaling as your business grows by reinvesting profits is the best way to scale as you do not have to go into debt or loose ownership stake of your company. </p></li>
<li><p>As long as your product is functional and meets the customers needs, it does not matter how your product was made. The customer is not going to know or care if your product was hand made in your garage or if it was made with million dollar equipment in a state of the art factory <strong>as long as the product works and meets the customer's expectations</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you make a profit. An important factor that goes along with having cheaper products than the competition is whether you can make a decent profit selling cheap. If you cannot make a profit, your business would not be able to grow and sustain itself, and sooner or later, competition with more capital can come in and remove you from the market.</p></li>
<li><p>Be realistic of your market assessment. Lack of competition may also mean that others do not think they can make a profit in the market or they maybe seeing inhibiting factors that you have missed. Be thorough and prudent in your assessment.</p></li>

"Where does online business selling digital goods pay tax?","241","","<p>I'm a resident of the UK and run a website selling digital services. All of the assets are based in Canada, and the majority (93%) if transactions come from the US.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, where should the business be registered, and to which country should it pay tax? My intention was to incorporate in the UK, and report any income once the income is placed in a UK bank account, however the majority of the money that the business receives should be exempt from UK tax, since the buyers are non-EU residents and they are not receiving an item from the EU. Therefore should I be paying business tax in the UK, and only my personal income tax in the UK?</p>

<p>Could someone offer some advice on this, and correct me if I'm wrong anywhere?</p>
","<p>Firstly - your UK company is liable to UK taxes. I do not know what tax you refer to when you say ""business tax"" - I take it you are talking about Corporation Tax.  This tax is due on profits, regardless on if you sell locally or around the world.  Several countries have corporation tax, but at different levels. If you are a small mom/pop shop then careful expenditure controls can ensure you don't make a profit (or make a small profit) so that the corporation tax is nill, or null.</p>

<p>Buying goods from north America that you expect to sell back to north america could leave you liable to their taxes. If not, it would leave a foreign business having an unfair advantage over a North American business. You need advice from an accountant in the US or Canada to clear this up. Avoid at your peril - Some years back Tony Blair agreed that extradition to the US was possible based on less evidence than would be required to bring a case in UK law. Search for the NatWest 3 as that was a test case.</p>

<p>Opening a business in another country to skirt tax is bound to rub someone somewhere the wrong way. Tax efficiency is legal. Tax avoidance is illegal. </p>

<p>Most (all?) countries require a <em>local resident</em> to represent the Company. Some countries require a minimum of two people (ie England/Wales require a Company Secretary and a Managing Director, two or more people). Germany has a UG status (similar to Ltd in the UK) but one officer is sufficient.</p>

<p>Thus - If you open a business outside your country of residence, you will have to pay for someone else to act on your behalf. Various legal documents can be used to help cover your risks, but they can never be 100% eliminated.</p>

<p>I've had a UK Limited company for 20+ years - It is good that you ask questions about tax structure, but if I can offer one piece of advice: Taxman has seen it, felt it, sniffed it, touched it, tasted it, slept with it, bedded it, bought the t-shirt and seen the movie. Avoid spending time/energy on avoiding tax, instead, think your business thru, then think about tax efficiency (increase you expenses, therefore reduce profits for example - training courses, business travel, hardware are all valid expenses, and if you are vat registered, you get to claim back any UK VAT paid).</p>

<p>I have a few ideas how to market to my target audience and hope that they will follow me, but I think it's also important to simply gain followers in general even if they are not my target audience for 2 reasons - first I think people are more likely to follow someone if they already have a lot of followers, and second because it will improve my search results.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong> - Grow user base through direct marketing to customers.  Do not promote anything.  Do not pay to get more followers.  If the business is located locally and will not have any international targets, block access from many developing countries to prevent likes from unengaged followers.</p>

<p><strong>Google+</strong> - Google blocks automatic posts from other sources so many people use this as their base for posting messages.  Use this to post directly to Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and other sites of they apply.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter</strong> - Growing user base is important.  Find any and all relevant users that tweet a lot and follow them.  Ask some to visit your site in hopes of having them follow you.  User base count is important but undetermined if it's worthwhile to pay for followers.  Probably not worth much.</p>

<p><strong>Pinterest</strong> - If you have images that you want customers to look at again which relates to selling your merchandise/branding, allow users to Pin images from your site to Pinterest.  Have your own Pinterest page with all important images from your site in appropriate categories.  This can be a burden to maintain so do not overdo it.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Not just for a company page.  Page must first start from employee which means the company page revolves around an individual first and that individual's page matters more initially.  Make sure you have joined several groups and have followers so that when you add your corporate page, others will see it and you can promote it.</p>

<p><strong>Instagram</strong> - Main social media site for the younger crowd.  Do not post images alone.  Add text, #, and @ similar to twitter.  May as well post same message to Twitter as Instagram.  User base count here matters and people tend to have almost 2x as many followers here than on Twitter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it's also important to simply gain followers in general even if they are not my target audience for 2 reasons - first I think people are more likely to follow someone if they already have a lot of followers, and second because it will improve my search results.</p>

<p>It's not necessarily true, and beware of doing this kind of stuff on Facebook. See these two videos:</p>

<p>What they explain in a nutshell is that the more <em>unengaged</em> FB users you have, the worse off you are. FB doesn't send your message to <em>all</em> of your users; it sends it to <em>some</em>. The number of Likes you get from the sample determines whether the message reaches more users. As such, the less engaged your users are as a group, the less you'll be able to reach the users who want to engage with you.</p>

<p>Anyway, based on the above, my answers to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any startup groups where people follow each other to help get an initial base? 
  Anyone know of a group like this, and if not, want to start one with me?</p>

<p>... would be that you should revisit the idea of doing any of this, at least for FB, because even if these groups exist participating in them may work <em>against</em> you.</p>

"Pros & Cons of Vermont's VCorp (Virtual Corporation)","239","","<p>Just ran across a mention of Vermont's VCorp (Virtual Corporation) and wonder what the pros &amp; cons of them are, especially related to raising funds and legal matters; aka how do they compare to Delaware's LLCs?</p>
","<p>In general, if you're a US resident - you should be incorporating in the State where you're resident and/or where you operate. That's for the simple reason that you're required to register there <em>anyway</em> regardless of where you incorporated - so why not incorporate there?</p>

<p>There are very few reasons to incorporate in a foreign State for a US resident, and you should have a lawyer explain to you which of these reasons apply <strong>to you</strong> before you do that. You need to be able to justify that extra spending for yourself and your business.</p>

<p>Specifically to Vermont V-Corp, it is a Corp. There's nothing special there, and nothing worth the extra dime spending to fund the Vermont government. They legally allow conducting meetings virtually/online, but to the best of my understanding - this is not the main issue that causes problem to any business owner. In any case, for most parts I do not believe other States actually require physical meetings. Conference calls have been an acceptable way of communications since the early last century. Nothing new there. In any case, for most startups the people involved meet with each other regularly regardless.</p>

"How much competition is too much?","237","","<p>I have found some more competition for the app I was looking to build. The competitors are offering essentially the same service I was planning to and in at least one case, more, at about the same price point: $89/year.</p>

<p>Of course even if I was the first person to market with the idea, competition would eventually pop up. So I'm not concerned about competition in general. But with such low price point to start with, I'd be looking at a very quick race to the bottom.</p>

<p>I suppose I could go for an advertising model (it's a content subscription service), and make the app free?</p>

<p>The general question is how do you decide if there's too much existing competition to bother entering a market? I'd appreciate input on my particular case as well.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>The app/service is text to speech for educators, students and to a lesser extent, indie ebook authors. Upload a text document (.txt, .pdf. .doc) and get a .mp3 of the content.</p>
","<p>TL; DR: You should be fine. No need to worry about competition in the text-to-speech space: the <em>growth</em> factor should outweigh the <em>competition</em> factor.</p>

<p><em>Note: This answer depends on one important inference: that speech-to-text, and speech recognition are easily derived from a core text-to-speech capability. If this is not true, indicate so and I will revise my answer. However, this, as written, should give you an idea of how I would frame the issue.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you decide if there's too much existing competition to bother entering a market?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, a growing pie makes room for new eaters. But a shrinking pie leaves people hungry so every eater needs to fight to get full. In other words, the <em>competition</em> analysis is coupled to the <em>growth</em> analysis. They are complementary components of your overall strategic opportunity.</p>

<p><a href=""http://findbiometrics.com/speech-voice-recognition-market-to-hit-5-1-billion-26111"" rel=""nofollow"">According to this article</a>, the industry is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 40% thru 2024 to exceed $5 billion. That is significant growth potential.</p>

http://findbiometrics.com/speech-voice-recognition-market-to-hit-5-1-billion-26111/

<blockquote>
  <p>the global market for this biometric modality will grow from $249 million to $5.1 billion by the year 2024.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My opinion is that text-to-speech is an enormous growth space and if you have an opening (vis-a-vis technology, business contacts, marketing relationships etc.) you should enter that space no matter what the current competitive field looks like.</p>

<p>There are also so many spinoff product ideas that can be leveraged from the core tech it takes to develop a product of the nature you describe, that even if competition in the space of this particular (current) product imposes downward pressure on margins, new high-margin opportunities should arise during the life cycle of the current product.</p>

<p>That last paragraph was an eyeful. Let's restate that. If the current product fails to yield a high return, you should have new product opportunities you can pivot to.</p>

<p>The space is ripe for growth. IoT. Driverless vehicles. In general everything tech is moving toward text-to-speech (and speech-to-text) which I am inferring is easily derived.</p>

<p>First, congrats on stepping outside the box! Prepare to get flak from the startup community for going against their tradition. I don't agree that you should get any flak, but, at the end of this post, I'll explain why you may get flak, and how to avoid it.</p>

<p><strong>The Critical Question: Are you coming from money?</strong>
The critical question is- do you currently have a strong funding source, or are you starting from scratch?</p>

<p>A strong funding source would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing business generating over 200K in profits after paying your living costs.</li>
<li>Disposable savings/family money over $300K. (Not 300K, but a disposable 300K that you could be happy to lose.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people I am aware of who did this first had one core business or funding source which provided a lot- often millions.
Then, they split that revenue into many other ventures.</p>

<p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Classic example: Sir Richard Branson of Virgin. He started with Virgin Records. Only once that gained momentum, did he move to other things. But I wonder what stage it was at when he began to branch? That should be a well-documented case.</p></li>
<li><p>Ray Sharma might be one example of someone who started many things at once. But from what I know, it was mostly his work on Extreme Labs that generated the revenue for the rest of his businesses. I personally am skeptical that he started with dozens of companies before striking it big on one:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Sharma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Sharma</a></p></li>
<li><p>I know of someone whose father was into real estate. When he inherited the business, he then invested in several tech companies.
I cannot say whether that was wise, I don't know. I think he did have some successes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From what I've seen in incubators and friends- parallel entrepreneurism is very rare. But, it's also rarely attempted. Most people fall into a specific passion.</p>

<p><strong>Starting from scratch:</strong>
Personally, I think this is possible but hard. I've personally tried to start side projects, even non-profit ones, and I've always found that it just ends up taking too much focus from my core revenue-generating activity. That is only my experience, and I do believe that there could be better ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Founding an incubator is the modern way to do it. There's also often government funds to help subsidize these incubators. You might be able to find many partners who will contribute seed capital. It may be hard to convince people without existing startup experience.</li>
<li>Traditional way I've seen: Start slowly with real estate. Sell some in 15 years and use that as seed capital. Might sound like a long term plan, but it's been done before and therefore somewhat realistic.</li>
<li>Crowdfund many interesting ideas. You'll need a lot of cash for marketing, videos and possibly prototyping. KickStarter does NOT sell itself. I'd budget at least $14K (in 2014 dollars) per KickStarter if you want to build any momentum. (Factoring in a proper video, plus marketing of at least $7K, plus a prototype.) That might sound expensive, but trust me, I've tried it. Kick Starting without existing momentum is hard.</li>
<li>Outsource or build businesses in overseas markets, where labour and startup costs are less expensive. Odesk.com is your friend in this case.</li>
<li>Compete for large contracts. For example, in Canada, you can pitch your tech business products to the government for a $400-500K contract. (It's called BCIP.) I'd recommend getting professional writers to make the application, if you can afford it. That alone can be about $7K.</li>
<li>Become a web marketing guru. This will take years of experience, but I do know of a marketing guru who <strong>claims</strong> to make about $100K per webinar. Now, is he exaggerating this claim? I don't know. From my business conversations with him, and spending time with him personally, he seems to definitely be making strong revenue. But I'm skeptical enough not to try it. He pointed to resources like WarriorForum.com as a starting point. Looks spammy, but I haven't tried it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why is this (currently, 2014) against the grain?</strong>
People have found, so far, that focusing intensely on one idea or market is the key to breaking into it. Incubators and pro investors have been burned time and time again by entrepreneurs who abandon one idea for another, or who have divided attention, or who overcommit. Due to many incubators' history of failure with founders who are parallel entrepreneurs, they shun it. In fact, top incubators likely will not accept anyone who has an outside business, even if it seems positive. There are exceptions in some cases, of course, but it's rare.</p>

<p><strong>I had to deal with this mentality myself.</strong>
I was told this specifically when I tried to start a 2nd business and applied to Extreme Labs. They said my current business (call it First Inc), which was very profitable at the time, was a problem for them, because I had too little to lose. Should things go great with my existing business, I'll stop focusing on the new company. Should the new company start failing, why would I pour more time into the new company when I have an alternative?</p>

<p>It's also very expensive to grow, so spreading marketing, tech and sales dollars thin will be problematic.</p>

<p><strong>Positioning it Without Getting Flak</strong>
However, if you position it correctly, as in ""I want to make a better incubator"" rather than ""I have 5 different businesses I want to start"" then it's possible to do this without going against the grain.</p>

"When is it worth to quit and start your own way?","235","","<p>I am working for a small startup for years and although I get a moderate market salary as senior developer, I can see that the incomes of the company increasing a lot because of my effort, but others with less responsibility, less work get higher salary. Sometimes I feel if I would go on my own way and I would choose my own sales people, the whole development and sales process could be more efficient. I would not conclude meaningless compromises, debates with sales people. The way of development would not be determined by sales people who want to protect their own position, communication channel to clients, but I would set up a product which is already made regard to maintenance purpose, where client can customise / maintain services on GUI, without the need to call us, keep contact, arrange meetings, buy flight ticket, book hotels, etc.</p>

<p>So my personal impression is we are wasting a lot of money, we are not efficient, and I guess these not bothers only me, but at other companies it exist too. Is it any business literature that covers this topic?  I would read more about it or read your opinion. </p>

<p>So when is it worth to quit a job and start your own business in the same industry, even dow I know - and this is my case too - one year after termination you are not allowed earn any money at that industry.</p>
","<p>There are probably a few things to consider when you are thinking about leaving to start something on your own.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind with your situation is that even if you wanted to branch off and 'start over' that would likely take a substantial amount of time to develop a new product, client base, sales team, marketing efforts and the multitude of business decisions that would come from making your own company. Depending on your location and the licensing of your product(s) unless you have copyright over these products you also have to be careful not to step on legal toes.</p>

<p>It could be that your current company does have some administrative clutter and is inefficient, many larger or growing companies trend that way without clear efforts to stay 'lean'. Alternatively, it could be that the company recognizes the potential profits from a model of ongoing application support and maintenance. It is often more profitable to continue to develop client relationships and dependency on you then to make clients self-sufficient. One book that covers this idea of keeping businesses from developing more unneeded bureaucracy is ""The Lean Startup"".</p>

<p>Lastly, as far as a non-competition agreement goes you should consider talking with a lawyer. At least in some states in the US those agreements are often hard to enforce so you might be able to get around that year you are barred from making profits. Alternatively, you could spend that year actually developing a new product for customers.</p>

<p>Good luck! I hope this helps.</p>

The fact that you refuse your client's suggestions will complicate things. We don't know if you're right or wrong, because we don't have the story from the other side. <strong>Only a judge can tell you who wins, and it will be very time consuming and expensive</strong>.</p>

"Outsourcing and startups","233","","<p>I'm working for a fat startup (lots of cash) where the founders are former big-wing executives, with average 30 years of successful experience in the banking industry. They are used to outsource software development, writing a very detailed specification and hiring someone to build it.</p>

<p>I can't possibly convince them that this ""rocket launch"" approach is not the most suitable for startups (I tried, it is like preaching Darwinism to the Pope). For me it is total déjà vu (1990s all over again) from when I worked for startups before the first Internet Bubble - they used to operate like this, and all failed miserably.</p>

<p>But I was wondering if I'm biased: perhaps there are web startups that succeeded doing this. Do you know of any?</p>

<p>[update]</p>

<p>Product is a real estate marketplace, not really related to financial transactions or other strict/regulated field.</p>
","<p>If you can manage the project and the specs are detailed and follow quality control on incoming code or code committal, then there is nothing wrong with that. If the development work is going to be only for a short phase, it can make economic sense to outsource over keeping an in-house team even if the founding team was tech savvy. </p>

<p>As far as my understanding on the matter, outsourcing had nothing to do with the bubble. It was more to do with the lack of a viable monetizing plan and hype.</p>

<p>Some factors you should be considering are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Do you feel the development work to be continuous. It may make sense to keep a team on  hand if the work is a long homogenous project or you want continuous development/ rapid improvements to it after launch</li>
<li>Do you have the capability to create specs, monitor quality,  and manage the project. If you do not then you can hire a product/project manager to be on the team who can oversee the outsourcing process.</li>
<li>Would there be significant work for the in-house development team after the project is complete? You don't want to keep them idle, or lay them after 9 months given how much time and money you spent on recruiting them. </li>

<p><strong>False objections are just the things people say instead of buying.</strong> They often have logic, but that doesn't make them true. And until you probe further, you don't know if this is a sales issue (the prospect is bailing out, but this was a sale you could have made) or whether it's really a 'no'.</p>

<p>Your diagnostic question is something like this. <strong>""If I could offer you the service with some limitations with fixed fees below $$, would you go ahead?""</strong> If the wriggling just changes, stop wasting your time. But a ""yes"" tells you that perhaps there's a second market for you.</p>

<p>My pricing mantra is, <strong>the <em>right</em> price is the <em>highest effective</em> price</strong>. From what you've said, there's a significant market for you at the full price, and there are some negatives beyond pure revenue at lower price points, so you probably shouldn't be lowering your general pricing.</p>

<p>That leaves the possibility that you can construct an offering carrying different pricing, that will co-exist with your general pricing. We need to look at two cases.</p>

<p>The first case, which is excellent where it works out, is where you can <strong>offer a single product at multiple pricings</strong>. Often the best way to deliver this is to vary not just the headline price, but the price structure. The optimal outcome right-prices the service for each distinct group while minimising negative effects such as encouraging customers to ""downgrade.""</p>

<p>Beware taking prospect talk at face value, but for the purpose of illustration, here's a possible route.</p>

<p>You could offer a fixed cost at the ""under the supervisor's radar"" level, but with measured usage - number of uses, or hours of use, or data processes, or whatever you can sensibly track. Taking your support point (not unique to you - it's widely observed that customer who pay less ask for more!), you may also want to premium price support to these customers, or offer a significantly lower SLA. </p>

<p>If I'm experimenting with pricing like this, as a safety barrier I will generally look for a few ways to become mildly ""annoying"" without actually damaging the function. For instance, I might feature ""Economy Edition"" prominently in the UI and in output screens, files and logs; I might find some places where I can slow down the journey through the utility; I might expire sessions more aggressively. These tactics are about reinforcing two different ways different customer groups can be smart - by using a great tool that delivers real value and saves money; or by getting a huge (perceived) saving in exchange for some ongoing hassle.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, you have to carry that a step further, and <strong>offer distinct value propositions with distinct pricing</strong>. Doing this effectively means dissecting the use cases and the value drivers. I'll illustrate, but I'll have to make a assumptions where you should be using best data.</p>

<p>So you are indicating that your primary value driver is time saved. And you're also saying that the low-price prospects are, essentially, valuing their time differently. Let's say that core customers value time saved at $100/hour, economy customers at $10/hour. So on principle, if you offered a version of your SaaS that took more user-hours to drive, and took more elapsed time to deliver results, you could price at a fraction of the core product, while delivering best value to each group.</p>

<p>This is logical and attractive, but in my experience it's often unsustainable, for a variety of reasons. So I would normally try and work down through secondary value drivers. (This is hard work, but it does pay off.) You are looking for drivers that have relevance to each group, that are at least partly orthogonal, and that are as straightforward as possible to deliver differential service or/and pricing. </p>

<p>For mass-market services, this can get pretty subtle. But where what we're really doing is simply putting more distance between a high-priced and low-priced product, you can be crude. My rule of thumb is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the secondary driver is &lt;15% as important as the main driver, work on delivering the minimal acceptable service and no more for the secondary value prop, with zero optionality</p></li>
<li><p>If it's 15%-75%, it's a strong candidate to introduce as a second price lever - with (relative to base pricing) high additional fees for better service</p></li>
<li><p>If it's >75%, consider making it the lead element of the value prop as communicated online</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These techniques can be extremely powerful. But if you're at an early stage, I'll usually advise startups, especially if they're bootstrapping, to keep a tight focus on customers who are a better fit while the product is developing and you have a small team and a viable funnel. That said, I've seen a lot of startups fail to maximise their potential because they keep things simple too long!</p>

"How essential is it for (first) employees to get some share of the company?","232","","<p>When trying to found a startup where the goal is not an early exit, but the creation of a lasting company: How essential is it for (especially first) employees to get some share of the company? Are there any substitutions for sharing equity?</p>
","<p>There are a number of reasons why one might consider sharing the ownership of one's business with others:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>as exchange for something that you need (e.g. to obtain cash from an investor, or to obtain work from an employee whom you do not have the cash resources to pay in full);</p></li>
<li><p>to ensure that such people's incentives are aligned towards the same goals as your own; and</p></li>
<li><p>to ""lock"" people into longer-term commitments than they might otherwise consider (a person is less likely to quit a business in which they own stock than one in which they do not).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with anything, there is a trade-off: primarily, dilution of control and dilution of earnings.  Dilution of control might be avoided through a different class of stock (that carries reduced or no voting weight), but dilution of earnings is the means by which the above goals are accomplished (and therefore cannot be avoided).</p>

<p>A further consideration lies in the additional complexity of disengaging from one another should the relationship deteriorate in the future: it's therefore sensible to enter a clear written agreement between shareholders that sets out exactly what happens in the event of a dispute.</p>

<p>As to your specific questions, I assume that (rather than talking about ""business partners"" or ""cofounders"") you're talking about people who you have sought to recruit in the job market (and therefore about whom you know very little besides their application, resumé, references and interview):</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>How essential is it for (especially first) employees to get some share of the company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's only <em>essential</em> if your desired employees refuse to work for you without having a share of equity.</p>

<p>I'd generally caution that it's probably a bad idea to give a share of one's company to such employees outright.  It's very difficult, even for mature businesses, to identify which job applicants will ultimately turn out to be the very best employees.  Will they deliver on expectations?  Will they work well with the rest of the team?  Will they learn and grow in their role?  Will they share their knowledge and skills with others?  Will they add substantial value and contribute towards the company's success?  Will they still be working for the company in a year's time?  How about five years?</p>

<p>Moreover, what if you soon after have to recruit another employee into a similar (or even more senior) position?  They might well demand a similar (or even more significant) equity share.  Once the precedent has been set, it can be hard to escape.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Why is this so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because those prospective employees may perceive that they are capable of achieving a better deal elsewhere.  Be conscious of what remuneration packages similar businesses are offering for similar roles and be ready to spell out what differentiates you from them.</p>

<p>For example, a high-tech startup in Palo Alto looking to recruit a CTO with 10 years high-level managerial experience in relevant technologies might find it difficult to recruit a person of that calibre without offering an immediate equity stake; whereas a retail startup in Glasgow probably wouldn't find it too difficult to recruit a shop assistant without offering equity.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Can it be substituted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than granting equity outright, one might consider instead a <em>share option scheme</em> (under which the employee earns, over time, a right to buy shares from you&mdash;perhaps for some nominal, or even zero, amount).  One can specify the criteria necessary for their options to ""vest"" (e.g. the employee must deliver on certain targets, or remain employed for a certain period of time).  You will almost certainly require professional advice to set up such a scheme.</p>

<p>Alternatively, one could set out a clear bonus incentive, by which the employee is capable of earning substantial reward without sharing in the ownership of the company.  This is simpler and less costly to implement, but beware that it may not be as tax advantageous as equity-based rewards.</p></li>

  <p>(Appears YC values almost all of the companies they fund as being worth $1,714,285.71428, though it's possible I'm missing something.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you're missing is that investment is a numbers game. </p>

<p>YC don't think that all of the startups are worth the same amount. They invest time + knowledge + networking + $120k in many startups. Some of them will fail. Some will do okay-ish. A small number will do very, very, very well indeed. </p>

<p>YC make their money from that last subset.</p>

<p>If you go talk to anybody who has been on the YC programme they don't talk about the money being the valuable part. Indeed until recently it was a lot less that $120k. Folk on the YC programme talk about the people, the network, and the mentoring being what makes YC worthwhile to them. YC themselves say about half of the folk who they fund don't <em>need</em> the money.</p>

<p>$120 is probably about 3-12 months runway depending on the startup. That's what YC are giving them. Time. Time to prove their model and get the company into a state for possible future investment rounds. They're looking to get enough of their portfolio of companies to grow so that a few of those 7%s will pay for all the other just-okays and failures.</p>

"What are the responsibilities of a COO and a CFO in a startup?","231","","<p>And how do these roles differ from that of the CEO?</p>

<p>In terms of both responsibilities and work.</p>
","<p>That's completely dependant on the StartUp. </p>

<p>The COO normally <strong>runs</strong> and <strong>plans</strong> the environment of the operating business. Examples are Product Live Cycle or Service Blue Print. But also processes of how production works etc. He has concerns and financial needs, which the CFO (and other C-Level managers) needs to fulfill or reject. (How to we fulfill our offerings?)</p>

<p>The CFO takes care of financial streams through the company, takes care of current and future financial needs and develops an investment strategy. (Do we have the financial possibilities?)</p>

<p>The CEO is some kind of mediator in this relationship. He has to prioritize and set-up his on certain problems. He is the board leader and his main objective is that the company runs smoothly and do strategic decisions. (Does it fit into our strategic model?)</p>

<p>In a startup, the COO normally is represented by a specialist (Developer, industrial designer etc).</p>

<p>The CFO mostly doesn't exist. His tasks are partly taken over by the CEO and are outsourced. (Financial planning and investment strategy in-house, reporting and books outsourced)</p>

<p>In startups, those names (CFO, COO, CMO, CIO, CTO) aren't that important. Those are needed if the company has a lot of people, material, information, etc. to be managed.</p>

<p>StartUps should do a more lean approach. Focus on the needs of the customers, creating a product and do not over manage everything.</p>

<p>Of course, that's more or less an opinion and fits not all startups. I personally think, that the main difference between startups and companies are the terms of failure probabilities: managers try to reduce risks and do not accept uncertainties while entrepreneurs have to accept uncertainty and transform those into risk over time.</p>

<p>So if you think about to introduce a C-Level, think about how much uncertainty you can accept and how much management capacities you really need to manage your risks. At a certain point, a startup evolves and the needs for managers rises.</p>

<p>Difference risk and uncertainty: 
risk = 10% Good - 70% Okay - 20% Bad => You know about probabilities or at least can guess them with the information you have.
uncertainty = ?% Good - ?% Okay - ?% Bad => You know about the outcome, but you have no information about probabilities.</p>

"Easiest way for two people to get a mobile app off the ground","230","","<p>I talked out loud about an app I've wanted to build for a card game I play a lot, at a tournament of said card game, and one of the players was a fellow programmer who absolutely loved the idea. He first wanted to make an open source, free of charge solution but I made it clear that I want to be compensated for any work I put in which he eventually agreed to. We did not know each other at all before this discussion, and we've built a skeleton app and have booked our calendars for coding sessions.</p>

<p>Now, here's my question; if this would've been something I'd kept to myself, I would just code the app, release it and cash in but now that there's a guy who have the opportunity to screw me over here, it immediately looks more complicated to me. What's the easiest way to make sure that our respective shares of the revenue is protected from each other and that the ownership of the app is shared between us? This is just a hobby project for both of us and I don't think this idea has the potential to earn more than a couple thousand, but I'm putting valuable time into this and I want to know I'll get something back. We don't need any capital, only our expertise to get this thing running.</p>
","<p>The easiest -- and only -- way is to sign a contract. It's really as simple as that.</p>

<p>Cook up a contract whereby you're on revenue share for the app and call it a day. Or create a company together.</p>

<p>And don't worry too much about having shared your idea. If your partner is as passionate as you are, the last of his preoccupations will be to screw around with you. Work as a team. It's essential to your success.</p>

<p>If you don't actually want to work with the chap, on the other hand, tell him up front -- in a polite way. An idea is worthless without execution, and it's not obvious at all that he'd follow through with the idea without you. And even if he did, is it that much of a big deal?

<p>Do you know of any system where I can directly reach these industries? I doubt google ads will help either.</p>

<p>Is there really only way to use a salesperson for introducing my product?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>A few ideas off the top of my head:</p>

<p>Try running some Google ads on ""waiting list software"" and similar keywords that can be used to find a product such as yours.</p>

<p>While you research those keywords, additionally identify your competitors, and reverse-engineer whether and how they're approaching your target audiences. What sites mention your competitors (prompt them to mention you too)? Which forums mention your competitors (mention yours in the same threads)? Etc.</p>

<p>In the case of your audience, sending an ad by fax may also be an option. (Check that it's legal where you live before proceeding, as not all countries allow the practice.) Doctors invariably have a fax; so do most restaurants, hair dressers, and so forth. You can build a list by mining phone registries.</p>

<p>When I typed that keyword in, btw, the first Google suggestion was ""waiting list software free."" This may or may not be indicative that a significant chunk of your target audience will never pay for your software. If so, try to understand which subsegments reliably do pay, and touch base with a couple of them to know what specific feature or particularity lead them to do so -- implement it or make it clear in your marketing that they do.</p>

<p>As for your sales copy, your best bet is to head downtown and do a few meetings with your audience when they've some time to receive you. Tell them you're doing a market study for a cool app, and that you'd like their feedback on it. Don't be shy or fear rejection; most will accept to receive you. During the meeting, seek to identify what pain points they're having with waiting lists (if any) and, in the case of those who do not have software yet, whether they'd even consider software for it and at what price point.</p>

<p>Identifying the pain and getting a feel of much it costs the business is crucial, btw. You can then use the information both for your sales copy, and to determine the appropriate price point. It may turn out, for instance, that a non-equipped business might be losing a client per month or so. That seems trivial, but if that extra client would earn them and extra $50 or $200 per month, it can probably command a price which is much higher than what you expect. One that's possibly high enough to hand this to telesales.</p>

What should I push for, I own the IP of the whole code and I don't want to cause any differences among us by claiming that I need higher share than them.</p>
","<p>I advise <strong>against</strong> going for equal share in almost all cases, especially if you plan on raising money. Savvy investors know that not everyone contributes the same amount to a given product or team. In addition, if you have written up all the software, then determine precisely what each of your other cofounders are bringing to the table: domain expertise, their network, business experience, etc. Also keep in mind that an idea is actually <em>worthless</em>, so ""this is my idea"" is not a good basis for negotiations*.</p>

<p>From past experience, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend you settle on a shares agreement as soon as possible, as splitting shares is going to be the first fierce discussion you'll have within the team. This crucial step will also allow you to see whether the team can work together.</p>

<p>If you want a rough estimate on how the equity should be split, you can have a look at the following: <a href=""http://foundrs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">foundrs.com</a> . I have used this checklist as a negotiation basis in the past.</p>

<li>Market</li>

<p>Yes, team is there three times, because without an extremely solid team where everyone knows each other well, there is no way they can develop a product which will reach any market.</p>

<p>Of course, both agree on a very short feedback loop from the customer, in order to achieve a faster product market fit.</p>

<p>The question is purely about bugs and polishing.</p>

<p>According to your experience, does the presence of bugs / the polishing influence the product market fit?</p>

<p>Should I try one more A/B test or first fully debug and polish the previous one?</p>

<p>We programmers hate bugs, but maybe wrongfully so. Is there real-world data on this?</p>
","<p>Remember that bit in the Lean Startup, where Eric talks about his product IMVU and how the team learnt so much by bringing in a person who met the target demographic to test out the product? </p>

<p>That is a very cheap and quick way to get realistic feedback from people who would actually use the product. Invite people in the target demographic to a test session. Sign NDAs if necessary. Have the dev team <strong>observe</strong> how the user is trying to figure out and use the software (See if the user can do the whole process, download, install, configure, basic use, without instructions from you). Note the difficulties, bugs they encounter and fix them before release. Usually bugs discovered on such a preliminary round is going to affect the usability of the software. Sometimes devs worry about bugs needlessly. As Eric mentions in the book, some of the bugs they fretted over where not even discovered because they were deep in the levels that users normally don't go into in the early days. </p>

<p>Rule of the thumb is to ship functional products (if your product is augmented,then at least the MVP core of it should be functional). Do a closed door beta test. Even a small one with just one or two people unfamiliar with the system from the target market can teach you lots. Second, if the bugs are first or second layer or effects core functionality, you should take time and fix them or offer a work around. If the bugs are deep, have it in your bug log, prioritize and work on them. If you are nice, be ready with a known issues section on your website or in your documentation. </p>

My question is, if I build a machine to demo say a high end graphics design system, can i write this off as a business expense, assuming it's used 100% for the purposes of selling? If yes, is it best to use depreciated value over time or a lump value at the start? Thus far I am nearing a break even point but still operating in the red. thanks!</p>
","<p>This is more of an accounting question, so your best bet would be to speak with an accountant or ask your local tax authority. Usually they (tax authorities) have specific rules by which they decide what's allowed as current expenses and what is deemed to be capital expenses. In Canada, for example, in most cases they treat purchases below $200 as current expenses, subject to certain conditions. In your jurisdiction rules are likely different.</p>

<p>Based on that threshold you either write off your expense immediately or keep it as a capital asset (until you sell it) and write off its depreciation, again, according to your local rules for that type of an asset.</p>

<p>In some cases you might be able to record in your books the process of building a machine as a series of ""upgrades"", where each ""upgrade"" remains below the capital expense threshold. This could be risky, though, so I can't honestly suggest this approach.</p>

<p>I am not an accountant (but I have been in your situation).</p>

"How do I avoid getting bitten by copyright / patent trolls?","221","","<p>I'm a bit afraid of opening my own company. I have a great idea but it's hardly revolutionary. I'd rather not spend loads of money on lawyers or go broke early on if a patent already exists for my product, but I'm not sure how I can protect myself. </p>

<p>What steps can I take to stay safe from patent trolls, and does it matter what country I'm based in? Could I, for example, be sued in the UK for unintentionally infringing a US patent?</p>
","<p>THE US-based company answer: There is not much you can do to protect against trolls, but you are not necessarily the profile they will go after. They typically go after the bigger companies with big checkbooks that have a chance at settling for 6 figures because they will need to spend 7 figures on legal fees defending against them.</p>

<p>I would <strong>not let them scare you off</strong> from starting a company. At a certain point when you are getting traction you can revisit and consider filing your own patents to help provide some defense. USPTO has a 1-year grace period on filing but if you think you have something that is patentable it is probably worth doing a bit of the research.

"Solving the cold-start problem for a craigslist-like website?","221","","<p>I built a website where users can post free classified ads. Something like craigslist. Now since I want to launch it I'm not able to find good ways to market the website and make users use it.</p>

<p>I believe the website will be used and popular, but I'm suffering from the cold-start problem. In other words, when I will launch the website it won't have any postings on it because it's completely new! So how can I get users to use my website so I can have some content on it so the users can find it useful?</p>

<p>Creating fake ads might destroy the trust of the users or could even be illegal. So any alternatives?</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>posters on every notice board - send poster around the country to friends and family to post up.</p></li>
<li><p>most people won't ""just use your site"" because you talked to them - 
take a paper form and ask if they have anything to advertise right now- fill out the form and publish the ads yourself on their behalf.(make sure you have your own camera to take pics of the item)</p></li>
<li><p>tell all your friends to publish something even if its an old pair of shoes, old door knob... anything as a give away.</p></li>
<li><p>network with people in other states and countries to do the same - at ground level. </p></li>
<li><p>then repeat above, but target advertisers for paid subscription to advertise - say 12 months advertising for 10 bucks (with a 3 year lock in price guarantee - minimum signup 3 years ($30)<br>
offer 1/2 price if they advertise right now (have your paper form &amp; camera handy) - its good to get some commercial gear up. (I had a hotel advertise 20ish beds + they where giving the old linen away to charity - offered to do this myself - took the linen and advertise - ""drop off provided, charity only enquire."" 
and another resort had a couple of old snooker tables - be prepared to be a picker - load up the car with stuff 
and do deals - ""I'll take ya stuff now and drop off 70% of the sale later"" </p></li>

posters go out weekly. and a condition of advertising is now subscribing to email newsletter (of course users can opt out)</p>

"early access invite strategies","219","","<p>Many startups use an invitation system to manage the flow of users to their service. It seems like there are two different ways of implementing this. Some companies start off with a few invitations and give those first users a limited number of invitations to share. <a href=""https://ello.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ello</a> and Gmail used a system like this. <a href=""https://robinhood.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Robinhood</a> used an alternative strategy where you add yourself to the waiting list and can move up by inviting more people to join the waiting list. </p>

<p>It seems to me that Robinhood's strategy encourages users to spam invites and use fake emails, while people are more likely to be careful with their Gmail invites. What are other pros and cons to these systems. When does it make sense to use one or the other?</p>
","<p>An invite list is prone to fail in the event you don't have enough press attention, or if early adopters are underwhelmed by what you're showing them. It works based on the incentive that an eager user will crave to become one of the ""privileged few"" who get to use an <em>awesome</em> product, and then chat around hoping to locate someone who will be able to honor her with that privilege. If early reviews suggest that your product is underwhelming, there isn't much of a privilege in using it, and little chatter will result.</p>

<p>The benefits of a wait list over an it include that a) it tends to spread further, faster, and more virally; and b) it quickly pins down which of your market segments are most eager to use your product -- or at the very least those which are most eager to promote it.</p>

<p>A downside is indeed that these may end up promoting it to users who aren't really interested. You can work around this though: if you count invites closed rather than invites sent, or the invite closure <em>rate</em>, or the invites sent by invites, the incentive to randomly <s>email</s> spam is lower.</p>

<p>It can also be perceived as spammy. (""Just notify me when it's ready, thank you very much."")</p>

<p>Still, methinks a waiting list is the better approach if there's any potential for your product to be promoted virally (neither approach will work if it doesn't): it allows to build a larger list during a pre-launch, without needing too much press attention. Because upon signing up, there's little incentive to pass on (a fixed number of) invites in e.g. forum or a blog post, whereas there can be an incentive to mention it in the same location with a special signup link.</p>

<p>I should add (and this is something I've yet to see done atm) that there might be value in suggesting which types of users ought to be invited in terms of ""Users who [describe a problem you address here]"". When a user signs up, ask in which segment(s) she fits in, and leave her the possibility to add a custom answer (""I need it for something else"") to get additional market insights.</p>

"How to estimate the standard costs related to agreeing to YC's terms","215","","<p>Might be wrong, but the <a href=""http://blog.ycombinator.com/the-new-deal"" rel=""nofollow"">current standard deal at YC</a> appears to be based on the assumption that it's their position that the costs to implement the terms of the agreement are equal to the sum of the funds offered.</p>

<p>What are the common types of costs related to implementing the terms of the agreement, what is average amount that these costs might be expected to be per team member and/or team if a fixed costs per team, and how were these estimates reached?</p>
","<p>YC is not an investment firm, they are a business accelerator/incubator focusing on technology companies. A business incubator is a business which helps startups get started in return for a fee. In the case of YC, the fee is equity in the startup. The service they offer include cash (call it an investment but its actually designed to cover the living cost of the founders while they are getting their startup running), business planning, business lessons, networking,pitching, showcasing to investors, PR, helping with research and product development and market traction etc.</p>

<p>The startup would not be making an income in the early stage and the founder has to be working fulltime on it. The 'investment' is primarily designed to cover the living costs of the founder while he is building his start up and attending the incubator program. These can be normal living costs in the area where the incubator is located. This can be rent, utilities, groceries, health, transportation etc. The YC deal is the same regardless of the number of founders. You can use a calculator like the one here to compare the costs of living in the Bay Area to your own area <a href=""http://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/California-San-Francisco"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/California-San-Francisco</a></p>

<p>Since you have to give up equity, it would be worthwhile to assess what the future value of that equity might be. The YC standard deal takes 7% ownership of your startup. This is a significant portion of equity and 120k is not a big sum of money. YC plays it very safe by spreading a small investment over a large number of companies. Even if 1 out of 10,000 of the companies they invest in turns out to be big like the next facebook, they would be making significant return on their investment.</p>

<p>For example, 
120k (current standard YC deal) x 10,000 companies = they are out 1.2 billion diversified over 10,000 companies. 
Assuming dilution of 7% to 1% as further rounds of investment happens.
Taking FB as an example, with current market cap at 226B. 1% would be 2.2 B. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is likely to be series A preferred stock and their term sheet would give them the right to buy any new stock prorata as well. If your startup hits big like facebook and YC's 7% got diluted down to 0.1%, you could potentially be giving up $226 million in exchange for $120,000 and some services.</p>

"How does a rental business ensure rented product is returned?","214","","<p>There are businesses which provide books, electronic gadgets, musical instruments, apparels, etc. They generally charge a security deposit less than the cost of the product rented. There is a possibility a customer won't return a rented product. How do rental businesses avoid such theft?</p>
","<p>Loss is a common part of life for any business, rental or otherwise. Any store that puts products on shelves can expect some (hopefully small) amount to be shoplifted by a few dishonest persons. What allows businesses to succeed is the relatively large percentage of people who transact honestly without stealing. Unfortunately, a business's prices will have to reflect an allowance for theft so it's the good people who end up paying for the stolen products. Let me explain how this works.</p>

<p>Specific to rental businesses, each product rental should have a small amount factored into the price to pay for lost or stolen property. For example, if a business wants to rent widgets for $100 and they expect one in twenty to be stolen, they might add $5 (1/20 * $100) to the price to cover the stolen goods. This would make the rental price $105 ($100 + $5). The $5 represents a basic (self) insurance premium. Alternatively, a rental business might find another party (probably an insurance company) who will cover the losses. The insurance company might be able to offer a better value (let's say $4 premium per widget rental) because they might be better at going after the thieves in the legal system. In a lot of ways, buying insurance is like hiring a legal team to handle a very limited set of situations very well.</p>

<p>Finally, as mentioned by Dawny33, rental companies have a customer's information and can pursue legal action themselves or they might report negatively on a person's pubic records (credit report, etc). This negative reporting and legal action can end up warning other rental businesses about this customer. In the same way, positive reporting can encourage a rental company to deal good customers. The better a rental company can screen their customers, the less they have to set aside for loss, the more competitive (and successful) they can be in the marketplace.</p>

"Types of incentives for powerful crowdfunding","214","","<p>I am interested to learn what types of crowdfunding incentives can work well to entice potential supporters to donate. This is a general question about incentive strategies as opposed to specific to an individual project or cause.</p>

<p>To clarify - this Q&amp;A will be most useful if used to explore a variety of tactics specifically for converting shoppers in this last stage of the purchasing decision (to donate money to a project/business/cause etc.) on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter. So the best answers deal with tactics for this final point of conversion. </p>
","<p>There are far too many factors to give an exhaustive answer in Q&amp;A format. Key bits (there are many more):</p>

<p>Start by understanding that <strong>launching your crowdfunding campaign should be your <em>last</em> step in promoting it</strong>; not the first.</p>

<p>As such, <strong>identify the target audience and where it hangs out online <em>before</em> launching</strong> your crowdfunding campaign. This is key. Your entire execution will be a gazillion times more efficient if you do this properly.</p>

<p>Then <strong>build your list <em>before</em> launching</strong>. You want backers lined up and excited before you publish. In practical terms, this means building a landing page to feed a mailing list, and then drum-rolling the crowdfunding campaign by emailing your list when you're about to launch.</p>

<p><strong>Make a video</strong>. Campaigns that succeed without a video are rare. On that note, avoid common crowdfunding video mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should not look completely amateurish. If it's scratch-your-eyes out ugly and hopelessly boring, nobody will watch it.</li>
<li>It should not look <em>too</em> professional. If it does, backers may end up assuming you don't need any money. Slightly amateurish is fine.</li>
<li>Keep it short. 5 minutes is all you have. Make that 10 if it's super complicated.</li>
<li>Get to the point. Viewers should know what you're about or be intrigued enough to watch within 15 seconds tops. For the note, that's <em>enormous</em>: a TV commercial has roughly three seconds to pull you in.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Write good copy</strong>. Articulate the value you'll deliver and how your readers will benefit from the finished product. Keep in mind that customers seldom buy features, slogans, or credentials. They buy answers, benefits, and solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Pay attention to your headlines</strong>. Without good ones your copy won't stand a chance. Avoid words like ""help"", ""support"", or ""fund"" -- especially in the project's title. They can give the impression that a project is, in fact, a handout that is masquerading as something else.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, like VCs, <strong>backers don’t invest in ideas; they invest in people</strong>. Readers need to be reassured that your team has the drive and passion to execute. A good way to do that is to tell the project’s story. Bonus points for laying out potential conflicts and stakes: they make a story more engaging and compelling to share.</p>

<p><strong>Rewards must be desirable and fairly priced</strong>. To borrow an exquisite quote by <a href=""http://www.thedominoproject.com/2012/06/why-kickstarter-campaigns-fail.html"">Seth Godin</a>: ""If you give your tribe something to believe in as well as a reward that's easy to talk about, you've done two things right."" Speaking of which: it's ideal to <strong>check what kind of rewards potential backers might want <em>before</em> to starting your campaign</strong>.</p>

<p>Rewards typically include <strong>copies of the thing</strong> (e.g. the DVD), <strong>creative collaboration</strong> (e.g. the backer gets to write the backstory of one of its part), <strong>creative experiences</strong> (e.g. dinner with the cast), and <strong>creative mementos</strong> (e.g. appear in credits).</p>

<p><strong>$25, $50 and $100 rewards bring in the most</strong>. <strong>A reward under $10 helps go viral</strong>, as it provides a way for cash-starved students to get involved. When done right, <strong>a crazy expensive reward can make less expensive ones look like good deals</strong>; if it's outrageously overpriced, it'll backlash by chopping into your credibility.</p>

<p><strong>Create some exclusivity and scarcity</strong>. For instance, offer the $25 reward for only $20 to 100 early adopters. But beware of creating artificial scarcity in a way that can backlash. For instance, by disgruntling backers when a highly desirable reward is sold out -- especially once a campaign is fully funded.</p>

<p>There's somewhat inconclusive data that <strong>5-6 reward levels might be ideal</strong>. This is not counting the exclusive early adopter ones, and the basis would be that more reward levels confuse viewers.</p>

<p><strong>Beware of the logistics involved in shipping physical rewards</strong> as they can be overwhelming. Particularly if they're tied to a pledge of less than $25. Be sure to address international shipment details in the FAQ if you offer any.</p>

<p>Lastly, be sure to understand campaign dynamics: <strong>successful crowdfunding campaigns are often halfway there within the first day or two, seldom last more than 30 days</strong>. When a campaign is spread over more than a week, there's a mid-stage period where little progress is made. Have emails drafted in advance to keep backers excited and promoting.</p>

We paid for the cheapest plan (when it was already on sale), and then put effort in to message top-grade designers to 'come down to our low level competition' and we ended up getting over 120 designs paying the minimum package price (guaranteeing like 30).</p>

<p>But, your question seems to point towards other avenues. I think you should definitely start with your network. For me, I know a lot of people from college who are excellent designers, and sometimes it's just a favor you need to try and get from someone.</p>

<p>In general, I would say that designing something like a logo can be done rather quickly, given you have the concept. But remember -- designing a website or application design layer (which i don't think you are speaking towards) is extremely complex and time consuming (and is on a whole different level).</p>

<p>For alternatives, there are a lot of crowd-sourcing design competition websites out there (here's <a href=""http://www.designcrowd.com/crowdsourcing?gclid=CjwKEAjw68ufBRDt0Zmrn4W_8AwSJADcjp1cexXpJVTNGMtZU1iJhwTCJo25nZghxAqIYMcdZr-4dRoCxSHw_wcB"" rel=""nofollow"">one of the best rated</a> ones, although I loved 99designs), but I think you were looking at alternatives.</p>

<p>Other than crowd-sourcing, which I think is the <em>best</em> option, I would recommend:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Friends (chances are you know someone good with photoshop)</p></li>
<li><p>Do it yourself (not totally recommended, especially if you can't afford your own software). There's always software like <em><a href=""http://www.gimp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Gimp</a></em> to use for free, but if money isn't a problem I would recommend a tool like <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Adobe Photoshop</a> if you're interested in taking on a more serious role as a designer. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, I realize that you're looking to <em>find</em> a designer, but the reality is, if your budget is low, and you are having troubles with 99designs (maybe this is because of the budget), then you should just remember that it's not unheard of for startups to bootstrap by doing some of these tasks themselves. I still would recommend 99 designs or DesignCrowd any day.</p>

"Ui / UX Design Services Online Business (Narrowing Niche)","213","","<p>I'm looking of starting my Online Service Business for working for clients / people, who need UI / UX Designers Services. I'm thinking about it for like 2 months already (so I kind of stuck of ideas) and I don't know how to better present myself and my services online.</p>

<p>I'm thinking to build a website, where I could show my past UI / UX (so basically it's a portfolio page), also add my services and stuff like that (basic website to show myself to future clients). But after planning my website and my services I thought of idea of narrowing my services niche from Web and Mobile UiI / UX Designer to ONLY Mobile UI / UX Designer. Because I saw that I much more prefer designing for mobile, instead for Web.</p>

<p>Is it good to do this kind of stuff to only narrowing my services to Mobile UI / UX? I'm asking this question because I see a bunch of UI / UX Designers (as a solo or agency, or whatever) whose are doing a really broad type of services for clients (it includes BOTH WEB and Mobile Design).</p>

<p>Maybe I'm narrowing it too much?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>

<p>My main question:</p>

<p>IS IT A GOOD BUSINESS PLAN TO NARROW MY UI / UX DESIGN SERVICES TO ONLY DESIGNING FOR MOBILE? Basically, I want to do only mobile design services (as I said, it would include UI / UX design) and I want to remove Web design services from my offerings. </p>

<p>Hope this clears some things out. </p>
","<p>As a rule, <em>the narrower you pitch, the more you will resonate with customers</em> who want that one thing. If my lawn mower blades have blunted, I'm looking for mower blade sharpening, and someone who offers just that will be an earlier call than a service to sharpen anything.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I'd say you're not narrowing far enough. Tighten the focus to one type of project and one type of customer and you have a platform to learn. </p>

"Why was whatsapp valuation so high?","213","","<p>When looking at the figures of the valuation of the users, I am surprised of the high differences between the valuation of a whatsapp user (roughly 50$) against, say a viber user (roughly 3$, but I am not sure that these valuations took place at the same time).</p>

<p>How come these differences were so high ? These applications seem to gather the same data from the users, after all...</p>
","<p>Methinks you're not aware that you're comparing apples to oranges. When it comes to acquisitions, the only thing that counts is how big a check the buyer is willing to write. The rest - call it assets, fundamentals, whatever - is nothing short of cosmetic. It matters, of course, but the key is to understand that the same company can have <em>very</em> different valuations depending on the buyer.</p>

<p>In this case, Rakuten is a conglomerate with over 40 business lines. It's into just about everything online that you can think of: retail, travel agent, bank loans, brokerage, etc. By buying Viber, it's expanding in yet another business. Presumably, it's doing so with the aim of using augmented chat as a commercial platform for its other lines of business.</p>

<p>Facebook, in contrast, paid for a company that could have been part of its downfall:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chat is an essential part of social media platforms. Particularly on mobile, where chat apps are the ones that get opened most. It's where a lot of future hotness is going to happen. Expect a slew of developments in the coming years on chat-related apps as companies battle to effectively replace SMS. Apple gave a <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/13/apple-unveils-new-messages-app-features-in-ios-10/"" rel=""nofollow"">taste of what's coming</a> in iOS 10.</p></li>

That's usually not a good sign when you're a social media portal. When you lose the younger audience, you're well on your way to becoming the next MySpace.

<p>Put another way, on the one hand side you've a conglomerate that is investing in a new distribution channel for its other business lines, and on the other you've a company that is preemptively buying competitors to remain the relevant social media.</p>

<p>You can protect yourself with an IP clause and a non-compete clause in your agreement with them.</p>

<p>But frankly, the best way to not get your idea stolen is to bring something to the table. When faced with what is commonly referred to as ""an idea guy"", a great developer will often ask him- or herself: ""can do, but what do <em>you</em> bring to the table?"" If the answer is unclear then it's indeed tempting to make do without you. If you demonstrate that you're bringing in proper market insights, domain expertise, administrative skills, a proper sales strategy, and clients, you're well on your way to being viewed as useful to the project.</p>

","<blockquote>

<ol>
<li>This is where a customer survey can come in. I take it you didn't do an open Beta test? This is something that you approach potential customers with, do a presentation, and say at the end ""how much would something like this be worth to you?"". If you did a beta test, your beta testers could answer this, otherwise you are going to have to cold-call or do some marketing.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The service has not been tested in a real corporate environment so I am afraid the software might fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>This is a failing in your software development methodology, not a startup issue. Being a software developer I know you can test these things. You can stress test web applications and write unit/functional/integration tests for the rest of it. I'd start doing some testing now.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not know how to create packages and price plans for my service.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>This depends on what you are offering and how you wrote the software. The software needs to support the idea of packages and pricing. Usually they limit the amount of access, features, or data depending on the subscription level.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not know if people will actually buy this service from me. This service is very important to companies but they wont die without it.</p>

<li>A market survey or canvasing potential customers can answer this question for you.</li>

</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not know if I need funding and if I do where can I get funding?</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li>Unless you have viral growth or slow sustained growth, you will probably need some sort of funding. As to where to get it, thats difficult to answer. The short answer is small business loans or family members. The longer answer involves getting investors involved but is the subject of entire books and too long to answer here.</li>
</ol>

<li>Depends on what you are offering, since you didn't provide details, its impossible to say.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>How will my client pay me? Bank transfers? Do I need to send them a bill?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""8"">
<li>Again, hard to say. Depending on the price you can set up recurring billing through any number of online payment gateways. Usually you do provide an invoice, usually electronically.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have so many different versions of the product in anticipation of clients different needs. Is this ok or should I stick to just one version?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""9"">
<li>As a developer, the fewer versions you have the better. Even if the client doesn't use a particular feature, its easier to have one product version than many. But don't put time into a feature that a minority of clients will use, its not worth it. </li>
</ol>

"Selling software as an individual","211","","<p>I am a software developer who will be starting college in about a month. I have written a program that allows racing organizations to run their races easier and more efficiently. I have organizations asking me when am I ready to sell it, when can we buy it, ect. The interest is there, I just need help with the next part, selling it.</p>

<p>Since this is a one-off product can I sell the product online in my own name with my own personal bank account? I don't think I have the time right now to start an LLC, nor do I want to tie a business name to the product. If I understand correctly, I just need to keep good records of my expenses, which I have been doing, and that should make the Tax process easier.</p>
","<p>Congrats on your success so far. It's great that you're able to get so far being as young as you are.</p>

<p>To answer your basic question, <strong>yes</strong>, you can sell it under your own name using your own bank account. Every person has the right to act as a sole proprietor (aka ""sole trader"" in some countries). The reason people form corporations, LLCs, limited partnerships, and similar liability-limited structures is to protect their personal assets in case something goes wrong. You see, we live in a very litigious culture where people sue each other for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons. Getting bogged down in legal battles and the potential for a personal bankruptcy are definitely not in your interest at this point in time.</p>

<p>Just to give a (hypothetical) example: Let's say one of your customers is using your software to run their racing business. Let's say that one day something goes wrong (maybe it's your fault, maybe it's not) and they lose all their data. They can try to blame you for the trouble and they can try to get you to pay them for their losses through a lawsuit. If you sold the software using a corporation or LLC, they can only go after the corporation or LLC -- they can't go after you personally. If you lose, the corporation or LLC can go bankrupt and it stops there, nothing can happen to you personally. On the other hand, if you sell your software personally and you lose the lawsuit, you may have to personally go into bankruptcy and that's not a good place to be, especially when you're just starting out in the world.</p>

<p>So even though you can sell the software yourself, it's probably not a good idea. And while it's possible nothing bad will happen, you can never know for sure.</p>

<p>The one other very important thing you need to know is software is almost always <em>licensed</em>, not <em>sold</em>. To license software means you let someone use a copy in a certain limited way. To sell software means you give them ownership. The owner of the software can do anything they want with it including selling copies or even telling you (the seller) to stop selling copies. So software needs to be licensed and that means you need a solid contract (usually called a ""user agreement"" or similar). You have to make them agree to the contract which makes it clear they only get to use it, can't resell it, and can't do many other things not in your interest.</p>

<p>So not only do you need to worry about liability in a lawsuit, you need to make sure you have a solid contract to which your buyers must agree.</p>

<p>You'll hear a lot of people online saying forming an LLC is easy and you can just do it yourself. That's true, just about anyone can form an LLC by filling out a form and sending money. However, unless you have a strong background in corporate law, it's probably not a good idea. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people (and governments) making millions of dollars in fees on this stuff and they don't care what ends up happening to you. Corporations and LLCs are great, but you <em>must</em> follow the correct procedures to form them and must keep following the correct procedures over time. If you don't a judge can easily remove the liability protection you might otherwise be provided and someone will be able to go after you personally, even though you had a corporation or LLC sell the software.</p>

<p>So what I'm ultimately getting at is: you need a lawyer. You need the lawyer to help you pick the correct business structure for your needs, you need the lawyer to help you put together a licensing agreement, and you need the lawyer to help you know how to stay safe in our litigious world. If you want to get a head start (and probably lower your legal expenses), there are lots of great books (check out publishers like Nolo) that can give you a good foundation. You can also study other software agreements and put together a rough version of what you want. But in the end, you should have a professional make sure you have everything correct.</p>

<p>Ask around and see if you can't find an attorney who will give you a break based on your age. Maybe you can even work out a deal to pay over time (especially if you have strong expectations for revenue from your software). Everyone, no matter how successful, was young once and remembers their first venture. Take advantage of the sympathy people may have and use it to get your business going. (Then one day, help out someone else in the same way.) Just keep trying, asking, and you'll eventually find a way to make this happen. Or if you are from a financially comfortable family, just tell them to give you some money.</p>

<p>Just don't try selling your software as an individual. It's just too risky.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

"When should an entrepreneur choose (or not choose) to use an 83(b) election?","211","","<p>I've been doing a fair amount of research, trying to get opinions from different sources. As a startup co-founder, one of my goals has been to play my taxes legally and ethically, but also responsibly. </p>

<p>Playing the ""tax game"" is clearly something that can determine how much money we pay in early stages, when we get bought out, etc., therefore I believe it is valuable to consider if and when I should write this letter to the IRS (I am American).</p>

<p>I understand that the letter must be written in 30 days, and I understand what it is, essentially (the ability to pay taxes par value at present date, rather than the taxes of the shares when we sell out). For those who don't know, <a href=""http://ayrlaw.com/what-is-an-83b-election-and-when-do-i-make-it-part-1-with-graphic/"">they are described here</a>.</p>

<p>However, my best business adviser (has sold companies for personal gains upwards of $50m) recommended we stay away from the 83(b) election for the sake of making trades and seeing big drops in stock prices, and still having to pay the tax based on the old, higher share price.</p>

<p>After reading, it seems like it's always a good thing (but my adviser clearly advised against this). I think a good answer to this question would adequately list when a business would consciously make the decision <em>not to enroll</em> and <strong><em>why</strong> they chose not</em> to enroll.</p>

<p>In short, and to make sure I don't get opinionated responses, can we limit this to factual relationships between scenarios where a business <em>would</em> and <em>would not</em> enroll in the 83(b) election.</p>
","<p>The article to which you have linked sums up the pros and cons quite well, giving examples of situations in which making an election might be wise and unwise.  If the stock rises in value between being granted and vesting (and assuming your marginal rate of income tax does not change in the interim), you'll pay less <em>nominal</em> tax by making an election; if it falls in value, you'll pay less <em>nominal</em> tax by not making an election.</p>

<p>Of course, nominal tax is only one part of the story: you also need to <em>finance</em> the assessed tax, and money has a time-value.  In general, it is worth settling future liabilities based on present values if and only if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you have cash available to pay today's settlement; <strong>and</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the liability is expected to grow faster than the (net) return you would receive for investing that cash elsewhere.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>income tax liability</em> will grow at the same rate as the stock's value (and therefore the question is whether you can grow cash faster than your stock&mdash;given that one way of investing your cash could be to buy further stock, this may not be all that unlikely).  The growth in <em>capital gains liability</em> is more complicated, as it depends not only on the rate at which the stock rises in value but also on the vesting schedule.</p>

<p>If the grant has negligible value (as will be the case with most startups), then the required cash is minimal (and so too would be any investment returns).  In such a case, you pretty much have nothing to lose by immediately settling the future tax liability (at almost nil value).</p>

<p>However, if the grant has some non-negligible value, the time-value of money can have quite a significant effect.  There are too many variables to give a generic answer, as one would need to compare the difference between cash investment return and stock growth rate with the capital gains benefit that would be derived from the vesting schedule.</p>

I also liked <strong>4 Hour Work Week</strong>. However, they both <strong>strongly underestimate</strong> the amount of work and time needed to be successful. It's much harder than those authors claim, but unlike others, they give practical advice, IMHO.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of reading- <strong>start hanging out with a local startup incubator and go to startup meetups on Meetup.com</strong>. Every year, business advice, and how startups are funded, changes <strong><em>a lot</em></strong>. I'll explain below:</p></li>
<li>I have found that business people and startup guys who rely on books over physically engaging the startup/business community are the worst off. And, they come with outdated concepts.</li>
<li>However, if I had to recommend a learning resource, I'd recommend anything published in the past 2 years, no later, by someone who personally founded a similar business to yours. (No professors, managers, investors, employees.) This will be hard to find, but worth it.</li>
<li>Beware of outdated business books, and outdated business <em>people</em>. Business has changed drastically in last 10 years.</li>
<li>Even in tech, the landscape changes every few years. So, a book written 4 years ago needs to be taken with a grain of salt. For example, in 2010, banner ads produced no results, so the advice would have been: Don't advertise with banners. Then, in 2012, thanks to retargeting, banners became very effective. This, of course, can change.</li>
<li>Startup strategies change and improve every year. Right now, I'd say incubators are the best way to launch. (And, getting into one is basically the best way to see if you have a good business going.) However, with incubators now jam-packed with applicants, I could see this changing in the next 10 years.. Top incubators typically accept startups with lots of momentum already.</li>

<p>A small item of clarity, which someone will pick up on, We have two classes of shares, Class A (voting) shares owned by my business partner and I, and class B (non voting) shares owned by our employees.

<p>Sharing the idea means you don't get 100% ownership of it, but it does increase your chances of actually getting your idea on the market before someone else does. It also allows you to focus on what you do really well, in your case software, and the other guy on hardware.</p>

<p>Keeping your idea means you get 100% ownership of the idea, but it doesn't increase your chances in actually getting the idea to market. You'll have to divide your time between software design, software development, learning hardware, hardware design, and eventually hardware development.</p>

"When does a lead become a Marketing Qualified Lead?","208","","<p>When does a normal lead become a ""Marketing Qualified Lead""?</p>

<p>I am a data scientist trying to understand the way lead scoring is done. So, can someone give a simple explanation on how the above process is done?</p>

<p>I the scoring process/mechanism company dependant?</p>
","<p><strong>Marketing qualified leads (MQL)</strong> are potential customers who have expressed more interest in your product than other prospects. An MQL <strong>is by no means someone who is guaranteed to buy</strong> your product. </p>

<p>In fact, you may find after further exploration that several of your MQLs are not good fits for your product and your sales team should waste no time on them.</p>

<p>MQLs could come from several ways, like filling a contact form on your website, talking to you on an event, calling your company asking more info about your product, clicking on a link in an e-mail campaign,  etc...</p>

<p><strong>Explaining the ""hierarchy""</strong></p>

<p>So, before MQL, you have the..</p>

<p><strong>Leads</strong> - They're essentially worthless.. are individuals/companies around the world who do not even care you exist.</p>

<p><strong>MQL - Marketing Qualified Leads</strong> - Already explained.</p>

<p><strong>SAL - Sales Accepted Lead</strong> - are leads that are ripe for sales interaction. They've not only shown an interest in your product, but have shown interest in <strong>getting</strong> your product.</p>

<p>Moving on in the sales cycle, your SAL will become SQL. </p>

<p><strong>SQL - Sales Qualified Leads</strong> - An SQL has displayed intent to buy a company's products and has met an organization's lead qualification criteria that determine whether a buyer is a right fit. </p>

<p>The label is applied to a prospect that has gone past the engagement stage and is ready to be pursued for conversion into a full-fledged customer.</p>

<p>Like our friend <em>@Andrius</em> has already mentioned, you could use the <strong>BANT</strong> approach in order to properly qualify a lead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>B</strong>udget: do they have enough money to buy the product?</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>uthority: can they make a purchase decision?</li>
  <li><strong>N</strong>eed: do they have a need that the product or service in question can fulfil</li>
  <li><strong>T</strong>imescale: do they have a specific time when they wish to make their purchase</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Once in the sales cycle, leads will, at least hopefully, then be converted into an <strong>Opportunity</strong> and finnally into a <strong>Closed Won</strong> deal (customer).</p>

"How to get international financing/loan/investment for working business","206","","<p>It is two years since I started a company for issuing online payday loans, and it is working really well bringing back nice profit which I put all back in business. So far it was all my or my family money and now they are obviously not enough.</p>

<p>I don't want to stop growth of my business and I am looking to attract investments. The perfect would be getting credit line 50-250 thousand euro initially for which we can simply pay something around 24% annually.</p>

<p>When I go to my local bank, they ask me only whether I can place a guarantee of real estate, and when I say no (as the company doesn't own any real estate), they dont want to continue.</p>

<p>In European Union such rate would be fantastic for banks as they issue business loans for half of it, but here in Georgia I can't reach them, or at least I don't know how or whom should I contact.</p>

<p>How can I attract capital in my described conditions? I am ready to provide any documentation/information/data, including most internal financial data, my tax declarations, bank account extractions, etc.</p>
","<p>What is your sales volume and what is your profit percentage? Have you included any amount for your personal (wage) expense in your profit calculation? Of your profit, what percent do you put back into the business? These are the questions anyone evaluating your business would ask. For a banker, his question would be what is your cash on cash rate of return? And how quickly can I get my money back? If it is not big and fast, it will be difficult to find any banker or any investor to loan you money. Not only that, but international loans are risky for many reasons, so if you do not have a physical location where the bank is, most are not going to lend to you.</p>

<p>If it is as profitable as you say, let it grow itself for a while. Two years for a startup is not a very long period. Since you do not have a software or internet company, it will take a bit of time to grow. </p>

<p>Also, as previously said, payday lenders do not have a positive reputation. Most banks do not want to tarnish their reputation by lending to such a  business. Your best bet is not to get greedy and take your time to grow a solid stable profitable company. If the business market is as large as you say, it is not going away. As your company grows so does your cash. </p>

"Suing developer for breach of contract","205","","<p>We hired a developer to finish a component of our App for ~15K, however, instead of taking 3 months, it has taken 8 months and still isn't complete.  Not only that, they are refusing to continue working on the app or releasing the code fully commented and detailed. They are now contracting with another client and state they have no time, yet, we are out thousands of dollars.  By email, and message, it was stated the project would be completed multiple times months ago, so we kept paying the developer in order to hit that timeline.  In California, by UETA rules all digital communications are binding and superseding of the original contract if the original contract does not state the opposite.  </p>

<p>What can we do? Can we sue? Can we recover the full amount of expense? What has been the communities experience with this type of situation? </p>

<p>Devon</p>
","<p>Devon:</p>

<p>So sorry to hear your news.  I think we have all been there in one way or another.  I am a lawyer in Canada but I have spent the last 20 years as a Co-Founder in tech startups so I have a lot of experience hiring freelance developers.  As you probably know going to court is very expensive and not really practical unless you have a huge claim.  Although most claims settle before they go to court, you will still spend a lot of money on legal fees.  (I have many colleagues who are litigators).  In Canada we have the option of Small Claims Court but you will still incur legal fees because it is not really practical to represent yourself.</p>

<p>It is understandable that you are annoyed and want to get redress but you have to keep your eye on the prize which is your code.  All of this legal stuff will simply complicate your life and cause huge delays.  And it sounds like you don't want to wait forever for your code which is what will happen if you go the legal route.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to be as nice as possible to the developer and get what you can from them.  If it becomes apparent that the chances of getting fully commented code are slim to none then you have to stomach your losses and take what you can get.  At least that way, you can move ahead with your project.</p>

<p>I realize this is not ideal but as a litigator friend of mine says even if you sue for a glass of water you won't get the whole glass of water back.  You will get some part of it.  That's the reality.</p>

<p>In future, I would structure your contracts so that you break the project into pieces with instalment payments to be made upon completion of each component. You also need to define what is expected (e.g. fully commented, working source code) and the project timeline.  As an extra incentive you may have a penalty for late delivery (Haven't had to do this before but it's an idea). That way the developer knows upfront that they won't get paid unless they deliver the fully commented code.  You also lessen your risk.  If the developer does not deliver as expected on the first component you can cut your losses and your project will still be salvageable.  Also make sure you have good termination provisions so if it becomes obvious that the person is not performing you can get out early.</p>

<p>In the end, you have to learn to trust your gut instincts.  If the developer is a pain from the beginning they will probably be that way throughout.  Before you engage a new developer on a long term project you should really try them out on a small project to see how you work together.</p>

<p>I'm sure this is not what you want to hear, but I am sharing my practical experience with you and please do not take any of this answer as ""official legal advice"" because it is not. </p>

<p>As much as it hurts, consider this experience to be part of your education.  It's cheaper than university tuition :)</p>

<p>Hope it all works out for you.  Don't give up.  Re-group and figure out how you can move forward and get your App done.</p>

"Using free/open source software in my own app","205","","<p>I am creating a web app which uses <a href=""https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">W3C/Google Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech</a> (<a href=""https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Demo of their technology here</a>). I shared the progress with some developers who mentioned I should be wary of the acceptable use policy.</p>

<p>I plan on monetizing my app at some point, and am worried that using this W3C/Google technology I will be relinquishing some rights to my own software... or will be forced to make it open source or something.</p>

<p>On the W3C specs page, (<a href=""https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html</a>), there is a ""Status Of This Document"" section, which has links to the Final Specification Agreement (www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/), but they state ""It is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track"", so am not sure if those rules apply?</p>

<p>The W3C document also provides no references back to Google, so I am unsure if there are some Google agreements I may be implicitly agreeing to.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> What implicit usage rules are typical in free software, especially software that is collaborated on between 2 or more groups/companies. For example, I wasn't able to find a ""Google &amp; W3C Terms and Conditions for Speech Technology"" doc.</p>

<p>I just find it hard to believe that so much work went in to creating their speech technology (recording narrations, algorithms for understanding/interpreting speech, etc), that I wouldn't be giving up some rights by using their software. </p>

<p>I'd just like to fully understand what I am agreeing to by using this.</p>
","<p>What you've linked to there is a specification document for a feature that may be supported by HTML5 user-agents (and which is <em>currently</em> <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition"" rel=""nofollow"">only supported by Chrome and Opera</a>; as of October 2015).  It is not, in itself, free software or an implementation of any software, API, or SDK (free or otherwise).</p>

<p>So it's not clear what ""free software"" you're referring to.  If your webapp is simply calling into the browser's speech API's, you really don't need to worry about anything.  There are no more caveats associated with referencing the <code>SpeechSynthesisUtterance</code> class than there are with using the <code>canvas</code> API or <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tags, or any other part of the HTML5/ECMAScript spec.    </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you're pulling in third-party libraries/code to interface with the browser's speech API (or to implement your own speech solution based upon the W3C spec), then you'll have to check the license terms that apply to each third-party library/bit of code that you're using.  </p>

<p>So to answer your specific question:</p>

<p><strong>What implicit usage rules are typical in free software?</strong></p>

<p>There aren't any.  Software developers set <em>explicit</em> usage rules in their licensing/distribution terms.  You need to check the license terms that pertain to the <em>specific</em> bit of free software that you're using, and ensure that they're suitable for your use-case (a lawyer can help with this).  </p>

<p>There are a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses"" rel=""nofollow"">wide variety</a> of different free/open-source software licenses out there, and you can't assume anything about whether you can/cannot use a particular piece of ""free"" software without first checking its license terms.  </p>

<p>As a <em>general</em> rule, any software that is <strong>permissively</strong> licensed is safe to use, including for commercial purposes.  Keep in mind, however, that some permissive licenses still require that you give attribution to the original developer.  </p>

<p>Bottom line; it's always best to check the actual license terms and make sure they work for you.  There are a wide range of ""free"" software licenses in use today, some of which are fine for commercial purposes, others which definitely are not.</p>

"Is there a way to retain the rights of something you show someone without using an NDA?","204","","<p>This might be a stupid question. Is there a way to send someone, who wouldn't know you, a packet of information (thru email) for them to review to see if they're interested in the pitch?</p>

<p>My problem is I know NDA's (Non-disclosure Agreements) usually have to be signed and exchanged to retain intellectual property rights (IP).</p>

<p>However, if I'm just sending NDA's for people to sign, printing and signing and scanning and emailing back is never fun, especially when they don't even know what I'm pitching yet. Is there any way to send someone the info without just giving away my rights for them to steal the idea?</p>
","<p>Sadly, no, the law does not recognize ""please don't tell"" as a viable form of IP protection.</p>

<p>Given that, your best option is, as I suspect you know, to get a patent. If you're tight on cash, you could just go for a provisional application (which is generally pretty cheap to get). That will only last a year, but it gives you a filing date so if you then decide over that year that there is interest in your invention, you can get a non-provisional (what most people think of when they think of a patent).</p>

<p>Aside from that, and this is really just a guess, I know there are several types of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature#Legal_definitions"">electronic signatures</a> that are actually accepted by branches of the government. For example, the <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/sigexamples_alt_text.pdf"">patent office accepts</a> ""/full name/"" as an acceptable form of signature. Again, this is just a shot in the dark, but it's conceivable that some jurisdictions might accept a similar form on an NDA. It's possible that another reader will know, or you could consult an attorney in your area. I bring this up, of course, in response to your complaints about having to scan signatures. I know that can be a hassle, so this could at least get you around that particular woe.</p>

<p>But long story short, no, you'll need <em>some</em> form of concrete protection or else it will certainly qualify as a public disclosure, and (dependent on jurisdiction) you could lose rights to your intellectual property.</p>

"Most important skill as a founder?","204","","<p>I have the following situation. We have a product which is still in development and we have funding and an environment at an university for that.

<li>Managing people</li>

<li>System Analyst</li>
<li>Marketing</li>

</ul>

<p>Do take note, on my personal level: I always had this question while building the startup:</p>

<blockquote>

"Thinking about start-ups as a graduate student","202","","<p>My PI recently told me that all the work that I do as a graduate student ultimately belongs to the university.  As such, is it even worth thinking about launching a startup while still a graduate student (or will that startup just become a spinoff of the PI and the university)?  I am afraid that launching a startup as a graduate student will only benefit the PI (and the university), as graduate students are usually on the lower rung of the academic social ladder and frequently get sleighted in a variety of ways.  </p>

<p>They say that it never hurts to plan for the future (i.e., what to do after graduation), but there's a fine line between casually thinking about it and actively pursuing it.  In other words, I don't see the point in actively putting in my regular work hours pursuing my startup idea if all of that work will not belong to me anyway once I graduate and pursue the startup full-time.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have a different opinion on the matter?</p>

<p>The only relevant post I found was: <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/5741/creating-startup-company-as-a-student"">Creating startup company as a student</a> but this is a substantially different question.  </p>
","<p>Many Universities have a policy of your work product is the property of school.  Same policy with professors.  Pretty much any company is going to have policy of your work product on company time and or company facilities belongs to the company.  </p>

<p>That policy / contract does not expire the day you graduate.
If this startup is related to you graduate work then using that work product (especially intellectual property) after you graduate is no relief.</p>

<p>If this idea is not related to graduate studies then simple don't work on it on school time or use school facilities.  If this product is an extension to your studies then you need consult and IP lawyer.</p>

<p>Say your studies are X and you think Y is commercial extension.  </p>

<ul>
<li>One thing you could do is go to University with Y and try and negotiate partial ownership of Y.  At best you are going to get a piece.  If you don't need the University for Y then no reason to go down this path.  </li>
<li>Pursue Y on your own time.  Don't use University facilities.  Don't ask you professor about Y.  Even be careful about asking other students about Y.  If you can get your graduate degree based on X then do your best to separate X from Y.  Lets say you do Y on your own time - don't put it in graduate thesis.  You don't need a formal start up to pursue Y on your own time.  You don't even need start up to file for a patent.  Why do you need a formal startup at this time? Timing of the startup is not likely to make any difference.  Even with all that Y may not be your property.  Consult an IP attorney.  Do what you can to not put Y at risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Update based on comment:<br>
Sorry to be so direct but a startup is not instant access to funds / investors.  You are going be at least $1000 to even create the legal entity and from there you have to attract investors.  If the startup is not viable enough for even you to work for the start up then you don't have a start up.  A start up has a business plan that produces income.  All you are tying to do is protect some IP and you are ready to file for a patent?  The patent alone has no value unless you are using it produce something or someone wants to buy the patent.  Are you worried that someone else will come up with the idea and patent it?  You can file for provisional patent yourself for just couple hundred dollars and give you (some) protection for a year.  You can then sell your patent without having a formal company.   You can spend $20,000 to lock up a patent but don't do that unless you are pretty sure you can sell it for $60,000 as the investor will want 1/2 and it not going to be interested in anything less than a return of 100%.  Say you think the patent is worth $20,000.  Someone is more likely to buy fair than to try and steal it. It cost money to steal it it puts them at risk.</p>

<p>TL;DR: It sounds like you're currently somewhere between late founder and an employee. It's not clear whether you're best described like one or the other - only you can judge which best describes you. At any rate though, if you feel you should be a founder, then by all means get a founder's share of equity - which 1-2.5% is not - for taking so much risk. If you feel you're an employee, then <strong>get paid properly</strong> because you won't recoup your opportunity loss if the startup goes downhill, and keep in mind that you should see equity as a bonus. Either way <strong>get things in writing</strong>.</p>

<p>If all else fails, don't miss that your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BATNA</a> is you going to work at another company that pays you properly. As you negotiate, keep in mind that you owe nothing  to the founders. Don't stick a gun to their face saying ""pay me or else"" of course, but you hopefully get the point: you've been accepting a low pay for months and without any agreement in place with respect to equity.

"Monetizing: why some company ask for high prices for their software?","201","","<p>The prices of software space a lot: from 1€ on markets like Google Play to 35$ of software like DisplayFusion, RegexBuddy, PowerGrep, Evernote going to some hundreds of euro (Resharper, Ndepend) and arriving to some thousand of euro (Toad, Visual Studio Ultimate).</p>

<p>In economy we study that it's not only a matter of costs of research and production. The pricing of products can be regulated by the Marshallian and Walrasian model of pricing.</p>

<p>However my knowledge of economy are very limited and I wonder if it could be a winning choice for small companies like the one which sell DisplayFusion, RegexBuddy and so on to sell their products for very cheap prices. Especially to private customers.</p>
","<p>Realistically, this question has no answer. There are so many factors that play into this that there is no answer for a general ""small company"". What companies try to do is find where the supply and demand curve intersect, so that they can make the most profit. Think of it this way:</p>

<p>Suppose DisplayFusion were to sell their product for $1, 100 people would be willing to buy it at that price. If DisplayFusion were to sell their product at $35, 3 people would be willing to buy it at that price. Which price should they sell the product at?</p>

<p>With no other factors coming into play, they should sell their product for $35 since they will make an extra $5.</p>

<p>However, many other factors can play into pricing. Take for example iPhones. Not only does Apple make money off of selling the iPhone, but the also make money off of people buying the apps for the iPhone. In this case, widespread adoption can be more important than the original profit from buying the iPhone; a larger user base makes it more likely that more people will buy more apps and therefore make Apple more money.</p>

<p>There are <strong>MANY</strong> other factors that will also play into pricing (such as marketing, competitor pricing, cost of production, etc.).</p>

<p>As you can see. There is no clear cut way to answer this question by saying anything other than ""It depends what will make the company more money"". Figuring out pricing is one of the most difficult parts of business.</p>

"Turning a class project into a startup: who owns what?","200","","<p>My friends and I in college had to design an idea for a product that addresses a certain problem in society. We chose a topic and designed a solution that I believe would be pretty marketable. In other words, we had a startup idea.</p>

<p>From there, we developed a non-functional prototype- just a series of pictures that show the application's logical flow and features. We did not code any software/application, but made a neat presentation that we showed to our instructors. No contracts were ever signed.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the project, we thought about maybe furthering it, but ultimately nothing came out of that. We haven't gotten together in 2 years. </p>

<p>If I'd like to further the idea, are my former classmates entitled to anything?</p>
","<p>Each university will have its own guidelines for intellectual property.</p>

<p>As a student (particularly as an undergraduate), your project is not <em>work for hire</em> because you are the one paying the university. If anyone involved in the work is being paid by the university to perform the work, then the rights become clouded.</p>

<p>Most universities have a Tech Transfer office that can clear up some of these issues, but keep in mind that they are acting in the university's interests, not yours. Speak with your instructor and possibly arrange to speak with the department - they may be able to simply sign off ownership, sometimes it is just that easy. If your startup is successful, the last thing you need is to run into IP issues down the road. These problems can kill fledgeling companies by incurring large legal fees.</p>

"Hiring developers from different countries","198","","<p>I have a startup idea that I want to hire developers with specific expertise. However, I can't find such developers in my country, so I need to hire developers remotely.</p>

<p>One of my greatest fears is that when the application is ready for production, the developer can 'steal' the code and use it himself and make it better to compete against me. Because the app isn't known to people yet, and because we are working from two different countries I think that I might not be able to do anything.</p>

<p>Am I right? If so how do I solve such problem?</p>
","<p>I raised hundreds of thousands at 19. Kept my idea so secret my girlfriend didn't know until 15 months into our relationship. I have 6 partners. We blew $100K+ with two tech-shops.</p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p><strong>1. 5/95 RULE</strong></p>

<p>Keeping your idea secret will kill you and your idea.</p>

<p>We were so secrete that it was more of a cult (financially + emotionally harmful cult) than a startup. </p>

<p>No one will steal your idea. People will disagree with me on this to death. But people have bills to pay, projects to work on, IDEAS OF THEIR OWN! There are millions of ideas. But it's all about execution. 5% idea. 95% execution. I'd give less than 5% to the idea since the idea changes a ridiculous amount along the way.</p>

<p>The more you tell people about your idea the more feedback you'll get and the more you'll understand people's needs. This is by far my biggest regret with this first startup. </p>

<p><strong>2. IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT ON YOUR OWN YOU WILL FAIL</strong></p>

<p>Do not EVER hire a software development (tech shop, etc) company to do it for you.</p>

<p>We hired a software company to build it. They robbed us. Literally. Legal crime. Lied to us. Delayed the project. Then I learned how to code. And realized 750 hours of $work is really only about 10 hours of ""engineering"".</p>

<p>Then we hired another. </p>

<p><strong>3. FREELANCERS</strong></p>

<p>They won't steal your ideas. You should go to UpWork.com and find a developer there. Make sure he's yours (or she) and that he's going to tell you ""no"" when you're asking to build a stupid idea. Make sure you have enough cash for 30hrs a week (at least) for at least 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>4. READ STARTUP LITERATURE</strong> </p>

<p>A. The Lean Startup - Eric Ries (You'll die without this)
     - Read this before building and spending a dime. 
B. Read the references in the book then read those books. 
c. Zero to One - Peter Thiel (Will teach you what not to build and what to build and how to build it)
D. Trust Me I'm Lying - Ryan Holiday (Marketing bible)</p>

<p><strong>5. NDAs DON'T HELP</strong></p>

<p>If someone steals your idea, it'll be very hard for you to sue them VERY hard. IP (intellectual property) law is very tough... Look at products all around you (Google, Bing, iPhone, Samsung) . People copy each other even though things are patented. NDAs can only do so much. If that person who steals your idea gives a tiny twist to the idea, then it's a different idea. You lost. </p>

<p>Screw NDAs. Anyways, who said your idea will succeed? </p>

<p><strong>6. DON'T EVER HIRE A TECH SHOP</strong></p>

<p>I can't emphasize this point enough. </p>

<p>-- </p>

<p>Go to UpWork, find someone from a cheap labor country like India, Bangladesh, Romania or Ukraine. Have them sign an NDA (if that makes you feel better because you'll have a hard time enforcing that in any of those countries) and then there you go. You can watch them code because it's recorded. They only work when the camera is running so you're sure they're not screwing you. And bam, you can call the developer 24/7 and ask them hows it going, or to change something or to fix a bug. </p>

<p>Either way, if you're not in 110% in control you're destined to fail. </p>

<p>Good-luck.</p>

","<p>""Website Solutions"" is a very broad description and is often a very competitive market and can take a long time to get a strong standing.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Definitely brand via the ""flashy website"".  If you are the
web developer for the site even better it just your time vs your 
money.  </p>

<p>If you are <strong>not</strong> a web developer, I would opt for getting a great
site template from Theme Forest (or something like them), and great
book on HTML5 and Javascript. Dedicate time to YouTube videos
learning about Responsive HTML5 design and Web Development.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid getting office space until you have a enough revenue to
cover the cost.  You can pay some office leasing companies (e.g.,
Regus) for virtual office space. This will give you a mailing
address, even a receptionist depending on your package level.
According to their site you can reserve a personal office/conference
room upon request(at additional costs of course). </p>

<p>If a Regus-like situtation is not unavailable or too expensive, I
would opt for a co-work location for holding face-to-face meetings.</p></li>
<li>Take the additional time and effort of Branding your self via the
social networks.  Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn would top my
first three pics.</li>
<li>Blog on your own site. Blog on others sites. This can be a great way
of increasing you placement in search engines with out having to use

"What are the pros and cons of Founder Dual class stock?","198","","<p>I would like to have a Dual class stock structure for my common stock to have super voting rights.</p>

<p>Can someone explain what are the pros and cons if I go with such structure?</p>
","<p>It is not uncommon for companies that want to limit the decision making process through voting to have multiple classes of shares. </p>

<p>For example, ""class A Ordinary"" will be full voting shares, but ""class B Ordinary"" will have the same value from a purchase and dividend point of view, but not from the point of view of voting rights. It is very common in the UK within an <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/tax-employee-share-schemes/enterprise-management-incentives-emis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EMI Scheme</a> to do this sort of thing, where the founders of a business will have A class shares and the employees will be granted B class (non-voting) shares.</p>

<p>They are sometimes called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_share"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Golden Shares</a> to be exercised under certain conditions.</p>

<p>In a business founder situation, you would need to have some good reasons for a difference of voting rights. There are some very good articles on this site written around this issue</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have the super voting right shares, then you will probably control the company with fewer shares</li>
<li>You will have a smaller cut of the pie from a dividend point of view</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
<li>With another person having the super voting rights shares, you will most likely lose control of the company</li>
<li>You will have a larger cut of the pie from a dividend point of view</li>
</ul>

<p>Other questions to consider</p>

<ul>
<li>Are these super shares able to be purchased at a premium cost?</li>
<li>How are they to be disposed of? i.e. do you have a shareholders agreement that specifies that the other party can only sell them back to the business and not to an outside party?</li>
<li>What is the basis of these super shares being offered/taken? Is it more equity, time, ideas, ip or other resource provided up front to equalise the relationship</li>
<li>Be careful that the other founding parties in the relationship do not feel like minority shareholders, otherwise, you will have business partners that are not engaged in making the business succeed</li>

"How to find a business developer (possibly in another country) to partner up with?","196","","<p>So I have this awesome app that me and a couple of friends have been working on for four years or so. It's approaching a state of being finished and is well received by our users.</p>

<p>Now we're working on making the whole thing profitable. Hopefully it'll all go well. The problem is that we're from a fairly small country (Sweden) and our app is kind of bound to country-level markets, so we're considering expanding.</p>

<p>Technically it's fairly easy to release in another country. Shouldn't be more than a weeks work or so. But feels almost pointless if we don't have knowledge of the players on the market and someone local to develop business relations, sign partnership contracts etc.</p>

<p>So, my question is: <strong>How do you come into contact with a business developer in another country?</strong></p>

<p>We're primarily interested in targeting the US or a large European country such as UK or Germany.</p>
","<p>With international expansion, as with most things, the rule is to <em>outsource what you understand</em>. </p>

<p>So you need to start by asking two questions:</p>

<p><strong>1. Do you have a detailed map of how it's working in Sweden?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Do you know that what you have under (1) can, on principle, be replicated in another country?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Is there a clear business model for the app itself, and a clear and objective way of valuing the contribution of a business developer?</strong> </p>

<p>If your answer to any of these is ""no,"" you're probably not ready to do a deal that you can be confident in, though that <em>doesn't</em> mean it's too early to start building relationships.</p>

<p>If everything is a nice ringing ""yes,"" then I would suggest you do some preliminary work to select your next target market. Is there a way you can quickly characterise the opportunity, the competitive landscape, the work required to get started, and the operational implications? Because you only have a first new market once, invest time up-front so you know, during the near-inevitable period when it's taking <em>all</em> of your time for <em>no</em> reward, that it's worth pressing ahead.</p>

<p>So now you have a framework for a workplan and a deal, and a target country. Now it's time to reach out. By definition, jobbing business developers should be easy to find, but they may be hard to prequalify. So you should do two things.</p>

<p>First, <strong>work your network</strong>. LinkedIn is made precisely to help you to reach out into and out from your network, and to get some rounded perspective on people you don't know. </p>

<p>Second, work out how to make <strong>a non-exclusive deal that's no regrets for both parties</strong>. There's a good chance you won't connect with the right person first off, so work out a deal shape that you can, if you need to, offer to more than one person. A great business developer is going to argue you out of this, but so is a lousy one, so you need to think through how to negotiate. Great business developers want to keep their networks to themselves, so trading some exclusivity (e.g. for a particular type of partner, or in a particular geography, for a set period) for activity reporting and associated targets is a way of finding a win/win compromise.</p>

<p>Now you have the deal ready, push its headlines out through your networks, have something with a little more detail to send people who express interest, then <strong>screen and interview in exactly the way you would if you were hiring</strong>. You don't just need someone who's good, you need someone who's good for your team, and who you will be happy to represent your company and your propositions in a country that's remote from you.</p>

<p>That's me done with the straight answer. <strong>There's another totally different strategy I've seen work out pretty well for some people.</strong></p>

<p>If there's a market that is really a natural for your app, chances are that there's an accelerator that would love to hear from you. It's often easier to outsource looking after your home market (or for part of the team to stay put), while you locate yourself where you want to be next. You don't have to do this via an accelerator, of course, but even the application process will help you focus, lead you into new relationships, and potentially offer a great way to de-risk without giving up too much in the process.</p>

"Minimum viable product for a mobile application","196","","<p>I recently launched a mobile application which, one could say, was in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"">minimum viable product</a> state. That is, it was lacking some key features, but it could still function fine and still solved the problem that it set out to solve. My reasoning behind the early launch was to get the product out to the public as soon as possible in order for it to start making a name for itself. I figured that since it was easy for me to update it, it didn't matter as much that it wasn't in a more complete state. I worry, however, that new users coming across the app might be turned away by its not-quite-complete state and be turned off by it that they'd remove it from their phone before I got a chance to push out my updates to them.</p>

<p>My question is: did I make the right decision? <strong>In the case of easily-updated products, such as mobile apps, is it better to launch quick with a minimum viable product, or wait until the application is in a more ready state?</strong></p>
","<p>I'll say to this what I find myself saying to every other question on this site: it isn't directly related to your answer, but <strong>make sure you have your intellectual property first</strong>. No matter what, don't release a product that doesn't have the patents you want done on it.</p>

<p>Phew, now that that's out of the way, I think you raise an interesting point. There are definitely some advantages in launching a minimal product.</p>

<p><strong>Corner the Market Early</strong></p>

<p>If you're the first to be out there with your app's functionality, you're bound to receive most of the downloads in the future just through brand recognition and word-of-mouth. It's way easier to succeed as the first than it is as the second.</p>

<p><strong>Early Feedback</strong></p>

<p>Maybe users want your app to go in a bit of a different direction than you had planned. Launching early like this gives you distinct advantages in that you can have real people using your app in the real world before all your plans are set in stone, and more importantly, before you've already invested a ton in some feature that people just turn out not to use that much. You could also find that hoards of people download your app in the first few days and that it might be worth hiring another developer on to push the process along, even if only by a week or two.</p>

<p><strong>Early Profits</strong></p>

<p>No secret, it's hard to work for nothing. By launching an app, you're offsetting your income to be earlier, which is good. That might mean it'll come immediately instead of when you get the app 100% done, or it could mean that you'll just make the money <em>earlier</em> in the future than you otherwise would have. Either way, it's good for morale and paying personal and professional bills.</p>

<p><strong>Morale</strong></p>

<p>Plain and simple. Shipping is good for morale. Whether you work alone or with a team, watching a product you've worked hard on for months go out into the real world is an exciting--albeit scary--time. If you can show yourself and your employees that yes, in fact, your product <em>will get done</em> with the leap of faith of launching an almost-ready app, you'll give them something to work off of. Particularly if you haven't been paying much, as many startups are wont to do.</p>

<p><strong>Get Everyone Comfortable</strong></p>

<p>Users need time to adjust just as applications do. A user won't pop on your app and suddenly use every feature, nor do you want them to. It's a process, so getting them started with a fraction of your planned feature-set probably won't really have all that negative an effect. Give them the time it takes for you to write more, to learn how to use what you've already got. They won't feel overwhelmed by having way too much to do, and you'll benefit from fewer support calls as the learning-curve builds itself slowly.</p>

<p><strong>Keep 'em Coming Back</strong></p>

<p>Finally--I think, admittedly this is several ""finally""s in--releasing updates to an app is a huge market advantage. Think of when you get used to using an app you love then one day you turn on your phone and, gah!, it was updated <em>with a new feature!</em> It's an exciting experience for us all. If you can give end-users that excitement every few months, you'll keep them using your app during that time. The last thing any of us want is to be thrown into the endless abyss of a being a download-run-never-use-again app. And updates help avoid that. If nothing else, it's free advertisement for their phones to pop up and say ""Updated [your app's name]!""</p>

<hr>

<p>So, well, yes, that's all well and good. But it doesn't really answer the question. Did you make the right call? Well, that depends. I think the first thing to note here is that the ""right call"" is a subjective matter that cannot be told retroactively. So first off, don't stress over what the right call <em>was</em> so much as what you can benefit from the call you made. If you launch early then ignore your users, you've made a bad decision. But in my experience, users are <em>pretty darn</em> hard to ignore. They tend to navigate ways to getting developer attention. I'll leave it up to readers whether I mean that in a good way or not.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, though, I don't think it <em>really</em> hurts your image to have a mediocre launch. How many of us remember <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thefacebook.png"" rel=""nofollow"">thefacebook.com</a>? If you're going to make it big, having a bit of a bumpy start with a not-so-full-featured app out the gate won't kill you.</p>

<p>But that all said, for future reference, if I were you, I'd launch it as a beta. You have a choice whether to make it a private, invitation-only beta (and, you know, invite a few thousand people) or a public one and advertise through social media, but I think that's a great way to launch a mediocre product and still, miraculously get people super pumped over the idea of it.</p>

Incorporating in the US means your company would be liable to US taxes (and your company could pay you a salary in Canada, making your income liable to Canadian taxes). At very least it means double the paperwork which could bring increased risk if you upset taxman either side of the border.</p>

"Why did you fail?","191","","<p>I know this will be a question which will be unpleasent to anwer, but I will ask it anyway. A  general wisdom of start-ups is to fail fast but never to fail twice. Because you can learn from mistakes much more then from successes. </p>

<p>Now my question for you: Where and why did you fail? </p>
","<p>In my time working at a startup I have gathered a list of reasons the launch of your business may fail:</p>

<p><strong>You failed to do market research</strong>: Many people fail to do proper market research and never identify their target market. Without thorough market research, even the best product launches can fail miserably. This is because you must validate that there is a need for your product before you take it to market.</p>

<p>Who is your target audience? Is there a pathway to sustainable growth? Finding out the answers to these questions could potentially save your launch.</p>

<p><strong>You didn’t educate your customers</strong>: When you are developing a new product you have to allow time to educate people about your product before the launch. This is especially true if you are introducing a revolutionary product that people may not understand.</p>

<p>Don’t just assume that people will understand the value of your product. You may have to explain it to them repeatedly until they can truly grasp it.</p>

<p><strong>You didn’t spend enough time preparing for your launch</strong>: Think of launching a new product as planting seeds; you can’t just plant your seeds and expect fruit the next morning. You have to allow enough time to plant and water your seeds before you can expect to reap the benefits of your labor.</p>

<p>Launching a new product requires the same foresight and planning. This is especially true if you don’t already have an established market. You need to allow enough time to build a relationship with your target audience, inform them about your product and why it will help them, and create a sense of urgency.</p>

<p><strong>Your marketing efforts were ineffective</strong>: Many product launches fail simply because the customer did not understand the message. People must understand why your product is different from the competition, how it will help them, and why they need it now.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, however, I have also learned some <a href=""https://tallyfy.com/launching-a-new-product/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tips</a> to ensure a successful launch. Good luck!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In certain industries, goods are distributed to downstream members in
  the supply chain with the understanding that the goods may be returned
  for credit if they are not sold e.g., newspapers and magazines. This
  acts as an incentive for downstream members to carry more stock,
  because the risk of obsolescence is borne by the upstream supply chain
  members. However, there is also a distinct risk attached to this
  logistics concept. The downstream member in the supply chain might
  exploit the situation by ordering more stock than is required and
  returning large volumes. In this way, the downstream partner is able
  to offer high level of service without carrying the risks associated
  with large inventories. The supplier effectively finances the
  inventory for the downstream member. It is therefore important to
  analyze customers’ accounts for hidden costs.</p>

You can use agile or any other methodology, but you should keep control of your resources. Plan accordingly, monitor the progress and make your adjustments. So just remember freelancers are like employees, who are not fully assigned to you. And the only difference is in how you will pay them. </p>

<p>Exceptional freelancers have the professional maturity to understand <strong>they are suppliers.</strong> They will commit to a result (work-package, product, part of a product) and expect to be paid only if they deliver. I expect if you work with one of those they will not drop in the middle of the project. Also they will need little to no management. You don't need to create a policy. You need a clear agreement of what needs to be done. Agreement should eventually be formalized in a contract with penalties.</p>

"Valuing the company from a convertible note","189","","<p>I'm trying to figure out how convertible notes work. Specifically, I want to figure out my implied valuation from a convertible note. (Yes, I know the point of convertible notes is that you don't have an explicit valuation, but there is an implicit one.) Consider the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note terms:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>5% simple, non-compounded interest</li>
  <li>20% discount rate</li>
  <li>$10m cap</li>
  <li>12 months of runway (estimate)</li>
  <li>$1m investment</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>A year from now, raise at a $10M valuation, with a share price of one
  dollar per share. Your investors have 1.0 5M total, thanks to accrued
  interest, and they get to purchase at $.80 a share due to the
  discount. This gives them an ownership stake of 1.0 5M/.8 =1,312,500
  shares; 13% of the total. </p>
  
  <p>So investors will be purchasing a 13% stake a year from now for $1M,
  which gives a nondiscounted valuation of $7.7 M. (Note that this
  valuation is post-money relative to the first raise, but pre-money
  relative to the second. Confused yet?) Investors will often tell you
  that they believe they will average a 20% IRR; this is complete crap
  but whatever. Using that discount rate (the time discount rate, not
  the discount rate of the note) we get a net present post-money
  valuation of $7.7M/1.2= $6.4M. Subtracting the initial investment
  gives us a pre-money of $5.4 M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that a correct computation of the net present value of the company implied by the investment?</p>
","<p>The solution posted in the question is slightly wrong.</p>

<p>As usual, assume <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">rational pricing</a>. We can view the convertible note as a forward contract. (This is ignoring the possibility of the note converting for less than its cap, but it's pretty close.)</p>

<p>Under the rational pricing assumption, forwards are deterministically priced, so to determine the present valuation you need to do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Figure out the effective share price. This was done correctly in the question.</li>
<li>Based on that forward price, use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_contract#Rational_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">forward pricing equation</a> to determine the current spot price. This was done incorrectly in the question: it's irrelevant what ROI an investor wants to get, only the risk-free interest rate matters.</li>

I personally would wait to incorporate the new company until it's clear it's got momentum. That's what I did, however, the newer startup didn't work out so it did save the costs of an incorporation and there were tax benefits.</p>

"How can I sell support contracts when customers don't need support?","187","","<p>My business is successful in selling software licenses, but we're facing difficulties when trying to sell support contracts. Our software is too good. It's too stable. Bad things almost never happen, and when they do happen it's often not caused by our software.</p>

<p>I've heard that enterprises often want support contracts and SLAs as safety nets, so that when things go wrong they can call someone. But that's not my experience. Many customers who've purchased a support contract cancel when their term is over, because during the entire term they haven't needed support even once.</p>

<p>While it's a good thing that our software just works, customers feel like they've wasted money because they haven't used any support. It's kind of like how some people feel cheated when they've bought a train ticket, but they haven't been checked during the trip.</p>

<p>Given this situation, how can I better sell support contracts? Is there anything I can do to make customers feel that the money they paid for the support contracts wasn't wasted? Do other software companies have similar problems, and how do they solve it? Or is it a lost cause and I should not bother with support contracts at all?</p>
","<h3>How much do your customers <em>expect</em> that it will to cost them to support the software if they <em>don't</em> have a contract?</h3>

<p>This provides an <em>upper bound</em> on how much they will be willing to pay.</p>

<p>Of course, you cannot know the answer exactly&mdash;but you do know that a sensible calculation would involve listing the conceivable types of events, multiplying <strong>the estimated probability</strong> of each by <strong>its estimated cost of rectification</strong>, and then taking the sum of the results.</p>

<p>The point being, the answer is influenced <em>not only</em> by how likely failure is perceived to be <em>but also</em> by the perceived costs of rectification (including any loss of goodwill that is suffered whilst their system is down and any loss of management focus on their other tasks in the interim).  Your question only addresses the first of these concerns.</p>

<p>Clearly you don't want to increase customers' expectation of a software failure, as that might drive them (or future prospects) away from your product altogether.  However, there should be little to lose from painting a picture of <em>how costly rectification could be in the event of such an unlikely failure</em>&mdash;thus increasing the perceived value of your support contracts.</p>

<p>If rectification would never be costly and failure is extremely unlikely, then the cost to you of providing a support contract must be extremely low&mdash;in which case perhaps you should consider lowering the pricing until it falls below the customer's expected costs of not having a contract.</p>

","<p>I think Mr Cuban is referring to <em>how your idea can be protected against competitive threats</em>, in a broad sense.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am 16 years old and I know there are many other minors who have achieved business success within the app industry and I want to know if and where I am taking an ineffective approach gaining success as a young entrepreneur.</p>

<p>This is woefully incorrect. For every kid who succeeds, there are a dozens upon dozens who fail. This is true at age 16 but also at later ages. The thing is you're constantly hearing about those who succeed but hardly ever about those who don't. Set your expectations right: entrepreneurship is a road filled with cadavers (and wrecked relationships owing to poor work-life balance; don't do that).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly these other teenagers must have put in a lot more work or received more help than meets the eye, but I still think my approach has been pretty identical to these teen wunderkinds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blunt truth is that the only real difference between you and most of them is that they got lucky. Take my word for it on this one: those kids had no more idea of what they ought to do than you did, and they put the same type of effort in their project as you're putting in. More often than not, the difference was an external factor - one that was completely beyond their control - that kicked in at an opportune moment. And, again, this holds true at much later ages as well.</p>

<p>The sorriest aspect of it and the way it gets reported is when these kids and young adults are in denial over what actually happened. They end up thinking they did something brilliant and putting it forward. And, of course, since they were successful once they tend to attract yet more external factors which in term make their success more likely in their next ventures. However talented they actually are, the sorry truth is that their success is in no way replicable by the next guy.</p>

<p>The cynic in me would additionally suggest that, in these cases, the greater their ego and self-denial, the more likely they'll end up writing a business book (on management, entrepreneurship, startups, what have you). Consider the difference between, say, the self-congratulating writings of a Ben Horowitz at one end, the more methodical writings of a Marc Roberge in the middle, and the much humbler lessons learned of a Steve Blank at the other end. When reading startup advice, keep a sharp eye out for self-congratulation and impractical advice - it's often a tell-tale sign that the author is confusing luck with talent.</p>

<p>With this hopefully out of the way, your last question begs for a methodology. For this, a good starting point could be <a href=""https://steveblank.com"">Steve Blank's blog</a>. Particularly its archives - they're a great source of priceless entrepreneurial advice that you can pick up good learnings from. A TL;DR summary could be: get in front of customers to figure out what they want to pay for; then figure out the smallest subset thereof that they'll <em>actually</em> pay for; then build.</p>

"Versioning convention","184","","<p>By convention, would a software version 0.9.101 come before or after version 0.9.90? And why?</p>
","<p>Short answer:</p>

<p>Version 0.9.101 is usually released after 0.9.90. But it depends on you what kind of version numbering scheme you use.</p>

<hr />

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>From my experience, a common version numbering scheme is something along the lines of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>major.minor[.bugfix]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where each of these numbers can be increased as far as needed. Also, when sorting the version numbers each part is interpreted as a number, so, as 101 is bigger than 90, version 0.9.101 is considered newer than version 0.9.90. </p>

<p>If you, for example, add a minor new feature to version 0.9.101, you can release it as version 0.10[.0], and because 10 is bigger than 9, version 0.10 will be perceived as newer than version 0.9.101.</p>

<p>As a real world example, have a look at the past releases of Mac OS X. In 2013, Apple released OS X Mavericks (version number 10.9) and in 2014 OS X Yosemite (version number 10.10). Other releases now were numbered e.g. as 10.10.4. Although for these numbers, the major part is actually the second part. The first <em>10</em> comes from the <em>X</em> in <em>Mac OS X</em> (a roman 10). So currently Apple uses something like <em>10.major[.minor]</em> for the OS X releases.</p>

<p>I don't personally know anyone who has done a deal over 20% but I am sure they happen.</p>

<p>A lot will depend on what your plans are for future investment and how much you are raising this round. If you have a target valuation in mind for the next round and a plan to add that much value to your business between now and then, you could get a vague idea of how much equity the investment will convert to at the next round with differing discounts.</p>

<p>Take a look at other start ups in your area and look at their valuation progression. Also look at other startups in your sector and track their valuations. Do valuations get based on specific metrics (number of active users, turn over, downloads)?. If they do track to metrics then look at your plan for those metrics to work out a best case valuation. Then set a discount you'd be comfortable with.</p>

<p>This also gives you some credit with investors as investors like to see that the future of the business has been considered.</p>

<p>Saying all the above - it's probably easier to think of these things after having been through this a few times. From a purely instinctual level I would have a difficult time agreeing to anything over a 10% discount unless the investor involved was bringing something unique to the table or the amount of money invested was low - meaning the risk of a low valuation next round wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on the amount of equity given over.</p>

"Can I target users outside my country in my new startup?","181","","<p>I am planning to start up an online business targeting users in a different country. The business is providing an online service for managing schools online including payments, scheduling and reporting. Is there any law around this? Do I need to get approval if I am targeting a specific country which I am not in?</p>
","<p>I hope you understand how incredibly <em>complex</em> of an answer this question requires, given the generic fact that all we know about your industry is that it is an ""<em>online business targeting users in a different country</em>.""</p>

<p>Your question is pointing towards a specific topic called <em>product compliance</em> - and it is a very huge topic. Several 'large ($1b+) companies have entire divisions and partners who build software <em>just to tackle product compliance.</em></p>

<p>I interned at a company whose main source of revenue was a software suite that they sold to Cisco, among dozens of other clients, for 6 figures a sale. Guess what the software did?</p>

<p>Without getting to the specifics, it was all-things <em>regulatory compliance</em>: whether it was for restrictions on frequencies, emissions, bandwidth, or things more obvious like radiation.</p>

<p>Of course, in your case, online software, I think the most important things you have to look at are taxes. You're clearly generating revenue, or plan to, and if you're operating out of the USA you need to be established as a formal business who can run work in each country.</p>

<p>To put your question into perspective, the S-Corp I am part is required to submit paperwork for each <em>state</em> we are operating in. I can only imagine what the process is like for each country. Actually, I had a conversation with our agent about this very thing. First of all, some countries are grouped together, but generally, there are different regulations for different groups of countries. For example, it's much easier to operate in Canada if you're already in the USA, but it may be much harder to operate in a country like Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>EDIT: Since you've updated your question, I'll provide a few more details. First of all, you need to become familiar with the different trade groups, finding out which countries you want to do business in. Clearly, it is a country-by-country basis in terms of doing sales, and you'll want to make sure you're up to date with the laws and regulations on a per-country basis.</p>

<p>If you're not actually <em>selling</em> a service online, this is a totally different story, and you can just run your site and get traffic. But the moment you <em>accept payments</em> internationally, you better know what you're doing, because chances are there are regulations you need to check in with.</p>

<p>As much as I hate doing this, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_commercial_law"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia wins out</a> here. The quality of resources in that link is incredible, and it covers the breadth of your question very well.

"I want to leave a ""startup"" but they don't have the money to pay my equity at its legal base value. Sell it cheaper, or hold?","181","","<p>I have some equity in a startup that was founded a year ago, because I was working in it as CTO. I now want to leave, and they are interested in me leaving all equity for the small amount I initially paid. The reasons they cite is that having someone that's not working, didn't put a lot of money but have equity is bad in front of an investor. I want to sell the equity at the value the society pact says it has. They say they don't have money to buy it, and that it's fair that I just leave for the small amount.</p>

<p>Do I hold equity unless they buy it at that price? Will they really look bad in front of investors if they state they used that equity to pay an employee?</p>

<p>Thank you very much, for this answer, and for the useful past answer.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Do I hold equity unless they buy it at that price? (...)
  I'm fairly sure it's going to fail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the two main risks you take by refusing to sell the stock:</p>

<ul>
<li>The company goes bankrupt and you get zero.</li>
<li>New or existing investors do a hostile dilution to make your position worthless.</li>
</ul>

<p>So don't be too greedy if you're truly convinced they'll fail.</p>

<p>Have you considered making them an offer whereby they pay you in two steps?</p>

<ol>
<li>They pay you whatever you can get away with now, e.g. the amount you initially paid.</li>
<li>They sign you an IOU for the balance, to be paid later, e.g. after receiving their investment, or a year or two down the road.</li>
</ol>

<p>That way if the startup fails you get the money you put in back. And if they succeed you get somewhere between what you'd have earned by working for a salary and the current ""fair value"". If they're adamant and refuse to pay you the latter, the salary argument might be a good one to put a floor underneath which you won't budge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will they really look bad in front of investors if they state they used that equity to pay an employee?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tricky question. If it's a lot of stock and the employee is no longer there or involved, it can reek of ""we couldn't work as a team with one of our cofounders"". Cofounders splitting up isn't unheard of though. It also introduces the notion that you get away with a chunk of the company without contributing anything -- their incentive to dilute your position will be very high.</p>

<p>Of an IOU, in comparison, you can say ""we promised to pay a friend who helped us.""</p>

","<p>It's difficult to answer this without knowing the legal details of the company (which don't exist anyway.) If you are the only owner of your company, it's likely a sole propietorship or LLC. </p>

<p>Under a sole proprietorship, the individual and business share income, assets and debts. If this is the situation, the income of the company is already in your hands and you are already paying taxes on it.</p>

<p>Under an LLC, the rules for distributing profits to owners would be documented in your formation documents if you had any. Since you are the sole owner, you can make all of the decisions. I think the easiest way would be pay yourself a yearly salary, which you would of course have to pay income taxes on.

<strong>Services:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Search Engine Advertising</li>
<li>Graphic Design</li>
</ul>
","<p>TL;DR: pick an hourly or daily or weekly rate that makes your numbers work, and chase clients that are willing to pay that much.</p>

<p>First off, there are multiple ways to price a product or a service, which you can read about here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/7499/how-do-i-set-a-price-on-my-product/7500#7500"">How do I set a price on my product?</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>Assuming you're not in market-based price limbo and that you stick to cost-based pricing (i.e. the easiest to implement), keep in mind that there are two types of expenses in a business: fixed and variable. Your fixed expenses are there even if you're not selling. Your variable expenses are those that strictly relate to actually producing whatever it is that you're outputting.</p>

<p>Most businesses have a lot of fixed expenses and few variable expenses at first glance. Because, well, those salaries need to get paid no matter what. But if you dig a bit deeper, you can often treat a lot of fixed expenses as variable expenses after breaking them down by project, activity, whatever is relevant to you.  In a factory for instance, you ideally want things like worker salaries broken down per unit of production when considering costs and prices, even if your accountant tells you ""hey, those are fixed expenses"".</p>

<p>If you do that with your business you'll end up with two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Streams of variable expenses that you need to cover under any circumstances by selling <em>for more</em> than said expenses.</li>
<li>A pool of fixed expenses that you need to cover by selling <em>often enough</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>How often ""often enough"" is depends, of course, on how high ""for more"" is. The higher your profit margin, the less often you need to sell to break even. Pick a number that works and call it a day.</p>

<p>But all of the above is very theoretical.</p>

<p>It's useful to have in mind, but in practice there's a little bit more to it because the ugly realities of market demand and production capacity kick in.</p>

<p>Closer to the ground, you actually want to ask yourself two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>How many clients you can realistically close each month at a give price point.</li>
<li>How much you need to earn in total to break even each month - all costs included, fixed or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each answer gives you a number that'll help you guide your pricing decision. What the figure is exactly is mostly arbitrary, so long as a) it covers your costs, b) you're able to find buyers who write you checks, and c) you're not too overworked, keeping in mind that you'll be spending time on marketing, sales, and a slew of management and administrative-related tasks.</p>

<p>As a tip, charge by the day (or half day) rather than by the hour. Doing so spares you from clients who breath down your neck asking why you invoiced 15-min of your time to write them an email. (Mind the definition though. A day doesn't mean ""I'm putting 8 productive hours on you."" It actually means ""I'm putting a normal day on you, including clearing out my emails, doing admin chores, and taking an occasional break"" - so 6-7h of productive work in practice.)</p>

"Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for C2C startup","178","","<p>When a startup has one main audience it seems fairly simple to understand the aspects to take into account for calculating CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). However, when the business model is Consumer to Consumer (C2C), the scenario is a bit more complex.</p>

<ul>
<li>In a C2C business model, how is the CAC defined and calculated?</li>
<li>Should it be determined against both audiences? If yes, how?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Your CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) is first and foremost a tool to prioritize your marketing efforts. Don't merely stick to calculating an overall CAC. You want to break it down per channel, and per product when applicable, and then put it in the context of that channel's CLV (Customer Lifetime Value).</p>

<p>Failing to do so, you may end up with e.g. a <code>[[$10, 25%], [$20, 25%], [$30, 25%], [$40, 25%]]</code> CAC tuple and erroneously conclude that your CAC is e.g. $25. The CLV for context is also crucial, because it may turn out that the latter CAC tuple yields an <code>[$25, $25, $25, $50]</code> CLV tuple - and now you know that the $10 and $40 channels get the most bang for the buck.</p>

<p>Without more details it's anyone's guess how to best break it down in your specific case. Intuitively though, breaking down consumers by source/origin/campaign/whatever and matching each one might get you in the right direction. Mind correlations as you work out the gory details: working on source A-B also contributes to e.g. A-C, A-D, B-C and B-D if you've four key sources.</p>

<p>Pro tip: decide on an attribution model, <a href=""https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#trafficsources"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extract the data from GA</a> when they first sign up, and throw it into ChartMogul for pretty visualizations and segmentation.</p>

<hr>

<p>In light of the comment you added with more details... your actual customers are those users who are sellers. What you're looking for in the end is to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>The (one-time) channel- and business type-based costs associated with acquiring your sellers; and</li>
<li>The (recurring) channel-based costs associated with acquiring these specific sellers' buyers</li>
</ul>

<p>... such that the total costs involved over a given seller's lifetime are less than your sellers' total lifetime value.</p>

<p>It's a thorny network-related problem in that it's full of correlations and convoluted feedback loops because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acquiring sellers might bring bonus buyers as a side effect and vice versa</li>
<li>Acquiring one type of seller in a specific channel might also contribute to acquiring another type of seller in the same channel, and similarly for buyers</li>
<li>Different seller types will likely have buyer types in common</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding insult to injury, there's an extra layer of non-linearity in that your customer lifetime value depends on your sellers' ability to sell enough to make it worth their time to use your platform, and the latter is directly related to whether you've a large enough number of buyers for them to stay around. Put another way, you've a threshold to work out for each seller segment, and even then the threshold is actually per seller because a small fry might be happy with some clients but a larger/more lucrative seller might need a lot more buyers to justify using your platform.</p>

<p>Anyway, you certainly don't want to waste any time trying to model this perfectly and find the optimal solution. Look for local optimums through trial and error instead - aka things that work.</p>

<p>Start with the seller acquisition costs. How much does it cost you to acquire a new seller, per channel, and probably segmented by business type for good measure. Then do the same type of work for their respective buyers, also per channel.</p>

<p>If a buyer channel caters to more than one seller buckets, distribute its costs. (How is rather arbitrary: you could e.g. pro-rate based on revenue %.)</p>

<p>Then compute seller CAC + buyer acquisition costs as suggested in the first part of my answer to get a feel of what's worth doing or not.</p>

<p>In practical terms, I'd gather you already have a feel of a handful of seller types that will likely be profitable. Start with the most promising one, and try to optimize it. Then throw in another, etc.</p>

<p>So I <strong>started a small IT firm</strong> and <strong>recruited some 5 freshers</strong> trained them for 3 months with fundamentals of web development and started with small tasks. But again managing them was difficult for me. Because I've been doing multiple things by myself right from getting projects to delivering the project. More over 2 of my employees who were irregular but productive comparing to their colleagues just absconded our office after a few months learning things and with the remaining employees, one of them is less productive but regular, one of them is irregular but productive and one of them is regular and some what helpful.

<p><strong>Before I make another crucial decision could you please point me to the right direction that what I've missed. For an example, should I have hired a Team Lead and HR before hiring freshers?</strong></p>
","<p>I had a similar experience (from freelancer to studio). There's something I realized.</p>

<p>It is really hard to get anything done by someone else. It is really hard to find good people and have them stay.</p>

<p>If you don't have a team consisting of 100% of top talents, you'll have to manage them.
You'll have to re-read their code and fix/debug lots of things. And in the end of the day, you should be very grateful that anything works at all.</p>

<p>It will take time and effort in order to have good enough processes and key people so that you have to solve fewer and fewer problems yourself.</p>

<p>Managing people (e.g. having them be more and more autonomous to get things done) is difficult and long.</p>

<p>Of course the golden solution is to have only top tech talents (that will need much less management), but that' not always an option. Because top talents are people like you, who might want to have their own studio and their own employees.</p>

<p>Then, when you hire someone, you have no way to know if they'll stay or not.</p>

<p>People won't stay for their salary (unless it's really high) they'll stay because they like you. They like your team, they like what they're doing and they are happy staying with you. Their work have to make them achieve themselves in a way.</p>

<p>Reaching this is really hard as well, and needs much more than just money.</p>

<p>Hire your engineers one at a time (not 5 in the same time) and make sure that there's a good ambiance before moving on to the next hire.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to train your team, but not for 3 months, this mean you take too much risk on yourself. Two weeks, one month maximum should be enough. (or you should hire some more skilled engineers)</p>

<p>One way of having people stick around is to give them shares, with a vesting (e.g. their earn their shares over time) but that doesn't quite work for a studio.</p>

<p>""Quality Vitamin D, Take One a Day for Normal Results, Two a Day recommended.""</p>

<p>Does this collide with Bayer's trademark/s?</p>

<p>How can one use these generic terms without running into issues.  After all, most doctors tell their patients ""take one a day for two weeks"" when issuing prescriptions.</p>

<p>This is an example. I am not selling vitamins but I find this example aligns closely with the situation I am looking at.</p>
","<p>Trademark law is tricky, and takes a law degree, and a lot of experience to get it down. Its also a portion of the law where both sides have won.</p>

<p>Since I'm no law expert, I defer to <a href=""https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">harvard law school</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A trademark is a word, symbol, or phrase, used to identify a particular manufacturer or seller's products and distinguish them from the products of another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then further down about trademark infringement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be more specific, the use of a trademark in connection with the sale of a good constitutes infringement if it is likely to cause consumer confusion as to the source of those goods or as to the sponsorship or approval of such goods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So moral of the story, if people are likely to confuse the two products, then yes it is infringement. In your story, the doctor saying ""Take one a day"" is not likely to make you confuse the vitamins, and thus does not constitute infringement. </p>

<p>The example of the ad is a little more tricky, but I would still hold that it doesn't constitute infringement. It is an example of what is called fair use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fair use occurs when a descriptive mark is used in good faith for its primary, rather than secondary, meaning, and no consumer confusion is likely to result. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that you are in fact talking about the product itself, not making a marketing statement. they use an example of kellogg's:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a cereal manufacturer may be able to describe its cereal as consisting of ""all bran,"" without infringing upon Kelloggs' rights in the mark ""All Bran."" Such a use is purely descriptive, and does not invoke the secondary meaning of the mark.</p>

<p>A market is not nescessary an unmet consumer need, it can offer the same features as the competition but is more user friendly with a better UX (user experience) design.</p>

<p>Beware of scope creep - adding too many whistles and bells into the first release of your product means the first release will be years away, you'll get bored, distracted, disheartened or all of the above.</p>

<p>Create the simplest version of your product - get test users - talk to the end users and ask them what they like, and importantly, what they do not like. Sometimes unrelated features help bring users - for example, years ago, early versions of windows and few users were used to the mouse - it's said that solitaire, a free game that got packaged with windows had alot to do with teaching folk how to become comfortable with the mouse. It was an unexpected result from a feature that I would call a side salad.</p>

<p>Nobody knows more than your end users. Many big corporations suffered in the past because they did not listen to the customers - I recall IBM going thru a big re-org in the early 1990s and it was blamed on this. </p>

<p>I hope that helps you forward - Best of luck!</p>

"Valuate a brick and mortar startup","177","","<p>I founded a brick and mortar company funded with my own cash and bank loans guaranteed with personal possessions.</p>

<p>The total invested in equipment, raw materials, location and work capital for a year will be around 200,000.</p>

<p>I would like to bring in investors and offer equity as incentive for key employees to join.</p>

<p>What is the fair way to valuate the company? Taking just the 200K as the 'company value' ignores the risk I'm taking and the time and effort I put on getting the company started.</p>

<p>Valuating it on future revenue expectations is the standard for software startups, however it appears to be a big guess since there is no way to accurately predict how much of the market my company will capture. </p>

<p>To illustrate, the company currently has 10,000 shares available, valuating it based solely on the cash invested so far would make those worth 20 each.</p>

<p>If however we forecast the company to have 2 million in revenue after 5 years those shares could theoretically be valuated at 200 each.</p>

<p>Is this how those valuations are done? </p>
","<p><strong>Your shares for $2M revenue in 5 years are not worth $200 each now.</strong> Here's an explanation why - I'm simplifying some concepts - it's not <em>exactly</em> like they teach in business school. </p>

<p><strong><em>The general principle of valuation is that an asset is worth the discounted free cash flow it generates.</em></strong> Let's consider this phrase:</p>

<p><em>""Free cash flow""</em> - this is simple enough. If a widget is going to generate a single $100 bill for you today, once only, and has no salvage value, then it's worth $100.
<em>""Discounted""</em> - this means you take into account the time value and the risk of the cash flow. How do we do that?</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Time:</em> Let's say the widget isn't going to generate that $100 bill today, but rather in one year's time, and let's also assume that your
bank pays 10% annual interest. Well, to have $100 in your account in
a year, you should deposit $100/110% = $90.91 today. So that's what the widget is worth today if it will only generate the cash in a year.</li>
<li><em>Risk:</em> What if your widget isn't 100% reliable? If it only has a 9-in-10 chance of producing the $100 bill in a year, then in expectation it is only worth 90% as much, right? So that's 90.91*90% = $81.82. But wait, ask yourself now as a buyer, is a 90% chance of $90.91 equivalent to a sure $81.82 for you? Rationally, yes, but most people are risk averse when it comes to large sums (because of the sorrow of loss). You might argue that you're only willing to pay $75 for a 90% chance of $100 in a year to compensate you for the uncertainty in the cash flow your counterparty is proposing.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for this example, your discount rate is  100/75 - 100% = 33%, representing the time delay between when the buyer pays for the widget and when it produces the cash, and also the risk premium associated with the uncertainty of the cash flow.</p>

<p>What if the widget will keep producing $100 bills once a year indefinitely, with 90% probability each time? Then your widget would be worth: <em>(note to nitpickers, I'm keeping the dicount rate constant, even though the probability calculation is not strictly correct since each $100 bill is IID)</em></p>

<pre><code>$100/1.33 + $100/1.33^2 + $100/1.33^3 + ...
</code></pre>

<p>Guessing the revenues is can be hard, as is agreeing on an appropriate discount rate if the business isn't very comparable. In these cases, as a proxy for this calculation, sometimes both parties just agree on a multiple of earnings as the valuation (a P/E ratio) based on other businesses of similar size or similar activity.</p>

<p>In your particular case, you have the value of loans (your liabilities) to deduct from your assets' value before arriving at your equity value. You also talk about $2M revenue in 5 years - remember that revenue != profit, and that being brick-and-mortar you have real costs to account for!</p>

<h2>Your business:</h2>

<p>You haven't provided revenue projections, yet it is a brick-and-mortar business. Brick-and-mortar is relatively predictable - your costs should be predictable based on how much revenue you're going to be making. Given that it's brick and mortar, your market size is going to be fixed for the next year or two, unless you are going to borrow more money and open more shops or build more factories. And you've been in business a year, right? So you should have a decent idea of how much profit you'll make for the next 24 months - which will already give you a large indication of the value of your business if you use the DCF method above.</p>

<p>Finally, to consider what I think is the real purpose of your question, remember that your objective in offering equity to employees is not necessarily to realise the value of the equity like in a sale, but rather to provide an incentive. An incentive has a purpose - be clear about what it is (More products per hour? More customers acquired? Less churn?) and decide if offering equity is the best way of achieving that purpose (especially if the equity will be completely illiquid for employees and they won't be able to make a good estimate of future value if they don't know the business well). You have a lot of control over your business' destiny - an employee with 0.4% share and a mid-level job has virtually none. For this reason, your valuations of that equity will differ, and you may find that cash bonuses, or a higher base salary, or autonomy, snacks, and perks would all be more effective motivators. </p>

"Bootstrap Marketing Activities Before Crowdfunding","175","","<p>My company is looking at running a crowdfunding campaign. Initial research suggests that we should have some preliminary marketing activities. Using a bootstrapped budget, What are the most efficient ways to promote our company before beginning the campaign?</p>
","<p>Quoting a <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/4104/1824"">previous answer I gave on this topic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start by understanding that <strong>launching your crowdfunding campaign should be your <em>last</em> step in promoting it</strong>; not the first.</p>
  
  <p>As such, <strong>identify the target audience and where it hangs out online <em>before</em> launching</strong> your crowdfunding campaign. This is key. Your entire execution will be a gazillion times more efficient if you do this properly.</p>
  
  <p>Then <strong>build your list <em>before</em> launching</strong>. You want backers lined up and excited before you publish. In practical terms, this means building a landing page to feed a mailing list, and then drum-rolling the crowdfunding campaign by emailing your list when you're about to launch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll find a lot more in it, so I'd advise you to read it in full.</p>

<p>If I were to prioritize pre-campaign activities, they'd be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Research the market, to understand client needs/wants, and validate the case.</li>
<li>Create a landing page with a newsletter sign up form.</li>
<li>Continue researching the market, with more focus on the type of rewards you'll give. Promote the landing page while doing this and continue doing so until launching.</li>
<li>Prepare the crowdfunding page's copy, video, FAQ items, rewards, etc.</li>
<li>Everything else: write the pre- and post-launch emails, blog posts, and forum posts, plan what to do at key dates and events, scout the rewards-related logistics, etc. Your backers, bloggers, and journalists will be interacting with you throughout the campaign. That's a full time occupation, so come prepared in advance for all realistic scenarios you can think of.</li>
<li>Drum-roll your list and launch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, understand campaign dynamics. The ideal scenario is you being 50% funded or more within the first day or two -- users like to back and promote things that will succeed. And be prepared for the mid-campaign period, where not much happens unless you initiate it.</p>

"Can Google or Facebook ever have a true competitor?","174","","<p>I'm not talking about competition like DuckDuckGo or Bing. They might be good search engines, they might even write better search algorithms. Lets also assume that they achieved massive amounts of computational capability and data storage as that of Google, but they will never get the prime mover advantage that Google has. Because you and me have already decided that whenever we want to search something, we will just visit Google.com! It has been this way since last two decades, but is it going to be the same always? If not, then what will cause us to move to a different search engine?</p>

<p>The same could be said about Facebook in the field of social-networking. It is the major giant network commanding around 70% of all online visitors. Most people will never leave FB because their friends are already on FB. Lets assume that a company XYZ creates a site which has a lot more features than FB, but people will still say, ""Hey, my friends are already on FB, so I have to be on FB"". Isn't this sort of unfair for that new startup XYZ? What can XYZ make to cause people to leave FB and come to its network?</p>
","<p>In business, the trend tends to be that the larger companies innovate less while the younger companies innovate more. The larger companies tend to have a very established customer base and want to do their best to serve the most typical user. The smaller customers tend to aim for getting a niche market before going upstream. When a company stops innovating, competition will appear and try to disrupt the larger companies. Technology is moving at insane paces. The argument about Facebook could have been made a few years ago, but Zuckerberg is very visionary and realized that he would have to do much more to stay relevant. As a result, they bought Instagram and WhatsApp and tried to buy Snapchat. These acquisitions have paid back multiple fold.</p>

<p>Additionally, Zuckerberg noticed that the way people interact with the Internet will change. That led to the decision to buy Oculus which is about to ship soon. While the first few versions of Oculus will be expensive (similar to 2007 iPhones), but the prices will fall or the need for VR will grow to a point where everyone will be buying them.</p>

<p>In Google's case, they started off with search, but has since branched out to many different industries where they could apply their knowledge of search. This led to things like Google Maps, Gmail, etc. They continue to innovate and aim to do the impossible.</p>

<p>They will need to keep innovating and they have to be right on their bets. Microsoft was in a very dominant position in the PC market but missed mobile phones completely. That miss is hurting them right now and allowed Apple to thrive. When companies stop innovating in the right areas, competitors are able to take a foothold and start taking over marketshare. Snapchat, while still young, is looking extremely dangerous to Facebook. They've reinvented the way people interact on the Internet in a way that appeals much more to the younger generation. Google is facing similarly intense competition across all the industries they are in.</p>

<p>Tech companies in general are scared of disruption because of the speed in which it could happen. They may not be able to react in time as the new technology/app/invention catches on like wild fire. In the words of Andy Grove (founder and CEO of Intel), ""only the paranoid survive"".</p>

"Can I Just Sell My Idea for the ""Next Great Thing""?","174","","<p>I recently had an idea for a company / service that has all of the advantages of Uber and Lyft:</p>

<li>revenue from paying users via cost sharing / fees</li>
<li>revenue from free users through advertising</li>

<ul>
<li>being banned / regulated in some jurisdictions</li>
<li>only rolled out in limited markets</li>

<p>I've been a software developer for 15 years and the technology and server infrastructure for this are very doable. I presented it to my mastermind group and they said it's the best idea I've had and very viable, and gave some great ideas for implementing and expanding it.</p>

<p>The traditional route is to put on the Jobs / Zuckerberg hat and bootstrap the business until it's operational and growing, then get seed capital to grow more, then go public, etc. However, due to circumstances in life I'm not able to pursue it right now.</p>

<p>Is it realistic to sell the idea while it's still in the concept stage?
If so, what are the steps?  What resources are available?
If not, what other options are there?</p>
","<p>An idea is not commodity you can readily buy and sell.  </p>

<p>Is it unique and protect-able?</p>

<p>Is this something you could get a patent on?<br>
A patent is not cheap but it is something you can sell.   </p>

<p>Let's say you pitch your idea and they say no and then 1 year later they release a very similar service.  How can you prove they stole your idea?  What is the penalty for stealing an idea?  At a minimum you would need to protect yourself with some type of agreement prior to pitching the idea.  For that consult a lawyer.</p>

<p>You are a developer. If you could develop a proof of concept it would be an easier pitch but buyers are going go look for income even if the company is running at a loss. Subscribers with no income can be a sell if there is a clear path on how to turn a free subscriber into income. Even an angel does not buy an idea. They invest early in an idea with a business plan and they expect you to execute the business plan.</p>

<p>Do you have a friend with the time and energy that you could trust with taking the idea forward?  Be active in the company even if it is just a few minutes to a few hours a week.  Get an agreement that you get X% of the company or revenue.  Be aware an agreement can go both ways - if you own 5% of the company then do you also own 5% of the debt - again consult a lawyer.</p>

<p>Is there a company out there today with the proper infrastructure (both for delivery and sale/marketing)?  Maybe a simple agreement and pitch it to them.  Still a long shot you even get a meeting with a big player.  </p>

<p>This may be a case in which you build a proof of concept and take it to angel or VC that has the clout to get a meeting with a player.  But they are going to want a good share (like half) of the company/idea just to make the pitch.  If the idea is not unique, protect-able, and demonstrable a VC is not going to touch it.</p>

"Process for implementing Support Contracts?","174","","<p>So we have developed a software product for payrol. The system captures timesheets and calculate salaries based on that.</p>

<p>We currently only sell the software with a yearly licence attached. The product works fine, but we have fallen into a hole where our clients keep on calling us at the end of the month with problems with their time entries, not related to software fault, but related to new employees, or funny time entries thus operational reasons.</p>

<p>This is keeping us so busy during the day, that our employees cannot do much more than just answer queries. We have decided that the best way forward would be to start charging for this support, or sell support contracts. </p>

<p>We need advice on how to ""convert"" old clients to accepting that they need to pay. We cannot just off the bat start denying support. So we need a process to gradually introduce the support cost that the client will need to pay. The clients currently ""expect"" us to give them help for our software. </p>

<p>It is not always hours of support per client, it may take us 5 ot 10 minutes to solve some problems. We have thought of starting to charge ad-hoc for support queries, but because the time per case can be so short, we cannot charge the client only a few bucks for each call, that is a lot of billing admin for not much extra.</p>

<p>Please advise on how we could approach this conundrum? Also we rather ""want"" clients to pay monthly for a support contract, but we realise that we cannot force that upon them, so how can we convince them to rather take a contract than ad-hoc services?</p>

<p>Example Ideas:
Should we load the ad-hoc pricing? </p>

<p>Should we make the process of getting ad-hoc support very cumbersome? How? (For instance in large companies, they normally have policy against accepting invoices without first requesting a purchase order from finance, so just having to do that, makes a company decide to rather take a contract than having to go through the process every time they need help working).</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT/UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<p>From the answers below and some more discussions we reviewed our first attempt at an SLA agreement, and realised it was more just a ""Service Agreement"". We did not have any information for response and turnaround time. We only mentioned additional services (like weekly verification of data accuracy) and that the client will pay ad-hoc when rendered by us.</p>

<p><em>License Agreement:</em>
We have realised that we should rewrite our <strong>licence agreement</strong>. Thus the ""benefits"" included when clients pay the <strong>yearly licence fee</strong>. It should clearly stipulate what is included (like free updates and basic support which we will express in a basic SLA agreement with for instance 24 hours response time). Also the reasoning behind why we charge yearly license fees, is that the client pay a fee to have right to use our software.</p>

<p><em>Support Agreement:</em>
Then we will convince the client to commit to a ""<strong>Support Contract</strong>"" which will consist of an SLA with faster response and turnaround times. Reasoning behind why they would pay for a <strong>Support Contract</strong> is because this binds us to provide support to them. Our software comes with a large hardware investment, and they wouldn't want us to just decide to close shop leaving them in the dark. They pay monthly so that we can acquire the necessary resources. Also the SLA provides a guaranteed service level which they can expect to receive, and should give them re-assurance. As our product are heavily used during month end payroll.</p>

<p>We will also look at ""tiered"" fees for the ""<strong>Support Contracts</strong>"". The cost will be fixed per month, calculated using @Baronz's answer below as guide. </p>

<p>For our smaller clients the <strong>Support Contract</strong> will include a fixed amount of support time the client can use under the contract terms and cost. Any out of contract support will be charged ad-hoc at a higher fee per hour than the included time in the contract. We also decided we will allow 1 month roll-over, so that a client can use more support time in the next month if he did not use all in the current month.</p>

<p>For our larger clients, we will provide a ""unlimited"" time support contract, calculated based on the total amount of employees in the company. This ""Support Contract"" would be a bit more expensive (we will consider how much support time a client can use of such size), but we may also provide a SLA with ""priority support"". </p>

<p>With our product we will include a small compulsory support contract for the first 6 months, then the contract will be month-to-month, and he can cancel with 30 days notice. The client can also upgrade his support contract if he continually need and pay for out of contract support.</p>

<p>We will also continue to have ""Service Contracts/Agreements"" for any recurring monthly activities that the client may ask for, like backup service.</p>
","<ol>
<li><strong>What you need to write is a SLA (Service Level Agreement)</strong> If you creatively surf you might find a few on the web that you can alter - I have seen them written from two to twenty pages. You need set expectations. Best write a default document, and refer the default document to a schedule. The schedule will contain variables (hours/days when the service is offered, the cost of out of hours cover, what is covered, what is not covered, how a call is costed/charged, the number/email address for them to call, escalation points when the process you describe fail, and how failure in your service is compensated to the customer).</li>
<li><strong>Costing</strong> I suggest arranging your time in units of 30minutes - so if a call takes 15mins, they are charged for 30mins (one unit). If the call takes 40minutes, you charge for 1 hour (two units). Award your old customers two or four units a month for three months to get them familiar with the process. After that they can buy credits in - to encourage them to buy in advance, let's say a unit costs $50 - if they buy ten units in advance, it will cost $400. If they call without any credits, charge $60 per unit. (EDIT: Give units a life span of 30-60 days).</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> Record who you talked to, when, and the purpose of the call. If the same information is delivered more than once then the customer needs to educate their team unless they are happy spending units being told the same thing more than once. Also see note 6 below.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation</strong> You need to put stage gates - that calls will be answered between 0900/1700hrs for example, Monday to Friday, except not when it is a local holiday. You need explain that you will respond to a request for help within certain time frames (15mins/30mins/60mins) and that you will provide an answer within a certain time frame. You need also explain how you will compensate them if you fail to answer a valid question. Best award them credits to avoid breaking your bank.</li>
<li><strong>Encouragement</strong> To encourage your customers to adopt the new service, ask them to buy credits in advance. If they don't then your response will be best effort basis via email only.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancements</strong> Look at the reports (note 3 above) you create that record the most common problems/failures and enhance your product to reduce support calls. This should hopefully allow you to profit listening more to your customers needs, and potentially grow your client base.</li>
<li><strong>Get Liability Insurance</strong> If someone is using your product and you have licensed it to them, any loss to their business as a result of them using your product could result in your company being held liable. If you are a sole trader (meaning not incorporated company) then that holds you personally liable (your home, your credit rating). If incorporated, the company will be held liable (if the fault is deemed to be accidental) and the insurance will help. It's not expensive - I costed insurance last year at under $500 which covers me for service that excludes physical labour (thus I cannot lift a computer server etc - service of a mental capacity only). It covers me worldwide, $5million per incident.</li>

<li><p>Costs and expenses. Who covers the cost related to marketing your product? You, the Agent or is it split?</p></li>
<li><p>Commission/earnings on sales. What is the Agent entitled to and at what point in time? Does it decrease/increase in relation to sales volumes? Is it in perpetuity or for a limited time only?</p></li>
<li><p>Overall confidentiality. You should definitely define and set a limitation to what can be said; sales numbers, internal sales pitches, underlying functionality that is not proprietary but which could speed up competitor-development if the knowledge was shared etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Term &amp; termination to secure you from the Agent being able to give/sell/join the competition the day after termination of your contract. </p></li>
<li><p>Signatures from all involved parties.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So this a 'draft' setup for the minimum of sections you would include in a sales representative contract (Agent contract). Albeit some might seem overkill or useless at this point, you should at least consider if it would hurt the deal on your part, to include some beneficial regulations in each section anyway. It is better that they are there, in a broad definition rather than not at all.</p>

<p>Now to your considerations on commission.</p>

<p>There are several known models - they are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CPA. Cost per acquisition. You would calculate the average customer lifetime value (CLV) and what margin you have on this. From that margin, you would set a CPA that you find motivating for your Agent and which keeps you happy with your margins as well.</p></li>
<li><p>One-off commission in % of a sale. Ie. 10% (the larger the order, the larger the USD amount of commission)</p></li>
<li><p>Commission in perpetuity, in % or USD amount. If it is SaaS or similar monthly/yearly fee-based software, a commission on the monthly/yearly value can be set. As you said, this can be interchangeable - however, the industry standard is a fixed commission in either % or USD.</p></li>
<li><p>Stairway commission. When certain levels has been met, the commission either rises or falls (typically depending on whether it's a one-off or in perpetuity commission).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the cashflow in your business, you would probably be better of with a CPA-commission. This is expensive up front, but can secure a lot of freed cashflow later in your processes.</p>

<p>Hope it all makes sense.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

","<p>In business terms, what you're looking for are the beta customers for your app. They can be acquired in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Personal network and referrals</strong>: Ask people in your immediate personal networks to try the app, and also refer it to more people. It is one of the most effective ways of customer acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Communities/meetups in the domain</strong>: Attend meetups/community events in the domain of your app, and pitch your app to the attendees. This would both help you further build your network, as well as marketing and outreach for your app release.</li>

"Converting successful personal projects into Ltd company","172","","<p>I am a software engineer and in my spare time I like to make apps and build websites etc. The motivation has always been to make money but most of the projects I’ve worked on in the past have failed to do that.</p>

<p>Recently however, an app I made a while ago (~1 year) suddenly started generating sales. This rekindled my interest in writing apps and I’ve managed to churn out 3 in the last month.</p>

<p>Luckily these new apps are also making profit. I’m currently making around £150 per month, but in the next week I’m hoping to convert these from Android to iOS, which will hopefully double that figure.</p>

<p>I realise that these figures are small-fry and that this is still at the level of something that should be considered a hobby but I don’t think it’s unrealistic for me to make around 30 apps for both iOS and Android in the coming year, and if (big if!) I can replicate the success I’ve had so far, that might generate a significant profit.</p>

<p>I was wondering if I could get some advice about how I would go about forming a company from all these small projects, as they’re all currently published under my own name. For instance, my developer accounts with both Google and Apple are registered in my name, as are a couple of domain names.</p>

<p>Also, the apps already have sales figures, and reading HMRC and other government pages it says that a company is formed as soon as something generates sales. So how would I deal with historic app sales?</p>

<p>Also I was wondering about how best to structure the company? Is it even worth going Ltd or am I just opening myself up to unnecessary costs and taxes?</p>

<p>I also wouldn’t like to pigeon-hole myself into making one kind of app, so the name that I’m currently using – eduapp – wouldn’t be suitable. Could I form a company called Holding Company Ltd and then trademark the name eduapp and use that as a brand for certain apps?</p>

<p>I’d be really grateful for any advice I could get from people more experienced than me with this sort of thing!</p>
","<p>The first thing I would say is that you must seek qualified advice relevant to your jurisdiction (which is the UK, I assume). What follows has the caveat that it's <em>not</em> such advice!</p>

<p>If you're serious about building up a portfolio of apps, then doing that as a company makes a whole lot of sense. Yes, there are costs, but there are also significant benefits - often including tax advantages, access to support services available to businesses rather than individuals, a platform for growth, and last but not least, protection for you: in a worst case future scenario, it's the company and not you that goes down.</p>

<p>I don't think you're right that ""a company is formed as soon as something generates sales."" A company is a different legal entity than an individual. On my understanding, as an individual you are earning income, and presumably acquiring a tax liability, but you have the opportunity to incorporate, and as a sole founder, you don't have the complication of having to agree that with someone else, or any great hurdles in signing over the ownership of existing assets to the company.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures"" rel=""nofollow"">This link</a> is a good starting point for understanding the choices in the UK. I'd also recommend you find a local startup or entrepreneur meetup group to connect with other people with similar interests - for instance I'm in the Cambridge area and strongly recommend the weekly <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/CamPitchMix/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pitch &amp; Mix</a> meetup. It's great to learn from other people's experiences!</p>

"The Titanic's captain jumped ship and I'm holding the helm","172","","<p>Last year I was hired as a contractor in order to help a startup to finish their product (they were having a hard time hiring Python developers). The solo founder is filthy rich,  well connected and I'm making a modest profit.</p>

<p>One month from launch and the lead developer left (for their main competitor) and I'm holding the bag. Management is amateurish beyond description:</p>

<ul>
<li>product sucks (founder ignores feedback from team or early adopters)</li>
<li>market is crowded</li>
<li>high burn rate</li>
<li>micromanaged</li>
<li>amateurish</li>
<li>monetization strategy is lame</li>
<li>the list goes on, almost every item of my not-do list for startups is checked</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now 15 days from launch and it is impossible to dodge that iceberg.</p>

<p>They demand I keep playing the violin but I don't want to sink with the ship.</p>

<p>Have you ever faced similar situation or know someone who went through it? Can you share how it went and what would you do differently if you could go back in time? </p>

<p>[update]</p>

<p>The CTO left, not the CEO - perhaps ""holding the helm"" is the wrong metaphor. A key person left the team and I was assigned to his role, a position way more stressful than I signed up for.</p>
","<p>In that case, if you are taking a key position like substituting the CTO, some considerations are in order.</p>

<p>First you have to decide what kind of take-back and follow up you want to have in your resume about this experience.</p>

<p><strong>--This part is probably useful only to the Brazilian view of the question--</strong></p>

<p>I assume that you are in Brazil, like your profile says. The culture in our country is ill to entrepreneurship in the sense that not having tried is better than having tried and failed. But that is progressively changeing in the Startup ecosystem. Each day the US and foreign culture of receiving a failed attempt in as high regard as a successful attempt of establishing a new business is the rule in the Brazilian startup scene. But that is still far from the truth for the rest of society. A failure can be something frowned upon in many local circles, including in the industry that interests you.</p>

<p>The second consideration is local accountability of the company's executives. Brazilian legislation and judicial system are very hard on administrators of companies in the sense that in case the company declares bankruptcy, every one that holds (or acts like he holds, or even seems to hold) an administrative position (director in the board, or executive, or even shareholders when they have some powers like to approve high value expenses or contracts) will be drawn into very expensive and very slow litigations in the judicial system, and most likely be forbidden to hold administrative power in other companies while the lawsuit continues and even for a number of year after it concludes. Of course you can always prove your innocence if you had nothing to do with the facts that generated the bankruptcy, but it will cost you a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of explaining. By a lot of time I mean from 10 to 20 YEARS.</p>

<p>And don't you <strong>ever</strong> forget about labour-related lawsuits. They are the most damaging part of holding an administrative position in Brazil. Any labour-related lawsuit that a company might receive from employees, or even contractors that strategically request to be considered employees after the job is done, might be a direct hit on an executive or someone who looks like an executive. If you have not been there over-watching what goes on in labour-related actions (like contractors, extra hours of employees etc. etc. etc.) be very careful on accepting a position without some kind of guarantee against wrong legal demands. A judge will not hesitate to block your personal bank account and use it to pay for an employee lawsuit. That happens very fast, and if you were not really responsible for the damage, getting your money back will take you MANY YEARS, if at all possible, because you will be demanding the owner and the other executives for it, never the employee.</p>

<p><strong>--End of Brazil-specific part of the answer--</strong></p>

<p>That said, having chosen to get the be the helmsman and following the captain to whatever end, you need to receive correct and fair compensation for that key position.</p>

<p>Compensation on a Startup means more than just the money, but also a fair stock options package, and even a Founder status with a representative fraction of the property of the company.</p>

<p>If you can't get to terms on a negotiation, and that's probably also what you want by your statement, just demand a fair or even above-the-market payment for your services. What would be equivalent to the payment of this key-position not in a Startup (given that Startup incentives like stock options do much of the compensation for key-positions). Especially if that involves continuing the development work after launch.</p>

<p>As for negotiation, you can start getting your point noticed now, and agree to finish development work for the launch, but leave it clear that once launched, you need things to change. That will give the owner and the CEO enough time to sleep over your demands, or find a replacement. Either case seems to be an improvement over your current situation.</p>

What books/courses/... do you recommend for learning?</p>

<p>By working I mean working on the idea and trying to make it happen.
By learning I mean like reading a book. (not learning that comes from research on customers, that's work!)</p>
","<p>Here are some good sources for learning about entrepreneurship:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/articles.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Paul Graham's essays</strong></a>. Graham is the founder of the most successful startup incubator, Y Combinator, and one of the best writers and thinkers in the startup ecosystem. I also recommend his book, <em>Founders at Work</em>. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ben Horowitz's blog</a></strong>. Horowitz is a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, one of the newest and most successful VC firms. His new book, <em>The Hard Thing about Hard Things</em>, is also good. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to Build a Startup</strong>, a free online course by serial entrepreneur Steve Blank (I couldn't add a third link to this answer but you can Google for the class). Blank helped pioneer the concept of customer development - of ""getting outside the building"" to talk to customers and identify needs before plunging into developing product.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I recommend <strong>spending 1-3 months on learning</strong> about entrepreneurship and whether it's for you before starting to execute an idea. Entrepreneurship is a very challenging (and very rewarding) career choice. It's seen as glamorous but many people do not have the personality, skills, or dedication to be successful entrepreneurs. If you are mainly looking to make a lot of money, strongly reconsider since entrepreneurship requires more work with less guaranteed returns than most other careers.</p>

<p>If you decide entrepreneurship is a good fit, <strong>start exploring industries and problems</strong> that align with your passions and skills. Talk with people in those fields about problems they want solved. Don't suggest solutions at first, <strong>just ask questions and listen</strong>. Interesting solutions will come to you as you learn more about the problems.</p>

<p>You'll also want to <strong>network in the startup community</strong> to meet potential co-founders, mentors, and eventually investors. What events to attend will depend on your area but many cities now have startup meetups and events. You can also <strong>try contacting founders</strong> of startups in your area to meet for advice. I've found many experienced entrepreneurs will meet with aspiring founders who ask thoughtfully for help (ask specific questions, listen well, offer to help if you can).</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"How to approach question about the size of your market if you are not entering existing market segment but creating new one?","171","","<p>In the How to Start a Startup course, lecture 19, YC partner Michael Seibel <a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec19/"" rel=""nofollow"">talks about how to talk to investors</a>. He stresses out the importance of knowing the size of your market. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Don't skip this up. Second sentence. How big is your market?"" [Michael Seibel]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how do you approach this question if you are not entering existing market? For instance what would Twitter or Reddit or even GitHub say in this situation? They did not disrupt existing market segment, they created a new one. </p>
","<p>So there's two types of knowledge that we deal with on an everyday basis:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>A priori knowledge</em> or that which is deduced (rooted in reason)</li>
<li><em>A posteriori knowledge</em> or that which is observed (rooted in empirical evidence)</li>
</ol>

<p>Naturally, you're dealing with the first because your market doesn't exist so you'll have to make <em>some</em> kind of inference or deduction that is not rooted in observation. </p>

<p>Since your market does not exist, it is purely theoretical and like any theory, you need to justify it. Starting from first principles, you ought to ask yourself some questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a market?</li>
<li>Why doesn't my market exist?</li>
<li>Why do people need what I'm offering?</li>
<li>If my product / service was offered tomorrow, and everyone magically knew about it, how many people would use it?</li>
</ul>

<p>The last should give you a theoretical answer to your theoretical question, or at least start to get you going down the right direction. </p>

<p>Your claims are somewhat questionable too. What do you mean GitHub created a new market? I'm sure there were source code control before GitHub. Reddit created a new market? What about digg, and all other media sites that linked to articles before Reddit? If anything, Reddit re-segmented the news market. Twitter's ""market"" is the social market, of which there were many before it. They merely had a different approach. You can argue they re-segmented the market by focusing on the 180 characters or less niche, but even still, are you really saying that the ability for humans to communicate did not exist as a market beforehand? It's all in how you define ""market""</p>

","<p>Amazing answers, but none seem to convince you. Isnt it?</p>

<p>I have been in startup for about two years and here is my take, </p>

<p>To build up a startup, you may start working at startup as a programmer and then you may push your self little harder to jump in the following way</p>

<p>Developer
Lead Developer
Tech Lead
CTO
CIO
CEO or CoFounder or Director</p>

<p>I joined a start up as a lead, and then become CTO as I had management and programming skills. I started building my own team and thats how i have progressed. As of now, I left the startup to build my own. During the journey, I become</p>

<p>Better Developer
Better Thinker, Innovator
Better Leader
Better Manager and also a businessman.</p>

<p>As you have mentioned that you haven't known about business this process will actually help you. Or may be you will invent better.</p>

<p>This is completely personal view. And comments are welcomed.</p>

","<p>This is mentioned in a book called ""The Lean Startup"" by Eric Reis in page 33.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Products change constantly through the process of optimization,
  what I call tuning the engine. Less frequently, the strategy may have
  to change (called a pivot). However, the overarching vision rarely
  changes. Entrepreneurs are committed to seeing the startup through

  how to get where they want to go (see the chart below).</p>

"What to do with a software product that will go outdated soon, but was aquired practically free (including sources and ownership rights)","169","","<p>I worked in the past as an IT manager, overseeing the development process of a distributed IT-infrastructure management system for an angel investor. A system was developed, and is now out of beta. Both the investors and the developing company never did anything to market the product, introducing it to potential license buyers with direct contacts. </p>

<p>Now, the company has been faced with financial problems and had to abandon the project. Ownership right has been legally transfered to my startup company. Because of that, I now have a product that I personally believe is able to gain a market share if marketed to the right potential buyers.</p>

<p>However, my current main business focus is on another, unrelated product that my company is developing.</p>

<p>What might be my best approach moving forward with the product rights I inherited from previous company?</p>

<p>I'm thinking I have four main options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Abandon it completely.</li>
<li><p>Try to sell it.</p>

<p>Is there a market where I can present and try to sell an entire product?</p></li>
<li><p>Try to get investors for it to basically not develop, but focus on marketing.</p>

<p>Where would I look for those?</p></li>
<li><p>Put it to be open-source and try to sell a commercial version.</p>

<p>Then perhaps try to market it myself after I gain a foot on the market and money with the main product of focus my company has at the moment? </p></li>
</ol>
","<p>You need to be very hard-nosed about this. Your working assumption is that the product's greatest potential value was to the developing company, and if they have access to funding but have abandoned the project, prudence tells you not to put your company at risk by over-investing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you have an opportunity. You have an asset that could be valuable, but it's rusting: every month you sit on it, it's going to be worth less. And the long sales cycle that's typical in your industry makes this worth.</p>

<p>Here's what I would do.</p>

<p>First I would <strong>create a capability list</strong>. By <em>capability</em> I mean a feature or a cluster of features that translates to solving a single problem within infrastructure management.</p>

<p>Then I would <strong>draw up a list of competitors</strong>, and do a rough job of rating them against each capability.</p>

<p>Look over what you've done, and find one, two or a very few places where you see that <strong>you have a potentially strong value proposition.</strong> If you have choices, prioritize the cases where a customer would see significant value fast.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>for your best case, create a sales page, focused extremely narrowly.</strong> Invest a modest amount of money in PPC, and see what you generate in terms of enquiries and other measures. Any enquiries you should treat as customer development. Engage the prospect based not on the total system you have, or on their wider need, but on the narrow description. </p>

<p>You're likely to find out one of three things.</p>

<p>Possibly, you just won't get any serious interest. Chances are, that's going to suggest you mothball the project.</p>

<p>Or you may find that you get interest, but you can't keep the focus narrow. That's a cue to find an partner - most likely a small but credible enterprise solution provider who isn't tied to a competitor. You can come up with a deal that would be attractive for them while avoiding any unpaid development work for you.</p>

<p>Or if you're lucky, you may have found a route in to the market based on a more compact set of capabilities than you have on hand, and the beginning of understanding why customers might value that. If that happens, you have a startup opportunity, which you could pursue alongside other activities, or standalone, or as an empty shell to recruit a ""late stage founder"" team to take forward.</p>

"When sales start slow, should we try and implement every demands from our first/potential clients?","169","","<p>For the past 2 years, I have been working on a web application for my company, which provides a standardized e-commerce site aimed for a very specific market with specific regulations. The sales model would be based on a subscription fee, so clients would be paying for a continuous service. (<strong>Saas</strong>)</p>

<p>At the beginning of the project, a strong emphasis was put on <strong>industrialization</strong>: we needed a website that could be slightly customizable (mostly design: colors, fonts, pictures...), so it could be redistributed as-is to all clients, and benefit from updates from the codebase automatically: we'd just have to push updates to all clients, ignoring the custom stylesheet.</p>

<p>We launched the product, sales did not start flowing in... so our sales department started pandering to every demand of potential buyers: this meant that I had to add very specific and opinionized features (features that definitely a minor subsets of clients would want) to the codebase, <strong>all while ensuring that these features could be opted-in/opted-out by future clients</strong>, and in a very short delay since negotiations were running fast at the time.</p>

<p>This was harsh, but acceptable at the time since we did not have any running instance yet ; but nowadays I am feeling a twinge of regret. Because now we have one client with an instance running, and the company keeps dealing with these kinds of demands and asking me to implement them.</p>

<p>I feel like this is going against the fundamental idea behind our product: if we are going to tailor each and every site like it is the client's own, maybe we should start charging them for <em>an actual standalone website</em>, and not a subscription fee. Because all of these custom changes add up, and create a monstrous codebase for handling future updates and bug fixes, and making sure that one client's demand does not overlap another client's.</p>

<p>With all these things considered, I cannot help but sympathize with my company for wanting to get clients at any cost to get the project running. I am just worried that <strong>there is currently no line being drawn</strong>, and I do not seem to be able to communicate that feeling to them. I keep telling them ""this goes against our model, you wouldn't call the Wordpress team and ask them to add <em>a field for adding silly pop-up ads on the top-left corner of iPad screens only</em>"" (intentional exaggeration). But we are a launching company, so I guess this is a different situation.</p>

<p>What is your take on this, and do you have any advice to give, whether technical and/or communication-related? Is it a bold move to say <em>""no""</em> to customers <a href=""http://diginomica.com/2013/12/03/true-saas-box-long-black/"" rel=""noreferrer"">like Henry Ford did</a>, when the company is struggling to get clients?</p>
","<p>You are in very complicated situation. I have been there myself but it was not that grave.</p>

<p>Let me share what would be my line of thinking if I find myself in it again today.</p>

<p>In first place you have to take into account you are not the authoritative person doing product vision or decisions (there are some sort of ""business"" guys, right?) so any fight you might pick with the subject matter experts would be very disruptive and nonconstructive. Going against the wisdom of the sales/product teams and vetoing or worse — refuting their roadmap is justified only if you are prepared to go into ""take no prisoners"" offense.</p>

<p>What you could do is provide feedback (ideally cost, in $) for what these decisions mean short and long term. This is uphill battle as well, but at least you are authority on what you are discussing and you are not the challenging party. If you manage to translate it into hopes and fears (excuse me, ""opportunities"" and ""liabilities"") important to the business/sales people — excellent. </p>

<p>Once you have done the job above, all you can do is hope that your partners will be open to revise their view of the situation and consider your feedback constructively (even if they do don't expect miracles). If this is not the case (and it seems you guys have entered an ""escalation of commitment"" loop already) you have in general two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>dial it up — scream louder that doom is approaching, threaten to quit, so on... hoping that somebody influential will panic, grab the steering wheel and avoid the iceberg</li>
<li>vote with your feet. Quit if you see they won't listen to you xor stay with the clear understanding that you are executing strategy you disagree with. If you choose the second option do your best not to act as a victim.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case this line of thinking is relevant for you I can work further on elaborating tactics for providing the feedback. </p>

<p>Overall you appear to have kept you head cool and this is the most important precondition for getting out of such situation.</p>

"How do I start a business as a minor?","168","","<p>Assuming I have the resources, either via savings, income, funding, etc. -- and I'm still legally a minor within the UK (or the US), how do I legally start a business. To be more clear, what factors as a minor would I need to address and plan for that an adult would not?</p>
","<p>Mostly legal issues, with liability and taxes. Those are two of the key areas you should research that will have the biggest impact. The exact law can vary from country to country and state to state, though there are a lot of similarities.</p>

<p>Minors would not be legally liable in a contract. So no-one in their right mind would enter into a contract where only they are liable and the other party (the minor) is not.</p>

<p>Normally a legal guardian acts on behalf of the minor in all legal situations. This means the guardian (e.g. your parents) could be liable for any debts you incur in running the business.</p>

<p>When forming a business an adult considers whether the business is the type that is likely to incur debts when they choose whether to incorporate a Limited Liability Company (LLC) that will offer them some protection or operate as a self-employed person or ""sole traider"". e.g. are they trying to form the next Facebook, baby sitting, teaching English etc. What is the financial and legal risk involved.</p>

<p>The law in the region you live then defines what your responsibilities would be in the type of business you form and what your guardians responsibilities would be. e.g. whether you could be a director etc.</p>

<p>In the USA it seems the factor determining whether you need to file taxes is income based rather than age based:

"Let customers pre-order products online without having them in stock already?","166","","<p>I am starting a greeting cards company. Right now I am done with the website and almost ready to print my cards (which will probably be ready in 2-3 weeks). I am planning on printing 12,000 cards first (40 versions, so 300 of each). </p>

<p>My question is: Does it makes sense that I launch my website now and let people pre-order? Until I get the cards? One benefit I see is that I would get an idea of what people like. I will be able to get user feedback which I can use to modify what cards I will print before actually printing them. </p>

<p>What do you guys think? Are there any other benefits or drawbacks?</p>
","<p>Launching a website prior to production can be very beneficial. You probably have seen the ""Coming Soon"" signs at brick and mortar retail stores. Launching early will allow you to put key words in search sites like Google etc. It also, as Dawny33 says, can help you gauge your market, however 2 to 3 weeks lead time is very short as the general public probably will not find you quickly.</p>

<p>You might take more than the 2 to 3 weeks lead time to have your production up and running due to the small number of initial viewers of your site, you will have. To take the time, I recommend a large notice you are ""coming soon"" and you are not currently open. A projected  date of opening would also be beneficial. You need to delay opening until you think you will some sales. That is purely a judgement call. To maintain interest of earlier viewers, you might have a numbered 10 % coupon. (Numbered to insure it can only be used once.)You can also ask your early viewers to choose a particular card or cards they like so it will be on hand for them when you do open. Remember your site is brand new and you will more than likely have only a small trickle of initial customers.</p>

<p>You can use the additional time to reserve some of your capital. Rather than outlaying capital for the same number of each card, you can do as you proposed by having a larger supply of the pre-selected cards and a lesser supply of those that aren't.</p>

<p>I think the number of cards you are planning to print is exceptionally high, unless it will months to receive reprinting orders. You might want to visit a retail store and ask the number of each card they have in stock. You should correlate that number with your reorder time. I would spend some time estimating your just-in-time inventory and raise it just a few percentage points for uncertainty. You don't want to have a large number of cards that don't sell. It is not a bad thing for a new business to have some cards on back-order. It is fine as long as you know when the back-orders will be received. A significant under-estimate or actual back-order time will probably cause you to lose that customer. Please don't think, ""its just one customer"". In your opening days your best advertising will be word of mouth. By losing one customer, you are loosing many potential customers. </p>

<p>I personally would not have pre-orders. With a new store and customer types you know little about, the chances of pre-orders being canceled are significant. I don't think you want to get stuck with expected sales not happening. And if you are thinking of prepayment, the chances of it for a new store are slim.</p>

<p>I think you should check out your competition, other website card shops. Since you are the new kid on the block, you need to do what they do, but different. You can try to piggy back their method of getting customers (if you can figure it out), but differentiate your store. Make it have easier to check-out or have better customer service or something else. Remember to ask for your customer's email address so you can send them advertising. Tell them that your advertising will not be overwhelming (and stick to it). You need to do everything you can to get your store known.</p>

"What are the duties and responsibilities of a CXO in a company?","165","","<p>CXO: Chief Experience Officer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A chief experience officer (CXO) is the officer responsible for the
  overall user experience (UX) of an organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is he/she different from a senior frontend engineer? </p>

<p>And when(at what stage and with what motive) should a company look to hire a CXO?</p>
","<p>Pay attention to the highlighted part: </p>

<p>The Chief Experience Officer (CXO) is charged with leveraging best practices in design and user experience to <strong>gain market share</strong>. That's it.</p>

<p>So, although a senior front-end engineer will apply all knowledge and skill needed to build a beautiful product, the CXO will run specific A/B tests, hire design firms and <strong>experience researches</strong>, manage <strong>user experience labs</strong> with several prototypes and, the most important, put everyone <strong>under the same umbrella</strong>.</p>

<p>The CXO will apply a <strong>methodological approach</strong> in order to achieve the highest rates of downloads, good rating and user feedback. <strong>It's a good balance between theory and practice</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best CXOs has technical expertise in an addition of ability to present and discuss
  theories and scenarios (backed by numbers) with CMO, CFO, CEO and
  investors. Sometimes, the front-end engineer would rather die than explaining his motives and rationale to the business guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>About timing</strong></p>

<p>The CXO would be valuable when the startup is <strong>shifting from MVP mode to growth mode</strong> quickly. </p>

<p>If you can get a CXO early on with equity, then do it. But if you are still strugling to launch your MVP, I don't see how a CXO would be beneficial - once you have bigger problems to deal with.</p>

<p>There are some similarities in terms of when to hire the CXO and the CMO as well, so here are some situations where a CXO would be extremely useful to your startup:</p>

<p><strong>1. When You Need to Put Your Product First</strong></p>

<p>A good CXO can't save a bad product, but (s)he can take an OK product to the next level and make it better through proper market research and customer feedback.</p>

<p><strong>2. When You Need to Grow</strong> </p>

<p>When you’re not growing at a pace you need in order to be an industry leader or provide the returns your investors are looking for, it's time to think about hiring a CXO. (S)he will bring invaluable inputs on how to make your product better and, as result, grow on market share.</p>

<p><strong>3. When You Found the Company</strong></p>

<p>Hiring a CXO is becoming as important as hiring a CMO or CTO. From surveying users to scaling the company, a CXO is critical for not just the later stages, but also the early stages of your company. To some degree, a CXO is more important at the earlier stages of your development than the later ones because having the right groundwork early can mean the difference between a company that accelerates at <strong>20 percent a month</strong> and a company that accelerates at <strong>5 percent</strong>.</p>

","<p>Titles only really matter for a few formal situations. For example, some laws might require ""an officer"" to sign a corporate agreement. Other laws might require a corporation to report people in certain corporate roles yearly. In those rare circumstances, you need to maintain the required title(s). Other than that, titles are mainly used to stroke people's egos. They are also often used as an employment incentive because they cost companies nothing to give out but are valued highly by employees.</p>

"Getting Funding For Your Project","164","","<p>I have a business idea that I believe will do really well.  Instead of pitching the idea, I want to pitch the business side of it.  This is what I think investors want to see. Let me know if I'm the right track.</p>

<ul>
<li>They want to see that I have customers already for my product (even if the product does not exist).  For example, getting an AUTH on the credit cards of people interested in the idea ready to pay if I get the X amount of funding to finance said project.</li>
<li>I have a proven strategy to get new customers for said product/service.  The amount of money I spend on the advertising strategy + maintaining product/service is low enough that I take a significant profit margin.  Lets say 30%+.  This includes a financial projection based on these stats.</li>
<li>The idea can scale and grow over time without my own time or effort through proper management techniques.  For example, like how a franchise can expand through the concept of master franchisee's which train your other franchisee's in return for a percentage.  This saves my time to focus on the business instead of the business day to day tasks.</li>
<li>They want to see that I have put my own time and money into the idea to show commitment.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I'm missing anything please let me know.  If I were investing anyways I would want to see these factors... even more than the idea (whatever it may be).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The advantage to traditional funding would be the expertise that could be provided by the investor and since my particular business idea is more targeted at business to business I'm not sure it would work in a crowd funded scenario, not sure what I could offer the average person. I have to think it out further. Traditional investors could also offer the capital I need then in this case to expand further, through advertising, hiring staff etc.</p>
","<p>More than anything, they want to see the real product!</p>

<p>No need to be a fully completed and working version, but at least the <strong>MVP - Minimum Viable Product</strong>. </p>

<p>I can't stress this enough: NO ONE WILL EVER INVEST IN IDEAS ON POWER POINT. </p>

<p>No matter how good it is. </p>

<p>So, what to do then if you have a really good idea?</p>

<p>I'd suggest you to do one of those two things:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Develop the product yourself</strong> (MVP)</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Find a technical partner to develop it for you</strong> (you know: 50% equity, no salary)</p>

<p>Regardless of the option you choose, you'll have some homework to do.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> Don't put so much expectation on the quality of advise you would get from investors. Only a few percentage of them will really pay attention to your business (even if they have invested a huge amount of money on it).</p>

I have a few options and would like some advice as to which to take.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Partner</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I have a good friend who is more than capable to handle what I need. I think if I asked him, he'd definitely be willing to help, and we could form a partnership. However I've had a lot of people about getting into business with a friend. </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>Employee</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I live next to a university, and at any given time dozens of new graduates are looking for employment. I could easily hire one of them part-time, the problem becomes how to pay them. I haven't made any money yet, as this has just been a pet project.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Intern</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The last option would be to get an unpaid intern. Lots of students are looking for an internship position at the university, and it is required for them to graduate. The problem with this approach is that anyone good will get a paid internship, so I would get someone who isn't qualified.</p>

<p>Any help with making this decision would be greatly appriciated, Thanks!</p>
","<p>I speak from experience, and I have taken upon all three positions you have mentioned into my company.</p>

<p>Be careful who you partner with, it may mean them doing a fair amount of the work that you could have possibly done yourself, or it may mean that your business operations excel to a stage at which wouldn't have been possible without them. Calculate this before making a decision.</p>

<p>Employees, if they're not going to be taking too much capital out of the business, then definitely hire them. They work well if you correctly assess their skills and capabilities, so once again, calculate the risk and the benefits, and weight them accordingly.</p>

<p>Finally, interns. My favourite. I'm a university startup for the gaming industry, so landing interns was a major breeze for me. Not only do they get to work on something ""cool"", they were getting work experience. These students are working for you for FREE, so be careful in how you handle it. People burn out quickly, especially if they feel devalued often. Nurture their growth and education, cater it to suit their schedules and skills, and make sure you keep the internship an enjoyable experience. I'm still a university student, and I know that students discuss companies where their experience was terrible (I would know, I was one of those students). One thing though, one of our interns contributed a significant amount of code to the project, and is being moved into a paid position as he has satisfactorily completed his internship.</p>

<p>To summarise though, calculate all decisions and weight the benefits with the risks. You don't want to mess up bringing in someone, it's a major pain and can cause many problems down the line.</p>

"Vesting Stock Options or Restricted Stock?","161","","<p>I realize that, for small software startups, the future is by far the most compelling incentive. Namely, the goal of making a platform or application that is eventually bought out by a major company, due to its attraction of users etc., which provides a vision for each shareholder - monetization.</p>

<p>As a founder, my company is currently an S-Corp, and we have a few employees working on W2s.

<p>Since our company is still at zero revenue, which makes more sense?</p>

<p>Granting stock options that vest over time, or restricted stock? Our par value per share is still negligible,  so something makes me think that stock options are favorable.</p>

<p>Bonus points - What's the real difference, and why is the standard practice for large corporations to use restricted stock (and by extension, when does a company become large enough that they make this transition - an IPO?)</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
","<p>I would go with restricted stock. It allows you to put certain criteria on your stock that must be met before it is released including a vesting time frame. So instead of just an investing timeframe you can add additional criteria the must be met before it is released.</p>

<p>It is a very common situation that within a year quite a few people in the start up would have given up and gone and you don't want them taking stock with them. Start ups are a hard game and many don't have the grit for it. If you give stock it needs to come under very heavy conditions initially in my opinion and make sure that they are in it for the long term and contribute significantly for it.</p>

I set it up this way to attract more users so that they will worrying about paying for a service if it does not work for them and want to keep it this way for now.  I know I am taking a big risk by allowing this to happen and want to plan for the few customers that may not pay.</p>

<p>I am planning on sending customers with amounts past due for more than 30 days a letter that states my company has a policy for customers that are past due.  I want to state I will report amounts past due if they remain unpaid for more than 90 days to Trans Union, Equifax, and Experian and resend that letter again if unpaid after 60 days, then final letter at 90 days and actually report.</p>

<p>I went to each credit reporting website and requested information from each but did not find a simple form to fill out to submit an unpaid amount.  Has anyone actually done this?</p>

<p>Lastly, if a customer does not pay after 180 days, I do not think it would be worthwhile to continue trying to collect and am not planning on suing them.  I will probably forgive this amount but feel that the customer should not have used the services for free.  I would like to report a 1099-C to the IRS because the customer did not pay and then they will have to report the value of the service as income.  I am not sure if this is allowable because my business is not a lender and financial institutions are <strong>required</strong> to file <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099ac/ar02.html#d0e280"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS Form 1099-C</a>, but the site does not say if other institutions are <strong>allowed</strong> to file.  Anyone know if non-financial institutions are allowed to file this form?</p>

<p>I understand this is more of a legal questions and I do have a counsel retained, but they are only familiar suing customers to recover past debts and not with these methods.</p>
","<p>1099-C is a cancellation of debt. This is used when a loan is not being repaid and is being written off (either fully or partially, most commonly in cases of foreclosures or short sales in real estate).</p>

<p>You provided services with allowing customers not to pay for them, and then you're trying to charge them and treat the customers that refuse to pay as if they took a loan from you. You then go on and and report the discharge of the loan by filing the 1099-C.</p>

<p>However, there was no loan. No customer promised any payment to you - you allowed them to use your service without paying.</p>

<p>If you're a cash-based taxpayer - you didn't recognize any income at all, so there's nothing to discharge. If you're an accrual-based taxpayer, you only recognize income when you invoice the customers, but customer not paying your invoice is not necessarily in your debt. He didn't agree to the charge to begin with, so you can't claim debt until there's a judgement in your favor.</p>

<p>In any case, you cannot report a debt discharge to the IRS unless there's <em>no chance</em> of collecting the debt. If you don't even try to sue the people who you claim owe you money, I don't think you can satisfy that requirement.</p>

<p>Bottom line, as I said in the comment - talk to a lawyer that can explain this to you. If your current lawyer doesn't understand what a debt discharge is and how it is reported - then you should fire that lawyer and find another one.</p>

<p>Do not engage in such a predatory practice without an <strong>excellent</strong>, nothing less, legal counsel.</p>

"Should I join Microsoft's imagine cup?","159","","<p>I'm a computer science student. I'm doing some robotics project, I have plans for many, I'm finishing them one by one and I already have an investor and people helping me, so I don't need anyone.</p>

<p>Few days ago, an engineering student (I don't know what kind of engineering, didn't ask) asked me to join his team, they are 3 members and he needs one more and will apply to imagine cup, I said no thank you but he insisted.</p>

<p>The thing is I don't know what this cup is and I'm a Linux user and from what I've seen they only give $50,000 to the winner, divide that by 4 and it's $12,500. And we have to invest in the project from our own money so the net profit, if any, is much less than that.</p>

<p>I believe that my project could be sold for much more than that, at least I'll have my own company.</p>

<p>I told that to the guy who asked me to join, He would  like me to join him on another project so that we apply for that cup, I have  many ideas and willing to do them all on my own and am lucky to have the greatest investor and team of all,  if I ever apply to the cup, I won't ask my team nor my investor to help me.</p>

<ul>
<li>So should I consider competing for Microsoft cup? what's in it for
me? Is it better to continue doing what I'm doing with my team, not
caring about the competition?</li>
<li>Will Microsoft sell my idea as if it was their own or will it still be mine?</li>
<li>Is their anything in it for me career-wise? Is the cup worth dedicating your time to?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I don't know much (anything) about this competition, but here goes.</p>

<p>For formatting's sake, I'll put my conclusion at the top:</p>

<p>I definitely think you should consider it, barring exceptional circumstances. I've known a few people who have gotten picked up by companies after meeting executives at those kinds of events, and even if you want to stay on your own path, that's not a bad position to be in. Beyond that, you'll undoubtedly learn from the process, and I don't really see what you stand to <em>lose</em> by doing it. Of course, I don't know your full story, so do take into account your circumstances.</p>

<p>If you aren't willing (that sounds harsh, I don't mean for it to be) to work on your main project, it's just a matter of how relevant time-to-market is for that. I think you will gain from taking part in the competition, even for an unrelated matter, but if that would take you away from valuable market time, you probably won't gain enough. Again, that's really just up to you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So should I consider competing for Microsoft cup? what's in it for me? Is it better to continue doing what I'm doing with my team, not caring about the competition?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I neither can, nor do I want to, tell you whether to take part in it, or whether it's worth dedicating time towards. That's really up to you.</p>

<p>But that said, I would seriously consider it. You say ""they only give $50,000 to the winner, divide that by 4 and it's $12,500,"" which may not be a lot, but if you're currently living the standard startup life, that's probably more income than you'd have investing your time just working. If you can continue to work on what you're doing, and get guidance from mentors that Microsoft will presumably supply (as is standard at such events), and you get publicity, that could be very good for your business.</p>

<p>You also mentioned having to invest in your own project, which I'm not sure I completely understand. Why would you have to spend $50,000 by entering that you wouldn't otherwise have had to spent?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will Microsoft sell my idea as if it was their own or will it still be mine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did a bit of research, and came across <a href=""https://www.imaginecup.com/Blog/Details/learning-about-intellectual-property"">this Microsoft Blog post from 2013</a>. It explains the IP implications pretty well, so I won't get into many details, but ultimately no. You'll own all the rights that you'd probably expect.</p>

<p><a href=""https://iccms.blob.core.windows.net/content/IC15%20Official%20Rules%20and%20Regulations-11262b519900.pdf"">From their official rules for this year</a> (starting on the second half of page 8),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>HOW WILL MY ENTRY POTENTIALLY BE USED?<br/></strong>
  Other than what is set forth below, we are not claiming any ownership rights to your entry. However, by submitting your entry, you:</p>
  
  <ul>

  <li>Understand that we cannot control the incoming information you will disclose to our representatives in the course of entering, or what our representatives will remember about your entry.

By entering this Competition, you agree that use of information in our representatives unaided memories in the development or deployment of our products or services does not create liability for us under this agreement or copyright or trade secret law;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of bullet points under that which you should review, but essentially, they're taking the rights they need to promote the competition (if they take a picture of you working on your project, they can publish it, that kind of thing), and they aren't claiming any liability if people remember your project and steal the idea.</p>

<p>Per usual, the only way to be protected here is to get your IP protection (patents, mostly) <em>before</em> the competition begins. You may still have a claim after it does, but you'll risk many if not all of your rights by doing a public disclosure. Not to mention, if someone else files for your inventions before you do, the most you may be able to do is invalidate their patent.</p>

<p>I'll go with my usual ""you might want to speak with a patent professional before proceeding, to establish what if anything you would like to protect.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is their anything in it for me career-wise? Is the cup worth dedicating your time for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd offer a hesitant ""yes."" Again, I don't know much about it, but I figure you have two major advantages if you take part:</p>

<ul>
<li>It could look good on a résumé that you took part in such an event.</li>
<li>Networking.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first point may or may not matter to you, depending on what you intend to do with your life, but the second one should. As for résumés, it probably won't tell any companies that you're good (although some might draw that conclusion), but it will tell that you're involved in the community, which, to companies I respect at least, generally counts for a lot.</p>

<p>Speaking back to the point of money, it's very possible that you'd meet someone there that could expand your business beyond what it would otherwise accomplish. That can be a great investment. At the very least, if you try, you'll almost undoubtedly learn something.</p>

"What is the ballpark total cost to register an LLC in Texas?","159","","<p>I found information about <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/texas-form-llc-31745.html"" rel=""nofollow"">filing fees</a> that indicates it would cost $340 to file in Texas.</p>

<p>However, that's not the full cost, as a lawyer is necessary to draft a basic <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/llc-operating-agreement-30232.html"" rel=""nofollow"">operating agreement</a> and there may be other fees I'm unaware of.</p>

<p>What would be a rough estimate of the cost for registering an LLC in the state of Texas (i.e. $340 + lawyer + unknown fees)?</p>
","<p>The main registration costs you will face are initial filing fees, lawyer fees and registered agent fees. It's impossible to give a decent an estimate on how much it will cost for you without having specific details on your needs. It's entirely possible that your startup could be registered for less than $340 though.</p>

<p>The initial filing fees are the only thing you really can't go without. It costs $300 in Texas and may be more or less in other states. </p>

<p>You may want to reserve the name of your LLC which costs $40 in Texas. This is only necessary if you need to reserve it before registering your LLC. You automatically claim a name if it's available when you register your LLC. You can easily save $40 here by not filing extra paperwork.</p>

<p>Paying a lawyer to draft an Operating Agreement is nearly impossible to estimate since the costs of lawyers varies and depends on how complex your agreement needs to be. This document dictates how your LLC governs itself and can be written up by your co-founders. There are plenty of templates and articles about Operating Agreements out there you can work with. Lawyers get expensive very quickly, so I'd advise against paying for them here unless you really need it.</p>

<p>All Texas LLCs require a registered agent. This can be a corporation or Texas resident (you can designate yourself, assuming you live in the state.) If you want to pay for a registered agent service, some of them offer the first year for free after which the price jumps to around $100/ year.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd recommend taking the cheap options, unless you have a special need. If that works for you, it comes out to $300 to register an LLC in Texas.</p>

"Company Name - Copyright / Trade Mark","158","","<p>I want to start a company in the UK - for now lets say I want to call it 'Super Sour Sweet Shop' (Just an example) and want the url supersoursweetshop.com which is available.</p>

<p>'Copyright all rights reserved 2013'</p>

<p>These sites have no other content other than a logo and copyright notice.</p>

<p>There is currently no business registered with this name at Companies House in the UK and also no relevant trade marks registered with the UK Intellectual Property Office.</p>

<p>If I was to start the business, is there any chance I could be infringing the copyright or a trade mark of the owner of the .co.uk and .net domains?</p>
","<p>I'm not an attorney.</p>

<p>The Copyright notice is protecting the content of the site itself, but it does not establish ""trademark"" rights on any marks or media. In other words, don't plagiarize or repurpose their content. </p>

<p>If you see something like ""Super Sour Sweet Shop™"" (with the little ""TM"" notice), now it is time to pay close attention. If you see that, then talk to a UK-based attorney for sure (not that you shouldn't anyhow). </p>

<p>Also, do a double check on the USPTO.gov website to make sure no one in the US has established trademark protection for the same words or logos, just to be safe. Every now and again a major corporation (which may have hundreds of trademarks/slogans/logos) will have something out there. Even though the mark may only be registered in the US, they could still be a serious nuisance to a fragile startup. </p>

<p>Anyhow, if I were you and based in the US, I would begin using the word mark or logo with the ""TM"" always attached <strong>immediately</strong> in some business correspondences. Email a prospect with the word mark and ""TM"" in the email and establish a ""first use in commerce"" date of today. Then I'd register the mark, wait six months or so to see if any opposition comes up, get it Registered (R), and then be on my way. </p>

"What percentage of my business should I give to an angel?","158","","<p>This is my first post here and I'm not well versed in venture and angel investments, so sorry if my question is too <em>naive</em> or stupid.</p>

<p>Anyways, my situation is as follows: I own a company that has developed and patented a system with the potential of earning 10 figures in a 10 years lapse. Please note that <strong>this potential has been properly measured by all parts involved</strong> and is based on prototype testing and publicly available info (its application would be by the government of my country), so there's no questions about this: <strong>we all agree on this potential, even the investor.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when we went to money talks, the <em>angel</em> offered 100k (US dollars) and he would bring a friend to add another 100k. For that , he requires 33% for each of them. Also, he would add something very important for us: <em>contacts (so it's a hands-on angel)</em>. However, <strong>that would mean to give up the company right from the start</strong>. Also, that kind of money isn't a big issue for me, I could simply sell one of my homes (but of course, if I can avoid the risk, then better).</p>

<p>The only REAL thing that matters that he might add and <strong>I know I need</strong> is <em>contacts</em>. And because of the nature of this system, this addition is of <strong>utmost importance</strong>. However, if even with these contacts the projects doesn't work, then I'd be at bar 0, only that having giving my company.</p>

<p>One thing to note: <strong>as big as the potential of this project is, without government authorization it's worth 0</strong> (then again, it can be split in cities or provinces, so if it fails at national level, we could go smaller, or even try other countries, thus that <em>zero worth</em> is relative)</p>

<p>I'm already declining his friend's involvement. But even then, 33% for 100k on a project that even the investor agreed is a gold mine looks extremely off base. Even considering his <em>contacts</em> contribution. </p>

<p>I took a read to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/26337/what-to-ask-for-on-a-business-partnership""><strong>this post</strong></a> which makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't consider that I'm adding everything while the other part adds a minimum amount of capital (and yes, the contacts). And I profoundly disagree that ideas are worth nothing, but just in case, we don't only have ideas, but also patents and around 60% of the project already done. IN general, I'm more inclined to the <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/6215/what-should-i-offer-to-someone-who-wants-to-invest-into-my-business""><strong>advise provided here</strong></a> in the answer by Trenton Tyler</p>

<h1>So my question is:</h1>

<p><strong>is this kind of percentage for that kind of money realistic? What kind of percentage should I agree on? Or should I arrange that same percentage only with a bigger amount of money?</strong> (Again, money is not an issue for me, so I'm not very prone to this)</p>

<h1>Addendum</h1>

<p>Of course I'll go for advise by professionals, but which kind of professional would be more suited for this? An MBA or a lawyer? <em>(Obviously, I'll add a lawyer to the mix, but I mean for the financial advise)</em> Or both? Or should look for different professional opinions?</p>

<h1>EDIT:</h1>

<p>I want to thank everybody who answered because you helped me decide a path of action. One of the reasons why I need these contacts is because </p>

<ol>
<li>I've very limited ""people skills"" (low Asperger Syndrome) so I usually need to communicate remotely or by proxy unless I know the person before hand</li>
<li>Dealing with the government in my country means a very high chance of dealing with corruption, something I want to avoid</li>
</ol>

<p>However, based on the answers provided, I already spoke with my lawyer, a financial consultant and a friend who <em>creates and sells</em> startups. They all told me this is crazy, and they offered me to find the investors and contacts for fair shares. They also suggested that, being my project one with really high localization (meaning it can be done in many different cities under different political administrations) I can create micro companies for each local business and then offer stocks to anyone bringing the contacts, which seems very logical to me .</p>

<p>Again, thank you to everybody, I'll choose an answer as correct as per the site's requirements, but they all helped me and I wish I could choose all of them</p>
","<p>As you mentioned you had access to selling a house, do a basic spreadsheet first, and in Cash Flow Spreadsheet,  list the following. </p>

<p>a. The proposed income,  year - on - year over the 10 years, base your income on income via your proposed contacts. </p>

<p>b. In your expenses, put in an expense for Hiring a company or person with ability to reach those contacts</p>

<p>Then when you have allocated the income and expenses, and you have a clearer financial picture of your business model, then you can value your business prior to making a decision.  Should you need help with the spreadsheet, see an accountant.</p>

<p>If you do not have any idea of how to get the contacts you need, you can go back to the angel investor and re negotiate ,  for the same amount of capital, but for a far smaller percentage of the company. </p>

<p>To do your homework on actual realistic income and expenses, is a must, then take it to an accountant for an overview, then re-assess . Please be accurate with the expense of finishing the project, or as accurate as you can. You mentioned that the project is 60% finished, but you have not indicated the realistic cost, so put that cost into your cash flow. </p>

<p>If you can manage to self- fund both the start of your business, and the acquisition of the contacts, then go down that path and your scale - up plans, will be achieved much quicker.    </p>

<p>Larger amounts of money may be necessary as you scale up. </p>

<p>One final point is that if you can fund the last 40% of the project yourself, perhaps you can re-negotiate with the investor on a ""investor supplies the contacts "" basis, and specify exactly what the role of the investor might be, with regard to the contacts. for example, will the investor use the contacts to generate income himself, for the company, therefore guaranteeing an income stream?  and if so , ask him to specify how that would be done, with how many employees , what expenses the investor might pay,  or expenses dealing with the contacts, by the investor, and what expenses your company might pay.   </p>

<p>Should you feel uncomfortable with the particular investor, then seek further investment  by other means, for example contacting Chartered Accountants for advice, they can occasionally provide investors for you, depending on their clientelle.</p>

<p>You have not detailed the use of the $100,000 Capital from the investor , so the suggestions outlined I have based on the information provided.  Hope that helps. </p>

<p>Negotiate this as needed. Keep a long view: sometimes, a bundle allows to sell a lot more of a product for less and you still end up earning more. Make sure you keep your costs in check when you do - the last thing you want is to get bogged down in support while earning peanuts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there anything I should be aware of when dealing with a partner like that which handles sales and marketing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes: don't put all of your eggs in a single basket.</p>

<p>An exclusive reseller deal is only fine for a specific geographical area and only provided they're doing their job. Make sure your deal includes a clause whereby your exclusive relationship no longer stands if they underperform. Take steps in advance to ensure you have plan B (and a plan C) on your radar. Rinse and repeat for other geographical areas.</p>

<p>The same deal is usually not OK for online sales. In that case you either want as many resellers as possible or you want affiliates who steer leads into your direct sales funnel. Be wary of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_stuffing"">affiliate fraudsters</a> if you opt for the latter approach - they're not common in B2B markets but they exist.</p>

They have customers that could potentially like to use my app so they want to suggest my app to those customers and if those customers end up signing up the company obviously wants to get some part of my earnings from those customers.</p>

<p>How much should that be ? i.e. For every 20$ I make a month from a customer, how much of that should go to the company that suggested my app to that customer ?</p>

<p>I'm really bad at this as I've never done anything similar before so any percentage I give will be basically random. I am a tech guy and quite bad at finances I guess... It's definitely not going to be 50% but should it be 5% ? 10% ? 20% ?</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the company in question will <em>not</em> be looking for customers for my app, i.e. they won't be spending time for my app. They get customer for other projects and they're simply thinking of suggesting my app as something extra just in case they and I can make some extra cash out of it.</p>
","<p>Let me make things a little bit easier to you: <strong>You're looking for a finder's fee</strong>.</p>

<p>See, a finder's fee is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A commission paid to an intermediary or the facilitator of a
  transaction. The finder's fee is rewarded because the intermediary
  discovered the deal and brought it forth to interested parties.
  Depending on the circumstance, the finder's fee can be paid by either
  the transaction's buyer or seller.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did I figure it out? When you said <em>""the company in question will not be looking for customers for my app, i.e. they won't be spending time for my app.""</em></p>

<p>So they're not entering as Business Partners (helping in the development, etc) neither as Sales Partners (actively looking for new customers), so your relationship with them will be based only on a finder's fee agreement.</p>

<p>Do you want a finder's fee agreement template? <a href=""https://www.pandadoc.com/finders-fee-agreement-template"" rel=""nofollow"">Here it is :)</a></p>

<p>I really think you should use it, no matter how good your relationship is with your current employer. You know the old saying, <em>friends friends, business apart!</em></p>

<p><strong>Other things than money</strong></p>

<p>Now, before we discuss the numbers, let's get back a little bit: You said that the company will <strong>obviously</strong> wants to get some part of the earning. Well, that's a strong word. </p>

<p>Are you 100% sure of that? Did anyone explicit mentioned that to you? </p>

<p>Of course everyone likes money and I understand your thinking here, <em>why in heaven would someone care to indicate my product for other reason than money?</em> </p>

<p>Well, believe me, it could be for SEVERAL other reasons. So before bringing the finder's fee option to the table, just ask what they are expecting from this partnership.. you may be surprise :)</p>

<p>Now the part everyone is looking for: <strong>How much should you pay</strong>.</p>

<p>Short answer: <strong>5%</strong></p>

<p>For how long? Not for ever I must say (never sign eternum clauses!!).</p>

<p>I should talk about CLV - Customer Lifetime Value but it would make the answer too long so I'll just give you another (very commom for SaaS business) number: <strong>5 years at maximum</strong> - or, of course, as long as you have that customer. </p>

"Causes for options pkg strike price drop","156","","<p>I recently signed on with a startup who offered salary and an options package, along the lines of <code>""40,000 options** valued at $50k today...""</code>.</p>

<p>My exercise (strike) price per share was around $1.25 before. </p>

<p>Today we were notified we're benefitting from a decreased strike price to $0.30 (Exercise price per share), with not much other context. </p>

<p>I don't understand enough about options to evaluate this, other than the fact that a cheaper strike price sounds good to me. What would cause a strike price to drop? I'm assuming a reevaluation of the market value of the company (for better or worse). I opted for more equity than salary so this means a lot to me.</p>

<p>Note: My package is standard 4-year vesting w/ 1 yr cliff, so I'm not even a 1/4 vested yet.</p>
","<p>The <strong>strike price</strong> (or exercise price) for an employee stock option is the price at which an employee can choose to purchase a specified amount of company shares.  The lower the strike price is from the market price, the greater the profit for the employee.  The higher the strike price is from the market price, the greater the loss for the employee.</p>

<p>When an ESO is granted, the strike price cannot be changed.  In order to ""change"" the strike price, the previous ESO is canceled and a new contract is written.  A company cannot lawfully raise the strike price of an ESO without employee consent, excepting a reverse split, a financial maneuver that reduces the volume of outstanding shares by some multiple, and raises the price accordingly; reverse-splits are often executed in order to reach a minimum value for an IPO.  In these cases, the strike price would increase by the multiple of the reverse split (a 3 to 1 split would alter a strike price of $20 to $60).</p>

<p>A company can lawfully <em>lower</em> the strike price without employee consent because a lower strike price is always in the interest of the employee.  This practice is seen unfavorably by investors, who are unable to renegotiate their buying price.</p>

<p>Companies often lower strike prices if the market price falls considerably because employees would not buy-in on their options if they are above the market price.  In these times of market volatility, a company likely will exchange the initial strike price for the new, lower, market price to keep employee options above water.</p>

<p>While I don't know the specifics of the situation, and there might be some circumstance I'm not accounting for, my speculation would be that the market value of your company (or the value of the company's last round of funding) was around $0.30 a share and so they adjusted their ESOs accordingly.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"How do I convince people to use my product without bashing my competition?","156","","<p>I'm launching an open source programming framework that is competing with another open source framework. I'm aiming to make money off support amount other things if the product becomes popular. However, there's a current competitor in the market that's <em>huge</em>. My idea is a much more robust solution that targets developers who should use a more advanced platform (that's not there) but they are stuck using this software. However, looking through the source code, it's apparent that the code is written poorly and it could be done better.</p>

<p>I'm perhaps a little bitter since I've ran into issues when using their framework that shouldn't happen. It's not that bad for most cases, but some parts are poorly maintained.</p>

<p>So, how do I try to promote my product? I don't want to directly bash the other project since that'll make my company look bad. At the same time, it could be used as great opportunity to allow me to win over customers. What do I do to make it not seem like I'm bashing the other product?</p>
","<p>This is always a tough one, to the point that it's probably one of the few issues that a piece of open source software can readily share with someone running for a political office.</p>

<p>Before I get started, I'll note that this question kind of reminds me of <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/q/1362/59"">Tasteful way to say our company emphasizes good works, recycling, etc?</a>. They're not the same thing by any stretch, but I think the central conceit of ""how can I give facts without making my company look bad"" is common and each can take some lessons from the other.</p>

<h1>Focus on the good</h1>

<p>Ultimately, though, I'm not sure that there's really any awesome solution to this. The best approach is probably to focus on the good things.</p>

<p>In other words, when you could say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their product doesn't support this feature!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It might be better to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our product <em>does</em> support this feature!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, you really have to be aware of the audience to make that kind of decision. If people are actively looking for this feature and know that the competitor doesn't have it, this is fine. Of course, if it's one of those nice little things that they might otherwise assume the other product to have, this doesn't really work.</p>

<p>A nice alternative in the latter case is to use a product comparison chart. Using a graphic to illustrate differences can make you seem more objective than writing in in paragraph-form, even if what you're saying is comparable in meaning. When you sound objective, people (probably) won't blame you for being, frankly, better.</p>

<h1>Phrase positively</h1>

<p>Along a similar--albeit arguably more obscure--line, phrasing things positively rather than negatively can reduce the impact of bashing.</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theirs is <em>x</em>% slower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ours is <em>y</em>% faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though they mean the same thing, people are more likely to walk away from the second thinking positively of you. You're saying something nice (fast! good!), and improving your image, without being immediately detrimental to theirs, however strongly it is implied.</p>

<h1>Get recommendations</h1>

<p>Recommendations are another great way of marketing things like this. If you can get testimonials from users of your product, you can essentially use their word in place of yours. Within reason, if they say ""this product is so much better than <em>[competitor's]</em>,"" your company isn't really at fault for that.</p>

<p>Of course, you still have to be careful. If you have twenty testimonials talking about how awful that other project is, people will catch onto the point you're trying to make.</p>

<h1>Don't go overboard</h1>

<p>Whatever approach you take, don't focus everything you do on sounding better than your competition. Have a section in your documentation, sure, but you don't need to spend all of your marketing area talking about how much better you are than your competition. If you make yourself sound awesome, then mention, ""oh, and we also have this going for us over our competitor,"" that'll sound a lot more factual, and have an overall more positive effect. Presumably, your project can stand on its own two feet, and the advantages over your competition are merely side-effects.</p>

"What do I need to start a consulting service?","156","","<p>I'm a full time employee but I want to slowly start to making money by my own, until the day I can quit the job and work full-time for myself. I've wondered about a few options and I think the most obvious is to start a consulting service.</p>

<p>Although I know the primary role of a consultant is to provide solutions I don't know much more than that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are the clients? How to first attract them?</li>
<li>What kind of questions am I expected to be asked?</li>
<li>Is it feasible to have a consulting service as my second job when I have a full time job (44h/week)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I need a north on the subject, so the answers for each bullet can for sure be superficial. As I have more knowledge I will be able to ask more elaborated questions. The questions in the bullets are there to make the question not broad, as my main question is ""What do I need to start a consulting service?""</p>

<p>I'm a Brazilian Java developer, but I believe that programming language and localization can be disregarded for this question.</p>

<p>The legal questions can be put aside, as it has been very well answered on other two questions.</p>
","<p>In general, what you need is a clear plan of what your added value is (as a Java developer) to your customers, and what kind of customers are most likely to need your services. Can you formulate a 30 second pitch for yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Do you recognise the situation where [...]? If so, I can help you
  by [...]""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also figure out what you want to be paid, if you want to take on fixed-price projects, how you want to handle overage costs on projects, and what buffers you have in case you can't find projects for a while.</p>

<p>To answer your specific questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Who are the clients? How to first attract them?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>You would generally contact other people in the same business and build a network. Go to meetups on you area of expertise in your area, or contribute to events or open source projects. Make yourself known, and slowly you'll start getting noticed by potential customers. This might take a while though!</p>

<p>Another option is to actively engage potential customers by phone, email, or social media. Again, make a short email or introduction and offer to buy them coffee or lunch, assuming that in Brazil that's a common practise in business.</p>

<p>You could also advertise your services on websites specifically for finding freelancers like: <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2013/01/16/freelance-jobs/"">http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2013/01/16/freelance-jobs/</a></p>

<ol>
<li><em>What kind of questions am I expected to be asked?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>How can you help me? What kind of references do you have? What happens if you get sick? Will you be able to make the deadlines I've set? How will you ensure that? Are you willing to invest time upfront to make a proposal or prototype? Are you willing to commit to a fixed price proposal? Will you be available to support the project / product for the next few years?</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Is it feasible to have a consulting service as my second job when I have a full time job (44h/week)?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>This really depends on your situation, but I would say no, unless you are able to set your own hours for the consulting business. As a developer, assume that your customers might want you on site during business hours, which would require an arrangement with your current employer.</p>

<p>Be aware that this might not be an easy step to take, but it can be very beneficial if you can get a steady stream of projects.</p>

"What is the average salary for founding members when starting a startup?","156","","<p>What is an average salary for a founding member of a startup? I realise many don't take any salary at all the first few months, but those who do?</p>

<p>Clarification:
I'm swedish, so I mostly care about startup salaries in Sweden or EU, but US ones will still help. Also, I'm thinking about starting companies in the area of SaaS, apps or similar.</p>
","<p>In the US, as a founder you don't take any salary until the seed round. This is the ""sweat equity"" that is part of being a founder. Once you get a seed round, you usually take a small salary to help pay the bills but that is typically it. And all the founders generally get the same small amount. But once you get Series A funding you can start to expect to be paid a real salary commensurate with your role, experience, location etc.  Hard to give exact numbers because it can be quite different by role and location.</p>

"Are There Any Advantages To Setting Up A Unique Component Of A Business As A Separate Entity","155","","<p>There is a unique component (business process) in the business I'm designing. It could be that the business does a pivot at some time to focus exclusively on that component. That's not my intention, but it's an obvious possibility.</p>

<p>My question is if there would be any advantages of setting that component up as its own entity from the beginning? I intend to focus on the main business, but I wonder if this could provide some flexibility to provide a separate income stream if necessary. And if I did have to pivot, it might be easier to do with the separate entity already in place.</p>
","<p>An old school answer would center around the issue of ownership.  Creating a seperate company to own a particular business process and then having that company license its process to your main business venture, establishes that the new company's current stock holders hold complete control of that process, no matter how much the ownership of the main business venture gets diluted by investors, sweat-equity inititives and buy outs.  If a busiess practice is general enough to apply across multiple industries and/or projects, not seperating its ownership means that all of its future applications will have to be owned by or licensed from, your current business entity.</p>

<p>In terms of the new school concepts of agility, fail-fast and pivoting with your market, I don't see that the ownership arrangement would have any effect.</p>

<p>Also note that creating seperate companies to own each business process is an significant ongoing expense, not only because of recurring fees but also because of the tax ramifications of such decision.

"Why does a startup need financing?","155","","<p>This is my first question - a very trivial one I think. Recently, I was reading up a bit on startups. I'd be glad if someone could clarify the main purpose of investing in a startup i.e. what does the VC money, seed investing money actually help the startup with?</p>

<p><strong>From Marc Andreessen's blog:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ll notice that a lot of what you may need to do is kick the ball
  further down the road — make more progress against your plan before
  you raise venture capital. This obviously raises the issue of how
  you’re supposed to do that before you’ve raised money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it that a startup cannot make progress without any venture capital? Is it because the founders who are working on the product will not get paid otherwise? Are there any other reasons? </p>

<p>Also, I'd really appreciate it if someone could link me to a website that has a lot of startup and business info!</p>
","<p>Meh, this is a quote from Marc Andreessen <em>who is running a VC firm</em>. Would you seriously expect him to tell you that he should <em>not</em> get a piece from your cake? :-)</p>

<p>(Quick life tip in passing: learn about who is saying what you're reading and what's in it for them; especially when it sounds weird or counter-intuitive.)</p>

<p>On a more serious note, raise money if you tick most of these boxes:</p>

<ul>
<li>you do not want to run a so-called ""lifestyle business"" that is good enough</li>
<li>you need massive scale to make it work</li>
<li>you're broke and can't bootstrap even if you wanted to (but if so, get a business co-founder)</li>
<li>you don't mind the overhead of reporting to a VC</li>
<li>you'd like a VC to introduce you to their network of contacts (it's overrated if you've a competent sales around)</li>
<li>you're willing to bet the house that growing fast with a much higher risk of failing is more interesting to you than growing slowly</li>
<li>working 10+h/day is your thing (<a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?language=en"">it probably shouldn't</a>, but it's your life choice.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The key thing to keep in mind is that the VC will be looking at their ROI. If you bootstrap, the only thing that counts is break even and making a larger profit from that point forward - however slow or fast. If you're VC-funded, there's a rather strong pressure to spend the money you've raised in order to create a business that is larger than you may want it to be, faster than you want to get there, because your investors are in it for the ROI. It's a hard problem because it's a recipe to build <a href=""https://steveblank.com/2015/05/19/organizational-debt-is-like-technical-debt-but-worse/"">organizational debt</a>.

","<p>Depending on your budget, you have a couple of outsourcing options, and all your tasks can be catered for with these companies listed below. If you don't like any of these, then Google 'Virtual Assistant' or 'Virtual Assistant India' for other options - there are loads out there!</p>

<p><a href=""http://web.timeetc.co.uk/powerful/"" rel=""nofollow"">Time Etc</a> is a UK based, UK sourced company so the prices are a little on the expensive side at £26 an hour. Unlike the other companies on this list, I think they only charge hourly which means they could take two hours to complete a one hour task and you'll be £52 out of pocket instead of £26.</p>

<p>If you're looking for something a little cheaper, then I'd recommend outsourcing your work to somewhere like India. I haven't used all of these myself so can't recommend one over the other, but there are benefits and drawbacks to each so they're worth having a look at and see which one suits you and your business most.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.taskseveryday.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tasks Everyday</a> - starts at around £5 an hour (or $7 USD) and allows you to increase or decrease your team size with minimal notice. They also cater for different industries such as bookkeeping, accounts, web design or just normal virtual assistants. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.yourdailytasks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Your Daily Tasks</a> - I've used this company before (but sadly, am not getting any commission for this mention!), it allows you to pay either on an hourly basis or a project basis. It's harder to get a quote for the latter because, you guessed it, it depends on the task size... but it shouldn't take very long to get a quote for the type of tasks you're after.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brickworkindia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Brickwork India</a>  - this company was recommended in Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Work Week but I haven't used them myself (they were in huge demand after the book was released and I felt like they were struggling with the workload, that's just my opinion though). They operate in a similar way to YDT and you can set up either an hourly or task-based plan with them.</p>

<p>So yeah, it's worth shopping around and getting a best price for the work you've got lined up. I'd always suggest going for a task-based rather than an hourly rate (and that applies to life in general... like if you're getting your windows replaced or getting your bathroom redone)</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Recently we with team come up to the following list of names:</p>

<ol>
<li>LigrAd</li>
<li>AdStore</li>
<li>AdView</li>
<li>AdOn</li>
</ol>

<p>Please help to choose.</p>
","<p>As far as I can think of this has no negative associations. To me it sounds fine. The only sort-of conflict that I can think of is the Chinese name Li Grad but I think that is a minor conflict and unlikely to cause any problems.</p>

<p>It is a <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/212/44"">fantasy name</a> which does have drawbacks and benefits. However since you are dealing with advertisements you have removed most of the drawbacks (most specifically not being immediately apparent what you do since anything ending in ad is at least marginally apparent that it may refer to advertising). You definitely have the benefits - easy remembrance, uniqueness. So I would say it is a good choice.   </p>

<p>In regards to the issue brought up by Sepano - possible differences in pronunciation - I do not think that that is problematic. Many companies names are not always 100% guessable as to how to pronounce unless you know what language they are based on and are familiar with the grammar of that language - like for example <a href=""http://www.watchtime.com/reference-center/watch-brand-pronunciation-guide/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this list exists</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT (Re: updated with list of names): </p>

<ul>
<li>LigrAd; covered above it is <em>my favourite due to it's uniqueness</em>.</li>
<li>AdStore: That could easily conflict with <a href=""http://www.adstore.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Ad Store</a> - yes that has spaces but way too similar which will at minimum give you a much harder time with SEO.</li>
<li>AdView: Google's Android has a backend coding type (for banner ads) named AdView - so I don't like this one either.</li>
<li>AdOn: I (and probably a lot of other people) will see this and think it is a miss-spelled add-on as in a plugin or extension for <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Firefox/Thunderbird/Seamonkey</a> or a lot of other projects too.</li>

<p>Which one will sound better in a VC's ear ? And look better on my pitch deck's mini resume ?</p>

<p>Thanks !</p>
","<p>I personally do not think MBAs provide you with much educational benefits, but it having an MBA will provide you with 2 key items - a helpful alumni network and a higher base salary.</p>

<p>The level of work you do is what matters to a VC.  If you are doing more lower level work at 500 startups now, then that will not be as impressive as getting an MBA and having a unique internship on your resume so you can apply for a more senior role later.  If you are able to land a great job now that will be great on your resume, than do that instead of the MBA.  Think of the MBA as a launching pad if you are not happy with the jobs you can get right now.</p>

Is this a poor strategy for building a scalable company? </p>

<p>The data is available from more than one business source and then our service manipulates the data into something more meaningful.</p>
","<p>This is the subject for some debate in many startup and investment circles.</p>

<p>One school of thought is that it is extremely risky, and that there are many examples of companies that have been decimated, ruined, when the ""data-source"" company decides to cut off access, change APIS, or start charging for the data access. There is a graveyard somewhere with tombstones of company names that have been inadvertently (or deliberately) killed off by facebook and twitter when they throttled data access, limited apis ... or cut-off access because they released a competing product.</p>

<p>The other school of thought is that there is a huge business for those who use data aggregation and APIs from 3rd parties - and do it right. Usually this means adding lots of extra value to the consumer. This comes by consolidating data from many sources, summarizing, interpreting, customizing or creating tools that allow users to better use the raw data. Again, there are a plethora of companies who do very well in creating twitter tools (or overall social media tools) that rely on twitter/FB data streams and APIs.</p>

"Steps to register a business name","150","","<p>I am programming a game that I am hoping to turn a profit on. To achieve this I have come to the conclusion that I will need a business. I live in the state of Michigan, U.S.A. What process would I have to go through to claim ownership over a company name? How much does it cost?</p>
","<p>There's a great site I found a year or so ago that provides steps for every state as well as filing fees, mandatory annual actions, and other things.</p>

<p>Specifically for Michigan: <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/michigan-form-llc-31760.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/michigan-form-llc-31760.html</a></p>

<p>I quoted the major parts here but please visit their site as it has all the information. I've read through this specific state's info previously (as it's where I live) and I plan on following this same process myself in a few months.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Choose a Name for Your LLC:
  Under Michigan law, an LLC name must contain the words ""Limited Liability Company"" or the abbreviations ""L.L.C."" or ""LLC.""
  Your LLC’s name must be distinguishable from the names of other business entities already on file with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. ...</li>
  <li>File Articles of Organization:
  A Michigan LLC is created by filing Articles of Organization with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Bureau of Commercial Services. ... The filing fee is $50.</li>
  <li>Appoint a Registered Agent:
  Every Michigan LLC must have an agent for service of process in the state. ... The registered agent must have a physical street address in Michigan.</li>
  <li>Prepare an Operating Agreement:
  An LLC operating agreement is not required in Michigan, but is highly advisable. ...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>Comply With Other Tax and Regulatory Requirements ...</li>
  <li>File Annual Statements:
  All LLCs doing business in Michigan must file an annual statement with the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. ... The filing fee is $25.</li>
  <li>...</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So in total, 75$ in filling fees and 25$ annually.</p>

<p>You will also need some address that can be served legal papers in case you are sued and you must be comfortable with it being public knowledge as anyone can then find it when searching for your business listing on Michigan's website. It has to be a physical location (like a house or office, not a postal box) but I've seen some that aren't so I assume that's technically not legal.</p>

<p>Also, as Cromian said, a Trademark would help in protecting your company name from other people who would like to use it.</p>

<p>But remember, I am not a lawyer. Plenty of people do this stuff but if you're ever unsure about something major, you should contact a lawyer.</p>

"As a developer how do I find start ups to work with?","149","","<p>I'm a developer with years of experience, but I also have a good MA design education and business knowledge. How do I find a start up project to work on  as I'm keen to use as much as the full gamut of my skills as possible and I think the start up environment is one place where that might happen.</p>
","<p>It depends on whether you want to join as a founder or as an employee. </p>

<p>If you want to join as a founder (no salary until you get funding, and usually a low salary afterward) it's not hard to find startups who are looking for a developer, but its hard to find a good one. The most important thing is really great people, and because it's hard to know that unless you really know them, the best way is to look through your social connections. If you can't find a good team that way, you might want to try to join a team whom already built startups is the past. </p>

<p>If you want to join as an employee its basicly the same, but you have the privilege of getting paid better and choosing between the relatively successful startups that were able to raise capital funding. </p>

<p>I would say that in such case, the product and vision of the startup are also very important because you don't get to design it from the start. You want to do something that you are really passionate about and most startups want employees who are really passionate about what they do. A good way to search for such startups is just to look at crunchbase.com for companies you find intresting in your area and approach them. Most startups are eager for talented developers.</p>

"Copyrighting a Product before registering your company","148","","<p>A friend and I are currently working on a Board Game, we have an initial Draft of the Rulebook and all the Templates/Counters that the player will need, and we would like to Copyright our Products (chiefly the Book) to stop people infringing on our Idea.</p>

<p>Currently we have not registered ourselves as a Company, so is it possible for us to Copyright our product in both of our names, then transfer the Copyright to the Company if/when we make it?</p>

<p>My real question I suppose is, do we need to register the company, or the copyright first?</p>
","<p>You do not need to <em>register</em> copyright. Copyright basically <em>is</em> -- from the moment you create something, you own the copyright, no registration need.</p>

<p>What you can do is <em>protect</em> the copyright, register a trademark, or file an over-priced design patent. But most of that is pointless for the most part besides the trademark itself -- and even that is borderline pointless for a small gig until you can afford it.</p>

<p>Protecting copyright is as simple as being able to offer proof that yours was first. Print it and snail mail the copy to yourself. Keep it unopened. Done. You can then show that you've prior art and that is basically all you need to protect it.</p>

<p>Protecting a trademark requires active involvement and defense. If you repeatedly let others use your trademark, you basically lose your rights to it. And that is why Google will go after any domain with Google or AdWord in it. Prepare to go to court over it.</p>

<p>For the rest, and as blunders already highlighted, you cannot copyright an idea -- just the implementation. You can actually <em>patent</em> an idea but it's <em>super</em> pricey, and you need to show there is no prior art among other things -- if memory serves, patenting an idea in the US involves putting forward two original ways to implement it. If you consider it, think $10k+ worth of $500+/hour attorney fees and ask yourself if you'd be willing to put the money forward to actively defend it in court. (Think of Apple's infamous rounded corners design patent. They could. Could you?)</p>

<p>Bottom line, register your company, and per your other question focus on building a community that wants to buy either <em>your</em> implementation or value-added products around it. And don't fuss too much over IP -- boardgamers hate it anyways.</p>

<p>Think D&amp;D if you will, and analyze all that went wrong with it: they ""open-sourced"" one edition if I got it right (I stopped playing it when it was still called AD&amp;D), and then went on to produce boat loads of crap in follow-up editions, while they shut down everything of value around it (namely Dungeon Magazine, which provided top-notch scenarios) instead of turning the latter into the focal point of their marketing.</p>

<p>Or Games Workshop for that matter. They've the crown for producing over priced miniatures, and they're despised by even old-time players for doing so, but they sell crap tons of the stuff.</p>

"How do you deal with flaking project partners working on a potential start-up project?","148","","<p>I've come across the situation where a group of friends and acquaintances get together to build a prototype of a project. This is far prior to incorporating a company or drafting a founders' agreement so we're not even close to formulating any contracts for at least 9 months. </p>

<p>However after getting ~70% done, some of the project partners disappear due to lack of desire to continue working so hard or become too ""busy"" to continue. I know it's probably no use trying to convince people who aren't motivated anymore. </p>

<ol>
<li>Since they've contributed towards development of the prototype, could they come back and ask for equity later if the project becomes successful?</li>
<li>Would the best thing to do be to formally part ways?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Tom's answer gives you the why. I'll go into some of the how.</p>

<p>You are <strong>not</strong> 9 months away from written agreements, you are 60% of a prototype <strong>too late</strong>. Rectify it immediately.</p>

<p>If they are friends (and acquaintances) who are still friendly, you can try the friendly negotiation. Phrase it like ""Hey, some of us want to keep working on this, but it seems like it isn't a good fit for you. Let's clarify everyone's commitment and contribution to date.""</p>

<p>The prototype is 70% complete so you need to get some certainty. Buy out the flakers at the same time and on similar terms as the remaining developers get on board. Look on startups.SE for guidelines/ideas on how to structure these early pre-prototype agreements.</p>

<p>How to buy out the flakers.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If they have't done anything: </p>

<ul>
<li>literally they were there for the first meeting, said ""yes"" and then
did nothing. </li>
<li>$1 or something small but valuable (aka a peppercorn)</li>
<li>at the very least use a quit claim deed (if you are in a common law country).</li>
<li>If the early or kickoff meetings scoped a product, then value the time and effort as a contribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If they have put effort in, </p>

<ul>
<li>work out what that effort is in hours </li>
<li>be generous in this calculation -- if there were 50 hours of wasted UX trials it was still 50 hours to learn what didn't work</li>
<li>value that contribution in market rates </li>
<li>e.g. 150 hours of industrial design @ $75 per hour = $12,500</li>
<li>buy them out with a contract containing $1 and an IOU of $12,500. Include a quit claim deed (if you are in a common law country).</li>
<li>the ""business"" should buy them out. Not the individual continuing developers or (shudder!) continuing developers in a partnership.</li>
<li>continuing developers should also have an IOU from the ""business"" on similar terms for services rendered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>IOU provisions are totally negotiable but be smart</p>

<ul>
<li>this is not legal advice just stuff to wrap your head around.</li>
<li>payable once the ""business"" is a ""success"" or ""launches"" as defined by...</li>
<li>like the ""business"" creates a product within x years that generates Y revenue?</li>
<li>what happens if any developers jointly or severally leave/fork the project before ""success"" and then that fork goes on to be a ""success""?</li>
<li>this is the case when the phrase ""or it's successors or assigns"" comes up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If some of the flakers have totally flaked and are unresponsive so you can't negotiate to buy them out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Get some legal advice</li>
<li>consider sending a written offer that if they fail to respond in x days (a long time like at least 90 days!), they will be considered to have abandoned the project and any rights to it.</li>
<li>You'll probably have to do something like this several times and keep records to prove you attempted to negotiate with them in good faith.</li>
<li>You should probably vest their contribution just like everyone else's.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>New thought added to this edited answer</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>Partnerships </li>
</ol>

<p>In common law countries the development of a prototype in this manner possibly means you have all entered into a partnership at the very least <em>for the development of the prototype</em>.</p>

<p>Ad hoc partnerships are <strong>always</strong> bad from a risk assessment perspective. Because they have little upside and a whole lot of downside risk.</p>

<p>That is the main reason to document the intent of the developers early on.</p>

<p>As a minimum exchange emails that say something like...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's develop a prototype of this thing and see if it is works. </p>
  
  <p>If anything comes of this prototype we will work out what to do next.
  In that case we'll split the business equally between the 8 of us = 
  12.5% each (or split it based on time involved).</p>

"Starting a programming school: How much to charge","148","","<p>My cousin is a school teacher on Vancouver Island, Canada. She wants to start a school to teach local kids (perhaps eventually adults as well; I don't have all the details) how to program. She's just getting started, but seems to have the basic structure in place, including instructors, course layout, a schedule... She's got some open questions, though, such as how much should she charge? The answers aren't easy, since her target audience, at least for now, is grade-school children (grades 1-7); convincing the parents to shell out their hard-earned cash in the face of all the other after-school programs is a bit of a challenge, so a marketable argument for the value proposition is key.</p>

<p>Here's what their website says about the curriculum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will focus on two programming languages, Scratch and Javascript.
  The descriptions below provide highlights of what students will learn
  in these 8-week courses.</p>
  
  <p>Classes are teacher led, with 1-2 objectives for each class. Because
  students learn at their own speed, some may not achieve all the class
  objectives during class time. They will have the option to take the
  assignment home to work on it between classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>Before you decide on a price, you should give some thought to weather or not you need to charge only one price. It can be possible to charge different groups different amounts, the price charged for each group will differ and be based on what that group is willing to pay. </p>

<p>This is more common than you might think, senior citizen discounts, for example, are a way of charging one group (senior citizen) less than another group (everyone else). Such pricing isn't all altruistic. Such practices allow you to lower the price for a group of customers (senor citizens) that otherwise wouldn't buy as much of your product because the price is too high, without lowering the price for everyone (which would reduce your profits). In your case you may want to charge different prices for different grades say one price for grades(1-4) and another for grades(5-7). (ask in the comments if you want more discussion about this). </p>

<p>Regardless of how many different prices you charge you should set each price based on that groups demand for the product. </p>

<p>Demand is the relationship between a set of prices and the amount the group buy when charged that price. When price goes up, demand does not go down! The amount the group buys goes down, but that is different than the demand going down, when demand goes down the group will buy less, even if the price hasn't changed. (note it's not true that as price goes up the group will buy less for all goods, but for most goods this is true, and in your case it is safe to assume that as you charge more, the groups will buy less). </p>

<p>So in some cases you can make more profit by lowering your price because a lot more people start buying your product, and this more than offsets the loss in revenue caused by reducing the price. And in other case you can make more profit by raising your price because the increase in sales revenue is not offset by the losses caused by the decrease in the number of items sold. </p>

<p>You also need to keep in mind that price signals quality. If you see a product with a cheap price you assume it is of low quality. </p>

<p>Finally you need to consider cost. When you consider cost, make sure to consider all the explicit and not explicit costs. That is to say make sure that you are are being compensated for you time, and efforts. Price should not be some multiple of your costs, or cost plus margin. Costs set a bar that you should not go bellow. As long as you are making more money per student than it costs to teach a student you are good and you don't have to consider cost in your pricing scheme. Technically you should be considering the marginal cost per student, but in your case this will be difficult to calculate because most of your per student costs will not be explicit, they will abstract like how adding an extra student will effect the student teacher ratio, and the class dynamic. </p>

<p>OK enough economics mombo jumgo, what does all that mean? </p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you are making more than you are spending to teach the class, plus enough to compensate you for your time and the wage that you would otherwise be making. </li>
<li>Try and determine if you can divide your potential buyers into groups that you would be able to charge different prices &amp; would be willing to pay different prices. </li>
<li>Look at similar goods (ie after school activities) that these consumers (student's parents) are purchasing and figure out how much they are charging and how many students they are attracting and use this to estimate these groups demand (aka willingness to pay for these goods) </li>
<li>Start with a High price because this signals that your class is of high quality, and if you can't attract enough students lower your price to attract more students, but be prepared to provide partial refunds to your existing clients. </li>
<li>You can also set a high regular price, coupled with tiered early bird prices (ie the first x students to sign up pay y, the next x students pay z, etc). This has the advantage of avoiding signalling that your course is of low quality (because of the high ""regular price), while motivating people to purchase now, and allows you the option of extending anyone early bird special if you notice that sales are decreasing more than you'd like) with out giving the impression that you are jacking up the price. </li>

<p>What factors go into this?</p>
","<p>I can think of multiple reasons and others could apply...</p>

<p>Sometimes the person who says nothing at the dinner table speaks loudest and if you are a company that has just won an investment, sometimes you can say everything by saying nothing because you have peeked peoples curiosity. </p>

<p>As an old manager friend of mine once asked when I made a suggestion: ""Who would benefit from the information?"".  If the company would benefit, it will be shouted from the tree tops. If the benefits are less clear, then specific details are not necessary, other than announcing that someone somewhere figured they were worth something. When you are specific, you set expectations and sometimes you do not want to do that.</p>

<p>Investment can also be a kin to salary. Some love to boast, some prefer to be more discreet.  Some folk will say their salary is x but not include the fact they get health insurance, travel insurance and a company car. Others will say their salary includes the extras. Others will just say it is a good/bad/generous/acceptable salary and not quote you figures. The same reasons roughly apply - sometimes it is advantageous to promote oneself and say you are earning vast amounts of money - other times its safer not to attract the wrong sort of attention by being boastful.</p>

<p>Also - an investment could be bundled with conditions. Valuing a company a billion bucks might not include a cash investment - it might for example include services given for 'free' for a period of time. </p>

<p>Example: I recall a well known US telecom group who made a foray into the UK internet market in the late 1990s. I worked for a large well known US computer services company based in London and they made a multi million dollar investment in the UK project. The investment was an exchange of hardware and services - no cash and in exchange, the computer services company got X% of the UK telecom company. How do you value this investment? Do you use the list price of the hardware and software services?</p>

<p>Then there is the possibility to agree that investor X pays 100million bucks into company Y. The investment will be worth 10% of company Y if sales targets hit 50million within six months. If company Y fails to achieve 50million within six months then investor X gets 15% of company Y.</p>

"Why many popular IT companies are located in United States?","146","","<p>What is a reason that many IT companies are located in USA (especially in Silicon Valley) ?<br />
Is it because of the taxation system in USA, special promotion from government or something else?</p>

<p>I've also noticed that many IT companies move to United States.</p>
","<p>It is not for tax reasons!  The US has a very high tax rate compared to many other countries, or at best about the same tax rate.</p>

<p>There is a lot of programming talent in the US, but is it a combination of many different skill sets that are located in NY/SF including design, marketing, and most importantly close access to funding.</p>

<p>US investors prefer investing within the US due to additional tax burdens investing overseas so having a US based company can raise funds more cheaply and can work closely with investors.  Follow the money and that's where companies will be located which is a big reason why NY is growing its tech scene again.</p>

<li><p>There is no real definition of what they're counting as ""big pivot"" in the article.

"How to overcome the technical gap that 'Ideas Persons' interested in starting their own business might have?","145","","<p>As the title suggests I happen to be what some would consider an ideas person. While this is great for generating and developing concepts - that does not necessarily make me or persons like me capable of individually bringing such ideas to fruition (functional product or service), much less start up a business around it.</p>

<p>The issue most troubling to me is that I lack the technical expertise: </p>

<ul>
<li>to determine with conviction that a given idea will function as planned*, or</li>
<li>to actually execute the idea even if I am fairly sure that it will function as planned</li>
</ul>

","<p>As myself being a technical person, I will describe from my stand point what you need. </p>

<p>When clients approach to me with ideas, there are usually two steps involved. </p>

<p>Step 1. Determine if the idea is feasible. You need quality expert for this. If you have to pay for it, do so. If you manage to find guys who can do feasibility and implementation at the same time, then there are high chances that you will get feasibility study for free. But don't expect it be of the same quality and quantity as the paid one. </p>

<p>Step 2. Technical analysis to determine costs and time frame. This is done by experts as well, probably those who will implement the idea. The result will be technical specifications (high and low level) which may consist of multiple documents. If this is done by the implementation team, there are high chances that this will be done for free. If done for free, it may be as complex as paid one and may contain only 1 document. </p>

"If Snapchat IPOed today, would it's valuation fall?","144","","<p>Tech companies are usually valued at 10x revenue. This puts Snapchat at about $5b given a 2016 revenue of 500m.</p>

<p>This is like a third of its current valuation.</p>

<p>Do you think Snapchat would plunge after IPO kind of like Facebook did?</p>
","<p>Nobody can know the answer to your question until it happens.  Otherwise everyone would know whether to buy or short shares once it does IPO.  I know this sounds a bit smart-aleck, but let me explain, if I may.</p>

<p>The <em>theory</em> is that the underwriters of the IPO will price it at a level where it will be well-received by the investing public, but history shows this isn't always the case.</p>

<p>Most of the time it's about perception.  If investors looking at the company's revenue model are convinced that the company is, or soon will be, profitable and the pricing of the shares isn't too greedy then you have a good recipe for a favorable uptick when the stock begins trading.  On the other hand, if nobody really understands how the company will make money in the long-run then it might not do so well, no matter how cheaply it's offered.</p>

<p>The problem with many IPOs is that when they first begin to trade publicly, there are quite a few investors who bought shares or invested early on in the process, and this is their first opportunity to cash out some of their position and recoup their money.  If demand for the stock by the public is light then selling by these ""insiders"" will outstrip buying and the stock will fall until the excess shares are bought up.  On the other hand, if demand is heavy then the stock will rise even in the face of selling by insiders.</p>

<p>As you can see, there's no way to know until trading begins what will really happen.  I hope this gave you <em>some</em> insight, anyway.</p>

"Monetizing for an Armed Security Company","144","","<p>So I've been working a lot on my business model and wonder what are the best options for monetizing it. It's an armed security company.</p>

<p>Traditionally, clients want to pay bottom dollar for security. They only really care about their security when things getting bad or have already occurred. Thus, most companies hire the lowest costs solution for their business and end up with a Barney Fife, who has no real interest towards increasing the safety and security of the organization.</p>

<p>My company wants to deliver a premium product, not a Barney Fife or mall cop. One which is an actual deterrent and reactive towards hazards. What is the best way to monetize that effort with mindset of ""pay as little as you can for security"". The service is pretty much all or nothing. You either have an officer on your primes or not. Events either happen on your property or not. Sometimes its even impossible to classify such events.</p>
","<p>My mentor once went on a CEO level job interview even though his minimum acceptable salary was considerably higher than the job was offering.  At the end of the interview, having marketed his talents effectively, it came time to discuss money.  The employer asked what he was needed to make and as expected was shocked by the honest reply.  The interview was over and no common ground had been found.  As they were parting ways, my mentor offered the card he had been holding until just that moment.</p>

<p>""How about this?  I will work for you for one month at the rate you've offered.  Then, if you don't choose to raise my pay to the level I require, I will quit.  If you can afford to let me go at that time, then I don't deserve what I'm asking.""</p>

<p>For almost a decade following that interview, my mentor ran that company.</p>

<p>A parallel approach in your industry would involve your offering a trial month at a price competitive with the Barney Fife's.  That gives you a month to get your foot in the door and prove to the owners that your service is worth the premium you charge.</p>

<p>-- edit to respond to the OP's comment --</p>

<p>That the advantage of your higher quality service is practically invisible to your potential customer is a major concern.  Although I see your concern with this as a monetization challenge, it may also be seen as a marketing challenge.  </p>

<p>How do you differentiate your company from Barney Fife's Inc.?</p>

<p>The only thing that comes immediately to mind is incident reporting.  I can imagine that a premium rate security company would provide the owner with daily and weekly reports of every security incident, leveraging the higher IQ's of their guards to produce better documentation.</p>

<p>I know that my original answer didn't help you and that I have now strayed quite far from your original question, but I'm out of ideas.  </p>

"Usefulness of Mission and Vision Statements","144","","<p>Certainly, I have never started a business.  As an employee of several companies through my life, I have found Mission and Vision Statements to be lofty, stuffy, and hackneyed.</p>

<p>Is it possible to have any type of business without such statements?  Is there an example of every type of business without these?  (i.e. LLC, Corp., etc.)</p>
","<p>Actually, you're so wrong on your impression that I can't help but give a lengthy answer...</p>

<p>What counts isn't a lofty, stuffy, and hackneyed mission or vision statement. What really counts is a so-called unique selling proposition.</p>

<p>Try this test: visit ten of your competitors' websites and take the tagline and the first paragraph on their landing page or sales letter. Blank our company and product names if needed, and pass this around in your office. Buy a beer to anyone who can recognize who's who in there. You're not taking much risk because, well, they're not so unique in practice.</p>

<p>See where this is heading? What are you communicating on precisely? Using which terms? And how is it different from your competition? As in, how recognizable are you once you weed out the BS marketing speak and break it down to benefits?</p>

<p><em>That</em> is what the so-called lofty, stuffy, and hackneyed mission or vision statement is about. And it's not  lofty, stuffy, or hackneyed.</p>

<p>Compare this tagline from before and after I helped a recent client:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about your media partner's reliability?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It says nothing about what they're doing. After researching what they did, I offered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ad fraudsters will steal over $6 billion this year. We make sure it's not from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They weren't happy with it because it was too close to a competitor's. So I then offered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We help advertisers increase their ROI by revealing the fraudsters that steal from them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it's still a work in progress. A more recent version that we're leaning onto is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We help advertisers optimize their budget by revealing unviewable ads and bot traffic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frankly, it's still not as good -- as in strong -- as I'd like it to be. But we'll get there.</p>

<p>What the above will hopefully suggest is that there's a lot more to it than mission statements or what have you. It went from a vague statement about what they might be about to a to-the-point, understandable by just about anyone statement on what they actually do.</p>

<p>And in the end, you really want to throw in a proper benefit in there, because that makes the difference between contacting you or not.</p>

<p>As to your actual question: yes, it is very possible to have a business <em>without</em> such a statement. In fact, most businesses don't have one and fallback to a pointless slogan. But having a good unique selling proposition and articulating your marketing around it can make the difference between near-nil recognizability and conversion rates of 10% or more.</p>

","<p>The question of going global is a question that needs more information to answer correctly. There are a number of things that you should think about before thinking about ""going global""...</p>

<p>The thing you want to do when launching a startup is learn, everything you do should be done with a specific test in mind. But before you do anything you need to make assumptions that will shape your initial launch plan. The assumptions include...</p>

<p>Who is your target market? This should be as narrow as possible and never something like ""males from 25-50"", something more like ""men between 30-45 who work in the technology sector, live in New York and San Fran and have $100,000+ in income"" or even more narrow.</p>

<p>As you can see from this assumption it helps you guide you plan in many ways. Let's use my example since I know nothing about your product...</p>

<ul>
<li>if you start with men in the tech industry then it makes sense to initially target NY and SF since these are the areas with tech guys and high salaries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you can test this assumption with targeted ads and see how the people in those places and demographics respond. Measure those results and see if your assumptions should be changed.</p>

<p>Bonus: A business plan can be a big waste of time for startups, if you spend weeks or months writing up a business plan then you have wasted weeks or months where you could have launched the product and actually started learning!

<p>Is ""wantrepreneurs"" the best term for this type of entrepreneurs, and more importantly, what separates ""real"" entrepreneurs from wantrepreneurs?</p>
","<p>Wantrepreneurs in my experience are people who attend all the startup meetup, networking, accelerator, hackathon events.

<p>All these plus they still work at a full time job and do not have an idea how they will survive without a car and expensive Apple devices. </p>

"Should I write a ""holiday"" theme for my mobile app?","142","","<p>I have a puzzles game for phones, and I'm wondering whether it's worth it for me to write a holiday skin for it.</p>

<p>I know a lot of other games do this, and I certainly see that it could be fun, but assuming adding any sort of skin will involve at least <em>some</em> design, development, and testing, not to mention sometimes app updates can cause corruption or bugs in edge cases, is it really worth it?</p>

<p>The way I see it, the main (only?) pro is that it keeps a fun and lively vibe to the game. I guess it also shows users that we're paying attention to them. Maybe there's an advantage that users will see the app update and choose to go into it if they've forgotten about it?</p>

<p>I'm also not sure whether the platform matters. Is there a difference between the iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone versions? Do, for example, Android users respond really well to new skins but iPhone ones don't?</p>

<p>On top of that, assuming I have more than one game out there, technology questions aside, are some types of games more prone to accepting skins? I mentioned a ""puzzle"" one here, but what about other categories of games?</p>

<p>The obvious next question is, if it is worth it, how can I do it without seeming to favor one religion or holiday. I've seen some games that put characters in ""Santa hats,"" but I don't know whether that's going too far or not.</p>
","<p>Like you said a lot of games and other apps do this. That is causing a problem both on the iTunes side and the users side. </p>

<p>Since a lot of games are uploading new versions with holiday artwork, they all have to be approved and updated. <a href=""http://appreviewtimes.com/ios/annual-trend-graph"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appreviewtimes.com/ios/annual-trend-graph</a> </p>

<p>This graph explains everything, halloween, christmas/new year, easter are all holidays which create a huge app update spike. Which means you need to upload the special version at least 2 weeks before the holiday. Which means you need to start working on it 1 month before the holiday.</p>

<p>There is also the user factor, I personally researched about the users reading update changelogs. At holiday times when a user gets 20 updates as a bulk, they don't pay attention to new features, cause there are so many. So these times are the worst times to introduce new features. </p>

<p>Picking a holiday time to reacquire users is also a bad tactic. PPC rates go through the roof, they are constantly bombarded with new app ads and updates. You will have a lower chance to get users attention at these times. </p>

<p>Is it worth it? Personal opinion: Unless you have 10m+ users I don't think its worth the effort. So much competition, stress, work, so little gain.</p>

<p>For 2014 christmas, you are too late to submit a holiday update, don't even think about it. iTunes is shutting down in 3 days, there is no time.</p>

</ol>

<p>I'm sure the above problems have been resolved thousands of times. How do parties typically resolve those issues?</p>
","<p>Most of your concerns are allayed by <em>incorporating</em> the business.  Incorporation creates the legal fiction that the business is a ""person"" in its own right and thereby owns all of its assets; ownership and control of the resulting corporation is divided into shares.</p>

<h3>Risks to the investor</h3>

<p>The investor will usually undertake significant <em>due diligence</em> on the entrepreneur to gain comfort that he is an honest, trustworthy and reliable person in which to invest.  Of course, things can still go wrong, but this exercise should help to minimise the most substantial risks.</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Entrepreneurs may want to steal the invested funds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you're describing is a criminal offence.  If an investor puts money into a corporation, then that money <em>belongs to the corporation</em> and not the entrepreneur.  If the entrepreneur embezzles the invested funds, he commits a criminal offence.</p>

<p>Embezzlement and theft are deterred by the threat of the perpetrator being arrested, convicted and punished (coupled with the fatal reputational damage that would ensue); furthermore, the victim could recover their losses from the perpetrator (if he has enough assets) or possibly even third parties who are in receipt of the stolen money.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Entrepreneurs might be honest yet might not be doing what was expected or might not be doing enough to grow the business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The investment agreement will usually stipulate that the investor has the right to appoint a director (perhaps himself) to the board in order to oversee the business's strategic direction and monitor/control what it does with its assets.  If the investor has more than the requisite proportion (usually 50%) of voting shares, then they could always exercise their control to replace directors in order to remove a completely incompetent entrepreneur (although finding a replacement who shares the vision might be difficult).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Risks to the entrepreneur</h3>

<p>The entrepreneur would do well to speak to other people with whom the investor has worked in the past and find out what they are like as a business partner.  He should also obtain counsel from a competent commercial lawyer, who will know how best to protect against common problems.</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Investors might want to take control over entire company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entrepreneur almost always retains some share of ownership.  Even if that is not a controlling share, the law intervenes to protect minority interests: thus just as an entrepreneur cannot steal invested funds from a corporation, nor can majority shareholders deprive minority interests of their rights.  For example, if a director acts only in the interests of a major shareholder to the detriment of any minorities, he could be in breach of fiduciary duty (incurring significant personal liabilities).</p>

<p>The investment/shareholder agreement may also stipulate further protections for the entrepreneur, any breach of which would give rise to claims in the law of contract.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Investors might be looking to secure their share without investing agreed amount of money in case investment is split into multiple payments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The terms of the investment agreement would usually stipulate what would happen in such a scenario.  It would not be unusual for an investor to receive only shares pro rata to the investment that they have actually delivered up to that point, although the valuation (methodology) to be used for future tranches might be agreed in advance.  Alternative solutions exist and the choice of structure is often motivated by tax concerns, so it is impossible to give general advice in the abstract.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Investors might be looking to walk out in the middle of the plan without investing enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where does one start?</p>

<p>If you have a software tool that has tangible value and the developer community at large would find it useful. How many sales would you make each year in say, the first 5 years?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>[In response to JeremyParsons]</em></p>

<p>I completely agree with Jeremy. I'm talking in really practical terms here. I don't follow the % of huge market concept. I am aware there is no simple answer to this question, but, at the same time. Some effort must be put in to try and get some kind of handle on what your possible market is. I am looking for feedback from others in order to have some guidelines to work against.</p>

"What legal steps do I need to start a website?","140","","<p>I have a domain and I know how to create sites, but what legal steps should I take to ensure my web business is successful?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I should copyright or trademark my name. Also I just don't know if I need to register my business saith any government agency or anything like that.</p>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>I am from the US specifically new Jersey, but I'd like my web business to operate anywhere in the US and eventually world wide.</p>
","<p>You need to look at it from a small perspective first. Don't blind yourself by success before you get there. Websites don't need to have any kind of special license to operate, you just go on NetworkSolutions, GoDaddy, HostGator, etc and register for a domain and boom you are up and running. There are no restrictions on what you can do with your website until you talk about getting legal. So here is what you may need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Design &amp; Copyright:</strong> A lot of companies, especially online ones like to protect their assets and styles by registering their logos, colors and design as official trademarks for their company and theres only. If you use their design, code, colors or logos or other property - you could be sued and that's not the kind of publicity you want for you company, especially if you eventually want to operate worldwide. </p>

<p><strong>Patents:</strong> If you want to patent an invention or design for something materialistic you are going to need to register your patent request to the United States Patent Office (<a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/</a>) - they handle all patent requests. Now, much like registering a Trademark or Registered Trademark, it costs money. Those numbers come directly from the patent office themselves and are in no direct coronation to the size of your company. </p>

<p><strong>Licenses:</strong> Once you get big (assuming you do), you are going to get licenses to operate around the country as different states have different rules and regulations when it comes to different things like shipping, taxes and other operating regulations. For example, you need a license to ship certain goods across the country, same goes for worldwide but thats later. </p>

<p>There are many things that can happen to your company if you do not follow rules and regulations later in the game, but that is what a legal team is for. They can help guide you along your journey and make sure your company will never be at risk of fruad, tax evasion, etc. They are also there to help you keep your ducks in a row so your business can run as smoothly as possible.</p>

"When should I start looking for early adopter?","140","","<p>I am the CEO and CMO of a startup in the app industry. We are currently in development and it's going very well. Our MVP (Minimum Valuable Product) is scheduled to be launch in mid December. We would like to create a Beta test in order to collect valuable usage data and find bugs and missing features (Basically have a general feedback on how good our app is). 
My question is since we want as many people to be part of the beta test as possible. When should I start (as the CMO) seeking for beta tester? </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>- Should I wait and start at the launch? </p>

<p><strong>B</strong>- Should I start prior to the launch and build somewhat of anticipation? (Just like must games nowadays do)(Note here that our app is not a game)</p>

<p>I now this may seems a stupid question to some but I was wondering what could be the best practice. Should I wait to have a somewhat finished product before starting to sell it to potential user or should I get people interest in order to make the launch more successful?</p>

<p>Please note that it is my first startup and I still have a lot to learn.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
","<p>I've been involved in a number of early adopter programs for developers with Microsoft, sometimes on products that were more than two <em>years</em> from potential release, so to hear someone say they are less than five <strong>months</strong> from release and they still don't have anyone outside their company (i.e., adopters) is a bit concerning.  That being said, all is not lost.</p>

<p>Talking with <em>potential</em> customers via social media is all fine and well, but that that's shaky in the sense that at the time you were doing so, this was still more of a conceptual project than a tangible one.  People say many things -- the reality is different when they have an actual product in hand.  Their perception of your product, its usefulness, and their willingness to pay for it changes the moment they go from thinking about it to actually <em>using</em> it.</p>

<p>Early adopter programs have a long tail, frankly because they have to.  It takes a substantial amount of time to find, vet, and select your early adopters (you aren't just going to bring <em>anyone</em> into this, are you?).  Then you have to distribute the product to them and give them plenty of time to try it out and formulate their feedback.  <em>Then</em> you have to go back and make adjustments based on whatever issues or feature enhancements they give you.</p>

<p>Given where you are now, there's not much time to engage in any substantial early adopter program unless you're willing to push back your launch date to account for any unforeseen issues or major changes that need to be made.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to go back to those people who were the most engaged and provided the best feedback during your social media testing and ask them if they'd be willing to try out your product now on an expedited basis.  You'll need to define a timeline with them, because time is of the essence for you, obviously.  You need enough time to adjust based on their input.</p>

<p>It's also a good idea to come up with some kind of compensation plan for those testers who give you timely, useful feedback as a reward for their efforts, even if it's just recognition to the world of their contribution to your product/service.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"How can I pick which technologies to use for my IT business?","139","","<p>As a startup IT company, how should we select technologies to work with, in the interest of improving customer interaction? Is it better to work on trending technologies or should we trust running strong technologies? Newer technologies are coming out every day, so it's difficult to decide what customer will demand for, and switching on technologies is pretty difficult.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>As a it company startup how should be selection of technologies to work on that it will provide high customer interaction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The biggest disservice you can do to your startup is picking a stack you're unfamiliar with.</strong> It means you'll be fighting two battles: the usual one where you need to become familiar with your market; and a bonus (?) one where you need to learn your stack. Don't do that.</p>

<p>Pick one from the ones you're competent with. It's really the only thing that counts. All else being equal, look for things like ""how mature/scalable/what have you"" but also look for ""how cheap is it to find someone competent in this stack"" and ""how smart are the typical people who actually use and know this stack"".</p>

<p>Mind your market, too. As already highlighted, some sectors are voracious for techs they're familiar with and know how to maintain (e.g. Java/Oracle in fintech). In the case of banks it's in part because of Java's merits compared to techs at the time, in part because they all switched from Cobol at around the same time, and in part because there's no shortage of candidates with the requisite skill set in the job marketplace. Whatever the reason though, it matters. (And yes, there are always exceptions. But keep it in mind, because it can be an extra blocker for sales.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also I want to know if it's better to work on trending technologies or should trust on running strong technologies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mature oftentimes (not always, but oftentimes) beats new in my experience.</p>

<p>Taking my introduction to Node.js as an example (admittedly a non-representative one), when Node.js came out in ~2010 or so, I recollect trying it, and getting vividly excited like a lot of other geeks on the web. But upon scratching beneath the surface I was like, seriously?!? The problems related to the architecture were gross (non-blocking io is cool and all but if it's a single-process thing it's not a silver bullet either), the libraries were either non-existant or half-baked and very buggy, there were no frameworks to speak of, the community seemed to all be filled with a handful of competent devs and <em>a lot</em> of much less competent devs or semi-devs, I knew a thing or two about callback hell already... The list of gotchas went on and on, and I thankfully knew better by then to wait and see before giving it a more serious second look. (I've yet to do so.)</p>

<p>If you allow for a slight tangent, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/876089/417194"">always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live</a>. Much the same goes for your stack choices. So when in doubt, stay clear of new tech - even more so if you're unfamiliar with it. (Also, yes: learn a new language per year. But don't make it a point to actually use it in production.)</p>

<p>What actually counts in practice is competent and mature library developers who own what they're doing and are happy owning it. Insist on the latter because, to borrow the words of Yossi Kreinin of C++ FQA fame, if a module's owner doesn't like it, <a href=""http://yosefk.com/blog/redundancy-vs-dependencies-which-is-worse.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">expect some pretty lousy bug gardening job</a>.

"How do network effect businesses effectively validate product/market fit?","139","","<blockquote>
  <p>The value of network effect businesses improve with more users. Examples
  are Facebook, Skype, eBay, Twitter, StackExchange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These kinds of businesses usually need a minimum viable mass (like Harvard for Facebook) to really validate if they have product market fit. So they build an MVP and also get a MVM to prove they are worthy.</p>

<p>Because of this customer development is critical to validate the product upfront before building it. </p>

<p>What is the most effective way to validate the product before it has a minimum viable mass? How do the other successful companies that don't luck out on the product do this?</p>
","<p>In my opinion, there is no single correct answer to this question, though I've used a number of different options as an approach to addressing this issue:</p>

<p><strong>Fake it:</strong> This approach has been used a lot and has its issues. Core issue is that long-term you can't run a business on a fake network and there's always the potential for backlash legally and to good will. That said, it's a common solution, and as always, it's really up to the business to decide what's best for it.</p>

<p><strong>Simulation:</strong> Pretty much the same thing as faking it, though it's clear to the users that the network is being feed/run by the company.</p>

<p><strong>Substitution:</strong> This is not the same thing as faking it or simulation. Basically, you find a way to offer substitute for what in the future will be driven by the network. Core issue with this approach is sourcing the substitution and that the substitution is not the same thing as the ""real"" network.</p>

<p><strong>Proxy:</strong> This approach is basically the same thing as substitution, though the intent is to use an existing network real-time as if it was your own. Clearly, there are a number of issues with this, though this has also been done before, and worth noting as an option.</p>

<p><strong>Limited launch:</strong> This is often the best approach, that being to very selectively pick an existing network to provide the product to, then if possible, leverage that success to grow beyond the network used to launch the network. This is the approach that Facebook and others has used with great success.</p>

<p>That said, based on my experience, it's possible to do valid customer development without a product that's in final form. Generally speaking, all that's required to validate a network effect based product is that the customer understands that intent and function of the product.  Next step is to ask each customer in the first dev-cycle to invite 7-12 of their existing network to take part in the next customer development cycle.  If you get enough traction leaping through the networks manually, then that's a very good indicator for the future of the product and its related network. Clearly, having something real to show a customer is better than not, but more often than not you'll learn more by directly engaging customers as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Building on the above, when you're scaling a product knowing the minimum viable network required to onboard new user network clusters is critical. If you're aware that a network has a user that has not been onboarded and another that to your knowledge has no existing connections, you're much more likely to land the user with existing connections than the user with no connections. Further, if you're able to map networks of users before their onboard you might even attempt to find an optimal path through the network to insure you're focusing on the right users to execute a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging_%28strategy%29"" rel=""nofollow"">leapfrogging strategy</a> on.</p>

<p>I'm putting together a slick well seo-d website, but would rather get boots on the ground and talk to some real people!</p>

<p>We've both been working for various software companies for 10+ years, so i'm comfortable with both our technical abilities and with our ability to deal with people, but i'm not sure where to go or who to talk to to get started. We're project scale and stack agnostic, so will do projects of any size on the tech that suits the client/project best. </p>

<p>We're fully commited so open to traveling anywhere in the world (Currently UK based) and putting in whatever effort is required.</p>
","<p>You need to think about two things: <strong>selling to the world</strong> and <strong>selling to <em>your</em> world</strong>.</p>

<p>First, selling to the world. It's relatively unlikely that there are lots of people searching for a two person software consultancy willing to take on any size project on any technology stack anywhere in the world. So you should <strong>choose a niche</strong>. </p>

<p>How do you do that? Well, you want to <strong>start out with an unfair advantage</strong>. So pick an industry sector, a project type and a technology focus where you have credentials - where real people are going to be willing to give you testimonials. Do your SEO homework. If nobody is searching for this, it may be too fine a niche. If every keyword and combination comes up as super expensive for paid search, maybe it's too competitive. And if you can't think of posts and pages where you can show depth and point of view while building out a website that will work up the page rankings, you either need to do more research or try another field.</p>

<p>Once you have your niche, <strong>you have the basis of a marketing programme</strong>. You can build lists of prospective customers, find out where they gather in the real world and online, work out what level in the organisation the decision makers sit, start writing content that you can push to LinkedIn, produce white papers or ebooks people can pay for with their email address. You can interview people, get their stories, find the pain points, start to design and test value propositions that have more resonance than ""hire us by the hour and we'll do our best for you."" You can network for all you're worth, and put in place the activities that will generate a sales funnel.</p>

<p>All this is possible because you made hard choices. <strong>Targeted is what makes ""busy"" productive; scattergun almost never works.</strong></p>

<p>But what about selling to <em>your</em> world? Consultancy is all about developing relationships. So you need to <strong>draw up a list of all the decision makers and influencers you know</strong>. And you need to reach out to them, let them know what you're doing, how you'd like to help make their lives better and how you'd like them to help you - giving you opportunities, recommending you, feeding back, whatever.</p>

<p>Personal networks work differently than the world at large. In particular, where you're already known, people will have an idea of areas where you could help, and if you build relationships and communication channels, <strong>a personal connection won't worry that the opportunity they're bringing you relates to the skills they know you have, not the brand and proposition you've chosen</strong>.</p>

<p>In the long run, you'll be investing maybe a third of your time looking for projects. Today, it's nearer 100%. So <strong>make sure you're investing time, not just expending it</strong>.</p>

Your main objective to drive adoption of your product (or service) and that requires that you have a product that some market segment would like to use. Regardless of the name, your focus should be testing that users would part with money (or time) for it.   Once you've established some level of traction, a business name can potentially help you scale, but really it's just a name that people know to call your company or product.  </p>

<p>The big key to remember is that you can change the name (and logo) once you've got enough traction to make it worth scaling your marketing effort beyond just finding the first early adopters.  So the first rule is not to let naming take much of your attention in the early days of your business and do not worry at all about finding a name that will last long.  You'll have to pivot several times as you discover what product will sell and what kind of buyers or users it attracts.  </p>

<p>Apple and Google are only great names because they became great companies.  There is nothing inherent in those names that make them great.  So just focus on the company, and whatever name you pick will eventually either change or become great because your company becomes great.</p>

<p>Having said all that, here are a few basics to getting some kind of name so you can move on.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>focus on something you can get a website for, so that means more than
5 letters (unless you're willing to buy a domain from someone else). 
Internic's whois (<a href=""http://www.internic.net/whois.html"">http://www.internic.net/whois.html</a>) is a good
place to test a domain name to see if it's available.</p></li>
<li><p>fanciful names (rather than existing words) are much better to avoid trademark issues so avoid dictionary words.  Portmanteau words can work but adjust them a bit to make them less obvious and more evocative than descriptive. 
For instance, Apple could be very hard to get a trademark on (even if
it weren't an existing company) if your business was related to the
food industry.  Instead just pick something pronounceable and
reasonably short (but not too short).  There are several websites to
generate brand names and you can easily find those sites through a
Google search (try ""brand name generator"").  Most of the ones these sites generate are not particularly
great names, but they can get you started.  Just go with something
reasonably useful, adjust it a bit if you like, make sure you can get
the website, and move on.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get a quick and inexpensive logo for your name from several design sites on the internet (such as <a href=""https://www.fiverr.com"">Fiverr</a>; there are many
others).  Often I'll pay the $5 (or whatever) and then use that
logo either as it is, or adjust it to fit my sense of aesthetics (I'm a
reasonably handy amateur graphic designer, but it doesn't have to be
that great).  I know I'll change it later if the business takes off.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So just pick something (set a limit of no say more than 2-4 hours if even that to search and decide) and move on.  It may help you to think of your first company or brand name as a temporary code word to use until you attract enough customers to make it worthwhile to re-look at it when you're ready to scale your marketing (say after a 100 or more customers).  Many successful companies have names that you probably wouldn't have picked if you just saw the name without any other context.</p>

<p>Above all, don't let perfect be the enemy of good.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"Process of obtaining leads?","136","","<p>I'm not even sure how to start. As a small business, I'm pretty good at what I do. Unfortunately, I have a hard time trying to get potential leads into my funnel. Now my question now is, is there a particular workflow available on how to obtain leads? Example:</p>

<p><code>Find interested clients &gt; speak to them over the phone &gt; agree on scope &gt; send them proposal &gt; if they approve, do the job &gt; Get paid &gt; etc...</code></p>

<p>Is there a name for this process? I'm not even sure what to call it. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Find interested clients > speak to them over the phone > agree on scope > send them proposal > if they approve, do the job > Get paid > etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... might not be fantasy in practice, but it's certainly horrific a process.</p>

<p>FWIW, and at a high level, best practice usually is closer to this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find interested leads or get them to find you (that's marketing's job).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Qualify</em> each lead in a 10-min phone call. Qualified means:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>pain point</strong> that you can solve</li>
<li>A <strong>decision</strong> maker</li>
<li>A sensible <strong>timeline</strong></li>
<li>An adequate <strong>budget</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Politely nurture or dismiss, depending, any lead that doesn't tick each box. Discuss and agree on scope with those that do in one or more discovery calls. Upon completing the latter phase, schedule an actual <em>proposal call</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Present and defend your proposal during the proposal call (avoid revealing it beforehand unless you can ""leak"" it to an inside ally to check if it stands a good chance). The point of this call is so you can address any questions, concerns, doubts, and objections on the fly, then and there.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the deal in the proposal call if possible. If not, agree to a date where you should follow up - and do so, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>Receive the signed contract and what the client agreed to pay in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>Now work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The crucial bit, really, is to qualify your leads. Many companies make do without any formalized discovery calls or proposal calls, but I've never seen one succeed without proper qualification criteria in place and enforced. If you're wasting time with unqualified leads with no intent or ability to buy soon all the time, then you're, well, wasting time.</p>

<p>The above assumes you've a rescue sequence/process at most steps (in case the lead becomes unresponsive) of course.</p>

<p>Getting back to your question, the above is called a sales process.</p>

<p>Based on the title though, you're looking for a lead generation process. That's too broad for a question here unfortunately, and it entirely depends on the business your into.</p>

<p>As a tip, though, check out <a href=""https://steveblank.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Blank's blog</a>. It's genuinely full of good advice on how to figure out the lead gen process that works for you. (Start with the older posts, and skim chronologically.)

"Why would a website startup need funding?","135","","<p>I have a decent startup idea on web and for smartphones, but no experience on entrepreneurship except what I read online. So, I had been looking up for the choices people made to build successful websites. I realize almost all great websites have a significant funding in exchange for a great deal of shares which proved to be extremely valuable today. Therefore I can tell funding is a must, only that I don't really know what I would need it for (or what facebook needed it for, for example). I really thought about it, and still have no idea. </p>

<p>Only answers I could think of were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Development costs</li>
<li>Hosting costs</li>
<li>Marketing costs</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a developer myself and I think I can set up everything technical in a year. I am already hosting online for free to test, but I plan to set up my own servers to meet increasing demand. This hardware should cost something significant for me, but nothing I can't save in a year. I am willing to meet this expense myself because if I really need to pay hardware to host my website it means I am already successful. And for marketing costs, I have friends who are extremely active worldwide. We already came up with some interesting ideas which would cost very little but may reach to many of my target audience. Another thing is if my hosting expenses increase with the number of users or if I need technical help to add new features quickly, initial earnings from advertisements could be spent to those expenses along with my own small contributions.</p>

<p>Given the situation I am in, I still think there must be a reason all successful websites needed investment. Am I underestimating any of those steps, being unrealistic about development, hosting or marketing? Or am I completely ignoring another significant cost? (for example I never truly looked into legal costs if there is any)</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate if someone with experience/knowledge about this topic can give me their opinion on funding as I really do not want to go blindly into this project. </p>
","<p>Here are some thoughts on this.</p>

<p>You don't need money to start a company short of paying for your operational expenses, etc.  On a web-based business, costs of web servers have come down a lot in recent years so you can probably afford these for the short term.  When I built my first web business (long gone with the first internet bust), server fees ran me about $1k a month as compared to $30 now.</p>

<p>Marketing and Advertising, as mentioned before are areas you'll need to spend on, but as you mentioned you're going to rely on word of mouth, etc to grow the business.</p>

<p>Legal fees and the other incidental costs are relatively cheap if you need them for minor things.</p>

<p>So, no, you don't really need investment money to start a web-based business, especially if you're going to stay small and run this as a lifestyle business (i.e. earning enough to live on, but no goals to be the next Twitter).</p>

<p>That being said, if you do have grand visions of being the next Facebook (Twitter is a world of hurt, business wise, so don't dream on that front), then you will need investment money.</p>

<p>Imagine you have the classic hockey stick growth curve (i.e. slow growth for awhile and then suddenly everyone wants to use your service), you'll suddenly find yourself needing more and more server capacity and not the kind you get from GoDaddy.  If you don't have money, you'll find yourself really hurting to handle that exponential growth.</p>

<p>Investment money is also good to allow your company to move very fast against any potential competitors and to hire highly skilled developers to make the moves happen faster and better.</p>

<p>I recommend listening to Episode 2 of Masters of Scale by Reid Hoffman <a href=""https://mastersofscale.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://mastersofscale.com</a> where he talks about money (a transcript is also online if you don't want to listen).</p>

<p>However, even if after reading this, you decide that you do want to get investment money, unless Mark Zuckerberg introduces you to Sequoia Capital himself (or someone else of high standing), there's a slim chance that you'll get the opportunity to pitch your idea (imagine how many pitches these folks get).</p>

<p>So, in order to get the attention of a VC, build your business to be moderately successful, not not so successful you'll bankrupt yourself and then start talking to investors (or wait until they call you).</p>

<p>Also, you can't learn entrepreneurship online or by taking classes.  You may learn the framework for it, but the only way to learn how to do a startup is to do a startup.</p>

<p>So, just build it, since you already seem to have market fit.</p>

I also want to provide the name of my website to some agencies which are focused on freelancing artists, so the name of my website has to be easy to remember.
I want it to be the first step for launching a sort of personal ""brand"" in the future, so it is a business-oriented project and it may become a small enterprise.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself I'd rule out using such a domain for that reason alone. At least in your early days, and possibly later, you'll have an uphill battle to get any type of search visibility. Not to mention typos when your users or journalists write about your site, hindering you further.</p>

<p>Is there any formal difference between these rounds or are they just a way of labeling investing periods? If there is, what is the timeline or process for a startup to proceed through these rounds?</p>
","<p>I liked your question so I upvoted it... but then I kept thinking about it so I went and did some research.  Here's what I found  (as you can imagine, there's so much between the situation of each startup that these numbers and statements are just ballpark figures and generalizations):</p>

<p><strong>Seed Funding (or Series Seed):</strong> A few hundred thousand to a couple million dollars of funding. Funding is raised based on as little as an idea and a nice presentation, maybe a prototype or mockup depending on the scenario. A few months to a year.</p>

<p><strong>Series A Funding</strong>: Ready to launch. A few million to $15 million to be used to scale up and start bringing in the first revenues. Apparently significantly harder to get than Seed Funding. Several sites were using the phrase ""Series A Crunch"" to refer to the fact that the availability of investors willing to give out the smaller sums of money for the potential of an idea is significantly higher than those willing to give out much larger sums of money on an idea that is still not proven.  Startups going this route with funding really need to fight hard to get ahead and differentiate themselves from the thousands of other startups looking for series A money. Milestones, goals, and deadlines are set to know when the work for Series A is complete and Series B is ready.</p>

<p><strong>Series B Funding</strong>:  The viability of the idea has been proven (or not) at this point and it should have a growing userbase. This stage is looking for funding to continue building out the service offered by the startup in preparation for the next phase of focused growth through user acquisition.  A couple of sites I read called this the hardest series to find investors for because it was neither the high risk high reward early phase or the lower risk reliable reward series C.  Again certain goals and milestones unique to the project would be set to determine the length and scope of this phase.</p>

<p><strong>Series C Funding</strong>: The development phase is now essentially complete and it is time to focus on growth, growth, growth, and did I mention growth? You are now fairly well established and tested. Considered a relatively safe investment as long as you show that you can really bring in the numbers as far as gaining users. That's the key to getting series C funding one you've made it this far. They want to see that you can take this proven brand and make it a household name because every new user adds a bit of equity to the company and their bank account grows just a little bit more.</p>

<p>There seems to be some fluidity with the terms, but for the most part this is how I understood the information I ingested.</p>

<p>Minimum Viable Product</p>

<p>This is working out what is the smallest thing you can build that makes it viable to launch - i.e. do you need the automated bot that handles queries before launch or can you fake it by running queries manually? that kind of thing. </p>

<p>Until you launch you don't really know if anyone wants your product or service. So launching late and then finding out no one wants it has wasted much of your time and your investors money. Far better for everyone to 'Fail fast' as then you have enough money left to recover and 'pivot' into a new market or direction - or alternatively succeed and grow, building those supporting systems after the fact.</p>

<p>Your responsibility is to ship it, get it to market. 
Put meetings in  once a week to talk strategy and big picture with your team so that you are involved and to make sure that during development you haven't just gone off in an alternate direction without communicating it</p>

I am the only person involved and I would like to separate my side-income from my full-time income for tax reasons and for the ability to write-off deductions related to consulting. The last requirement of the entity would be some level of protection/separation of my personal assets from business liabilities (e.g. lawsuit, damage caused by consulting). Any input is appreciated.</p>

<p>Location: Georgia, United States</p>
","<p>You have asked to do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Separate side job from employment for tax purposes</li>
<li>Provide protection from damages / suit against you for side income purposes</li>
</ol>

<p>In the US, you can operate your side business as a sole-proprietorship (no incorporation) and take associated tax deductions (home office, phone, expenses, etc.). You can, of course, also incorporate (LLC may be best) so you can determine whether to have the LLC income be taxed as pass-thru income, or as a corporation.</p>

<p>For legal protection, however, you would need some form of corporate entity -- or you should make sure that the agreement under which you work has the customer agree that accept your work without recourse.  (An LLC could provide the former protection.) If you are concerned about liability, you may also want to look at obtaining business insurance for such issues (your home owners + umbrella policy may also be able to handle potential claims up to $1M .. or your umbrella limit).</p>

"How should one gain first users on brand new social website?","131","","<p>Suppose I open new web site that is kinda like social media with some specific purpose.  Immediately I see big problem - no matter how hard you would advertise your site and how much money you will spend, the guy who goes on your website and sees something like 0-10 users total he will not have any motivation to register there, even if the concept is good, because he expects a lot of different people there with whom he can interact. And registering just with hope that it will be better makes no sense too if site is almost empty, average user don't expect the site going from 10 users to 10k in a month.<br>
At first I thought of just creating 1000 or so fake accounts, but it would become obvious that they are fake if none of them replies to PM or replies with some generic bot phrases. So this is dead giveaway. </p>

<p>What is the solution for this problem?</p>
","<p>In my opinion, there is no single correct answer to this question, though I've used a number of different options as an approach to addressing this issue:</p>

<p><strong>Fake it:</strong> This approach has been used a lot and has its issues. Core issue is that long-term you can't run a business on a fake network and there's always the potential for backlash legally and to good will. That said, it's a common solution, and as always, it's really up to the business to decide what's best for it.</p>

<p><strong>Simulation:</strong> Pretty much the same thing as faking it, though it's clear to the users that the network is being feed/run by the company.</p>

<p><strong>Substitution:</strong> This is not the same thing as faking it or simulation. Basically, you find a way to offer substitute for what in the future will be driven by the network. Core issue with this approach is sourcing the substitution and that the substitution is not the same thing as the ""real"" network.</p>

<p><strong>Proxy:</strong> This approach is basically the same thing as substitution, though the intent is to use an existing network real-time as if it was your own. Clearly, there are a number of issues with this, though this has also been done before, and worth noting as an option.</p>

<p><strong>Limited launch:</strong> This is often the best approach, that being to very selectively pick an existing network to provide the product to, then if possible, leverage that success to grow beyond the network used to launch the network. This is the approach that Facebook and others has used with great success.</p>

<p>That said, based on my experience, it's possible to do valid customer development without a product that's in final form. Generally speaking, all that's required to validate a network effect based product is that the customer understands that intent and function of the product.  Next step is to ask each customer in the first dev-cycle to invite 7-12 of their existing network to take part in the next customer development cycle.  If you get enough traction leaping through the networks manually, then that's a very good indicator for the future of the product and its related network. Clearly, having something real to show a customer is better than not, but more often than not you'll learn more by directly engaging customers as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Building on the above, when you're scaling a product knowing the minimum viable network required to onboard new user network clusters is critical. If you're aware that a network has a user that has not been onboarded and another that to your knowledge has no existing connections, you're much more likely to land the user with existing connections than the user with no connections. Further, if you're able to map networks of users before their onboard you might even attempt to find an optimal path through the network to insure you're focusing on the right users to execute a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging_%28strategy%29"" rel=""nofollow"">leapfrogging strategy</a> on.</p>

"Pricing our product","131","","<p>Is it better to make a cost-based price or a value-based price for tech low-cost innovations? Taking into account we are developing an idea where there are low or none competition. I heard that for tech products (applications with some other external stuff to make it work) the best thing is to set a value-based price.</p>
","<p>FYI there's another - unfortunate - category: market-based pricing, which you can observe when a commodity's price is set by factors you've essentially no control on. It's not a nice or fun situation to be in, because your profitability is strictly related to how low your costs can be.</p>

<p>Cost-based pricing is what most businesses do: work out your marginal cost, slap a margin you're comfortable with, and have your sales sell at that price. With good marketing you can end up with a stronger brand than your competitor and can get away with higher prices. It works.</p>

<p>Value-based pricing is the most profitable <em>but</em> it assumes you've highly skilled sales staff. Training an engineer (it'll usually be one) to be a sales is hard enough; training one to get clients to put a number on whatever is causing them pain, and anchoring your product's price against <em>that</em> is... Let's just say it's <em>feasible</em> but definitely not <em>simple</em>, and it takes a very special type of pedigree. (It can also be lengthier, and that can eat into your profit margins.)</p>

"Being kicked out from the startup by my cofounders: how to deal with it?","130","","<p>I have cofounded a startup several years ago and valued it above anything else. I tend to get really passionate about things I love. All my life was inside this startup. I put more energy and effort than the CEO. But then we ran out of money, and the problems began. We discovered fundamental differences in our mindsets, values, and goals. I got kicked out from the team. </p>

<p>This is when I discovered that this startup was an essential part of my identity. When networking, I was presenting myself as ""<code>&lt;name&gt;</code> from <code>&lt;company X&gt;</code>, we are working on <code>&lt;project Y&gt;</code>"". I felt like I was on a mission.</p>

<p>Now, I have to rewrite my personal branding, and I struggle with it. I am still attached to the old project. Even now, I tend to talk to everyone about this startup. </p>

<p>Just out of passion, I started doing small tasks for them again, for low pay, as a freelancer (not a core team member). That's because I didn't want to give up on this project.</p>

<p>But I am not delusional and I understand that I have to find my own life.</p>

<p>What are the best practices of dealing with this situation?</p>
","<p>This is very much like dealing with grief. Essentially you had a vision of your future and it involved that particular start up. Now you have to live your life without that particular future as a possibility. much like dealing with any absense.</p>

<p>What you need is:</p>

<p>Time to process. This is the best healer for most situations of absence.</p>

<p>To talk about it: This is how we process. Lay the mental groundwork and limit the likelihood that trauma will stick around and turn into things like PTSD (I'm not saying it would in this case, just letting you know how talking spreads trauma thinner and is good for our mental health in these cases)</p>

<p>find something to replace it with. This one can sound callous and cold. However, at the very least it acts as a distraction while you give yourself time to talk about it. At best, it actually fills the gap that is missing. This does not have to be another startup. It can be a hobby, a partner, a pet, a computer game... </p>

"What exactly is the dot com bust? Why did it affect startups in a huge scale?","129","","<p>I keep hearing phrases like <em>""For a startup which survived the dot com bust, .......""</em>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>So, what exactly is the dot com bust?</strong></p>

<p>I have gone through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble"">wikipedia page of the ""Dot com bubble""</a> but the finance terms are  bit heavy for me, so I'm looking for a bit simpler explanation</p>

<p>And <strong>also, why and how did it affect startups at that time in such a huge scale?</strong></p>
","<p>The dot com bust was a period of hubris that occurred around when the Internet crept into businesses and households. (And in a sense it was phase one of a much larger asset bubble which began to deflate after 2007.)</p>

<p>For context, there basically was a gold rush back then. It was unclear what would work online and what wouldn't. Or so collective memory would want us to remember. The reality is it <em>was</em> pretty clear what would work back then already for those who were keen observers, and you <em>could</em> read very sensible online commentary on the merits, or lack thereof, of this or that business idea and business model. The issue, of course, were that a) investors were too busy getting rich by speculating to take note, b) young founders ""knew better"", and c) some VCs were cynically throwing whatever money they could get their hands on at walls, hoping something would stick.</p>

<p>In the end, many new companies with dubious business plans got funded at the time, in the hopes that they'd do a land grab and lock their target market before other entrants came. One succeeded pretty well in this sense: amazon.com. Many didn't.</p>

<p>These companies characteristically thought big and prioritized growth over profitability - at all costs. This led to exuberant spending to attract highly sought after talent, over-hiring, and over-investment. That led to outsized burn rates (e.g. boo.com burnt through $135M of VC money in 18 months) and, later, spectacular bankruptcies.</p>

<p>(Fun facts in passing: HTML ""coding"" was such a sought after skill at one point that it gave rise to <a href=""http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/uncyclopedia/images/1/15/Will_code_html_for_food.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070820063439"">this hoax</a>, and you could find job offers in 1999 that required 10-years of Java experience - Java was then a 4-year old language.)</p>

<p>It was also a period of reckless risk taking and rampant fraud. The risk taking was not new in itself. <a href=""http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/manifesto/"">Private leverage</a> had already reached bubble proportions during the Reagan era. It merely zoomed even higher at an accelerated rate. (And it continued to increase even after the Nasdaq crashed, hence my earlier comment that it was merely phase one of the 2007 bubble.)</p>

<p>All that money needed to go <em>somewhere</em>. A combination of euphoria and fraud led it to the tech sector. The tech sector was a natural fit, of course, owing to its novelty and the idea that we were entering a ""New Economy"". But analysts also contributed, by pumping tech stocks prior to IPOs like there was no tomorrow. A few of them (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Blodget"">Henry Blodget</a>) actually got condemned for doing so all while knowing they were promoting garbage. Methinks they were scapegoats to some extent - all investment analysts were arguably contributing to pumping tech stocks back then. Journalists happily - and uncritically - went along with the narrative anyways. And so did investors.</p>

<p>There occasionally was some accounting fraud in the companies themselves as well - most notably at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Inc."">Worldcom</a>, which got caught after the second round of stock crashing that occurred in the wake of 9/11. (In other fraud news, the folks from <a href=""http://www.deepcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/deepcapture-the-story-v1.pdf"">DeepCapture</a> would surely add that naked short-sellers helped the bubble grow and pop. But that's another story.)</p>

<p>In the end, money dried up after the Nasdaq crash. Overnight, a business plan that would have gotten you millions of VC money in a heartbeat just weeks earlier was deemed too risky to touch with a 10-foot pole.</p>

<p>Existing companies with oversized burn rates had to rapidly revisit their head counts and their investment plans. To give you a sense of the scale, back in early 2,000 my 8 colleagues and I were in an office that could comfortably fit 120 people. We were trying to raise €150M to spend in 2 years. 6 month later we had revisited our business plan twice, and failed to raise €50M and €15M. We shut down and returned what remained of the initial investors' money.</p>

<p>We were far from being the only ones who closed shop... Many more companies were forced to shut down after running out of money. Even more companies never managed to get any funding to begin with.</p>

","<p>I think it all depends on what you need the money for and what you have to show currently. Kickstarter and its backers expect to have a clear idea of what the product is, what you need the money for and when you will deliver the product.</p>

"Liability Insurance: how much is the right amount for a tech startup?","128","","<p>How much liability insurance would be a good idea to have given these factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tech startup (a bit of everything, including flagship app under development (with a financial focus))</li>
<li>Physical/legal entity in British Columbia Canada</li>
<li>Fairly tight cash flow</li>
<li>Organized as a proprietorship currently (so no liability cutout really)</li>
<li>Some tasks that we do include:
<ul>
<li>full website creation</li>
<li>website maintenance/updating</li>
<li>deal with hardware/software issues as necessary for clients (including by redirecting to others)</li>
<li>soon a financial app that will handle lots of important data including taxes, payroll etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>physical location is covered under other insurance.</li>
</ul>

<p>So with those factors what would be the minimum recommended amount of liability insurance and what would you consider to be a better amount?</p>
","<p>For a startup, if you have no customers, you probably need the cash more than the insurance.  Once you start having customers (and in order to get some customers such as public institutions and government organizations) you will likely need, at minimum, Errors and Omissions (E&amp;O) insurance.  For a startup a small policy will work. I've found that a typically standard $1 million per claim and $2 million aggregate E&amp;O and general liability insurance will meet the minimum requirements of some of the organizations I've consulted with and sold to, and costs well under $1,000 per year. Insurance availability and cost will vary greatly depending on your location and business, but this should help you understand the ballpark figures you might see.</p>

<p>Today's online businesses hold a lot more sensitive data, and there have been many lawsuits recently concerning data breaches and other similar problems.  While you could probably handle many good customers before running into this issue, you should consider getting additional insurance that covers your specific exposure to liability.</p>

<p>Data breach insurance is available, for instance. </p>

<p>These primarily protect you from lawsuits brought by customers and other external to your company.  There are a number of risks coming from inside your company as it grows.  When it's just you and a dozen others, working for little actual cash, if the company fails none of you are particularly hurt.  If a computer dies, you make due with extra personnel equipment until the company is cash positive.  Everyone's using their own equipment, so major loss of a building or equipment is unlikely - you probably carry your laptop home with you.  If something major does happen you have friends, family, and the local library to fall back on while you sort things out.</p>

<p>Some time in the future you'll hit a tipping point where internal problems expose you to significant risk.  You have too many employees and too many deadlines, and if something breaks you have to be able to recover, but it won't work like it used to.  You'll need outside help.</p>

<p>Many types of insurance cover your equipment, office, employees, and a variety of problems you might face.  If you have a few employees absolutely critical to your work you might even choose to purchase ""key man"" life insurance so your business doesn't fail when they die.  Other insurances include disability insurance, health insurance, worker's compensation insurance, etc.</p>

<p>In a lean mean 2-5 person startup, you might not need any insurance.  As you gain customers you should consider E&amp;O insurance.  As you gain employees and incorporate you need many types of insurance.</p>

<p>You can give a 10% to each of them and sign a shareholders agreement where you specify what they have to accomplish to get the equity:</p>

"How do I choose a product to make in my startup","127","","<p>I always think about how to choose a product to make if I start a start up company.
Is there any way to determine if a product might be good to make in the future?</p>

<p>What do people like me do?</p>
","<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since you clarified that you want to know about the product</p>

<p>Typically, how you select a product to make depends on several things</p>

<ol>
<li>Market gap - Your product must fill a need in the market that current products do not address adequately. You can find gaps from personal experience or through talking to people who use the product category. Your product idea can enhance an existing product category with new features, make it cheaper or make it more efficient at what it is doing. For example, web cameras are very standard today and have standard features. If you make an asic that enables web cameras to do something different say 3D or depth sensing, that can be a new product.</li>
<li>Market need - Your product must be something a customer would need and would pay for. If your product is not very different from the competitors or has features that they do not really need then you would have a hard time selling it.</li>
<li>Your startup's capability - Sometimes even if you come with a new product idea, you may not have the resources to make it. Financial capability is usually a limitation for startups but there can be others such as access to manufacturers, raw materials or legal constraints. Assess your product idea against your resources to see if your startup can actually do it.</li>
<li>Technical feasibility - Very obviously, your product idea must be technically feasible. </li>
<li>Legality - Find out if any part of your idea has been patented. There are sites like patents.google.com or the USPTO website that you can use to search for patents. If a key part of your idea has been patented, you have the option of licensing and paying a royalty to them or changing your design so it does not infringe on the existing patent. Your country may also have laws governing your product category and have restrictions on capability that you may have to abide by.</li>
<li>Cost feasibility - Your product has to have give better value to the customer than existing products. If you product features are same as the competitor products and you are charging more than them, then your product would have a hard time getting market acceptance. If your product has new features, find out how much the customer can pay for it, and see if you can make and sell your product for that price while making a decent profit.</li>
</ol>

<p>So a good place to start would be to talk to people who might consume your product category. If you want to make asics, it would be designers and manufacturers of electronic products. Talk to them or observe the market to find a gap that you feel you can fill. </p>

<p>There is a discussion on new product idea generation on this page <a href=""http://davidcummings.org/2015/05/25/new-product-idea-generation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidcummings.org/2015/05/25/new-product-idea-generation/</a></p>

<p>Assuming that you are asking which skills you need for a future in a startup .. </p>

<p>There are three options I can think of that you can use to enter into startups. One unique thing about startups is that since there usually is a resource/staff shortage, being able to wear multiple hats or play multiple roles is generally desirable. This is why early stage startups like full stack developers. In your case, the more you know about the full asic development process from creating design specs, rtl and logic coding, to floor planning and physical layout to chip production the better it would be. </p>

<p>If you want to simply work in a startup, then your present skills are fine. You just have to find a startup that is doing hardware products that require asics. There are startup specific job boards like startuphire.com, angel.co and ventureloop.com. Working in a startup as an employee can give you insights into how entrepreneurs manage their business, raise finance, prioritize decisions etc. Skills needed: hands on technical skills</p>

<p>If you have well rounded skills including product development and project management skills, you can try to join as a cofounder. Many business oriented entrepreneurs without technical skills seek a cofounder to help them make the product they have in mind. A technical cofounder typically should have hands on and at least some top level experience of designing a product and managing the development process. You can search for people looking for cofounders on sites like cofounderslab.com. Skills needed: hands on technical skills, product management skills, project management skills, delegating and supervision, outsourcing and integration, providing specs to manufacturers etc. </p>

<p>Finally you have the option of starting up yourself. You would need to come up with a unique product or service idea, raise finance and a team to market validate it, and produce it. The skills requirement would vary depending on the team you have. For example, if you find people to help you manage your product then you can delegate that. Skills needed: Business planning, operations management, people skills to network and build a team, financial planning, resources to raise finance. Going forward, you would find that you would need your technical skills less and business skills more as you can delegate technical work and you as the founder would need to making more big picture decisions.</p>

<p>You can also plan your career as an entrepreneur. You can find work in a startup as an employee and gain the skills needed to be a cofounder and then make the jump to a cofounder in another startup. There you can observe and learn the business skills  your counter part has and build a network with investors and c level people. You can then choose to startup on your own.</p>

Well i answered which everyone will is that i will generate revenue from my startup and i am solving a big problem of outdoor advertising industry which is giving me a big satisfaction and peace as entrepreneur. </p>

<p>Now I'm confused that <em>can there be a better answer/reply than this</em>? </p>
","<p>Every investor, advisor or business lecturer I've listened to says the same thing. You only start a business because of pure passion for what you're doing. </p>

","<p>Specifically in the context of <em>freelancing</em>&horbar;</p>

<h3>Advantages </h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Limited liability</strong></p>

<p>Should it all go titsup, you will be liable only for called-up unpaid share capital&mdash;often minimal to nothing&mdash;<em>unless</em> you've broken the law (or have given personal guarantees, which you should avoid doing at all costs).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tax</strong></p>

<p>If you're making over ~£40k/year, you can reduce your tax burden by incorporating (and then taking salary up to the basic rate tax threshold with the remainder received by way of dividend&mdash;although note that your personal creditors may ignore dividend income when deciding your capacity for borrowing).  However, beware of falling foul of <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ir35/"">IR35</a>: if HMRC deem that you are in fact employed by your clients and not a contractor, the tax burden through using such a company will be <em>greater</em> than if you were paid PAYE.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>Since the company will be employing you, it must have employer's liability insurance and comply with employers' health and safety obligations.  You also have a duty to direct the company fairly in the interests of your creditors.  Failing to do so, for example by trading whilst insolvent, can give rise to personal liability or even criminal sanctions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assets</strong></p>

<p>The company's assets belong to the company&mdash;not you.  You must be careful to use them only for the company's benefit, or else there will be tax consequences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Administration</strong></p>

<p>There are additional filing and record-keeping obligations, but the burden isn't really much more cumbersome than that which you would have to do anyway for an unincorporated business.  Biggest things are minutes, payroll, annual report/accounts and corporation tax returns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Winding up</strong></p>

<p>When you've finished trading, a company can be costly and complicated to shut down.</p></li>

<p>Things to remember:</p>

<p>1.Must be clearly visible (I think an alert is sufficient) </p>

<p>2.Must be documented. On their reciepts that I assume you will be e-mailing to them re-document the policy</p>

<p>3.Watch the wording. Don't make it tricky to understand plainly state, ""We keep all incorrect amounts, no exceptions, This includes underpayment, for which you will not be refunded""</p>

"How unusual is it to not be told how many shares of a company are outstanding?","126","","<p>I work for a startup that for a few years was self-funded by a wealthy founder with a very good track record. To my knowledge, no employee has ever been told how many shares are outstanding, despite asking multiple times. I have exercised stock options and as a shareholder, I receive notices about increases in the employee pool, but not the total pool. We are also never told a predicted valuation. Instead, we are always told our shares should be worth $XX-$YY each. Furthermore, recently we received external investment and were not told how much it was for (though this trickled out unofficially) nor what the investors received.</p>

<p>How unusual is this situation? Do I have any recourse for getting the necessary information to make my own determination of what my shares might be worth?</p>
","<p><strong>I am not an attorney. The following is not legal advice.</strong></p>

<p>Whether or not it's unusual isn't really relevant. What is relevant is that it is <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/own-startup-shares-know-your-rights-to-company-financials-1464082203"" rel=""nofollow"">probably illegal</a> for a company not to share certain financial data with its shareholders. Just keep in mind, the rules companies must follow will likely differ for actual shareholders and those who merely hold options.</p>

<p>A company may generally ignore your request to provide random bits of financial information as there are formal processes you must follow to obtain the information you're requesting. It's not reasonable that you should stroll into your CFOs office at any moment and expect to be told the latest number of outstanding shares. However, if you follow the correct procedures defined in law, and are prepared to take legal action if necessary, you will be able to obtain the financial information you desire.</p>

<p>Of course, companies don't need to strictly follow the law. They can be more open with their financials and can treat their shareholders well. I won't really get into what makes for good shareholder relations in this answer. However,  I will go through a few examples of laws that may apply.</p>

<p><strong>State Corporate Law</strong></p>

<p>The corporation laws of the state in which the company is incorporated are probably the best place to find rules that give you a way to get financial data. <a href=""http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc07/#220"" rel=""nofollow"">If your company, like most tech startups, is incorporated in Delaware, you have a right to review the books.</a> There is a correct process you must follow that includes submitting an affidavit that states: you are a shareholder (not just an option-holder), you have a legitimate reason for inspecting the books (such as ""valuing my shares""), and the exact documents you need (balance sheet, stockholder list, etc).</p>

<p><strong>Other Laws Governing Companies Operating in a State</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the corporate laws governing a company, some states will have additional laws that require corporations located within their borders to disclose financial information to shareholders. For example, <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1500-1512"" rel=""nofollow"">California requires many companies to provide an annual report to its shareholders</a>. The California law applies to companies headquartered within its borders who have more than 100 employees even if the company is incorporated in another state. Smaller companies can opt-out by adding a provision to their bylaws. The California law requires companies to send an annual report to shareholders 120 after a fiscal year ends, and interim reports upon requests to shareholders who own 5% or more of the company. If the company does not provide a report, the shareholder may formally request it, and a company is required to provide the report within 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Securities Law</strong></p>

<p>Federal laws that aim to protect investors making stock purchase decisions may also force a company to provide financial statements. For example, <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.701"" rel=""nofollow"">Rule 701</a> provides for disclosure of financial information by companies awarding $5 million or more in stock in any 12 month period. <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-6.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">This is the provision that got Google in trouble in 2005 when they were still a private company</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Considerations of Taking on Your Employer</strong></p>

<p>Most of these laws require you to file a lawsuit or complaint if the company does not comply with your formal request. This sort of action can have consequences on your employment status and potential within the company. To minimize these ""human risks,"" you might want to file a lawsuit with a large group of employees. This will reduce the risk of retaliation (which, even if illegal, may happen). Having a group also makes it easier to afford legal fees as everyone is chipping in a portion of the costs. A court may decide the company has to reimburse your legal fees after the process is complete.</p>

<p>Companies may also reasonably require you to sign a non-disclosure agreement and to follow other rules to keep their financial information secure. Even though you may have a right to information, you may not have the right to disclose that information to others.</p>

<p>You should consult an attorney experienced with corporate matters such as these before taking any action. Once again, I am not an attorney and nothing in this answer is legal advice.</p>

<p><strong>Share Value</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are also never told a predicted valuation. Instead, we are always told our shares should be worth $XX-$YY each.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Valuing corporate shares is a very difficult task that is indeed an art and not a science. Information a company might provide like ""predicted valuation"" is nothing more than speculation, and coming from a company it may be influenced by enormous, inherent bias. You should be extremely wary of a company telling you how much shares should be worth. If you really want to gauge the value of your shares, you (possibly with a group of cohorts) might consider hiring a qualified financial analyst to review the financial statements of your company. An experienced financial analyst should have the skills to determine a reasonable market value for your shares and should be able to advise you on the consequences of share dilution specific to the velocity of offerings at your company.</p>

<p>Also, be sure you diversify your personal investments. Employees tend to have over-sized holdings in their own companies which have abnormal impacts on overall portfolios. Make sure you are investing in other companies in a variety of industries.</p>

","<p>My answer is a bit of a non-answer, but hopefully useful to you and others who stumble along this way later.</p>

<p>You have the <em>cart before the horse</em>. It is a specialised corporate finance/valuation question when you don't have a business yet. Hopefully you have a product.</p>

<p>And if you are building the next unicorn, these decision can bite you later if you have problems or make a mistake on cofounders or investors.</p>

<p>Until then you just need to make sure you/your company owns 100% of the product and the business. </p>

<p>Don't offer someone 8% to build a front end and another VP 8% because he comes along at the right time.</p>

"When is the right time to bring investors on board","126","","<p>If I had a good idea, and I wrote a business plan, had some basic POC implemented. Is it time for me to look for investors or try to bring in the advisory board member?</p>

<p>The reason why I ask, is that people probably had good(or bad ideas thinking they're good) and went the same route, so someone knows what are the steps of creating a internet company from everything like hiring/firing to setting a milestones for your company, delegating instead of micromanaging, putting the money where it makes more money (advertising), and all that business side to the business that somebody with tech background might not think it's important but it's really driving the business forward or backward.</p>

<p>I mean having an awesome architecture and code in your app is worthless unless somebody buys into your vision of the app, which might involve people buying subscription or whatever the business model is. Even after initial success of selling your product you need to know what comes next after 12-18 months down the road, and having someone to advise you or having someone that you can talk with these things is a great asset, instead of learning everything on your own as you build your business, team etc. Also investor money helps with advertising, hiring etc.</p>

<p>So based on your experience when is the right time?  </p>
","<p>The ""right time"" is going to depend on many factors. You may also come to a point where you are more than ready to receive investment, but no investors are willing to give you one. </p>

<p>Here are some very important considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you a solo founder? Are you a technical founder? Do you have any previous startup experience? </li>
<li>How much of the company are you willing to give up to investors before exit?</li>
<li>Are you in a position to be able to self-fund the startup for any length of time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Without knowing the answer to these questions, it's impossible to even begin the discussion. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I had a good idea, and I wrote a business plan, had some basic POC implemented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is only the beginning. Unless you have a strong co-founding team with startup experience, most early stage investors are going to think your company is far too immature at this stage. A LOT of people have business plans, ideas, even prototypes. That doesn't mean there's an actual market for their startup, and even if there is, it doesn't mean that they can profitably reach it.</p>

<p>The ideal time (ESPECIALLY as a solo founder) to seek investment is when you have established some kind of measurable traction - revenues, users, pre-orders, or other forms of real engagement from your target market. Without that, you're either not going to get a deal, or you will pay dearly for the investor's increased risk. </p>

<p>You want to approach investors from a position of strength. Traction is the best way to do that.</p>

<p>If you're pre-traction, yet can point to successful startups in your space (and of course, demonstrate why you're better in some way), this can help - but an investor is still taking the risk that you can't execute.</p>

<li>20k below highest salary, .89% options, (32k options valued at $46k)</li>

<p>I'm going with .89% equity (option 3) because I met the team and saw the product and it's awesome. Also, we've signed on some big players as clients so the vision is convincing. I think there could be good potential for a buyout. So I think $20k salary loss / year would end up being nothing compared to risk of losing the .4% higher equity pkg. in the case of a large buyout.</p>

<p>Since I'm going more equity heavy in exchange for salary, I have a lot of equity questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let's say I leave after a year, so 25% of my .89% equity vests. I can leave this invested in the company and watch it grow and still exercise my right to buy at the original options price, right?</li>
<li>Same question as above, but what happens if I exercise my options when I leave? Do I get a payout of the current value of the options even if an exit hasn't yet happened?</li>
<li>What typically happens if I'm in for a year, 25% vested, and the company exits. Do my options fully vest to 100% of .89% automatically?</li>
<li>The shares should be common stock, right ?</li>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this is different than my other <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/11493/equity-vs-salary-options"">question</a> as this pertains strictly to exercising options as they vest.</p>
","<p>The answers depend on your employment contract and options agreement so you should read those documents carefully.</p>

<p>Generally, you must exercise your options while you are an employee and you can't exercise them after you leave.  The options expire when you leave employment.</p>

<p>When you exercise your options, you are buying shares of the company at the option price.  You don't get a payout.  You get a piece of paper that says you own some shares of the company.  The company may offer to buy the shares back from you but they don't have to.</p>

<p>When the company exits, the options generally expire.  For example, if the company gets acquired at 11 months, your options expire and you get nothing.  Some people are able to negotiate an acceleration clause in their employment agreements that fully vests all options in the event of an exit.  </p>

<p>We don't have any customers insofar. But that's looking to change with 3 big ($6 bill+) companies looking to buy our subscription. Since we're in HR Tech, our subscription is based on the number of employees a company has.</p>

<p>One of the companies has 70+k employees and they're looking to start with 20k employees (a few of their subsidiaries) for this year. Per Employee per month is 30 cents: revenue is approx $7.2k/year and can increase based on employees at the customer to as much as $25k/year. Another customer on a similar note can bring in 20k more in revenue.</p>

<p>Now, by the end of last year, I met a very successful sales/business development guy. We worked together on a pitch for a really big software vendor. A deal with them can open up atleast 20+ such aforementioned customers in the next 3-4 years. Of course, that also means that we have to increase our man power and other capacities. 
End of 3years, we project :
 ///Realistic  scenario: Revenue $400k | Profit -$280k(loss)
 ///Optimistic scenario: Revenue $700k | Profit -$44k(loss).
 Overall: Revenue $500k | Profit -$150k | trend +
 But if we manage upsell other products/consulting, then we start looking good on the profit front too.</p>

<p>Now, the new guy wants to pick up a stake in the company. He wants to put in $200k for a stake of 35%.<br>
 His take: Without him, the company had no value and therefore he gets the first mover advantage.</p>

<p>This I believe is too high. What are the repercussions of accepting this?
What are my arguments to counter this and lower his stake to, say, 15-20%?</p>
","<p>After discussion with Lonelymo it came to light a miss understanding between themselves and their investor as to how investment works.</p>

<p>It may be that this is the way that some people do investment, however I am yet to come across it.</p>

<p>The company had 70% of it's equity issued to the founders and had reserved 30% of it's equity unissued to be sold to investors.</p>

<p>The investor believed that in this case, if they wanted 35% of the company then they would have to buy 5% of the shares from the founders themselves which would of course incur capital gains tax, as they had sold capital.</p>

<p>In the above model there would always be a fixed number of shares which would get traded around. No one would become 'diluted' as such, just simply sell their shares until they had none and clauses in agreements around the sale of shares would be invoked all of the time. It would get messy as far as I can see.</p>

<p>what actually happens when you raise investment is that the founders keep their shares. So, in the above case Lonelyme has 35,000 shares. They will always keep this number of shares unless they buy more (or end up with some from a reserved employee pool). Instead you create new shares.</p>

<p>So, if an investor is issued with 35,000 shares then the total number of shares go up. Meaning Lonelymo still has the same number of shares but their percentage of the pot has dropped (dilution) and hopefully the value per share has increased and so lonelymo's value on paper at least has increased. No shares change hands, no capital is gained from and so no tax is incurred (until you exit the company and sell your shares).</p>

<p>This happens with every round of investment. Investment is sought, a valuation is negotiated and the number of shares is created and issued diluting everyone in the pot.</p>

<p>I threw together a quick <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WMKnwPD6DAkevcqyUCGjBYBt1CaGp0hhhgUiOTLnGmk/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noreferrer"">cap table</a> to hopefully highlight the process.</p>

<p>so my advice to lonelymo has been to issue the reserve shares (and look into the legal ramifications of doing so) so that both founders have 50% and then treat the new person as an investor in the above model issuing new shares to them diluting the two of them.</p>

"What tools and software are used to create a new social network?","125","","<p>I have an idea. It is a pretty simple idea, it something I need and I cannot find on internet, and I believe that  people around the world need it. 
That said, I can find on internet very similar web sites to the one I have in mind, but they provide different services from the one I want. </p>

<p>The social network has two different users: those who give the service (retailers) and those who use the service (customers).  Structurally, it is very similar to airbnb or uber or many many websites. It does not need (for the moment) of a mobile app or heavy data analysis, but just social networking. So, I think there are tons of software already ready to create this website. I can develop software, so I'd like to create an alpha of the website before looking for partners. <strong>What software and which kind of hosting service do I need to build such a website?</strong>
This is a preliminary list of thinks that (I guess) have to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the right hosting service (<em>Do I need of AWS-like services or a standard hosting service with php+mysql could be enough?</em>) </li>
<li>A possible way to manage suggestions can be through neo4j.</li>
<li>Manage multiple languages  (<em>is there a specific software for this?</em>). in particular I would start with my local language and English and eventually cover the most frequent languages.</li>
<li>I thought to use PayPal as the simplest way to allow customers to pay for the service, and then the website to pay the retailers.</li>
<li>what language should I use to develop the server-side website? (<em>php, node.js, ruby on rails, python?)</em> I have no idea. </li>
<li>Buy a domain</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe the smarter way to start is finding a something already developed for this kind of websites. </p>

<p><strong>Does exist a software that, like WordPress for blogs, allows to create a social-network quickly and efficiently?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Can you suggest a more effective list of TODOs?</strong></p>
","<p>Although I think it is possible to create such a network on Wordpress, I think customization would be very limited. You can use plugins like bbpress.</p>

<p>However, I think your best solution is to find some one who knows some basic Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>An alpha version of a site like this can be built in less than 24 hours Using Ruby on Rails. My To Do list would go something like: </p>

<ol>
<li>Find someone that knows/or learn Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Create a quick user flow chart to plan how users will use the site</li>
<li>From the user flow chart, create a basic Wireframe of the site to create a structure</li>
<li>Create a basic design using Bootstrap. (Just cause it is an alpha doesn't mean it has to be ugly.)</li>
<li>Create the site in Rails. Using some basic gems:

<ul>
<li>Devise Gem for User Authentication (Create user accounts)</li>
<li>CanCanCan gem for User Authorization (Create abilities for Retailers vs Customers)</li>
<li>Bootstrap &amp; Font Awesome gems (Add quick styling)</li>
<li>Stripe gem (Accepting payments)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Host your alpha for free on Heroku.com. That way you can hold off on buying a domain name and paying for hosting until you have your first beta vesion done.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

"Do we need to follow a business model?","124","","<p>When we are starting a business, do we really need to follow an existing business model?</p>

<p>And what are the advantages?</p>
","<p>The main advantage of having some kind of business plan or business model is to clarify your thoughts. Even a succinct one forces you to give a cold hard look at whether what you're doing makes thing move in the right direction or not.</p>

<p>It's not about the spreadsheet - the latter is full of made-up numbers and wishful thinking. It's more about laying bare your revenue streams and cost centers, articulating your growth strategy, planning resources to execute the latter, and so forth.</p>

<p>In this sense, think of it as a marketing document. Not in terms of ""we provide wash-machine repair services"". Rather, in terms of ""we provide wash-machine repair services to clients who a) aren't rich enough to buy a new one when theirs break, b) aren't handymen enough to repair it themselves, c) care to actually repair it instead of mopping up the leak, d) etc. We reach out to these clients by doing this and that so they're aware we exist. [And so forth.]""</p>

<p>Pin down precisely what you're selling, who you're selling it to, why they're going to be interested, how you're going to sell it, why they should be buying from you instead of your competitors, etc. And then lay out the resources you'll need to deliver. It's a short doc - a few pages at most.</p>

"How do I attract users to add content, before there is content to attract them?","124","","<p>I recently launched a website where users can review websites, online stores, webseries, webcomics, social networks, etc, and now I am trying to build the userbase. Think of it like Yelp for the Internet, a place to go when you want to find not just the first result on a search page, but the best website for what you're looking to do. </p>

<p>The problem is, without a userbase I have very little content so far, and without much content I'm having a hard time attracting a userbase.</p>

<p>The people I've shown it to seem to think it has a good chance of getting some popularity. Everyone has opinions about Facebook and Netflix and such, and I know A LOT of people looking for a good dress shopping site, or a new writing group, or the best online dating site, etc. And just like with restaurants and stores on Yelp, everyone wants to tell people about their favorite websites, and everyone wants to warn others of the terrible experiences they've had online. Many people who have seen the site have described it as one of those ""I never knew I wanted this"" ideas, so I'm (tentatively) enthusiastic about its chances.</p>

<p>But while I've added over 300 websites to the database so far with more coming every day, and we're starting to get more and more people submitting their own websites as well, we don't have nearly as many people writing reviews. I've written a bunch myself, and I'm trying to rally my friends and family as well, but obviously this is an uphill battle and a short-term patch, not a real solution. A review site lives and dies five the number and quality of reviews that its users submit. I'm experimenting with paid advertising on a number of platforms to increase the traffic, but it looks like so far people are coming to the site, looking around, murmuring ""neat"", and then leaving. And without much content to read, I can't really blame them.</p>

<p>So my question is, can anyone offer any advice for getting content up on a user-review site, before there is much pre-existing content to draw people in?</p>

<p>The website is called FlitterWeb and can be found at <a href=""http://www.FlitterWeb.com"">www.FlitterWeb.com</a>.</p>
","<p>Unless you have substantial resources, the usual answer to how to get from capability to sustainability is to find a niche where both the person searching and the person wanting to be found are both underserved.</p>

<p>That focus will let you be targeted in your efforts, and it also means that recruiting advocates and reviewers is simpler because if (say) you focus on delis in Delaware, you want to find deli-lovers in Delaware.</p>

<p>In the process, you're likely to find other, related but distinct, ways that the site owners have hassle. The old wisdom was, ignore detail unless you can see it generalises. Today's startup is more likely to want to serve passionate communities super-well, as long as there's the potential to grow.</p>

"How much of free content should i set in my game?","124","","<p>I have a game with 3 lvls: </p>

<pre><code>- 1: press 1 button
- 2: press 2 buttons
- 3: press (you guess) 3 buttons
</code></pre>

<p>lvl 1 is free, the full version which contains all lvls and ad free is 1$</p>

<p>From google analytics I know half of the users installed the game deinstalled it directly (don't know why, maybe because of the cost?). Today, I got 2 feedbacks, which said, they dislike it since you can only play 1 lvl. (I got much more positive feedback, but I want to take care of the negatives too).</p>

<p>Now, if I will set lvl 1 &amp; 2 for free, I think the users will know whats coming in lvl 3 (He will think""aah 1 button in lvl 1, 2 buttons in lvl 2, and 3 in lvl3""), and they won't buy it, because it's no more a secret as it is now. </p>

<p>But on the other side, maybe more players will keep the game because they can do more with it..?</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>
","<p>I don't know if this is a question of <strong>""how much""</strong>, but rather <strong>""why would someone want to pay you?""</strong>. </p>

<p>I remember a while back there was a game that had a free trial that was 1 level, which was a lot of fun. I really loved the game, but rather than pay for the game to get more levels I just replayed the 1st level over &amp; over &amp; over again until I got bored with the game and then found another free trial to play. It wouldn't have mattered if there was 1/2 of a level or 3 levels. I wasn't going to pay for the game with so many other free options to spend my time on.</p>

<p>Nowadays the only games that I purchase are the extremely cheap games (Doodle Jump for $1), games that are super hyped (GTA V for $60), or free-trial games that I get hooked on usually with a cliff-hanger ending to the trial (i.e. <a href=""https://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/"" rel=""nofollow"">""The Wolf Among Us""</a> which is an awesome game for $25).</p>

<p>Another type of game that I ""pay"" for are games with Ads. I don't personally give the developer money, but I'll sit through a 10 second ad to get to the next level (i.e. ""RETRY"") or to make another turn (i.e. ""Words with friends""). The developer usually gets a penny or two for every viewing, which can be quite profitable.</p>

<p>Additionally, the ""freemium"" game is very popular amongst game makers though the morality of that sort of business plan is debatable. I don't contribute to games like this, but I do play them if they're fun w/o purchasing anything.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Some suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Put together some realistic projections using other games similar to yours to see what method would net you the most given your resources.</li>
<li>If you're already committed to the free trial, then add something to give the customer a reason to keep going. Maybe they'll lose their save if they don't buy or they won't find out what happens to their beloved character.</li>
<li>If you're just looking for some spare change rather than funding your operation, then consider donations through something like <a href=""https://pledgie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pledgie</a></li>

"How to find a decent Lawyer?","124","","<p>One of main components in business is to take care of legal stuff.  </p>

<p>Options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>One of partners has this knowledge.</li>
<li>Get a lawyer to work in startup for a share.</li>
<li>Hire a lawyer and pay him.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 is obviously the best yet not as common as one would like, so most startups have to take options 2 and 3.<br>
The problem with options 2 and 3 is you have to trust someone with all your ideas who can screw you over most, someone who knows how to 'get around' things.
Thing to note 3 is going to be expensive and you still don't get any guarantees.
Problem with 2 is how to tell that lawyer is competent and can protect business properly from competitors not overbuying patents and not being to loose when you have no idea about the law yourself? Someone is going to suggest to get lawyer by recommendation from someone you know, but I have found it difficult to do personally as one needs business (not a divorce) lawyer and they are usually hard to come by.<br>
My past experience hiring lawyers over internet turned out to be disaster one lawyer turned out to only have license to deal with papers and no qualification whatsoever to represent me in court, this happened after I already signed over 10% of company shares (she had excellent track on Elance with 20+ happy clients by writing them T&amp;C and preparing contract agreements), and other that at one point suggested to appoint her a company director so she would <code>look better when talking to clients</code> and when confronted said that <code>normally she would charge £600 for that</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Where to look and how to avoid getting entangled with scammers and find good reliable lawyer?</strong></p>
","<p>You didn't mention the size of your company so I'm not even sure if you have an actual independent board or not.  If you are very small, you will need to retain 2 types of lawyers - one for daily/regular business items such as drafting contracts, writing disclaimers, etc.  The other should be a rarely used company that specializes in litigation in your industry and onyl the second needs to be an actual firm/person.  The first can be obtained through a legal website where you input what you want and a qualified lawyer will draft what you need and youy cna confirm all the details.</p>

<p>For the first, you can use <a href=""https://www.legalmatch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">LegalMatch</a>, <a href=""https://www.rocketlawyer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">RocketLawyer</a>, and <a href=""https://www.lawpivot.com/staticontent/howitworks/"" rel=""nofollow"">LawPivot</a> (actually bought out by RocketLawyer.  </p>

<p>For the second, find a list of law firms in your location with litigation experience in your specific field.  This requires some research and you can pay the firm a small retainer fee so that you can call them anytime something comes up.  When it does, they will be able to represent you and you will not have to pay prior to that.  This is helpful because you may need to respond quickly and its best to have someone you know you can call.  No lawyer that works on simple business contracts will be able to provide you with guidance on going to court, let alone actually representing you in court.

<p>Does this provide us with any benefit other than not having to establish/maintain multiple companies?</p>
","<p>The main advantage to creating an LLC with a group as small as the one you mention is to protect yourself and your co-founders from any losses the LLC might accumulate.

<p>By creating an umbrella LLC, you're tying together the finance's of your company and your wife's. You still have the degree of separation between yourself and the company, but it would try the two companies together until you decide to break them off.

Let's call that <em>total_students</em>.  I consider 2 weeks to be a ""reasonable"" amount of time for a followup session to occur.  </p>

<p>Then, count how many of those students have completed <strong>at least one</strong> additional session with the tutor between the beginning of the semester, and now.  Let's call that <em>followup_students</em>.  </p>

<p>I am thus defining the <em>2-week student retention rate</em> for a tutor as <em>followup_students</em> / <em>total_students</em>.  Thus a tutor who never gets a second session with a student will have a retention rate of 0, and a tutor who keeps them coming back will have a retention rate of 1.</p>

<p>However, there are some caveats.  Attrition can happen for a number of reasons, not just poor customer satisfaction:</p>

<ul>
<li>The student could drop the course.  This will hit harder on our tutors who tend to work with students who are struggling more.</li>
<li>The student could be a ""exam-only"" type of student.  Meaning, that they tend not to want to meet with a tutor until right before an exam, and then suddenly it's cram time.  This would make their tutors look bad between the first and second round of exams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tutors with fewer students are going to bounce around more, since one followup session will make a huge difference.</li>
<li>2 weeks is an arbitrary period of time that I just decided was ""long enough.""</li>
<li>Should I factor in the <em>number</em> of followup sessions (instead of a simple binary model)?</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, does this make sense as a way to evaluate customer retention rate, for my tutors or even for the business as a whole?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I was advised to post my question via <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/242406/where-should-i-ask-a-question-about-metrics/"">a meta-question</a>.</p>
","<p>I'm certainly not an expert in this area, but I'll take a shot at it:</p>

<p>I think you've got a good start on it and with some tweaking you'll be getting some more actionable data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attrition can happen for a number of reasons, not just poor customer
  satisfaction:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've worked with a number of companies and generally from what I've seen they all have an ""acceptable rate of attrition"". This includes turn over from an ""acceptable"" number of unhappy customers as well as those odd cases where they know a certain number of people are going to move to a different location outside your service area (for example) and there's nothing you could have done to stop it.</p>

<p>You'll need to determine what is acceptable. I would suggest a good place to start is by taking measurements of each of your tutors and see if there are any noticeable trends in those initial numbers.  (Obviously with the goal always being to become more efficient in pushing even the ""acceptable""/expected attrition rate down)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The student could drop the course. This will hit harder on our tutors
  who tend to work with students who are struggling more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have particular tutors that tend to work with these ""high-risk clients"" (assuming here you <em>know</em> they are struggling when they sign up), you may just need to classify them differently as their numbers are going to come up different than everyone else's.  This may be as simple as finding a different number for their expected rate of attrition.</p>

<p>I used to do DSL tech support in a call center and they measured us all on a dozen different metrics. One of them was whether or not the customer called back after we were done. Once I'd been there a while, they set up a special phone queue so they could send customers that had already called in 3+ times in the past week to a veteran agent.  I was one of the people receiving those calls, and at first they expected us to live up to the same metrics as everyone else. Problem is if someone has already called in 3 times, yeah there's a chance they got newbies the last couple times and I'll be able to fix their problem... but it's more likely they've already got a ticket in with the main office or are waiting on a tech to come out and all I'm going to be able to do is give them an update, try to keep them calm, and if the ticket isn't resolved by the next day they're going to call in again no matter what I said to them. </p>

<p>Giving a different set of metrics/goals to the people handling those situations solves that problem.</p>

<p>There may also be a way to classify the client differently rather than the tutor. Then the high-risk client would simply be weighted differently in your algorithm than a regular client.  If a high-risk client is twice as likely to skip out on the follow-up then it only carries half the weight against the tutor's score OR it counts twice as much for their score when they come in for a follow-up. (Adjust that for whatever % difference there actually is in likelihood of attrition)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The student could be a ""exam-only"" type of student. Meaning, that they tend not to want to meet with a tutor until right before an exam,
  and then suddenly it's cram time. This would make their tutors look
  bad between the first and second round of exams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you know when exam-time is, you can account for this as well. Anyone that has no history of seeking tutoring, and then signs up a week before exams is automatically classified as high risk and weighted differently.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tutors with fewer students are going to bounce around more, since one
  followup session will make a huge difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is probably to be expected, and I'm not sure off hand how to counter-act it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 weeks is an arbitrary period of time that I just decided was ""long
  enough.""</p>
  
  <p>Should I factor in the number of followup sessions (instead of a
  simple binary model)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubt anyone here is going to be able to give a better estimate of how long is long enough for a follow-up than you.</p>

<p>I would imagine having the number of follow-up sessions as a part of your data could be very valuable. However, I think I would keep them separate.</p>

<p>So you want to know the proportion of people coming back AND you want to know the average number of times they're coming back. Those data points are <em>related</em> but they are very <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>Another thought: You haven't mentioned it but if you have a period of high sign-ups/drop-offs at the beginning of the semester (sign-up at the beginning and then decide they don't need it or don't have time for the extra commitment), that would need to be accounted for too.  I would think it could be accounted for in a similar way.</p>

<p>Hope that all made sense! It's about 2 am here and I need to go to bed...</p>

"Where should I go to register copyrights and trademarks for my website?","123","","<p>I'm starting up a website, who, what, when, where should I go to apply for trademarks or copyrights on my website name and logo.</p>

<p>I have the domain. Isn't that enough?</p>

<p>I also have slick logo and want that not to be taken. Is there an independant copyriight law protecting my site once its live next year or do I need to pay and register. If so, where do I go to do that?</p>
","<h1>In the US:</h1>

<h1>Copyrights</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>As Alain mentioned, anything you write or create (think media such as pictures, logos, artwork, sculptures, etc) is copyrighted by default. </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you provide a copyright notice. Your work is copyrighted when you publish it, but an infringer isn't necessarily liable for any damage done to you by infringement UNTIL they are notified of the copyright (i.e. the copyright notice).</p></li>
<li><p>You also won't be able to sue an infringer until you file your work with the Library of Congress (if I remember correctly). Your work is copyrighted, but you must file before you sue. This can be done online for a modest fee, but usually isn't worth it for a website, especially a dynamic one. It is typically more useful for published books (a static work) or the like.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Trademarks</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Trademarks vs. Service Marks -- are very similar. The basic difference being that trademarks are for <strong>GOODS</strong> being sold and service marks are for <strong>SERVICES</strong> being sold.</p></li>
<li><p>Trademarks (or Service Marks) are also somewhat tricky. A trademark - even of a logo - exists by using it in a given locale but ONLY in that locale, and ONLY for the goods (or service) it is used for. These are denoted by the superscript <em>TM</em> for trademark and <em>SM</em> for service mark.
In other words - if I had a trademarked logo and sold trees using that name and logo, you could use the EXACT SAME name and logo and sell cars - it goes back to the concept of whether you would be confusing my customers and therefore doing damage to my business.</p></li>
<li><p>A trademark/service mark can be extended to cover the entire US by <strong>registering</strong> the mark with the USPTO (U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office). You can do it yourself, or use an intellectual property attorney (RECOMMENDED!). This is denoted by the ""(R)"" (circle-R) symbol.
I believe this will not override any existing default marks that have been in use and are currently being used in a given locale. Furthermore, this is a rather significant investment, and has usage requirements (i.e. something along the lines of your mark registration will expire if you aren't actually USING the mark for the goods/services within a certain amount of time or if you cease using the mark for a certain amount of time).</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Where to Go</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>A local intellectual property attorney - usually handles copyright, trademark, and patent work, unless they are a specialist.</p></li>
<li><p>USPTO website (they also have a link to pro bono help for small startups/individuals, as well as self-representation help)</p></li>
<li><p>Local inventors groups, innovation centers, startup groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Local chamber of commerce can sometimes be helpful, at least in pointing you towards help.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Random Points</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>As Alain pointed out, your primary focus is to maximize the value of your website. HOWEVER, if intellectual property issues are not thought out beforehand (like you are doing) then you can run into difficulties later that cannot be fully rectified at that date.</p></li>
<li><p>No, a domain is not enough. It is not a copyright. As Alain partially pointed out, it isn't really copyrightable. However, it can be an extension of your trademark / service mark (e.g. you could register Wal-Mart.com, but Wal-Mart could probably file with the proper agency and force it to be transferred to them, since you would be infringing their trademark).</p></li>

"Can one realistically launch a startup from home","122","","<p>I live in a place where tech startups are non-existent, thus I have no physical access to people with skills who might be willing to co-found. Can you realistically find co-founders/partners online? How successful such a path would be - when you don't have personal interactions with these people?</p>
","<h2>General thoughts</h2>

<p>I absolutely believe, that nowadays a business could be entirely run from home.
I am part of a remote-only agency and apart from a few downsides that naturally come from remote working, it's working very well.</p>

<p>For co-founders my only concern would be, that you should trust a co founder and in my opinion need to make sure, you have the same vision and balance each other out nicely.<br>
This is usually in my experience better done in person. Relationships are also usually formed on a deeper level in person.</p>

<p>That being said, this not only makes finding a co-founder harder but also forming business relationships.</p>

<p>I do think it's possible, but I believe, a lot of people will tend to be a little ""old-fashioned"" about this still. So I would assume it's harder to co-found remotely.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT regarding your comment:</strong></p>

<h2>Ressources</h2>

<p>I cannot quote any resources directly.<br>
We try a lot as we go and usually don't spend much time on researching ways to change things.  </p>

<p>One thing you could check out is the <a href=""https://open.buffer.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=nav-open"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Buffer Open blog</a>.<br>
They have very big parts of their team work remotely, so they often cover how they do it and what works for them.</p>

<p>I try to just write down all the things that come to my mind that we found with a smaller team (3 core workers, remote clients and sometimes external workers).</p>

<h2>Obviously timezones are an issue</h2>

<p>We deal with 6-7 hours difference in our core team, which is manageable. If it's too far off, someone is obviously having to suffer from having to be up too early or late. So trying to keep the TZ difference as small as positive might turn out to be a plus.  </p>

<h2>""Water cooler communication"" comes very short</h2>

<p>Usually when you have an office, you also chat about private stuff or have some casual conversations about work in your break time or at lunch.  </p>

<p>We don't have that at all. Or at least it doesn't occur as naturally as you would have it if you'd share an office or even a desk.  </p>

<p>We found that if you only communicate through tools like Slack, Trello, Email or occasional calls, the work relationship starts to suffer and you tend to drift apart in terms of work flows, even tech stack and many other things. So we try to over-communicate. This doesn't always work and it can be annoying at times, because it might be a distraction when someone constantly posts seemingly useless stuff into slack.<br>
But the benefits outweigh the downsides. Often this also means sharing ideas, sharing concerns and talking about small problems before they become big problems.<br>
Also it's very hard to spot if someone under-communicates and needs some encouragement or if that person is just better when working more quietly.  </p>

<p>So always try and evaluate.</p>

<h2>Meetings are still necessary</h2>

<p>What we do to counter the negative effects a little bit is, we try to meet up in person at least once a year.  </p>

<p>Getting together in person really resets us and brings up a big vibe of motivation and creativity. We do workshops together, we discuss future plans for the company together or we just get some beer and talk about life.</p>

<p>Now as I said, we have a 3 person team and even there, we still sometimes hesitate because it can become rather expensive if you book flights around the world plus hotel and everything for a few people. But we know it doesn't work without it and if we could, we would do it more often. </p>

<h2>Vibe is ""more important"" than skill</h2>

<p>Another thing we believe in is that when hiring for remote only teams you should probably prefer people you have a connection with and that you can trust more easily, than those who are perfect for the job.  </p>

<p>That doesn't mean, that you should hire good buddies <strong>without</strong> skill over experienced people, but again you need to get the balance right.</p>

<p>Rather put some time into teaching them the last 20% they need to do the job than have someone who is best at ones craft and doesn't get along with you.</p>

<p>Skill you can teach, getting along with someone not so much. </p>

<p>This isn't only important when meeting in person, but also because remote working is all about trust. You need to trust the other person, that they'll do their work properly and drive the company in the same way as you. So taking a slice off their skill level and therefore having more company loyalty and deeper relationship is making up for lack of skill.</p>

<p>So that would be it for our personal point of view. If I can think of more like this, I might be adding to the list. Hope this helps.</p>

Seems obvious, but a statement like ""ultimately a risk no matter what"" leads me to believe you might be discounting the value of basic research.  For example, just because the product only requires a one percent conversion rate of the households within one mile of the final distribution point, that does not mean that would in fact be the demand for it; meaning that at some point, no matter how marginal your sample size, if the response was positive, the likelihood that you'd deviate so significantly to reach the minimum response rate of one percent would be worth the risk.</p>

<p>To be clear, I would essentially show them potential security breaches in their web site, and offer to help them fix it. I have already looked extensively into legal issues, and have multiple levels of tests. The initial test is simple, and can be done legally, then I would show them results, and offer to do some deeper testing, and help them to overcome the potential security breaches. </p>

<p>I pretty much have the technical side down, I just need to know where to start. I thought about doing this test on various sites, and emailing the owners, but I feel like they would see that as spam. Any ideas on how to appear professional while soliciting a service?</p>
","<p>Your basic idea is a good one.

<p>(Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying, ""don't get out there and sell."" But selling isn't your forte, so you need to tilt the field in your favor.

","<p>Within the classic C corporation they can have voting and non-voting shares. You can establish something similar in the by-laws of your LLC.</p>

"Is it waste of time invest in some domain that already has apps?","122","","<p>Lately I've seem much emphasis on the development of cloud applications with several clients (web desktop, mobile, etc) and that can even in some more sophisticated cases interface with another devices in order to control them (the internet of things). I've been preparing to build one of these, but it gets complicated to select which app to build.</p>

<p>The problem is, many of the ideas I thought about, I go google about it, and there is already at least one app to achieve that goal I had in mind and this makes life really complicated. </p>

<p>One of the examples I searched, there were in my country 550 thousand companies of the segment that could be potential customers of the app, and in my city there were 1500 companies. In that case, selling for 500 which I think is already a big number, but it still represents just 0,09% of the national market share and 0,27% of the city market share. Those are small numbers from my point of view.</p>

<p>So my question is: if I have the idea to develop some app to accomplish some goal, is it <strong>always</strong> a waste of time when there are another apps lurking around or in cases where there are tons of customers available, like the numbers I gave, it becomes possible to have success even though there are already apps in place?</p>

<p>My point of view is that since there is some app already, I'll have a hard time with marketing. The reason is because the app will have less impact, since it won't be something new for the customers. Is that right?</p>

The business world isn't like the contemporary art world, where originality is the only form of merit (and even in art, something done <em>well</em> is better than something done first).</p>

<p>If your app is appreciably different/superior to the ones that already exist, then it's worth it. Can you justify to yourself, your investors, and your customers, that your app solves problems better than the competitor, or solves more nuanced problems, or solves problems in a new way? If so, go for it.</p>

<p>Use the work your competitors have done <em>to your advantage</em>. They've already broken in the idea, found out some of it's strengths and weaknesses, and they've likely already invested in their particular strategy or market. You have the freedom to benefit from what they've done. Just do your research and understand what exactly you're up against.</p>

<p>It sounds usurious. Also, you need to put equity into a company when you create it in most places. (Admittedly, some countries turn a blind eye when you say the initial capital is [<em>cough</em>] ""in the cash register"" but you're playing with fire if you do that and the US is not one of those countries.)</p>

<p>It doesn't. The whole point of having a limited liability company is so the company's owners aren't on the hook for the company's debts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What kind of sensible agreement could they reach?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same any defaulted company loan goes through. You liquidate the company's assets, and then return the money to creditors in order of seniority. This usually means paying the taxman first, unpaid salaries next, then outstanding debts, with shareholders keeping the balance. If money runs out during that process, then tough luck.</p>

"How can I attract young workers for my family-run restaurant?","121","","<p>I have a small restaurant that has been in my family for a while, but I've started to lose some of my workers to larger companies who are able to, frankly, pay them more.</p>

<p>To be clear, yes, I would love to pay my employees more. And I have every intention of doing so later down the road, but right now business has just been slow. It's barely making enough for me to get by.</p>

<p>I live in Seattle, where we've recently <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/02/news/economy/seattle-minimum-wage/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bumped the minimum wage up at $15</a>. For those unaware, here's a quote from that article.</p>

<p>I'm strictly <em>not</em> looking for a political discussion on this, but rather, I'm just trying to come up with how I plan to handle it.</p>

<p>How can I attract young people looking for summer jobs to come work for my restaurant when I can't pay the same amount as they'd get from other, bigger companies?</p>

<p>The quick answer for <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/q/45/59"">related questions</a> on here is often ""give them equity,"" but I don't think that's quite as relevant in a business like this.</p>
","<p>According to many experts, baseline happiness has two big drivers: <strong>Do I know what my job is?</strong> and <strong>Do I have the tools to do my job?</strong> Everything else - pay included - comes below those.</p>

<p>So your first challenge is to get that right. The bad news is that most large chains are pretty good on this, but lots of small restaurants aren't, so you have an opportunity to position yourself in the upper group.</p>

<p>Get those right, and you can add in something that chains struggle with, which is to give people a great way to answer <strong>How can I and my co-workers see the difference my contribution makes?</strong> Work on your welcome, catch people doing things right and give praise in public, make sure different roles aren't seen as giving people different value or status, share daily and weekly stats, give treats on birthdays and anniversaries (30 nights worked etc) and basically create a place you'd love to work whether for an odd night or long term.</p>

<p>Some people are still going to focus on the hourly rate. You'll lose them. But if you create an awesome working culture, be generous when you can afford it, and be creative in making your restaurant a fun and friendly place to work, loyal staff who value those features will bring in other people like themselves. </p>

"When does a startup need a brand?","121","","<p>You can often see startups spending massive amounts of time on branding, or conversely no time at all. Clearly, some aspects to the development of a brand depend on the nature of the startup, but it seems like there should be a way to manage the timing and development of a brand relative to the demands of a venture. When does a startup need a brand?</p>
","<p>I'll take a completely contradictory opinion. With reasons. If you're following lean startup, you'll have discovered how to get repeat engagements with people who want to buy, using the Customer Development process.</p>

<p>This will tell you what the salient components of your offering are. If you service a sufficiently important need, you don't need a snazzy logo, fancy name and slick stuff. If your audience values, above all, what your website looks like, and not what you do... You should be looking at being in the publishing industry and give up on the product or service you're selling.</p>

<p>In the end, what counts, is conversions. If you don't sell, then whatever animal you're like, whatever colour represents you, whatever sounds emphasise your intrinsic qualities, whichever swoosh you've used, the font you've selected... is just wasted time, effort and money.</p>

<p>Branding follows the audience, in a startup. Find your customer. Build what they need. Be identifiable because of what you do for them, not because you have a sweepier swoosh in a distinctive Pantone colour using an unreadable custom font. :)</p>

<p>Your brand is your promise to deliver value. You're not big enough, important enough, yet, to be family. That may come. And at that point you'll have the need and the money to re-brand, get a snaky logo, put up unreadable font websites in pale grey on silver, and survive the experience.</p>

<p>Brand is an experience, not a colour, not a font, not a look. Give good experience.</p>

"How much does it cost to obtain a seed round?","120","","<p>Meetings with investors, legal costs, opportunity cost and everything else.</p>

<p>From what I hear it takes months of full time work just finding investors who are serious. The opportunity cost of two founders meeting with many investors until they find a serious offer is as high as 400k, if you assume they could have instead worked high paying technical jobs full time. Plus all the anciliary legal costs.</p>

<p>Given that seed rounds are as low as 500k, it seems that the funding you get is actually pretty marginal compared to the time you invest, at least for the seed round. </p>

<p>Is this accurate? Is this what keeps just anyone from starting a tech company? </p>
","<p>Yes. You pretty much have that correct.</p>

<p>However, I would say this... I would change the last sentence of your question from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this what keeps just anyone from starting a tech company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is one reason why successful tech startups are rare and also why you hardly find tech companies in which the founder or at least one of the co-founders was also the lone developer of at least a fully functioning prototype.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But... you also left out one important fact. Which explains why any of this ever happens at all.</p>

<h3>So, why does any startup ever get funded?</h3>

<p>Typically, <em>funded</em> tech startups are <em>valued</em> around $3 million (pre-money) at early seed stage.</p>

<p>Meaning if an investor invests $500k they might accept significantly less than 20% of the company. And the funded amount gets added to the pre-money valuation to determine the post-money valuation. So, in this example, the post-money valuation would be $3.5 million and the two co-founder's share-of-value would be $3 million... a $2.6 million (unrealized) gain on their $400k investment.</p>

<p>FWIW, another milestone/benchmark combination is <strong><em>first dollar of revenue</em></strong>. If a startup reaches that milestone, today, valuations are going in the neighborhood of $25 million. At least in tech valley.</p>

<p>If you think about it, it makes sense that early stage funding would barely cover founders costs. This is because it is in the investors' interest to keep the founders hungry at this early, critical stage. Hungry = working and motivated. Not <em>flush with cash</em> and <em>ready to spend</em>. Also, early stage startups are inherently risky. Most fail. So limiting early funding is also a way to mitigate investor risk.</p>

"How to deal with family members who are shareholders in my startup","120","","<p>I run a small company which offers a portal site for hometeaching teachers.</p>

<p>After reviewing our accounting books for October, it is clear to me that we will continue to lose money for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>My parents are the primary shareholders in the company, and we don't share the same attitude about the operation. I feel that this company is too overstaffed, in the relationship with the amount of sales, but my mother thinks our staff are making great efforts, so we need to keep them around and get through our financial troubles together.</p>

<p>She does not understand the accounting, so she is surprised about the financial predicament I found in looking through our books.</p>

<p>It looks to me like she is so determined to protect the staff, that she may run the business into the ground.</p>

<p>Am I evil for wanting to fire some of the staff so that some members can be saved? How valuable is being loyal to employees that may not have a positive ROI? Furthermore, how can I have this conversation with my mother in a productive way?</p>
","<p>I'm going to be a bit British and classical here, and not talk about burn rate...</p>

<p>When you closed the book I presume you are talking about a profit and loss account. Being profitable is nice, but it is important to understand that profit is not the same as cash flow.</p>

<p>Do you have a cash flow forecast? I would always have a 3 month detailed cash flow forecast and a longer term high level one. Do you have a point in the future where you forecast your cash flow to be positive? If you don't you will run out of money and your business will be insolvent (whether or not it was profitable).</p>

<p>Talk to your mum about this cashflow forecast. It is much easier to talk about than a profit and loss account (no depreciation for instance, no accruals, no prepayments). If you are not making enough cash to make the payroll you need to ask yourself why not and when this may change. Focus on cashflow, everyone understands money in the bank, profits will look after themselves. </p>

<p>One more thing to understand, having a positive cashflow in 5 years is not as good as having one now because £1000 in 5 years is worth less than £1000 now. This is known as the 'time value of money'. It is really important that you can see a return in a sensible time frame. However if that also means running a big sales team to get it, then so be it, these are the balances you have to strike in business. You can only strike those balances if you are informed and you will get that from a cashflow forecast, not from a montly P&amp;L </p>

"How to successfully woo new customers with a partly free mobile app?","120","","<p>My company wants to get a new mobile application and asked me to think about how to woo customers with such an application.</p>

<p>There are plenty of apps out there giving you the opportunity to just use a certain part of it, as long as you did not buy the whole content.</p>

<p>As I have not done something like this ever before, I would need some kind of guide on <strong>which part to give for free</strong> and <strong>which part to pay for</strong>. (Maybe a strategie guide?)</p>

<p>Thank you for your effort</p>

<p>ps: It's about an industrial app, so I do not want a ""buy ad-free version""</p>
","<p>This is something that you should try to be a lean as possible about.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to test if customers will actually find value in the full (paid) product. Talk to dozens of potential customers and see if it solves a problem that they think is a big deal for them. If they are excited then it is time to start building.</p>

<p>Your main question however was...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""which part to give for free and which part to pay for""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not something that anyone can tell you without great detail about your product, and even then it is all guess work. That's the point, though, anything you do now is only a guess, those <em>guesses need to be validated</em>. The best way to do this is to guess which features can be in the free version and will still provide enough value to hook some customers.</p>

<p>The things you may want to keep in mind are...</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating enough value to hook customers.</li>
<li>Allowing the customer to get a good feel (from the free app) of what additional value they could gain by buying the paid version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, once your best guess is built, launch it as a small beta. Track what your customers are doing and saying (quantitative and qualitative data) and then use this to make the decision if this free version is good enough or if it needs to be changed (refined or expanded).</p>

<p>One critical piece of advice is this. Once you officially launch the app, <strong>NEVER</strong> take features away from free users! This can cause your ratings and customer relations to plummet overnight. You can always give free users something new but if you take one feature away they will feel violated (even if they paid nothing for the app).</p>

"Selling service to your own employer?","120","","<p>1.5 years ago I started to work on my own project. Statistically, chances are better if you are in the heart of the industry, so I accepted an offer from one mid-sized startup (~ 1B private company) and moved to the the bay area (USA). Before moving to the US I did somewhat related work for a year as a contractor for a highly successful startup in Europe (this startup was valued around 200M in 3-4 years). Overall my professional experience is around 15 years in telecom/c++.</p>

<p>Once I described my personal project to the company owner/CEO and he asked me if I could do something similar to our company where I work as the company appears to be a heavy user of very similar services. I asked how much we spend on that and if I can know details and who to speak to and I was told that I can ask details from certain VPs (company spends over $200K/month, this number approximately doubles each year). It was obviously informal chat and this isn't exactly the same as my startup project that I'm working on, though it's closely related. I said I'll see if I can apply my ideas.</p>

<p>Since that day I refocused my idea to better suit the company that I work for. I increased pace of my own project: I hired two people to help me with side projects (like dashboard website with stats etc), basically right after finishing a day at the office I go home and work a few hours on my own project + weekends.</p>

<p>The company uses top 5 providers simultaneously in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IAAS</a> field and now I'm looking for a way to join and become 6th provider. I identified a use case that wouldn't require big changes and would instantly provide measurable product improvement. While working on this project I also identified and developed custom solutions that will cut the total monthly bill at least by half (e.g. over 100K/month). These ideas not only save money, they should also make product much better overall and these improvements might actually be more important that the monetary savings. When fully implemented my solution would become more PAAS than IAAS. </p>

<p>One-person companies have no chance to become service providers of this company for way less important/critical services and I know about cases where such companies were reject for simply being too small.
My selling points are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Technical excellence. I work for this company for almost a year. Not only I delivered what I was assigned, I did side projects on my own that boosted overall productivity of developers and CEO personally thanked me for doing that (I was actually surprised that he was aware that I was doing that side project).</p></li>
<li><p>In that startup in Europe I was doing pilots with high-risk clients. Basically, I was doing exactly what I want to do now: launch a pilot with a customer that's not sure, but no matter what there must not be any service disruption.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm insider to the company (which might as well be an obstacle because of possible conflict of interests). To make it clear, as an employee I do totally different unrelated stuff at the company (C++ and 3D graphics, while my personal project is about networking and servers).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Points for rejecting my startup service company:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Potential conflict of interests as already mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is launched they might be concerned that I'll stop working for them as an employee and will be working instead on my startup to provide them with that service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll have a one on one meeting with a decision maker at the company and I'll try to present my ideas and discuss possibility to launch a pilot. I know that guy is very good technically but I don't know him personally (unlike CEO, but I decided not to go to CEO directly, even though if I were in his shoes I'd flip from such findings and potential benefits). However, these improvements (that save 100K/month) are double without my service that I'm building with intention to provide to them. If I fully describe what exactly I did they will be able to implement that on their own.</p>

<p>So, any pointers where my proposition might be weak? Any suggestions on how to approach that kind of conversation? What kind of answers should I be prepared to give?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I had a conversation with CPO and my ideas/plans were well-received. They are ok if I do a pilot project and it's clear from the start that I do that as an independent service provider (and if I can do better then existing ones then they will buy from me instead).</p>
","<p>It is always tricky when you are an employee trying to sell to your existing company. I would look into Intellectual Property rights that you have in your contract. It could be argued that the company already own some or all of what you have been working on.</p>

<p>I have personally developed a service whist working somewhere that became my first client. I took employment in a completely different sector (no conflict of interest in working for them or a competitor).</p>

<p>Had I approached them as an employee it would have gone no where. But maybe the CEO where you work is different. After you have a good position on the IP. I can think of 3 options.</p>

<p>1) Leave their employment once the piece is ready and offer it to them upon your departure.</p>

<p>2) Go straight to the CEO and say I have personally developed this, it will save you X, however, I have done this in my own time and want to sell this through your company. You would want XX% of sales (don't go for profit - go for sale value). </p>

<p>3) Go straight to the CEO and say that you love working there, but you have developed something really cool and that would really help them. You want them to have the first use of this and will get a substantial discount to be the first adopter. The CEO may ask about your long-term plans (it takes off and you leave) so have a think about this first.</p>

<p>Make sure that you have someone you respect validate what you have done before you go for it (always good to get a perspective before you risk all your income).</p>

<p><strong>Existing Market</strong></p>

<p>An existing market is just like it sounds — it has customers, competitors, there are products serving the market and you can measure the size of the opportunity (number of current customers, total revenue, growth rate, etc.) You win in an existing market when you are better or faster on metrics that customers have told you are the basis of competition. You use a Customer Development process to get out the building and talk to existing customers of incumbents’ products.</p>

<p>They will tell you:</p>

<p>– what the basis of competition is (speed, convenience, performance, price, etc.)
– how satisfied they are with the current incumbents
– what it would take to get their business</p>

<p>You gauge demand in an existing market by whether customers have told you that they will switch, the cost they have told you it will take to acquire them and the amount of capital you can spend to do so.</p>

<p>Positives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big market size</li>
<li>Cost of entry lower</li>
<li>Know you positioning on the market</li>
<li>Faster sales cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of competition</li>
<li>Most of the great ideas are done</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Market</strong> </p>

<p>A new market is just like it sounds — it has no customers, no competitors, there are no products currently serving the market and you cannot measure the size of the opportunity. (There’s no way to measure the number of current customers, total revenue, growth rate, etc.) Most importantly for startups in a new market: Getting out of the building and asking customers what they want is futile. You’re the visionary, not them. But this doesn’t mean you get to sit inside your building and spend years building your product without talking to people. What you ask them is just radically different than in an existing or resegemented market. Getting out of the building and talking to future customers is essential. Your goal is to understand:</p>

<p>– the day in the life of the customer today
– the day in the life of the customer after your product arrives
– what other changes need to happen (cultural, buying habitats, technology shifts, economic, etc.) to make your business succeed</p>

<p>Would it be a good decision for me to enter into a brand new market. Is it better to begin with a market that is more established for a first time start up? What are the positive and negatives?</p>

<p>Positives:</p>

<ul>
<li>No or minimal competition</li>

"How to successfully achieve a transition from a group of friends to a company?","119","","<p>I'm currently an IT student and I'm creating a company with other students of my university.</p>

<p>We have known each others from the start of our studies (which we are about to complete) and since the beginning we are friends.</p>

<p>When I had the idea for the company, they decided to follow me.</p>

<p>The trouble is that recently they posted things on a chat we use for work which would be ok on a personal chat but not on a profesional one.</p>

<p>We now are coworkers as well as friends prior to the creation of the project, and even though I believe they are professionals I want to be sure that this transition from friends to coworkers happen in the best conditions.</p>

<p>How can I make this transition in the smoothest yet effective way?</p>
","<p>I don't see anything wrong with being personal friends at work. Myself, my co founder and our team chatted about everything and anything during office hours. Both face to face and on internal comms.</p>

<p>I feel it made us a better team because the work was not about the work but instead the improvement of the lives of all of us. Work was a means to achieve that so we all worked hard.</p>

<p>One thing that helps is having different channels of communication for different things. We used Slack, this let us have separate channels for different conversations.</p>

<p>General chat was for everything non work related, then we had channels for different business areas (sales, marketing, development etc)</p>

<p>It allowed us to keep noise on topics to a minimum and not lose specific thinking around things cos it was segmented. Whilst still allowing us all to be friends.</p>

<p>The culture of your business will depend on what you want it to be (collectively). If you want it silent and everyone focused then everyone has to be on board else people won't enjoy it, become unmotivated. I think the main thing to consider is if things are getting done.</p>

<p>If work is getting done and you're enjoying it then that's great. If it's not getting done then it needs addressing - and since you're friends, probably addressing carefully, in keeping with the group's current dynamic.</p>

"When to register an LLC","119","","<p>I would like to start a new business, but I'm currently not making any money yet (I haven't even started producing anything). I've already decided on a name, registered a web domain, and think that I should register it as a business now before someone else does. Eventually, I think it would make sense to do an LLC (it'll be a sole-proprietorship, I think). However, should I just register as a DBA for now wait to register LLC until I have a product I can role out? I don't know when I'll have my product ready (probably a few months to a year). I don't want to incur too much expenses until I have something to ship.</p>

<p>Would you suggest registering LLC right away, doing DBA and turning it into LLC later, or just waiting to register anything until my product is finished? Ideally I'd like to start advertising for my product before it's fully ready under the business' new name, but I'm not sure if I need to have everything registered before then.</p>

<p>Also, in case it matters, I'm not currently planning on taking out any loans or looking for investors. I'll try to bootstrap.</p>

<p>As far as laws go, I live in The United States (Iowa).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>A rule of thumb when considering filing as an LLC is the following question: as of today, what could others sue you for?</p>

<p>If the answer is ""nothing,"" don't bother filing (yet). However, as soon as you begin making money, or even writing off expenses on your tax returns, filing for an LLC (which also protects your personal belongings from the IRS in case your tax return goes awfully wrong) is strongly encouraged. </p>

<p>I noticed this line in your question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've already decided on a name, registered a web domain, and think that I should register it as a business now before someone else does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Filing for an LLC shouldn't be your priority- filing for a trademark should, though. You did the right thing in getting the domain name first (even before the trademark). Now file for a trademark, and others would have a very hard time trying to take your name. </p>

<p>An LLC doesn't protect your ownership of the name. It just protects your personal property (i.e., house, money, etc.) from not being taken should you be on the losing end of a civil lawsuit. </p>

"Can someone explain what is MFN in Y Combinator safe?","118","","<p>I'm about to raise money for my startup and I'm planning to use SAFE document.</p>

<p>It seems like there are 4 types of SAFE available in <a href=""https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Safe: Cap, no Discount</li>
<li>Safe: Discount, no Cap</li>

<li>Safe: MFN, no Cap, no Discount</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm interested in the 4th version. <code>Safe: MFN, no Cap, no Discount</code></p>

<p>Can someone explain what is MFN in layman terms?</p>

<p>From my understanding 3rd version is best for Investors and the 4th version is best for Founders. Is that correct? </p>
","<p>I have no experience personally with MFN, however it means that the current agreement will have no cap or discount. If you issue a future SAFE agreement with any of the other types 1 to 3 to later investors then the SAFE MFN will be amended to include the most favourable terms.</p>

<p>So the SAFE MFN is ensuring that anyone who puts their money in early and is therefore taking a a larger risk does not get a worse deal that someone who negotiates late.</p>

<p>3 is obviously good for the investors as they get both cap and discount. </p>

<p>4 gives the potential for no one having a cap or discount as long as everyone agrees.</p>

<p>But what is best for the investor and founder wont just depend on the price of the round. Who the investors are and what they bring to the table that will add value beyond money is often worth a cap and a discount.</p>

"Founder will not tell anyone number of shares outstanding","118","","<p>This is somewhat embarrassing. I joined a startup in the US, and the founder will not tell me or anyone the number of shares outstanding. I accepted an offer for a certain number of shares, but I have no idea if my shares are 10% of the company or 0.000001% of the company. I haven't left my full-time job so I can just quit. I looked up the company on the state entity search, and the number of shares must have been increased. It is a C-corp. As an owner of the company do, I have a right to know the number of shares (even though they aren't vested) or see the shareholders agreement?</p>
","<p>If the number of shares have been increased and you haven't been notified, it's a pretty good sign you've been diluted down.  (This is just a 10,000 foot assessment based on very limited info.)</p>

<p>If there's a shareholder agreement or corporate bylaws, you should definitely review those docuents. (In terms of financial data, there might be a clause that denies you certain rights or information, but in general, corporations have a duty to disclose financial information.) </p>

<p>The downside is, if the founder is uncooperative, your only recourse would be to to take him to court.  This course of action is known as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_suit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">derivative suit</a> and is actually fairly common. </p>

"I have vested shares without a formal contract and have just quit, are they still mine?","118","","<p>I've seen a million and one questions like this, but none that are close enough to my situation to be useful to me.</p>

<p>I worked for a startup for  1 and a half years. I was granted equity upon starting of 100k shares with a 3 year vesting period and 1 year cliff. 1/3 vested after 1 year, with monthly increments on top.</p>

<p>Today I handed in my resignation, so I'm wondering if those shares are still mine (I obviously feel they should be, since they represent a reward for effort already made).</p>

<p>The main wrinkle is this; there was never any signed contract for the equity. It was all confirmed via email, sent via the COO and acknowledged via the CEO. The CEO later responded to the same email chain when I'd asked for clarification, again confirming 100k shares.</p>

<p>The email simply referred to them as shares, not share options. It mentioned no buy back facility, no additional clauses, just the vesting schedule, total amount and when the vesting period began. It also didn't mention any strike price, but given that they called them shares rather than options, I would assume there'd be no strike price anyway.</p>

<p>So... are these shares mine? Can I actually do anything with them? Do I need someone to sign something over to me officially (or more officially than an email chain), or am I screwed?</p>

<p>Any advice greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, these kinds of situations are very fact specific, so no one can answer this without looking at the precise wording of the emails.</p>

<p>You would have been in a much better position had you tried to resolve this while you were still an employee.  At least then, the CEO would have had incentive to keep you happy.  Now, he doesn't seem to have much incentive at all so I suspect it will be challenging to resolve this.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to be as nice and diplomatic as possible and see if they will grant you the shares.  You need a stock certificate to own the shares and the company will have to do that paperwork.</p>

<p>If they don't, then you'll need a lawyer and that may cost more than the shares are worth...</p>

"client needs a proposal?","116","","<p>I'm running a SaaS that mines data from video files.
I spoke to a client who wants it. However, it requires some improvements to the product that will take development efforts about 3~4 weeks.</p>

<p>I say, if you commit for a year, we'll do it for free.</p>

<p>Prospect agrees and asks for a proposal of what we talked about on the phone...</p>

<p>Now this is where I am lost. What the hell is a proposal? What do I write in it. Is there a sample template I use for SaaS?</p>

<p>Even more worrisome, what if I'm end up having to do so much more work than what was anticipated?</p>

<p>Maybe there's a way to get my foot in the door and raise prices or be able to change it in case I end up losing money?</p>

<p>All this is very new to me, please help!</p>
","<p>Congratulations on getting your first RFP (Request for Proposal)! If you're an enterprise SaaS you can be sure it won't be the last. First of all, the Proposal may, or may not, have formal contractual terms outlined in it. Or, it may reference a separate an SOW (Statement of Work)... which can serve as a contract. But don't be surprised if you submit your Proposal and their corporate attorney turns the terms contained therein into a nice legally enforceable contract. </p>

<p><strong>You have not won the deal yet, that is probably your first priority</strong>
The deal isn't done until the ink is on the paper. Actually, in the world of startups, your confidence level shouldn't get too high until you've actually cashed the down payment check you're going to ask for when you submit your proposal. So you need to focus in on winning this opportunity, even more so if you have another startup competitor trying to win the same deal. </p>

<p>Denis de Bernardy offers excellent insight and guidance. I would add that buyers buy enterprise software because they: 1) have a real serious problem that they need fixed, 2) believe that your solution can cost-effectively and/or uniquely solve this problem, and 3) like you and believe you will do a good job with the project delivery.</p>

<p>Here are some things enterprise software buyers don't like: 1) looking bad in front of their bosses or peers from another IT project gone wrong, 2) the problem they've invited you in to discuss, 3) the sales guy they feel like has been b.s.'ing them since minute one, 4) you going out of business because you didn't have enough money to properly deliver or fund your operations. </p>

<p>My experience at this stage in the process is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dive deeper into the pain your prospect is experiencing. How many people are involved? How much money does this cost them? How is it impacting them competitively. </li>
<li>Shift into ""Trusted Advisor"" mode asap. Your job is to make your prospect successful. Your prospect needs to hear things like ""tell me what will make this a successful project for you?"" and ""where in your organization do you feel the pressure on this one is coming from"" and ""what can I provide to you that will help you better position this project internally?"" </li>
<li>At this stage it is very difficult to figure out how much pain and money this is costing your prospect. It sounds like you're far off from knowing what to charge. So focus on the intangibles above and building that relationship, then charge a price that gets you to the next milestone of your business. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Proposals often have multiple readers</strong>
I use my proposals to clearly articulate the entire landscape of the problem and the approach we will take to solve that problem (inclusive of the product), and to provide my client with a document he or she is going to be <strong>proud</strong> to share with his/her bosses and peers. ""Boom, look at this... you know that problem... I found the person to solve it."" Because then you can charge the price that gets the job done right, and helps you build your business. Your prospect might need this proposal to walk it around the office and get buy in. So find out who needs to review it and write it with those needs in mine. </p>

<p>Components I like to include in a Proposal (not all apply to you, but pick and choose):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Introductory Letter</strong> (hi, thank you, we're excited, we heard this problem, we can solve it, please ask questions as they arise)</li>
<li><strong>About us</strong> (team, experience, business history)</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong> (what we heard, key issues, your requirements)</li>
<li><strong>Our Approach</strong> (our product, how we will deliver)</li>
<li><strong>Delivery</strong> (timing, clients participation/requirements)</li>
<li><strong>Project Fees</strong> (licensing, professional services)</li>
<li><strong>Terms &amp; Assumptions</strong> (high level contractual terms, assumptions (this by the way is a good place to can identify their responsibilities to protect yourself, delivery is a two-way street)</li>
<li>Summary (short paragraph that sounds nice)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've properly qualified your prospects pain, and built a good relationship where you're moving towards a trusted status, a proposal that covers this ground rarely loses in my experience, and price matters much less. </p>

<p><strong>Contractual terms in your Proposal, attached SOW or a contract they generate for you</strong>
Protect if possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cap users, usage, feature sets... anything you can upsell later. When they need more, that is when you will really start making money from the deal and getting paid for the value you are delivering... not the price it cost you to build it. You want to charge for the next module, the full build out of the suite, etc</li>
<li>Ownership of IP (Intellectual Property)... you own your code, period. This is dangerous territory so be careful on this one. </li>
<li>Ownership of Data... they may own all of the data they enter into the system, they may own only part, they may own none. Be wise here.</li>
<li>Termination periods. Too often I see startups stuck with deals they want to cancel (i.e., they want to fire their client), only to find out they have to give six, twelve or 36 months notice (I've seen it!). Think about how badly that would suck. Don't let these terms get excessive, their corporate attorney will know he/she is being a jerk and will back off. </li>
<li>Exclusivity. They may want you to not do business with their competitors, forever, or for a really long period of time. You can't have that. </li>
</ul>

<p>Don't worry about: 
 - Exclusivity. If they want you to avoid working with a list of N number of their competitors for &lt;12 or &lt;18 months... that's probably ok. Given you're in a garage anyhow it's probably worth taking the deal. It will take you six months to get them up and running at best, probably longer. Get the deal off the ground and then in six months or so start shopping the product to their competitors. 12 months and 1 day later you can start closing new deals. People freak out about exclusivity and in enterprise game it often doesn't make sense. Get the deal and milk the cow. 
 - Features you don't have, that they will pay you to develop. Be transparent about what you have and don't have. If they're still cool with you, then you're golden. Customer fund your product development all day long... just be transparent always almost to an extreme.</p>

<p>If this is a silly question, please tell me, I might be over thinking this one.</p>
","<p>Yes, that would be a conflict of interest if any contract or agreement you make or have made with company A or B prohibit this. This can be partnership agreements, founders agreements, bylaws or employee contracts. There is no problem if the contracts permit it. After that, you should check if your partner is okay with it. He might feel like you are jumping ship if you leave him to do the work and you are elsewhere. </p>

<p>You should also check if the employee contract / bylaws of company B permit employees from working in other companies and or being connected to a customer. Some companies have clauses that prohibit this. If this is prohibited and you do not disclose it, you would be in breach of the contract and they could terminate you.</p>

"Can startups survive only from grant (or other type of public/private funding calls) applications?","115","","<p>This question corresponds to both the academia and startup/company worlds.

<p>Should I add anything else, and what is the most effective quality that I should outline early on. I had another Founder mention to me that I should start the presentation with ""2000 Registrations"", as soon as I introduce the company.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>In general, I like your structure. However, based on the specifics both in the question and your comments, there's another shape you could use. </p>

<p>Your chosen problem is something like this: <strong>""To see all the content I want to see, I need to visit several pages and use multiple accounts.""</strong> </p>

<p>That lends itself to a strong visual representation, and as importantly you can bring insight from the data you have on your 2,000 users - you will already have some ability to put some numbers to the problem, albeit you're going to expect biases compared to the wider market. So I would make my lead-in a simple personal introduction without a slide (e.g. ""Hi! I'm Riad, and I've been social gaming for 6 years"") then straight into visualising the problem.</p>

<p>There are clearly a lot of potential solutions to that problem, and I suspect that you're <em>not</em> going to be able to make any credible claim that it's only you who can see or solve the problem in a way users will love.</p>

<p>If there are people out there addressing this problem to reasonable sized audiences, I would go on to that. Showing solutions, what's great about them and where they suck helps underline the problem as important, and you as having studied and learned from the market. If you can field some quotes from your users, so much the better. And if this is a meaty enough area, I'd have someone else lead it (again, the one line, no slide) intro.</p>

<p>That brings you into a richer presentation of your solution. Most solution pitches I see take one of two forms. Either they just say, ""here's how we're going to solve the problem,"" or they make a quadrant where most rivals sit bottom left, there's a smattering of high-ish left and lowish right, and there they are on their own top right. Neither is convincing, so given that you're in competition, you can do better. So I would look to present your solution as specifically designed to focus on the one, two criteria that matter most to users, and here they are saying that. That not only lets you do the quadrant thing (it <em>is</em> nice to be top right), but also to have in your Q&amp;A what nobody will have - other quadrant diagrams where you're in the pack, and where you're happy to say, ""on our data, the audience who values those criteria are X% of the market, and we're not focusing on them, but on the Y% who value the criteria we showed you.""</p>

<p>So for the deck, you have solution criteria, then you have your solution visualised and contextualised with your achievements on the project right in there, along with something that shows clearly you're an ad-funded project. (Some revenue models aren't worth wasting a full slide on if you have more compelling content to excite the decision makers - show it on a screenshot, then as a line in some table, and you're done.)</p>

<p>That logically takes you on to the near plan - the next one, two or three steps that you intend to do next. But in this suggested outline, the panel have seen and heard from some or all of the team, but there hasn't been a slide. So here's where I'd put in the team slide, and make sure that this connects really strongly to the plan slide that follows.</p>

<p>What that plan slide should be is going to vary according to the accelerator. I'm going to call it a business model plan, but you need to do a bunch of work to understand what kind of numbers you have to present to meet clear criteria, and what style of presentation seems to have worked best for past cohorts.</p>

<p>So that would give you:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard splash</strong> with minimal intro</li>
<li><strong>Visualised problem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Existing solutions</strong> (this may be ""competition"" but my guess is that there are competing answers, not competing companies)</li>
<li><strong>Solution criteria</strong> for a great solution, according to users</li>
<li><strong>Visualised solution</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team</strong> (roles and credentials)</li>
<li><strong>Action plan</strong></li>
<li><strong>Business model</strong></li>
<li><strong>Close</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>That's incomplete. For instance, I'm not worrying about ""How we help our accelerator"" - you'll know what it is, what it's for and where it fits. But some of these may lend themselves to two slides. It's usually better in my view to build out the core, and then see how to use spare slide slots or time best. So you might have a demo you want to put in, or a live metrics read-out, or an Advisory Board to parade, or some slides that you can see have to be in so that you can be scored high against published criteria or expressed intentions.</p>

<p>Don't take my word for any of this. But do test out some different approaches. What you have to be is stand-out, in a good way. And your enemy is the hard fact that most panels have seen so many pitches before that it's easy for your great content to fail to make it into their brains except as examples of something generic.</p>

"How to offer free onsite massages?","115","","<p>Thinking about free offering onsite massages as a one-time perk, but unable to find any guidance online for doing this as a company. </p>

<p>To offer onsite massages, what decisions do I need to make, what needs to be done, and how will I know if doing offering free onsite massages was worth it?</p>
","<p>A massage therapist requires a private room to set up her equipment (a massage bed, massage cream, etc.) and, ideally, a shower for her clients. There are transportable massage beds but you'll be better off with an onsite one.</p>

<p>Note that certifications exist. There's more to massaging than randomly rubbing hands on a body. You can actually harm e.g. the spine by massaging it wrong way, so consider making sure that the therapist has some kind of insurance -- or get one yourself if you recruit her.</p>

"Should the prices be disclosed on the web site?","115","","<p>Being a B2B company and providing mobile software to a niche market in the logistics, and each of our customers usually buying between 15 to 150 units, is it the best approach to disclose our prices on the web site?</p>
","<p>It entirely depends on how your lead generation efforts and sales process are set up, and to some extent on how expensive your product or service is.</p>

<p>If you're set up to take orders online, then obviously yes -- it should be on the site somewhere.</p>

<p>If you're using your site to qualify leads and steer them into asking more information from your sales staff, then the case for showing your prices online is a lot less clear.</p>

<p>The main benefit of disclosing some pricing information online without taking orders is that it can allow you to qualify leads before they even bother trying to contact you.</p>

<p>Let's take the example of a custom app development shop. It could write something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get in touch to discuss your project. (Please note: our minimum project size is $25k.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See how that tiny bit of information might turn off anyone who was looking for a cheap code grunt?</p>

<p>Note, however, that you'd still have no idea of how much your project would cost.</p>

<p>This brings us to the main problem with disclosing precise pricing information upfront or too early: doing so can backlash when the benefits of doing business with you are not clearcut enough yet.</p>

<p>Once the prospect is made keenly aware of the upside they'll get, and convinced that you'll deliver, they'll approach any prices you toss at them with positive ROI in mind. Do so before that, and they'll perceive intolerably high risk -- either the upside is unclear, or your ability to deliver is unclear.</p>

","<p>Note, I wrote for a long time, before noticing annoying ""You need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links, so now I have to re-edit and reformat the whole answer</p>

<hr>

<p>I have been wondering about this a lot as well. This is not a real answer, but I'm new and can't post comments. I am assuming you don't want to go open source and are talking about proprietary app.</p>

<p>From what I've gathered problem is that you don't want to give up details about your idea, for fear of someone else beating you to the punch. I will list some links from what I've figured so far. Any input is appreciated. I will try to divide this into Protecting your idea and Testing viability of the idea/app/project.</p>

<h2> - Protecting your idea</h2>

<ul>
<li>Patent your ""invention""</li>
</ul>

<p>Patents are not cheap and you can wait a long time for approval. If you do get patent, you are covered for, I believe, up to 20 years. But it can easily cost more then development of your whole app (invention)
Now, there is this thing called </p>

<ul>
<li>Provisional Application (often wrongly called Provisional Patent)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_application"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_application</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under United States patent law, a provisional application is a legal
  document filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
  (USPTO), that establishes an early filing date, but does not mature
  into an issued patent unless the applicant files a regular
  non-provisional patent application within one year.</p>
  
  <p>The provisional application is also not ""published"", but becomes a
  part of any later non-provisional application file that references it,
  and thus becomes ""public"" upon issuance of a patent claiming its
  priority benefit. A ""provisional"" is automatically abandoned (expires)
  one year after it is filed.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Non-disclosure agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>go to Wikipedia and read about Non-disclosure_agreement</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality
  agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary
  information agreement (PIA), or secrecy agreement (SA), is a legal
  contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential
  material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Copyright your app</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you can't really copyright an idea, you can however copyright parts of the code, graphics/interface elements .. you get the idea. It is cheaper then patent, but it doesn't stop competition to make a variation of your product. So it only protects you from someone copying your work.</p>

<p>There are more things that I could list here, and I will try and expand this answer later when I catch some time. I will just list few more things before talking about testing if your idea is viable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-Compete Agreement (if you are not developing the app alone)</li>
<li>Trademarking</li>
</ul>

<h2> - How to test the viability of your idea/app/project</h2>

<ul>
<li>Research the potential demand/market size (and Niche if it exists I won't expand on Niches because this would turn into a book)</li>
</ul>

<p>Popular research tools is Google's Keyword Research Tool now named KeywordPlanner there are other alternatives that don't require you to have AdWords account. 
Try to figure how many people are searching for terms that relate to your idea.
Research everything you can, from Twitter (unfortunately Topsy was shut down, but there are alternatives)</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are your potential customers?</li>
<li>Do a Feasibility study </li>
</ul>

<p>Do as much as you can yourself to try to figure out how much the project would cost to develop, what is potential ROI (go to Wiki and read about Feasibility Study since I can't any more links)</p>

<ul>
<li>Build an MVP </li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Test your idea for demand</li>
</ul>

<p>You can build a simple landing page with minor investment in marketing campaign, and analyze if there is interest in your idea/product/app. You can do this even if you haven't created an MVP</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a Business Plan</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule consulting session with experts</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have to stop now, I will edit the answer when I catch some free time.
Hope I at least gave you a basic idea. I am also trying to figure this out.</p>

"How to do Joint Venture with Pvt Ltd Company being a Freelancer?","114","","<p>I am Freelancing  Software Developer .</p>

<p>Recently one Pvt Ltd company approached me to share business ideas and asked me to develop software .</p>

<p>They offering some share in the new startup business.  They asked me to explore possibilities of having a profit share agreement with the Existing company for this new startup . </p>

<p>They are not keen to offer me share in the exiting company and they are offing  shares ONLY  in the new startup only .</p>

<p>They are not in favor to register NEW COMPANY to Run this new startup instead they will run this new start up as one of service from the existing company .</p>

<p>Is there any ways I can tie up with them ?</p>
","<p>The dilemma you're facing is not really new, to be honest.  I can understand why they wouldn't give you shares of the existing company, because you've done nothing for it.  In other words, all of its revenue (hence the value of a share) is based on work done by people other than you.  They want to limit your participation only to the new business, and that makes sense.</p>

<p>Put yourself in their shoes and look at it.  If you own a business and are planning to start a new venture, would you give a share of your existing company to someone who contributed nothing to it?  Of course not.  That wouldn't be wise for you.</p>

<p>It sounds like they plan to segregate the new business into its own wholly owned subsidiary and give you a stake in it, which is logical.  That's where all your value to the company is going, and it keeps things clean and simple.  Let me explain.</p>

<p>If you are given a share of the whole company then its possible you would see no return on your share.  Why?  What if the subsidiary you're working with is the only profitable one, and the losses of the other subsidiaries wipe out all of the profits so that there's nothing to distribute to any of the shareholders?  You would be better off to instead have a share of the subsidiary you're working for, <em>as long as you get some kind of agreement that your distribution of profits is not based on the parent company's profitability</em>.  In other words, you get paid a share of the gross profit of the subsidiary you're working with before it gets combined with revenues of the other subsidiaries.</p>

<p>I would strongly suggest that before you sign or even verbally agree to any kind of arrangement, get it in writing, take it to an attorney, and make sure it protects your interests.  You need to ensure there are no clauses that allow the parent company to sell off your work product without also compensating you, because it isn't unknown for a company to develop a product or service and decide it is more profitable to license it to others rather than produce or provide it themselves, and in such a case you could lose out unless you have that covered in the contract.</p>

<p>If the work you are doing can be patented, copyrighted, or trademarked, you <em>have</em> to make sure that they include you as a co-inventor or co-owner of the intellectual property rights, because if what you're doing has any value, you must make sure you protect your right to a fair share of it.</p>

<p>This can be tricky, but not if you hire a smart attorney who has done this before.  Don't rely on this company's attorneys to do it -- their job is to protect the company's best interests, not yours, no matter WHAT they tell you.  Yes, it will cost you some money to do this, but it is money wellspent to ensure you don't lose out in the long run.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<li>Trying to get <strong>contractual work</strong> by known contacts. This is very hard if you don't already have a name in the business area. Even in my area it might be harder, because contractual customers would mainly be public authorities that will only rely on a solid company background. To ""start a small project"" is probably not possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there similar experiences you can share? Maybe there are other alternatives I did not yet think of?</p>
","<p>Your question is a bit vague and makes it sound like you're not too sure what you're going to be offering or to who, so it's a bit hard to answer. Whatever you do, though, avoid building the product prior to validating that is any demand for it.</p>

<p>Getting contractual work isn't so hard if you spend the needed time to look for clients -- and apparently you do, since your web dev gig is only keeping you busy on a part-time basis.</p>

<p>Use this precious time with newly acquired clients in your target audience to figure out precisely what their needs are. Ensure you retain the relevant IP from a project to the next (use the MIT or BSD license), and your future product's key parts will be built and well understood before you know it.

"Where to incorporate a < $100,000 one man app startup in the US?","114","","<p>I have an app that is making money and I want to incorporate it. I live in New York. From the research I've done it seems like everyone prefers incorporating in Delaware because of the tax and law benefits.</p>

<p>I'm making a little bit of money off (&lt; $100,000) the startup and don't plan on getting investors or selling the company. It's just a successful side project.</p>

<p>Some people also recommend that I just do it in my home state (NY) even with less favorable tax policies because it will be less of a headache. However, my product is just an iOS app and so I'm not clear if that means I am ""doing business in NY"" because none of my transactions happen in NY, I just live here. Ideally I want to be taxed as little as possible.</p>

<p>Where should I incorporate my company?</p>
","<p>In the US, the most common states in which to incorporate are your home state, Delaware, Nevada, or Wyoming (with Wyoming being considerably less popular than Delaware and Nevada).</p>

<p>First, just to be clear, this has nothing to do with tax. Even if you incorporate in a state that is not your home state, you must also register the corporation with your home state (known as ""qualifying a foreign corporation"") to operate in your home state, and you will be subject to the same taxes as if you you were incorporated in your home state. To emphasize this point: it is illegal to incorporate in a state like Delaware, Nevada, or Wyoming, but to operate in another state unless you register your corporation in your home state and pay taxes in your home state. Registering a Delaware corporation without qualifying it in New York and then operating the business in New York can be considered tax evasion in New York and can be considered criminal.</p>

<p>Second, where you incorporate has nothing to do with where you do business. You can be incorporated in Delaware and do business in New York just like any New York corporation.</p>

<p>So why would you incorporate in Delaware, Nevada, or Wyoming? Two words: <strong>Liability</strong> and <strong>Predictability</strong>.</p>

<p>Every corporation relies on what's known as the <em>corporate veil</em> to separate the individuals owning, running, or managing the corporation from the corporate entity itself. The corporate veil is maintained by the state in which a corporation was formed. Some states (New York among them) have activist judiciaries which have been historically more open to piercing the corporate veil and bringing liability directly to individuals behind a corporation.</p>

<p>Delaware and Nevada both have a separate set of courts to deal with businesses. You don't have the same judges that deal with more emotional issues dealing with corporate issues like in most states. As a result, Delaware and Nevada have well established precedents of protecting the corporate veil in all but the most extreme circumstances of fraud. Wyoming is just a very conservative state that follows more classic traditions and has a population strongly opposed to judicial activism.</p>

<p>So which is best? Delaware is great for big corporations (65% of the Fortune 500 is incorporated in Delaware), investment funds of any kind, and any sort of main-stream business that wants its corporate identity maintained in a predictable way. Delaware is also what investors expect, and often if your company is going to be bought-out or even invested in, the investors may insist on you re-incorporating in Delaware. Nevada has carved out a niche in being particularly friendly to corporate managers running high-liability businesses. They have the best record in the US of protecting the corporate veil in all but the most extreme cases of fraud. Nevada is good for the smaller business whose operations have exceptional concerns related to liability. Unfortunately, Nevada's demographics are changing and pressure on the corporate-friendly system now exist. Also, Nevada's corporate fees seem to be skyrocketing every few years. Wyoming, again, is old-school, conservative and if the law says something, their judges tend to feel less entitlement to get emotional and write their own rules.</p>

<hr>

<p>In your case, incorporating in New York and Delaware are both options. Delaware will cost you a little more because you need to maintain two registrations (New  York and Delaware) and an agent in both states. For that you will receive more predictable corporate law, better liability protection, and much less complexity if you end up taking on investors, selling your business, or doing anything else with an outside party.</p>

<p>Most attorneys practicing business law are well-versed in Delaware corporate law as it is de facto standard for corporate law in the US. Personally (I live in Illinois which has similar dynamics to New York), I would not do business in anything other than a Delaware or Nevada entity. But that's just my opinion.</p>

<p>If I was intending to sell directly to consumers, I'd likely hand out flyers and setup billboard ads to raise awareness, but I suspect those advertising methods would be far too broad to effectively reach business clients interested in my services.</p>

<p>How do I let potential business clients know my services exist?</p>
","<p>This will vary a lot depending on what your target business is. Presumably, your software solves a specific business need. That means you have to think about how you might meet people in charge of businesses who have those specific needs. It sounds like you may already have an idea on what that business is. It is definitely hard to walk into a business cold. This does not usually work. That's why cold-calling has been mostly written off as a sales strategy. The difference between cold-calling and walking into a business is three-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's harder to tell someone no to their face</li>
<li>You can set up a primer with in-person visits. Send the company an email beforehand, and if you don't get a response, you've got a reason to go up there. </li>
<li>You can opt to wait at a business without people hanging up on you</li>
</ul>

<p>Networking events are ideal for trying to meet people in position that will help. If you believe that your service can change the community, get involved in the community and start meeting officials in commerce. Commerce chambers are inextricably linked to business decision makers. Commerce officials will become your best advocates; their job is to advocate for stimulating economic growth. This path is, of course, if you want to grow things slowly and sustainably. </p>

<p>If you are eager, don't mind rejection, and can sustain iterative failure, your sales strategy will go like this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Email the business, or department in the business, and discuss a software process that will save them time and money for 'X'. </li>
<li>Tell them you've done research on them and have talked with a lot of similar companies. Tell them they all agreed that 'X' is a big problem, so you developed a service that you believe can save them money and will seamlessly integrate with the current system. Low-to-no setup costs. Whatever the case may be. </li>
<li>Wait for a response. 2-5 business days</li>
<li>If you get a response, keep your pitch brief. Tell them this is not a sales call but that you are looking for a partnership with a business in the area, looking to test cutting-edge software with. </li>
<li>Set up a brief call with them to tell them what you've developed. Schedule a meeting. </li>
<li>If your software is that good, tell them that you are talking with other companies or their competitors. Tell them other people are interested. </li>
</ol>

<p>Most businesspeople are reasonable businesspeople, else they would not be businesspeople. Fair is fair. That means they cannot help be interested in real business opportunities.

"Could the public perception of jailbreaking be damaging for a mobile app developer?","113","","<p>Currently, at my company we develop apps for the standard app stores. We have had some ideas though that wouldn't be passable on the Apple App store even though they don't involve piracy or any illegal activity. </p>

<p>There is the possibility of releasing these apps on Cydia, the app store for jailbroken devices. Would we risk harming our image if we release products through this outlet? Do people have a negative perception of jailbreaking?</p>
","<p>I'm not sure whether individuals have issue with the concept of jailbreaking, but I <em>do</em> think the conceptual ""system,"" as they say, does. Not to mention, I don't really imagine Apple would be too keen on having legitimate apps be placed on an illegitimate app store.</p>

<p>I tend to think of jailbreaking kind of like I think of things like the Darknet or torrent sites. Yeah, they can be used for totally acceptable things, but they can also be used to radically unacceptable things. Of course, jailbreaking is still a little more respectable than piracy or whatever nonsense is going on through the Darknet, but I think the stigma is a bit the same. Not to mention, the user-base is probably pretty similar on each too.</p>

<p>So yes, in my personal opinion, I think you could risk harming your image. I think it could also be totally fine, but there'd be a risk. I think it would depend a lot on what your app did, and of course we know nothing of that through your question (with good reason), but if it was something <em>really</em> cool and there was no way to make it work on the official app store, that would be okay. But that would be an exception to a general rule, so you'd have to be ready for the people to don't bother looking at what your actual app does, and just pay attention to the fact that you launched it there.</p>

<p>It's really just a trade-off, ultimately, like anything is. Do you think your app will be cool enough and popular enough amongst the demographic of people who jailbreak their phones, to warrant risking the respect of other, more legitimate outlets? I think that ""demographics"" matter is also important--remember that there aren't really a lot of people who do that, so be careful to weigh the potential risk against the potential gains of such a targeted release.</p>

<p>It would also depend a bit on what apps you've already released, and in particular, <em>how many</em> apps you've already released. If you've got one on this app store and twenty successful ones on the legitimate one, that's much less of a deal than if you have one on this store and one on the legitimate one.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>

<p>It depends on the legal system of your country. Some countries don't have any law regarding copyright / plagiarism, some countries do have law. That said, there are some 'general' rules that seem to apply in most situations:</p>

<p>Basically the original author of the work holds the intellectual property. That basically means that if the author doesn't want you to have it, you cannot use it. Now, since he's publishing the work (I assume on a <em>public</em> profile!) you can assume that he implicitly allows you to use it. </p>

<p>That said, you <em>cannot</em> claim it is your own work. Basically this means that if you use it, you should hold a backreference to the original URL and be transparent that you don't claim any rights. If the owner asks you to remove the data, you must comply.</p>

<p>Now, things also depend on the definition of plagiarism in your legal area. Usually the definition tells that copying a few lines is okay -- and everything beyond that is considered plagiarism. </p>

<p>Aggregating data (e.g. creating derived work based on a 'fairly large' variety of sources) is usually considered 'creating new work' and is therefore allowed. Again, you use information from sources as your information sources, so you should be transparent about that and provide them with the option to remove their content from your database.</p>

<p>If you just copy data from one website and host it by yourself, you're usually in the 'black part' of the 'gray area'; if you're aggregating information from multiple websites (e.g. Google), you're more in the 'white part'.</p>

<p>Things like complying with <em>robots.txt</em> and being polite when building web crawlers are very much in the gray area, but my strong recommendation is to simply comply with them. Similarly, fill in your robot ID with a webpage that contains information people can use to remove content, how the crawler works, etc. Best not to get blocked from a website when it can be avoided.</p>

<p>If you extract certain pieces of information from the content, in particular: personal information such as address, telephone numbers, contact information, etc, you usually fall within another area of the legal system. Best to be very, very careful about this and check this with the correct privacy institute or a good lawyer. (F.ex. in the Netherlands this is the ""CBP - College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens"" - which is roughly translated as 'government privacy institute').</p>

<p>Either way, if you're in doubt, best to check with a lawyer.</p>

"Is there a clear cut methodology for defining your vision/mission statement?","113","","<p>I've red about how having a well defined vision and mission statement can sometimes make or break a company. I've also heard stories where companies had to bring a management guru on-board to help them define their mission statement and this makes me think that there might be a methodology somewhere in there.</p>

<p>My question is do I just start writing what I believe the mission should be, or is there some process and are there any rules to it?</p>
","<p>To begin with, make sure you avoid the biggest trap of all. Namely, that clients have little interest in labels, features, processes, or credentials:</p>

<ul>
<li>Label: ""here's what our product is.""</li>
<li>Feature: ""here's what our product can do.""</li>
<li>Process: ""here's how our product does it.""</li>
</ul>

<p>Clients are interested in solutions, answers, and benefits. You want your unique selling proposition to lay out one of the latter <em>in terms of client needs and wants</em>. Again: not in your words; in theirs.</p>

<p>Start by brain dumping your clients' problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are your clients' primary concerns?</li>
<li>What needs of theirs do your services meet?</li>
<li>What solutions do you provide to meet these needs?</li>
<li>What end results (as in value) do they receive by using your product or service?</li>
<li>Which of these results differentiate you from your competitors?</li>
</ul>

<p>This should give you a few ideas already. Then ask them directly to gather more data:</p>

<ul>
<li>What made you decide to sign up / purchase / subscribe?</li>
<li>How would you describe what we do?</li>
<li>What's one thing that we do better than / sets us apart from our competitors?</li>
<li>Would you / do you refer us?</li>
</ul>

<p>Dig a bit deeper when you get a positive reply to that last question:</p>

<ul>
<li>What would you / do you say when you refer us?</li>
<li>How would you describe good service?</li>
<li>Can you tell us a story or a time when we provided good service?</li>
<li>What did this good service entail? / What value did you derive from it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Important: <strong>you want raw, unprocessed answers in a live interaction</strong>. If you send the questions by email or something to that effect, you'll get 5-times rephrased ""I'd like to say nice things about you"" types of answers. They're pointless. So pick up your phone or catch your clients in Skype.</p>

<p>Tell them you'd like to refine your marketing message and ask them a few questions on how they perceive your business. Then casually steer the conversation in a way that you eventually ask these questions or some interesting variation of them. And learn more things along the way on what they do, etc.</p>

<p>Once you've a few interesting one or two short sentence descriptions of what you do, test them to see which one works best:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you comfortable saying your new marketing message out loud?</li>
<li>Does an adolescent instantly grok what you do? (Try it; it can be sobering.)</li>
<li>Does it start a conversation with your potential leads?</li>
<li>Does it prompt others to ask you questions?</li>
</ul>

"Recommended place to sell a domain, trademark, more... of a failed startup?","113","","<p>I am about to close a startup of mine, started over 6 years ago.</p>

<p>At first, I only thought of selling the domain name, but then I realized that, if bundled properly, it may be worth much more, as 6+ years of high visibility through Google Search, plus 3 years in a row in which sales grew about 500% per year, may be worth something.</p>

<p>This domain also has matching Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Google Play accounts (exact name as domain as tradename and trademark.</p>

<p>What is the best venue to go about this?</p>

<p>Note: Maximizing sale value is not the only factor. An important consideration is also a safe and trustworthy way to transfer payment.</p>
","<p>The quick answer to your question is: <strong>go look at Flippa.com</strong>, as probably the most active market for domains plus content. If current revenue is small, my guess is that a third party business or domain broker won't see much realizable value.</p>

<p>There may be other choices. </p>

<p>Do you feel you've proved that the market you were aiming at isn't there, or is dominated by a major player? If so, then <strong>you may have assets worth selling</strong>, as long as you remember that the whole is <em>less</em> than the sum of the parts. So make the longest list you can of assets, and against each one, ask </p>

<ol>
<li><p>How could I monetize this?</p></li>
<li><p>Who else might value this, and why?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have your list, triage. If there's no obvious buyer but there is a monetization route, invest a little time trying it out. So for instance, could your website morph into a simple content site to leverage the search engine history? If there's value to a third party then try some direct approaches.</p>

<p>Or do you feel that while you hit the wall, <strong>someone else might be ready to take it forward</strong>. Given new vision, new leadership and new resources, many projects could be viable. If that's possible, get out there and network. The deal you offer is a way for someone to earn their way to a majority share, with a <em>future</em> exit route for you. Will that suit everyone? No way! But the right person...</p>

","<p>Just because you don't have any jobs at the moment, doesn't mean that you won't in the future, and that you cannot put up a framework already. Many companies have job pages which are location they can place jobs as they become available. </p>

<p>you're right in saying that it seems more 'legit', and I would offer a few key points.</p>

<p>1.Be tactful in how you say you aren't hiring on you jobs page. Perhaps you'll want a message that says something to the effect of ""we aren't currently hiring"" and encourage them to check back later. </p>

<p>2.Model it after the rest of the site. A common theme promotes recognition of the website, and allows the user to begin to familiarize that style with your company.In this instance, its a good thing that you have a jobs page since it allows the user to associate more with your site's style.</p>

<p>3.Lastly when you do begin hiring, be sure to post it there. Don't circumvent the very system you put in place.</p>

"Comparison between money and users","112","","<p>In a startup, what has more value between having a <strong>million dollars capital</strong> or a <strong>million active users</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Type of business:</strong> Online Business</p>

<p>For the time being, the million users are paying <em>nothing</em> for the service. And let's say maintain the service costs 1 million / month (Maybe too much).</p>
","<p>In the case where a user bring you $1 a month and your service costs $1 per user, million dollars in capital is more valuable but that doesn't seem like a business anyways.</p>

<p>A good business means, you earn more money from a user than the cost of acquiring the user plus the cost of keeping the user. Normally user value is worth more than a $1. Users are especially valuable in saas businesses.</p>

<p>Social network companies has lower value for users, when Twitch sold, it was worth $18 per user, Instagram $25 per user, Tumblr $8 per user. These companies make their money from ads which brings low amount of money per user compared to saas. Of course there is the network effect which increases the value of a customer as there are more customers using the service. </p>

<p>On the other hand acquiring a user changes for each sector but it is around $0.5 to $5. So it usually actually costs more than $1 to bring a user to your product. </p>

<p>What I am trying to say is, in the software industry x amount of users is almost always more valuable than x amount of dollars.</p>

<p>Even if they are not paying now, they will probably be monetized somehow in the future.</p>

"How much trust is sufficient for a cofounder?","112","","<p>If people have been reading my questions, it sounds like I distrust my cofounder. I don't.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is get a feel how things are done with someone who I have only met once in my life and we only got hooked up by angelist.co. </p>

<p>So on the one hand he can be a scammer trying to raise funds and then run off somewhere or he can be a legitimate person who it trying to avoid paying legal fees and incorporating fees until the start up starts bringing in some money.</p>

<p>The startup is split 60/40 with he having the 60% so he'd be expected to pay for the fees and not I. I am to put more time in it.</p>

<p>So does anyone have a good rule of thumb how much trust do you need for a cofounder in order to work with him?</p>
","<p>In short, i'll give you the following advice...</p>

<p>You ask, ""how much trust is sufficient for a cofounder""? I say it goes way beyond trust.
I've been involved in quite a number of start-ups over the years and have witnessed quite a bit. I assure you though, trust is not the only item that you want to look at... For example: how engaged is this cofounder of yours? Will you be putting in the 70+ hours a week, while he's putting in only 40? How is your cofounders decision making? Does he crack under pressure? Does he fall into the ""analysis paralysis"" mode and afraid to move forward? Personally, I wouldn't venture into anything with someone that I didn't know well. You may find that you both get along great, but then find out what his true colors are like...</p>

<p>Suggestion - if this is something that is already happening (whereas, he's the official cofounder) - be sure to get as much in writing as possible. You need to state specifics of positions/responsibilies/power of decision, etc. </p>

<p>Also, how can you say you 'trust' this guy only after meeting him once in your life? You really don't know anything about this guy and i think you're rushing into this without more research. </p>

<p>As far as him owning 60% and you own 40%, so he could pay for the 'fees' - what fees are you referring? How exactly is the business being formed? Is the product patented/provisional patent? Just because he owns more of the equity doesn't necessarily mean that he is expected to pay for the fees and not you. If this is just a general partnership and not a separate entity, then you will be responsible for quite a bit - legally if someone sued the company.</p>

<p>When you state that you're expecting the cofounder that owns 60% of the startup, what exactly is he paying? You would be doing all the work (what type of work?).</p>

<p>You say he will help raise funds, but have you completed a business plan and financials yet? Reason i ask, is why do you need money if he's already putting money into the company? Do you have a customer base? Typically you don't want to consider raising funds until you've shown revenue with your company. You also want to be self sufficient, but as you grow, if you had invoices in hand and/or documented and verified orders, THEN it would make sense to go for additional investors, since you'd now have something of interest to them and they won't take majority of your equity away quicker. Remember, if you have only an idea for a business with no real substance other than an idea, some marketing figures, etc. The investors will demand 51-90% of the ownership, based on the calculated risk, the time their money is tied up and many other factors.</p>

<p>Here's the last question... If you guys are 'partners' and you're doing all the work, and he's only putting in some money, yet he starts off with 60%... This sounds whacky to me... If you put in 100 hours of work and he only pays for $1000 for the formation of the business, business cards and a couple other little things, then he gets the additional 20% of the company, whereas you're working for about $10/hour (based on his initial cost of $1k - just as a figure to give you an idea of my thought process here) - so in essence, you're both putting in equal money (or equivalency of time), yet he gets 60% and you 40%? </p>

<p>I suggest, you seriously reconsider moving so quickly, do more research. Get to know this potential partner on a better basis. I just fear that you're put in all this effort and it really could backfire and set you back. You need help from a seasoned business person.</p>

<p>very best,</p>

","<p>Note that the title of that article is ""12 Steps to better code"". Coding is only a small part of what goes on in the development department and an even smaller part of what goes on in a development company.</p>

<p>The practices in the article are ranging from essentials to general good practices for a development house. Your startup should have a lot more than than those to be a professional development house but they are a good starting point. Among the things I can think of to add to that list in a professional setting would include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Product life cycle management</li>
<li>Project management </li>
<li>A determined development methodology - waterfall, rad, prototyping, SDLC , agile, waterfall etc</li>
<li>Standardization - Coding standards, committing standards, design patterns etc</li>
<li>Maintenance practices</li>
<li>Internal project documentation</li>
<li>Product documentation </li>
<li>Standardized work flow and operating procedures</li>
<li>Formal pre-market testing </li>
<li>Formal post-market evaluation</li>

<p>A startup is also more than just about development and would also need good standardized practices on the business side as well. Such as on sales and marketing, customer service, HR and policies and good management practices. </p>

<p>In a business setting, a development department cannot survive if the other structures such as sales are not holding up.

","<p>There's a sensible flow there. You could trim it to 6-10 slides, but you already know that. So I'm going to focus on how to build in a bit more tip to the bullet, silver or otherwise.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, <strong>there's only one slide that really matters</strong> from the investor's point of view. That's slide 7. If you truly have higher security at lower cost, I'm listening. If not, then I'm only interested if I have a portfolio gap.</p>

<p>So as you know, you need to have in the top of your mind ten times the content on the slides, focused on the questions you want to answer and the questions you mustn't duck. That is going to mean testing this claim to destruction from three angles. </p>

<p>First, you need to <strong>demonstrate that it's important</strong>. Every industry has a backlog of innovation that can increase quality and decrease cost. So you have to show not just that you have something better than the competition, but that you are <strong>creating new market space where the competition can't go</strong>.</p>

<p>Second, you need to <strong>find every other potential challenger who aspires to be in your quadrant</strong>. Because if you've demonstrated that the incumbents aren't going to be the playmakers, you've moved the focus of questioning. So you need to line up every potential and actual player, and know how you're going to partner with, outpace or outflank them.</p>

<p>Third, and last, you need to <strong>build an evidence bundle of why it's demonstrably true</strong>. What are the tests and objective measures, who are the people outside your team who are staking their reputations, who are the customers who are saying what they'll do that's totally new, as soon as you deliver the solution on top of the technology you've shown them?</p>

<p>As I say, most of this work isn't to make new slides or change old ones, it's to make you stand out under questioning. But some of it will need to slip in. So for instance, I really don't care who ""likes your project"" (slide 2). Lots of famous people like liking projects: it costs nothing. But if you've got someone in your corner who's really, really challenged you, that's golden.</p>

<p>Similarly I don't care there's a thing called disruptive innovation. But if there's a sector that owns a market and is holding its customers back from doing new things that don't make sense to the suppliers, and you've a bunch of those customers in tow, you have my undivided attention.</p>

<p>Good luck! I'm looking forward to a new wave of security printing!</p>

</ul>
","<p>Generally you can deduct or depreciate equipment, but the rules can vary based on the purchase price.  Since tax laws change year-to-year, you really need to speak to a CPA or do your own research on the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Deducting-Business-Expenses"">IRS website</a> to see which rules apply to your specific scenario.  Many rules depend on your ownership structure and annual revenue.</p>

<p>No special paperwork is required prior to the purchase but it's a good idea to have receipts for everything.  You do not have to register the business but it's a good idea to open a separate checking account for the business as early as possible.  You can use a personal checking account, but personal accounts have certain restrictions which you may find too limiting, so you may want to open a business checking account.

<li>It is always good to have investors at any stage. As others have mentioned, it might be difficult to get them interested at this stage, but if you find an investor that likes your idea there is no reason to wait. The process of pursuing investors will help you refine your idea, so it isn't really lost time, anyway.</li>
<li>There are quite a few tools and service for market analysis that you can find with a simple web search, but I would suggest <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Trends</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/insights/search/"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Insights</a> for getting a general lay of the land.</li>
<li>If investors are keen to help with specific containers then by all means follow the money. The investors' help with marketing in the area they are familiar with could be even more valuable than their cash.</li>

"Is a trial with full capacity or a free version with limited capacity better?","111","","<p>I have a SaaS (let's people extract data from pdfs and video files) that offer a 14 day trial. The trial is severely limited, the amount of job one can complete in this period is slow on purpose. I have some customers complaining that it's too slow and give up entirely. But I explain that this is the trial, you are sharing resources with other people.</p>

<p>Should I have a free plan instead with the same limited features? (slow and shared rate of job completion)?</p>

<p>Or should my trial plan have limits removed? Let them use it to the full extent for 14 days. My worry is that somebody will get their money's worth in 14 days and choose not to buy afterwards. Should I include 'demo evaluation' messages in the data they extract?</p>

<p>My rationale is to make it slow and limited until they decide to upgrade. But this might or might not be happening?</p>
","<p>You need to experiment further. It's <strong>way more hassle</strong> to try out a free version and then decide it was a mistake, so experiment with your free trial.</p>

<p>In my opinion, ""free trial"" makes me expect I'm trying out the real experience, so if my trial sucks, why would I buy? So my gut says, give a full-strength service, except where you can create limits that make sense to you and to the user. Maybe limiting the file size, or total uses, might fit this. But as you can change this at any time, I would start simple. </p>

<p>So to summarise what I'd do in your case:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Deliver the full experience, for a free trial, with credit card details required</p></li>
<li><p>Split test on trial duration - looking at sign-up intentions, completed sign-ups, completed product uses, and post-trial continuation</p></li>

"UK SaaS with EU business customers - who owes what rate of VAT?","111","","<p>I'm trying to get my head around the changes to the EU's VAT laws that occurred in 2015 as my UK SaaS business is starting to contract with EU customers. A lot of the VAT documentation online is consumer-focused (i.e. where the buyer is not VAT registered).</p>

<p>So with an example, using the euro for currency simplicity:</p>

<p>If I'm a UK business, and I sell SaaS access for 1000 euros to a French business, who owes VAT? To whom is it owed? How much is owed?</p>
","<p>From article 44 of the <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006L0112"" rel=""nofollow"">VAT directive</a>:</p>

  <p><em>Example 19: For accountancy services supplied by a Bulgarian company to a business customer with his place of business in Austria, Austrian VAT must be charged. If the Bulgarian supplier is not established in Austria, the Austrian customer will account for VAT under the reverse charge mechanism.</em></p>

"Finding Advisor(s) without Too Much Publicity?","110","","<p>What is the best way to put together a board of advisors for a tech SaaS startup without too much publicity?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I would like to keep the project a low profile until its ready to roll. I'm trying to avoid too much awareness for the competition or to give others ideas. </p>

<p>I prefer to deliver ""<em>shock &amp; awe</em>"" to competitors vs some ""<em>oh, new competition is coming, lets take them down before they get too big</em>"".</p>

<p>For those reasons, I'm not interested in creating profiles on startup websites such as angel.co or sending out emails to every advisor/agency out there.</p>

<p>I'm a solo developer and since I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere it is not like I can just reach to some local startup experts, as they are just not here.</p>

<p>In regards to ""hiring"" advisors what should be the priority order.</p>

<p><strong>Board of advisors</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Startup / Funding Expert</p></li>
<li><p>Legal / CPA, </p></li>
<li><p>Tech &amp; Engineering</p></li>
<li><p>Product &amp; Design</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing + Branding, </p></li>

<li><p>Customer Support</p></li>
<li><p>Other?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From the list above, do they all deserve equity or would be better to just pay cash some of those above and save the equity for future employees etc?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Is it common to sign non-disclosure agreements with potential advisor before even talking any details about the project?</p>
","<p>Most advisors expect equity because startups are usually cash strapped and equity has become a norm. The equity doesn't have to be big something from .1 or .05 to 1% depending on the stage you are in and how important the advisor is. If you are able to pay cash and want to save on equity, which is not a bad idea if you have cash, you can offer them cash. Say, a particular amount per consultation, or per meeting or per month/quarter. Be realistic about what you can afford and the value you are seeking to get from them. You can also set performance monitors and weed out non contributors. You can replace some advisors with consultants and you can save on equity. </p>

<p>NDAs do serve their purpose and if you are concerned with your idea being leaked out, you can ask for an NDA and to disclose conflict of interests. This is not unusual for positions like this and would help you get more from them as you can have more open discussions. Be wary about people who serve on multiple boards, refuse to sign NDAs, is too eager to discuss fees and payments. </p>

<p>There are many places to find advisors. Linkedin is a good place and many people list advisory roles and board positions in their profile. Other places to look for them are startup sites like cofounderslab, SBA in your state, friends, people you may know, colleagues, former bosses, relatives and family etc. </p>

<p>Be realistic about your need for advisors. You may not need them all at the same time and you may find that they take more time than you can afford. Add advisors based on your stage and what you are doing at present. </p>

<p>This site has a good discussion on the amount of equity to give to advisors - <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/free-startup-docs-how-much-equity-should-advisors-get/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/free-startup-docs-how-much-equity-should-advisors-get/</a></p>

<p>Addendum</p>

<p>Determining which advisors to add</p>

<ol>
<li>Do not add advisors because it would look impressive to investors - This is the wrong reason to get advisors. You would disappoint the advisors, investors can tell and you would loose equity, time and money early on</li>
<li>Get advisors to fill gaps - Identity which areas you need help with - if you lack technical skills, a technical advisor who has experience with your tech area would be useful. If you lack a business network, an advisor with industry connections might be useful.</li>
<li>Assess when you would need the advisor - You may not need an HR advisor if you are building your prototype in your basement/garage lab. Figure out when you would need advisors and get them only when you would need them. A good way would be <strong>keep a list of potential questions you need to clarify and sort them by category</strong>. You would find that you can answer most these questions online or with a little research on your own. If a particular category keeps growing, and the need for getting answers to that category becomes pressing, you can consider getting an advisor</li>
<li>Do you need an advisor - Sometimes all you need is someone to run things by, gripe and vent or to get some feedback. You may not need an former Fortune 500 CEO or a retired UCLU professor for that. A good friend, a spouse or your mum might be enough. </li>
<li>Consider other sources of advice - you can find good sources of advice online or even connect with experienced people on forums and QA sites like this who can help you. If your need is a one of thing like say a patent or a legal contract, product design etc, you can hire a lawyer or a consultant for a single consultation. There are several advantages to this, including the flexibility to shop around.</li>
<li>Don't be quick to add a recurring expense or give up equity - If your startup is pre revenue, be careful about the recurring payments you add. Your equity may not have much value now, but later may have more value later. Loosing equity can also lead to you loosing control of your company depending on the rights of the shares you gave away.</li>
<li>You can outgrow your advisors - If you got an advisor today to help you with some technical difficulting in the startup stage, you may not have need for him 3 years from now and your business has matured. Have a system to end advisory relationships.</li>
</ol>

<p>To sum up, exhaust other means of getting advice before getting an advisor, assess your needs and your system for managing advisors before getting one. </p>

<p>It would be hard to suggest which advisor you need to start with without more information. Judging by what you have told about your situation and how you are going solo, I think you are confident of your skills and abilities. So, you may not need a technical advisor to help you make your product. If you cannot figure out production aspects of your product, that would be an advisor with manufacturing experience might be helpful. If you have finished your product but you do not know how to sell it, then, an advisor with business development experience in your industry or product category might be helpful. It depends on your skills and the stage your startup is in.</p>

<p>Unlikely.  At least, in the UK (and I imagine it's the same in the US), any such claim would be for damages (whether contractual or tortious): ""<em>in the event you return to correct all problems</em>"", there would be minimal damage and therefore little prospect of a successful claim.</p>

<p>The requirement for such an insurance policy is to provide the client with comfort against the possibility that you do not (or cannot) return to correct the problems.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As additional info, I'm living in Monterrey, Mexico.</p>
","<p>OK, I’m not sure how should've I answered this question so it wouldn’t be deleted. :) In my opinion, it’s a pretty straightworward answer if someone looking for a developer and I know where to find him. But probably my answer should be more general so I’ll try to give an answer on exact question.</p>

<p>I would say that in terms of an app it may be reasonable to test it on one platform before launching on another. As on the first stages you most likely will be changing your app a lot, so it would be tough to reflect all those changes on app for another platform.</p>

<p>The solution of this might be considering using tools that allow you to build cross-platform or partly cross-platform apps. There are things like Cordova/PhoneGap that allows you to build fully cross-platform apps without any code duplicating (however, those apps are not truly native as they’re based on a WebPage). Also there are tools that allow you to make a different UI parts for your apps but share the code of the core of your app (React Native, Xamarin). That would help you to avoid redundancies of development process, especially on the early stages when you have to be lightning fast with development of new features. And unlike PhoneGap it gives you a truly native experience.</p>

<p>But if considering not just developing an app, but creating a <em>product</em> or a <em>company</em>, I would say that having a cofounder is always a good thing. And I think that the most importance of this is not because you need someone to copy your code to the another platform, but because you need someone to discuss your ideas with; someone, who will support you in case you get in tough situations; someone who can share with you his experience in the things that you might not know very well.</p>

<p>So in summary, my opinion is that all cases you provided are reasonable, but in any case it’s not worth it just hanging out a year because you haven’t found a cofounder yet. Spend a few weeks trying to find him and if you don’t, just move on and try to launch an app yourself while continuing searching.</p>

"Preparation for a Startup","110","","<p>My friend and I worked together at a project at the university he is doing his PhD on it and we want to make a start-up out of it if the development works out. I have a day job now and do not work on the project with him together. We have some great people with whom we worked and could work with in the future. The product has in my opinion great potential if we solve the technical difficulties. The point is, it will take another two years to finish his PhD which will also be the time by when the product should be able to be sold. </p>

<p>Now my question: What can I do during these two years, to maximize the probability of a successfull start-up. I have thought about a few things I could do like: save money as starting capital, look for a incubator were we can operate from the first few years and look for people to help with our kickstarter campaign.</p>
","<p>You'll want to first ensure you have a market for your product.  Great technology has no value in business unless you can develop a business model to exploit the revenue generating capabilities of the technology.  </p>

<p>You could start the process of customer discovery.  Identify what sort of person would your customers might be.  You could try making mockups or prototypes of the product. For consumer products this could be drawings, mockups out of cardstock or wood, or even actual product prototypes. For software you could start with screen mockups, clickable wireframes, or even hand sketches on paper. Then meet with prospective customers show them the prototype and get their feedback.  Don't be shy about asking if they would pay for the product, and if so how much.</p>

<p>Other more general activities you can do is to start getting involved in your local startup ecosystem.  Networking is important.  If things go well you'll need advice and services from lawyers, finance, accounting, marketing, recruiting and more. Best way to get these connections is through referrals from your network.  Finding a mentor that has done this before would be a huge boon and make your journey less lonesome.</p>

<p>Take advantage of this time to learn more about the startup process, minimal viable product development, startup financing, etc. You might need to learn more about a specific industry or competitors.  These are all great uses of your time for now.</p>

The value which you can offer a potential customer base may not come from the raw data, reformatted into your new model... the value may come from the pre-digested results and statistics which your model can produce.  Offering a paid subscription to a web-service which constantly reports trends and statistics on a growing dataset is a viable business model; especially if the extreme complexity of that growing dataset makes it difficult for users to calculate those trends and statistics on their own.</p>

<p><strong>Edited due to new information from Comments...</strong>  </p>

<p>Your targetted audience is therefore Enthusiasts of the Japenese Written Language, which is (in theory) a rather large audience.  If you deliver your product as a normalized database, you are limiting that audience to the subset which knows how to query a database.  Although not an empty set, this is a much more limited audience.  So again, I would recommend marketting the product of your data modelling, not the model itself.</p>

<p>One of the things I like most about StackExchange is that it has gamified the sharing of knowledge.  I think that you could do very well, gamifying the interaction of Japenese Language Enthusiasts.  Contests whose answers are drawn from your database, could be posted openly, allowing visitors to compete for points while you are collecting their contact and demographic information.  Such a site could be supported by advertising, by the sale of customer information to affiliate and email marketters, and game-token purchases.  Perhaps a visiter is only allowed to enter one contest per day for free, but tokens let them enter more.</p>

<p>A subscription model might work around a set of practice tools, flash-cards and other memory aids, aimed at Language Contest competitors.  You might also want to offer question generation services for Language Contest Organizers.</p>

<p>All of this is about leveraging the better-than-average access which your data model would grant you over the public data.  Sell the results, not the method.</p>

"How do I do market research without leaking my start-up idea","108","","<p>I have a start-up idea that I have begun planning. It involves buying sports supplements, private labelling them, and selling to shops and gyms for resale into a <strong>niche</strong> market.</p>

<p>So far I have costs from the suppliers that seem reasonable. I have an idea of the branding I want to apply to the products to appeal to the niche. I can guess the order volumes that the vendors may take but I'd like to approach them to ask:</p>

<p>Please consider my response below, but regarding your question I can tell you the following: It will go beyond this topic but just a hint for a direction: there are studies in the field of psychology and clinical psychology research, where the true intentions of the research are disguised from the attendees. Otherwise many experiments would fail due to bias. Think about the classic <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">milgram experiment</a>, where no one of the attendees knew about the real purpose of the test. </p>

<p>Consider, that others may not ""steal"" your innovation just because you involve them in your market research.</p>

<p>Just by doing your research, you do not proof anything to anyone yet. (Unless you release your results, indicating trillions of profit.)</p>

<p>Think about you being an established competitor. If you would follow every trail (means investing valuable money into the blue) you would go down.</p>

<p>Your idea will rather be of interest, once it has been proven to the market. Otherwise it can be considered as a risk.</p>

"How do I figure out the value of options offered? Any relation to preferred shares?","108","","<p>I'm offered 40,000 options in a startup.  The options vest over 4 years (vest immediately if company is bought or goes public) and cost $0.50 each.  How do I figure out how much they are really worth?  I don't know the total number of outstanding shares in the company which is too bad, because I think I can make an educated guess of the possible sale price of the company.</p>

<p>Somebody suggested that if I could find out the price of the preferred shares bought by investors it would be useful.  If I understood him correctly, the idea is that the investors know what they are doing and pay a fair price for their shares.  But how are my options related to preferred shares?  I've been told that the price is often set at 10% of the price of a preferred share.  Does this mean it takes 10 common shares to make 1 preferred share?  Or do they just give employees a low cost basis?</p>

<p>As you can see, I'm having trouble even getting started with evaluating the offer.  I.e. what questions do I need to ask?</p>

Dave</p>

"How do I gauge the market?","108","","<p>I have heard from a lot of startup talks that an ideal market for launch would be a market which is small and very fast growing.</p>

<p>I can gauge whether the market is small, but how can I exactly gauge whether it would be fast growing.  If it is already, then how can I ensure that it is not a bubble (or would have a steep end)?</p>

<p>Is it through pure intuition or experience, or are there indicators or metrics through which I can gauge the market?</p>
","<p>This question relies heavily on the type of industry your in and product you want to market, but I will try to give the most general answer possible to cover most bases.</p>

<p>In terms of gauging initial market the main thing to do it to try and find Problem-Solution Fit. This meaning that you have identified a major problem for a set of people and have identified the correct solution to solve this problem.</p>

<p>You stated that you can tell if the market is big, and that's a good start. Now the next step is to brainstorm a few customer archetypes that you think would make good early adopters.</p>

<p>Then go and find some of the people who fit these archetypes and conduct problem-solution interviews with them. A really good resource on how to conduct these interviews without a lot of bias can be found in the <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/mobile/0636920020141.do"" rel=""nofollow"">book ""Running Lean"" by Ash Maurya</a>. You should get a good idea if these people are a good fit for early adopters after a 5+ interviews with different people in each archetype.</p>

<p>It is best to try to find one solid customer archetype who REALLY wants your product, build for them and then expand into the mainstream market.</p>

<p>You also asked if there were metrics you could track, and many industries have this information available. However, in the early stages these ""quantitative metrics"" may not be helpful. As opposed to in-person interviews which may be useful ""qualitative metrics"" to guide you in the right direction early on.</p>

"Is an idea worth pursuing if it won't make money?","108","","<p>I have what I think is a great idea for a consulting practice. It meets the following criteria, which tells me it can be something I will follow through with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I interested in this field and passionate about it? Yes. </li>
<li>Am I experienced and knowledgeable in this field? Yes.  </li>
<li>Am I credentialed in this field? Yes. </li>
<li>Am I committed to success in this field? Yes.</li>
<li>Would I do this for free? Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>There is only one problem: As currently conceived, there is no room in it for making money.</strong> </p>

<p>The reason is that I don't think the target audience would be willing to pay for it. I am reasonably confident they would accept my services for free. But I suspect that if I try charging, they will turn away. It's not anything essential that they can't live without, and they've managed just fine so far without me around. </p>

<p><strong>My question is, Where do I go from here?</strong> </p>

<p>Should I pursue this? Is there any value in giving this a go if common sense dictates that profits would be elusive? Or am I doing/thinking about this totally wrong? </p>

<p>I have already done something similar in the past (although in a different subject domain). It was a small one-man nonprofit, something I was (and still am) passionate about. But it never was intended to, and never did, generate income. Only some very minor expenses. I am starting to wonder if I have it what it takes to engage in a successful for-profit entrepreneurial activity. </p>
","<p>Headline: <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/21/technology/twitter-10th-anniversary/"">10 years later, Twitter still isn't close to making money</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Were you happy with the impact the first project?</strong>  </p>

<p>The rule of thumb for an entrepreneur is to ""look for a problem you can solve and monetize the solution"" but this also leads to a ton of flaky ideas, startups (most of them) with no chance of success, and in some cases, predatory monetization models where the product may actually cause harm.  If your only motivation is money, wasting other people's on an untenable concept, preying on weakness, or causing harm with unsafe products is not a concern, except in the sense of legal liability.  </p>

<p>You sound like someone who wants to make a positive impact, regardless of financial returns.  Since most startups won't make money, one way of looking at it is that you're already ahead of the game.  At the end of the day, you'll have produced something useful, where the failed startups will have merely lost their investment capital.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds might be someone to look at.  Although I think he has a fairly high networth today, there is no indication his motives with Linux were financial.</p>

<p>John D. Rockefeller may be worth looking at as well.  There is a famous story about him giving away free lamps so people would have a need for the lamp oil he sold.  Where a market didn't exist, he'd created it.  The difference between that and a software product is that you don't have the manufacturing overhead, so your ""lamps"" don't cost anything to mass-produce.  Is it possible that if people start using your product and come to rely on it, there may be some way to gently move toward monetization?</p>

<p>Finally, my experience in big tech is that sometimes companies acquire smaller companies not for their technology or revenues, but for their market-share.  If your application is useful and you can get millions of people using it, someone may become interested in acquiring your company to gain your customer base.</p>

<p>I'm not advising you one way or the other, but merely attempting to provide some perspective.  </p>

<p>Another key question would be: <strong>Will pursuing this project hurt me?</strong>  This could come in the form of losing money, missing out on other potential opportunities, or creating liability with no gain. </p>

<p>We've implemented many of his initial ideas and he's getting a lot of value out of those.</p>

<p>How do we convince this customer that he should start paying without causing bad feelings.</p>
","<p>Depending on the initial agreement, and the market you're in, your beta customer may have a point.</p>

<ul>
<li>he took a risk on your company instead of an established company</li>
<li>he has gone through the pain / problems / etc of all your bug testing</li>
<li>those initial features that you added 'for him' were features that were lacking that he might have been able to get elsewhere (depends on your service)</li>
<li>it's largely irrelevant that he chose to beta-test at least partially to save money - what else would motivate him to take the risk?</li>
<li>people want to feel like part of the original team - they typically don't like getting relegated back to being a 'normal user'</li>
<li>Also, consider that it may just be a good thing to keep a motivated 'customer' that continually adds feedback &amp; bug tests new releases. Giving them free access to your software is pretty cheap in return</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Show him your side &amp; make it mutually beneficial</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he probably isn't thinking about your costs for server space, etc.</li>
<li>maybe you can make an offer, where he pays a small fee to cover your actual operating costs, less labor, etc.</li>
<li>perhaps engage him in marketing - in exchange for telling his network about it, doing a case study with him, etc</li>
<li>make a more formal agreement - he gets a super deal, in exchange for actual agreement to test your new features, participate in user feedback sessions, sit on a user review board, etc</li>

<p>The problem is that no one has published the press release. So it feels like a wasted effort.</p>

<p>Questions 
- what methods could I use to achieve improved brand recognition?

","<p>In our heads, we all still imagine a thing called ""the media"" where there are editors and journalists eager to find stories to develop and run. That world has shrunk.</p>

<p>As I see it, the world of media has become just like most other fields: <strong>it's a relationship management game</strong>.</p>

<p>So if you hire a PR person, the least value they add is distributing the press release. <strong>The only thing that matters is the relationships they build for you.</strong> In the case you describe, you and they had months knowing a story was coming, and between you, you squandered the opportunity to use that time to smooth the path to the story getting circulated.</p>

<p>It's also true that no business story can guarantee finding an outlet, so you need to <strong>develop a plan that generates some volume of stories</strong>.</p>

<p>Arrange a meeting with your PR person. Discuss appropriate <strong>activity measures that will generate relationships that will carry stories</strong>. If they assure you that's not how PR works, fire them and <strong>find someone who's more focused on the value they create for you than the money they extract from you</strong>.</p>

"Tasteful way to say our company emphasizes good works, recycling, etc?","108","","<p>Up front, I think the problem is me, frankly: I usually try to just quietly go above-and-beyond for our customers, but when we did some asking, many customers didn't know a thing we were doing, for example, recycling, giving percentages of our profit to charity, etc <em>and indicated that they would like to</em>. It's unsurprising that they didn't know -- we really haven't said much about it. I've never been one to blow my own horn, which has bled into the company, I guess, and I've felt very reserved about putting what we do out there externally. </p>

<p>I can now see the value in it however... It helps people know and trust a company. So I'd like to at least have that information available. I just don't know how to tastefully or respectfully mention some of what we're about and what we do without sounding elitist or risking alienating our customers.  </p>

<p>For example, we've been grappling for a couple of days on-and-off about how to say we emphasize a low impact on our packing slips: we recycle all paper and we print on recycled paper, etc. We were going back and forth on exactly HOW to say it without, I suppose, <strong>over</strong>emphasizing it. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any overall suggestions? </p>
","<p>This is a super interesting question, and I'd like to say I have a super interesting answer, but I'm really not sure what that might be.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, I can imagine two viable approaches: one passive one and one active one.</p>

<p><strong>Passive</strong></p>

<p>A lot of companies feature on their website some page about what they do to give back to the community. You could do that. I call this approach ""passive,"" because I don't imagine you going around and yelling to everyone you meet ""hey, check out this page on our site that shows how nice we are,"" but it would allow users to find that information, and you could mention it in polite conversation. You could also get away with linking to it from your homepage. I respect your desire for humbleness, but I don't think it'd be too far to have a small block on your page that says ""we think giving back to the community is important, and here's what we do."" You might even be able to phrase it in the name of ""transparency.""</p>

<p>Just a few examples I know of off the top of my head that do something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/serving-communities/employee-giving/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">IBM</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/corporate-responsibility.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Intel</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's not a super great resource because all the companies are, of course, huge, and thus are facing this from a different angle, but <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/04/18/the-100-best-corporate-citizens/"" rel=""nofollow"">Forbes has a list</a> of the best corporate citizens, and you could search for most of those companies, followed by the phrase ""corporate citizenship,"" and find such a webpage.</p>

<p>Also, remember that your webpage could even be phrased more as a political statement. ""We need to save the earth, and here's what <em>[company name]</em> is doing right now."" You can make it about something bigger, and list yourselves only as an example. You could also say you want to set an example for other people and corporations, and perhaps even mention in a very brief way that you don't like to brag but that getting people talking about things is more important than humbleness.</p>

<p><strong>Active</strong></p>

<p>A more active approach, and I certainly don't mean to imply that this is disjoint from the passive one I mentioned above, they could in fact work very closely together, is to involve <em>your</em> community, in helping the community. This becomes something of a balancing act, because you need enough involvement to not lose money doing it (for yourself and, more relevantly, that you could otherwise give to your charity), but you could host fundraisers where you match proceeds, or even not, and have signage, or a website if it was virtual, about what you're doing as a company.</p>

<p>I haven't thought much through this particular idea, but I wonder if you could also do something more long-running, where you say ""customers who've bought <em>[product]</em> are welcome to make a donation to a charity, and we'll match it up to <em>$x</em>. My hesitation lies in that it might make it a bit too much about the product, but you probably don't want to open it up to absolutely anyone.</p>

<p>To the same effect, you could also have a promise that you'll give a certain percentage of sales proceeds for ""any of our products"" to charity. That's getting a little advertisement-y for my taste, but I really don't think it's too far. I wouldn't say ""...sales proceeds to charity,"" and I would include the fact that it's for any products, because that makes people feel like they're the ones doing it, and it doesn't make it sound like you're swimming in cash as much, but that's probably me being too picky.</p>

<p>The issue, again, is that you need to make sure, with any sort of campaign, that your customer-base is going to take part enough that you raise more money than you spend on promoting it. But that's really just a matter of how many customers you have and what they do.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In general, though, I think you're probably fine to do most anything, as long as you approach it with a desire to ""set an example."" Anything you do in the name of getting more people to do good, will likely come off as a good thing to the majority.</p>

We are considering using a Selenium webdriver running server-side, with a script that populates a user's details into a test script and runs on the partners registration form, however I am open to suggestions from the agency that would undertake the project; so far though I have no takers.</p>

<p>Is it just that there is enough business in building pretty brochure apps that there is no need to undertake a challenging project or should I be looking at a totally different type of dev agency rather than an app agency? </p>

<p>Might I suggest that you try posting a listing on either UpWorks.com, Guru.com, or FreeLancer.com?

If all 4 except Zuckerberg wanted to sell, as is the popular belief, then they could have forced a sale in some way - sold critical assets, agreed to a very close partnership with Yahoo, and/or diluted Zuckerberg down over time by issuing and buying stock. These are all completely legal and above board (at least compared to what Zuckerberg et al did). Likewise they could have easily vetoed a sale with their board majority. So Zuckerberg's decision was not particularly decisive.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg is a very charismatic and influential person, he can paint work pictures to people and convince them what is ""right"" - his opinion. At that time his arguments for not selling out, was that he didn't want to be be Microsoft or part of any corporation, he just wants to bring people together and better the world, and the rest of the board agreed, as that was also the reasoning he gave when first approaching any of them, and they knew what they had gotten on board with. That kind of drive is what investors are also often looking for - someone to be passionate at what they're doing, not doing it just for the money, yet are still able to make a few bucks for them..

<p>So what is it? What are the basics of gamification? How can my website/application benefit from gamification to increase my user base, or at least make it more engaged?</p>
","<p>Gamification is the application of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology"">positive psychology</a> findings and research, mostly coming from the work of people trying to make video games better. It’s currently getting a lot of well-deserved attention for its potential for businesses. <em>Want to engage people? Learn what makes an experience engaging!</em></p>

<p>One of the key principles is imbuing something with <em>intrinsic</em> value. Most things we do (work is a prime example) have <em>extrinsic</em> value (work > money > goods/experiences > fun/feeling good). When you can make something intrinsically valuable to people, you will end up with something deeply engaging.</p>

<p>It doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> mean making a game. A lot of the best uses of gamification boil down to making something that’s normally tedious into something that holds attention and drives action.</p>

<p>There’s a lot out there that will give you a basic understanding of gamification:</p>

"What is negligence?","106","","<p>I've done a basic read-through of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence_in_employment"" rel=""nofollow"">Negligence in Employment Wiki Page</a>, yet I'm still kind of unfamiliar with what it's really conveying, especially in terms of a legal understanding.</p>

<p>What circumstances should I be wary of?</p>

<p>How do I protect against negligence as an employer (any difference between my position as an executive and my position as a founder?)?</p>

<p>Simple logic is best. Plain English is preferred over legal rambling, although I am jdero so I love additional resources if they are applicable.</p>

<p>Assume a United States software-based tech start-up for context.</p>
","<p>Your question appears to be focused on an employer's liability for acting negligently in the course of employing its workers.<sup>1</sup>  Any claimant would have to show that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You owed to them a <strong>duty of care</strong>.  Exactly when such a duty exists varies from state to state, but generally it's when one could foresee that the person might be harmed by one's conduct: duties are therefore typically owed to customers, suppliers, other employees, members of the public passing within the vicinity of the workplace, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>breached that duty</strong> of care.  The test is whether your conduct fell below the standards of a ""reasonable"" person in the circumstances, i.e. would a <em>reasonable employer</em> have acted differently?  As you can imagine, this is often the most contentious element and standards again vary from state to state.</p></li>
<li><p>Their <strong>loss was caused by that breach</strong>.  What amounts to causation again varies from state to state, but generally excludes situations where the loss would still have been suffered even if no breach had occurred; situations might also be excluded if something unforeseeable contributed to the loss after the breach.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><sup>(1) You should also be aware that employers could face other claims in negligence (for example where they entrust a dangerous instrument to a person, or where they are vicariously liable for the <em>negligence of their employees</em> who are acting in the course of their employment)&mdash;but such liability is beyond the scope of this answer.</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>So, to answer your specific questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>What circumstances should I be wary of?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to give a definitive list of such circumstances: the possibilities are endless and any list that purports to be complete would be misleading, as courts will always consider novel situations on their own merits.  Therefore it is sensible to talk only in general terms.</p>

<p>Since it's difficult to control whether you owe a duty of care or whether your actions will cause loss, it's often easiest to focus instead on avoiding any breach of duty.  In other words, you should be wary of <strong>acting other than as a reasonable employer would do</strong> in the circumstances: in particular, where it is foreseeable that an employee could inflict some loss on a person, you should be wary of failing to undertake reasonable checks before hiring them; or failing subsequently to reasonably supervise, train or terminate them.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>How do I protect against negligence as an employer (any difference between my position as an executive and my position as a founder?)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may be able to <strong>limit your liability by way of notice or contractual term</strong>.  The extent to which your liability may be excluded or limited will depend on the type of loss being covered and particular laws of the jurisdiction in which you operate&mdash;I suggest that you consult with an attorney specialising in employment law to understand what may be possible in your case.</p>

<p>However the best way to protect against such claims of negligence in employment is to <strong>have a good system of HR controls/procedures</strong>: documentation, training, review, grievance and discipline.  Clearly this is the responsibility of the business's executive management (who are <em>personally liable</em> for their negligence in addition to their employer's vicarious liability for the same act), but any investor (whether founder or not) would be foolish not to use his influence to encourage management to put in place such proper systems and controls.</p>

<p>Of course, if the business has not adopted a form that provides its founder with limited liability, he may wish to take a more hands-on approach in order to ensure that his personal risks are properly managed.</p></li>

"Where can I find private funding/lending?","106","","<p>Asides from the obvious few options with a quick google search. 
1. SBA 
2. Banks
3. Friends and Family</p>

<p>How can a person find start up monies to get a business off the ground. under 100k is not to difficult however as soon as you pass that point it is much more difficult. Is there locations where investors can find about ideas and projects and get directly in touch with the individual. </p>
","<p>First off, I'm a US citizen; the answer might be different in other countries.</p>

<p>If you're looking in the $50K to $2M range, you'd definitely be looking for <strong>angel investors</strong>.  Between $2M and $5M, it depends but that's usually too low for most <strong>venture capital (VC) firms</strong>.  $5M+ starts being VC territory.</p>

<p>Assuming you're looking below $2M then you're looking for angels.  The first rule is to remember that soliciting investment brings you into security laws, so you need be careful about who you approach and how you approach them.  If you already know the person, generally the risk is lower.  If you know the person is an ""<strong>accredited investor</strong>"", which entails some detailed criteria (generally high enough income or high enough assets), your legal risk is also lower.   The extreme form of what you cannot do is post an ad in the paper to look for people, but the usual way one can get into trouble is to openly make a pitch with people who one did not already know and who would not satisfy the accreditation rules.</p>

<p>The best place to find an angel is to look for the nearest city's angel groups, often referred to as <strong>angel funds</strong>. They are usually local accredited investors that are seeking startups or early stage companies to invest in.  Be careful though, just because they have money and are accredited doesn't mean they necessarily are good to bring into your business.  If you wouldn't hire them (i.e., you wouldn't like working with them or wouldn't bring value beyond the checkbook), then you shouldn't take their money even if they want you to -- the headaches aren't worth it.   Also be cautious that many organized angel funds nowadays try to act like VC firms with fairly one-side terms that benefit them and not you.</p>

<p>A local university's business college can often direct you to area angel funds and are very happy to do so.  They can also direct you to groups that like to advise new entrepreneurs but do not invest themselves.  These people can be invaluable to help you find investors and so are sometimes worth networking with (a process though that can take some time).</p>

<p>The major startup hubs around the country (Silicon Valley is only one of several) can also be a good place to look.   The problem of course is that if you're not local to them, they may not be as willing to invest with you.  However, getting an opportunity to pitch to one of the angel funds in their area can be a very valuable learning experience and help you connect to others.  Whenever you pitch, no matter their apparent receptivity, if they turn you down or just don't come back to you (more common), always ask them if they know of someone else who might be interested.</p>

<p>There are also several groups like the <strong>Kieretsu Forum</strong> that are essentially angel groups that you have to pay a small to substantial fee to pitch in front of.  I personally am not much of a fan of these, but they do invest and can sometimes link you to local investors in a safe manner (i.e., accredited investors).  Just don't think of that fee as an investment into getting an investor (it's not) and don't expect anything in return other than the opportunity to pitch.</p>

<p>If you do a Google search for angel investors, you will also find some groups on the Internet that show you various angel funds and sometimes can apply online directly to them..  Obviously be careful about getting involved with anyone you meet solely through the Internet (just like the rest of life), but it is a way to at least locate them and then seek them out offline.  Some have a fairly large presence, but it's best to suss that out in person.</p>

<p>You can likely also find <strong>local incubator</strong> and various startup collectives in medium and larger cities.  These will let you network and they may offer other benefits like free space.  While incubators themselves are of dubious business value, they do represent a hub that is likely to help you find angel investors.  </p>

<p>You can also consider <strong>crowdfunding</strong>, like Kickstarter and Indiegogo.  For these, you'll likely need to have a product (rather than service) in mind and usually these are for startup to early stage companies before you have much traction.  Still, raising a few hundred thousand or more does happen with these and its a cheap way to test a wider interest in your product.</p>

<p>If you have traction and are primarily interested in scaling, consider looking more for a <strong>strategic partner</strong> that could benefit from your company's business model and could potentially consider acquiring your company later.  These companies can offer immensely valuable advice and market exposure for reasonable terms.  Start by thinking of what companies your product or service could be interesting to and how your firm could act as a collaborator with.  Then you'll have to network into that company to find an actor there that could consider how your product or service could be good for them.  Investment from a strategic partner is a fantastic way to grow as long as you'd like working with them and if the terms are reasonably fair.   They often will help bring in others and set you up with a long term relationship that gives your firm more focus.  However, there are likely to only be a few candidates in any market, so you'll only have so many tries and the process can be very lengthy.  You will also find that your company's fate will be strongly to the success of this relationship, so depending on your personal motivations in starting the business, you might not find this as attractive.</p>

<p>Also realize that many businesses do not take on external investors, but end up <strong>funding themselves through revenues</strong>.  For instance, only ~2% of firms ever take VC investment and the majority do not take angel investment.   It's a slower road to be sure, but one that also has you making decisions based on what the market wants (since you depend on their revenue) and keeps you from being distracted by the always time-intensive and sometimes expensive process of attracting investors.   If you depend on investor money to keep afloat, then you may not have a sustainable (at least as it is now) business; in that case you should focus on market adoption anyway.  If you need an investor because your business is working and you want to scale it, then an investor might be a good bet.  However, if you really are taking off, you have options other than equity investment that might work for you.</p>

<p>As an alternative, don't underestimate how <strong>taking on debt</strong> at the right time can be good for your business.  If you have a steady and growing business, then debt may be a good way to fund an expansion over taking on an investor.  Obviously you need to show that you can pay off the debt but really, you have to show an investor that you're a good bet anyway.  Debt can be taken on in many forms, but convertible notes are a solution for some situations that do not depend on the more conservative bank loaning practices. </p>

<p>I hope this gives you some avenues to research for your local area to get you in touch with options that can move you along to your next step.</p>

<p>I'd like to leave you with one last thought.  This is one of my favorite articles because it shows how you can think about focusing on a business's viability without needing much capital (it assumes you're interested in starting a software business, but the lesson is suitable for even capital-intensive ventures):  <a href=""http://theteacherpreneur.com/2015/03/24/my-new-156-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theteacherpreneur.com/2015/03/24/my-new-156-startup/</a></p>

<p>The investor would give you money and you would create 233 new shares with preference.</p>

It would be nice to know the best surefire way of getting the views.</p>

<p>Also I notice a fair few projects boasting with a product review on big websites or tv shows (sky news etc) - do they get this done before hand or during the project?</p>

<p>Thanks
Ps love this helpful community</p>
","<p>Typically, crowdfunding platforms are a way to reach out to a community that you're already engaged with and ask for funding. They're not, in general, a way to reach unknown benefactors.</p>

<p>So I would be focusing on the former and enabling the latter. Talk to your community about the campaign you're planning, and get them involved. Then to enable the latter, you will want to make sure the project is sufficiently interesting and the rewards sufficiently interesting that the people you already know will be encouraged to push your campaign and their support out into their networks.</p>

<p>There are projects that break out of this expectation and get massive support from unexpected sources. These are rare, but of course they're newsworthy, so they're what we tend to fixate on. So there's no harm trying this route even when you don't have the community engagement you need to ensure success. Just be realistic. Nobody has a formula for how to get arbitrary projects crowd funded by strangers, nor could they (do the math!). Media interest will clearly do you good, and again it's a help to have built a relationship with a community if you want an interesting story that could get coverage.</p>

Also look at the fail cases, because most ventures fail, and the nature and consequences of different classes of failure (never getting traction, not hitting targets, running out of cash etc) will vary.</p>

<p>Now here's the caveat. What's rare isn't understanding exits, but creating acknowledged value for users. If there isn't a path you're burning to tread, then sometimes the best wisdom is to say - I am working towards a trade sale. The value is going to be around some multiple of a clear metric that's used in your particular space - typically revenue or profit, so if you're relying on some other factor such as users then you will want evidence that there's a market valuation for that metric. So press for those goals - which should be in your mind anyway - and you won't go far wrong.</p>

"When i should agree to give 50% to my investor?","105","","<p>As a CEO when i pitched my Startup to the investor he asked me to give 50% of my company. He agrees with my investment seek and is going to work with me as a partner. </p>

<p>But the problem is he is asking for 50%! Now he is good at business that is definite and he will work with me in making strategies and other things for company side by side. And yeah as every new startup ceo i am not familiar with business too much so should i give him my company 50% or what strategy should i apply to convince the investor for working with me on 25-30%?</p>
","<p>Unless that person is coming on board as a co-founder who is going to work the hours that a co-founder works I'd not consider their offer. I likely would not even try to negotiate, just not do business with them further. To move from 50% down to less than 10% is a negotiation that may just leave them feeling bad about the entire situation and less motivated - move on.</p>

<p>If 50% of your equity is being held by an investor then that 50% is not really doing much 'work'. Any future investor would look at your company and likely label it un-investible. This is because any future investment would immediately dilute your share of the business to below 50%. A founder with less than 50% equity is beginning to look less incentivised as their exit (amount they receive on 'sale' of the business) will be smaller. It also appears that an exit will be smaller because the business does not have enough founder equity left to do another round so the choice is sell or nothing.</p>

"How to secure funding for early product development","104","","<p>So my friend and I are developing a new board game, the long and short of it is that we need to make a rulebook, and some cardboard tiles/counters.

<p>We both do not have enough personal cash to really invest into the ideas right now, and neither do our families. We want to raise some funding to develop our product further and put together a video and a profile for a Kickstarter.</p>

<p>what would be the best way for us to get exposure and funding to develop our product?</p>
","<p>Your best bets to get some funding are in family, relatives, their relatives. Usually you'd add angel investors to this list, but the truth of the matter is they probably wouldn't invest in a board game unless you can convince them that this is the next Monopoly or Scrabble.</p>

<p>As part of getting this funding, head straight to the communities that may be interested and start interacting with your potential audience to see if your idea has any merit. In other words, go out to local board gaming clubs and play test the game with new players and a first batch of DIY board and pieces. The more positive the reactions you'll have identified, the easier it'll be for you to raise the money.</p>

<p>Try to pre-sell the idea to your earliest adopters -- e.g. have them put $30 upfront in exchange for your promise to <em>maybe</em> ship a final game in 3-12 months, ask for donations during early adopter game plays, whatever works.</p>

<p>You don't need that much cash to create a kick-starter. You need a smartphone to film a movie, a demo of the game, some copy, and a graphic designer friend's touch in exchange for buying him a dinner.</p>

"Ideas on how to monetize a startup that intends to opensource it's products?","104","","<p>I am leading a group of professionals from relevant but different industries; my role is that of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BDFL</a>; We are building a set of tools and methodologies (<a href=""http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a bit similar to this one</a>).</p>

<p>The choice of going open source is <strong>not solely because of altruism</strong>, rather it's because we believe the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It will encourage more people to contribute and develop the products</p></li>
<li><p>The geographical areas in which we intend to deploy, will mostly be developing economies - and copyright laws are (shall we say) ""not as enforceable"" over there as in the West* - in any case; We want to actively encourage use, adoption (and possible improvement) by individuals, but don't want to see commercial use without licensing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have a set of ideas of how to go about this, but I wanted to hear other ideas first, to see if I'm on the right path.</p>

<p>So, given that we want to opensource our products (mostly architectural designs and technologies for building low cost housing etc) - can someone suggest a way where we can monetize our activities? </p>

<p><strong>[[Note*]]</strong></p>

<p>It may seem I had contradicted myself when I said copyright laws were largely not enforceable in the areas in which we intend to deploy - and yet wanted to apply some sort of copyleft. What I mean however is that, I don't think it's worth hounding some poor bugger who decided to use our designs etc to build a house for himself and his family etc - they'll be too many of them to contend with in that environment, so instead, we'll encourage them to use, adapt the products and provide feedback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we keep our gunpowder dry and turn our full fury on businesses who want to ride of our coat tails and profit from our hard work. there will be fewer of those, and we can focus on dealing with them in court. </p>
","<p>Monetization is generally done by selling consolation services and support, or by a dual licensing system where your s/w is free to use for OSS/non-commercial, but has a license fee for commercial use. </p>

<p>You might also be able to sell anonymized usage statistics, or “how to” books, plans and templates and the like, or even by on-site advertising or by merchandising (T-shirts, mugs, posters, etc).</p>

<p>You could also sell parts, passing on cost savings obtained by bulk purchase and sell construction services. Even low interest micro-loans could raise funds to plough back. </p>

<p>For an altruistic endeavour, such as yours, you might also consider sponsorship (the Bill &amp; Melinda gates foundation springs to mind). </p>

"Is a pivot culture dangerous?","104","","<p>The pivot has become a popular idea with startups. Many successful pivots such as twitter and groupon have helped fuel this. I get the impression that many founders are expecting at least one pivot. Based on this they may see the initial idea as a throwaway, just a placeholder used to discover the pivot idea. Does this mentality exist and can it cause a dangerous lack of enthusiasm for the first iteration of the product?</p>
","<p>Should a business be enthusiastic about the product more than they are about the problem they are solving?</p>

<p>On the first iteration of a product you are testing how well that product solves a problem and you have very little learning/feedback to go on. There is obviously the expectation that you are going to need to change your product to respond to this feedback. </p>

<p>What's perhaps less obvious is that you're also testing your business strategy when you first release your product. The business model, as much as the product itself, should be liable to the same testing process and feedback loops.</p>

<p>Eric Ries defines a pivot as ""A change in strategy without a change in vision"". <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO5ttpuIuvg"" rel=""nofollow"">In this video, he discusses pivoting vs persevering</a>. He talks about pivoting as an inevitability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We know we're going to have to pivot. Every successful startup had to pivot along the way."" (2:57)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems what he's really saying is that a ""pivot"" is where a business implements <strong>strategic</strong> changes following feedback/learning. </p>

<p>A culture that sets itself up to pivot is one that is intentionally tracking anything that helps it validate the assumptions made in the business' strategy. I think what this culture does is re-emphases the centrality of the vision of the business and focuses people on the problem to be solved: what Ries calls the ""vision"".</p>

<p>You're right to some extent - a pivot culture can cause a lack of enthusiasm for the first iteration of a product. The product and the business strategy are both liable to change. What it also does is inspire enthusiasm for creating a business that solves problems. These cultures don't get hung up on their own assumptions. They are less likely to cause that product to ossify and they are way more likely to build something that people actually want.</p>

"What is a good business model for an open source framework?","104","","<p>When building a startup based on an popular open source framework used by many developers, what are some of the revenue options? I can think of charging for services, customization and some support. Are there other alternative models that companies are already using ?</p>

<p>The open source framework I have in mind is a Phantom.JS based automated front end testing solution.</p>
","<p>It always comes down to your value add.  You are asking customers to give up dollars in exchange for the value you provide for them.</p>

<p>That value could be as simple as doing for them something they aren't capable of doing themselves, maybe you're enabling them to get to market faster, or you are offsetting the cost of resources that they would need to hire permanently to solve a problem that might be project based.</p>

<p>From a revenue point of view, there are a couple key aspects/considerations.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it time and materials based work or fixed rate.  I.e. are you
being paid by the hour  or are you being paid a set amount?  </li>
<li>Who owns any intellectual property you create?  In theory with it being
open source, your work product will be merged back into open source project, 
but in reality, you may be paid to USE The application and not customize it.<br>
Especially in the case of libraries. </li>
<li>Pay attention to purely intellectual products like books and white papers and 
the like.  While they might not pay you a lot of money, they help build your 
reputation and credibility.</li>
<li>Look for things you can build once and re-sell over and over.  These might be 
proprietary extensions that are licensed commercially or they might be recipes
or patterns.  A good example of this is a training curriculum.  You can license 
your work product to a company like Global Knowledge which can pay you every time
they teach your class.</li>
<li>Be aware of your place in the global marketplace.  Find other experts in the platform
and partner with them.  Take their overflow, give them your overflow.  Handling things
like burst are the hardest problems for a starting up company.  This is especially
relevant for niche opportunities that are outside of your wheelhouse.  You can present
your organization as being a full service group if you have partners for fulfillment.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the flip-side, there are some things to watch out for. </p>

<ol>
<li>If you don't have a career statement of work that indicates your obligations and
the customers obligations, you can end up doing a lot more work than you expecte
and the price per engagement or price per hour may make the work invaluable.</li>
<li>Don't chase every customer.  Some customers don't have any idea how to engage in 
your services, and if you're bending yourself into a pretzel you aren't focused on 
the majority of customers out there.</li>
<li>Watch out for stale IP products.  If you do make white papers or books/etc, you've
got an implied obligation to sustain them.  Be aware of the overhead associated with
producing these if the platform is changing a lot.</li>

"Amicably part ways with co founders who don't do their job?","103","","<p><em>Background:</em><br>
So we're 4 people trying to do something of our own. The 3 are friends who look after marketing and I am the new developer addition. We met in Feb and ever since, we've been working together on just-for-fun projects, most of which were just their ideas to ""test the depths"" of the market (and make money if they turned out to be good). I was left to do the research and development. </p>

<p>My pay all through out this time? Zero. My work? Everything from developing, testing, and post-release maintenance.  </p>

<p>How did we sustain so far? I got a client on my own, made something for them, and made money. This money is being used to fund the current project.  </p>

<p>What's their involvement in current project? Zero. (Just one of 'em paid for a tech conference we went to to meet potential users and to forward <em>their</em> vision of the company. This didnt help the current project a bit.) I do everything from research, reaching out to potential users, potential investors, etc. on top of my developer responsibilities.  </p>

<p>They want to end this as just another fun project, I see a genuine potential. So, there's a rift. I want to part ways.   </p>

<p>Also, they work ""part-time"" in this, I work full time. </p>

<p><em>Questions:</em>  </p>

<ol>
<li>What's their stake in this?  </li>
<li>What's an amicable way to part ways?  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>PS: I'd be happy to add more details on request.</em> </p>
","<p>TL;DR: Get a new cofounder who can actually get deals and investors in, and don't give more than a moment of thought about how your current cofounders feel about it. (Tip: <em>do</em> <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/3666/is-it-feasible-to-launch-an-app-working-alone"">get a cofounder</a>.)</p>

<p>It sounds like you're extremely irritated by the non-value of your three ""idea guys"" cofounders. Time to part indeed.</p>

<p>Give them a polite ""Guys, I've been doing nearly everything here for the past X months. And I've been full time on this, while you've been only part-time. It's not fair, and I'm not seeing the value you've been contributing to date. I'll be happy moving forward with one or more of you if I get a full-time commitment and something useful and valuable out of it. But so far I haven't, and if I don't see it quickly, let's call it a day and I'll do it my own way. Oh, and we need to revisit the terms of our arrangement with whoever stays."" (And make sure you get something worth your time.)</p>

<p>Don't worry too much about hurting feelings, and stop humping their legs. If you're really feeling the way you seem to do right now, the main value they're providing is bouncing ideas off of you while hoping you'll make it happen. Ideas are a dime a dozen, and ideas without execution are simply <em>worthless</em>. (What's that? Did you mention you were executing <em>everything</em> to date? Why are these free-riders still even around? Wake up! They should have been dumped <em>ages</em> ago.)</p>

<p>Point is, do part ways. There are multiple ways to do so. Which you can do will depend on your founder agreement - assuming you have any. If you don't then just walk away and create a separate business with the cofounders who are willing to play on your terms. (Oh, and you most assuredly do NOT want whoever stays to hold the CEO helm. Make them CFO, Head of Sales, or Head of Marketing as relevant. And hold them accountable.) It also helps to have vested stock for cofounders. 1-year cliff minimum so as to be able to give the boot to those who don't pull their weight worth of salt.</p>

"Is ""Date Founded"" a Legacy Statistic for Startups?","103","","<p>I recently asked <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/796/date-founded-for-a-product-revival"">this question</a>, about fair use of a founding date that doesn't <em>really</em> apply to a product revival, and that got me curious: how much does ""date founded"" even matter any more?</p>

<p>It's not like we visit facebook.com and see a banner that reads ""Since 2004!"" In fact, you don't even go to Hotmail and see ""Founded 1996,"" which, to me at least, seems like a pretty impressive factoid.</p>

<p>Clearly it still matters in many service industries, but is founding date irrelevant in the tech world? When the whole industry is moving forward to really review the past, maybe listing a founding date is actually a bad thing for marketing? Maybe users even associate an old company with old designs and ideas?</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not talking about companies that have had the same software out for twenty years, where their philosophies might actually <em>be</em> outdated. I'm asking about two otherwise-identical business models and products, one of which is labelled with a founding date and the other is not.</p>
","<p>Those claims are certainly not as prominent with your average tech company, there's no denying that.</p>

<p>So is that because the average tech company isn't all that old, or because it isn't relevant anymore? Or both?</p>

<p>I think, as you mentioned in your question, that a lot of it has to do with how quickly the tech industry is moving and evolving. But to leave it there would oversimplify what's going on and I don't think it automatically means there's no value in saying how long you've been around (but we might need to say it a bit differently).</p>

<p>There is still room for trusted brands.</p>

<p>That's what all of this boils into is brand trust. The ""established 1979"" logo is meant to build trust. But it is just one factor in how brands earn our trust, and how we attribute that trust is evolving.</p>

<p>This seems to be even more true of the software/web development side of the tech industry vs the hardware side. And I think part of that is because it is much easier for a small team to band together, create a nice app, and get some funding to finish developing and market it than it is to bring a cell phone to market for instance.  As more and more startups with funding from unknown venture capitalists successfully bring quality products/services to market, people will become more and more accustomed to interacting with brands they're not familiar with.</p>

<p>You do still see instances of ""We were the ORIGINAL X"" or ""We were the first to X"", but the tendency is more to say, ""We're the new kids on the block and we're going to rock your world by doing something you've never seen before! Forget about that company you've been working with since 1996.""</p>

<p>On the hardware side, I watched part of Apple's live streaming of their big iPhone 6 event and on their website they were plugging the fact that they had invented the computer mouse (as well as several other innovations mostly focused on user input and leading into a special knob on their watch - they call it a ""digital crown"").  So it was kind of an interesting blend of ""Hey we've been around forever, but we've been innovating the whole time and we're doing it again!""  Trying to get the best of both worlds going there - which I think if you're in a position to do so is the best way to go about this.</p>

<p>Here's why they're in a position for it to work.  Apple has not only been around for almost 40 years, they have a history of creating products that have earned people's trust (whether you like Apple or not, they have earned earned people's trust).  If they had a competitor that had been around for the same period of time but hadn't done anything noteworthy during that time, it wouldn't do that competitor much good to say ""Established 1976"".</p>

<p>But even if someone had never heard of Apple before, but they see Apple say, ""We invented the computer mouse!"" that tells them that Apple has been around for quite a while AND they have a history of innovation.  It doesn't necessarily have to be innovation, but it has to be something noteworthy that resonates with the customer or it won't do much to build trust.</p>

<p>Where it really gets interesting is with some of these mega-corporations that everyone is familiar with but they actually have somewhat negative reputations and because of that they actually do very little to tie some of their assets back to their brand even though the brand has ""been around"" for some time.  Like the example you gave of Facebook. Nobody trusted Instagram anymore when FB bought it. In fact, when Facebook released their Messenger app a couple months ago, the internet was consumed with suspicion over what evil thing they were trying to do and millions of people were talking about how insanely invasive the new app's permission requests were - few stopped to realize that the permissions were almost identical to the original FB app as well as almost every other app they likely have installed on their phone.  And there was a fair amount of discontent among the Kickstarter community when Facebook bought the Occulus Rift.  When that gets to market, I doubt you'll see a ""Product of Facebook, Inc. est. 2004"" sticker on the box. They'll be better off keeping the brands separate.</p>

<p>One of my businesses which is somewhat in the tech startup space (sort of a hybrid I guess) now controls another company that has been around for about 14 years.  That company isn't a tech company, so it's not as directly tied to this issue, but you can bet we'll keep talking about the fact that the company has been around for a while now. But the company has also been building a quality reputation during that 14 year period, so that makes it worth talking about.</p>

<p>Hopefully that isn't too un-focused I was trying to cover multiple angles without wandering too much.  What it really boils down to is this: 
Brands need trust. 
How we as consumers attribute that trust is changing.
Which means brands have to change how they earn trust from new customers encountering their brand.
The ""est. 1904"" type claims still carry value, but they too must evolve. Rather than just stating a date, talk about what you've done in those years - things the customer will care about.</p>

<p>A couple other quick points:</p>

<p>What market you're in will definitely make a difference. If you're building a webapp to help people manage their money, you probably need a higher level of trust than if you're offering a free email account. If your customers are businesses rather than consumers, you may also have to work harder to earn trust.</p>

<p>If you can't say, ""We've been around 20 years and look at all the cool things we've done as a company,"" there may still be a similar claim you can make. I've seen a lot of smaller companies tally up the number of years their employees and owners have in the industry and say, ""Together, we've got 127 years of experience, and here are some of the cool projects we've been a part of throughout the years.""  For some reason the Mythbusters are the first people to come to mind, but at the beginning of their show it says, ""Together they've got X years of experience."" And I think it said that during their first season - to help build trust for their new brand.</p>

<p>There's so many different facets to this discussion and it's hard to keep myself from running off in any one direction, and there's plenty more that could be said but I think this gives a pretty good summary of my view of the state of the relationship between our culture and brand trust as it relates specifically to the type of claim you're talking about.</p>

","<p>The question of the name is likely answered by looking at the target market for your app and what message you'd like to name to project to potential users.  A catchy name is all fine and well, but it shouldn't be the deciding factor in your ultimate choice.  Remember that ALL of your marketing is going to include the use of your name in some form or fashion, so the name you choose will have a substantial impact on how you market it going forward.
So ask yourself, what do you think would flow in being memorable to prospective customers and at the same time help you create an overall brand identity that will be your image to the world.  These are questions that you should be able to answer if you've done your homework.  <strong>Writing</strong> an app is only the first small part of the puzzle : you need to know who you want to reach, what appeals to them, and what would give your brand ""stickiness"" (something easy to remember) in your audience's mind.  If they don't buy (or start using your app) right away, being a name they can identify with and perhaps has some nexus to the market it serves can make all the difference in whether they come back later and become customers.  This is just some food for thought.</p>

<p>The company had been setup with the ""Slicing the Pie"" equity distribution model, and after hundreds and hundreds of hours contributed, I had approx. 12% equity built up. </p>

<p>After a particularly egregious email from the CEO, I announced that I'd be stepping down. I met with the CEO who seemed perfectly happy with my departure and we made an agreement that I would be a silent partner going forward. My equity would not be touched, it would simply dilute as my contributions halted going forward. I would however have an equal vote on all decisions impacting my equity (taking on capital, selling, changing structure, etc).</p></p>

<p>A couple of weeks later, I lost access to company accounts that I'd been told I'd be able to keep. I reached out and after many, many attempts, the CEO apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. A couple of weeks later, I noticed that I was unable to access the file tracking our equity split. Again, after many, many attempts, I finally got an email saying that the group voted to vacate my equity entirely.</p>

<p>The argument is that I left without good reason and my time was therefor valued at zero. Now, the company is currently not profitable. But when/if they do become profitable, I believe that my (diluted) stake should be recognized.</p>

<p>After a conversation with the partners, it is clear that they have no intention of honoring our agreement (which they do not deny exists but was not on paper). There is no exit clause one way or another in our partnership agreement. There is significant documentation about my hourly contributions on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>The questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognizing that there's no current value to the stake, what can I do
to fight back? Obviously, hiring an attorney would be more costly than it might be worth. </li>
<li>Acknowledging that someone is going to say ""just move on,"" what are my legal obligations when communicating about the business itself. If I have no financial stake in the company, can I publicly attack them?</li>
<li>If I wanted to file a claim against them, how should I do it?</li>
</ul>
","<p>For one I've never heard of shareholders being able to just ""vote off"" another's equity like they did. But them, if you've no agreements or anything specific from them in writing, and kept no copies of the related communications, well... things aren't rosy either. (Then again, you <em>do</em> have an ""email saying that the group voted to vacate my equity entirely"" which, technically, is documentation that you could use against them.)</p>

<p>Methinks you've three sensible options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bite the bullet and just move on - life's too short to fight jerks in court.</li>
<li>Ask a lawyer on how to proceed next and fight immediately - a stressful option.</li>
<li>Double-check with a lawyer for a second opinion, then do nothing in the immediate and go after them if/when they're actually profitable. (As happened <a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/04/13/facebooks-complicated-ownership-history-explained/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">to Facebook</a>.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming your lawyer thinks it can work out (IANAL), that last option might be in your best interest. Because on their end they could very well shut things down and start anew if you become too big a distraction, with you potentially owning a piece of something worth nothing. By contrast, if you let them get big enough that they can no longer easily reboot, and <em>then</em> expose how they're naked at the worst of moments, they'll more likely be willing to write a check to get you off of their back.</p>

<p>(Also, in case the situation arises because of due diligence while raising funds: do not, under any circumstances, sign a document wherein you agree that you've no further claims on the company without getting a lawyer involved.)</p>

"How much can I be diluted by a self-funding founder?","102","","<p>This is a secondary question to ""<a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/11398/how-unusual-is-it-to-not-be-told-how-many-shares-of-a-company-are-outstanding"">How unusual is it to not be told how many shares of a company are outstanding?</a>"". As I said there, I work for a startup which is self-funded by a wealthy founder. For a few years before we received external investment, we presumably received injections of cash from the founder to keep the company running. During this time, the fair market value of our shares remained at a few cents. Should I assume that each time the founder injected cash into the company, the equivalent number of shares (new investment / fair market value) was created, thus diluting all other shareholders? Or put another way, can I calculate a rough upper bound on the number of shares the founder owns by taking all our spending prior to external investment and dividing by the fair market value of the shares?</p>

<p>I realize that as a shareholder, the short answer is to just ask the company to open their books. But the company is extremely secretive and I imagine I'd have to file a lawsuit to get the information, which would put me in a tough position as a current employee.</p>
","<p>Unless you know <em>exactly</em> how the founder invested his money in the company, you may never have an answer to your question.  </p>

<p>It's possible he didn't take additional shares in the company, but rather he might have given the money to the company in the form of a loan, to be repaid with (or without) interest at some future point in time.  </p>

<p>He may have issued different classes of shares for his additional investment too so that he has preferred shareholder status in the event the company doesn't survive as a going concern.  With preferred shares, he'd be the first in line to receive repayment if there's any money left after liquidation and settlement of the company's outstanding debts.  This, of course, assumes there <em>is</em> anything left in the event of a failure, which there usually isn't.</p>

<p>All things being what they are, why not just <em>ask</em> him to explain the structure and ownership of the company to everyone?  I can't imagine you having to file a lawsuit to get what you're asking for, and if there's retaliation because you dared to ask then that's potentially grounds for another suit.</p>

<p>As a shareholder, you have <em>rights</em> to know the company's financial condition and what the distribution of ownership is.  </p>

<p>To your question about how far down you can be diluted, there's no limit short of zero.  In other words, you can't lose the shares you have, but so many could be issued that your percentage ownership could have a decimal place followed by more than a few zeroes before getting to a number value.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to contact the secretary of state's office in the state where the company was formed and ask them what means you have for learning what it is you want to know.  You can keep your questions open and general without having to specifically identify the company so it can't become an issue, but the state will certainly tell you what you can and can't do to find out what you want to know.</p>

","<p>Technically, the percentage of ownership and control do not have to be in sync; how this is done is really another topic/question in my opinion.</p>

<p>As for your question, clearly all investors want to be in control, but that's not always an option for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>My experience is that the average investor would be less concerned about control, and more concerned that the incentive for employees to commit to the success of the company would be threatened by you retaining such a large percentage of the company.</p>

"What is a stock? Why do people buy them? Or do they?","102","","<p>I hear a lot about this, but don't have any idea about it. Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>Edit for additional clarity: The context here is <em>stock</em> as it relates to <em>ownership</em> in a corporation.</p>
","<p>A <strong><em>stock</em></strong> is a fraction of ownership in a company.</p>

<p>People who own stock are called <strong><em>shareholders</em></strong>. The amount of stock owned by a shareholder is quantified by a number of <strong><em>shares</em></strong> which is usually a <em>counting number</em> or <em>positive integer</em> (but not always as fractional shares are sometimes, though rarely, seen).</p>

<p>The total number of shares owned by all shareholders represents 100% ownership of the company.</p>

<p>Shareholders purchase stock in order to earn a return on their investment of capital. This happens one of two ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The share price will change over time. If the share price goes up and the investor sells at a higher price than they paid then their <strong><em>profit</em></strong> (a/k/a <strong><em>gain</em></strong> or <strong><em>capital gain</em></strong>) is the difference between their purchase price and their sale price. (If the price declined, then their <strong><em>loss</em></strong> a/k/a <strong><em>capital loss</em></strong> is the same difference.)</p></li>
<li><p>The company can, and often does, make cash payments to shareholders called <strong><em>dividends</em></strong>. These funds come from either a share of the profits earned by the company during the time period since they last paid dividends or, alternatively, from <strong><em>retained earnings</em></strong> (money the company earned prior to the last issuance of dividends that the company had <em>retained</em> and not yet distributed to shareholders).</p></li>

"What to use to protect web startup: (R) or TM/SM","102","","<p>What to use to protect the rights on commercial web startup including it's property, such as domain names, dissemination of names&amp;designations: registred trademarks (R) or unregistred ones (TM/SM)?</p>

<p>Since the trademark designations like TM and SM are even free, don't require any registration process and appear the tools to protect a startup from commercial side as well as expensive registred trademark (R), what case I need to use registred trademarks instead of unregistred?</p>

<p>What would be the best trademark protection approach for the web startup ""Example Ltd."" to protect this on 100% of following structure:</p>

<p><strong>example.com</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>ExampleTea</p></li>
<li><p>ExampleCoffee</p></li>

</ul>

<p>where're all child services should to have the shared brand <strong>ExampleTeam</strong>? Can I use TM for each child service and SM for <strong>ExampleTeam</strong> brand without  registring each one as (R) trademark and to be sure that everything ok?</p>
","<p>You're right, trademark registration isn't <em>necessary.</em></p>

<p>Registering a trademark, however, does give you a couple advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>More damages</strong>: If you sue someone for infringing on your trademark, you're more likely to get, for instance, legal fees covered, if your trademark is registered.</li>
<li><strong>National claim</strong>: Using an unregistered mark in trade gives you some protection locally, since someone else who comes up and tries to use it on a similar classification won't be able to, but by registering with the federal government, you're able to move easily into other states without having to worry that <em>other people</em> will stop you from using it. You won't necessarily be able to stop them, but at least your website won't simply be banned from some state.</li>
<li><strong>Announcing yourself</strong>: Speaking a position that not everyone is filled with malice, there are a ton of brands out there, so if someone thinks of your brilliant name for themselves and does the best search available to them to find whether it's been used, it's nice to show up in the federal Trademark database.</li>
<li><strong>Substantial claim</strong>: Along the same lines as a national claim, once your trademark has been registered for five years, it's presumed valid. In other words, they figure you probably have a good claim to it. At that point, it's extremely difficult to have it cancelled by a competitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, none of those are necessary. If you aren't worried that people will try and steal your brand, you don't need to ""insure"" for more damages, if you aren't looking to enter several states or your name is <em>just that revolutionary</em>, you don't need a national claim over it, and if you aren't worried about people starting something with your name (particularly since you already own the domain), you don't need to announce yourself.</p>

<p>But that said, it sounds like you do want some of that protection, with good reason.</p>

<p>Just a quick paragraph, in case you didn't know: the purpose of a trademark is to protect consumers who may be confused about the source of a product. An example I've heard and tend to give on here is if I started a fancy restaurant called McDonald's: people would come to me expecting cheap food and get frustrated, and people would go to the fast food restaurant expecting grade-A steak, and probably not be too happy either.</p>

<p>So the number one priority in this is to trademark the brand, since that's what it's there to do. If you're selling things under the name ExampleTeam, I'd probably register that one, then just TM the others.</p>

<p>Remember that your business name is already protected <em>in your state</em>, so whether that's important or not is really just a matter of whether you're using that name somewhere that you wouldn't be okay with someone in another state jumping in on.</p>

<p>As a general rule with intellectual property, you just have to decide where on the scale you want to fall:</p>

<pre><code>Protection -----------------------------------------------------------------------Economics
</code></pre>

<p>If you want lots of protection, you'll get advantages, but it'll cost you. The cost of a trademark registration may be miniscule in comparison to the potential losses, in which case go for it. If it isn't, then just go for the main brands in your collection.</p>

"Good readings for a CEO/CTO to grasp basic CFO notions","101","","<p>Nowadays more and more startups kickstart with a strong technical knowledge base.
Sometimes the common scenario includes a low, if not completely absent, finance knowledge.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about basic economy/financial knowledge that impact business plans. 
Is more about having a big picture of the growth process in the mid/long run.Talking about funding, IPOs, stocks admin, forex.</p>

<p>From a tech-CEO/CTO point of view, I do believe is important to have a rough understanding.
What would you suggest as a good reading? What pitfalls to look after?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>Generally the CFO's are 'Financial Management' subject matter experts. So, look for a good book on that subject, look for an edx course (there are 126 courses at the moment, most of them are free and from accredited universities- <a href=""https://www.edx.org/courses?search_query=financial+management"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.edx.org/courses?search_query=financial+management</a>) or look for articles on the subject that FM covers. FM is a big subject that covers a diverse set of topics including</p>

<ul>
<li>Capital structures</li>
<li>Raising and managing short and long term financing</li>
<li>leasing, IPOs, convertible notes</li>
<li>Evaluating cost of financing</li>
<li>Planning and forecasting</li>
<li>Regulations (sarbanes-oxley act, GAAP, etc) and ethics (case study a company like Enron)</li>
<li>Financial risk analysis and scenario analysis</li>
<li>Mergers, divestitures, leverages buyouts, holdings</li>
<li>Working capital management</li>
</ul>

<p>Brigham and Ehrhardt's Financial Management Theory and Practice is one of the standard textbooks used in formal FM courses</p>

<p>If you are coming from a tech background, it wouldn't hurt to know some management accounting and some financial accounting as well. Management accounting covers topics like budgeting, capital management, cost and overheads. While financial accounting covers the staples of the bean counting world such as the income statements, cash flow statements and the famous balanced sheet. If you are a CEO, you would at least have to know how to read these. Getting a couple of dummies book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1118116429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Managerial-Accounting-Dummies-Mark-Holtzman/dp/1118116429</a> and <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470930659"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Financial-Accounting-Dummies-Maire-Loughran/dp/0470930659</a> might be a good idea.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that if you are the CEO, you would be expected to talk to and understand the people who report to you. So you should be able to at least understand the basics of financial management and accounting, technology and product development, sales and marketing, HR and administration and customer service and support etc.</p>

<p>If the CEO does not understand it, then usually that area tends to get neglected and the person in charge of that department either has a tough time trying to bring important matters to the CEO's attention or may take advantage. So in order to be effective, know what you don't know and have a plan to learn the basics. This is partly why some young CEOs get mentors/friends from these fields. </p>

<p>Crowdfunding campaign backers are a bit like VCs. They invest in the idea, of course. But they primarily invest in the team -- meaning you. They'll want to know about you, about who you are, about how passionate you are, about your story, about why you can succeed, etc. Without any online or social media presence, you're setting yourself up to fail, plain and simple.</p>

<p>As such, you really need to suck it in, create your website, create a list, create the requisite accounts on whatever social media is useful in your niche, and start getting social online. We're in a celebrity economy -- accept it.</p>

"Why did Silicon Valley become Silicon Valley?","101","","<p>I've heard a number of explanations, most having to do with World War II, though not 100% sure these are historically true. Why did Silicon Valley become Silicon Valley?</p>
","<p>Endeavor Insight released <a href=""http://share.endeavor.org/pdf/HDSVBSV.pdf"">an interesting report on this earlier this year.</a></p>

<p>I'll attempt to distill the ~20 page document into some key details:</p>

<p>The man commonly known for coining the term ""Silicon Valley"" in 1971 is a journalist named Don Hoefler (not the first to use it, but the first to use it widely in print). And when it is all boiled back, the region was chosen by one of the nobel prize winning inventors of the transistor.</p>

<p>William Shockley was looking to start a company producing transistors. And after looking at the cities known for producing electronics, he instead decided to move to the area he'd grown up and started his business in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>His initial hurdle was fining talent to work for him. There wasn't any in the area because all the people trained in working with semiconductors had jobs somewhere else or were going to school somewhere else. So he started calling up people working in the industry across the country and eventually gathered 8 hand-picked people to work for him.</p>

<p>Turns out Shockley sucked as a boss so they all quit (I think it was even the same day?). His company eventually failed and these 8 specialists were now out looking for a job hoping to market themselves as a group that would be valuable to hire together due to their experience. </p>

<p>A banker told them they needed to think bigger - get funding and start their own gig.  After all, they were hand selected by one of the inventors of the semiconductor - with his poor management skills out of the way, they may have a shot at doing something great!</p>

<p>They got connected with a serial entrepreneur named Fairchild and with this new source of funding (and industry connections) they started Fairchild Semiconductor.</p>

<p>The business exploded as they took on new contracts including one for the Minuteman missile program in 1959.  </p>

<p>Eventually as they grew they began creating spin-off companies. Employees left to start microchip companies or companies to manufacture glass components needed for semiconductors. And rather than trying to hang on to these employees, they were encouraged and supported in these other ventures.</p>

<p>By the time Hoefler wrote about the region over 30 companies had been started as a result of Fairchild Semiconductor. And apparently all but 2 local chip firms could be tied back to those 8 co-founders in some way.</p>

<p><em>So why did Silicon Valley become what it is today?</em> <strong>Because while William Shockley sucked at managing a team, he was apparently exceptional at choosing one.</strong></p>

I have met several other students also interested in startups and they are mainly studying business administration or related fields.</p>

When I was seen as an intellectual equal before when exchanging ideas, I am now suddenly treated a tool that can implement their grand ideas for them. My input from then on seems to be disregarded and they only focus on my technical knowledge.</p>

<p>Did other co-founders in tech fields have similar experiences when communicating with possible co-founders from business related fields? </p>

<p>Have I only met people I don't have any synergy with as a co-founder or can someone give me advice to be seen as a more equal co-founder?</p>
","<p>To be honest, even if this is a really personal question, due to specific geolocation / network /etc, I must admit that the situation you mention is not completely unknown in other environments.</p>

<p>Stepping back for a second, let's think what looking for a co-founder means.
Personally I think you don't want just to duplicate your knowledge or find someone that can backup your role when needed. You want someone complementary to you. You see the additional value in having someone else co-founding something with you.</p>

<p>Now, back to your situation, the chance is that they don't have any CS knowledge, and they see in you the missing piece to their idea. Somehow is the mirror situation of yours.
Given that you don't want to be ""just"" a CTO, you should try to reposition yourself in the early stage of the conversation. 
Something like ""I studied/ing  CS but i'm interested in founding a startup and focus on the business development rather than technical implementation"".
You may want to try to find co-founder within the CS field. In this way would be easier for you to shift towards more the business side and reposition yourself.</p>

"does this kind of international money transferring exist? if it does, then is it legal and safe?","100","","<p>I have just come up an idea of international money transferring. </p>

<p>Let see this example, Tom i living in Australia. Tam is living in Thailand. </p>

<p>Tom has AUD in his bank account in Australia.</p>

<p>Tam has Thai Baht in his bank account in Thailand.</p>

<p>Now, Tom wants to go to Thailand &amp; open a business there, so he needs a lot of Thai Baht for his business in Thailand. </p>

<p>Tam wants to go to Australia to study medicine. So he also needs quite a lot of AUD for his study.</p>

<p>OK, If Tom and Tam transfer their money from their own country to oversea, then it will be very costly. They gotta pay for the transferring fee, currency converter. It also takes pretty long time to receive.</p>

<p>SO, here is my solution. I will create a website that helps Tom and Tam to achieve their goals without having to transfer their money internationally. All they do is to login my website. </p>

<p>There will have a list of people who want to do the deals in the website. In this list, each person will say how much money they have in their own country &amp; how much money they want to have in other country.</p>

<p>This is the list:</p>

<pre>
Person - Money Having in that person's Country - Money that person want to have in other country

Tom    - 5000 AUD                              - 100000 Thai Baht
Tam    - 100000 Thai Baht                      - 5000 AUD
</pre>  

<p>So now Tom and Tam saw the list and they can do the deal. Tom already arrived in Thailand &amp; open a Thai bank account there &amp; Tam already arrived in Australia and open an Australian bank account there.</p>

<p>Then Tom has 5000 AUD in Australian bank account &amp; Tam has 100000 Thai Baht in Thai bank account.</p>

<p>Tom does the online banking and transfer 5000 AUD from his  Australian bank account to Tam's Australian bank account.</p>

<p>Tam does the online banking and transfer 100000 Thai Baht from his Thai bank account to Tom's Thai bank account.</p>

"How to find work for idle development capacity","100","","<p>I know a team of developers who aren't happy being employed. They would rather instead try to manage themselves. They have a good-sized capacity and they are flexible with technology (although not extremely proficient in anything in particular). I am interested in learning the sales model - how can someone market their capacity? As there is obviously lots of money in IT right now, judging by the salaries.</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe they should pick a hot technology, produce a high quality product, make it available for free in order to gain reputation and then leverage on this reputation to advertise on google?</p>

","<p>'Generalists' are very hard to sell. Don't try to sell their skills as jack of all trades, or even just Java/C++/Python developers. You'd be forcing yourself to compete against a bigger field, including off-shore development, and small Elance teams.</p>

"Directors duties vs dividends when director is also a shareholder","99","","<p>According to <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/directors-responsibilities"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>, one of the basic director duties is to <strong>make decisions for the benefit of the company, not yourself</strong>. How does it work when a director is also a shareholder and decides to pay a dividend? Obviously he is acting for his own benefit.</p>
","<p>The word ""company"" (like ""companions"") refers to people who ""come together"" (or <em>associate</em>&mdash;hence memorandum/articles of <em>association</em>) for a common purpose.  In other words, <strong>a company <em>is</em> its members</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus a director's duty to act in the best interests of the ""company"" simply means that <strong>he must act in its <em>members'</em> best interests</strong> (as opposed to his own, or anyone else's).</p>

<p>A <em>limited</em> company is the same, only the members' liability for acts that are undertaken toward the common purpose is limited by law (in the case of companies limited by shares, <strong>the members are called ""shareholders""</strong> and their liability is limited to any amounts unpaid on their called-up share capital).  Sure, we have created the fiction that such companies are incorporeal ""people"" capable of owning property and contracting in their own name; and we have developed legislation to protect third parties from abuse&hellip; but nonetheless a director's duties toward the company still refers to his duties towards its members.</p>

<p>Therefore the dichotemy that you highlight in your question is easily resolved by understanding that the duty on a director who is also a shareholder is only to ensure that decisions are <strong>in the interests of <em>all</em> shareholders</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Decisions to pay dividends cannot normally constitute a breach of this duty</strong> because, by definition, they're paid to all shareholders (unless there are multiple classes of share); contrast with a decision to pay a director's bonus.  However, if the director decided to declare a dividend solely because he personally needed some cash and in doing so the business is put at risk, it could be argued that he has breached his fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of <em>all</em> shareholders.</p>

<p>That said, <strong>decisions to pay dividends are usually approved by the shareholders</strong> in general meeting&mdash;in which case the decision is effectively taken by the members themselves rather than the directors.  It could still be argued that merely <em>recommending</em> a dividend in circumstances such as those above could constitute a breach of duty, but I think that's probably going beyond the scope of this question.</p>

"How do out of state taxes work for online businesses?","99","","<p>My business is currently incorporated in New Hampshire, but we may open an office in Massachusetts. We develop mobile apps and all of our revenue comes from online through the app store. What taxes would we be liable for in Massachusetts? Would we have to pay an income or business tax, or just taxes related to the property (which would be rented)?</p>
","<p>Your liability in Massachusetts is not just determined by whether you use property there, but also whether you hire employees there, or even work regularly from there.</p>

<p>Generally, before one of these events occurs, you will have to officially register as a business in the additional state.  If you are a corporation this will mean registering as a foreign corporation, but even if you're an LLC or sole proprietor you may have to at least register the business name.  Your tax liability will be not just property taxes but sales tax, income, and other franchise taxes.  Besides tax liability, you should watch out for additional insurance requirements (e.g. do you need to buy workmen's compensation in the new state?).</p>

<p>Once you're qualified to do business in multiple states, you must apportion your income among the various states correctly.  This usually comes down to using a formula from UDITPA, the <a href=""http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/uditpa/uditpa66.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act</a>.

To accept credit card payments, I need a business entity formed. Let's say, I start with a DBA, and when I decide that it's time to scale - I move to LLC or Corp (which one to chose is not a question at the moment).

"To join a startup as the technology specialist with the goal of being the CTO","99","","<p>I have just been offered to join a startup as the technical expert with the idea of me becoming the CTO.</p>

<p>We are to have another meeting to discuss details.</p>

<p>None of the co-founders are technical. What I would like to understand more is the following suggestion made to me: ""We want you to start with the ownership of the technological solution, say 1 day's work per week, and grow into the role as CTO"".</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not accept ""growing into"" a CTO role part-time. Either there are clear requirements from the start what the CTO will be responsible for, or you are better off walking away.</li>
<li>If there is no budget from the start, that shows that the business owners are simply not that business-minded, and hence, another reason to walk away.</li>

<p>Do you want to be CTO? because if you are not sure about the scope, you should not agree to an appointment.</p>

<p>If you know the idea that they are working on, you may do your own research and update them about the amount of work required. For example</p>

"When should I start waiting on new technology?","99","","<p>I have a family friend who's been thinking about getting some software written, and he wants me to write it. It's a pretty serious job, and he already has some investors lined up to fund it. He's been thinking and talking about it for a few months, and it isn't the ""rush to market and beat everyone else"" kind of startup, any more than any other startup is.</p>

<p>I'm a .NET web developer, so I've been eagerly awaiting the release of the next version of ASP.NET vNext, <a href=""http://www.asp.net/vnext"">ASP.NET 5</a>. It's in preview right now and I'm happy not touching it until it RTMs, which I understand should be happening ""pretty soon.""</p>

<p>At what point is it reasonable to delay a project for an upcoming release of this nature?</p>

<p>I don't care to get into many details, since this isn't even limited to this release of ASP, or .NET in general, but ultimately this is the next major-version release, and with that, it has a lot of new and exciting cloud features, and some better support for scenarios that I deal with day-to-day.</p>

<p>I figure if I start this project right now on the current version of ASP, I'll be stuck dealing with upgrading soon, and since this is a major release, they aren't promising anything about that to be a clean and easy change. I'll have to upgrade some other software, but it seems a waste to spend what could turn into maybe a few weeks on this, then have to spend another week upgrading. On the other hand, if I wait a few weeks and it doesn't come out, then another few weeks pass, and another, then it would be worth it.</p>

I have registered trademark <code>A</code> in an EU country. I presume I'll run into problems down the road if I sell my product in the US (webservice), even if my trademark is registered in another country. Is that correct?</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Yes, that's most likely correct.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm not completely sure what you mean by a ""local trademark."" Do you mean a state trademark, or ""local"" to the federal United States?</p>

<p>Speaking federally, as is typically the case with web services, chances are, you wouldn't want to come in with the same name.</p>

<p>Barring exceptions (which I'll speak to next), you'll be dealing with a whole new trademark, and all of the scrutiny involved in getting that.</p>

<h1>What are the exceptions?</h1>

<p>There are a couple exceptions to that, but I don't imagine either applies here.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You did something with a treaty:</strong> If you were the first to file (as in, you filed yours before the US person filed theirs), and you filed with the <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/trademarks/en/treaties.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trademark Treaties</a>, then you might be able to carry your trademark overseas and use it here. Of course, again, you'd have to have been first, and you'd have to have made that decision within the first six months or so of having your trademark.</li>
<li><strong>You're famous:</strong> If you have a famous mark, you could hold some stake in it even if it wasn't registered everywhere you intended to use it. Of course, that's really for companies like Microsoft, NIKE, Sony, and other giants or ""household names"" like that, and they probably don't have a lot of questions relating to <a href=""http://startups.stackexchange.com"">Startups</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If their trademark is at a state level and you're not looking to enter their state, ever, then it should be fine, although you probably won't be able to get a federal trademark on top of theirs. I still wouldn't suggest it, for sake of the (what I believe to be well-intentioned) spirit of the law, but you shouldn't have any direct problems.</p>

<p>Of course, knowing whether you have any ""direct problems"" is really the job of a licensed attorney, and not some guy on the internet who's three sentences of your situation, so if you plan on going for it, I'd suggest speaking with a professional and going over what your business is, what the competition's is, and all that good stuff.</p>

<h1>A bit about trademarks...</h1>

<p>In my opinion, trademarks are <em>typically</em> a force for good in the world (typically, I should say that again). If you find issue selling your product because of someone else's trademark over which you have no claim, there's probably a good reason for that.</p>

<p>The idea of trademarks is to protect consumers from confusion--if I see a logo or brand-name, I can comfortably expect a certain level of quality, for better or worse, from the product.</p>

<p><em>That speaks, by the way, to the goal of the second point above. If you live in a small country and you've heard all these good things about NIKE products and suddenly you see knockoffs of them coming into stores near you, you don't want the real NIKE to be unable to then come in and set things right.</em></p>

<p>The conditions for trademark infringement are more or less this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are the names/logos/sounds/colours/whatever the same?</li>
<li>Are the business trades likely to be confused?</li>
<li>Are they in the same place?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can say ""no"" to any of those, you'll probably be fine.</p>

<p>As you see, part of the concern with trademarks is the industry they work in. If I wanted to get a trademark for ""Sony lawn-chair repair,"" I probably could. So if you're being hindered by another company with your name doing something similar to you, there's a good chance that you <em>will</em> be causing confusion, and that's bad for your customers no matter what.</p>

<p>Assuming you do <em>something</em> better than your competition, be that better quality or pricing, you don't want people being confused and going to the other place, finding it worse there, and never bothering to talk to you again.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, and again this certainly is not always going to be the case, it's probably good to think twice before trying to find a way around someone else's trademark.</p>

<h1>Is this all such a bad thing?</h1>

<p>Speaking to your actual business problem rather than the trademark question you asked, I know the idea of being forced away from your own trademark is a frustrating one, but it might not be all bad. I would take the opportunity to set up a new company and website (you could use the same backend and just map some fields to different hosts if that's easiest) that caters to the North American demographic more than yours does. In some cases, that will mean ""Find and Replacing"" all the ""-ours"" with ""-ors,"" in other cases, it may mean more.</p>

<p>It's annoying to have to dilute your brand by having two names to it, but it's not unheard-of. Most of your American networking will happen internally, and I suspect the same is true of the EU, so it's probably not a huge issue if two more or less disjoint sets of your customer-base know you by two different names, particularly if you can then overcome the separation with more targeted marketing to each demographic.</p>

","<p>This is a really subjective question. The answer itself may varies a lot based on your long term funding plan. </p>

<p>I'll try to address this in a generic way, but I would advice you to start thinking how this will reflect in a long term plan, also considering possible alternatives and pivoting half way through. </p>

<p>The wealthfront graph is accurate, but they are just percentages (calculated on existing data), and percentages in your case doesn't mean much.</p>

<p>The way you should see equities at this stage are:</p>

<p>1) equity are not a way to compensate but a way to retain and motivate.</p>

<p>Equities turns into money in two cases, dividend to redistribute or someone willing to trade cash for that equities. In a startup enviroment this means that equities worth nothing, until the company is either profitable or has a valuation and interest that leads to equity trading. This triggers a commitment in everyone being payed in equities. Either we succeed or those are worth nothing.
So is intrinsic that there is a goal. No need to set a specific time to distribute them.
An additional method to have an even more appealing retention is to distribute the issue of equities on a deadline/semester basis (ala stock vesting). This is more fluid that having to wait for a promotion cycle for rising the equities. 
You want to reward you team for being there, not metter if someone turn into a lv 5 from a lv 4, right?</p>

<p>2) is a strategic way to manage new funds.</p>

<p>Every time you are going through a round of funding, from seed to final, a dilution of equity will happen. Is either you decide to give away part of yours, or you decide to refactor everyone royalties in a proportioned way.
This is pretty important.Communicating this in the right way with your team (especially founders or early stage employees) is pretty important.</p>

<p>Back to your specific case, you product is different from the average IT startup. You have a continuous loss until the release date. Then you will have incomes, and hopefully profitability with a specific margin of growth, and an inevitable decay. 
Studying success (and failures) of similar software house / startups will help you find out more about how to manage compensations and equities.
Investing in Blizzard is different then investing in Uber. The former is a cycle based investment (similar to hardware releases) the latter is constant revenue stream (no metter if no profitable or not).</p>

<p>Hope this casted some lights and didn't add any confusion. </p>

<p>My personal suggestion is to motivate people to joining you with strong vision, a solid strategy and potentially an already existing good execution.
Show what is your goal, share with them the plans on how you want to get there, and prove you believe in it by showing all the work you have done so far.</p>

"Finding and researching a small problem to solve (singlehandedly)?","97","","<p>Now, I know the question sounds too abstract, so I'll try to explain. I work in IT industry and have a good amount of understanding of the modern 'technology', meaning I have the means to develop almost anything (software) on major platforms but unfortunately having the means doesn't mean that you can create the best product with your market and customers figured out, one needs to be able to understand the 'problem' in depth. And the best products come from people who solve problems they face themselves. Since I work with startups, most problems I come across are business related, meaning they would solve a problem for a business (B2B). Now if I leave my job and start building a product for a business, I would face one critical problem: I can't focus on sales and marketing while am trying to create the best quality product for businesses, and businesses are in general much more demanding than your average customers. The tool itself needs to be of the highest quality possible, and then there has to be a great support. So basically I don't have the means to provide everything and will have to stick to a small problem that I can solve for regular customers and by myself, I have the capability to handle a smaller problem, for example a chat, or note application. Now the issue here is, well I am very 'do it myself' kind of guy. I very rarely rely on apps to do stuff, for example I only ever use emails,note, calculator, browser on my phone. And there are already very well executed apps for these. So coming to the question.</p>

<p>Where do I begin to research a ""problem"" regular users face, that I may or may not understand, once I pick up the problem, I know how to research further into it. Its just that first ray of light that am looking for. How would 'you' start your research. </p>

<p>What I've already done:
* looked at other startups on angel and tried to find one that I could solve for other market. While this does provide insight into what others are doing, I crave for novelty and even if I ditch novelty, I really didn't find anything that excites me. </p>

<ul>
<li>researched ideas that I find interesting and look for its potential in a new market. I really like the idea of a great unserialised TV app (the universal Windows 10, excites me beyond anything, you can create so much in so little and apple tv/chromecast aren't far behind either), so I researched into it but it seems this won't have a good market for atleast a good 3-5 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>So well, this question came to my mind, how someone with entrepreneurial spirit goes about finding a problem? </p>
","<p>I advise you to take Steve Blank's course:<br>
<a href=""https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245</a></p>

"How valuable is a LinkedIn page for a web development business?","97","","<p>Obviously this is quite subjective and variable. So to limit it slightly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business type: Web development (primarily anyways)</li>
<li>Business size: 1-5 employees</li>
<li>Region: British Columbia Canada/Who cares it's web development, it can be anywhere (well I've only done stuff in North America but that's beside the point)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are very many tricks and methods to enhance pages to best drive customers, but I'm not interested in them right now - that'd be scope creep on this question. So the question is, assuming a relatively well made LinkedIn site, will it actually drive customers?</p>
","<p>Yes, it will drive customers for web development if utilized correctly.</p>

<p>They can be a very powerful thing if you learn all of those tricks of how to leverage them.</p>

<p>My first thought when reading your title ""How valuable is a LinkedIn page for a business"" was, well that depends on the type of business.  For most web development companies, their target demographic (or at least part of it) can be found on LinkedIn which is full of professionals in whatever industry you can think of which also provides access to the companies they're associated with.</p>

<p>I've known a couple of web development companies to leverage it as their main source of customer acquisition and do well with it. It provides a good platform for showing your expertise through your interactions with different people, companies, and groups on the network.</p>

<p>One side benefit, though your service isn't restricted to one location, you have the option of connecting specifically with people, groups, and companies in your area if you wanted to do more work locally. I don't know specifically about your region, I'm guessing this holds true.</p>

<p>That said, there are people that will recommend a LinkedIn profile for EVERYONE. I don't know that LinkedIn is a great customer acquisition source for all businesses. I used to work for a company that built and sold flatbed trailers. LinkedIn isn't where people go to look for flatbed trailers so their time was likely better spent elsewhere. They never had much desire to get into social media anyway, but if they had, LinkedIn would not have been high on the list... maybe slightly higher than Pinterest or Instagram :)</p>

<p>It's all about finding the places where your target market gather and then learning ways to connect with them and provide them with value right where they already are (that's so much easier than trying to convince them they need the value you're providing somewhere else). </p>

<p><strong>EDIT TO ADD:</strong>
I re-read your question and I want to be sure to clarify that I doubt the page itself will drive a ton of traffic, but it can be used as a tool to get traffic by being actively involved in the communities that exist on the LinkedIn network.</p>

"Outsource or Inhouse as Developer","97","","<p>Our StartUp has two advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are web developers and are able to develop our product by our own</li>
<li>We have some connections and we know we could outsource our project</li>
</ul>

<p>But we have one big problem: We lack of time and still are bound to other projects.</p>

<p>Now, we are from Germany and we would have to pay high wages to get someone with the potential to do our tasks. But this guy will sit next to us and we would have full control over him. Problem is, we only need him for the time of development, after that, we would have no task for him.</p>

<p>We also build up some contacts to partners outside of Germany, which are able to develop way cheaper, then we could do. (Think of it as: If I develop one hour on this project, i will loose one hour on an other, paid project. Which is about twice the amount, i would pay to our partner)</p>

<p>What would you suggest in such a situation? We have the capabilities, but also have way cheaper alternatives. We also only have few experience with outsourcing, but still are into the topic of web development, so we can distinguish between good and bad quality.</p>

<p>We thought about some kind of mixture, but we are really stuck on this topic.</p>
","<p>I think outsourcing works, if you know what to outsource. Let me explain --</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are product co. and you have non essential tasks like building automated UI tests, since you dont want to recruit test engineers right away. It makes sense even to outsource your legacy product maintenance, since you want to go full speed with new version.</li>
<li>If you are into services and you want to scale then outsourcing works. But threading there would need some extra work initially till you have good understanding with outsourced individual/team/co.
Most troubles come when things are put blindly without deep monitoring(code reviews, status updates, demos etc...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/03/why-when-what-how-outsource.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> which talks similar concept of what to outsource etc..

"Registering A Business For A Minor (Under 16)","97","","<p>I have recently started making a business to earn some money and was looking through the legal implications before I launch the business , however , I was looking at the HMRC website for registering as a sole trader and it says I need a National Insurance Number (<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/register-your-business-in-the-uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Found Here</a>):</p>

I have looked through the HMRC website and can't see anything about it.
Is this legal?
And if it is; What do I do about taxes?</p>
","<p>A few thoughts, prefixed with ... I am not a solicitor, or accountant, but have experience of starting and running small companies ... please get some legal advice to confirm or deny this.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.companylawclub.co.uk/who-can-be-a-director"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HMRC excludes minors</a> from being company directors (though the nearest I can find on hmrc.gov.uk is <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/directors-responsibilities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, but not quite as specific as the previous website list)</li>
<li>There seems to some disagreement if children can own shares in UK companies. <a href=""http://www.informdirect.co.uk/shares/can-a-child-own-shares/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> says they can, <a href=""http://www.accountingweb.co.uk/any-answers/child-buying-shares-in-parents-company"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> has an argument suggesting maybe they cant be. My personal experience says they can, as I did from the age of about 12 years of age, but maybe my dad held them in trust for me, but I don't believe so.</li>
<li>There seem to be some consideration that you should make with regard to the <a href=""http://www.contractoruk.com/s660/what_is_s660_section_660.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">S660 rules</a>, which attempt to stop individuals spreading their tax by passing income to other family individuals. <strong>But</strong> this really isnt your case, so they may not apply.</li>
<li>I would look seriously at <a href=""https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/setting-up-a-trust"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trusts</a>, as a tax and legal vehicle that your Dad can 'own' the business in trust for you. Clearly you would want some sunset clause on it, so that when you reached 18, that the trust would have a tax efficient way to wind up and convert (perhaps) into a Limited company with yourself as director. There are many many types of trusts within HRMC rules and their rules keep changing, so get some advice on this!</li>

"Vendors ask me about my budget to buy their data. How to negotiate with them?","97","","<p>I need to buy data for my program (to be more specific, the data is the definition from a good dictionary, not the ones that's available online). I do make money from my program. All of the vendors both ask me what is my budget to buy it, and the estimation of the number of users will use my program. I feel that they are trying to know how they should price their data. In return, I want to minimize the money I have to spend. How should I negotiate with them?</p>
","<p>Your assumption is only partially correct. Before initiating a sales one thing you do is to assess whether there's a fit or not. As a sales, that includes identifying whether a prospect is worth your time or not. You do so chiefly in terms of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whether the need is genuine vs one that's merely nice to have.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether you're taking to the right people, i.e. the ones whose opinions count and those who wield a checkbook vs an information gatherer.</p></li>
<li><p>How far away closing the deal is, i.e. ""I need it <em>right now!</em>"" vs ""<em>Maybe</em> I'll need it some day but please give me samples and a few hours of your time to help me make up my mind"".</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the budget is a) sensible for the task and b) worth your time as a sales.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't tick all four boxes a good sales will put you in one of two piles: ""Nurture"" (if you tick 2-3 boxes) or ""Abandon"".</p>

<p>The worst service you can do to yourself is to work against the sales by resisting answers - you'd end up in the ""Abandon"" box of any sensibly run sales team. Minimizing your costs may come at your own expense in the end.</p>

<p>The most common gotcha I see as a sales manager, as an aside, is when a prospect doesn't come prepared to pay a sensible price under any circumstance. You can try to articulate the actual costs involved in producing this or that piece of data (I'm in that business too), and some prospects see the light when you do. But in the end, if someone can't offset your costs then it's a bad fit and it gets filed under ""Abandon"" - the faster the better.</p>

<p>With this primer on how sales think out of the way, <strong>you want a BATNA</strong> (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) before going into any negotiation. As in, what is your credible alternative to NOT signing this deal.</p>

<p>In your case that likely means identifying what the actual costs involved are. Is it manual data entry? Data scraping? API integration? What's a sensible effort involved to get the final data in each case. Don't forget all of the potential complications, e.g. error/quality control, bot counter-measures, network failures, and what have you.</p>

<p>It also means identifying what your potential upside is. Not made up wishful thinking figures, but an actual, properly sketched upside. An excellent sales will refrain from selling you anything if they can't clearly picture the upside on your end. They do this because they like happy clients: happy clients sign new deals later on and, even more interestingly, send great referrals.</p>

<p>With these two cards in hand, you'll be in a much more comfortable position to negotiate: you'll know how low you can make it, at the cost of an alternative with whatever downsides, and you'll know what your maximum budget can be before it no longer makes any financial sense for you.</p>

<p>Again, do NOT try to be cheap at all costs: the deliverable needs to be worth your money, but producing it also needs to be worth someone else's time. If you broadcast that you're too cheap, the only thing you'll achieve is to make your sales conclude you're a bad fit or too hard to work with to be worth their org's time.</p>

<p>Last note: be aware that it's usually better to negotiate a deal as a whole than it is to negotiate it point by point... unless you're very seasoned in negotiations. If you're not, by all means avoid that kind of point by point chatter: put everything problematic forward at once when negotiations start, and work out as many concessions as you can from there. (You probably won't get them all, so do the most important ones first.)</p>

You can create a partnership agreement with the help of a good business lawyer, get it notarized for good measure and send your Indian partner a copy. Then you can you create the company, include the Indian partner as a shareholder and allocate him shares.

<p>This is because the investor needs to know that you and your team can actual accomplish and execute. Pictures, diagrams and idea presentation do not give the slightest clue to an investor if you can really bring your idea to life. (The best way to get an answer for such a question is always put yourself in the investor shoes for example, and ask your self the same question, in this case: ""Would I give money to someone only based on an idea and drawings without actually knowing what they can do?)</p>

<p>There's always the FFF (friend, family &amp; fools) category for early seed money which could easily be scored by being an amazing person, having an amazing idea, or by confusing someone with a lot of excess money, and doesn't really require proof just yet.</p>

<p>Like to everything there's also a rule to this. Investors may give you money, requiring less proof, when you have a successful exit in your past.</p>

<p>Taking all of this into consideration I recommend you to find a co-founder, set up an equity scheme to avoid future conflicts and build a prototype (even over weekends if it doesn't work out any other way) Then based on a working prototype you can already create a company and start pitching to investors.</p>

<li>Should I try to get a job in Silicon Valley?  I'm in the Midwest, at the moment.  Maybe if I move closer to where the action is, I'll meet more people.  Then again, it's expensive to live there...</li>
<li>Or, should I try to expand my side business into a full-time thing?  It's working well so far, but I'm not confident that it's scalable.</li>
<li>Freelance/consult?  Between that and my business, I might be able to scrape by.  But it probably won't leave me a whole lot of time to work on my own projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dang.  First world problems, right?</p>
","<p>To me the answer seems simple. <strong>Don't</strong> quit your Ph.d. Finish it even if it seems dull at the moment. Here are the reasons for my answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>From what you write, you don't have the idea for a startup at the moment, but you wish to, some day, to start your own business. If you still don't have a clear idea of what that should be, then wait.</li>
<li>If I understand your situation the right way, then you are not finished with your Ph.d. program. I guess the maximum time you have left would be something like three years? If you can't stand that through, you will probably not walk the long mile with a business anyway. Even though it is exciting starting a business, it's also hard and devastating at times. There will often be thousands of reasons to quit, not enough funds, competing business copying your ideas, difficulties finding the right employees etc.. From personal experience, one of the most valuable lessons I've learned, is doing one thing at the time and following through.</li>
<li>Being at a university is a huge resource of network and brainpower. You got acces to all the newest research within any area, most of which you can access from being in a ph.d. program. You are closely linked to probably thousands of students that finish their studies and will be looking for jobs. Finding talent is one of the hardest things and you are surrounded by it, why would you look for it somewhere else? If you do a little work, you can probably get some bachelor or candidate students to try out some of your ideas. </li>
<li>If you think your side-business isn't scalable, then it probably isn't! If you want to find out, then describe it and post it here and see what people think. </li>
</ol>

<p>To start your own startup is hard and dedicated work. You need to be able to turn things in to your advantage, to me, being in a Ph.d. program is a lot of advantage.</p>

<p>This is my personal opinion. It's not the only answer to your question, there are many answers. Finish what you started, unless you got something so compelling, that nothing else matters.  </p>

","<p>This is a subjective question but,</p>

<p>As a lean startup supporter, I should you should just <strong>launch the app already</strong> without the tutorial. Preferably your app design should come <strong>natural</strong> to the end user and they shouldn't need tutorials/documentations. </p>

<p>You should <strong>learn</strong> the <strong>user behavior</strong> especially because you have an <strong>innovative concept</strong>.

"Is including a work-for-hire clause in my contracts sufficient to ensure that I own the resulting work?","95","","<p>I run a small business that focuses on software development, and I occasionally hire outside graphic designers to do contract work for me. When I do that, I'm sure to include a work-for-hire clause so that I own the work and they can't use it for other purposes or contracts for other people (in essence, I want to retain the copyright).</p>

<p>Is that a sufficient form of legal protection to make sure that the work they do for me remains solely mine and they can't use it elsewhere?</p>

<p><em>I'm actually pulling the ""share your knowledge, Q&amp;A-style"" card here.</em></p>
","<p>No, as it turns out, the copyright law in the United States calls on only a specific set of situations that actually allow work-for-hire copyright claims.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Many freelance workers, and more relevantly here, people who hire freelance workers think--as I did, until relatively recently--that work-for-hire clauses covered most materials produced. For instance, as a company that frequently works for contracts, I was under the impression that the <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/826/59"">copyright on any code I wrote</a> was transferred over to the hiring party, because I specified that I was doing the work for them.</p>

<p>Just to be complete, this is what a pretty typical work-for-hire clause might look like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FREELANCER and HIRING COMPANY intend for this to be a contract for services and each considers the products and results of the services to be rendered by the FREELANCER to be a work made for hire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The issue</h1>

<p>As it turns out, calling something a ""work for hire"" only helps in <em>certain cases</em>. It does apply to employer/employee relationships, so that isn't affected by anything I'm saying here, but contract work is.</p>

<p>In general--and I've included the full quote below for specifics--it seems that most if not all work that I would ever have contracted out is <em>not</em> covered by this wording. The copyright ownership is only transferred in a select few cases, which focus mostly on when a contract worker does something that is a part of something bigger. For example, and again this is detailed nicely in what I've quoted below, it applies to freelancers who help with <em>part</em> of a motion picture. There are some fairly obscure and specific cases that it actually works for, but it wouldn't work, say, if someone designed a logo for you, or did software development.</p>

<p>This is taken directly from the <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relevant law.</a> As you'll see, there are definitely cases where work-for-hire clauses are quite effective, but they are but a small subset of all cases people use them in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A “work made for hire” is—</p>
  
  <p>(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or</p>
  
  <p>(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a “supplementary work” is a work prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting in the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an “instructional text” is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Potential Reprocussions</h1>

<p>Because the copyright stays with the creator in these cases, you could find a competitor (or even an unrelated business) who uses the same designer and ends up with the same logo. It's unlikely, but it's a risk.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, if I contracted a developer to build a library to parse PDF files for me, and print the contents to plain-text files. I might expect, after paying <em>$x</em> per hour for that work to be done, that the developer would give me the source code and complete control over the work done, and that would be that. But in reality, it turns out that the same developer could actually then go and sell the very same source code for the very same library to another company without even informing me, effectively making me pay for someone else's work.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>Fortunately, the biggest issue here is simply in awareness. It's easy enough to add on a clause that specifies that the ownership of the copyright is to be transferred to me, the hiring party.</p>

<p>I've taken this example from <a href=""http://web.law.columbia.edu/keep-your-copyrights/contracts/clauses/by-type/15/overreaching"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Columbia University's ""Keep Your Copyrights/Columbia Law School""</a>, but this is a good example of a clause that would cover other cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If for any reason the Work would not be considered a work made for hire under applicable law, the AUTHOR does hereby sell, assign, and transfer to [distributor] its successors and assigns, the entire right, title and interest in and to the copyright in the Work and any registrations and copyright applications relating thereto and any renewals and extensions thereof, and in and to all works based upon, derived from, or incorporating the Work, . . . throughout the world.</p>

","<p>Tough situation you have in hands but if you really want to keep your dream (startup) alive, you have some options.</p>

<p>But no matter which option you choose, you need to use <strong>Assertiveness</strong>. </p>

<p>See, according to Wikipedia, assertiveness is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the quality of being self-assured and confident without being
  aggressive. In the field of psychology and psychotherapy, it is a
  learnable skill and mode of communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel you, you are pissed and even a little bit angry with those fake partners, but talking in an intelligent way is your best shot. </p>

<p>Being assertive means you won't ""lose your shit"" in front of them but also you won't talk too soft. You will communicate what you really mean, in a confident way, without starting a fight. </p>

<p>Yes, it is not easy, but as already mentioned in the definition, is a skill that can be learned through some training and rehearse.</p>

<p><strong>IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM</strong></p>

<p>Probably you already know what you want to talk to them, but I'd like to emphasize that you need to <strong>get a commitment from them</strong>, here how I'd try to address this situation (of course, individually): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We're getting into a new phase for our company and we need everyone on
  board. It doesn't matter how much effort we have put already so far,
  we need and we're going to work harder from now on. Now let me ask you
  something: Are you really willing to commit to this project and do
  whatever is necessary to us to succeed or are you looking for new
  ventures? Because if you decide to stick with us, we need to agree on
  a job description and milestones for everyone, you included. We're
  going to review this bi-weekly because, as I said, we need everyone on
  board and those who do not aggregate, will have to leave giving space
  for new partners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THEM</strong></p>

<p>Another way is buying your shares back. Again you're going to need assertiveness. Say to them you're not happy with his/her performance and, when invited him/her to the project, was expecting much more effort and commitment. Ask him what happened.. let him/her talk. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now say that you really want to look for a new partner to do what
  him/her was supposed to do and ask what agreement it can be made.</p>

"Bitcoins and Litecoins in Startups","94","","<p>Is a good deal accept payments in Bitcoins and Litecoins for services in my Startup? I'm expecting here some aspects like availability and utility value.</p>

<p>Which companies are accepting these currencies?</p>
","<p>There are a number of factors that you should consider when deciding whether to accept payments in a currency like Bitcoin:</p>

<ol>
<li><h1>Currency risk</h1>

<p>If one receives income in one currency but disburses payments in another, then one is exposed to currency risk: that is, the value of the received currency may move before it is exchanged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  
  <p>Alice sells goods online and decides to start accepting Bitcoins.  She has a widget in inventory that was purchased on credit for $400.  Knowing that ฿1 is currently worth circa $480, she agrees to sell that widget to Bob for ฿1.  Before she is able to exchange the received Bitcoin, its value collapses to $300.  Her expected profit of $80 has suddenly become a $100 loss!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such risk <em>always</em> exists when dealing in multiple currencies.  However, compared with major currencies, Bitcoin has been (and likely will continue to be, owing to the by-design exponentially decaying rate at which new coins can be mined) <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=Linear&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1410390527818&amp;chddm=248580&amp;cmpto=CURRENCY:EURUSD&amp;cmptdms=0&amp;q=CURRENCY:BTCUSD&amp;ntsp=1&amp;ei=ytkQVKicDovGwAOA54Aw"">extremely volatile</a>: thus unless you are willing to gamble on its value, you may wish to consider whether you really want to hold it.</p>

<p>This is especially true when one considers that any position you hold from sales is almost certainly leveraged (only the profit element is pure equity&mdash;the remainder is working capital, which is usually financed by credit) and therefore, like Alice above, you may lose money that you don't have.  This puts your business at risk.</p></li>
<li><h1>Liquidity risk</h1>

<p>Liquidity is <em>related</em> to currency risk insofar as liquidity affects the currency's value&mdash;but they are not the same thing.  There may be widespread agreement on the value of a Bitcoin, but if you have difficulty finding a buyer then you may be left with your capital tied up in a currency with which you're unable to pay your bills.  Again, this puts your business at risk.</p>

<p>To some degree, this is becoming less of an issue as the means of exchanging Bitcoins for other currencies become more numerous, more reliable and more stable.  However, it's worth remembering that some of the biggest exchanges have at times failed or closed and that a changing regulatory landscape may further limit your exit options: more on that below.</p></li>
<li><h1>Regulatory risk</h1>

<p>There continues to be high-level discussion within governments over how to regulate Bitcoin: indeed the legality of its use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country"">differs around the world</a>.  Such action could affect not only the currency's value and its liquidity, but also your criminal liability for handling the currency.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you may find that your bankers will be concerned by your trade in Bitcoins and may withdraw their facilities from you (to avoid, for example, any suggestion of money laundering).</p></li>
<li><h1>Security risk</h1>

<p>There have been much-publicised thefts of Bitcoins from digital wallets, together with ongoing attacks on the protocol itself.  You may wish to evaluate the risk to your business of a successful attack and consider how those risks can be mitigated.</p></li>
<li><h1>Reputational risk</h1>

<p>This is a double-edged sword.  Within some market segments, there may be a positive reputational benefit from accepting Bitcoins; whereas in other market segments, your partners may be concerned by possible negative repuational implications.</p></li>

"Copyright implications of Start-up using unowned Youtube videos","94","","<p>I had an idea to create a start-up that is based around the idea of taking a particular genre of Youtube videos and putting them onto a centralized, web-based application, making it easier for the user to access the videos they want with minimal effort. I have additional ideas to add on top of this to make it more unique but stripping it down to its basics, that is what it will be.</p>

<p>My only concern is that the whole concept of this idea is that I will be displaying videos that I am not the original owner of and potentially making a profit from it e.g. through ad revenue.</p>

<p>Being that these Youtube videos have been posted on a site that everyone has access to, (obviously not EVERYONE) I would assume that as long as you're not claiming the video as your own, you would be able to allow users to watch the video from your site. </p>

<p>What I would like to know is if there is a possibility that this could leader to content owners filing a suit against me for making a profit from their videos.</p>

<p>I am aware of sites such as <a href=""https://www.stumbleupon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">StumbleUpon</a> that allow you to search through different types of videos depending on pre-selected preferences but am not sure if there are particular copyright rules that they need to follow or if they contact every single content owner for permission to be able to do this. I don't feel that the latter would be feasible.</p>

"How to Efficiently Identify Market Competition","94","","<p>I am working on a startup that is putting together a pitch deck for investors. A part of this is doing a market analysis--identifying competition in the market and analyzing the differences/similarities in our services. I have been using angel.co, crunchbase.com, and pwcmoneytree.com to get lists of companies to look into. However our startup offers services that target a very broad demographic (many different sectors). So I end up with massive lists of companies to research (10,000s). How would you approach this? What are some techniques for identifying companies/startups that offer similar or related services across many industries?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p>EDIT:
In response to JCA's comment, the markets that our products are targeting in particular are: educational productivity software (K-12 and Higher), medical organizational software, business management software.</p>
","<p>When we've done market studies we focus on those that we're in direct competition with currently or those players that we'll be competing with when we enter the market. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to conduct market research on all competitors. Our research usually involves the size of the market, the opportunity we see in the market (differentiation), the challenges of the market.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to complete a Competitive Analysis on those market players you'll be competing with directly and communicate your Competitive Advantage. An additional tool is to create a SWAT analysis, however, this may not be descriptive enough in your business plan.</p>

"Who to target 1st in employement website (egg or chicken)","94","","<p>I have created an employment website which is totally different than my competitors for both job seekers and for companies. Now I want to start marketing, just don't have a clear idea which one to target first. I mean Job seekers would be looking for posted jobs and companies would be looking for website traffic or registered users? </p>

<p>I'm thinking to target 80% job seekers and 20% companies? would it be a smart plan?</p>

<p>For more info I'm not charging companies to post a 5-10 jobs and its totally free for job-seekers.</p>
","<p>A website that connects supply and demand is a marketplace and marketplaces are almost always <strong>driven by demand</strong> - that is, whoever is paying money or giving more concrete value. Any application that has a lot of purchasing demand will attract supply. </p>

<p>For example, Uber is the fastest growing marketplace in history and has more buyers wanting rides than drivers to serve them. That's led to wage wars between Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, and other competitors aiming to secure the most and best supply.</p>

<p>In your case, most job sites charge companies since they have more money. Thus, while this may sound counter-intuitive, I think <strong>companies are your demand (buyers) and job seekers are your supply</strong>. That especially makes sense in this job environment where many industries have more people seeking work (supply) than employers seeking to hire them (buyers).</p>

<p>A best practice in building marketplaces is to <strong>start by seeding the app with an initial high-quality supply</strong>, then bring buyers to purchase them. It's hard to get buyers excited about your app if there's no supply.</p>

<p>For example, when Josh Kopelman started Half.com, he worked for months to form partnerships with bookstores so that Half had a million books available at launch. Half was acquired within 18 months for $350 million.</p>

<p>Given that buyers drive marketplaces, if you haven't already, you should definitely <strong>talk with a lot of companies</strong> about what they want in job-seekers. ""Get outside the building"" to learn what your paying customer wants. That could save you a lot of time building the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Once that's clear, you could focus on recruiting relevant, high-quality job seekers (supply). That's trickier than a typical marketplace where businesses are the suppliers because in those cases, you can build supply through business directories. In your case, sources of job-seekers could include LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed, and other sites where people post their resumes. If you have a unique niche, you can certainly target job-seekers by that niche.</p>

<p>Determining the best marketing channels to acquire the right job-seekers will likely take time. Building two-sided marketplaces is extremely hard. Once at scale, they are extremely valuable. Expect to be in it for the long haul!</p>

<p><strong>Simon Rothman at Greylock</strong> is an expert in building marketplaces and leads Greylock's $100 million marketplace fund. I recommend reading some of his advice.</p>

Open a small office in Silicon Valley but keep most of the operations, development, etc.. and 1 cofounder in Europe. This way I believe we can get more stuff done with the funding we receive.</p>

<p>I know that they don't directly invest in companies that are not present in US. But what if we had linked companies in 2 countries?</p>
","<p>During a recent mission to the Silicon Valley, with an Angel Group, I had many meetings with SV angels, advisors, mentors, accelerators, lawyers and consultants.</p>

<p>One of the things that was highly mentioned by all of them is the lack of available talent in the Valley at this point. Economy is blooming and even a StartUp investment bubble is being considered. Finance-focused media has even written about that possible bubble recently.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons that seem to be well mentioned is precisely the difficulty in bringing in foreign talent to the US in general, and as a consequence, to SV. That is a collateral effect of the immigration policy adopted as a general rule in the US.</p>

<p>Being with a foreign mission, one of my main objectives was trying to understand how to get some of my invested StartUps in the US market, and in SV if possible. So that theme was pretty well addressed in my questions and remarks.</p>

<p>The general rule that was stated was: if you have a legally established US company and your Tech Founder and preferably the CEO (or some other high C-level team member) are located in the Silicon Valley and you have a huge market in the US for whatever  it is that you do, than your company will be treated as a US company by local investors. Having a foreign team seems to be the rule these days, and cost-economy and visa issues is making that even desirable for some companies.</p>

"How can I effectively convey a holiday theme in my restaurant in a secular way?","92","","<p>I own a small, been-in-the-family-for-years sort of restaurant business, and I'm looking to drum up some business, and appear fun and inviting to patrons. To that goal, I've thought about decorating my storefront and interior with some holiday themes for the month.</p>

<p>How can I accomplish that general feeling without appearing to favor any religion in particular? The obvious counter-example of what I'm looking for is if I had a Christmas tree in my window, since that would (I assume) favor Christmas over anything else.</p>

<p>My primary goal is simply not to offend anyone. I'd like not to associate with any particular holiday or religion if possible, but if something is on-the-bounds but generally accepted, I'd be okay with that too.</p>

<p>Would it be acceptable for me to put lights up? I've heard that white lights are okay, but other ones make it seem too Christmas-y. That seems pretty sad, since color is a lot more exciting, but I can live with that if need be. What other decorations are universally accepted?</p>

<p>I've also thought about printing up some new menus or inserts that have wreaths or other similar depictions on the borders, but I'm not sure whether that would be too Christmas-y or not.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking maybe fake snow is a nice and universal decoration? I'm just not sure how much I can do of that before it gets boring and less fun. It seems like a subtle accent, which is great, but I think I'm looking for something a little meatier.</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not looking for a shopping list. I'm just wondering what I can do big-picture.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just overthinking this all. That's quite possible, and I could accept that.</p>
","<p>Speaking as someone who doesn't celebrate Xmas, I don't think anyone would get offended at the usual ""Happy Holidays / Merry Christmas"" decorations with the colored lights, tree, Xmas paraphernalia, etc. Winter is fun for everyone and the decorations are part of it. The token Hanukkah menorah and a Kwanzaa mention tend to look a bit forced, though, and I guess that's what you're trying to avoid. So, my two cents:</p>

<p>Winter and New Year themes can be pretty secular. So skip the Santa hats, colored lights, fake wrapped gift boxes, reindeer, wreaths, and trees, etc.</p>

<p>Stick with New Year / Snow / Winter (snowmen, snowflakes, ""Happy New Year"" paraphenalia, maybe white lights) and I think you'll accomplish your goals of decorating with a winter holiday theme that doesn't invoke a specific holiday.</p>

<p>The phrase ""Happy Holidays"" still seems religious to me, even if it doesn't specify a specific holiday. I'd stick with ""Happy New Year"" if you really want to avoid any hint of religion but still have an upbeat message.</p>

<p>Of course, if your tool represents a substantial step forward with the language, you may also begin to drive development there.  Also, Ruby is still the most-popular MVC environment out there.  You can point to a large base of users who know the language, even if they are working elsewhere, and then talk about how your specialized tools will make things much better, making Ruby a great development platform for certain kinds of use cases.

"Is there any contract that my software company and my client/employer can sign so that I make sure he pays when the job is done?","92","","<p>I'm a software developer and director of a small software company, and I usually work by invoicing my clients which in a sense are my employers (corp to corp relationship).</p>

<p>Sometimes I get long term jobs, but up until now, I had no legal way of making sure I get payed.</p>

<p>As a result there were times at which the job was over and the client decided to not pay me (using many excuses such as <code>I'm broke</code> etc).</p>

<p>Is there any legal way I can make sure they will pay me after I complete the job for them?
I've heard of contracts but I'm not so sure they really work.</p>

<p>Note that I'm from Greece (European Union) and I usually work with companies found within the US.</p>

<p>What do you suggest? 
Thank you.</p>
","<p>There is no contract that will ensure you get paid. You can only do what you can to reduce the risks. At the end of the day, if the client does not want to pay, a piece of paper won't bring instant relief. You would legally have to chase and an arbitrator or judge would have to award in your favour.</p>

<p>It is important that you realise this - it implies that just because you have a contract, it does not mean that within 30days of delivery you can hand on heart confirm you'll get paid.</p>

<p>One of the issues that come with your sort of service is your definition of ""job done"" and the clients definition often differ greatly. I've been contracting since 1994 and have seen a few contracts and been part of a few misunderstandings to have a fair idea on what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Oh! Don't consider your client as an employer. They are not. Legally, huge difference. You are a service provider. They are your customer, or your client. One business working for another business is NOT the same as an employee/employer relationship. When you pay your electricity company, they are not your employee, you are not their employer. Your electricity company is a service provider. You are the client/customer. Employees get sick/holiday/pension and other benefits. When you are a service provider, you do not get these benefits.</p>

<p>So... </p>

<p>You need a contract, and a project plan. The project plan needs to have stage gates - nothing worse than you doing your thing for several months, then produce the goods and for the client to say they wanted red apples, not green apples. If you have stage gates, showing clearly agreed milestones, it weakens their potential arguements at a later stage.</p>

<p>Saying that - I just won't work with a client if I felt there was any doubt about getting paid.</p>

<p>Long story cut short I had friends who had a web design company. A well known local business man asked them to do a football club fan site. Basic detail and design was agreed. Three or four months later, it was delivered. Client then spent the next six months pushing for extra changes. He kept delaying payment until the web design company almost went bust. He then threatened if they did not do as he asked he would tell all his business contacts not to do business with my web design friends.</p>

<p>Clients like this are rare, thankfully, but they do exist.</p>

<p>My friends eventually just gave up - stopped all further changes until they could get a base line. Pay for the work done, and agree more clearly on what future changes would be done, and agree a price for those changes.</p>

<p>Simarly make sure your contract includes a project plan. Agree when certain stages will be done, agree certain tests that will confirm the task is delivered. Ensure customer has a maximum of five or seven days to reply to any of your questions. At every ""stage gate"" you reach, they have x number of days to accept/decline that level of progress.</p>

<p>Its painful making such plans, but it reduces head aches later.</p>

<p>Also agree on an arbitrator. Many contracts have them. Almost all of mine say that English courts and English law applies - one had me agree to US arbitration law in a specific state and town - I had a good relationship with the customer and accepted it, though I would never have afforded to chase for unpaid bills.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you do have a disagreement with the client, pause, stay calm. Ask yourself if they are being an idiot, or if there is potential of genuine misunderstanding. Did they wake up one day to make your day hell, or did you both start two different journeys? If the latter occured, find compromise. Getting most of your money sooner is better than the risk of more, or less money after you have exhausted legal avenues.</p>

<p>Oh... and there are companies who will buy your invoice - speak with your bank or an accountant for recommendations. Basically, they will pay you 90% of your invoice for example, and then go chase the 100%. When they get paid, they make a tidy profit.</p>

The legal environment is very dynamic and the limits of fair use itself are constantly being <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-media-germany-idUSKCN0SL2TI20151027"" rel=""nofollow"">battled in court</a>.</p>

<p>Using scraped data is legit and useful for a wide range of activities. Google, for one, would not be able to let you search the internet without scraping it. But that's only the surface. Among the plethora of other use cases we encounter, there are price comparison apps of course, but also competitor or reseller monitoring apps, marketing or consumer analytics apps, data augmentation apps, businesses scraping small amounts of data behind a login on a daily basis to automate a data entry assistant's job (e.g. new court rulings), <a href=""https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2016/07/13/improving-access-to-peruvian-congress-bills-with-scrapy/"" rel=""nofollow"">watchdog groups that scrape government data</a> to surface corruption, national statistics agencies scraping prices on e-commerce sites to automate calculating consumer price indexes, and even law enforcement agencies <a href=""http://www.darpa.mil/program/memex"" rel=""nofollow"">monitoring the dark web</a> for criminal activities. Pretty much everyone is doing it.</p>

<p>Legit scraping use cases tend to have this much in common though: they slice and dice, augment, filter, and otherwise process the data, rather than serve it raw, as is. In this sense app authors can all put forward that they're providing a service, which is collecting the data, and then providing some analysis and conclusions based on it or otherwise adding value by augmenting it. (In some sense you can think of it as an attorney giving you legal advice. The attorney doesn't technically own the factual advice and it doesn't matter that they don't. What they do is package it up, provide you access to it, and add value by helping you make decisions.)</p>

<p>In your case, I'd gather your data source will have a thing or two to say in court - to put it mildly - if you're competing against them using data that is a) collected from their own site and b) served essentially as is on yours. If that doesn't more or less describe what you're up to, then the right thing to do is to double-check with a lawyer for proper legal advice. And <em>then</em> reach out to your data source if appropriate and applicable.</p>

"how do you ensure a sustainable competitive advantage long enough to get a headstart?","91","","<p>I know that answers to this question will be too broad, so I'll try to limit the scope a bit. I am specifically interested in web based applications/services startups. whereas the value or the product is a digital service that can be replicated by competitors, is there a special type of IPs or copyrights to maintain a competitive advantage or is there another way of doing this ?particularly in the initial stages while gaining users ?</p>
","<p>If what you are doing is unique enough you may be able to patent the business method. You can also patent the unique designs on the site. If there is a unique process in the code behind the site, that maybe patentable as well. </p>

<p>Patent enforcement is a difficult problem for a startup because</p>

<ol>
<li>Patenting in one country is not sufficient because your site can be accessed from all over. You can get an international patent that covers the WTO countries but those are pricey. </li>
<li>Monitoring patents, advising on infringement and deciding to sue is an expensive process</li>
<li>Suing is a time consuming and expensive process</li>
<li>Patenting involves doing a thorough search for existing patents, creating good claims and even with a lawyer it is time consuming</li>
</ol>

<p>It maybe an idea to just pursue with development and launch the product. You can use a non disclosure agreement during the test phases when you have to show your product to outsiders. After launch, a good tactic would be to do constant development so you have constant innovation. That way, your site would  always be on the cutting edge and by the time somebody develops a copy of it, you would have evolved with new features or looks. You can keep this up until the product gains maturity and market recognition. </p>

<p>In sales businesses such as ""here is our product it costs this much"" the metrics are similar if there is 10 users, and if there is 10 million users. 
But in network effect businesses the metrics change as more users start using it. The metrics change a lot if FB is used by 1 billion people instead of 1000 people. </p>

<p>How to use it efficiently in a network effect business.</p>
","<p>After some more reading Eric Reis mentions this in pg. 118 of the book ""The Lean Startup""</p>

<p>Summary of it is to focus on Retention as much as you can, that is the key metric network effect businesses should consider. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By contrast, a marketplace company that matches buyers and
  sellers such as eBay will have a different growth model. Its success
  depends primarily on the network effects that make it the premier
  destination for both buyers and sellers to transact business. Sellers
  want the marketplace with the highest number of potential
  customers. Buyers want the marketplace with the most competition
  among sellers, which leads to the greatest availability of products
  and the lowest prices. (In economics, this sometimes is called
  supply-side increasing returns and demand-side increasing returns.)
  For this kind of startup, the important thing to measure is that the
  network effects are working, as evidenced by the high retention rate
  network effects are working, as evidenced by the high retention rate
  of new buyers and sellers. If people stick with the product with
  very little attrition, the marketplace will grow no matter how the
  company acquires new customers. The growth curve will look like
  a compounding interest table, with the rate of growth depending on
  the “interest rate” of new customers coming to the product.
  Though these two businesses have very different drivers of
  growth, we can still use a common framework to hold their leaders
  accountable. This framework supports accountability even when the
  model changes.</p>

"Toll free number?","91","","<p>How do you get international customers and prospects to call you and talk with you? Do you need a toll free number like evoice or grasshopper? </p>

<p>Or does a skype number more suitable?</p>

<p>I am currently using skype to go number to dial skype, and then dial the international number.</p>

<p>For incoming, I'm giving customers my mobile number but not sure if wind mobile charges for international incoming calls.</p>
","<p>I imagine this is to deliver support and the occasional sales questions, so answering the question from that angle.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself from back when I was running a product-oriented business, combining good usability, on-screen docs, a forum, Skype chat + calls, and Skype-in/Skype-out worked pretty well.</p>

<p>The clients helped each other out when the on-screen docs weren't enough. Don't discount UI, readily available docs and a forum, as this combination really helps you scale -- in my case from zero to 2k clients single-handedly in spite of a support intensive application.</p>

<p>I'd chime in when needed in the forum, of course. And later, I recruited active forum members to help out more actively than I could reasonably expect them to for free.</p>

<p>In pathological cases, we'd escalate to Skype chat or Skype calls, and Skype-in/Skype-out was a good fallback when neither worked for them.</p>

<p>My main gripe with doing everything on Skype was that it wasn't group-oriented (there might be options now.) This is fine as long as you're alone answering the calls or when you want to keep in touch with a few key clients. It kind of fell apart when I wanted staff to handle this for me, since old time users would already be in my contacts and not bother with the forum if I was around. As such, tip: be wary of that and be forward looking in this sense.</p>

<p>My mobile phone was on my site all along. Here's another tip if you go that route: be <em>very</em> wary and make your time zone <em>very</em> explicit. Not doing so essentially guarantees that you'll get 3am phone calls with some level of regularity. Because, well, some colorful and deliciously friendly US citizens cannot imagine that it might be the middle of the night on the other side of the pond.</p>

<p>Prior to Skype-in/Skype-out, I had briefly looked into getting a carrier to set up an actual phone number. It's not on your radar, but I'll mention it nonetheless as bad (it's expensive) for reference.</p>

<p>With all that said, this was a half dozen years ago.</p>

<p>New VoIP services (such as Grasshopper) have appeared since and, quite frankly, look rather fantastic. Were I to do the above all over, I'd probably go with that -- alongside a forum or some kind of social support software (e.g. GetSatisfaction), Skype, and possibly some live chat software that can fit on the website (e.g. Olark or Slack or both) for the occasional user who doesn't use chat apps.</p>

"What should I do with my concept?","91","","<p>Some time ago I finished a concept of human-computer interaction based on 10/gui from 2009. When I saw it in 2010, I couldn’t get it out of my head and started working on my own concept, taking into account imperfections that 10/gui definitely had.</p>

<p>My concept takes imperfections arising from using mouse, touch screen and 10/gui into account, lets user free of any wearables, rapid changes in habits and information overload. At this point, I won’t unveil much information, though anybody could say “I’ve seen something like that somewhere”, but the strength of my concept lies in many details and the whole thing seems quite finished on essential basis. I mean, there is always something to add or describe in more detail, but there is no point to do it at this stage.</p>

<p>Right now, I have 40-slide “short” presentation and 150-slide earlier presentation. I had to remade whole presentation from scratch to be able to show it to someone who doesn’t have enough enthusiasm to study something like this for hours. It took a year extra. </p>

<p>During the making of these materials, some prototypes of similar kind appeared in media, such as Leap Motion, Ractiv Touch+, Apple Force Touch, Sensel Morph, and some others. They all have one thing in common: incompleteness. Solving one thing while adding others, improving A while overlooking B. But the message is clear: there is a certain need for advanced human-computer interaction concept (among those outlined in 10/gui) therefore there is a gap on the market.
My problem? Not sure what should I do with that. I tried to consult it with people in business incubators, but the concept, even it’s described quite well, is still just weightless idea. I've literally run away from contest for business ideas. It just didn't fit between other ideas (like 'We are developing an app called Fnargelblarg developed in Knurkelplurg++ and we need $$$'), moreover mine was too technical for those businessmen and it just couldn't be described in 5 minute limit. Plus I can’t build it from scratch as I have no skills and don't know bunch of geek enthusiast to do so. All the people I've shown the concept gave me positive feedback, but I don't know anybody who would say something like 'I get it, it has great potential and I want to do it"".</p>

<p>I tried to contact one startup and university, but without an answer. I would try more, but I’d rather ask you what would you do in my position. I just want to make this happen and to have some control when implementing the idea. I know what should it be, what the target market should be, which features to add in future and how the end-user devices and advertisement should look like.</p>

<p>Is patenting a good idea? The concept would be protected and accessible to public on database, so it might interest some relevant people. What do you think?</p>

","<p>Startups are terribly hard. I would encourage you to find someone else who is as passionate about your idea as you are. A cofounding team helps each other all throughout the existence of the company, and is vital to its success.

"Why doesn't my partner want to split 10k equally ($3333 between 3), but would rather put aside an extra $2500?","91","","<p>So, three people did a web application together for a client, each as an individual contractor. We are not in an LLC together, nor did we interact at any point with this client as an LLC - always as contractors. Total payment for the project was 10k. We agree before the project to split the profits equally (each getting a third of the profits).</p>

<p>My thought was to have our client write 3 separate checks for $3333, giving each of us our cut. That seemed the easiest and most straight-forward.</p>

<p>But, one partner doesn't want that. He had the client write a check to him directly for the complete $10,000. He wants to give me $2500, another guy $2500, and but keep $5000 in his account; out of the $5000, he will pay himself $2500, but keep the rest in there to help pay for taxes (so $2500 for him, $2500 for taxes). Specially, he is worried that he will be taxed more than us because he was paid 10K, instead of $3333. He also said he had the client cut him 1 check for 10k instead of 3 checks for $3333 because it was easier for their accountant. </p>

<p>He says that once he pays himself $2500, and pays any extra taxes due to the fact he was paid 10k vs our $3333, he will take whatever is left and split that with us come April. </p>

<p>We still have to pay taxes on our $2500 and any money ""left over"" from the $2500 he put aside that might come in April. </p>

<p>This seemed really confusing to me. I said to him the best way is to just split the money $3333 each and we pay our own taxes. Plus we all get our money now and me and the other guy don't need to be taxed twice.</p>

<p>Am I missing something though? He is always saying how he is talking to his accountant about this. Is there any angle I'm missing? Can he save us more money his way or is a $3333 equal split just better?</p>
","<p>No idea where you live, and the information would be necessary to give a better answer, but FWIW where I currently live your partner wouldn't have withheld enough.</p>

<p>It seems you guys haven't incorporated a business. So you're technically correct in this particular case that you'd have been better off with three separate checks.</p>

<p>As things stand, he'll likely be on the hook for the initial $10k of income on his end, plus whatever taxes and social benefit-related contributions he needs to pay on what he paid you. Your sentiment is correct that the revenue he paid you could end up getting taxed twice.</p>

<p>By contrast, a corporation would have been taxed on the final profit instead, and you could have brought the latter to zero. (Or you could have paid the corporate tax on part or all of the initial income and distributed the balance as dividends, if that makes sense where you live.)</p>

<p>That being said, many countries have some kind of status whereby you're operating as a de facto (unlimited liability) business or something to that effect, so there might be hope to avoid the worst case scenario with the help of your accountant.</p>

<p>File this under lessons learned, and incorporate a business if you plan to work together again.</p>

"Can two similar but not identical TMs be registered in a single industry, if both contains generic words?","90","","<p>Can two similar but not identical Trademarks be registered in a single industry, if both contains generic words?</p>

<p>For example, could I register <code>bell burgers</code> if <code>bell place burgers</code> is already registered? If yes, could the competitor challenge the registration?</p>
","<p>It's always tough to say whether two trademarks would be found to be in conflict of each other. That's a human process performed by humans at the Patent and Trademark Office, so the conclusions they draw can be subjective.</p>

<p>But speaking from a purist perspective, I can tell you more or less what they're looking for.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not confusing</strong>: The point of trademarks is to avoid <em>consumer confusion</em>, which means if people look at Bell Burgers and associate it with Bell Place Burgers, that's a problem. By extension, if you opened up a salon, for random example, under the name ""Bell Salon,"" that probably wouldn't be confusing to anyone, and you'd be golden.</li>
<li><strong>Not descriptive</strong>: I mention this one because you brought up ""generic words."" I'm not sure it's directly relevant here, but a trademark isn't valid if it's descriptive of the service or product being offered. In other words, if you were referring to a burger joint called ""The Hamburger Place,"" that probably wouldn't make it through as a trademark, regardless of what other businesses were or were not in place with the name. If the word ""Bell"" was somehow descriptive or necessary to compete, it wouldn't be valid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, it's important to understand how trademark challenges work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-grant</strong>: When a trademark examiner looks at your mark, he or she does some searching to find whether it might be confusing with any other relevant marks.</li>
<li><strong>Post-grant</strong>: When a trademark holder comes up and says ""Hey, your mark is confusing to consumers, I'm going to sue you if you don't stop,"" they then have to <em>prove</em> that your mark did actually confuse people. It's no longer a subjective matter of whether people might be confused.</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, those are two very different questions that you asked. I wouldn't feel comfortable on a platform such as this jumping up and telling you that the examiner would feel one way or the other, nor that the public would. But hopefully this can lend a bit of insight to help you make a decision.</p>

<p>Of course, as usual, speaking with a trademark attorney might be of assistance.</p>

"How can I maintain expectations in my snow plowing business?","89","","<p>I run a small snow plowing business in a rural area. We're close on the threshold between not getting enough snow to warrant the business, and having enough snow that I'd need to expand. For the time being, I'm pretty comfortable with my albeit small fleet of two trucks.</p>

<p>But when it comes to particularly stormy years, or when snow is completely unexpected and comes anyway, how can I manage the expectations of eager customers? This is really just a side-business for me, so I'm not super keen on buying yet another truck to handle these rare occurrences. I don't generally have issues with them getting mad at me, but I always feel bad when they want to get driveways and parking lots clear and my trucks can only move so fast.</p>

<p>What options might I have to manage these expectations and help keep everyone on the same page? How can I convey to them the difficulty of my job and that not every lot can be my very top priority at any given time, while still maintaining a good level of satisfaction?</p>

<p>Again, this is really just an issue in extreme cases where more snow falls than I can handle. It's not a problem most of the time, but when it does happen, it can be frustrating for all involved.</p>
","<p>This could be a communications challenge, or it could be a business opportunity.</p>

<p>If it's a communications challenge, then your first job is to use the experience you have to describe plausible scenarios and their impact on customers. Perhaps there's one key variable such as inches of snowfall, or perhaps there are two or three. The thing customers experience is probably pretty simple - ""hours to fixed"" maybe. So if you have this mapped out, part of your service delivery is about setting customer expectations and managing the flow of communications. ""We've had 9 inches of snow, so we'll be getting everyone sorted in two days. On our plan, we'll be with you late tomorrow morning; we'll keep you updated.""</p>

<p>Yes, people will grumble and want to be at the head of a queue. But if you follow crisis management ideas, giving people confidence that you have a clear plan you're executing helps them understand that you may not be able to shift things for them without causing unseen complications. </p>

<p>But maybe it's a business opportunity. When you have a lot of snow, you <em>do</em> have real choices about priorities, that will play out very differently as you do your job. So maybe there's room for one or more ""priority"" levels. If you've done your basic mapping, and you know (say) that 8-12 inches of snow means two days to done, you could absolutely offer a priority service at a significant premium that goes with a one day service target in this context.</p>

<p>While you should always aim to price on value, you do need to price cognizant of costs. If this were a realistic scenario, you have some additional time owing to the inefficiency of dealing with two priority levels, so there is a real cost. And if everyone bought in to the priority service, you would need another plow, maybe two. Of course, if people are currently paying on demand, you have to cross another hurdle, to sign up for a service tier or to make some regular payment.</p>

<p>The great news is that it is going to cost you nothing to create viable service levels. In the worst case, where nobody goes for one of your premium tiers, you have strengthened your hand for the big snowfall day. ""That's right, Mr Donnington.

What if I take only the logo, without text, will it be considered my work of art? And say, what if I take this logo, and create a show called Star Way, is the show considered mine? Yes, it will be an obvious rip off, but will it be legally original?</p>

","<p>All of those would clearly be copyright infringement.  All the possibilities you mention would be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work"" rel=""nofollow"">derivative works</a> because you are modifying someone else's copyrighted work.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use"" rel=""nofollow"">Fair use</a> is a pretty big exception to copyright, but since it looks like you are primarily looking to profit from your derivative works, it is unlikely that it would be fair use.</p>

"Is it a good idea to launch an MVP to test an idea even if someone could steal the idea?","89","","<p>Ok, Im a software developer and am entertaining the idea of launching an MVP version of my app to research and see if people like the concept. From there I would build on the app and make it complete. </p>

<p>In the past I have ONLY shipped complete products, which can take a long time to do well - the downside to this is virtually no research, so if there is no reception I am left with nothing. </p>

<p>Trying this new approach, I am hesitant only because putting the MVP out there opens the door for another person with more resources to take the idea and make a fully executed version before I can. </p>

<p>Which approach is better for app development ? Should I worry more or less about competition when testing an MVP?</p>
","<p>Firstly, it is very rare for someone to steal your idea. At least until it has been proven to be successful.</p>

<p>If someone likes your idea and has more resources then it is more likely that they will let you test the idea, prove its success and then build it themselves. However the success of the business itself is not based solely on the idea but the execution and strategy around it.</p>

<p>Having said that MVPs are difficult to judge as they are not just one thing. Many people see MVP almost like a prototype however, an MVP to see if people like the concept of something could be as small and simple as a landing page. A landing page with mock ups that asked people if they liked the concept, or a form which people fill in which triggers a manual process behind the scenes by people that create an output without programming. The viability depends on what you are testing and who you are testing it for.</p>

<p>I would suggest that an actual app to test if people like a concept is not 'minimum' that less could be done to test that before even building the app - however, we all tend to stick to our strengths and it may actually be quicker for you to throw together an app than to research how to gather opinions on a screen shot.</p>

<p>It would not be the first time that someone has put out a small app to test if people like a concept. However, I think it has to be carefully managed, that it should be with limited numbers who can have close contact with you to ask questions, give feedback etc.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that feedback on a concept will change dependant on stage - so if you are planning on making this app paid for then people have different considerations. Usually when an app is free then people push for new features, when an app is paid for then they push for stability. The audience changes so you must be sure to ask the right questions of your audience.</p>

<p>so, to summarise:</p>

<p>I would not personally be concerned about someone stealing my idea. But there are legal ways to protect the idea such as patents (which in my experience heavily delay launch and testing)</p>

<p>if testing with an MVP then be sure to know what you are testing for and ask questions of your users to find out what they value in the product (I recommend the book 'The Mom Test', it helps you ask questions of people without them just giving you positive reinforcement)</p>

<p>Can I legally do this without opening a formal company in the US? I'm thinking about starting informal gathering resources through Paypal from my paying customers.</p>
","<p>""Can I legally do this without opening a formal company in the US? I'm thinking about starting informal gathering resources through Paypal from my paying customers.""</p>

<p>The short answer: no, you cannot. Because of the fact that you are operating a business that is <em>doing business</em> in a US based state, you will be expected to be formalized in every way that any other business operating there would need to follow.</p>

<p>One option requires an E2 nonimmigrant visa, or an immigrant EB-5 visa, requiring investments of $200k USD and $500k USD, respectively. These are obviously steep numbers.</p>

<p>There are many other requirements, I'd advise going through the <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/business-law-advisor/starting-business-us-foreign-national"">SBA website</a>. Here is their list of how to start a business as a foreigner:</p>

<p>Steps to Starting Up a Foreign Business in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Foreign business entities are incorporated at the state level in the U.S. The process will vary from state-to-state, but generally involves two steps: applying to register in that particular state, and establishing a registered agent with a valid address in that state (no PO Box numbers). A registered agent can be either the business owner or another person who is authorized to receive legal papers on behalf of the business, such as an attorney or secretary.</p></li>
<li><p>The rest of the steps to starting up are similar to those that an American citizen would take. The breakdown of 10 Steps to Starting a Business includes information on naming your business, requirement licenses and permits, and tax matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Establishing an online retail presence in the U.S. is a popular choice for many foreign business owners. You can read more about general resources for online businesses, including privacy and advertising regulations here, along with specific information on international sales.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I advise to stay within the legal bounds, as it'll end up saving you money in the long run, and feels good on the inside ;)</p>

"Requesting funding for a 'free' app startup","89","","<p>I've been developing a mobile app for the past few months, and I'm wondering at what point do I reach out to investors and try and get funding? I'm a software engineer by day, and entrepreneur by night, so I'm developing this thing alone. Its going well, but as I've been working on this product, ideas for what it can grow into pile up and I realize that I'll need help in order to get this thing off the ground in a reasonable amount of time. So at what point can I reach out for funding?</p>

<p>On top of that, how does one go about pitching an idea for a mobile app that will be free, but introduce ad campaigns later down the road? I know that investors' #1 concern is making money, so it seems to me like a free app would be hard to get funding for. Thanks!</p>
","<p>Freemium and and ad models for apps are common and understood by investors. No need to worry about that.</p>

<p>I would say you should consider achieving at least one of the following milestones before reaching out to investors. The more milestones you accomplish, the better received you will be and the higher your valuation will be. Assuming you earn funding.</p>

<p>The milestones for you to consider are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Working prototype</li>
<li>Market traction (e.g., downloads. 1. 10. 100. 1,000. 10,000. etc.)</li>
<li>Revenue dollars (e.g., again. $1. $10. $100. $1,000. $10,000. etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I will say, if you have earned your first dollar and investors can see a clear path of how investing additional capital can help you grow, you will have a much easier (relatively speaking) time of it.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you don't have a working prototype yet. It will be even more difficult to earn funding.</p>

"Starting a Startup with family investment","89","","<p>I am a programmer and one of my friend who is a good sales guy, we both have planned to start own business.</p>

<p>We both don't have own money to invest but I am offered by a family member.</p>

<p>Please guide from your experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should we start the business with a family member's investment? </li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise in order to generate some revenue, we have to take some projects in parallel of the regular jobs and working on them after office hours. Currently we have got two projects but I personally see it difficult to allocate time as I see more leads are coming too.</p>
","<p>Investments from family and friends are a great way to kick start your startup. The problem is that startups have a very high failure rate (some say 9 out of 10 startups fail). Depending on the financial situation of the family member, having their investment go down the drain can create tension between  you and the family. Since you are in a technical field, the family member may not fully understand your line of work, the risks and your explanation of why it failed. Remember that even if the startup fails, your family member would still be around and you would have to face him/her. </p>

<p>If the family member is fully aware of the risk and is still willing to invest, that may help the situation. Even so, keep a formal investor agreement so that they know their rights and you know yours and it would help solve disputes. If they are unwilling to take the risk and insist on reclaiming their money, a small no interest loan just to cover the cost of projects could be an alternative. </p>

<p>It is always better to scale up with what you have available. That way, you remain in control, maintain equity, have less people to answer to and have the flexibility to take calculated risks. And in the case the startup goes bust, you wouldn't feel bad about loosing your family members money and you can restart another startup quickly.</p>

<p>If you need investments just to cover working capital for your projects, you can also ask customers for some advance to cover your costs and for incremental payments as the project proceeds until you build sufficient working capital to roll projects. If the customers like your product or service, some of them are very understanding of the nature of startups and wouldn't mind. Some founders keep their day jobs or take part time jobs as they build their startup. </p>

"Using public space for placing your product","89","","<p>My startup is developing a product that needs to be placed on a pavement. Think of it as a bus stop.</p>

<p>What kind of authorizations do you think my company would need or what fees should I pay to the city?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The product also need power supply and internet connection.</p>

<p>We're based in London, UK.</p>
","<h2>This is a complicated issue and you would be well-advised to consult a solicitor specialising in planning/construction law.</h2>

<p>If your product provides some sort of public service (whether as a shelter, or through the provision of information etc) then the simplest solution may be to sell or licence it to councils and leave them to worry about obtaining the necessary permissions.</p>

<p>Of course, that approach would likely reduce your gross profit.  If instead you wish to install the items yourself, there are a number of things that you must consider:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66"" rel=""nofollow"">Highways Act 1980</a></strong></p>

<p>Under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/143"" rel=""nofollow"">section 143</a>, you could be ordered (by <a href=""http://www.tfl.gov.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">Transport for London</a> if on a red route, else the local borough council) to remove a structure from the public highway unless it was erected with statutory authority.  The most appropriate source of such statutory authority will depend on exactly what your product does, but a permission from the council under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/115E"" rel=""nofollow"">section 115E</a> is a likely candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the council must first prominently advertise your application (including serving notice on anyone whose premises is likely to be materially affected) and consider all representations made to them (<a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/115G"" rel=""nofollow"">section 115G</a>);</p></li>
<li><p>if the structure will either produce an income* or provide advice or information, <em>consent</em> must be obtained from the owners and occupiers of every premises directly in front of which it is to be sited&mdash;such consent must not be unreasonably withheld, although it may be subject to the payment of a reasonable sum (<a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/115J"" rel=""nofollow"">section 115J</a>);</p></li>
<li><p>if the structure is to be sited on a walkway, then <em>consent</em> must similarly be obtained from the owners and occupiers of every materially affected premises that adjoins the walkway together with the owner of the underlying land; and</p></li>
<li><p>the council may attach such conditions as they see fit, which may include the payment to them of reasonable charges (<a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/115F"" rel=""nofollow"">section 115F</a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You should contact the relevant council's transportation department for further information on what detail they would require in an application and what conditions (including charges) they might wish to impose should it be successful.</p>

<p><sup>* It may be worth noting that, if the structure will not produce an income but does provide some sort of public service, then the council would have been able to erect it themselves using a simpler procedure under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/115F"" rel=""nofollow"">section 115B</a>.</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8"" rel=""nofollow"">Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a></strong></p>

<p>Under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/57"" rel=""nofollow"">section 57</a>, planning permission is required to develop land.  Developing land without planning permission could lead to the council requiring the land be restored to its state prior to the breach.</p>

<p>Under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/90"" rel=""nofollow"">section 90</a>, some types of development are deemed already to have permission.  <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/418"" rel=""nofollow"">The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995</a> provides further details, although it is unlikely that you qualify&mdash;whereas, if the council were to erect the structures, they might under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/418/schedule/2/part/12/made"" rel=""nofollow"">Schedule 3, Part 12</a>.</p>

<p>It is likely that you will therefore have to apply to the council for planning permission, which must similarly be advertised with representations considered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/contents/made"" rel=""nofollow"">The Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 2007</a></strong></p>

<p>Under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/regulation/4/made"" rel=""nofollow"">regulation 4</a>, displays of advertisements require planning consent from the council (or Secretary of State) unless it is deemed to have been granted under <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/regulation/6/made"" rel=""nofollow"">regulation 6</a> (e.g. it falls within <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/schedule/3/made"" rel=""nofollow"">Schedule 3</a>, such as the Class 9 requirements for ""advertisements on highway structures"").  You are likely to obtain such permission together with that for developing the land, above.</p>

<p>Unauthorised display of an advertisement is an offence under the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8"" rel=""nofollow"">Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>; any person found guilty of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to £2,500 upon conviction in the Magistrates’ Court and up to £250/day should the offence continue after a first conviction.</p></li>

<p>If the structure will ""sell or 
expose or offer for sale any article"" or ""supply or offer to supply any service"" for gain or reward, then you are probably required (under section 23) to obtain a street trading licence from the council.  The fees for such licences (in addition to the application fee) varies from council to council (and indeed, within a borough, between specific sites and purposes), but indications for central London can be gleaned from <a href=""http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/download/asset?asset_id=2869372"" rel=""nofollow"">Camden</a> and <a href=""https://www.westminster.gov.uk/street-trading-pitch-fees"" rel=""nofollow"">Westminster</a>.</p>

<p>Unlicensed trading is an offence under section 38; any person found guilty of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to £1,000 on conviction in the Magistrates' Court.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suggest you contact the licensing and planning departments at the relevant council(s) and begin a conversation: my experience has been that they are usually extremely helpful.  If your idea is particularly innovative, you may wish to invite them (together with councillors, the mayor(s), etc) to a promotional event where your product and ideas can be demonstrated/presented.</p>

","<p>No, as far as I know, these job adjectives are in <strong>no way standardized</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Junior Developer</strong> typically solves smaller problems (probably with the guidance of a Senior Developer or an Architect) and isn't expected to design the architecture of a whole app.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the dilution of the stock held by investor X?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is called a ""down round."" The company is accepting new investment at a lower valuation than the previous round. </p>

<p>Assuming all parties agree, the new investor Y now owns 10% at a $1MM valuation. That means that the previous investor owns 10% of the remaining shares. Since the remaining shares are 90% of the current valuation of $1MM (90% x $1MM = $900k), the previous investor X owns 10% of $900k = $90k. </p>

<p>Considering that most startups fail, it's not a bad deal for an investor that is not prepared to invest more for a startup that needs it. And generally the alternative is that Investor X has their investment disappear - if the new investor does not participate, the company sounds like it will likely fail. </p>

<p>Result: after Investor Y provides $100k for 10%, here is the result:</p>

<p>Investor Y -> 10% = $100k</p>

<p>Investor X -> 9% = $90k</p>

<p>Corporate Treasury/Others -> 81% = $810k</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If you are looking to have Investor X and Investor Y have equal ownership, then Investor Y should buy 10% of the existing shares. Since Investor X purchased 10%, Investor X and Investor Y will have equal ownership.</p>

</ol>

<p>I guess 3) will be the most helpful right now. Any ideas that can help me find a useful co-founder are very welcome. Thank you.</p>
","<p>That is a really great question.  You'll first want to determine what you want in a co-founder.  There is no checklist for what to look for in a co-founder, it depends on your product, your skill gaps, whether you will be seeking capital, exit strategy, location, etc.  With that in hand you can then narrow down where you could search.  If you are looking for a business/finance co-founder then you can likely scratch github.  It sounds like you are a tech founder, you will find it easier to find a business co-founder much easier than the reverse.  I frequently see posts by an ""idea guy"" looking for a techie to join them, rarely the reverse.  </p>

<p>Angel.co and cofounderslab.com are online platforms that include ""match.com for founders"" capability.  I have used Angel.co to make some connections, so might be worth a look for you.  I also attend some local meetups with a focus on startups.  Another avenue could be co-working space that targets the startup community.

","<p>It might be helpful to look at the way some of the premium Wordpress themes (for example) work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free 'lite' themes typically have a limited number of elements that you can change to differentiate your site - background image, header, colors, etc.</li>
<li>The premium version of the same theme typically adds more options (which exponentially increases the number of 'unique' websites, as you can mix and match more options).</li>
</ul>

<p>If your <strong><em>primary service is helping your customers get a website up</em></strong> and going, <strong>and</strong> that is the way a) you advertise it and b) they understand it, it is often assumed that the <strong>'basic' level is pretty basic, and uncustomizable</strong> (think Yahoo webstores, etc). Offering <strong>extra customization as an upgrade</strong> would be a pretty standard marketing system.</p>

<p>Two things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to <strong>manage your customers expectations</strong> (don't hype the customization if it's not available yet, but focus on what you believe the <strong>minimum viable product is <em>for your market</em></strong> - a website with features just for your given industry niche?)</li>
<li><strong>Many people want a 'uniquely standard' website</strong>. In other words, they don't want it to look just like their neighbors, but they want it to have the same general look and feel as a 'good website' in their industry.

","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm very concerned about the legal laws from some countries that I should adapt as well</p>

<p><em>In theory</em>, you must comply with the laws of the country you're operating in. Which has a double meaning: you must comply with the laws of the country you're in, of course; you must also comply with the laws your clients are in.</p>

<p>The key case to be aware of is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LICRA v Yahoo!</a>. A French anti-racist group, the LICRA, went after Yahoo for enabling US sellers to offer nazi goods. Doing so is legal in the US (first amendment) but criminal in France (most of Europe has anti hate speech laws). They sued in France and won. Yahoo tried to appeal in the US and got booted. Ergo, comply with the laws of where your clients are in addition to the laws of the country you're in.</p>

<p>But that's only theory. Jurisprudence is still evolving on this topic, and what counts in practice is whether the client's country can flex its diplomatic muscle.</p>

<p>A few concrete examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>US companies aren't making their English websites comply with Sharia law because an occasional visitor might browse it from Saudi Arabia.</p></li>
<li><p>But US companies as large as Google, Facebook, or Twitter do bend over to accommodate e.g. China.</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. all operate an EU subsidiary and EU-based servers, because they don't want their US-based operations to comply with the EU's stricter privacy laws.</p></li>

"What is the exact role of UX experts in a startup context?","88","","<p>I had a conversation with a teammate about the methodology used in a context of new product built by big company. </p>

<p>No need to enter in the details, I explained that Lean Startup principles could (should?) really apply for big companies especially in B2C context since meaning of startup is:<br>
""working under conditions of extreme uncertainty"". </p>

<p>I said that even if the company's Business department gets an idea (about a mobile app for instance) and expects from their IT teams to concretise it, in an ideal world following Lean Startup methodology, the Business dept. members themselves should go out, look for and talk to customers in order to get early feedbacks on the idea/product. They master their idea, so they are the most suitable piece to confront it to outside. </p>

<p>Response from my teammate:<br>
""No, it's the role of recruited UX experts to talk to customers and confront the (disruptive?) idea!""</p>

<p>According to me, UX experts deal with the ergonomics of the solution, the usability.<br>
They might need real customers to test and improve their solutions, but they are not expected to confront the idea to customers initially. 
According to me, Business members should be focused on: ""Should I build this product?"".<br>
UX should be focused on: ""How to improve this product?"".</p>

<p>I'm confused so.<br>
Am I wrong about the exact role of UX experts?<br>
Should the Business stay on his chair without meeting real potential customers? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Am I wrong about the exact role of UX experts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The marketer / Customer Developer's job is to pin down what clients want, in terms of ""I need to do this and that, can you help me solve this please, and I will pay you $x to do so?"" In other words, slap a price in front of a user need, and bring it up internally.</p>

<p>The engineer's job is then to dive into it, make sure it's feasible, and if so come up with a solution in front that costs less than $x.</p>

<p>If that moves forward then the UX expert's job then is - or at the same time is - to pin down how they could do it better (aka, typically, in less steps). Because let's face it, most - though thankfully not all - engineers suck at UX. They ensure it's still less than $x all while making it highly more likely you'll find more customers.</p>

<blockquote>

"Equity sharing between founder and investor at idea stage","87","","<p>So I want to start an IT company - in an established domain (Wordpress themes/plugins) and need capital for it to establish and grow until it becomes profitable. While I do this, I'll also need to pay myself regular salary while I work on it. The money that I'm looking for will keep the company afloat for about a year, hopefully by then it will already become profitable.</p>

<p>When I reached a group of potential investors (3) (friends of friend) they are proposing me that: <code>we all invest equal amount of money and we share equal equity of 25% (including myself)</code>. Since I do not have money to invest myself right now, they are okay with me investing my share later on.</p>

<p>This seems fair in a way that - we all are going to invest equal amount of money and get equal share - plus I will <code>also get salary for running the company</code>.</p>

<p>However part of me says that - since I'll be running the company from inception to growing it to what it can become, and as  the only solo founder working on it full time and invest years building it - while they are mostly only going to invest and help with only occasional involvements while keeping their full-time job - <code>I should be getting majority of the ownership vs them as an investor getting &lt;50% in total</code>.</p>

<p>While the situation is - without the money I won't be able to run the company and it's not too easy to get funding. Also at this point the company is nothing but an idea and proposal.</p>

<p>Help me analyse the options please.</p>
","<p>As they are essentially equity investors (not working on the product/service themselves) rather than founders then you would leave yourself in a position of being near un-invest-able in the future.</p>

<p>Any future investors would look at your cap table and realise that the sole founder (you) only held 25% stake of their own company and that 75% of the equity was held by individuals with zero day to day involvement in the business - so 75% of the equity is not working towards the day to day success of the business and as such is wasted. </p>

<p>Also any future investment would dilute the founder further into the position of having very little up side on exit or any motivation beyond the coolness of the project and the salary they are bringing in. This is not a long term investment or the founder could simply be replaced by staff on lower wages.</p>

<p>Seed round investment, in my opinion, should leave the founding team with more than 90% of the equity available in order to give them somewhere to grow and give the appearance of being able to take investment (unless the investment had many zeros).</p>

<p>Even if you are not looking for future investment the appearance of being able to accept investment automatically pushes potential acquisition offers higher as a buyer knows that you can reject their bid, take investment and increase your value further without having to sell.</p>

<p>My advice to you would be to maintain control of your business. I would do so by introducing your investors to the SAFE agreement (<a href=""https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/</a>). This stops you from having to value your company initially (which is impossible) and puts checks and balances in place to look after your investors when you grow. As in, they get a better deal (discount and/or preferences) on the equity next round when a more experienced investor comes on board and can negotiate more fairly on their behalf. It will also reduce the need for lawyers early on as the documents are straight forward.</p>

<p>I would also look at putting in place an agreement between yourselves and your investors in which you have a board of directors (these do not have to be shareholders). Essentially the board makes decisions about the business rather than the shareholders although shareholders (as a group) can reserve the right to place a member on the board - they would usually reserve this right until the sh*t hits the fan and they are saving their investment rather than up front.
This means that you are not outnumbered by shareholders who have no day to day involvement or perhaps understanding of any aspect of the business. You can make decisons, give updates and reports to your shareholders and be held accountable by the board of directors. Each month you send out a share holder report updating them on your progress, any actions you agreed to take etc. The report early (when the board is essentially you) on will be lightweight and update on key metrics. As you get a larger board or chairperson these reports can be more formalised with meeting agendas and such.</p>

<p>The key thing here is to get the strategy right ahead of your idea. understand that investment does not give them control of the business, it should give them influence and that you must look after your own equity stake because investors like an incentivised founding team.</p>

<p>Good luck, it sounds like a difficult position to negotiate from</p>

"Finding a new market to an existing product","87","","<p>We built a SaaS for healthcare providers. This is a small bootstrapped business of two people. </p>

<p>The core tech of the service is file transfer and task routing. The software transfers digital medical studies (e.g. ECG, MRI) between a clinic and a remote reading physician (or radiologist.) The system is entirely web-based but includes a file uploader application for Windows.</p>

<p>We have a handful of small private clinics as paying clients. After a year of intensive sales, we’ve found out that return on effort is very low. It’s very challenging to scale in the highly regulated medical field, especially without strong connections.</p>

<p>We think of shifting to a different market and explore other niches (photo retouching, noise reduction in audio). However we lack domain knowledge. It also seems that the market size isn’t large enough to sustain a business.</p>

<p>How do you research a new niche to already existing product?</p>
","<p>First up, I wouldn't discount your product-vertical niche just yet. Staying in your existing vertical would be ideal, since you have the experience and the case studies</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps getting in with one or more of the CROs, though they likely have established links with pharma companies already. CROs are always looking for ways to improve efficiency and with increased levels of diagnostics recorded for clinical trials, this could be worthwhile. </li>
<li>Contact one of the smaller health insurance companies. They might be interested in efficiency savings in terms of workflow and 'data/document' handling (sorry to be vague about what you do)</li>
<li>Contact one of the smaller private hospital networks (I'm thinking here of someone like Benenden, though they are also an insurer) who may not have good systems and will be interested in improving their technology.</li>
<li>Find some niche medical facilities that you can establish a presence in, especially ones that might have a high margin - fertility, occupational health, ... </li>
</ul>

<p>Look to establish partnerships with related businesses, that might enable you to scale your business. Ultimately you want to increase automation so you can handle larger clients. </p>

<p>You mention 'without strong connections', I suspect you won't readily have connections in other verticals, so these will take time to create.</p>

<p>A few ideas on other verticals or routes to market ... </p>

<ul>
<li>Search the internet for things that are similar to what you do that are in a market that has some space or margin in a different vertical. You would end up as their competitors, but that is OK. If you consider the 'wealth' of the vertical as well - e.g. banking, investments, insurance, telecoms tend to be wealthy and have higher margins, as compared to charities, retail and real estate.</li>
<li>Look for a partner company who can bundle your software up within their product/service, then take a cut of their T/O, effectively they will be doing sales for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's complicated, but I think to break into another vertical will be challenging, especially since you don't have an established network in the other vertical. Plus there is the added work of modifying your product for another vertical.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I've answered your question in the way it was intended, but best of luck!</p>

<p>Am I approaching this wrong and is there another way to get good quality content from freelancers?</p>
","<p>The problem may have less to do with your approach than it has to do with your budget.</p>

<p>Good writers tend to charge by the page or article much like good freelance engineers tend to charge by the day or week. Further, clients tend to find excellent writers rather than the other way around, so the odds of locating them on sites like Zerys are slim.</p>

<p>I'd also stress that nurturing arresting content that will grab your audience's interest takes time and research. If you're getting paid by the word, your incentive is to expedite and botch doing so. Worse still, your incentive is to turn short and to the point sentences into entire paragraphs. That makes for abysmal copy that no half-decent writer would want to author -- let alone sign.</p>

<p>Lastly, the trick to finding good authors is to hunt them down. When you enjoy reading a blog post or a news article, email its author and ask if they're available for freelance work.</p>

"Shares in a partnership business","87","","<p>I am seeking for a advice on a issue raised due to allocating shares in a partnership business among 4 best friends.</p>

B is inputting 160K, and at UAE.
C is inputting 40K
D is inputting 40K
</code></pre>

<p>A has no roles and responsibilities.
B will do the purchasing once in 3 months or once in 6 months or as the stock finishes.
C and D will be conducting the daily operation and sales.</p>

<pre><code>The shares that was allocated considering the money and effort was,
A - 20%
B - 40%
C - 20%
D - 20%
</code></pre>

<p>And it came in the following manner</p>

<pre><code>Capital Share from 400K - A 40%, B 40%, C 10%, D 10% 

Effort Share - A - 0%, B - 40%, C 30%, D%30

so Capital + Effort share  = 40%, 80%, 40%, 40% out of 200

so out of 100 = 20,40,20,20. %
</code></pre>

<p>so the 2 problems that raised are,</p>

<p>1/ B is only doing purchasing once in 3 months or 6 months or as soon as stocks finish. C and D says Operation and Sales task are daily on going work and time consuming, so how can someone working in once in 3 months or 6 months have a greater effort share than Daily on going time consuming tasks. so they are demanding for more than purchasing or to reduce the purchasing share.</p>

<p>so isn't it fare to go for a percentage of </p>

<pre><code>Capital Share from 400K - A 40%, B 40%, C 10%, D 10% 

Effort Share - A - 0%, B - 20%, C 40%, D% 40

so final profit/loss share will be 20%, 30%, 25%, 25% ?
</code></pre>

<p>2/ having two separate shares for Ownership &amp; Profit. 2 partners are saying to merge it and keep only Ownership share, the other 2 are saying only capital is counted for Ownership share so there should be both Ownership share and Profit/Loss Share</p>

<p>Please advice.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://foundrs.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a tool you could use</a>. The problem with it in this situation is it doesn't allow you to combine effort and capital into a single variable to use for allocation of ownership.</p>

<p>I suggest you use the following process to arrive at an ownership allocation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Value the entire company in dollars.</li>
<li>Authorize a specific number of <strong><em>shares</em></strong> available to be issued.</li>
<li>Sell shares to investors on the basis of the total company valuation and the number of shares outstanding.</li>
<li>Agree, moving forward, on the dollar value of each founder's effort. This can be on a per hour, per diem or per project basis.</li>
<li>Pay owners contributing sweat equity in shares.</li>
<li>Forget about trying to allocate ownership based on <strong><em>percentages</em></strong>. It's too confusing and impracticable. Use shares instead. Percentages are the <strong><em>result</em></strong> of the share allocation. They do not drive share allocation.</li>

<p>There's some psychology about this as well, iirc the Hartman model, applied to companies. Basically you want all different personalities in your company - but all companies have a preference.

It matters little if your product or service is new or something they're familiar with.</p>

<p>Still, you're correct when assessing that it's easier to introduce something that isn't entirely unique: lots of competition usually means there's lots of demand. More often than not, it also leaves a lot of wiggle room for new entrants to differentiate and conquer narrow niche markets.</p>

Like, say, Microsoft wouldn't mind a former employee saying ""I worked at Microsoft for ten years."" But if we're talking smaller businesses for whom you've consulted, you could always reach out to them. Presumably you left on good terms if you're looking to advertise your time working with them, so just ask ""hey, is it alright if I list you as a company I've done work for in the past?"" and they'll probably say yes. It's free advertising for them, too.</p>

"What are the possible risks of establishing an online fashion store?","86","","<p>Suppose, I want to import product from China and sell it to the local market through an online business.</p>

<p>First, I establish an web-site. Then, I import product from China and keep it in my store hoping to sell.</p>

<p>What risks can I face?</p>

<p>I am concerted about possibility of low customers or low sales.</p>
","<p>I could think about the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Market/Customers/Competitors</li>
<li>Quality/Laws</li>
<li>Resources/Investment/warehousing</li>
</ul>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Market/Customers/Competitors</li>
</ol>

<p>The market is saturated. There are already thousands of stores and everyone wants to sell substitute goods. You need to do high investment into your marketing to gain market shares or have some niche products. Still success it is not guaranteed. It is a hard fight.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Quality/Laws</li>
</ol>

<p>Especially when importing unknown brands, you may get big problems in terms of warranty. Same goes for own products. Selling existing brands, gets us back to the first problem: High competition.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Resources/Investment/Warehousing</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok this is a tough topic. Of course you can sell things, but you need to stock up some goods. You have to invest into a lot of things, to implement some kind of distribution chain. Of course you can outsource it, but you still have to pay for such a service. Also you have to create a portal and IT-Infrastructure. Simple solutions may also work, but professional Online Stores are build up with complex software and lets just say: ""There is a reason for that"". (exp. Magento)</p>

<p>Overall, there are many risks and uncertainties. May change the approach and realize some kind of affiliate concept, but this is also fiercely contested. There is a lot to think about.</p>

<p>Does this answer the question?</p>

","<p><strong>1- Can you please suggest what am I supposed to do?</strong></p>

<p>I would suggest you to go and work for a Dev shop, first of all, this will gave you the money to pay for the things you need for your personal project. But more importantly, you will grow your professional network and, if you pay attention, you can learn from the mistakes that the owners or managers of the Dev Shop make.</p>

<p><strong>2- What should I be aware of?</strong> </p>

<p>Starting a business is more than just having the idea and creating the product or paying for the stuff that the product need (hosting, domains, etc...), you need to know about management, marketing, sales or niche specific things or process. And then there is the chance that even if your idea is awesome for you, other people may find it not useful.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is about your competitors, who are they?, where are they?, what are they doing?, remember that if you got the idea, other people may have it too, or will get it later and may have more resources to beat you out of business.</p>

<p><strong>3- Is it better to work as a developer for a company than starting my own big project?</strong></p>

<p>In short... Yes, but not forever, if you want to create your own business, go for it, but you need to have at least the basic know-how about what you want to do. I've worked for 3 different small companies, and I can tell you that I've learned a lot from the owner/manager decisions or actions. Those things are helping me with my new business idea.</p>

<p><strong>4- If there is any recommended resources to learn everything about building startups, can you please share with me?</strong></p>

In some instances, an LLC doing nothing other than holding your interest in the C Corp may be treated as a personal holding company, which subjects it to different taxation than an LLC doing other types of business. You should contact an accountant, as well.</p>

<p>Short version: get professional advice from both a lawyer and an accountant before proceeding. Either course of action could have big implications for your finances, so it's important to get professional help tailored to your specific situation.

","<p>While I was getting my MBA, I spent half the time building a web-based business, so it is certainly possible to do both.  After I completed my studies I did the business full-time after that.</p>

<p>If your business requires that you be in the specific location and you have the ability to execute that business idea (i.e. money, etc), then you might have to refocus your college for a more local one.  Initially you may be depending on other people to operate the business part of the time.</p>

<p>If you opt to go to college and hold off starting the business, you have to ask yourself if it's probable that someone else would start a similar business.</p>

<p>If it's no probable, then you might at least start college while building out the business plan and having a much stronger business case before you start executing.</p>

<p>If played right, any amount of college can help you get a better idea of what needs to be done for your business so you start it with a strong financial base.  You might try to focus your initial classes on those which will help with your business idea (Accounting, Finance, others).</p>

"Does a domain name give brand trademark rights?","84","","<p>I registered a second level domain and my goal is to sell some products which will be ""branded"" with that name. So I will develop my website and use it to promote my future business.
I aim to be the only one who will be allowed to sell products with that name and use it with any kind of commercial purposes.
I didn't registered the brand nor purchased any trademark or any other license which may ensure that to me officially, I just registered the second level domain with the .com extension:</p>

<ul>
<li>Given that I registered the second level domain with the .com extension before any other company/enterprise, may it be enough to prevent someone else's usage of the same brand for commercial purposes? In other terms, should I purchase a trademark and register the name or may I not worry about it, for nobody can have a commercial website with such name?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Buying a domain name, on its own, gives you nothing in terms of trademark rights.</p>

<p>If you are in the U.S., then launching the website and selling products under that name will give you common law trademark rights, and this will give you some protection in preventing others from using the name.</p>

<p>If you are in the U.S., then should also get a registered trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office.  This will give you additional protections above and beyond the common law rights.  Registering a trademark is easy to do and relatively inexpensive among the tasks you hire lawyers for.</p>

<p>Most other countries have very different trademark systems than the US.  Most other countries don't have common law trademarks rights so the only way to get protection is to register a trademark in your country.</p>

<p>If your sales are international, then you may want to register your trademark in multiple countries.</p>

<p>Note that even if you have a registered trademark in all countries of the world, that does NOT prevent other companies from using the same name.  It only prevents other companies from using similar names for similar products.  For example, if you are selling toothpaste, then you probably can't prevent another company from using the same name to sell car tires.</p>

<p>It's not very rare that the judges of a startup pitching event appear uninterested. In fact, it is a very common scenario. </p>

<p>So, these are some ways in which you can attract their attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a quirky (and/or) an interesting quote/caption, which would get their attention, atleast for a few seconds. (If in doubt, see how the SharkTank contestants start their pitches)</li>
<li>Then, you should be able to hold that attention for the next four minutes. Do something really out-of-the-box while demonstrating the product. Always pitch as if the judge would use your product afterwards. (Again, see how the contestants of SharkTank weave up scenarios where they show the judges using their product, and the benefits they get out of it.)</li>
<li>If possible(if you have an MVP ready), make the judges try it out. It helps them to both stretch and help you continue to demand their attention.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, try and try and try to keep the pitch interactive with the judges. Make them answer interesting questions, and show them how the product/idea answers their questions. </p>

"Picking the right product for marketing automation","84","","<p>I'm a developer.  I need to setup some marketing automation in my product such that when new users come into my app I want to put them on a program that I will market to them as a new user.  So for example, someone signs up a free trial.  I send them the welcome email with some instructions on what to do next.  Based on what they do in the app, like if they  complete some tasks in my app I want to send them another email telling them what to do next.  If they don't complete these tasks I want to send them a reminder, etc.</p>

<p>Now I could certainly program all of the behavior myself which would make this a stupid question. But, I'm trying to evaluate products I could use that might help with this task.  My main objective is to allow marketing to modify the look and content of the email, but I'm wondering how much of the logic could I push to them.  If I can let them handle some of the logic then that makes the solution more flexible as the campaigns change.  If I simply handled all logic and let them only handle the email being sent it's a clear division of labor, but that means when they want to tweak the rules I have to go change code.</p>

<p>Currently marketing is using Mailchimp already and I've looked through their API, but it's mostly focused on maintaining email lists which I'm not sure that's the best idea.  I think with Mandrill I can quite simply have a series of templates that I maybe able to choose from and I would direct which template to invoke (simple division of labor case).  After staring at their docs it's not clear if this is the best choice.</p>

<p>So I started to look at others Hubspot, etc.  But I got so tired of reading their marketing speak about a marketing product I wanted to shoot myself.  I just need the straight dope from a technical person about what is the best way to approach this without all of the marketing BS.  I want someone to talk to my situation.  Can anyone give me some guidance on what they did to accomplish this?  What products did you use and how did you use them (ie what is your division of labor in logic vs look)?  How did you use their API to integrate with their product?</p>
","<p>You want to look at Intercom.io (<a href=""http://intercom.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intercom.io</a>) or Customer.io (<a href=""http://customer.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://customer.io</a>).</p>

<p>A number of SaaS products use these tools for onboarding, behavior based messaging, and in-app notifications/announcements.</p>

<p>I saw this last at Pingometer (<a href=""http://pingometer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pingometer.com</a>) which is the uptime monitor for all of my servers/websites. When I first signed up, I got an email welcoming me. I didn't log in for a few days and got another email saying they missed me. Then, I logged back in and setup my first monitor to keep an eye on a server. A couple days after that, I got a personalized message introducing me to features I hadn't explored yet. Pretty cool...</p>

<p>To implement both products, you basically push a bunch of tags/events via their API.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login (Push ""Login"" Tag)</li>
<li>Click Dashboard (Push ""Dashboard"" Tag)</li>
<li>Click Pricing (Push ""Pricing"" Tag)</li>
<li>Use Feature #1 (Push ""Feature #1"" Tag)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can create rules to trigger automated emails (e.g. all users who completed #1 and then completed #4 within X days get an email about other features to try).</p>

<p>The trick with implementation is to push tags for almost all possible actions in your application.</p>

<p>This way, you don't need to define the rules right away but the data is there if you need/want it later.</p>

<p>You manage everything (rules) from Intercom.io or Customer.io and don't have to mess with the code on your side later on.</p>

","<p>Short answer: No need, beyond having a clear leading mind(s).</p>

<p>I believe a hierarchy is just to emerge by itself, based on members experience and egos. At that size, emergence and self-organization seem a good bet to stay lean and focused.</p>

<p>Having said that, it is also critical to keep the focus. So a corollary to your question is do you need a clear leader to summarize the situation and decide where the team goes---to which here is a resounding yes.</p>

<p>I am currently working at a company where we all agree not to have a hierarchy. We want to foster everyone taking part in the discussions. This works pretty well, and quickly we know each other's strengths, preferences, and perspectives.</p>

This way you can devote all your energy towards one goal and the chances of success increase dramatically. This sounds very nice and logical, however I feel like I could pursue two ideas at the same time. </p>

<p>Reading stories like Elon Musk is CEO of 2 companies definitely makes me think about how good those advice really are.</p>

<p>Should I go for it?</p>
","<p>Depends on your situation.</p>

<p>Yes, Elon Musk is heavily involved in multiple companies. But he was a multi-millionaire before he got involved with those companies (and remember he didn't found Tesla, he was a series A investor and didn't become CEO until 2008). Companies that have now have many thousands of employees. Musk has a lot of resources to hand to deal with the day-to-day tasks, leaving him free to focus on strategy. Musk isn't trying to ""make it"" — he's made it. Long before he was involved in Tesla &amp; Space X.</p>

<p>That's not the typical situation for the average startup.</p>

<p>There you have very limited resources. Time, money and people. If you split those over multiple projects, then you reduce the chances of any one of those projects succeeding. </p>

<p>It sometimes makes sense to explore multiple assumptions at the same time, because making the wrong bet and having to back-track and start again can be more expensive than exploring two options at the same time. But that's something where you're very explicitly weighing costs and benefits — not a generally ""good idea"".</p>

<p>The simplest example that pops to mind, for me anyway, is addresses. I don't know whether this is relevant for you or not, but imagine you needed to represent someone's location on their social profile. If you were designing with the United States as an end-goal, you'd probably be fine asking users to enter their zip code. That might even seem totally fine as a default choice. But if you then scale out and start looking at any other country, you'll likely find that their format for postal codes is very different. By keeping your target of ""anywhere and everywhere"" in mind from the get-go, you'll be more able to make good choices early-on about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Another good example is the notoriously difficult problem of localization. A lot of startups might start off with code that's pretty heavily dependent on the user's language being English, then add localization as an after-thought. By knowing you're targeting lots of people, you'll probably make that investment earlier rather than later, and save some time down the road.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question, yes, you should be targeting only a small area first (particularly for a social network, I'd much rather have a thousand users in a single city, than a thousand users dispersed randomly across a thousand cities), but that doesn't mean it's not worth knowing what your eventual plan is.</p>

<p>I can't really tell you which of these your stakeholder might have meant, of course, but I wouldn't be so quick to write it off.</p>

<hr />

<p>I guess I posted this without really mentioning another key point: some people--ahem--just don't understand some things like this. Some people believe, erroneously I think, that launching to a huge target all at once is a good approach. There's definitely merit to that, don't get me wrong, but I think generally, it's best to start small and grow as quickly as your user-base allows you to. That gives you a solid period to work out any bugs that make it that far, and it lets you test the waters more seriously than watering down your audience by geographically dispersing them.</p>

<p>So I wouldn't be too surprised if your stakeholders felt that was the best approach, but in a lot of cases, I would disagree. That said, to be perfectly clear with my point here, it is very good to know that plan ahead of time.</p>

"How to value a startup venture?","83","","<p>I'm trying to calculate the value of my startup, so that I can determine how much equity to give up to finance things. Just as a summary, this is a software startup, which requires £150,000 to develop the product, making it market ready. The initial offer I've been given from a potential investor (although only an opening offer), is 70% for them, 30% for me.</p>

<p>I know there are many ways to calculate the potential value of an idea. I'm looking at the current market and our competitor. For example, the competitor charges around £50,000 per year for their solution. The investor claims they have 30 clients that want to leave the competitor, who would come to us instead - this is part of the investors promise, financing and clients to sell to. </p>

<p>So, over a year, we have the potential to generate £1.5m in revenue. Who knows what else we could do after year 1. I also appreciate we may not get all these clients, especially not all on day 1. But for arguments sake, let's say that the value of the idea is £1.5m, based on the investors promise of 30 clients and the average cost of the solution that the competitor currently charges.</p>

<p>That would mean their £150,000 investment is worth more or less 10% (for easier maths). Maybe 20% if we can only get 15 of the 30 clients. I appreciate 10%-20% is rather low, but surely 70% is too high?</p>

<p>Am I looking at this in the wrong way or am I on the right tracks?</p>
","<p>Valuation of a start up is not necessarily scientific when it comes to raising investment. It is essentially a negotiation.</p>

<p>However, the negotiation would tend to take a familiar pattern when it comes to experienced investors.</p>

<p>Either, the investor makes a reasonable offer that maintains the founders crontrol over their own business with certain protections in place. Such as: preferential shares which mean they get their money out when you exit first before anything is divided up, ratchet clauses which protect them if the next round is a lower valuation, the option to put someone on the board to give them influence in decisions, investing by the mechanism of a comvertable loan which is either paid back by the founder or converted to equity at a discount to the next round etc</p>

<p>Or, they say it is not for them and give reasons why. Such as: the valuation would end up giving them too much of your company demotivating you and killing the business, they need another investor in first before they'd commit, they dont think the idea is good, it's not scaleable, they dont invest in this industry (I've heard them all unfortunately).</p>

<p>Anything outside of the above is unusual and would make me question the experience of the investor themselves, what previous deals they had made and I would be looking for references from people they had invested in in the past.</p>

<p>but back onto valuation:</p>

<p>Valuation at the earliest stage is extremely difficult and extremely risky for the investor. This is why there is a trend towards convertible loans as a form of investment rather than straight up equity. It allows valution to wait until a later time when more is known about the business.
This way, the negotiation is less around the current valuation of the business but instead negotiates what discount will be given on the more accurate valuation of the next round. While also negotiating what other protections the investor would need in place in order to feel comfortable making the deal.</p>

<p>In most cases if someone has the money and interest in the idea then a deal can be struck, but if your starting point is losing control of your business and selling a 70% stake straight off then you'd have nowhere to go after that.</p>

","<p>Yes, that is a red flag.  The number of shares you are receiving is meaningless without knowing the percentage.  I would push back on this.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if it is a good salary, then maybe you don't need to care so much.  You are probably getting a very small percentage of shares (otherwise they'd be more open about it), and the likelihood of them ever being worth anything is small (a high percentage of startups fail). So you can be happy with your good salary, have a good experience at a startup, and might get a bonus someday via the shares.</p>

<p>That is a great idea - as long as part of the paperwork you are not collecting any user information - I think you should be OK. If you do collect I would recommend you at least have an LLC setup (assuming you are in US). check with an attorney for details.</p>

<p>If your financial partner or someone in the pipeline messes up with your Client's information including financial information - it will hurt you. I strongly suggest an LLC.</p>

"Why don't tech startup founders in America go somewhere cheaper?","83","","<p>I know this question is a bit specific, but hear me out!</p>

<p>I'm a software developer in NYC. It's really expensive to hire engineers in America, and I'm wondering why startups just start off by hiring foreign (Russian, Chinese, Indian) labor or even moving to Russia, China, or India to start their startup, while doing business in the US? Lets say the language barrier and assimilation was not an issue for the person trying to found this company, wouldn't this save so much money / risk? You could pay foreign labor costs while making American money.</p>

<p>I ask this because I'm bilingual in Chinese and English, and I want to venture off into my own business (probably a tech startup) eventually. Given that I don't mind living in China or Taiwan, couldn't I minimize so much risk (paying $500 per engineer per month instead of $6,000-$10,000) by just moving there and paying for labor there while targeting American customers? I could hire like a team of engineers there for the price of one American engineer. Essentially if I'm going to start a Whatsapp, it's not like I have to be the US to publish my app in America and get American customers, right?</p>

<p>What's the deal? Or is this a history issue, that 2nd generation bilingual Americans haven't caught up to this idea yet and I'm ahead of my time? I'm sure many people have done this (My coworker is Russian American and her sister is starting her own business. Her only engineer right now is in Russia), but it doesn't seem to come up as often as I would expect.</p>
","<p>Many startups do outsource the work to third party off shore development 
centers or setup an offshore development center of their own. Here are a few reasons why startups may not doing this more frequently</p>

<ol>
<li>Unfamiliarity</li>

<p>A startup needs to develop the product and sell it. If you move your whole office to a location where the developers are cheap then could be moving away from your market.

Most startups are too small to have the startup capital to fund this. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the main purpose of trademark law is to avoid consumer confusion, and the fundamental question in any trademark infringement lawsuit is whether the defendant's use of a trademark creates a likelihood of confusion between the defendant's goods or services and the plaintiff's.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from that, the article speaks about trademark dilution as another reason for lawsuits.</p>

<p>So let's state this clearly - the two main reasons to get sued for trademark violation are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>consumer confusion</p></li>
<li><p>trademark dilution</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If Sriracha is a trademark and you call your toothpaste Sriracha Toothpaste, you are definitly confusing the consumers by suggesting that your toothpaste is affiliated with Sriracha. </p>

<p>The defense of making clear it's not your trademark might work in some theoretical cases, but only if it's very very very clear. So call your toothpaste ""Sriracha (warning: no affiliation with sriracha TM) toothpaste"" and you  might eventually be fine. Put it somewhere on the tube where noone reads it - you will probably not be fine. </p>

<p>The cited article is not talking about advertising your product with another one's trademark, it is talking about critics and blog posts where it's clear from the whole context that no affiliation exists.</p>

<p>Another explanation, right from the uspto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I know whether I'm infringing?</p>
  
  <p>To support a trademark infringement claim in court, a plaintiff must prove that it owns a valid mark, that it has priority (its rights in the mark(s) are ""senior"" to the defendant's), and that the defendant's mark is likely to cause confusion in the minds of consumers about the source or sponsorship of the goods or services offered under the parties' marks. When a plaintiff owns a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register, there is a legal presumption of the validity and ownership of the mark as well as of the exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the registration. These presumptions may be rebutted in the court proceedings.</p>
  
  <p>Generally, the court will consider evidence addressing various factors to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion among consumers. The key factors considered in most cases are the degree of similarity between the marks at issue and whether the parties' goods and/or services are sufficiently related that consumers are likely to assume (mistakenly) that they come from a common source. Other factors that courts typically consider include how and where the parties' goods or services are advertised, marketed, and sold; the purchasing conditions; the range of prospective purchasers of the goods or services; whether there is any evidence of actual confusion caused by the allegedly infringing mark; the defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and the strength of the plaintiff's mark.</p>
  
  <p>The particular factors considered in a likelihood-of-confusion determination, as well as the weighing of those factors, vary from case to case. And the amount and quality of the evidence involved can have a significant impact on the outcome of an infringement lawsuit.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to claiming likelihood of confusion, a trademark owner may claim trademark ""dilution,"" asserting that it owns a famous mark and the use of your mark diminishes the strength or value of the trademark owner's mark by ""blurring"" the mark's distinctiveness or ""tarnishing"" the mark's image by connecting it to something distasteful or objectionable-even if there is no likelihood of confusion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.uspto.gov/page/about-trademark-infringement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.uspto.gov/page/about-trademark-infringement</a></p>

<p>I think it's clear that if you name your product ""Trademark something"" an infringement is very likely to be found. Imho there is no way a consumer will see that and <strong>not</strong> assume a common source between your product ad the trademark - and even if you somehow manage to proof that the consumers don't confuse your products and all see how they are not related, the dilution suit is going to follow. Dilution is simply adding to the information in the mind of the customer other information which the customer will connect with the trademark even though it's not yours. And If your toothpaste tastes bad - the customer will connect that with Sriracha and you are diluting.</p>

<li><p>Any other advice/tips?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: My product is an IT security solution. It uses AI technology to detect defacement on your website and automatically restores it to its original state, eliminating fallout and loss of reputation for the company. Think of it as insurance for your website.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>For a lot of tech founders, sales is the activity they would love someone to take off their hands. So when an opportunity like this comes up, it's tempting to dive right in. I'll hit your questions, but first, a few general points.</p>

<p>First, any sales person, good, bad or indifferent, will be <em>great</em> at pitching themselves. But beware. <strong>Unless you can sell, you're a poor judge of sales ability.</strong> Your benchmark isn't, ""Can this person sell better than me?"" but ""Can this person I've never met sell a product like mine with only the resources I already have?"" So ask for current and recent testimonials, and contact their referees. If they aren't delighting other startups today, it's unlikely they're a fit.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>the world didn't change because you received an email</strong>. Entrepreneurs are optimistic opportunists. We know the huge part serendipity plays in success. So we want to believe that what we just heard is evidence that the luck is running our way. Beware your instincts, and consider the odds. Which is more likely, that the first email you've had comes from a sales genius who's stumbled across and fallen in love with your startup, or that you're the hundredth email on a list titled, <em>startups who may have cash in the bank</em>?</p>

<p>Now to your specific questions.</p>

<p><em>How do I trust someone I can't watch?</em></p>

<p>Your problem isn't that <em>they're</em> overseas, it's that <em>you</em> can't oversee what you don't understand. So just like commercial founders need to learn some tech, tech founders need to learn some selling, at least if direct sales is part of the marketing mix.</p>

<p>You'll discover that <strong>selling isn't magic</strong>. It's a structured process with activities that can be defined and instrumented, and with results that can be measured. So if you want to build a sales partnership, build in that culture of transparency from day one, and get advice from an experienced sales manager.</p>

<p><em>How do I pay someone when I have no money?</em></p>

<p>Step one is to write an email that makes one thing crystal clear: you're only willing to discuss commission-only remuneration. The first response is likely to be all about the time they're going to invest. So you <strong>reply in a way that respects their professionalism, that reassures them that the compensation will be generous to reflect their commitment, and that reminds them that commission only is the only offer</strong>: are they interested on those terms? Without a ""yes,"" the conversation ends.</p>

<p>If the way you price involves a significant up-front fee, there's a good chance that you can keep a commission plan simple and risk-free. But if you're a SaaS and making your money mainly from monthly fees, there's a challenge.  The sales person wants to be rewarded for the expected value of the sale, but the cash is going to come in slowly.</p>

<p>You can do a lot of thinking and reading to solve this. I'll make one suggestion, but whether it's workable for you, I can't know.</p>

<p>So I would think about creating an offer that's not available through your website, that amounts to a substantial discount for annual (or at least six months) prepayment. That's a tool for them either to close a sale, or to lock in a customer who's getting value. And if your commission plan is all about collected revenue (so that you carry no cat risk), it's a tool for them to earn somewhat less, but much faster.</p>

<p><em>What agreements do I need to put in place?</em></p>

<p>Take qualified advice. Personally, I would require a one way NDA, a standard commercial agreement with an overall expiry date and a way for you to terminate without notice in the first (say) three months, a schedule laying out the product offerings included and the pricing subject to change, and a schedule laying out activity and outcome targets and commission plan, subject to change with (say) three months notice.</p>

<p>Your test today is, <strong>Would it be a no regrets deal for me to make the exact same agreement with five people in other countries?</strong> If that makes you uncomfortable, you need to get tougher.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my last point. In my view, <strong>offer no exclusivity</strong>. If that's something they want, set a review date with a sales target. If they smash the target, then on that date (and not before) you'll be willing to discuss exclusivity. <strong>Don't tie your hands unless and until you can trust not promises but payments.</strong></p>

<p><em>What else?</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>In your private life, <strong>when someone tries to sell you a product or service, your default is ""no.""</strong> And you very rarely invest more than loose change in a purchase you don't understand. The same is wise in business.</p></li>
<li><p>Selling is a structured series of activities. A lot of those activities don't need sales skills, and some call for different kinds of sales skills (""hunting"" and ""farming"" for instance). In a new and unfamiliar market, <strong>if you don't see the data, you may end up with nothing</strong>. A great sales person will be (fairly) happy to discuss the best way to progress each of those activities, because they'd love someone to do the routine work for them, freeing them up for the selling coal face. If they take offence or try and blind you with science, most likely they're someone who knows about the sales process but doesn't have the skills or the hunger you need.</p></li>
<li><p>If your home market isn't all you need right now, shouldn't you make it a priority to pick the best new market to attack? <strong>A distraction looks very, very similar to an opportunity.</strong> And an apparent opportunity becomes a distraction if it gets in the way of your strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>When you subscribe to a service, you can stay in control. But when you hire a person, you have to invest a lot of time. Bear in mind <strong>this could be the right person but the wrong time</strong>. If you're still seeking product/market fit, a great strategic hire may cost you time and focus you can't afford. Positioning the conversation as a future possibility rather than a current decision may be better for both of you.</p></li>

"How to reserve a trademark?","82","","<p>I'm developing an own commercial web project and I'm going to distribute it under a trademark. But currently it under construction and I have to reserve the trademark rights somehow until the project is done without forming a legal entity, is it even possible?</p>

<p>Is it enough to post webpage with specifying the trademark name <code>Trademark™</code> and <code>Comming soon</code> inscription? Will that help to specify the list of coming soon products with a description?</p>

<p>In this case, if somebody will register it as full-rights trademark <code>(R)</code> before me, would it be possible to challenge the registration?</p>
","<p>Just for a spot of background, registered trademarks are a bit tricky for this. As it sounds like you know, to own (and thus to register) a trademark, you must be using it actively in commerce. For a startup that's pre-launch, that's often not possible.</p>

<p>To accommodate that use-case, the USPTO has an ""intent-to-use"" application. As suggested by the name, this is a way to register your interest to register the trademark at a later time. There are a few things you have to do to keep your intent-to-use alive, but ultimately, the idea is that you're ""claiming"" the mark for six-month intervals (which you're paying for, of course). That stops anyone else from registering the mark themselves, which is good.</p>

<p>Once you've got it registered, it'll be much easier to challenge anyone else who tries to use the mark before you get up and running, because the date you filed the intent-to-use will count as the registration date for the trademark itself.</p>

<p>Ultimately, before you're using the mark in commerce, there's not a lot you can do to stop anyone else from using it, because you don't have the trademark (implicit or otherwise) yet. But if you want to stop others from registering before you, and you want to stop people who used it during this period once you do have it registered, an intent-to-use is a nice way of doing that.</p>

","<p>Mainly Scam. I would ignore this.</p>

<p>Investors are trying to maximize their profits. In general they do this by a good selection instead of a huge portfolio (too many different startups)</p>

<p>On the other side there are (too?) many events and opportunities to present your startup/company in front of investors. So in general investors do not have to do ""cold prospecting/cold calling"" or even mass mailings. </p>

<p>Lets assume I'm wrong with this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Investor&lt;>company relationships are based on trust, contracts, direct interaction and transparency. In the best case you become friends and partners. Because you increase the value of the company and the investor likes your idea and progress.</p>

<p>In this case a complete stranger found your company. And fell in love with your idea, progress and team. He will contact you again. On a better way, with better arguments. (In my opinion this could happen, but not with this email guy :-) )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Copyright Registration of Games</strong></p>
  
  <p>Copyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or
  the method or methods for playing it. Nor does copyright protect any
  idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in
  developing, merchandising, or playing a game. Once a game has been
  made public, nothing in the copyright law prevents others from
  developing another game based on similar principles. Copyright
  protects only the particular manner of an author’s expression in
  literary, artistic, or musical form.</p>
  
  <p>Material prepared in connection with a game may be subject to
  copyright if it contains a sufficient amount of literary or pictorial
  expression. For example, the text matter describing the rules of the
  game or the pictorial matter appearing on the gameboard or container
  may be registrable.</p>
  
  <p>If your game includes any written element, such as instructions or
  directions, the Copyright Office recommends that you apply to register
  it as a literary work. Doing so will allow you to register all
  copyrightable parts of the game, including any pictorial elements.
  When the copyrightable elements of the game consist predominantly of
  pictorial matter, you should apply to register it as a work of the
  visual arts.</p>
  
  <p>The deposit requirements for copyright registration will vary,
  depending on whether the work has been published at the time of
  registration. If the game is published, the proper deposit is one
  complete copy of the work. If, however, the game is published in a box
  larger than 12"" x 24"" x 6"" (or a total of 1,728 cubic inches) then
  identifying material must be submitted in lieu of the entire game.
  (See “identifying material” below.) If the game is published and
  contains fewer than three three-dimensional elements, then identifying
  material for those parts must be submitted in lieu of those parts. If
  the game is unpublished, either one copy of the game or identifying
  material should be deposited.</p>
  
  <p>Identifying material deposited to represent the game or its
  three-dimensional parts usually consists of photographs, photostats,
  slides, drawings, or other two-dimensional representations of the
  work. The identifying material should include as many pieces as
  necessary to show the entire copyrightable content of the work,
  including the copyright notice if it appears on the work. All pieces
  of identifying material other than transparencies must be no less than
  3"" x 3"" in size, and not more than 9"" x 12"", but preferably 8"" x 10"".
  At least one piece of identifying material must, on its front, back,
  or mount, indicate the title of the work and an exact measurement of
  one or more dimensions of the work.</p>

"Can engineering mentality be broken? If so how?","81","","<p>People say if you are going to start a startup kill the engineer inside of you. That is true you have to do that. We have managed to do that to some degree.</p>

<p>But can it be totally killed? Can an engineer truly become a man who thinks from the social perspective? Or will the engineer keep living inside the person?</p>

<p>If so how can it be killed and how much time will it take?</p>
","<p>There is a very good book on this particular subject called ""The E-Myth"" by Michael E. Gerber</p>

<p>However, he does not recommend to kill the engineer (or technician as he puts it) inside of you but recommends to find a balance between the 3 different aspects of entrepreneurship. The 3 aspect being...</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>The Entrepreneur's Role</li>
  <li>The Manager's Role</li>
  <li>The Technician's Role</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In the book, he asserts that most entrepreneurs are 70% technician, 20% manager and 10% entrepreneur. He then shows how this can be very detrimental, and then shows that it would be best to find a split of 33% technician, 33% manager and 33% entrepreneur. Instead of killing the technician (engineer) inside yourself he details ways to find a balance between the 3 roles. Obviously, there is too much information in that book to detail in this post.</p>

<p>As with anything in life, entrepreneurship tends to be about balance. There is no need to kill the engineer inside you, just make sure that the engineer does not overshadow the entrepreneur and manager inside you.</p>

<p>I've been building a website for the past few months that is basically a media sharing website, but it's tailored for a particular audience.  (As per most of these types of question, I'll be leaving the specifics out).</p>

<p>I'm looking at charging a very small amount (around £2 or $3 per month) for each member, primarily to cover the cost of the web server, and then hopefully further down the line it will cover my salary so I can take the project on full time and start to really make it grow.</p>

<p>The site is currently up and running, albeit still in the development phase, and I am about to release it to a group of beta testers in order to iron out any kinks, and identify any areas that need improving.</p>

<p>My real question is about the legalities of the whole thing.  I expect that an online subscription service has to be done ""by the book"", and I'm afraid I simply don't know where to start.</p>

<p>Any advice relating to this area will be very gratefully received, but any other pointers for a new starter would also be very helpful.</p>

<p>In Germany, (and as we both are in the EU there should be some similarities) you would have to do the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Set up Legal Notice (=> <a href=""http://www.jnj.com/others/legal-notice"" rel=""nofollow"">About the website</a>)</li>
<li>Get Terms and Conditions (=> <a href=""https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms"" rel=""nofollow"">About your service</a>)</li>
<li>Write a Privacy Statement (=> <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/"" rel=""nofollow"">Which data and what you going to do with it</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, that the complexity differs and is depended on your service. The payment should be part of your Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>You may let yourself be inspired by some other platforms with subscriptions. Please note, that even terms and conditions are intellectual property, so stealing could backfire to you.</p>

<p>Terms and Conditions normally consist of legal scope, conclusion of contract, rights and obligations of each contractor etc.</p>

<p>Subscriptions come with questions, like ""How much?"" (in €, $?), ""how often?"" (per month?), ""how long?"" (3-month subscription), ""automatically renewed?"" and ""methods and terms for termination?"".</p>

<p>If you google for ""Terms an conditions templates"" or similar you may find something interesting for you.</p>

<p>Also you don't have to provide all different payment solutions by yourself, you may search for a ""Payment service provider"", which does everything for you, but will ask for a percentage of your transactions. Have you ever asked your private bank consultant? May they have a solution for you or at least some information. It costs nothing to ask.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>a) are there examples of successful partnerships of this kind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not many, if any at all. At least not long term. Indirect sales are a great means to <em>expand</em> sales after bootstrapping them and figuring things out as you do. Particularly if your partners are providing value added services on top of what you're doing. But your company should be equipped to be the one that packages those partners in a deal with them as a value added service providers. And whatever you do, you <em>need</em> direct interactions with your clients to stay up to date on your client requirements - for that reason alone, you need a marketing and sales force no matter what you do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b) what are some of the best practices to make sure that such arrangements are successful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically: don't. Seriously. You want a direct relationship with your clients as much as can be. Particularly large ones. It's strategic. If you're a cog in a supply chain, your ""channel partners"" will eventually seek out alternatives and offer them to your prospects instead. That puts your business in a position where it's not in control of its own destiny, and you most assuredly don't want <em>that</em> to happen. The only workaround is to have a proper sales force.</p>

<p>To me, it appears that they leave themselves an ""out"" by saying ""Subject to the approval of the Board of Directors"". I'm accepting a lower base salary for options, so shouldn't the language be more concrete than this, such as ""Here are your 32k options. Sign below""?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subject to the approval of the Board of Directors, you may be eligible

<li><strong>Pre-exit options exercising:</strong> Will I get a cash payout worth my vested % if I leave and the company before the company exits?</li>
<li><strong>Early IPO/exit Accelerated Options Vesting:</strong> What typically happens if I'm in for a year, 25% vested, and the company exits. Do my options fully vest to 100% of .89% automatically?</li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Leaving the company: Do I need to exercise my options if I leave? Or can I leave them invested with the company if I think the company will continue to grow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to read your agreement.  </p>

<p>Normally in the US stock option grants usually expire 10 years after the grant date. So you need to exercise the options before this date or the grant expires.</p>

<p>Additionally (in the US) there are two types of stock options.</p>

<ul>
<li>NSO stock options: No additional limitations.</li>
<li>ISO stock options: These options normally expire 90 days after leaving.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have until the grant expires to decide whether you want exercise them. Note there are taxable implications on the timing of between when you exercise your options and when you sell your stock (consult the appropriate people about these taxes).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pre-exit options exercising: Will I get a cash payout worth my vested % if I leave and the company before the company exits?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Your options are only a right to buy shares at a specific price. If the grant expires so does your right to buy the shares at that price.</p>

<p>Even if you buy the shares you may not be able to sell the shares (i.e. get your money back). So your money is tied up until you find somebody (some company) willing to buy the shares from you.</p>

<p>Note: Until there is an IPO (or the company is bought) there is no marketplace to sell shares in the company. So it has to be a private sale and you can only get what somebody is willing to pay for them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early IPO/exit Accelerated Options Vesting: What typically happens if I'm in for a year, 25% vested, and the company exits. Do my options fully vest to 100% of .89% automatically?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read your agreement.<br>
Unlikely. Accelerated vesting is usually only provided to founders (or very important people).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I ask the CEO to include all these things in the clause, including more concrete language about the options ownership?</p>

"What tactics work well for startups using field sales?","81","","<p>In my experience, <a href=""http://market-by-numbers.com/customer-development/"" rel=""nofollow"">customer development</a> is a key aspect in rolling-out a startup. That said, it's unclear how to transition from doing customer development in the field to doing sales in the field. What would be the best way to do this and what are examples of companies that have done this well?</p>
","<p>The specific tactics depend on what you're selling to who exactly. The reason you'd want to use field sales is <em>because</em> the sales process is complex, e.g. you need to slip through the filter of an enterprise client's engineering department. That said, the usual suspects all apply at least to some extent: website, networking, white papers, email automations, advertisement, direct mail, you name it... You basically set the focus on providing as much of the right information as the prospect needs, through whichever channel the prospect prefers. (Taking decision makers out for dinner or on a golf course also helps.)</p>

<p>With respect to transition, the interesting question isn't so much how as it is when. After a certain time, you reach a tipping point where founders can reproduce the process of selling to the same type of prospect with a reliability and potential scalability that they're satisfied with. Then is the right time to look into how, which is to say hiring sales people to execute this well oiled process for you.</p>

<p>For examples of companies that have done this well, look into B2B related businesses that you never hear about unless you're within their industry. Typically, they'll be in the enterprise market or in capital intensive markets related to manufacturing or infrastructure: telecoms, mining, oil, construction, machinery, etc. (Juniper Networks comes to mind off the top of my head... If memory serves, they launched by selling core IP-network equipment to telcos.)</p>

<p>It isn't always true, but assuming all locations being equal and consistent from year to year, how can I attract repeat business from last year's customers?</p>

<p>I realize, of course, that it doesn't <em>really</em> matter who's buying from me, as long as enough are, but I think I have an opportunity here to really build my business to excel over others, if I could just change that mentality from ""I drove by and saw it"" to ""we've been coming here for years!"" That would mean all the business I get now, plus some more.</p>

"Should the Core Team Buy Hardware with Seed Money","80","","<p>Our company currently is self sustaining. We'll soon get an seed investment though.
Up until now everyone has been using their private hardware. Should I provide the core team with new hardware (macs, pcs, iPads etc.) as soon as the investment kicks in, or should we keep on going?</p>

<p>If a team member would ask I probably wouldn't hesitate to provide something in the range of his needs. But should I provide the stuff to everyone as soon as the seed money kicks in, or should I save the money for new employees?</p>
","<h3>Answer</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Save your money.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>Save the money for something you really need. Wait for the ""wheels to fall off"" on the hardware you currently have. Wait until the performance downgrades to the point that performance issues cost you more in lost productivity than the replacement cost of the hardware.</p>

<p>Seed capital is a scarce and limited resource. On a practical level, it will cost you dearly if you run out and need investors to ""re-up.""</p>

<p>This is a ""mindset"" you should adopt. Not just with this particular issue but with everything. If people get the impression you are ""loose with the purse strings,"" they will take advantage and ask for more than they need. On the other hand, if you get the reputation for being a ""tightwad"" (like you need to be) people won't even bother to ask unless it's absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The very definition of an incubator is an institution that helps young companies - definitely they are there to support you. There are several kinds of incubators, choose well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, I want to be king should be the target statement...rich is just an addon for that,..</p>

<p>You want to be king, so having greater control over your destiny is more important than getting a lot of money. </p>

<p>Most angel investors are chasing a very ambitious return on their investment. Often you must fulfill these expectations or shut down the business (even if it is profitable).</p>

<p>My advice is: take time to get the smartest mentors you could possibly find, as early as possible. Instead of founding your own company, you may consider joining that young startup filled with people smarter than you: you get experience and money that you can use to start your own business later.</p>

"Why did Netflix's DVD business not offer pay-per-rental service?","80","","<p>I'm doing some random thought experiments on the DVD rental industry (what there is left of it, now that Blockbuster and Walmart are long-gone), and I got to thinking: <strong>among the various dvd-by-mail rental services out there, why is their go-to model the monthly subscription?</strong>  </p>

<p>For example, Netflix's lowest plan was 2 DVDs per month at a price of $2.50 per disc ($4.99/mo).  Why not offer to rent discs individually for $2.50 per disc, and maybe offer bulk discounts to encourage loyalty and reduce costs? </p>

<p>Any thoughts on this?  Is this to reduce friction in continued payments? e.g. if someone is paying monthly they're less likely to stop paying in general.  Or maybe this model reduced incentive for theft?</p>

<p>Is it possible they were missing out on some customers who only wanted to rent a movie once every 3 months?  </p>

<p>Thanks for indulging my questions :)</p>
","<p>One added benefit of the growing interest in subscription based pricing models is that it <strong>creates a consistent and reliable cash flow mechanism</strong>. The ""on-off"" nature of subscriptions creates easily trackable usage, which will help in resource planning and financial analysis. By tracking the number of active subscriptions, you can more readily provide user consumption insights and forecasts. Oppositely, in a pay-per-use model the multiple variables that affect individual consumption patterns makes modeling much more difficult.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example 1: Subscription Model</strong>: Every month you pay $10.00 for access to 10 DVDs a month.</p>
  
  <p>Every month, the business owner knows that the number of active subscription and can multiply it by the price. (10 members = $100.00) This is regardless of whether the customer's consumption; whether the customer gets 1 DVD or 10 DVDs that month.</p>
  
  <p>Doing a segment analysis, the owner can see the metrics of actual usage per subscription, and create multiple subscription levels to encapsulate different user types, but still has a simplified metric to track, that has some level of consistent expect income (number of subscription multiplied by the price of the subscriptions).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example 2: Pay-Per-Use Model</strong>: When you want a DVD, you pay $2.00 each time.</p>
  
  <p>Every month, the business owner tracks the number of sales and multiples is by the price per sale. However, as usage fluctuates more chaotically, the insights and modeling will be more volatile.</p>
  
  <p>Doing segment analysis, the owner will need to aggregate each customer's usage and then would need to do an additional analysis to decide how to segment it based on the data sets. The metrics are initially more granular and have a higher degree of volatility.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Another added benefit to the subscription model is, <strong>capturing the unearned value</strong> in terms of users who do not maximize their subscription consumption; You pay to access 10 DVDs a month, but only use 5 DVDs. The subscription model pays out the same for the business owner, capturing the value for the 5 unused DVDs available to the customer. In the pay-per-use model, the business owner cannot acquire any more value than the specific customer usage allows.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would agree that a subscription model has a certain advantage for <strong>customer retention and loyalty</strong>. Customers are less likely to purchase similar services from multiple vendors given a subscription model. Therefore you have the added benefit of retaining customers and preventing market share bleeding to competition. In the pay-per-usage model, there is no sunk cost for the customer, so switching between providers is simple and does not require the steps to cancel a subscription and initiate a new subscription with the competitor.</p>

"Finding survey participants for an idea with little to no budget","79","","<p>I recently graduated college and finally decided to pursue an idea I've had for awhile. I created a survey in Google and have been using my friends and their friends as my pool of respondents. I'm looking for at least 100 responses, but so far, my contacts have only yielded about 30 responses. I've looked into some of the paid survey resources online, such as Google surveys and SurveyMonkey, but I really don't have a lot of money to pay people. </p>

<p>What can I do, with little to no budget, to find more participants for my survey? </p>
","<p>Two words: <strong>follow up</strong>. Your friends, and their friends, mean well, but they're busy. So an invitation, a friendly reminder, a progress update, a request for help - everything you can do to nudge without getting spammy will tip your responses up a little. 30 responses is a good start, and you can probably get near or past your 100 target. If people are positive but don't follow through, call them and fill their responses in for them.</p>

<p>However, it's possible that your survey itself is the problem. Have you made it too long? Is it confusing? Have you made it clear whether it's named or anonymous? Have you spelled out a ""no spam"" promise?</p>

<p>So first, go through your survey super carefully, and be critical. It might be worth breaking it up into a one page, 1-3 question form that is asking people whether they're willing to help, and then another that goes just to people who respond positively.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other ways to get surveys out there, further out into your social networks. So invest a little more time with the first target group, both to push the responses up and to refine the survey to reduce attrition between good intentions and completion. Then take the improved survey out via LinkedIn, Twitter and the rest. You'll get there.</p>

<p>No, you need to get your act together and reach out to customers. For all you know you might not even have a product market fit at this stage <em>because you haven't been talking to your end-users</em>. You've done this so rarely that you don't even know where to find them. Go out there and find them, see if your product could work, sell. Sales will follow if your product solves their problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I risk launch the app only using Targeting Blogs, reddit, foruns, SEO? I am thinking seriously about this option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pointless at your stage. Go to meetups and events to meet end users, cold email and cold call end-users, do door to door in office buildings, ask people in the street what they think for all you care, what have you. Point is: get. in. front. of. end-users. You. Not a form. Not a VA. Not a consultant. You. The only way you'll ever discover whether your product is useful or not is first hand, straight from the horse's mouth. So go out there and ask.</p>

<p>Once you have the product figured out, as in you've a proven and repeatable sales process, and tried and tested sales arguments that chime in a delightful way in your target audience's ears, <em>then</em> head to blogs, Reddit, forums, SEO, AdWords, Quora, etc. You <em>can</em> do it before, but you'll get the best bang for your buck/time if you learn what messages work first.</p>

"New users by invitations","79","","<p>I was always wondering what is the point of newly launched websites, services and startups, to accept new users only by invitations.</p>

<p>I have an example of <code>oneplus.net</code> smartphone. To take one, you need to be invited.</p>

<p>What is the business model behind it?</p>
","<p>Gmail is another BIG example (obviously not anymore, but a decade or so ago when they launched you needed an invite to get a MASSIVE 1GB email account!)</p>

<p>But why?  Well, there's a couple of primary reasons I'm aware of.</p>

<p>1) Broader testing before opening to the general public.  Hopefully you've already done some decent testing by the time you get to launching anyway, but its always hard to predict exactly what will happen when you open it up to a flood of new users from the general public.  The invite only system slows that flood down to a level where you can more easily manage fixing any problems that do inevitably crop up.</p>

<p>2) Exclusivity.  If leveraged correctly, the exclusivity of needing an invite to get into the system can be a powerful marketing and branding tool. The psychological effect can make those who have signed up more loyal as they feel like they're part of an exclusive club with the power to allow or deny new membership.  It gives them part ownership, which is a powerful thing (the psychology of ""ownership"" is a big part of the reason the Stack Exchange network works). And if leveraged correctly, the exclusivity can make those without invites want even more to part of the club.</p>

<p>3) Promotion. Along those same lines as point 2: If your users feel like they partly ""own"" the site and are responsible for it, and if they like your service, they will want to see it last, grow, and improve. So in a sense, they will feel like they have a responsibility to invite their friends, and specifically friends they think would like and use it.  Who better to help you find and connect with your target audience than those who have already proven that THEY are your target audience. Your customers are very likely to have friends with similar needs and interests.</p>

<p>4) Feedback.  This somewhat ties into the point about testing. Okay so you've developed a tool or service, and maybe you've done some focus groups to get feedback.  But again, what is going to happen when the general public gets a hold of it? Once again, here is a way to turn that flood of feedback into a slower stream.  And now you have a chance to respond to the feedback and make changes/pivot if you need to whereas if you'd fully opened the service to the public it would be harder to change.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are other reasons. In some sense you could make an endless list of the reasons different companies have had over the years of doing something like this. But those are some of the bigger reasons I'm aware of.</p>

"Should the head of a technology company knows more than others in that field?","79","","<p>I have seen two types of companies. Some companies have a manager that he is the inventor of first products of that company (like Gates, Zuckerberg, Ellison, Wozniak, Page &amp; Brin) and some others don't have this type of managers and their boss are more businessman. My question is: if someone wants to create a technology company(In electronics and computers I mean) how much knowledge of electronics/computers should he have? should he be an expert in that field? If not, which knowledges and abilities are needed to create a new successful technology company? (I mean something like smartphone, laptop, etc company).
Are there any successful companies in this field their founder/head didn't know technical things in that field?If yes, how he could create that company?</p>

<p>I ask this because of 2 main resons:</p>

<p>1.Why if someone knows more than me and has more ability(in engineering    I mean) must become my employee? Why he doesn't make his own company    and hire others?</p>

<p>2.Yesterday I wanted to order an Android/Ios application. I put my project in some freelancer sites. I got different suggestions with different costs and period times. So I searched more on google and found there are many ways to do an Android/ios project. And maybe only an expert of mobile applications can understand the underlaying codes and difference between them, and decide which one is better and what is the real value of that?</p>

<p>So, when I am not an expert in my field, how can I find the best solutions...specially when it's a new company with a very limited budget!</p>
","<p>If, as a founder or manager, you limit yourself to hiring people who are <em>less</em> talented than you are, you're limiting your chances of success. As a manager you merely need to know <em>enough</em> in a desired skill set to be able to evaluate the skill level of those you're hiring and whether they're performing or not.</p>

<p>A founder with no technical skills whatsoever will usually be merely guessing at the technical skill level of their future CTO. But consider for a moment that they could (indeed should) be evaluating their future CTO based not on their technical skills but rather on their ability to hire and manage a technical team and to deliver projects on time and on budget.</p>

<p>This above is a lesson I learned at one of my first jobs: I was engineer at a telco startup. Our CEO hired a CTO a few months in. My new boss had spent his entire career in ceramics and knew very little about telecoms. But it didn't matter the slightest. He knew enough to ask questions from time to time. He relied on the team's judgement for everything, and stuck to keeping things streamlined and well managed.</p>

  <p>1.Why if someone knows more than me and has more ability(in engineering I mean) must become my employee? Why he doesn't make his own company and hire others?</p>

"Structuring a partnership agreement for a gym startup","79","","<p>I am a 30 year old fitness trainer. I have worked in 5 gyms in the last ten years and I would consider myself a technically strong trainer. Offlate a very close friend of mine proposed that we should start a gym together and that he would fund the entire capital required. These were his terms -</p>

<ul>
<li>Let's say the capital amount is 10,000$ </li>
<li>He is receiving an unsecured loan with a high-interest rate of 20% per annum. </li>
<li>He expects us to start repaying the loan in 6 months, on a monthly basis. So say, 2000$ is the interest, it would be 167$ in interest plus say, 500$ of the principal. This payment would be counted as operating cost. </li>
<li>Other operating costs would involve paying other trainers, utility bills, taxes, and equipment maintenance. </li>
<li>He proposes 50% share in monthly profits after we take care of all the operating costs. So let's say the gym makes 2000$ this month, 1000$ is operating expenses, then I would make 500$. </li>
<li>He expects me to <strong>not</strong> include my salary as part of operating costs. </li>
</ul>

<p>I see many problems with this deal - </p>

<ul>
<li>My friend is a passive investor in this deal. He is only going to invest money.</li>
<li>As an investor, he is expecting the return on his investment too quick (6 months).</li>
<li>If the gym doesn't do well or barely makes even, then I do not make any money for the time I spent as a trainer/manager/marketing person. I have a family to feed.</li>
<li>My friend says I am a 50% partner in liability too. So, say the gym doesn't do well, we have to sell of the equipment and whatever loan amount remains,  I would have to split the repayment of it.</li>
<li>I would be the only owner taking the bottom line for function and growth of this gym. I have strong pubic relationship in my area and I am a trained professional. </li>
<li>I intend to build this gym as a brand - If the gym does very well and If I have to expand in two years, I can potentially secure a bank loan at lower interest rate, but I would have a 50% partner who essentially brings nothing to the table and has to be tagged along just because he invested 50% in the first gym and is a part owner of the brand. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I have no money of my own to invest in a brand new gym. I will not receive a bank loan because I have nothing to plead as collateral. So, an investor who believes in my skills, professionalism, honesty, and integrity is my only way to realizing my dream of building my own gym. </p>

<p>So, here are my questions (I am novice in business management and this is my first business deal) -</p>

<ul>
<li>How bad is the deal that my friend is structuring? </li>
<li>Is it not financially/legally incorrect to split profits whenever the gym makes a profit? Wouldn't it make more financial sense to re-invest the profits the gym makes back into the gym? Or invest it in other market-linked investments?</li>
<li>Typically, if an angel investor funds your company, do you give up so much equity? especially, when the investor is nothing bringing anything to the table other than money. </li>
<li>Isn't my friend short-sighted in his expectation of ROI? </li>
<li>Let's say a bank did fund my business, I would be a 100% owner and I wouldn't have to give up any equity. But when my friend funds the business, I have to pay his ROI plus he has access to the entire profit the gym is making and take out the money from the gym whenever he wants.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am thinking about structuring the deal this way: </p>

<ul>
<li>I will be taking a salary as part of operating costs, which will be reviewed every 6 months depending on gym growth. My friend will receive ROI starting in 6 months on a monthly basis.</li>
<li>The profit the gym makes will be reinvested in the gym / other investments.</li>
<li>My friend should be happy that for the funding he is doing today, he is going to make a 20% return starting in 6 months and has 50% stake in a future gym chain. </li>
<li>I plan to include a buy-sell agreement which would set conditions for him to sell out his equity to me, should he decide to move on after he receives full ROI on his money. </li>
</ul>

"When to bring patents in to the business plan?","79","","<p>I know that patents (at least certain types and under certain circumstances) have a 1-year grace period for filing them.</p>

<p>From a business perspective, is there benefit to having the patent filed ahead of time?</p>

<p>If it matters, it is a utility patent I would be considering. </p>

<p>Assume I'm fairly confident none of my competitors would have a similar system in place and publicized before the 1 year grace period for filing was over (which, as I understand it, would nullify my ability to file if they publicized a similar innovation before I filed).</p>

<p>The only benefit I see is that I would be able to say I was using a ""patent pending"" manufacturing process, but I don't think my customer base would care all that much (though I suppose some markets might count that as an asset). But I'm wondering if I'm missing something.</p>

<p><em>Note: I'm not questioning the value of a patent or whether it will be useful in my case. Just the merits, from a business perspective, of filing before publicizing -vs- publicizing and waiting until sometime during the grace period to file, especially in a situation where there is little fear of competitors developing a similar system during the grace period.</em></p>

<p>ETA: I'm in the U.S.</p>
","<p>In the United States, you're right. There is a one-year grace period between a public disclosure and getting a patent. The main issue lies that that grace period ends at the border. If you want to expand out into a PCT or have patents in a number of nations, you'll be out of luck. So if you're content with your market here, you <em>could</em> wait, but as a general rule, particularly given the choice, you should opt for the more broad option.</p>

<p>If you're tight on cash, you could always get a provisional application, which gives you the filing date for a significantly cheaper amount. It'll only last one year, but then you're in the same situation as you'd be by waiting for a non-provisional (what people generally think of when they think ""patents""). And for what it's worth, I know you say this probably doesn't matter, but a provisional also does give you <em>patent-pending</em> status.</p>

<p>Beyond that, it's important to remember that the USPTO currently works on a <em>first-to-file</em> basis. That means if someone else was to file for your patent, there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to dispute it. And on top of that, by default, applications are kept secret for eighteen months. So even if that did happen, you likely wouldn't learn about it for quite some time.</p>

<p>So personally, I would always suggest filing <em>something</em> (be it a provisional or a full-on non-provisional) before your public disclosure. But you can <em>probably</em> get away without doing it. I just don't see any realistic reason to want to.</p>

"Best way to onboard non-techies to saas software?","78","","<p>I find that 1/10 people are able to figure out how to successfully use the product and these are technical people.</p>

<p>The other 9/10 have some success or none at all. This is because they miss steps or do not do things properly as dictated by the manual.</p>

<p>I reach out to them and help them how to use the tool properly which half of that 90% appreciate.</p>

<p>The other 50% of that 90% just doesn't seem responsive even when I send them a personal email offering to train them and point out what they did wrong. They even leave once they spent very little amount of time. Are these people simply bad fit?</p>

<p>My #1 concern is people making a mistake on their end and thinking that it's the software's fault. Some people do ask if its something they did wrong which it usually is.</p>

<p>My current method is to monitor their usage and reach out if they had too many unsuccessful attempts.</p>

<p>I just want to know if there is a better way to onboard these non-technical people to my saas software which lets you extract data from video files. You need some input from the user in order to make the data what they expect. This is what large number of non technical users are having trouble with.</p>
","<p>I used to work for a software company that held itself up to an amazing discipline.  They took the blame for everything that went wrong in their software.  They didn't try to divide their customers into ""the smart ones who could operator their system"" and ""everyone else who couldn't"".  Instead, they embraced even the slightest hesitation from the most novice user with humility, abjectly apologizing for their software's failure.  ...and then fixing it.</p>

<p>The company motto was ""every support call leads to a change."".  If a customer was so confused by the interface, function or scope of the system, that they actually picked up a phone and called for help, then there was obviously something horrifically wrong with the software.  Something that needed to be changed before another customer suffered from its effects.</p>

<p>And that software was an enterprise level accounting system...   At first, the phones rang a lot.  Very slowly, across years, the phone calls decreased and eventually stopped.  </p>

<p>What did I learn from working for that company?  I learned that beautiful interfaces are inferior to obvious interfaces.  I learned that rarely used options, which confuse those users who don't use them, are a detraction from the quality of the software;  I learned that any function that can't be described in a paragraph, should probably be left out or at least hidden from the default user view.</p>

<p>Before my time with that company, I wrote complicated, comprehensive solutions which took time and intelligence to master.  My ego was supported by the length of the software's feature list, how much longer it was than those of the competition.</p>

<p>Now I take pride in embracing obviousness.  I figure out what is important to my customers and I do that for them in the simplest, most unchallenging way possible.  And I've gotten my customers into the act, thanking them profusely when they show me how to make what I've written clearer for them.</p>

<p>Your software ""extracts data from video files"" after the user indicates what kind of data they are looking for.  I don't really know what that means or how many options you are offering your users, but those options seem to be causing 90% of them trouble.  As strange as it sounds, requiring the user to know what they want to do, is putting an unfair burden on them.  </p>

<p>So stop asking them to know what they want.  Computer power is cheap!  Waste a little!</p>

<p>Consider running your data extractions exhaustively, creating result sets for every possible user input, prior to asking them what they want.  Once you have an exhaustive set of result sets, filter out the empty and invalid ones. Show the user what you have found and let them choose which result set fits their needs.  </p>

<p>A/B test it, but I'd bet that the users will have an easier time choosing from available results, over picking from available options.</p>

If so what kind of restrictions are there? What risk would there be (to me/to my personal credit score. i.e. if I opened up an account that only reports to commercial credit bureaus)?

","<p>Opening a checking account with a debit card is drastically different than applying for a credit card. </p>

<p>Business credit is only loosely tied (short story is it can only hurt your score) to an individual's credit score, and most likely if you're a minor, depending on your financial status and the business status, it may be difficult to be approved for a credit line. </p>

<p>Banks don't ""feel"" - they automate every credit decision, with occasional manual oversight in serious situations.</p>

<p>While I'm not a legal professional, it's my understanding that in order for a minor to get a credit card <em>or</em> a checking account via any bank in the United States, the bank would require written permission &amp; joint signing by a parent or legal guardian.</p>

<p>Thus, given you applied for a card with your guardian, and were approved, if you missed a payment it would hurt both your credit score and that of the guardian's.</p>

"Hiring with not much money","78","","<p>I have what I think is a pretty good idea (we all say that) that I want to implement

<p>It means that it appears you're assuming that design is a factor in the success of you're idea -- and currently, based on the information present, I see no reason to believe that's the case.

I am currently financing the venture, while my partner is using his connections to have access to lots of expensive machinery for fabrication of said robot. My first thought was to become financially organized by incorporating as a Delaware C-corp, because we hope to secure investors at some point, and hope to be high growth, etc. This way we could open a company bank account and track things through that. However, the legal complexity keeps deterring me from doing so because I don't know how much I can go back and change once we have the entity formed. I want to avoid legal expenses, since we don't have a prototype/MVP yet and there is a fair bit of development that will happen before we have anything tangible.</p>

","<p>Talk shares and investments through beforehand. It doesn't matter what solution you chose, but you should agree on what your expenses and his expenses are worth talking shares.

<p>Given that you are a startup and this will be your first release, it sounds that you do not have customers/users yet.</p>

<p>Under this premise, for your first users you do not need a content delivery network with servers around the world. When you click on a small website, you can not even tell on which continent the server is located. And you probably will not have a hundred clicks per minute on day one.</p>

<p>Paul Graham wrote in his article <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Do Things that Don't Scale</a></p>

  <p>When you only have a small number of users, you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan to automate later. This lets you launch faster, and when you do finally automate yourself out of the loop, you'll know exactly what to build because you'll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if Amazon S3 is too costly/time-consuming at the beginning, you have the possibility to host everything on your own servers. And this is <em>because</em> you are still small. Move your data/service to some CDN later, when you have too much traffic to handle it on your own server.</p>

<p>By delaying payment, it sounds like you're risking your business directly.</p>

<p>The super simple answer (more easily said than done) if you're comfortable with the process and expense to get it going, is to look for investors. But I didn't figure that was the answer you were looking for.</p>

<hr>

<p>On Windows Azure, Microsoft charges ""preview rates,"" which I think are generally around 50% of the general availability equivalents. The percentage isn't all that important, but as long as you make clear to customers that they're getting a discount in exchange for helping test the software, I think that's a good model.</p>

<p>The trouble there comes up if you don't have a lot of new customers coming on board. If you depend on just a few loyal customers, it's difficult to start charging them for something they've been getting for free.</p>

<p>If you do have a lot of new customers, however, I'd be tempted to introduce that pricing model.</p>

<p>What I would do, in either case, is work toward some milestone (we're receiving positive feedback on more than <em>x%</em> of jobs). Once you're there, optionally change your version name (e.g. ""alpha"" becomes ""beta,"" or whatever), then announce a new, discounted pricing model. They can't expect it to be free forever, and if they do, they probably aren't valuable customers to you anyway. I don't think you have to worry about how you announce it, beyond how you should always phrase public announcements well.</p>

<p>Ideally, just from a keep-people-happy perspective, announce it to take place in a month or two, so people have time to prepare. If the possible surge of people getting in free jobs while they can will hurt you, of course, you might get away with doing it immediately, depending on what your contract says.</p>

<p>For example, if he provides $10k, and your business plan says you can get to point X on Day Y, Is the return on that $10k worth more <em>to the company -- speaking <strong>revenue</strong> here --</em> than whatever it is you are contributing?</p>

<p>For example, if he's providing half a million dollars to hire three full time employees for 6 months paying competitive wages, and you're simply a fourth employee, it's hard to justify getting more than 20-25% on your end. But if he's putting up $10k-$50k to just get a couple contractors, while you work your sweat equity in over a year for a low wage, you should be reaching for 70-80%, if not more. It really does depend on the business. In the end, you want to reverse engineer your return on equity.</p>

See for instance ReplyApp or Hubspot's recent offering related to doing outbound. Both have excellent blogs, too.</p>

<p>Lastly, keep in mind that there always are two hierarchies in a business. There's the formal one with the person who signs towards the top. But they've precious little time. You'll need excellent copy to actually get them on the phone, else you'll get a ""not sure if this is worth my time"" reaction and end up speaking with a proxy. There also is an informal one, with the people that have the ear of those who sign on top. They're the ones actually making the calls in practice, so get their advocacy early. They're <em>super</em> important in your sales process when dealing with larger businesses.</p>

<p>The two don't necessarily read their emails at the same time. The high-in-demand execs often plow through their emails on Sunday evenings to start their Monday with a reasonably clean inbox. The less-in-demand ones are easier to reach on Friday afternoons after they're done wrapping their week. (Local time in both cases, of course.)</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that actually cold calling <em>is</em> an option. Especially on a Friday afternoon when your target is wrapping up their week. A few emails ahead of time helps a lot of course, because your name will be familiar. If you can get past the assistant - which not <em>that</em> hard if you put forward how you can provide genuine value - you'll dive straight in there like it's butter.</p>

<p>Either way keep your message short, to the point, and customer centric. There's no shortage of pathetic emails and sales pitches out there. Don't talk about what you do, and avoid being vague and general/encompassing at all costs. Provide value, and talk about how customers like your prospect are getting benefits out of your service in concrete, specific, and no uncertain terms.</p>

"Taking investments from friends and family","77","","<p>When starting up a company, some friends and family may express interest in investing. If the company doesn't need money at that point, but it certainly could help, is it wise to take money from personal acquaintances who also are not accredited investors? Or is there a better way to get them involved? What are the risks in doing so? </p>
","<p>If you can survive- however uncomfortably- without funding, then don't take any funding. </p>

<p>The risks with taking funding is the scrutiny you'll have to live with while you're in your development phase. Yes, even your family members will want to know what you're doing every day or week; when they're not experienced in start-up development, it can cause headaches, as they might not understand the processes and burdens associated with the development phase. Their emotions might go up and down based on meaningless events in your start-up, and your situation could result in added pressure and drama that will just hinder your start-up's growth.</p>

<p>There's another issue: what if your start-up fails? It would be much harder to manage that guilt than, say, if you couldn't pay back your grant given to you by some rich private equity firm. Even if you don't feel guilty that the idea you passionately pursued didn't work out as you expected (which, hey, happens more often than not) it does make an awkward situation to see your family's net worth slightly down, given that you didn't really need that money in the first place.</p>

<p>Finally, consider this: taking money from multiple family members might complicate matters if you ever decide to get bigger funding from angel investers. They'd want to know who has an ownership stake, and if terms need to change, then you'll have to get the OK from all your investors, unless you made  them sign a waiver form of some sort beforehand. This could get messy, and the angel investors might think twice in funding a certain project if they suspect ownership structure could be a massive financial and legal issue down the road. </p>

<p>If you'd really like to get them involved, wait until you will actually need money for expansion. At that point, you have a pretty good idea that your business is going to take off, and any investment in the business will more likely than not produce a positive rate of return. Ownership will be better defined, and you could use the help of angel investors to decide how to appriopriate ownership accordingly. </p>

"Welfare, unemployment, government assistance as funding for startup?","77","","<p>I've always been interested in startup stories and I've read about several stories how founders were on various forms of government provided social-welfare before they made it big. </p>

<p>These stories usually come in the form of:
""My family and I were on welfare, so I worked very hard day and night to build [insert product here] and I became a millionaire/billionaire.""</p>

<p>Once you look more carefully you will notice that they usually had the opportunity to get a middle-class job and provide for their family, instead they chose to chase their dream at the expense of the tax-payer.</p>

<p>I'm starting to see a pattern of people using government provided welfare as a form of startup seed founding in the sense that they can provide the basic necessities for their family while they work on building their future.</p>

<p>Some examples of the aforementioned  is the ""<a href=""http://fundersandfounders.com/too-poor-to-succeed-jan-koum-whatsapp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WhatsApp</a>"" founders (<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/whatsapp-jan-koum-lived-on-food-stamps-2014-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WhatsApp Co-Founder Jan Koum Once Lived On Food Stamps</a>) and <a href=""http://www.thesquander.com/casey-neistats-net-worth/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Casey Neistat</a>, both of which used government benefits to survive while building their products/service/skills. I've read about many others and even saw a documentary about a beverage company that did the same thing.</p>

<p>Personally, I've seen two success stories in the form of a family relative who essentially (used...possibly abused) welfare until he made it big in his IT company. Also a now rich friend who lived in the projects and collected welfare while building his baking company.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p><strong>Is using government welfare/unemployment knowing that you can get a new job, but refuse to do so by stating ""the job wasn't a good fit"" legal? Clearly, you are not forced to take the first job offer while on unemployment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you become successful, do you have to pay back that welfare money?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is this morally correct?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I have the opportunity to provide my family the basics by living at my parents home while collecting welfare, unemployment, food-stamps, medicade, and so on. Should I do this as a way of starting my software company? I have a good amount of money stashed away, but why would I use that when I can use these benefits first.</strong></p>
","<p>ok. 
I'll give this a go.</p>

<p>my problem with the question is it has no definitive answer and is broadly opinion based depending on where you sit within the political spectrum. It also is worded in such a way to suggest a negative opinion of welfare.</p>

<p>My views on welfare are that it is broadly analogous with limited liability for corporations. They both provide protection from negative outcomes. Limited companies allow entrepreneurs and business owners to take risks and push boundaries without ending up in debtors prisons.</p>

<p>Similarly welfare allows people to take risks with job prospects and opportunities without starving, especially in the current job market where job security is rare. It allows people to become artists or take jobs that don't necessarily have stability like joining a startup. Knowing that if it folds for whatever reason the state will catch them when they fall (as they catch large corporations when they collapse).</p>

<p>In countries which have low job stability and low welfare you see unprecedented incidences of young people flooding into medical degrees looking for job security (See South Korea after 1997 financial crisis - the least popular of the 27 universities medical degrees became more difficult to get on than the best engineering degree at the best university - unofficial data)</p>

<p>So from my point of view welfare creates a diverse workforce which benefits everyone.</p>

<p>So, in my view it is not necessarily morally wrong to initially use welfare to test out an idea or employment opportunity if you have a plan (i.e. business plan) which will lead to off welfare as welfare is a safety net not a home. Especially if it will lead to employing others, as then the welfare you have received will remove others from welfare also saving more money than you received multiple times.</p>

<p>""If you become successful, do you have to pay back that welfare money?""</p>

<p>I think that everyone has an moral duty to pay taxes back into the system, which is how you repay it.</p>

<p>""If I have the opportunity to provide my family the basics by living at my parents home while collecting welfare, unemployment, food-stamps, medicade, and so on. Should I do this as a way of starting my software company? I have a good amount of money stashed away, but why would I use that when I can use these benefits first.""</p>

<p>See above. I see nothing wrong with accepting state aid for a time when you have a plan to get off it, corproations and capitalists appear to have no quarms in accepting tax deductions or subsidies when they have cash in the bank. Much better to look after the people who can't easily look after themselves rather than those with the money already who can.</p>

"What are requirements to open LLC in USA?","77","","<p>I'm a solo software developer and I'm going to run a commercial web project. It's requirement is checking account to perform payment transactions. As far I know, the minimal way to get it is opening of limited company. I would like to open it in USA. Of course, I clearly understand that there're nuances depend on a state.</p>

<p>So, I'm interested about next things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I be the only employer of an own LLC company?</li>
<li>How much would it cost including registration and yearly taxes?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions are related to USA legislation and it's any state :)</p>
","<p>Yes, you can be the sole member of your LLC. As a matter of fact, that may be the most common case.</p>

<p>In almost all states the website for the Secretary of State will list the cost and requirements for establishing an LLC. The cost is very different depending on the state. I have seen everything from $50 to $500 per year and that is only based on a few states.</p>

<p>I would note that an LLC is not generally required for opening a business banking account. You can also get a DBA ""Doing Business As"" account. To register your business this way, you would need to visit your city/county courthouse (in most states). This can reduce the paperwork and often the cost dramatically. Actually, I am not sure that you even have to register in some states. (If anyone wants to chime in here, I may need to update this part.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the advantage of an LLC is the legal protection of keeping your business and personal finances a little more separated. An LLC can be helpful in many cases, but don't just assume it is required. Maybe the bank or payment gateway you want to work with requires and LLC (that seems odd, but maybe). If not, make sure you are ready for LLC before you do it.</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you talk to SCORE (<a href=""https://www.score.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.score.org/</a>) about whether an LLC is right in your specific case. They offer free help with the questions you are looking at right now. Or, you can open a few more questions here with specific details, and we can explore more.</p>

"What math or stat models exist that can successfully predict growth potential of a startup?","77","","<p>I know almost nothing about startups and never know how to judge whether my ideas actually merit a serious attempt at a startup.  </p>

<p>I have made several efforts in the past to educate myself about how startups work. However, few resources I have consulted have offered (to me) a convincing method for how to measure/gauge/estimate the growth potential of a startup business. Let me illustrate what I mean through an example.  </p>

<p>Suppose I invent an unusual and desirable way of making pizza. Let's say I have managed to invent a pill that, when water is added, immediately morphs into a fully formed, deep dish, Chicago-style pizza (complete with toppings and already in a box lol). How do I judge whether this product is marketable? Let's suppose I take my pizza pill and sell it around my neighborhood or my city. I thus get a small sample size of what potential my pizza pill has for that cluster of customers. Suppose I also have extracted data on them because I have them use some sort of app or online interface that permits me to monitor certain buying behaviors. But of what value is that data? Can I take data about a local region or small cluster of people and immediately extrapolate to make claims about the growth potential of my business to a much larger sample size? </p>

<p>Perhaps my background as a mathematician and physicist makes me take mathematical claims slightly more literally than others. When I make a claim about what a number represents, I want testable ways of demonstrating that the number means what I say it does. If I am measuring temperature, I don't want to estimate my refrigerator is 50°F and have it be 100°F. My milk, eggs, yogurt, meat --- all of it will spoil. In other words, that means all my resources go to waste. Similarly, if I make an estimate of the number of customers I expect to buy my product, I want to know (within a margin of error) that estimate will actually be accurate. I want to know there is a very high probability (<strong>not a high hope</strong>) that the resources I invest in my venture are going to yield profitable returns. On the flip side, I want to be able to identify when an opportunity <em>won't</em> be profitable so I can save my assets for ones that will be. </p>

<p>To my knowledge, no such method exists. Perhaps it is too idealistic. If that's true, what are the alternatives? Having failed to find info on this myself, I have turned to SE in the hopes someone has ideas about how startups and entrepreneurs approach this problem. </p>
","<p>Pre-orders are the only valid predictor in my experience.</p>

<p>Statistical data obtained using models offer <em>zero</em> predictive value. We're discussing humans here, with desires, moods, etc.; they're not predictable automatons.</p>

<p>Another way of doing the same study is: ask friends and their buddies if they'd buy whatever you're thinking about -- and they all promise to buy it.</p>

<p>It also yields zero predictive value. Because friends and their buddies will say they'll buy it as a favor to you. Some might even actually buy it. Real clients won't.</p>

<p>Here's yet another: ask a sample of your target audience if they'd buy it -- and they all promise to buy it.</p>

<p>That -- yes -- <em>also</em> yields zero predictive value. (I've seen this first-hand, and it was <em>not</em> pretty.) Because, the only one who commits to anything when a promise is made is the person who <em>receives</em> it.</p>

<p>Here's one that works: <strong>ask a sample of your target audience if they'd buy it <em>right now</em>, and collect their <em>signed</em> commitment to do so</strong> -- to be delivered later.</p>

"""Date Founded"" for a Product Revival","76","","<p>I have a product that I'm bringing back to life. My father wrote it as a side project back in the days of VB 6.0 (it was a simpler time) and it only really had one client, but that client stayed on for around ten years. We thought a couple times about updating it over that time, but ultimately the ROI just didn't support taking up either of our time.</p>

<p>We're looking now to resurrect that project and make it a bit more modern and profitable, and I'm curious of whether it's reasonable to say we were founded in 1996, or if it's safer to just go with, well, a week or two ago.</p>

<p>I'm not so much concerned with the legality of it all, we have a pretty good claim to the trademark, and we've had a one-page website for it for as long as I can remember, basically just saying ""this site is under construction"" with no intent to update it. But I am wondering about the ethics and practicality.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the main concerns would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>People's expectations, particularly during a beta, where it might not look or act like software that's been alive for nearly twenty years.</li>
<li>Potential users doing some research and learning that while, yes, it was founded back then, that's not exactly evidence of any sort of experience.</li>
<li>Just in general, it could be viewed as misleading, since the project wasn't really taken all that seriously in the past.</li>
<li>Less significantly, if people will take it less seriously because they associate it with being old.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are certain advantages too, marketing being number one. Particularly having a viable date <em>before 2000</em> seems like it could be a very good tool.</p>

<p>Am I forgetting anything? Are there pros or cons of picking either the new or old date? Or are there standards off of which I should be making this decision? And I know I said I'm not overly concerned with legality, but as a bonus, have there been any precedent-setting cases wherein a company was (or was not) found to be using false advertising through similar means?</p>

<p>Maybe it doesn't even matter, and founding date is simply a legacy term that people don't really care about in tech any more?</p>

<p>I do think it's noteworthy to mention, as I've implied, that we're keeping the same name, and obviously it's the same kind of program, with the same goals in mind.</p>
","<p>I would go with the 1996 date. And with the story about your dad. Build on that story. How did he get the idea? How did you get involved? What's been going since then?

"How can I tactfully ask long-term clients to stop expecting freebies from me?","76","","<p>I recently took over ownership of a small restaurant from my parents on their retirement. It's the classic ""they've had it forever"" kind of business and I grew up around it, but business has been stagnant for quite some time now. We're doing okay and I have no complaints, but like any young entrepreneur, I want to see us do <em>fantastically</em>.</p>

<p>I see lots of options opening up to build the business through social networking and event hosting, and I've already begun to do that, but we still have a couple (very welcome!) long-time guests and friends of the family that I'd hate to see go. However, mostly at the hand of my parents, they've developed a system of getting freebies, like drinks and sometimes even food. What started off as a friendly gesture from my father to them (they're friends, which complicates things) has become more of a regular occurrence than I'm really comfortable with.</p>

<p>To be clear, my concerns stretch beyond finances, which I think makes it a bit more difficult. They know that we're doing, well, <em>okay</em>, so it's not as if they're really taking precious pennies from us, but if nothing else I'm worried about the principle. As we enter a new phase of our business, I don't really want to carry the indefinite tradition of giving free food or beverages out to friends.</p>

<p>In general, they're pretty good about it. They certainly hold no malice in taking the food, but every once in a while I have to take a step back and think about that I'm essentially paying meal bills for these people, even if it isn't super commonplace.</p>

<p>How can I begin or conduct a conversation with them that effectively and kindly conveys ""you need to start paying now"" without offending them? Part of my hesitation, I should reiterate, is that they're really <em>my father's friends.</em> They are mine in that I've grown up around them, but I have a hard time viewing them as equals with me. I love having them around, they're definitely fun to talk to, but at the end of the day, they're thirty years my senior and honestly I'm a bit intimidated.</p>

<p>Is this just one of those things that I have to rip the Band-Aid off for? I've thought about approaching my father and having him speak with them, but I'm not sure that would be any less awkward for either of us (I think he probably doesn't see the same problems with offering them the products as I do). Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation, or any tips for going into either of those conversations?</p>
","<p>Tricky one... Imho, approach this from the point of view of whether these patrons are a net positive or not.</p>

<p>The most important consideration you should have in mind is that a restaurant business is like a hotel: <strong>you cannot roll over stock</strong>. A table that stays empty cannot be sold later; it is lost for good. As such, any patron that covers your costs is potentially good to take.</p>

<p>The other important consideration is that <strong>an empty restaurant isn't inviting</strong> to patrons who might not know you. It can mean the locals are avoiding the place because they know the food or service aren't great. (This is obviously less true in the age of Yelp, but I'd gather it still counts.)</p>

<p>As such, they bring potential value even with freebies. Do the math... Is what they're paying covering the cost of serving them (meal, staff, etc.) over the course of a month?</p>

<p>If not, or if you think they're not currently worth your time, politely ensure that they do: ""Sorry, the best I can do is free drinks."" They'll understand. And come on, it won't hurt you to give them a free drink if they're regularly eating at your restaurant.</p>

<p>If yes, cool... this is extra income which you wouldn't have gotten had they not been there. Also keep in mind that they bring intangible value, since a full restaurant is more inviting than an empty one.</p>

<p>Once you're <em>regularly</em> turning down higher value patrons because of them, and you feel that risking their regular business may be worth doing, consider a compromise: ""Can I suggest coming outside of rush hours next time?"" ... which gets them back to bringing intangible value.</p>

<li>My website has a potential to grow overnight. As per my current knowledge I have build that site in ASP.NET MVC with SQL SERVER. I am planning to host that on Amazon server.</li>

<li>The type that tries to grow your lead generation and automate your sales process.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a disclaimer, I'm admittedly biased since I advocate the second type to my customers.</p>

<p>Still, I sincerely believe that most startups and small businesses need that second type of CMO -- the first type is primarily of interest to larger corporations.</p>

<p>The freebies you are interested in are actually of the info-product type. Chiefly:</p>

<ul>
<li>A free eBook (and paid-for eBooks to boot)</li>
<li>A free piece of software or widget</li>
<li>A free course by email</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal each time is to capture an email and feed it drip email that actually converts.</p>

<p>Ideally, you <em>sell</em> info-products using this channel too. Put customers in a situation where they're doing repeat business with you, because it's easier to sell your $X,XXX service after selling an $XX eBook.</p>

<p>In the event it needs to be stated, you want to deliver this type of thing to <em>qualified</em> leads -- which is to say leads that actually <em>need</em> and <em>can afford</em> what you have to offer.</p>

"Expansion strategy based on current external business partners model","75","","<p><strong>Bit of context</strong></p>

<p>My company is a small startup company, owned 100% by me. Culture is important, I want to make complex software that matters. Focus is building 'big data' products, that is: high performance database systems and search engines (that is: the combination of the two) and some 'stuff' to make that work in a project such as web crawlers and text processing engines. Most time is spent (80%+) building the actual products and doing serious R&amp;D on the main product (data analysis) which is basically a super-fast database/search engine built from scratch. Customers are mostly government, medical, etc, that want to analyze data and run into trouble with more traditional BI/DB systems.</p>

<p><strong>USP</strong></p>

<p>The big data product makes it possible to analyze lots of data based on very simple formula's, which are then executed within a few seconds. The benefit from this approach is that domain experts can create queries without having any understanding of 'difficult' things like SQL and BI, thereby reducing data intelligence projects from months to mere minutes. Also, there are plenty of domain experts out there, and not so many big data experts, which means it's easy to find the necessary people for the task at hand.</p>

<p><strong>Ext business partners</strong></p>

<p>At some point in the first year of the company I decided against hiring sales personnel in the short term. Back then, this was a difficult choice; I couldn't find a suitable business partner, didn't have a lot of money and (most of all!) needed the time to build the product. However, you need money to survive, so I decided to use my network to find external business partners instead.</p>

<p>Time is still a major issue; there's just so much work.</p>

<p>Because of the above context, I've been looking at (smaller) consultancy firms as external business partners. They can do the sales by selling strategy, trainings and the expertise to provide a business solution. My company provides the product (+support) to do the data crunching to support that and a (small) project to get everything up and running. </p>

<p>The main benefit from this approach is that a <em>lot</em> of time is saved.</p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>First off, don't get me wrong: the company is doing fine, I just feel like I've hit a ceiling and want to figure out what the best way forward is. I also have some good ext. business partners that mix just fine. It just doesn't feel like that's enough.</p>

<p>However, I did notice some problems. The one most important is this: Each company has its own focus; external business partners are no different. Most consultancy firms that I've met don't want to sell products; they want to listen to the customer, and then provide him with the product that matches <em>exactly</em> what the customer tells them. </p>

<p>This is a problem for me, because (1) I want them to push my product, not some arbitrary product out there; (2) they value big suppliers over small suppliers because that's what most customers believe is 'right'; (3) if I let a customer and the consultant decide what product they want, it could shift my company's focus in a way I don't want it to shift.</p>

<p>To motivate them to sell my product, I've tried things with kick-back fee's etc, so far without any luck. I also make sure my company has the (product) contract and do the last piece of the sales process to ensure we can deliver.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>My question is: what would be the best expansion strategy from here? </p>

<p>F.ex. possible options are: (1) Motivate external business partners in another way? (2) Use a different type/industry of external business partners? (3) Put more effort in hiring a good sales guy? (4) Put all focus on the product, focus on marketing it on a global scale once it's done by hiring someone? (5) Something else?</p>

  <p>The big data product makes it possible to analyze lots of data based on very simple formula's, which are then executed within a few seconds.

<p>If I may be candid, what you're doing exactly is still unclear to me. But the above did a much better job at explaining why it might be interesting than your website and your email. ;-)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) I want them to push my product, not some arbitrary product out there; (2) they value big suppliers over small suppliers because that's what most customers believe is 'right';</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They're both occurring because your partners are catering to large corporations, institutions, and administrations. Selling a high-priced, custom tailored deal with consulting fees to such clients is very different from selling a €250/month SaaS product like you did at your previous startup. In the latter case, a buyer could often pull out a credit card because it was within their discretionary spending limits. In the former, your partners go through a grueling purchase process. Each stage involves people who demand their pound of flesh. That can mean requiring a big supplier.</p>

<p>Put another way, you're in near-conquered territory by the time your partners call you in. That makes them very valuable even if they don't always push your product.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) if I let a customer and the consultant decide what product they want, it could shift my company's focus in a way I don't want it to shift.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They won't if you're firm and say no when they request features you're not interested in or when you need to spend too much time integrating your solution into their systems. Not all clients are a good fit; it's crucial to say no at times.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To motivate them to sell my product, I've tried things with kick-back fee's etc, so far without any luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be wary of not falling into the trap of paying them too much and not enough at the same time. Two related questions:</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Motivate external business partners in another way? (2) Use a different type/industry of external business partners?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An approach you may not have tried yet is to make your marketing docs less generic. Have you spotted a few very specific use-cases that were a) reasonably common and b) not too time consuming when it comes to integration work? If so, put forward that your product solves <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>Doing this will send the message to other types of clients that you're probably not a good fit.</p>

<p>It may also be that you have no proper marketing and sales process in place. That's the weakest link in most startups and small businesses I meet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) Put more effort in hiring a good sales guy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See my opening remark on what makes the partners valuable. Your salesperson will need a month or more to close each deal. You want someone to look into indirect sales channels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) Put all focus on the product, focus on marketing it on a global scale once it's done by hiring someone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by this you mean ""ship v.1 and then start selling"", you run a strong risk of creating a product that serves no true business need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(5) Something else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Per the above:</p>

<ol>
<li>Focus your marketing so it caters more to your best types of clients and less to your time-consuming ones.</li>
<li>Refine your marketing to make your partners' job and your job easier.</li>
<li>Manage your existing partners (make sure they constantly have you in the back of their head) and find new ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>Short term:</p>

<li>Hiring independent sales reps.</li>
<li>Sales consultancies, sales outsourcing.</li>

<ul>
<li>My target audience are small to medium startups, in need of mobile application development.</li>
<li>An in-house sales team might not be feasible considering our location, but I might be wrong about this.</li>
<li>We're bootstrapping so We don't have unlimited resources.</li>

<li>I need to drive sales in short term to be able to fund the long term plans.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What's the best way to drive more clients? Are there any companies or professional individuals who could help me?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: My target audience is located in the US.</p>
","<p>You have short and long term mixed up. At your stage what you need is word of mouth.</p>

<p>Firstly, local clients are an option for you - Mexicans are mostly broke, but there also are a lot of rich ones. (I lived there.) Create a meetup.com account, check out the local chamber of commerce and what have you, and then go to every local event where you think you might find prospects. Do talks here and there. You'll be surprised by the results. Expand to other conferences and meetups when you figure it out and get results in.</p>

<p>Secondly, work on your website. It takes over a minute to load on a 2014 MacBook Air. That's intolerably bad. And the white light type against the agave background is unreadable. It's all working against you. It sucks. Off the bat you've zero credibility if you're positioning yourselves as designers. Sorry to be blunt here, but you need to hear it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, get a <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/q/5757/1824"">unique selling proposition</a> and hammer it across your marketing and your website.</p>

<p>Fourthly, ideally build some kind of e-course on your site to get your prospects into your funnel. Offer an info-product of some kind as a reward, and collect emails using your preferred mailing list's phone app when going to meetups (Mailchimp, GetResponse, aWeber, etc. all have one). Then throw 6-8 emails to those addresses using an auto-responder to demonstrate your expertise. Don't be salesy. Stay informative. Until the last one, of course. It works wonders.</p>

<p>Lastly, work on word of mouth proper. Involve your clients in your marketing. You want them to champion you at all stages of your sales process: tell their success stories on your site, show their testimonials, ask them for referrals (try to include this in your contract on a best-effort basis), invite them to webinars and meetups, and so forth. Nothing sells better than a happy client, because prospects like them hear how great you are straight from the horse's mouth -- a horse they can identify with.</p>

","<p>If I understand your idea correctly it sounds like what you are asking would require you to form an agreement with the copyright holders of all these articles. Different newspapers deal with copyright differently.</p>

<p>Downloading lots of articles without permission is not a good idea. Take a look at the story of Aaron Swartz if you want to know more.</p>

<p>Sometimes, copyright is allocated to the organization the work is published in. E.g. a city newspaper might claim copyright over the material written by a staff author.</p>

<p>Some newspapers only hold a non-exclusive non-transferable right to publish content. This means that authors are allowing the organization to publish content but not authorize others to republish it. For this situation you would have to ask the authors if you could republish the material.</p>

","<p>Unless you're selling hand-coded HTML websites (which you should not) a way to proceed is to not give your client any admin access to the server until you have been paid.</p>

<p>Then, try to work out a schedule (you have a contract, <em>right</em>?) that goes something like 50% upfront (this should cover your costs) and then either 50% upon receiving the deliverable. Or for that matter, 100% upfront for smaller projects once you've enough experience and references that you can command higher rates. That way you reduce your risk - you cover your costs even in the odd cases where you don't get paid.</p>

<p>There's also something to say about avoiding crappy clients. Don't even try to do business with anyone who has ""I'm going to be a source of problems"" written all over their face.

"How to structure - Art Brokerage?","74","","<p>I am in Colorado, USA.  I have a few friends who produce art of a common variety, but do not want to try to sell it on their own.  They have asked me to form a company and handle marketing/sales/legal/taxes so they can make their art and profit without worrying about those aspects.  This will start with sale of pieces made by one artist to local businesses, and expand to conventions, and internet sales.  </p>

<p>Capital is at a minimum, so I cannot afford to simply purchase the art, I will need to represent the artists, and sell for a commission.  I want to keep my friends concerns of paperwork overhead in mind, what would be the best way for me to carry forward, in regards to corporate formation, and how the artists are treated (as partners, shareholders, employees, ...?).  I have looked into many guides describing the differences between LLC, SP, LLP, S-Corp, and C-Corp, as well as read some standard contracts for brokerage, but still feel very much lost.</p>

<p>Thanks for all help.</p>
","<p>One way that I have seem something like this happen before in a brick and mortar store, but is not exclusive to this sort of setup, it a consignment contract. Essentially the artists agree to give you 30%-50% of the sale and you agree to sell the product for them. In this way they have a business agreement with you as independent parties. </p>

<p>They specify a price and a percentage and you both sign the document that lays out what you agree upon. This way, you don't have to worry about them having any sort of license and they don't have to go through the paperwork of being members or employees. I have no idea about the legal nature of this in other states like Colorado, but I've seen this happen in Washington State. </p>

<p>As for you, maybe think about getting an LLC account and having the artists sign agreements between themselves and the company. This might mitigate some personal liability and it comes with some good perks like opening a business account specifically for the business transactions. It also gives you some more legitimacy while you sell.</p>

<p>But, don't let them force you into this unless its what you want to do. At the very least set a reasonable percentage for yourself because art isn't as easy to sell as you might think. There will definitely be some start-up costs for you from all the work of selling the art to web-hosting and other challenges.</p>

<p>Here are a few resources for the consignment contracts:

<p>One thing to keep in mind about these is that you might want to have a lawyer peek at them to make sure they hold up in your country/state.</p>

"When should you choose a name for your startup?","74","","<p>I'm helping a startup who is planning on building a subscription web application as a service.

<p>I already know how to choose a name, but are there any guidelines for <em>when</em> (along the startup life cycle) to choose one? What is the latest point at which a name should be chosen, and what are the pitfalls of choosing a name too soon or too late?</p>

"Advice on starting an international online teaching business in France","73","","<p>Interested hearing from you regarding a few questions about a company we are starting.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I am 22 and have been living in France for about three years, I am currently registered as an auto entrepreneur and have a French bank account etc.</p>

<p><strong>About the company</strong></p>

<p>We provide an online language learning platform specifically for people in Europe to learn to speak and write English through online courses with other native English speaking teachers.</p>

<p>The company is 100% online and we simply connect the teachers with the students while charging a percentage of each lesson for administrating the lessons, course-ware and payments.</p>

<p>The teachers come from all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>Q1 -</p>

<p>We are starting small but expect to exceed the annual revenue limit for Auto-entreprenures (€32,600). Due to our low profit margins we have to move to an EURL registration so that we are taxed on our profits instead of total revenue (which would kill our business).</p>

<p>Has anyone had any experience with the different business structures in France (EURL, SARL etc...)?</p>

<p>I'm specifically interested to know what the hidden costs are and whether I can navigate the registration process my self without paying accounting and legal experts as our business is bootstrapped with very little (read ""no"") expendable capital.</p>

<p>Q2-</p>

<p>This quote from an article entitled ""The pitfalls of France's auto-entrepreneur status"" got me concerned... it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although some employers, especially English teaching academies will
  push you to be an auto-entrepreneur, you should be wary, lawyer Jean
  Taquet tells The Local.</p>
  
  <p>“The government knows a lot of language schools employ teachers on an
  auto-entrepreneur basis when really they should be putting them on
  their payroll. These teachers can suddenly get caught in the crossfire
  when authorities decide to audit a school,” Taquet says.</p>
  
  <p>“The government is using auto-entrepreneurs (AEs) as bait to go after
  the companies,” he adds.</p>
  
  <p>Andy Denison, who runs an advice website for Anglophones on all things
  administrative adds: “We have known of a couple of companies who were
  only employing AEs when really they should have had salaried people on
  their books and these businesses have been caught out.”</p>
  
  <p>Under the rules of being an auto-entrepreneur you should have more
  than one client paying you for your services, because if you don’t
  then really you should be on a contract and the auditors will be
  looking out for this.</p>
  
  <p>“If you are constantly working for someone or especially if you sign
  some kind of exclusivity agreement with them, then that will be an
  issue with authorities,” Denison warns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We make it very clear in our Terms of Service that we are not employing teachers, we are simply providing a platform for the teachers to manage and interact with their students as well as a service to manage their payments.</p>

<p>So my question is how exactly will this work, we are not employers, we are service providers and the last thing we need is to be heavily fined and taxed on our already low profit margins.</p>

<hr>

<p>Interested in hearing from anyone who has walked a similar path, what were the pitfalls, what should we be looking out for? Any resources or articles would also be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,</p>

<p>Jethro.</p>
","<p>Regarding your first question, and if memory serves, the only practical difference between running an EURL and an SARL are a) the minimum capital and b) the number of shareholders (only one vs two or more: the EU in EURL stands for Entreprise Unipersonelle).</p>

<p>Worry about setting either up when you can no longer qualify as a auto-entrepreneur. The latter status is convenient, in that there's a ton less paperwork. By then you'll likely be able to afford an accountant who will walk you through setting up the company, take care of your accounting, and - in my view most importantly - answer whatever questions the fiscal authorities may end up throwing at you when they probe into them. (Aside: do not, under any circumstance, try to set up shop abroad if you don't have a cofounder living in the foreign country you're registered in.)</p>

<p>Regarding your second question: yes, it's a potential issue. If anything, Uber is in a similar boat. They're a taxi company with employees that is masquerading as an app with contractors. The legal environment will eventually catch up with them and that's a potentially massive liability. Depending on your setup you may end up being considered a school (which might need to be registered) with employees, rather than an app with contractors. In this respect the article you quoted nails the key issue to be wary about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you are constantly working for someone or especially if you sign some kind of exclusivity agreement with them, then that will be an issue with authorities”</p>

"Is Finance Factoring A Good Idea For A Startup","73","","<p><a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/520/how-should-a-small-web-development-startup-handle-an-online-only-customer-that-s"">This question</a> made think about the idea of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_(finance)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">factoring</a>.</p>

<p>My question is if, in general, the cash flow benefit of using a factoring service, such as <a href=""https://fundbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fundbox</a>, is worth the fees paid to the service? For startups in particular? </p>
","<p>Factoring services (and kissing cousins such as confidential invoice discounting, where your customer isn't part of the loop) are all about <strong>funding day-to-day business operations where the cash flow isn't in your favour</strong>. Let's think of an example.</p>

<p>Suppose you're setting up a website that lets companies offer their employees neck massages at their desks, booked via your site. You've found plenty of willing masseurs, and signed up some corporate customers. You're making 50% gross margin and the business is growing strongly. So what's the problem?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that good masseurs have to be paid within a month, while even your friendliest customers have a habit of sitting on invoices for 90 days before they pay you. When NewCo signed up, in month 1 they ordered $500 worth of massages, in month 2 it was $2,500, month 3 was $5,000 and it's looking like doubling again this month. Happy days!</p>

<p>Here's how the cash flow goes.</p>

<p>Month 1 - you invoiced $500 and received $0; you were billed $250 and paid out $0. Net = $0</p>

<p>Month 2 - invoiced $2,500, received $0; billed $1,250, paid out $250. Net = -$250.</p>

<p>Month 3 - invoiced $5,000, received $0; billed $2,500, paid out $1,250. Net = -$1,250.</p>

<p>Next month - you expect to invoice $10,000 and receive $500; you expect to be billed $5,000 and pay out $2,500. Net = -$2,000. To date, you've paid out $3,500 net.</p>

<p><strong>You're profitable, but cash flow is killing you.</strong> So you sign across to someone else the full value of the invoices you're sending out, and they give you (say) 80% of that value.</p>

<p>Doing that dropped your profit margin from 50% to 30%, which is painful. But it also transformed your cashflow.</p>

<p>Month 1 - invoice $500, collect $400; billed $250, paid $0. Net = +$400.</p>

<p>Month 2 - invoice $2,500, collect $2,000; billed $1,250, paid $250. Net = +$1,750.</p>

<p>Month 3 - invoice $5,000, collect $4,000; billed $2,500, paid $1,250. Net = +$2,750.</p>

<p>Month 4 - invoice $10,000, collect $8,000; billed $5,000, paid $2,500. Net = +$5,500.</p>

<p>In a startup, <strong>cash is almost always scarce,</strong> and it's quite often the case that if you need money in a hurry, you'll give up equity. It's <em>really</em> painful to find that you're smashing your targets, and losing a share in the business. And even worse to smash your targets and go bust.</p>

<p>So <strong>factoring and similar services can help you focus on growing the business as fast as you can.</strong></p>

<p>However, <strong>most startups should read this situation as a sign that they need to improve their business model</strong>. In my imaginary case, I'd be looking hard for ways to make my customers happy to pay earlier, both by the obvious tack of negotiating with their finance team, but also by seeing if I could incorporate something so valuable (pre-emptive health reporting that could save the company money in the long run?) into the service that they would accept better (for me) payment terms. Don't get comfortable with inherently bad cash flow!</p>

<p>But these services are valuable, and are too often overlooked. You just need to be aware of the three key costs/risks.</p>

<p>First, <strong>they're typically expensive,</strong> compared to ordinary bank loans. In the exploration phase of a startup, you should be more worried about effectiveness than efficiency, but that doesn't mean you should feel comfortable about handing over a large slice of the value you create every month.</p>

<p>Second, in traditional factoring (where you are essentially selling the invoice to a third party), <strong>there's a reputation issue</strong> - as your customers can see that someone other than you is collecting the money.</p>

<p>Third, <strong>it's very to get into trouble if business dips.</strong> In our scenario above, suppose we hit the holiday season and month 5 saw us invoicing $2,500. We'll collect $2,000, but still have to pay out $5,000 to masseurs for services delivered last month. So there's a lot of discipline required, because your business bank balance tells you an over-optimistic story.</p>

<p>Factoring gets badmouthed, but there are whole industries where it's the norm. Startups need to understand the tools available to them, and use whatever works best. Only <strong>make sure you're sufficiently financially literate to steer clear of the traps</strong>.</p>

","<p>You'll want all three in practice. You can outsource this work to any marketing agency or graphic design shop worth its salt. Even to a professional copywriter - they'll invariably know a few designers.</p>

<p><em>But</em>... one thing they can't do for you, or rarely well enough anyway, is figuring out what should go in the copy. It's one thing to write salesy tripe, it's another to become intimate enough with <em>your</em> client needs that you're able to write copy that sells.</p>

<p>Do they need to have it legally?</p>

<p>If not, then why do they do it? <strong>Is there any research or argument about whether it helps the sales and/or helps in giving a better signal about the product to the user?</strong></p>

<p>More saliently, if you do <em>not</em> disclose your affiliations, your credibility stands to drop to zero if/when they're discovered and turn out to be reason for concern. Angry users tend to generate a lot more noise and word of mouth than happy ones. So better play it safe and disclose.</p>

<p>You can do a few thought experiments if you need any convincing of the damage that lack of proper disclosure can do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given two pieces of research arguing different sides of a coin (e.g. smoking is good/bad), you learn that a lobbyist commissioned the piece in their favor while trying to make it masquerade as independent research. Do you still give that piece as much (if any) credibility?</li>
<li>On a newspaper website, you're a few paragraphs into an article and realize you're reading through salesy tripe that is masquerading as information. If the publication did not disclose upfront that the piece was sponsored and who the author is, will you still trust it to provide you with anything but more of the same?</li>
<li>Consider a list on just about any topic. You learn that its author receives a commission on each item, and that there's no affiliate program for items they're explicitly <em>not</em> recommending. The list's author disclosed none of this on their site; will you still trust it?</li>
</ol>

<p>For research, honestly no idea off the top of my head. Intuitively, there is, and you'll likely find it concluding that lying (i.e. no disclosure) works better until you get caught (and you will). Like any form of manipulation, subtle without being pushy works. In this case, so does being <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie"" rel=""nofollow"">an outrageous troll</a>. Once you get caught red handed, your credibility quickly drops to zero. And in today's world there always will be someone with a grudge who will actively call you out online.</p>

"How should I generate funds for prototyping?","72","","<p>How do I generate funds for turning my idea into an actual working prototype?
I am a 16 year old teenager, if can't get funds from my family or friends what should I do?</p>
","<p>If your invention isn't too complicated, you can make a low-quality prototype yourself. I've built plenty of prototypes out of cardboard, tape, plastic pudding cups, and other odds and ends. The benefit of a low-quality prototype is that you can get a feel for how it will look and work, but not spend much money (or no money at all!).</p>

<p>When you're gathering the pieces to create your prototype, rather than thinking about what objects are usually used for (like ""a cup is for holding liquids that you drink""), try to think about the <em>shape</em> of the object, or other properties such as whether it is transparent or opaque, rigid or flexible, smooth or rough, etc.</p>

<p>For example, I needed a clear plastic container that was circular and had a flat bottom, as one element of an invention. I went through my local supermarket and found containers like that I could have bought ... but I continued until I found pudding that came sealed in plastic cups that actually cost much less than the plastic containers I'd seen earlier! I was happy to eat the pudding, and then wash the cup and use it as part of my prototype.</p>

<p>I'd also had an invention in mind for storing my toothbrush in a drawer, instead of out in the open in the bathroom. In the drawer, I didn't want the toothbrush bristles to come into contact with anything, so I just needed to raise them and let them ""hang"" in the air. To accomplish this, I simply got a business card, made 2 folds in it, cut a notch in it at one spot, and voila - I had my invention! It even had a flat part to catch drips of water from the toothbrush head. And I still use that folded business card invention today.</p>

","<p>My suggestion is that instead of targeting corporate web sites for the moment, concentrate your efforts on small individually-owned sites, which are much less likely to have backup systems in place and would therefore be more likely to find your product useful.  Most corporate sites have failover and backup systems in place to do what it sounds like your product does, and what they have is integrated into their sites. 
Do you have friends who run/own their own sites and could potentially try this out for you?  This is where a ""friends and family"" network comes into play.  Ask around and see, because even if they don't need what your product does, they may know someone else who does.<br>
You could even try calling the technology news desks of local television stations and newspapers around the area.  Who knows, maybe it's a slow news day for them and they need filler, so your story could be useful.  It's a long shot, but worth trying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ability to select among revenue streams has broadened and
  complicated a decision previously restricted to pricing. First, for
  many firms, the choice between revenue models involves trade-offs that
  arise because increasing revenue from one source (e.g. subscription)
  most often reduces revenue from an alternative source (e.g.
  advertising or the sale of user information)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong> How does one revenue stream compete with each other?</p>
","<p>Let's consider the examples described in the text you cite: <strong><em>subscription</em></strong> vs. <strong><em>advertising</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Some sites, apps, etc. first offer you a free version (to encourage you to try it) in order to maximize downloads. But the free version contains ads which somewhat degrade your user experience. This is the <strong>advertising</strong> model at work.</p>

<p>Then, while you are using the free version, they will offer you a <strong><em>no ads</em></strong> version that requires you to pay a fee. This is the <strong>subscription</strong> model at work.</p>

<p>If you purchase the subscription, you are paying the app maker to turn off the ads. And whatever other features they might or might not add to your experience.</p>

<p>That's how the two models compete with each other. Turn on the subscription to turn off the ads.</p>

","<p><strong>In Virginia</strong>, the <a href=""http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-stock-corporation-act/"" rel=""nofollow"">Virginia Stock Corporation Act states</a>:</p>

  A. Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by § 13.1-657, <strong>a corporation shall hold a meeting of shareholders annually at a time stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws</strong>, except that a corporation registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is not required to hold an annual meeting in any year in which the election of directors is not required to be held under the Investment Company Act of 1940 unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation require an annual meeting to be held.</p>

<p>If a meeting is not held, Virginia provides that a court <strong>may</strong> order an annual meeting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>§ 13.1-656. Court-ordered meeting.
  A. The circuit court of the city or county where a corporation's principal office is located or, if none in the Commonwealth, where its registered office is located, may, after notice to the corporation, order a meeting of shareholders to be held:</p>

<hr>

<p>While the statute does not provide a definitive answer to your question, it does provide that the corporate bylaws should dictate the rules for annual meetings, including the shifted time-frames you describe. If you bylaws are silent on the issue, you might consider amending them to specifically allow flexibility in meeting scheduling.</p>

<p>If no meeting is held and a single shareholder demands a meeting 15 months after the last meeting, the courts may force a meeting. Practically speaking, you should not have trouble with scheduling your meetings in non-12 month periods as long as all the shareholders are okay with the decision.</p>

"How to decide if I should start producing my idea?","71","","<p>I've been thinking about this matter for months now. I have an idea of producing something similar to a mood lamp. I've made a prototype and I think people would love to have it.</p>

<p>But I don't know how to start producing it. At first I decided to make a few of them, say 20-100 of them, to assess the market and see if people like to buy it or not. But it needs some custom plastic parts which requires plastic injection molding (which unfortunately costs too much).</p>

<p>Packing is also another issue I have to order at least 1000 packing cases so that the price is reasonable.
So if I want to produce up to 100 of them it will cost too much and as a result the final product will be unaffordable.</p>

<p>I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. It is too risky for me with limited budget to take the risk of going for 1000 of them. What should I do? What other successful entrepreneurs with similar ideas have done? </p>
","<p>First of all see if you can sell the one you have.</p>

<p>It is pointless investing money into these lamps if no one wants even that one.</p>

<p>If it sells and you have made a profit then consider making more or getting orders. Kick starter and other online crowdfunding places are ideally set up for product creation and funding as you get as many pre-orders as you can and if it hits your funding target you get the money then are able to make the product afterwards.</p>

<p>You have to then make sure that your costs are correctly negotiated and your marketing is right (neither of which are small jobs in themselves)</p>

<p>If no one will buy the first one, for an amount that makes a profit then I would recommend stopping - finding out that a product or idea doesn't work is a valid outcome and allows you to assess why (bad marketing, wrong product) and saves you a lot of money and wasted time. You can then move onto the next idea.</p>

<p>Again, selling one may be a fluke. If your gathering of orders does not work or you don't hit targets for orders that would make you profitable then again it may not be the right idea or the right way to market them. Again you can assess if you forge ahead, test a new marketing message or move onto another idea</p>

"Most important hiring decisions for a start up","71","","<p>I am a sole founder of a mobile/web app Fintech business. I intend to outsource the design and development of the software in the initial phase. I expect that the outsourced tech company will provide additional support in the first 3 months after launching the product.  For me, this removes the need to immediately hire a CTO, but instead focus on gaining traction in the early phase and then proceed to hire one or two developers.  The question i don't have an answer to is this:  If my product was to launch tomorrow, what are the core hires i need to function properly and gain some traction assuming that the tech support is being initially outsourced?</p>
","<p>I don't think you can answer this question without a product.  For instance, assuming that your app is perfect (and has few features, which is not a bad thing), and that tech support is handled, you can probably do it all yourself until you get way too many users.  Some questions to ask: how many users do I expect to have?  How do I intend to market my app?  How will I administer sales/ad revenue?  Is what I'm doing legal, and how can I make sure it stays that way?  What infrastructure do I need to get this done?   How will I support my users (ie: customer support and tech support).  </p>

<p>If the answers to questions like these are all well known and you have a plan for how to do them, you're set and won't need anyone for a little while.  Once the job becomes way too much to handle (well, preferably before that if you're pro-active enough), hire someone to ""do the things you procrastinate on"".  </p>

<p>On the other hand, if you are looking at this list and have no idea on some of them, or you think it would be way too much to work to do it all, hire enough people so that the amount of work you are capable of/competent in doing gets done.  If you have no money for a lot of hires, I'd recommend learning how to do as many of those jobs as you can before finally finding the ones you can't do on your own, and focus your hiring there.</p>

"Should I build multiple Facebook Pages for a geographically diverse platform?","71","","<p>I'm moving and expanding my business from Colorado to Texas, and I've never been concerned with this before.

<p>We're moving to Austin, TX - a new market. I was asked if we should make a new Facebook page just as a sub-division to our market there.

","<p>For a company like yours, where location is important, I think it's a good strategy. I'd imagine users would be more engaged with a page that is relevant to them.</p>

<p>Seeing that it's common practice for companies to do this, I wouldn't worry about breaking any rules, although as blunders suggested it wouldn't hurt to ask.</p>

<p>I'd also suggest making a separate Colorado page if you go down this path. Since you have a lot of likes already on the main page, it wouldn't hurt to promote some location specific events on the main page, but I'd try to slowly wean off them as you expand.</p>

Evidence from 70 Field Experiments</strong></p>

<p>In this, there is a piece of text which reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the context of email marketing, computing incremental sales via a
  simple comparison of outcomes across those receiving and not receiving
  the email with an offer (in order to measure the effect of the email) is rendered
  inappropriate due to the selection inherent in targeting.</p>
  
  <p>Well-designed experiments can, in theory, overcome this problem. In
  practice, however, these experiments need to be executed with care
  because they can be non-representative, costly, and time-consuming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what does <strong>selection inherent in targeting</strong> mean? And why does it make the computations of incremental sales difficult/inappropriate?</p>

<p>And, why does the authors say these experiments are non-representative? Aren't email targeting campaigns intended to target specific group of customers?</p>
","<p>The selection bias is that the people who receive the email advertisement were targeted for a specific reason. Therefore the group will have skewed statistical results because the targeting would limit you to a small subdivision of the wider general population. </p>

<p>The results are effected by what ever selection criteria was used to target the emails. The likely finds would be that the data is biased towards an inflated success rate, versus the sales in the general public. This is further exacerbated if you are comparing it the second group, ""those who did not receive the email"", which also has a selection bias because it cannot include the part of the population that is likely to purchase the product, because that population comprises the group of people who did get the email.</p>

<p>Additionally, the reference to the results being ""non-representative"" is referring to the results and whether they demonstrate the effectiveness of the email campaign.</p>

How can i do it?","70","","<p>Me and my brother have an idea of the brand new product that would solve one widespread problem among the smartphone users. But due to the fact that we don’t have required resources and opportunities to make that idea come to life, I’ve contacted the company that might be interested in my idea and would be able to realize that project. I described them the problem and explained how my product would be able to solve it and have provided its advantages over devices that perform the same function. The COO of the company has replied me and wants to discuss that idea together and ensured me that it would be under NDA. Since I don’t have any prototype of my device but only the pictures of its appearance and full explanation of the mechanism, what can I ask in exchange of my idea to them? I don’t have experience in such things. As a graduate I want to offer them my idea in exchange for a chance for me and my brother to work for their company and some percentage from the sales in case they decide to produce it.

I can’t afford attorney to help me with my occasion, but I hope that I will be able to get advice from you guys.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
","<p>Yes, I think in a way you can ""sell"" your idea in exchange for a position at the company and I have seen variants of this approach done several times.  This is a form of what is generally called Intrapreneurship (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_entrepreneur"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_entrepreneur</a>.</p>

<p>If its your specialty then this should be a relatively senior position.  In terms of profit sharing this is possible, however there may be other ways you can get additional compensation such as management by objective, bonus,  commission on sales, overrides are a few examples.  Do not get too stuck on what the compensation is called as this varies in what is allowed, just make sure you understand how and when you get paid when it succeeds.</p>

<p>There are some changes in approach I suggest based on experience that you should consider before you meet with the COO.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Firstly an NDA is needed, however what you must also have is a non-compete agreement so when you disclose your solution they cannot just do it on their own without you and your brother.  If you search online you can get NDAs and non-compete agreements at a service such as LegalZoom.com or alternately you can get a freelance attorney on sites such as freelancer.com or guru.com.  I strongly suggest you get at least basic professional input and that does not have to be very expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Organize yourself, your brother and the idea so that you have a polished team presentation that is very clear in its value proposition to the company that includes financial impact, market detail and benefits for the company and the COO themselves.  Examples would be quantifying the market value, size and potential revenue in solid verifiable terms, market research even number of google searches for the solution.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally you need to be clear what is expected from you and your brother in exchange.  A job can be mopping the floor, so you need to be specific including salary and employment level, term and negotiate what occurs should you be terminated for any reason within a given period.  Becoming a VP of the division is pointless if you are fired in 3 weeks because they don't need you anymore to complete the project.  Be ready to negotiate this in detail when you give your presentation. This must be done in a written signed contract from the company.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Provide an ""out"" or a plan B should the COO be interested in the idea, but not interested in you being an employee.  There are times and conditions such as a hiring freeze that cannot be disregarded, even by a COO. However there may be no issue whatsoever engaging you as a contracted consultant.  </li>
</ol>

<p>I have also seen cases where the company does not want or need the individuals and instead makes a cash offer.  Recently a peer trying to gain a position with a top app company brought them an idea and they declined to hire him and instead paid him $100,000 for rights and release of the idea.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>I suggest you take the solution as far along as you possibly can before you see the COO.  The closer you are to the solution the more valuable and lower risk your proposition will appear to the company. Screenshots, prototypes, written code all would help in establishing viability and value.</p></li>
<li><p>Have other options or alternatives besides this company.  Research the competitors to your targeted employer, get the names of their COOs so that in your presentation you can say that you could take it to the COO at XYZ inc but wanted to give them the first chance at the solution.  This is not a threat you are just making it clear that you have other options.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally as added insurance and a huge increase in negotiating leverage and value is i suggest you file for patent-pending on the solution.( <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/patent-basics/types-patent-applications/provisional-application-patent"">http://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/patent-basics/types-patent-applications/provisional-application-patent</a> )  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is not that expensive, you can write it yourself and just pay the filing fee and it is sealed, filed for up to one year and the USPO does not review these whatsoever, so you will not be rejected.  Do this even if you do not have the intent or means to file a full patent during the year.  </p>

<p>When you present to the COO you can say that you have a patent-pending solution you want to give him in exchange for your participation.  This is a very powerful approach and also discourages potential idea theft on the company's part.</p>

<p>It's possible to register and operate such a company, but you're asking for trouble if your business has no compelling reason for being there.</p>

If you cannot provide the requisite compelling reasons, you'll end up with a full-blow, cavity-search like tax audit. And you <em>will</em> end up in trouble.</p>

"Starting a sole proprietorship: Freelancer Issues","69","","<p>I was wondering that if I want to start a start-up with sole proprietorship but hiring freelancers on the go for miscellaneous tasks (since no one is jack-of-all-trades) what legal issues I may run into? </p>

<p>An important concern is that for example </p>

<ul>
<li>I hire a freelancer who helps me with the business plan which makes it a success or </li>
<li>say a web developer who made my website or </li>
<li>an android developer who made an app for me </li>
</ul>

<p>and the idea worked and I started earning a fair income and profits, can a freelancer claim his rights on my profits? </p>

<p>Is it better to ask each freelancer sign an NDA before letting him start a work? Do NDA's hold only when a business organisation has been established or can they also be between two people: One the idea giver and another the idea maker?</p>
","<p>In part I agree with Michael and in part I disagree. #1 I don't think you are quite ready to start your business. You have an idea, but you have no idea where you are going with it. Write a business plan. At this point it does not have to be formalized or be in great detail. But you need one. The are many places that provide ""good"" FREE advice. Get some to get your business plan started. #2 Yes you need a NDA, but more importantly you need a contract with anyone who you want to help you. And get the contract signed BEFORE any work is done. The NDA can and should be part of the contract. Do not do the FINAL document yourself, unless you are lawyer. If there is a problem, you need your contract to hold up in court. However, to get started, pull off some sample contracts and NDAs from the net. Revise them how you think they should be. Then take your DRAFT to one of the FREE lawyer advisers. They won't opine on the agreement, but they could make it better, so when you do take it to a lawyer, you will save fees. #3 Until you have some risk, stay a sole proprietor. There is no need to to form an entity until you have risk (ie potential liability). Again, back to the FREE advice, ask an accountant (not a bookkeeper) when you might have risk. Then evaluate the risk. If you have nothing to loose, wait till you do. You don't need any entity yet. An entity costs money to form and to maintain. Your money is better spent.(Also I think there are better choices for startup entities.) #4 Your freelancer claim YOUR profits? Unless you make an agreement either written or oral to do so, probably not. Your greater risk is that if your contract is not properly written, the freelancer can steal your idea and maybe get away with it. #5 Michael is correct regarding filing tax forms. Again, go to the FREE advice to learn about it. There is some good (and some bad) information about your tax filing responsibilities on the net. Get somewhat familiar with it and then go get the advice. And yes I have done this before, many times.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup company (startup or start-up) is an entrepreneurial venture
  which is typically a newly emerged, fast-growing business that aims to
  meet a marketplace need by developing or offering an innovative
  product, process or service. A startup is usually a company such as a
  small business, a partnership or an organization designed to rapidly
  develop scalable business model.[1] Startup companies often deploy
  technologies such as Internet, e-commerce, computers,
  telecommunications, or robotics.</p>

<p>According to Neil Blumenthal, co-founder and CEO of Warby Parker,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup is a company working to solve a problem where the solution
  is not obvious and success is not guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Investopedia,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup is a young company that is just beginning to develop.
  Startups are usually small and initially financed and operated by a
  handful of founders or one individual. These companies offer a product
  or service that is not currently being offered elsewhere in the
  market, or that the founders believe is being offered in an inferior
  manner.</p>

"Idea from an outsider on how to make a flopping startup soar - what are some standard methods of approach?","68","","<p>Say an internet startup</p>

<ul>
<li>has an on-paper brilliant and original idea</li>
<li>gets some venture capital to implement it</li>
<li>sets up a website, and</li>
<li>runs some big ads in big media.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the website gets little traffic, because its conceptualisation and design are so appallingly bad. The founders don't know how to implement their idea, they can't even write good copy, and their site comes across as if it's a turnkey mom-and-pop store trying to look like a global bank, with a couple of texts thrown in that look like a cross between Christmas <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_letter"" rel=""nofollow"">round-robin letters</a> and a high-school student's attempt at journalism. Their investor can't help much either, being used to funding some flops in with the occasional gem, a known operational hazard in dotcom investing.</p>

<p>Some of the founders prepare to move on. Others know the idea is brilliant :) but what they're waiting for is...someone who</p>

<ul>
<li>moseys in as a user</li>
<li>""gets"" the idea and its brilliance, and</li>
<li>is willing to supply some clues and the necessary ingredient of some knowledge of how to kick it into shape and get it off the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>The person they're looking for probably has no great business or startup experience, but he understands the concept and its workability, which few do and which the venture capital investor doesn't. And in about three hours he could show the founders that</p>

<ul>
<li>""you've got to do X""</li>
<li>""you've got to do Y the way they do it at A""</li>
<li>""you've got to know about Z"" so on,</li>
</ul>

<p>The poor founders didn't even know about X, Y, A and Z, but they will get the point right away, and together with the person who has approached them they could shift the startup into the right direction for being a big-time success. Because the idea was always brilliant, right? :)</p>

<p>Obviously they can't advertise for such a person, because essentially they'd be saying they don't know how to implement their idea, which doesn't look good. But they want to be open to an approach from such a person if one exists among their users.</p>

<p>Let's turn it around and look at it from the point of view of the user who knows how to implement the idea properly. The last thing he wants to do is to email the startup and say here's what you've got to do. If they get what he's saying, they'll just do what he says. Thanks, mate. He won't get anything for his troubles. He'll just have helped them multiply their turnover by 100 and start reaping large profits, for free.</p>

<p>Essentially he wants to tell them stuff but on condition that they can only use it if they pay him - both a consultancy fee and in shares, and also in a share option. The problem is that what he tells them isn't necessarily easily showable to be something that they couldn't work out for themselves, even if in practice it's clear at the moment that they're not working it out for themselves.</p>

<p>My question is this: what are some standard methods of approach that the said user might use?</p>
","<p>Before I begin with a few pointers that may help lead you in the right direction I think it is necessary to start with the harsh reality.</p>

<p>Going off of what you said, it is clear to see that there are a number of issues with this startup, and almost all of the issues have to do with execution. It is good to keep in mind that an original idea is great (and almost always is a fallacy) but everything in a startup is about execution and if there really isn't anyone on your team that can execute the idea then maybe it is time too look and ask 2 questions...</p>

<ol>
<li>Are we the right team to execute this idea?</li>
<li>If not, then is there someone we can bring on as CEO to help us execute? (Remember, CEO often mean Cheif Execution Officer to a startup!)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>But beyond that, here are some things I would suggest.</p>

<p>It seems that your startup ""idea"" suffers from a lack of customer development. There are many books out there on this subject but I would suggest starting with ""Running Lean"" by Ash Maurya.</p>

<p>The premise is this. It doesn't matter how groundbreaking your idea is, if you do not have a market that is interested in it then all of your work is for nothing. </p>

<p>You need to think about who your target customer is (place a bet as they say) and then go out and find these people to interview, you are looking to see if they have the problem you are looking to solve. When you can validate that a specific (identifiable) group of people have the problem then you can show them the solution, let them play with it and then get their honest feedback about it. This could be a clickable prototype but should be something that changes and iterates over time as you get more feedback.</p>

<p>It will be difficult to find a user who will tell you exactly what to do, but what you are looking for is someone who feels the pains you are trying to solve, and feels them enough that they are willing to give good feedback, meet with you multiple times, and eventually pay for the product. </p>

<p>There will likely never be a ""do Y to get X"" scenario because each startup is different, but startups are all about learning. Learning about your customers (as shown above) as well as learning the mountain of things that your particular startup needs. In your case you mentioned copy writing (lots of great advice both online and in books on this), design (every startup needs someone who is competent in design!). If your team is incapable of learning these things then it is time to start earmarking people who would be good hires and reevaluating if your current team should be kept on board (evaluate what each person is contributing, dead weight founders can lead to a sinking ship).</p>

<hr>

<p>If you cannot find some excited users to have as early adopters then it is time to assess the idea and see if it offers enough value for customers to pay for in the first place. If not, then it is time to cut your losses and move on.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best of luck! </p>

"If you want to start a business that you don't ever plan on selling, is it still a ""startup""?","68","","<p>It seems to me that many startups have a goal of burning bright and fast in order to get larger companies to buy them out.  What if you want to ""startup"" a tech business but you don't want to sell it?  For example, if your business model focuses on empowering workers with a democratic employee-directed enterprise, with long-term career stability, while also providing the best services to your clients?  Can you still label yourself a startup?  Participate in startup-focused events like local networking galas or MS Bizspark?  Or does it go against the accepted industry definition to say you're a startup but you're not going to be for sale... ever?

<p>Generally, meaning is more important than semantics but since this question is strictly about semantics, I thought I would mention the above two points.</p>

<p>Typically people use the term <strong><em>startup</em></strong> to describe where a company is in its <strong><em>life cycle</em></strong> and not necessarily:</p>

<p>Or they see our product is <strong>nice to have</strong> not <strong>must have</strong></p>
","<p>Please hop over to this related question before reading what follows:</p>

<p><a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/12516/process-of-obtaining-leads/12539#12539"">Process of obtaining leads?</a></p>

<p>Back? Great.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After completeding mvp we started to visit some customers to get feedback about our product. So far we visited 5 customer + 1 machine producer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One nitpick if I may. You don't have an MVP. The V in there stands for Viable. And the test to know if it's viable is, well, that it's selling. So you only have an MP: Minimum Product. Your mission as a startup is to turn it into an MVP.</p>

<p>Going through your prospects one by one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customer1: he liked the idea but he is not the owner he said he needs to ask his father he said his father is old style man may not want to pay money for this kind of things.And they are in progress of moving shopfloor and he was thinking to implement this kind of solution in new location</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No decision, no timeline, no budget. Probably no pain either. Not qualified.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customer2: He said that they need this kind of solutions because they keep such information in excell and they cannot reach from everywhere. But they were also moving to new location. he said they will consider this in new location</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pain, presumably decision, no timeline yet. Nurture if you're guessing there will be a budget.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customer3: He seemed intrested he said he knows this kind of solutions he said send us price offer. But at this meeting we didn't act much confident somehow he is not interested anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likely not enough pain or no timeline, but follow up regardless: ""Hi, we met a short while ago to discuss X. I was wondering if you've an update for me on when you think things will move forward."" A deal isn't lost until a prospect says no. Don't forget to politely ask why when they say no.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Producer: This one produces our target machines.They said we can work together and integrate to their machines. But they gave us future schedule to meet and consider again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow up to ask when if you don't already know precisely when. (FYI you're not doing your sales job properly if you don't know who should touch base, when, and with what at the end of a meeting.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customer4: This one we went last week he also said its nice but he will hire some manager to implement this kind of technologies.So we must wait for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably pain, but no decision or timeline yet. Likewise, follow up to ask when if you don't already know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Customer5: This was also said nice idea nice system. He asked price and told its seems little bit expensive ( our compatitors ask 15k just for license which we don't) i explained him. He said maybe we can start with 3 machines ( if he gets the bid ) he didn't ask for current machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not enough info to guess. FYI one of the better ways to answer a price objection is not to become defensive, but rather to act somewhat surprised and flip the objection on its head: ""Oh really?! I don't get that a lot. Can you give me some details on what you're comparing us with?"" Price objections can stem from all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p>Naturally, there's the occasional competitor that's offering something better or cheaper or more in line with what they need. Take notes when that occurs, as it may lead you to revisit what you're offering and how you're selling it. (This is how you get the V bit in MVP.)</p>

<p>Other times, there apparently is a want (though not necessarily a need) but no sensible budget to put in front. Scratch beneath the surface and you'll periodically find that it's because the prospect doesn't understand the extent of their own pain or how you'll be addressing it (or not) or how you'll make their life easier on top (or not). Politely spell things out, including when you're a bad fit. (Better no deal than an unhappy, pain-in-the-rear client.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our website is not ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the very least put one online. Even a single page that lays out what you're offering exactly helps tremendously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or they see our product is nice to have not must have</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't lose hope yet. You did things right so far, in that you built the product with a real user instead of guessing requirements, and you've been meeting new prospects since. You'll eventually figure out indicators that this or that type of prospect is more likely to buy and why, etc. Interact with enough prospects and you'll get there eventually - if there actually <em>is</em> a genuine market, of course.</p>

"What are the different ways to work with Students?","67","","<p>I have a side project that I've been working part time on for ~6 months and I would now like to take it to the next step. I specialize in backend and don't have time and design talent to do lot of web design or frontend programming. </p>

<p>As a solution to my problem, I've thought about the idea of bringing a student on board. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there are several universities in the area.</p>

<p>My question is three-fold.</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I reach out to universities or college students?</li>
<li>Do all universities have paid internships available? If so, how much should I expect to pay an intern?</li>
<li>Might grad students be open to working on a side project in exchange for equity?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am still unsure if this side project will turn into an actual business, so I would like to limit my spending as much as possible.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How do I reach out to the university?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Call them, email them, go there...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do all universities have paid internship? How much should I expect to pay for internship?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the university and on the intern.</p>

<p>How much did you work for as an intern? (Assuming you did an internship at all...)</p>

<p>What about your classmates? Your friends? Your family members?</p>

<p>On this side of the pond, an intern's compensation can be anywhere between zero and the full salary of a post-graduate -- there's no magic formula.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are grad students open to work on a side project for future equity bases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some might. But two questions.</p>

<p>Firstly, are you sure they'll be able to allocate the needed time? Particularly when they've exams, term projects, term papers, or whatever it is that they do nowadays.</p>

<p>Secondly, wouldn't you be better off partnering or working with someone who has a bit more experience? (There are examples of founders that launch successful startups in their early 20s, but your odds of doing so increase as you get more seasoned.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other avenues or options are welcome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're comfortable with overseeing someone technical, you can find cheap labor on freelance sites like eLance, oDesk, etc. (There's some chaff, to put it politely, so start with small tasks.)</p>

<p>Besides that, network... Ask your family and friends if they know someone who might be interested in partnering, look into cofounder matching sites like Cofounders Lab, check out local meetup.com events, go to local startup meetups, etc. For all you know you might find one or two cofounders.</p>

"What are the required and recommended legal steps to launch a web app and associated company?","67","","<p>I am developing a subscription-based web app, with free tier, and am getting to the point where I need to have more concrete plans regarding setting up a company (LLC, I think) and protecting my company and web app legally and otherwise.</p>

<p>What are the steps I should take? It would be helpful if steps are in order and tagged as required, recommended, or strictly optional but a good idea.</p>

<p>Some things that might be included are copyrighting, trademarking, business licensing, banking, terms of service, privacy policy, etc.</p>

<p>If I can add anything to my question to help you answer it, please leave a comment.</p>
","<p>Here are my recommendations in order of priority:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an LLC in your home state.  This is fairly easy to do and you can do it yourself.  Just look at publicly available corporate docs for similar companies and use those as a guide. You want to do this in your home state because if you do it in another state, you'll have to register in your own state anyway so that creates twice as much paperwork and fees.</li>
<li>Set up a bank account for the business, and if needed, PayPal, credit card etc.  It is very easy to get a business credit card.  IMPORTANT: <strong>Completely</strong> separate your personal finances from your company finances. This makes accounting and taxes much easier.</li>
<li>Write up Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.  If your business is low risk (i.e., very unlikely that customers would ever sue you), then you can do this yourself by looking at docs for similar companies and using them as a guide. If your business has some risk, then find a lawyer to do them for you.</li>
<li>Trademark -- You get common law trademark rights just by using it.  For many businesses that is enough.  For most web apps, you probably don't need a registered trademark</li>
<li>Patent and copyright -- You get copyright rights automatically just by publishing and adding the (C) symbol.  Patents are very expensive and the value depends on the amount of novelty in your business.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the great things about single-member LLCs is that taxes are really easy.  It is called pass-through taxation so you are basically taxed the same way as if you were an employee (but there is an extra self-employment tax).  It is just an extra schedule to your annual tax returns so you can do this yourself as well and don't necessarily need to hire an accountant.</p>

"What indicates if an anti-X product will be worth pursuing?","67","","<p>I'm currently working at a tech startup trying to build a consumer facing, anti-X product.

X is a product that is largely regarded as a bully and unethical in practice, but has been around for over a decade, is widely used, and is still the go-to in its field.</p>

<p>Unseating a 800-pound gorilla is proving more difficult and slower than we had anticipated. We've looked at successful examples of this in the past. Digg to Reddit seems to be because the business not listening to its users, Lotus to Office because of complacency and a better product coming around, and the same for Facebook to MySpace.</p>

<p>What are some ways ways to build an anti-X product? Feature matching and then improving based on user input, as well as better design and usability, isn't proving very fruitful. Taking the moral and transparent business practices route doesn't seem to be enticing to users either.</p>
","<p>This is very hard question (or rather questions).</p>

<p>It's not enough to have a superior product in terms of features as you have noticed yourself.</p>

<p>With well established competitors you have to take into account the issue of transaction costs. These are the costs customers have to incur to make the switch. Not all of them are of monetary nature.</p>

<p>You mentioned that they're on the market for over a decade. I don't know whether Product X is for businesses or individuals but that's a very long time to have whole infrastructure built upon their solutions. These are training and processes but also unwilingness to learn new tool (even if it's easier or better or both), existing SLAs (service level agreements) with incumbent, etc.</p>

<p>One of the ways to overcome transactional costs is to educate potential users of benefits they can get from using your product over 'theirs'. And show them that a learning curve isn't steep or the product will save time.</p>

<p>Try to conduct a thought experiment: imagine that you run an organisation that extensively uses Microsoft Excel. Virtually anything is done in Excel workbooks starting from finance to HR to sales to CRM. Now some startup shows up and tells you that they have a better solution - all these workbooks can be consolidated into one package. </p>

<p>What would you do? Would you switch immediately or do an assessment to see what's more viable to your organisation? </p>

<p>What would be a selling point for you to incur big costs in short term but save massively in long run?</p>

<p>How would you deal with all stakeholders? All these people that spent the last 10 years learning ins and outs of Excel?</p>

<p>Answering these hard questions will help you to develop right strategy how attack you competitor.</p>

I could speak to the ""parent"" industry (email service providers) - but my startup isn't technically an email service provider itself. </p>

<p>What should I say about the market in my pitch deck when my market is largely undefined?</p>
","<p>From my own experience, there is always a specific market and a way to define it, but sometimes it isn't obvious who your customers/users are. In a new market or where you make radical change, the definition can be difficult, but always possible. </p>

<p>Maybe you need to ask yourself, who the market is in a different way?</p>

<p>Who is the market for email and how to define it, could be asked with these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who has a need for communication</li>
<li>How many people have access via a computer and internet</li>
<li>For whom is sending letters via the internet an improvement over simply sending a mail</li>
<li>What needs can email cover</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>When I was starting a project database for students and companies to share knowledge with one another, I had a hard time defining the market, since no such database existed to my knowledge. I knew the number of students and companies, but needed to define the number of paying customers. How could I do that, when wasn't any companies paying for such a service at the moment.</p>

<p>The way I did it, was to look at similar services, such as a job-database. Here I could see the amount of money companies would spend, which gave me some idea of a value for my own project. Then I called around 50 companies asking them, what they would pay for my service. Most of them where quit open and gave some good feedback.</p>

"Incorporation in Luxembourg or France?","66","","<p>Both countries are neighbours, speak the same language and you do not require specific visas to go from one country to another.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you had to choose a country where to create your company, which one would it be ?</p>

<p>It seems that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Taxes policy is much better for companies in Luxembourg </li>
<li>Raising funds is easier in Luxembourg</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand :</p>

<ul>
<li>France proposes a lot of helps or subsidisations (BPI, CIR, JEI...) </li>
<li>Life is cheaper in most French cities than in Luxembourg</li>
</ul>
","<p>Incorporate the company <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/6221/what-major-things-to-consider-when-starting-a-company-overseas-without-being-phy/7873#7873"">where you live</a> for reasons covered <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1592/tax-structuring-how-to-pay-no-corporate-tax/1665#1665"">in this other question</a>. The TR;DR version is that it's not worth risking the cavity-search grade tax audits that you'll get down the road for incorporating a company out of the country you reside in. (If you choose to ignore the advice then Luxembourg usually is a good choice - but then so are the usual suspects e.g. Estonia, Malta, Cyprus, Ireland, or for that matter places like Lichtenstein and many more outside of Europe.)</p>

<p>Now, assuming you actually live or intend to move in either of these countries, I'm rather suspicious about your assertion that it'll be that easier for you to raise funds in Luxembourg. It might easier to find money for e.g. mezzanine financing or an MBO - i.e. there are bankers and VCs that pour money into mature companies - but there are plenty of options for this in France as well and you'd have incorporated long before. For early stage startups methinks double check.</p>

<p>Also, dig a bit deeper on the taxes, because the raw corporate tax only partially captures the costs. Other things that count include personal income taxes (note that brackets put forward often are the maximum ones, where you presumably won't fit), whether you're taxed differently depending on it being a salary or a dividend, what you're allowed to dump into company expenses, social security and retirement, how much capital you'll need to incorporate, whether or not an expensive yearly audit done by an accountant is mandatory (which might be the case in Lux), etc.</p>

<p>As to France, life is mostly cheaper outside of Paris indeed. A slew of aid programs also exists, but they often come with some kind of strings attached so double-check that too.</p>

<p>Last but not least, don't forget quality of life. In case you've never spent any time in Lux, it's a small city with a lot of grey weather that goes to sleep at 10pm for all practical purposes. Which is fine and all if that's your thing or when you're middle aged and settled with a spouse; it might not be <em>that</em> great if you're twenty-something and single.</p>

<p>I'll thus answer with this tip: incorporate where you want to live.</p>

"Increase company valuation during funding","66","","<p>I met an investor two weeks ago, at that time I asked him for € X,000 for X percent.</p>

<p>I'll meet him soon, is it ok to ask for more than the first time we met ?</p>

<p><em>E.g.</em> : Ask him for € 2X,000 euro still for X percent?</p>

<p>Is this a common thing (to change the figures from one appointment to the other) or will he feel cheated ?</p>
","<p>Validation creates value. So your idea to ask for more money makes great logical sense, as long as there's something very solid behind the beta sign-ups. (Solid in this context is probably going to mean the same as ""sufficient evidence of engagement to provide forecastable revenue."" If it isn't solid, you haven't got validation - certainly not validation worth 2X.)</p>

<p>So much for logic. However, two weeks is a <em>very</em> short time. Thinking relationally, there's a real chance you will cause offence, unless the meeting was pretty casual, or your discussion pointed the way to this likelihood (for instance if you based your prior valuation on some metrics that you can legitimately revise upward). </p>

<p>All in all, I think it may be better all round to view your next meeting as a progress report against the deal already discussed. If you're already turning ambitions in the pitch into achievements, from the investor's point of view you are starting to look credible, a better risk that rival pitches that aren't making progress pre-funding, and perhaps a deal they should do. </p>

<p>Assume I had two version of my product (let's call it a paid version of StackExchange). </p>

</ol>

<p>Would a potential client look at both sites and pick the ""premium"" one just because it looks and feels premium?</p>

<p>(Any reading on the subject would be greatly appreciated as well!)</p>
","<p>How cow. There is a Huuuuge correlation between product pricing and customer perception of the product (and vice versa).</p>

<p>As both a longtime serial entrepreneur, marketer, and behavioral economist - I can tell you that there are a series of Nobel prize winning studies on this. And at any time you can see the results, every day, all over the web.  Something as simple as, the choices presented to you for choosing a subscription: (e.g Free - a reasonable subscription - and a ridiculously high price).</p>

<p>A great (probably apocryphal) case is when the owner of a touristy boutique store, was going on vacation, and she wanted the languishing stock of inexpensive $5 costume jewelry to sell quickly while she was away. She quickly scrawled a note saying to reduce the price to $1.00 each.</p>

<p>When she returned. All the jewelry had sold out! a nice surprise. An ever better  surprise was the PILE of cash the store made. Tens of thousands of dollars!  It turns out that her handwriting was bad, and the manager instead marked the price of all the costume jewelry at $100 each.  </p>

<p>All the customers had a new perception of the value of the product. It was no longer cheap tourist junk... it was a semi-precious memento from the trip.</p>

<p>And it gets even more interesting.  You see - for the tourists, buying jewelry for $1 or $5 meant parting with precious CASH (tourist customers usually want to minimize trips to the ATM).  But a $100 item is a credit card purchase - much easier.</p>

<p>Anyway - their perception of the product, it's value etc ... all changed due to the pricetag.</p>

<p>Now - in high tech. Aside from citing you vast research, let me give you a real example from personal experience:</p>

<p>Many many years ago (during the PC software boom era) my company developed a software product that rivaled the mainframe products being sold to fortune 500 companies. </p>

<p>Our product was more modern, had better features, more features etc... and it only took us a few months to develop and market.  At the time, PC software like this might sell for $400, or in that ballpark.  </p>

<p>When we were trying to sell our software to the Fortune 500 corporations, for the first year, NO ONE would ever consider buying our software.  It was perceived as a cheap toy. There was No Way would they consider replacing their mainframe software (that probably cost $10,000 per YEAR) and bet on a $400 product.</p>

<p>(remember the mainframe software took years to develop, was much older, but the capital costs were high. We used modern PC software techniques to duplicate and then outshine all the feature/functions. Our capital costs were minuscule compared with our big competitor)</p>

<p>So, we raised our price. We changed our pricing structure etc etc. We changed the name of the software (so we had a small business product and an enterprise product).  Once we did this, the Fortune 500 corporations looked at our product differently. Doors opened.  Purchase orders flowed, and we made millions$$</p>

<p>Product perception matters!</p>

<p>I have been asked to provide figures for an advanced against royalties and royalty rate. I am aware of what these things are but have no comparison, for which to provide my values.</p>
","<p>The best advice would be to research comparison rates in your industry. What are people doing your sort of work getting for their work? What should you expect both as an advance and in ongoing royalties?</p>

<p>The publishing industry could provide you with a similar vein as far as royalties and advances go, but depending on the nature of your game, the policies of the company you are working for and the state of the industry you might be off by an order of magnitude.</p>

<p>If this is something you can (legally) take to other firms who might make a bid on it make sure to consider doing that. It will be much better for you to have options on the deal especially if they let you develop a meaningful understanding of what you are worth.</p>

"Should I accept ad-honorem work in exchange of teaching?","66","","<p>A System's Engineering student from a college in my town offered me free development work in exchange of my team teaching him how to code. We are currently starting the development of our product so it would be perfect timing to acquire a new member that asks nothing as payment, what should I consider if we accept his proposal? Thanks</p>
","<p>It sounds like you're looking to pretty well bring this person on as an unpaid intern. There are definitely aspects of that to take into consideration, but it is pretty common practice.</p>

<p>That said, there are definitely some things to think about.</p>

<h2>Nothing's really free...</h2>

<p>First is what's expected of unpaid interns. There was a court ruling--I can try and find it if you need--about internships, wherein the decision was essentially that an unpaid intern needs to get more from you than you do from them. That's really targeted at practices like making an intern run for coffee when they should be coding, though, so it's probably not too much a concern for you. Just something to take into consideration.</p>

<h2>...including your time.</h2>

<p>Along those same lines, make sure you have time to teach the person. Don't expect them to write production-ready code on the first day. It can take years to learn how to program without getting tripped up too often, as I'm sure you know, and many more years on top of that to learn how to program well.</p>

<p>If this person has some experience just fiddling around with code, that can tell you two excellent things: they probably have the basics down--at least the silly stuff like what a method or class is and how they're used--and they probably love it, since they're willing to spend their free time on it.</p>

<h2>Programming is about more than writing code.</h2>

<p>Remember, in all this, that while the person may go into this looking to learn how to code, and you might go into this looking to teach them and get some free stuff written, that there's a lot more to software development than <code>new List&lt;string&gt;()</code>, and even code itself can be somewhat complex, emotionally. I imagine many developers will know what I mean by that. Or else I'll sound really weird right now. Either way.</p>

<p>When you bring someone on that has zero experience, expect them to want to jump right in. When I first learned how to program (granted, I was eight), the first thing I wanted to write was a video game. It's hard to grasp when you're new to something, how much work it takes. That goes for you and for the intern: they'll want to get started fast, and you'll want them to. But that's not how you build good products, or developers. Be ready to take the time with them.</p>

<p>Along those same lines, and speaking to my actual point in this section, it can be hard to know what you really want right off the line. This could be read as an argument to never allow anyone new ever to code, and obviously I don't mean that, but remember that when the intern starts, they might get bored of it, or find the developer's life isn't for them. Humans aren't guaranteed investments. That's true for full-time hires, but it's particularly true for someone who's never done any of it before.</p>

<h2>It may not last forever.</h2>

<p>This could probably go unsaid, it's pretty obvious, but to the same effect as my previous paragraph, remember that an unpaid intern might not stick around forever. You might train them to code, then they can go off and find someone who's willing to pay them. This is kind of the opposite of my previous point: there, I was saying that they might not like it or be good at it, here, they might love it and be amazing, and move on.</p>

<p>Hopefully that's not much of an issue, because at that point they'll have enough morale in your company and you'll be ready to pay them, but keep it in mind.</p>

<p>The time it takes for someone to hit that point is difficult to predict, and you might be able to make the situation more reliable through the use of contracts, but that won't do anything for morale.</p>

<p>Just try and keep people happy, and hopefully this won't be too much of an issue.</p>

<h2>It's just like any other hire.</h2>

<p>Finally, just remember that an unpaid intern is just like any other hire at a human level. You want someone who's keen and excited about what they're doing, and someone who gets along well with the team.</p>

<p>Again, this is probably pretty obvious, but it's easy to look at interns differently, as more of a temporary assignment, and while that's often the case, you still want someone who will keep your company happy for the duration of their stay, especially with so many intern turning into full-time employees these days.</p>

<p>You don't have to be as strict about prior knowledge, obviously, as you might be with a paid employee, but be careful not to undervalue their impact on the team's dynamic, especially in a small startup.</p>

"what to do to enter business partnership","66","","<p>I am a software developer with no experience in business, I have recently developed a proof of concept software solutions leveraging plugins and frameworks available on wordpress to provide a solution for a problem the education industry currently has. I have presented this solution to a possible client within that sector who seemed very interested in the solution.</p>

<p>They felt it would defiantly solve a particular issue faced by the sector and at the end of the meeting they discussed they discussed the option of moving forward into a partnership. The idea was that they would use the software in there institutes and then have it as an investment/business opertunity for their institute,  one of the comments made by them was referring to on selling and something regarding the Intellectual property (however I wasn’t too sure what this referred too due to my lack of experience).</p>

<p>My initial feeling is that they would give the product validity by backing it and using it themselves and at the same time help drive its potential success, and I would be the one to make and maintain it.</p>

<p><strong>My questions are;</strong> </p>

<p>Question 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am leveraging wordpress plugins which I have licenses for then
  adding additional functionally myself to produce the desired outcome,
  dose this constitute intellectual property?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I proceed to the next step of partnering with them? I have said
  I would provide them with a proposal document outlining what I have
  done so far, what needs to be done before the product is ready…
  however I am not sure this is even the next logical step to take? What
  is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What issues should I be aware of before entering into such a
  partnership?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have gotten this far,  thank you very much for taking the time to read. Any suggestions previous experiences you have had I would love to hear as this has been a big weight on my mind not knowing the answers or having anyone to talk to.</p>
","<p><strong>PROPOSAL</strong></p>

<p>The proposal document sounds very good.  Make sure it is a organized and professional as possible, and be careful not to disclose anything proprietary.  (i.e. you give them the ""high level"" explanation, but avoid specific details of how you do it until you have a contract.) Alternately, you can have them sign a non-disclosure if you do need to disclose something proprietary.  You can find boiler-plate NDA's online, but an attorney is always recommended per what are known as ""terms of art"" and a knowledge of legal precedent in the form of case law.</p>

<p>This will get very complicated if you decide to move forward with partnership, because you'll have to hammer out the details of ownership and equity.  However, if they are worth partnering with, it is worth the trouble.</p>

<p><strong>PARTNERSHIP</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most Important: Transparency</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If, when you get to the contract stage, everything is above board and spelled out, and the deal is a win-win for both parties, these are people you want to work with.</p></li>
<li><p>If, when you get to the contract stage, things are unclear or shady or it seems like a bad deal for you, do not partner with them as they will most likely rip you off.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, you have the skills and it's your sweat.  That doesn't mean you're entitled to the lion's share, because making a product is very different from selling a product, and the sales/biz dev people make the most money for a reason (not least because we techies don't want to deal with the stuff the sales/biz dev people deal with, which involves a very particular skill set.)  But within that framework, there is still a fair and equitable share for you.  Depending on the size of their company, that could range from a fraction of a percent to a nice big chunk.</p>

<p>If they are not offering equity partnership, but a licensing partnership for your code, transparency is still paramount. Who owns the code?  What protections do you have?  What guarantees?  Do you have a way to gauge the revenues to confirm what you should be getting paid?</p>

<p>This is just for starters, and there are definitely people on Startups that have more knowledge and expertise than I. (Hopefully, as this moves along, you can attract an answer from one of them and get even more precise advice.)</p>

<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION</strong></p>

<p>Regarding IP, the cheapest way to initially protect the type of stuff your working on is though provisional patents.  You don't technically need a lawyer for a provisional, but you should do the research to make sure you understand what needs to be in there.  There are also ""mills"" that offer provisional patent filings at a small markups above the filing fees. For a non-provisional patent DO NOT use these mills, as the resulting filing would likely be worthless, but provisional patents have very loose requirements, thus mills can suffice for that.</p>

<p>Copyright may also provide some protection regarding the code, and you should definitely research that more.  Copyright protection is automatic, but it can help if you formally file a document with the Copyright office. Copyright is quite affordable.  Here is the current fee schedule: </p>

<p>Especially in this case, my belief is that there is no reciprocal (or whatnot) relationship between blossom and any of these other companies.  </p>

<p>By trusted could their lawyer logic be, ""this company does not mistrust us, therefore they trust us.""?</p>
","<p>I would take that to mean that they are, in fact, being used by those companies.</p>

<p>While I can see where you're coming from with the ""lawyer logic"" you proposed, that doesn't really take into account the trademark issues. Most companies have limitations on the use of their brand assets to say that you can't use them in a way that makes them look to be endorsing you, and since that's what this company is doing, they either have a special license (which would indicate that it's true) or they're breaking the TOS.</p>

<p>I'm certainly in no position to comment on which end of those this actually is, but it looks like a pretty legit site so I'm inclined to give them at the very least, the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>But yes, speaking to the more broadly applicable case, I would read ""trusted by"" to mean ""used by,"" and I suspect most other people would as well. As such, it could quite possibly be called false advertising (since it's heavily misleading) to use it to express nothing more than ""a lack of mistrust.""</p>

","<p>First, expect to fail, it happens. The more you fail, the more you learn, the more resilient you become. Keep track of those failures so that when you do suceed, you don't fall victim to the survivor bias. </p>

<p>Second, the more ideas you have, the better. You don't want 1 idea, you want 100 ideas. James Altucher says you should write 10 ideas a day. The vast majority of ideas will fail, which is fine, you only need to have 1 work. That being said, before you can execute on an idea, you need to evaluate it. You need to answer the question of ""who will pay me for this and why?"". If you can identify a particular market segment and a clearly state a value proposition, you can running some targeted tests to ensure your idea will be profitable. The best situation is get people to pay you for your solution before you've started creating it.   </p>

"How much percent of the company do I give","65","","<p>I am starting a <strong>technology startup</strong>.

<p>We also agreed that in the long run I will be the CEO of the company and he will be a chairman.</p>

<p>Now, my question is what's the reasonable percentage of the company that I give him?</p>

<p>We have not yet discussed on percentages yet but before we do I want to know what would be the reasonable percentages.</p>
","<p>How much value will your friend (versus you) offer in intellectual property, time or money? </p>

<p>IP is important though hard to value, money trumps the others. </p>

<p>If you're bringing work with you to the endeavor, that's kinda like bringing money to the table in the form of pre-invested work product, so you could argue that you'd hold a larger share. If you're just bringing an idea and some thoughts sketched out, should probably be an even split. </p>

<p>If one or the other is going to be committing more time to it, that variable could favor one or the other direction a little. But, work is more a salary / compensation thing. Stock option grants can be part of compensation to reward him for bringing on advantageous investors, things like that.  </p>

<p>Re: money, </p>

<ul>
<li>If your friend ends up putting the majority of the starting money up, he gets most of the company/shares, because the initial risk is his. </li>
<li>If he finds other investors and doesn't put in the money, they get most of both of your shares, unless you already have revenue. </li>
<li>If you have revenue before you secure investors, you have leverage to claim an existing valuation and price their contribution against it. The closer you are to positive cash flow, the stronger your argument is and the smaller the share you have to give away. </li>

<p>For example (purely fictional): I'm fascinated with longboarding... I just love it. Something about the thrilling, yet all the while relaxing, feeling of speeding down a hill, or cruising to the coffee-shop enthralls me. But I'm even more captivated by the idea of merging electricity with beautiful tools, like the longboard... imagine a fuel efficient, electric longboard, priced fairly for consumers - enabling a new, light, standard for college campus transportation. That's where I'd like to take my (theoretical) company.</p>

<p>For the sake of the example, I know nothing about electric fuel cells, nothing about material, and nothing about manufacturing. In short, I'm not an engineer.</p>

<p><b>Should I worry about the people first, or the product first?</b></p>

<p><b>If the people come first</b>, how should I go about finding/employing them when I don't know them, nor have any real tangible product to show them?</p>

<p><b>If the product comes first</b>, should I learn engineering, then worry about people later so that I have something to show them?</p>
","<p>Neither. The first thing should be the customers. Outline the characteristics of your product and then find out </p>

<li>Are the people's need for your specific take on the product met by a similar product (competing product)</li>
<li>How is your product different from the competitors and would it be easy to tell the customers how it is different.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of beginners make the mistake of making a product simply because they can or because they love the concept themselves. Both are bad reasons to start with. Some people luck out as their concept turns out to popular but it is better to have some estimates before you spend a lot of effort and money making it. The more you unique your product is, the easier it would be to get partners interested in as well. </p>

<p>After you have gauged the market, do a skill assessment and find out how far your skills can take you. Can you draw a sketch? Can you make a prototype by yourself? Can you fund it yourself? Can you convince a distributor to carry your product? Where you find a skill lacking, get somebody to help. When you get somebody else, keep these in mind. </p>

<p>People rarely do things for free. You would have to give them something to get something from them. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you give them shares, you end up loosing ownership in your companies, have to divide profits and have less decisive authority in your own company. Advantage is you maybe able to get some work done without any or with smaller upfront payments. </p></li>
<li><p>If you give them wages, you don't loose ownership but you have to pay them. </p></li>
<li><p>If they owe you a favor, you can call it in. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Order like this - favors first, wages second and last, give up equity in your company. </p>

Of course this comes at a cost. </p>

<p>Assuming that what I write is accurate, what is the way to go about doing this?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>Expanding on what I threw in as comments, you usually want to find buyers first, then worry about funding, and finally worry about building.</p>

<p>It can seem counterintuitive at first but that order actually has it correct. If you build first, you may very well end up in a situation where there's no funding and no clients down the road. If you fund first, and then build, you may realize down the road that there are no buyers to sell to. There are mass graves out there full of startups with fell for either trap, and almost as many stories of investors that poured money into a project that was dead on arrival.</p>

<p>So find - and <em>prove</em> - your addressable market first. Doing so will literally solve 95% of your problems. Whatever your funding needs are you'll find plenty of opportunities, and you'll never have the stress that comes with building something that you're not sure will sell or the disillusion and the cold shower that come when the sorry realities of the market kick in after you've spent months believing your product will sell like hotcakes.</p>

<p>I'd stress that you want actual clients rather than buddies and friends who tell you ""yeah, I'd buy this."" You'll <em>also</em> find plenty of stories out there of businesses that started with founders who were confident that they'd get buyers without realizing that, come the moment of truth where the folks they asked need to pull out their checkbook, they discover that ""actually, this cool thing we told you we'd buy isn't as critically needed on second thought"" or ""ouch, I hadn't realized it would be that expensive, maybe it's not that important after all."" That is why you want some kind of written commitment: a promise to buy at (perhaps even up to) a certain price point by email is fine.</p>

<p>You don't need a functioning prototype to sell. You can make do with a couple of slides that show key screens or whatever. Or some visual prototype built with Balsamiq or equivalent. Or really with nothing at all, in practice - visual help often distract from the business goal and the problem in need of a solution. Your ideal early adopters will have an ""OMG this here is such a pain, please shut up and take this money as an advance payment to sort it out"" type of problem. You need to find them, and the way to do that is to actively try to meet them.</p>

"When exactly can a company/startup go full remote?","64","","<p>I know there are a lot of questions about remote working. However, this one is different.</p>

<p>Generally, there is a notion which says that the bonding between the first 10 members of the company is very important.</p>

<p><strong>So, can a startup be full-remote from the #3 employee (2 are co-founders) and still have that bond and speed which the startups who have their first employees in the same office/dorm?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is it advisable? Or is there an advised time/size//milestone after which a company can go full-remote and keep enjoying the same pace of growth as the ones which aren't?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why I want to go full-remote?</strong>
<br>Simply due to the multiple advantages of the full-remote team structure.</p>
","<p>This is primarily opinion based question, but actually in the current work environment in the UK and Australia (and other countries), a higher and higher percentage of workers are moving to fully or partially remote working, so I think this is an important question.</p>

<p>That being said, I think there are some basic things that can assist or detract from building a team of remote workers that are effective as a team.</p>

<p>Here are some aspects of ""team"" that can be potentially lost or diluted by full or partial remote working.</p>

<ul>
<li>Trust. This is often built up by working together in proximity</li>
<li>Communication. Using video conferencing and text-based communications isn't as good as face to face</li>
<li>Efficiency. Knowing each other's strengths and weaknesses is often best understood by working closely together.</li>
<li>Humor, anger and other emotions. These are lost in a lot of contexts when you lack face to face.</li>
</ul>

<p>You say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is a notion which says that the bonding between the first 10 members of the company is very important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see the logic in that, but I'd tweak it slightly and say that the bonding between any members of a team, like the management team is critical, so when new members come in, their inclusion is very important to have a effective working relationship.</p>

<p>In some ways you could say that any team that works closely together would need that extra bond to be as effective as they can be.</p>

<p>Some experiences</p>

<ul>
<li>We run a data consultancy with a London office, but purposely have a policy of flexibility in remote working, but generally we are all in at least 40% of the time, mostly by choice as we like each other. A long term employee works from another country but flies over about once a month for a week. This seems to work fairly well in maintaining connection between him and the rest of us. Though he does feel somewhat isolated when we have discussions in the office which he isn't present for.  So we try to take extra steps to overcome this by take extra time to build relationships with each other over lunch/evening.</li>
<li>A partner company recently changed from office-based staff to all remote working, but once a week they would rent meeting room space and have time that they would work together in the same space to reinforce the personal connections.</li>

"App for selling shoes?","63","","<p>I want to make an app for just selling shoes,I want to sell shoes for comapnay like nike,adidas,etc.How should I start?I mean what should I have to do for taking this idea forward?
thanks in advance:)</p>
","<p>IMHO, you should get your customers to know first. Who are they? How can you reach out to them? Why should they want to buy shoes via an app rather than at a reputable online shop?
So, <strong>first step</strong> could be to conduct a brainstorming, gathering all potential customer target groups, e.g. </p>

<ul>
<li>young women from 21 to 35 years living in a rural area</li>
<li>business men from 30 to 50 years living in Berlin</li>
<li>male / female fitness enthusiasts from 35 to 45 </li>
<li>fashionistas living in urban areas</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't limit yourself in this step, no idea could be weird enough to not be noted down.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> would be, to narrow the identified customer segments down to, say, 6 most suited segments to start with. Note, you want to focus at a very narrow customer segment at the beginning, rather than acting like ""everybody needs to buy shoes, so every consumer is my customer.""
You need to identify your first mover customer segment. The kind of people, who love to try new technology and new shopping trends. When narrowing your customer segments, consider these seven aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>Financial situation of customer segment?</li>
<li>Can I get in contact with them easily?</li>
<li>How urgent is their need to buy?</li>
<li>Could I delivery my product to them today (meaning without any 3rd party dependencies)?</li>
<li>Does customer from this segment see a lot of competition for my product (Note, look through the customer's eyes, not yours. Consider, that not buying from you at all can be the most common option for them, too)?</li>
<li>Is customer segment suitable as a beachhead market? That is, can you easily expand from this customer segment to the next, using the beachhead market as a reference?</li>
<li>Does the customer segment align with your own core values? This point should never be neglected. As an entrepreneur, you'll need to get through a lot of hard times. Working for and with a market segment that correlates with your core beliefs gives you the much needed power of endurance.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Create yourself a matrix with your customer segments and the seven aspects listed above. Then, evaluate each aspect for each segment by giving points from 1 to 10, where 1 is a poor result for a given aspect and 10 is the best value. That way, you can identify your 6 customer segments that you'll target first.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> is customer interviews. Yes, you should actually leave the building and get in contact with your customers. You need to be open to what they have to say and never be pushy or try selling them your idea. Just learn, how they buy shoes today and what problems the might have with the current options. Learn, how they try to overcome these problems with today's means. If done right, you'll collect valuable insights from your customers, which help to finally pick <em>the</em> very first customer segment.</p>

<p>Once you've gone through this first steps, you'll know a lot more about your customers and what problem to actually solve for them. This is just the beginning, though. But identifying your target customer segment and talking to your customers first should prevent you from a <em>build-that-app-and-they-will-come</em> approach, which comes with a high risk of failure.</p>

<p>Hope, that inspires and helps!

<p>Transfer restrictions mean that you are prohibited from selling your stock to just anyone. Among other things, this is to keep the company out of hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<p>A right of first refusal is basically an option for the company to buy your shares back from you first, if you wanted to sell them. The company gets first dibs, and if they pass, then you can sell.</p>

"Focus vs scalability","63","","<p>We are going to participate in a startup contest with a product we are building, a versatile educational platform that can be applied in a lot of different areas. Particularly we are now creating three products based on this platform: a math course, a languages course and a humanities course. They all are so different that they don't seem to be running on the same platform.</p>

<p>In this contest, they request us a detailed description of the project but with a very limited text length. We are not able to describe the platform and all the courses we are building in depth. So we have the following options:</p>

<p><strong>1.-</strong> Describe the platform and not the courses, so we wouldn't show the products that we are really launching</p>

<p><strong>2.-</strong> Describe superficially only the three launching courses, so we wouldn't show the platform and its versatility</p>

<p><strong>3.-</strong> Describe the platform and the courses but very superficially, so we would show almost nothing</p>

<p>Note that in all cases we have also to show a market study, propects, business model, etc.</p>

<p>How would you pitch a product like this, that can have very different types of applications and customers, in a startup contest or to VC?</p>

<p>What would it be better: focus or scalability/versatility?</p>
","<p>For a startup <strong>Focus</strong> is key. Get it working for one specific niche example, get some kind of cash flow and then branch out.</p>

<p>Instead of 3 courses, try to understand which course would create the most value for your customers with the least work from your perspective and do that one first in depth.</p>

<p>For example - maybe 'math' might be the focus:
 easier to recruit math users than humanities? 
 easy to automate marking and give quick feedback...</p>

<p>The platform is a means to enable cheap scaling, from a customer perspective I don't really care too much about the platform as long as things work for me. It might be a mistake to over-invest in the platform before you've validated your product-market fit for at least a couple of different courses.</p>

"How common is it for individuals to acquire a startup?","63","","<p>In David Kirkpatrick's book, Facebook was approached by a ""New York financier"" in 2004 offering 10mm for the company. <br />
Is this unusual ? </p>

<p>How often do individuals (I assume it was an individual) acquire a startup ?</p>
","<p>It is more likely that the financier wanted to acquire the majority of facebook shares on behalf of his company, or on the behalf of another company (which he was a shareholder).</p>

<p>Individuals who put money into companies without operating them are essentially angel investors. But this presumes that the company can operate on its own. Other individuals may buy a company (not a startup - but a small business) so they can either run it themselves, or so they can enjoy a steady revenue stream over many years.</p>

<p>It is rare that an individual would want to buy a pre-revenue startup. By definition, startups are not fully operating companies, and are still searching for the product-market fit. So the individual would have to essentially step in and bring the company to the point where it could be self-sustaining, attract venture investment or be acquired.</p>

<p>But I suppose it does happen. I personally have done this a couple of times (though I would never classify it as an ""acquisition"") - where a small team of 2-3 young entrepreneurs have developed a technology or a product, but really are not suited to bring it to market, or run a company. The tech/product meshes well with other projects I am working on, so I give them some money to ""buy out"" the code, and the IP. This is really more of a IP deal as opposed to an acquisition... </p>

<ol>
<li>Your leads get excited by what you have to offer upon merely hearing about it.</li>
<li>Your prospects worry more about whether they can afford what you have to offer than about whether they actually have any use for it.</li>
<li>Your clients are constantly blabbering about how they're using what you delivered and about the awesome results they're getting from using it.</li>
<li>You're profitable or you're well on your way of being so.</li>

"Ideas how to measure offline conversion rate","63","","<p>We are running a website (portal) where people can find local dealers for a certain product. They have the opportunity to call the dealer or send a request (contact form). Both of these are tracked, but can only be counted as leads. Now, I am looking for inspiration on how to track the sale, that means the person going to the store and buying there. </p>

<p>In the first place, I do not aim for a 100 per cent accuracy. It may also be possible to make a projection. It is extremely important to track those sales, as it is a key performance indicator for our business.</p>

<p>What came to my mind is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask the consumer (per mail) if there was a sale after contacting the dealer. Actually, nobody will answer that question without incentive.</li>
<li>Ask the dealer. They are quite lazy so that would not work very well, either.</li>
<li>Use vouchers for price deductions. The consumer prints it, the dealer validates it (on our site). However, we do high priced, high volume goods which would be quite costly only to retain some figures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anybody have experience in this realm?</p>
","<p>If you're selling face-to-face connection then there isn't any 100% method of tracking, and any feasible mechanism to achieve that is going to change your core proposition.</p>

<p>However, the reasons you need to know include: demonstrating that you're delivering value, improving conversions (through the whole online/offline process) over time etc. For these you need a fair sample of data, just enough to give you a decent view of performance at a point in time and over time.</p>

<p>On the customer side, I would go for an automated email follow-up, asking people to rate the experience. Make it quick and easy, as frictionless as possible. This will give you data, and it will build relationship with your visitors, adding value to your service.</p>

<p>That leaves you with the problems (i) that you don't know how truthful people are being on objective questions; (ii) that you don't know how to map data from respondents to the whole population. So you will want a regular routine of contacting some users who have and some users who haven't responded on a 1-1 basis. In time, you can begin to push this work out to the dealers, adding value to your service (because they're getting structured support in reaching out to actual and prospective customers) and keeping your costs in check.</p>

<p>On the dealer side, I would automate the tracking for them by making your best estimate for leads generated and converted, but allow them to enter their own figures. That way, the lazy ones will see a reassuring graph (and not a suspiciously straight one, as you'll be combining observed, estimated and survey-reported data), while the pro-active ones will be able to compare their performance with others and use the data to improve their processes. If you're worried that their graph shows they're not getting value, that's a warning you can act on.</p>

","<p>After speaking on the phone with the NC Department of Insurance, I can now answer my own question.</p>

<p>In short, Employer's Liability Insurance (ELI) is a legitimate requirement for a Worker's Compensation Insurance (WCI) plan (at least in North Carolina).</p>

<p>While it may not be precisely true that ELI is ""required by law"", it is legitimately part of the requirements of WCI and so not a red flag for a WCI plan. Furthermore, some of the questions that appeared odd to me, such as whether we travel for work or do any subcontracting, were also legitimately related to the worker's comp law.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>They want you to enter a mailing address.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p><em>Process</em> in that paragraph stands for <em>""process service.""</em> A ""<em>process server</em>"" is what they call the person who hand-delivers the law suit papers to you. That's required by law to initiate a law suit. (They might or might not also choose to say something like, ""You have been served."" But that's not necessarily required. They do it in books and movies for dramatic effect.)</p>

<p>So the paragraph says that if somebody wants to sue your company, they can do so by serving papers to the Secretary of State of New York.</p>

<p>Then, in the blank that follows where you cut off your question, you are supposed to enter the address where the Secretary of State can mail you a copy of the law suit papers.</p>

<p>This is necessary so that people will have a way to sue your company even if you move out of state or become difficult to otherwise locate.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Be careful</h3>

<p>The address you enter could be your home, or your attorney or CPA or anywhere you feel comfortable receiving law suit papers.</p>

<p>You will usually have a short period of time to respond to a law suit. Less than 3 weeks is common. (Otherwise, you might forfeit your case!) So you want to choose the address carefully knowing that the mail will be opened in a timely fashion and won't go unopened.</p>

<p>If you're not ticking all of the boxes then no half-decent sales will waste their time on you. If they Google you and discover you're CEO or CTO of a competitor then they won't waste their time on you either. (You might get their boss though, as they may end up wanting to probe into what you're up to and see if you're shopping around for a partnership.)</p>

<p>The way to do this type of stuff is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Come up with a fake persona and a fake company name.</li>
<li>Make things look legit, i.e. have a fake ""coming soon"" website, relevant email addresses, dummy LinkedIn profiles for key staff, perhaps even some social network or forum presence with the personae.</li>
<li>Come up with a targeted scenario to approach each competitor.</li>
<li>Refine the scenario(s) by rehearsing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Put another way, plan. Then call them.</p>

<p>Also: don't sound too knowledgeable when in a sales call. If you do, you'll either get dismissed as ""they don't need us because they know too much about this and can actually do themselves"" or they'll (correctly) conclude it's a fishing expedition.</p>

","<p>I do lots of research and I keep an eye on the ""e business startups"" as you call them.  Sources for my information are Forrester Research, Gallup, Financial Times, Bloomberg and CNBC websites, plus news.google.com and frequent searching there. Also I use my favorite search engine to search for startups fairs as they tend to reference something to promote the idea/concept/aims.</p>

<p>I prefer paper based articles as opposed to the internet and I am lucky enough to have an economics library near home that gets magazines/news papers from some of the sources above that are free to read on site. If you live in/near a big city, it might be worth asking them if they have a similar offering.</p>

<p>Either way, you need be creative with your searches - Taking one source will only give you one opinion which narrows your view.</p>

"How can I measure and better predict the demand for my service","61","","<p>I am a software developer and I.T. professional with additional expertise in blogging and e-reporting</p>

<p>I am wishing to start up a company that will create and manage another company's (client) I.T. systems, online marketing and anything else digital.</p>

<p>The primus of the company is that we will consult any other company on any solution they wish, we will charge for the consultation if a solution is devised and implemented, depending on their contract type we will then manage the solution (e.g. if a company wants a login system, we will create it, create a database of login information, and manage that database for that company if they so wish). We will also provide blogging and social networking services for that company, we will become their outsourced I.T. department and online solution/management team.</p>

<p>I trust that in a world where dependency on IT and online capabilities is growing, demand will be plenty</p>

<p>But how can I better predict and record the amount of demand for my service? Like surveys possibly? But how can I make sure they are answered honestly? Any other way of predicting demand/possible consumer interest?</p>
","<p>Demand forecasting is a big subject - too big for one answer. However, one useful route in for structured activities is to use some six signma tools.</p>

<p>First, map processes SIPOC style: <strong>S</strong>uppliers provide <strong>I</strong>nput to <strong>P</strong>rocesses that generate <strong>O</strong>utputs for <strong>C</strong>ustomers. At each step, you need to identify something (perhaps more than one something) you can count, such as feature requests, booked hours etc.</p>

<p>Each of these can be put into control charts, and (with care - your data volumes will be small), used to gain a better understanding of normal variation. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart"" rel=""nofollow"">This wikipedia page</a> is pretty useful to understand control charts, how to read them, and the problems they're meant to solve.</p>

<p>However, this will help you gain insight into running processes, and make better-grounded forecasts, not solve your immediate need.</p>

<p>You could guess, but that's hard. You could ask them to guess, but even if they know how things work now, that may be a poor basis for how they will behave when you are in place.</p>

<p>So my suggestion is that you make this a ""same side of the table"" discussion with your customer. You'll work together to make reasonable estimates of workloads, come up with sensible SLAs, put measurement systems in place as above and be transparent about sharing the data. In 3-6 months, you will be in a better place to forecast, and to help the customer choose priorities.</p>

"Is it necessary to learn a technology in order to innovate using that technology?","61","","<p>I have observed different characteristics among famous tech CEOs. </p>

<p>Some of them never learnt the technology like Steve Jobs but knew very well how to use it to build innovative products.</p>

<p>Some learnt the technology well enough to develop ideas so that they could get those ideas implemented by people who had more expertise with that technology like Kevin Systrom (Instagram CEO).</p>

<p>So how do you figure out the power of a particular technology. Do you have to learn it to know its power? Do you have to understand it without learning it but how ? Or you get other people to explain it to you and be smart enough to kindle ideas yourself?</p>
","<p>My rule of thumb as a tech product manager is I need to know enough about every subject related to my product to be able to carry on an intelligent discussion about it, both with people who know more than me (my tech team and key customer experts) and people who know less than me (my sales and marketing teams and the overall customer base.) In other words, a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generalist</a>"".</p>

<p>Jobs may have needed Wozniak to create the first products, but I wouldn't assume he couldn't program or put together a computer.  However, the more important talent for Jobs was to recognize the talents of Wozniak and help to harness and leverage them.</p>

<p>So I'd say, yes, you do need to learn a technology in order to understand the implications of that technology, and ideally, generate insights that can led to useful and desirable innovation.  But the depth of your mastery of any given subject is related to your role in the project, and varies based on your individual function in the grand scheme.</p>

"Risks of Starting a Job Board?","61","","<p>I've been planning out a particular job board niche that from what it looks like no one is doing, but I want to understand the risks involved. I'm coming from a web developer background more then anything then from a law/management/accountant background.</p>

<p>I've been told I may have to worry about people getting hired through the website that are illegal(s) in the U.S. That may potentially have my site hit in court. I would assume in this case I would need to have a lawyer write a 'Terms of Service' that would hold up in court explaining the site isn't reliable for any loss or miss information entered by the employee/employer.</p>

<p>The site would only post jobs, let people apply, notify of openings, let employers review candidates, and perhaps add the ability for employers to send W2s, that would be it.</p>

<p>I want to be sure this project won't step on anyone's toe in the long run.</p>

<p>P.S I have a very good and stable understanding of security. i.e form sanitization, system administration (SSH/Firewall). Where I work now we get a lot of malicious attacks. I understand ID theft prevention, and database security will be a big play.</p>
","<p>I would not perceive your question to be a show stopper - I mean... you can resolve it, the bigger task ahead of you is to create the application. Do that, then worry about the legalities.</p>

<p>But... let's say you have your app created and you feel sure you'll get a few clients to use the site...</p>

<p>Small business don't start off with support from big accountants, lawyers and bankers. This is both your weakness and a strength. Courts for the most part work on ill intent. If a case was to go thru the courts, they would have to prove that you had ill intent and disregarded help/advice or purposely choose not to investigate due care and attention. Being a small business, it is unlikely (though not impossible) to find a judge who would throw the book at your genuine entrepreneur efforts.</p>

<p>You will not ever be 100% protected from another entity (company or person) from sueing you/your company. You can only go so far to protect yourself - it's a little like driving a car on the highway. Safety belts and airbags help many, but not everyone for every situation.</p>

<p>So... how to reduce those risks? </p>

<p>You don't have air bags or belts so closely inspect and do your best to create something similar. Research other services similar to yours, even if they are in a different industry. If your idea relates to something in manufacturing jobs, then try find a job site that exists within your state that deals with manufacturing. The similarity of ""blue colour"" labour job sites and ""white colour"" websites will help - their terms and conditions should help you lots. Your Terms &amp; Conditions (and possibly elsewhere on your app) should make clear that unless said otherwise, ""Applicants must be eligible to work in the specified location"" and that the app is acting solely as an agent introducing work seekers to recruiters and no offer of employment is promised.</p>

<p>Next - visit your local city hall and figure out if you need a license or not.</p>

<p>Review all this every six months too.</p>

<p>But... seriously... I would leave most of this paper chasing until you have a beta app. It will take you alot longer than you might think (I'm 95% finished an app I started 18months ago that I figured would take me six months to complete).</p>

Move to country that has less tax might be help in this case? or Should I also consider other factors?</p>
","<p>The only factor that counts is your local taxman.</p>

<p>And the only valid answer imho is: the country you're living in, unless you're an international team.</p>

<p>In practice, you'll get crucified by your taxman if you get caught, and caught you will get.</p>

<p>If your team is international, look into each founder's country. But go no further than that, because a nosy taxman <em>will</em> knock at your door one day and ask questions. While it might technically be legal and valid for an international team to incorporate in a tax haven, in practice the amount of overhead involved when the need arises to justify it for the various founders will simply not be worth it.

<p>What do you think how much a new user can cost?</p>
","<p>I have built massive followings (in the millions) through Facebook at no cost for different businesses I have owned in the past.  I have also been paid $1-3 per user acquisition to help others build their social media followings.  User acquisition for an app may be slightly higher since it takes a little more work than just having a user click like.  However, you should be able to get 100+ users in the first couple of days just through your own network for free.  Then ask 10 good friends to help you spread the word.  That should put you at a couple hundred followers.  Then I would imagine 5% may download the app (i'm just guessing).</p>

<p>However, the problem with Facebook is that not everyone is within your target audience.  Your best bet is to figure out who your target audience and then find forums with the hardcore users.  If it is a running app for example, then find every running forum and let people know about your app and possibly offer the paid version for free for a limited time to particular forums to get the buzz going.  This is how I have generated the best customer conversion rates and it really doesn't take that long.  So don't waste your time with Facebook in my opinion....go after your target audie</p>

<p>If we assume the round is larger in that the new investors are buying $200k worth of stock regardless of what you do, you'll need to match their contribution at that rate while keeping 10%.

","<p>I'm not sure we can really comfortably give you a 100% answer to this without knowing, well, everything about your existing situation. Forums are great, if you can say 'yes' to both of these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you have a lot of support tickets coming in? That's important both to keep fiscally responsible (a forum isn't free to maintain and if you can reply to an email a week and handle them all, that'll be cheaper) and to ensure that there will be an audience and community able to keep the forum afloat.</li>
<li>Could the types of support tickets you're getting be answered by members of the community?</li>
</ol>

<p>If both of those are affirmative to the point that you'd be saving money, that's great and you should go for it. It's probably also worth doing if you're steadily increasing the counts, and will soon be to that point.</p>

<p>You say this is for a hosting company, which is a little ambiguous. If we're talking about a ""we'll take care physically of your server"" company, then I'm not sure I can see there as being sufficient need for a forum. In that case, most questions would either be hardware-related, in which case they should be coming to you directly, or generically available software-related, in which case <a href=""http://serverfault.com"">Server Fault</a> is probably a better place for people to find answers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you're providing a proprietary software service on your own hardware (say, for instance, you're running a cloud storage site), and you get a lot of questions asking things like ""how do I add another user to my account so they can upload files?"" that seems like the kind of question that would be good for a forum.</p>

<p>Long story short, you just have to look at the data. Look back through your records and see what kinds of numbers you're getting, and what the nature is of your incoming tickets.</p>

<p>Remember also that a forum generally isn't substitute for live people responding to individual cases. Nobody is going to want to wait on your forum to respond to a sev-A server-down call. Having a forum <em>at best</em> means that you can reduce the number of support staff, which is great, but keep that in mind.</p>

<p>And if you do start a forum, make sure people are aware of liabilities. If they listen to some random member of the community and wind up destroying their database, you don't want to be at fault for that. That can be dealt with, of course, but make sure people are aware of who they're talking to, and that those people don't represent your company.</p>

  <h3>Can a Minor Form an LLC or Corporation?</h3>
  
  <p>All states require the principals of a company that incorporates to be 18 years or older. One option is to have a parent to act as an authorized signer – but remember, the parent becomes liable if their dependent is negligent in performing the duties of the business. [...] Another option, permissible in some states, is to have the minor become a shareholder. [...]</p>

<p>^ It eventually concludes by inviting you to consult a local attorney - which usually is a good idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Can a Minor Sign a Contract?</h3>
  
  <p>A minor can sign a contract, but in most states they are not considered legally competent to enter into a binding agreement, meaning they can disaffirm the contract – rendering it void.</p>

As I mentioned in the question below, I am not looking for research sources but rather a place where a person who is well versed in relevant law can specifically tell me what it is that I need to do. If this doesn't exist, then say so but please back it up with something more than ""I have never heard of something like that.""</p>

<hr>

<p>I am a computer programmer and I am interested in selling software online. If I begin doing so, I want to be very certain that all legal aspects of what I am doing are handled correctly. Unfortunately, I do not have thousands of dollars to spend on a lawyer. As governments generally want their laws followed, I imagine that they provide sources to find out what the laws are (as it is impossible to follow a law without knowing what it is (not that this is an excuse to break laws, but, it is a problem to be solved before going into business)). Am I correct about this? If so, where can I access such information for free? If I need to pay, the maximum I could afford is around US$100-$200 and I have many questions so I doubt that that would be sufficient to hire a good lawyer.</p>

<p>Some of the specific questions I have are (I am including these not to get answers for them from here, but, rather to give an idea of the sort of questions I have):</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I form a corporation (ie. LLC)?</li>
<li>How do I form a corporation without giving away my home address or spending money on an entirely unnecessary office space (I have heard a P.O. box is unacceptable for forming a corporation)?</li>
<li>Is a sole proprietorship sufficient?</li>
<li>How do I file taxes as a business?</li>
<li>Do I have sales tax obligations if I am selling internationally over the Internet (what about if someone in the same town as me buys the game)?</li>
<li>How do I properly shield myself from liability (even if I make a legitimate mistake and a customer isn't misusing the software)?</li>
<li>Since I am selling internationally, what obligations (if any) do I have under US export restrictions?</li>
<li>How can I prevent piracy of my software without spending (from what I have heard) millions of dollars on law suits?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have done a fair bit of research in the legal aspect of running a business (which is how I know I even need to consider some of the above questions), but, as with many things the saying ""You don't know what you don't know"" likely applies to law as much as anything else. Since it can go terribly wrong to break laws, I want to make sure that I get complete information from someone who knows the law well to prevent anything bad from happening. </p>

<p>NOTE: I am in the United States and I am interested in both U.S. law and international law as it applies to my selling the software to those in other countries.</p>
","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>As software developers, we sometimes have a hard time understanding how it's possible that topics as procedural and algorithmic in nature as law and tax are not readily and definitively outlined online. We have become comfortable with resources like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">StackOverflow</a> that seem to have the canonical answer to any software development question. In the unlikely scenario a programming topic has not yet been addressed, there is a massive community of experts at-the-ready, mouse pointers on the refresh button, tabs with standard library references open -- ready to do battle for an up-vote or two and that ever-elusive green-checkmark.</p>

<p>This is not so in the world of legal information.</p>

<p><strong>Access to Law in the United States</strong></p>

<p>In the United States, access to legal information is a racket (<a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/racket"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see definition 4</a>). The legal education market is controlled by the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AEA-2016-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Bar Association cartel</a> which restricts legal education to a select few, highly antiquated, and ridiculously expensive graduate programs they protect with <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=256740"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">barriers</a> that keep most from having any sort of legal education. If that were not enough, the economics of attending anything but one of the absolute <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school_rankings_in_the_United_States#Schools_that_rank_in_the_top_14_.28aka_.22T14.22.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">top law schools</a> are <a href=""http://outsidethelawschoolscam.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-four-tiers-t13-trap-no-name-and-joke.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">difficult to justify</a>. The inability of many law students to get a job upon graduation leaves many law school graduates doing <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704913304575371243914408322"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">something other than practicing law</a> and the few that do find work with much less competition.</p>

<p>Beyond the barriers to a legal education, there are even greater barriers to accessing the law. There are two companies that provide excellent access to statutes and case law: <a href=""http://www.lexisnexis.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LexisNexis</a> and <a href=""http://www.westlaw.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Westlaw</a>. (Yes, there are others, but none are as comprehensive.) Each of these companies will sell individual attorneys limited access to their databases (usually for the laws in one state) for around $500 per month (give or take $100 depending on how good the lawyer was at negotiating the agreement). Many lawyers get around these fees by using legal libraries often found at law schools. However, these libraries are almost always limited to lawyers, judges, and law students.</p>

<p>All jurisdictions (which are generally counties), have their own sets of case law. Some provide a crippled version for public access (usually through a contract with LexisNexis) which shows only the most basic meta information related to cases.</p>

<p>All law in the United States is in the public domain. One might therefore think this information would be easily accessible to the pubic. Unfortunately, it's not. Let's take, for example, the federal <a href=""https://www.pacer.gov/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PACER</a> public legal access system which allows anyone access to federal court documents for 10 cents per page (an absurd amount to pay for electronic documents). Some people worried about the lack of pulic access to law created <a href=""https://free.law/recap/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">browser plugins</a> that would automatically capture pages accessed using PACER into a publically accessible database. The courts have responded harshly to this plugin, <a href=""https://ecf.mad.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">forbidding its use</a> in some cases. Even the FBI <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2009/10/swartz-fbi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">got invovled</a> after <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aaron Swartz</a> (the founder of Reddit who commited suicide because of the actions of an <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/obama-wont-fire-aaron-swartzs-federal-prosecutors/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">overzealous federal prosecutor</a>) added 2.7 million pages (less than 1% of the PACER system) to the free archive. Again, we're talking about information in the public domain here. As <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2012/05/30/tear-down-this-paywall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reason eloquently put it</a>, we're dealing with a system and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_boy_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">old boys' club</a> ""as archaic as a barrister’s wig.""</p>

<p><strong>So Should Startups Just Give Up?</strong></p>

<p>No!</p>

</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, there is not much out there written in layman's terms beyond what Nolo publishes; there are a few, but not many.</p>

<p>If you want to go beyond what Nolo offers (short of going to law school), you can always search online for law school syllabi on particular topics. Those always have the texts used in a course which you can purchase (at a fair substantial cost as they are text books) and review.</p>

<p>If you want to go further, you'll have to consider law school. There are a few relatively inexpensive online law schools <a href=""http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Education/LegalEducation/LawSchools.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mostly in California</a> (which is the only state you'll be able to practice after being a student at one of these schools). I know of business people who enroll in <a href=""http://www.stfrancislaw.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">St Francis School of Law</a> (perhaps the best regarded of the non-ABA programs) because they want to understand law but do not want to be attorneys.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you have to go to an ABA-accredited law school. (As you may have guessed, they don't allow programs that are completely online.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyway, I hope this helps you to understand why it's not so easy to get access to legal information and why it's generally in people's best interests to hire a lawyer. Our society does not provide quality access to law and your options are either to invest your time heavily into studying the law or to hire an attorney.</p>

<p><strong><em>My best advice: Read the Nolo books and then consult with an attorney. You'll save a small fortune in consultation fees and you'll be a much smarter legal consumer.</em></strong> </p>

"Avoid alienating early adopters while iterating","59","","<p>Hypothetical situation: You release an MVP of a software product, and gain a few early adopters. Being an MVP, there are issues with your product that you quickly learn about so you plan changes or new features. As you continue to iterate, your product changes significantly.</p>

<p>Presumably most customers will be happy as the product is better, but some may be perfectly comfortable with the MVP workflow. Is this often an issue? If so, should one be more cautious with changes to the product (at the expense of the product's quality) or continue to make major changes to improve the product (at the expense of the customer base)? How does one find a balance?</p>
","<p>I generally wouldn't worry to much.</p>

<p>While it is true that <a href=""https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2012/07/16/googles-take-on-change-aversion-misses-the-point/"" rel=""nofollow"">customers hate changes that make them feel stupid</a> there is really no way to avoid making changes early in product discovery.</p>

<p>Remember that pivots happen around markets as well as product features. So one of the reasons that early customers may dislike change is that they're actually not in your market any more. </p>

<p>If losing those early customers is going to be too painful for the company, then that raises questions about whether the totally addressable market is large enough to sustain you in the longer term.</p>

<p>You're not (I assume) planning to make random changes. You're planning to make changes that address particular problems people have raised, or to validate new hypothesis you have formed about your product and market. In the former case customers should generally be happier that pain points disappear. In the latter you need to experiment to make progress.</p>

"How to charge for very small amounts of money? Like Adwords/AWS","59","","<p>For businesses like Google adwords or Amazon AWS, they charge users by the hour, or by the amount of views an ad receives. Sometimes this results in extremely fractional and small totals. (e.g. $0.00001) or something.</p>

<p>How do these businesses process these? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do they just let them sit there until they pass a certain threshold (thereby losing out on potentially a lot of money when these small amounts are aggregated over large number of accounts)</p></li>
<li><p>Do they just round them up to some sort of minimum?</p></li>
<li><p>Do they just process them as is and eat the cost of processing a $0.00001 bill?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Most companies in this pricing model will do one of two things: </p>

<ul>
<li>Charge up-front for a certain amount, say $10.  The customer's usage would eat into that amount until it's almost used up and then charge another $10 to the account automatically.</li>
<li>Take the card info but don't charge until the usage has hit a certain threshold, like $10, then charge for the total current usage at that time. It may exceed that threshold amount (e.g. $12.34 by the time the billing occurs).  </li>
</ul>

<p>I believe Amazon does the 2nd one.  </p>

<p>Charging for tiny amounts isn't worth it since even the most favorable card charging fees typically are at least 10 cents per charge, regardless of the amount (30 cents is by far the most common).</p>

"Sole incorporation and adding a cofounder as ""director"" versus cofounder","59","","<p>My cofounder and I have a time constraint on incorporating our company (we got into an accelerator program and have a week to get the legals done). For ""time's sake"" my cofounder wants to be the sole owner of the company until a lawyer can set-up the vesting agreement and share distribution.</p>

<p>He says that as soon as the lawyer gets back to us with the agreements, new company shares will be emitted (e.g. going from one share to ten), and my 40% will then be given along with a role as a director. He said that is exactly the same as being an actual co-founder.</p>

<p>I find this setup quite surprising: I would expect that a director with shares is still different, legally, from an actual co-founder. Should I feel wary about this scheme, or, on the contrary, is this a usual setup?</p>
","<p>There is no legal significance to the term ""co-founder.""  It only matters if you want to have that term be on your resume.  </p>

<p>People use the term ""co-founder"" quite loosely in that people who come on board significantly after founding are sometimes called co-founders.</p>

<p>You are present at the beginning so if you really want to be a cofounder you should discuss with your partner.  If he isn't willing to do that, then you should find out why and consider whether this is someone you want to be a co-founder with. </p>

Would all of our partners' software that can be seen in the final product count as a VAR?</p>
","<p>The full term is <strong>V</strong>alue <strong>A</strong>dded <strong>R</strong>eseller. Way back when, VAR was a term coined to distinguish resellers who added services to the product in question.

<p>That still exists in some markets, but very often it's the first level of accreditation - much as some interns get hired as VPs, but they still have making coffee for the team as the first part of their job description.</p>

"How can I predict the right number of trees to cut for next year's Christmas tree sales?","58","","<p>I'm thinking of starting a Christmas tree company (I'd be a middle-man between lots and consumers), and I'm trying to plan out my business for next year.</p>

<p>My question is likely--like many--much more easily asked than answered: how can I predict how many trees to cut?</p>

<p>I know this is a big question, and I'm not looking for an exact answer, but mostly I'm curious of what methods I can use to make good estimations. I know similar cases might happen in restaurants, or even perhaps some tech companies that pay for web hosting in advance.</p>

<p>If I take a guess at the answer, I'm thinking the best option would be some statistical analysis of the market (like how many people typically buy trees), but I'm not even sure what I would do with that number. I've thought about asking casually at lots or other resellers, but that seems awkward and potentially offensive (since resellers are my competition).</p>

<p>I don't want to undersell my business here, but ultimately I'm not sure how much value I'm bringing to the table that competitors aren't. I'm not dealing with a startup in the sense of going in on ground-breaking research that changes the world. But by the same token, I don't think my competitors have much advantage over me. It really just comes down to location, which is why I'm starting to wonder whether my best bet might be to look at the relationship of how many trees are sold annually in my area, as well as how much traffic the parking lot I'm looking to set up in actually gets. But are there other variables I should keep in mind?</p>
","<p>The main edge you have over your competitors is <em>flexibility</em>. As soon as you commit to an answer, you lose that edge, and you're left with the same variables as they have on which you have to execute better.</p>

<p>To apply some startup thinking, there are two main areas of opportunity. </p>

<p>First, <strong>can you sell</strong> (at least a proportion) <strong>before you have to fulfil</strong> the order? </p>

<p>Second, can you act in a way that will <strong>increase the total sale value to each consumer?</strong></p>

<p>Answering those questions is all about getting to know the market. If it were me, I would find what schemes apply locally for disposing of Christmas trees after the holidays, and ride their coat tails to make connections with potential consumers. </p>

<p>This isn't an exhaustive list, but just some thoughts to get you going, as you think about doing some customer development (i.e. engaging with real consumers and getting to know their problems). Consumers <em>might</em> value:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Selecting tree types and characteristics online</p></li>
<li><p>A service that delivers their tree and collects it for disposal</p></li>
<li><p>A range of stands to hire or buy</p></li>
<li><p>Themed decoration sets</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to gift a tree to someone</p></li>
<li><p>Being assured their purchase has a positive environmental consequence</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Right now you can be learning from the competition just by seeing how they describe, price, sell and package trees, what other products and services they offer and so on. You don't want to be constrained by what they are doing, but you can shortcircuit a lot of the work. Do ask questions. In busy times, you can ask simple questions that can be answered in one or two words: some sellers will just give you an answer, because that's easier than getting into conversation. In quiet times, you can strike up a conversation. Some people will open up a lot. If they don't, you've lost nothing. And get contact details: these people may be competitors, but they could be your customers, or they could be your channel.</p>

<p>At the end of all this, if you work hard, you could have a contact list of prospective customers, an idea of what might make a Christmas tree seller stand out from the crowd, and some first hand knowledge about what's easy that looks hard, and what's hard that looks easy. </p>

<p>At the end of that, you may just do what you already have in mind. Or you might find yourself mapping out very different paths. The good news is that industries untouched by innovation present great opportunities: your job is to find them, then position yourself <em>exactly</em> where you can take best advantage.</p>

"How can I secure my pumpkin patch in a cost-effective and inviting way?","58","","<p>I run a small pumpkin patch, but as the years go by and we begin to expand, I'm starting to find it difficult to keep up with security. We've had some trouble in the past with vandalism--nothing overly serious, but enough to cost me some money and make me fearful of what else could happen.</p>

<p>How can I secure the farm in such a way that I'll deter any unwanted visitors, but still not scare away potential business?</p>

<p>Obviously I could throw up electric fences with barbed wire, but that hardly fits with the lighthearted fun of picking up a pumpkin. The land is visible from one semi-busy road, so it's not overly secluded.</p>

<p>I generally hire a security company to watch over the place, but that's becoming less and less effective as my land coverage grows. I make enough to pay for the land and maintenance the pumpkins take, but for the eleven months out of the year that people more or less forget about pumpkins, it's hard for me to justify paying the fees of a team of security guards to keep things in order when I'm not around.</p>

<p>I've thought about installing security cameras, but I worry that those might be too much of an investment. And don't I still need someone there constantly monitoring them? I know lots of businesses use fake cameras, or a combination of fake and real ones, but how effective is that really? I've also heard that even just putting up a few cameras and a bunch of ""Secured by <em>[company]</em>"" signs can help significantly without incurring a ton of costs.</p>
","<p>Take software as an analogy. No amount of countermeasures or resisting it will put an end to piracy.</p>

<p>Once this ticks, you aim for a level that you find acceptably low, rather than aim for eliminating it entirely. You also aim to keep countermeasure costs in line with (and ideally lower than) the extra revenue you get by implementing them.</p>

<p>Consider approaching securing your pumpkin field in a similar manner. You'll always have some theft.</p>

<p>""Secured by [company]"" signs sound nice. So do ""Smile, you're being filmed!"" signs -- no need for any actual cameras anywhere, let alone real ones. Perhaps that will be enough to keep losses acceptably low most of the time? It's a very cheap and low risk investment, so certainly worth trying if it's in line with the losses you get while the security firm isn't around.</p>

<p>I've been working on other projects alone, and this is my first time going by a different way.</p>

  <p>If you both invest the <strong>same amount of time and money</strong> into the company then by logic you should <strong>split 50/50</strong>.</p>

<p>Also at this point you have nothing built yet so you're basically splitting an invisible pie, that is nothing. Same goes for your friend's talents. He didn't put any effort into the company yet, so by giving him 40% you're saying that whatever he'll do in the future, it will only worth 40%. So why should he put in 50% the time and money?</p>

<p>Think of it this way: Why does your friend want 50%? One possibility would be because he thinks that this is his company as well. He wants the company to succeed as much as you do, this is why he's willing to put in the same amount of time as you and this is why he feels that giving him 50% is justified. </p>

<p>Certainly I do not know what your friend thinks or wants, but I suggest that you talk to him about this, and about <strong>why he feels that he needs 50%?</strong></p>

<p>After that you will know with higher accuracy each site's expected installation time and that will let you plan installations better.

  - Is it a good approach to ask for a minimal salary<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> as funding for the product, during the initial development?</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<ol>
<li>The advisor/co-founder is starting in the niche in the following weeks and was interested in my overall look at the problems which am trying to solve and was willing to help with whatever he could, hence advisor.</li>
<li>Minimal as to cover my living costs initially after the product launches, shouldn't be more than a 6 months</li>
</ol>
","<p>Shortly - don't leave your job till you have secured yourself.</p>

<p>This is actually a very common problem among startup founders, and it is also a very common mistake by it's own merit - you should be able to sustain yourself independently of the project you are making. Yes, that means you will need to dedicate your evenings, mornings, nights and holidays to your startup - but if you quit your job and the project fails in its initial stages or your partner makes an unexpected exit - you will have no safety net whatsoever. </p>

<p>Of course you can ask your partner to finance the project and your work, this happens quite often if the partner has finance he is willing to invest. But again - secure yourself first. Maybe dedicating some free time at first is a good option. </p>

<p>Another one you should consider - maybe you can work part time at your day job and dedicate the other part to your project? Sometimes people even change jobs (even fields) to have less load and more free time. There are many options - however, relying solely on one source is not something you want to do. </p>

"When should I ask my customers for feedback?","58","","<p>With my local college tutoring business, we form short-term relationships with our customers (usually 1 or 2 semesters, then they don't need us anymore ;-) )  One of the problems I've had is deciding <strong>when and how</strong> to ask for feedback.  </p>

<p>I set up a <a href=""http://bloomingtontutors.com/feedback"" rel=""nofollow"">feedback page</a>, and of course we are on Yelp, Google+, etc.  But we get very little spontaneous feedback or reviews from customers.  We tried emailing customers last semester after midterms, explicitly asking them to leave feedback on our feedback page.  Unfortunately, we got a very low response rate (about 6%).  </p>

<p>The way I see it, I have a couple strategies for timing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask each client after their first session.  This might mesh well with the fact that customers are probably trying to decide how they feel about us immediately after the first session, rather than the 5th, 10th, or 20th.  On the other hand, one session is hardly a good ""sample size"" for someone to form an opinion.</li>
<li>Ask everyone after midterms (this didn't seem to work so well).</li>
<li>Ask everyone before finals (untested).  At this point, clients have had plenty of time to get to know us, but they haven't skipped town for winter/summer break.</li>
<li>Ask everyone after finals.  I strongly dislike this idea, because most clients will be eager to leave school and school-related things behind.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could also ask clients at multiple points in the semester, and perhaps set up something to automatically email them after the 1st, 5th, 10th sessions.  But, I don't want my customers to feel nagged.</p>

<p>How should I design my feedback-gathering strategy?</p>
","<p>First impressions count. They can make the difference between a client staying and saying nice things about you or not.</p>

<p>First encounters count too. They're a crucial moment to collect feedback because your client hasn't adjusted to your process and work habits yet. If there is one moment to collect interesting insights on the latter, this is it.</p>

<p>As such, ask feedback:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After their first session. Ask a short and open ended question: ""Was this useful for you? Is there anything we can improve?"" It's a sample of one session, but it's in fact quite important because it'll let you collect the information you need to better serve that particular client.</p></li>
<li><p>After their second session with a similar question (""Was this more useful than last time? Is there anything else we can improve?"") if the first one led you to make material adjustments. Rinse and repeat until your client expresses satisfaction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The next stage is collecting feedback after mid-terms. For this, run a survey using Google Forms or equivalent, explaining that you're looking for insights to serve clients even better. Keep it <strong><em>short</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The final stage is collecting testimonials after the finals. Contact clients <em>after</em> they received their results. Focus on those that got the most out of your service.</p>

<p>Don't source this last task to a soulless call center: the call should come from someone senior within the organization or from someone (e.g. tutor, administrative assistant) that the student knows already. Congratulate them on the phone, briefly ask what their plans are moving forward, and then ask if they'd recommend your service. Ask why not if they answer they wouldn't; prompt them to post a review on Yelp if they would.</p>

","<p>The simple solution would be to create a repayment agreement between yourself and your corporation for any personal money you spend on behalf of the corporation.  </p>

You pierce the veil when you fail to observe the organizational or record-keeping record-keeping requirements for a corporate entity, depending on the state you formed it in.  It could also be piercing the corporate veil if you treat the company's money as if it's yours for personal expenses, almost like a personal ""piggy bank"", but there is no rule of which I'm aware that says you are not allowed to pay corporate expenses with personal funds.</p>

<p>The best practice would be to draft an agreement to be repaid by the company for anything you personally spend, which will keep everything clean for your investors when you're ready to bring them in.</p>

"How do you evaluate key employee worth in small business sale? What is the appropriate terminology to describe this?","57","","<p>In a small small tech SaaS company with SDE around $120k, the owner is looking to sell and retire, but does not want sell to the only employee due to lack of up front capital.</p>

<p>The employee has been with the company 12+ years, and is the only individual with recent and extended knowledge of the program (inside and out), as well as customer support.  A ""hands off"" investor is interested in the purchase the company, and discussion occurs on placing the employee in charge of the full operations of the company, while the investors could merely reap the profits.</p>

<p>For the employee, they recognize their worth to the company.  They are under no legal or ethical obligation to stay with the company, and could find comparable or even better employment elsewhere.  Further, it stands to reason that without a knowledgeable and experienced employee, the final sale price of the company could be affected, perhaps severly, as it is a moderately sized software package and no one else has recent and detailed, long-term experience with it.</p>

<p>It is a niche market, relatively limited customer base, and is a many featured product that would take a while for even a customer to learn, let alone a new employee to both support and maintain.</p>

<p>For the employee, who has very little incentive to stay, how would the value of that employee be measured, from all three positions?  The seller, the buyer, and the employee?</p>

<p>While there are few incentives for an outside investor (they could find another company), what are the considerations for both the employee and the seller, how tondescribe this to both, and possibly ethical considerations involved.</p>

<p>Should the employee just walk away, or refuse a deal with the new owner, the investors would likely walk away, and finding new prospects would be harder (it has been on market for 2.5 years already, and the owner is 70).  If the employee stays, without demanding something in return for his 'expertise', he would feel disrespected by the owner who feels no loyalty to reward 12 years of service to profit the owner.</p>

<p>Since the only leverage the employee has is with the current owner in the sale, could/should he expect compensation as part of the deal from the exiting boss, perhaps to secure 2-3 years of labor with the buyers, so that everyone is benefitted? The employee would just as soon walk away and find new employment as stay with the company, and the employers fate is of no concern to him.</p>

<p>Should the employee expect anything from the seller, perhaps even a substantial percentage of the final sale price, such as, if the company is worth 50% less if he doesnt go with a sale, could/should he demand a sizable portion of the company sale price from the company owner in the sale agreement?  Is there better method of valuation for the employee, and how would one communicate this ethically and clearly?</p>

<p>NOTE:  I am mostly interested in the employees position, both in verbiage as well as ethically, but am interested in the others as well, if possible.</p>
","<p>I'll answer this from a few perspectives and make some assumptions as I go ... </p>

<p><strong>If I were the current owner</strong></p>

<p>I'm assuming that they want to extract some value for the business. A few ideas</p>

<ul>
<li>Engage the employee in a staged buy out of the company, maybe using part of their monthly salary to purchase a small number of shares each month. Once there is a changeover of majority control (50%) then the current owner will continue as shareholder and advisor until all the shares have been transferred. This gives a good possibility that the business will succeed (depending on the skills of the employee), as there will be skills and knowledge transfer over a number of years from the current owner to the employee. This only works if the current owner and the employee are getting a reasonable wage.</li>
<li>Find a new owner for the company, with an understanding that there would be a 10-20% stake that the employee would purchase over time. This might be good for the employee as then the skills base for the business would be broader making it have a higher chance of success.</li>
<li>It depends how keen you are to finish working in the business and if you would like to tail it off as a lifestyle business over a few years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If I were the employee</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>... and I was not wanting to run the whole business, I would be engaging with the current owner to help choose a new owner that I liked and thought I could work with, also asking for a share of the business to keep my loyalty</li>
<li>... and I was wanting to own/run the business, I would engage with the current owner on this basis, but find a friend/colleague who has run their won IT (preferably) business, and has different skills to me to go into partnership and purchase the business from the current owner. Looking for an 'investor' will mean you will lose control.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you are the investor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would want to incentivise the employee to stay around and invest further in the busienss. Assuming you like/trust them, I would go for allowing the employee to have some equity.</li>
<li>You could purchase the business, keep the employee on just as an employee (with the risk that they might leave) and engage with a few of the largest customers to understand the business model of the SaaS system to then bring in your own analyst/programmers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure which of the three the OP is ... but transition planning is always a tricky thing. I have had friends who have tried doing it and the biggest problem is finding the right person to pass the business onto, in order that the business is most likely to succeed.</p>

","<p>TL; DR: Other factors affect shipping cost like  value, fragility and stack ability.</p>

<p>Other factors in addition to <strong><em>weight</em></strong> and <strong><em>volume</em></strong> must be taken into account when calculating shipping costs.</p>

<p>Among these are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How <strong><em>valuable</em></strong> is the item?</li>
<li>How <strong><em>fragile</em></strong> is the item?
And (more particular to this situation)...</li>
<li>How <strong><em>stackable</em></strong> is the item?</li>
</ul>

<p>More fragile and more valuable items cost more to ship because the shipper bears the risk of loss or damage during transport.</p>

<p>Items that are more difficult to <strong><em>stack</em></strong> on top of each other (as in the case of the chair, (presumably because of the ""fixed leg"" geometry) increase an items shipping costs because it limits the amount of goods that can be carried on the truck the item is shipped in. Thus increasing the total cost of the shipment per dollar of revenue. This increased total shipping cost must then be allocated favorably items that are more stackable and less favorably to items that are less stackable.</p>

<p>In this case, when the item is shipped in a 24"" cube package, the cost of increased volume of packing materials must also be factored in.</p>

We do purchase commercial things, of course, especially when they are industry standards.  How does a startup convince someone in this industry that something is worth paying for?</p>
","<p>You need to figure out and learn to emphasize the benefits you're offering. People don't usually buy features or information; rather, they buy benefits, answers, and solutions. In case it applies to you - and it probably does, based on your question - they also buy thrills.</p>

<p>Assuming this is some kind of course aid, consider communicating on two things: that the product benefits them in some way, <em>and</em> that they get to experience rolling out the product in their own way. For the latter purpose, include milestones, checklists, perhaps even alternatives to explore, etc. so they can do it themselves within the framework that you're putting forward (""have I done it right?"").</p>

<p>Another consideration for you should be finding the right words for all stakeholders. Intuitively, you need to convince several sets of people when selling a product in academia: the actual end-users, i.e. the teachers, but also those who oversee what they do (the department head?), those who pull out the checkbook (the intendant?), and perhaps even the students themselves.</p>

"How to predict deadline with high accuracy?","56","","<p>Meeting deadlines can be hard. And the reason for it being hard is that we either overestimate or underestimate the time required to deliver a product or service during pre-order. So how do start-ups actually predict perfectly when is the right time to set a deadline?</p>
","<p>I agree with my peers up here that, Startups probably never meet their deadlines because of unforeseen events that always happen. That being said here's the technique I use to try to be as precise as possible.</p>

<p>Break down the whole process from A to Z into steps you have to achieve.</p>

<p>Like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a Business Plan</li>
<li>Submit for financing</li>
<li>Recruit team</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then break these steps into smaller steps...</p>

<p>Submit for financing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a list of all the potential Venture Capital firms</li>
<li>Prepare paperwork to submit</li>
<li>Follow up</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then put it all in an Excel Spreadsheet with clear sections and sub-sections. and then try to evaluate as much as possible the time it will take to accomplish every single step on your plan. put a time frame next to every small task you put on it. Then add a completion date right next to the time you plan it will take to accomplish each task.</p>

<p>Add the timeframe column and you should have a pretty good idea when your deadline will be.</p>

<p>As you go trough your launch, you can check if you are meeting the small deadlines one by one on your plan, and it will let you know if you are on track, or if you are late on your program!</p>

"What are the benefits of mobile ads?","56","","<p>I manage a small hotel and often companies we advertise with online (e.g. Adwords, and online travel agents such as Expedia, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, etc.) give you the ability to set a different cost per click or a lower booking rate for people browsing their sites on mobile devices.</p>

<p>I have never understood how this can actually benefit a business. It doesn't matter to me if someone completes a sale using a desktop, laptop, cell phone or smoke signals. What matters at the end of the day is the sale. So:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why is there a trend in online advertising to give lower/preferred rates to people browsing their sites on a mobile device? Do people who browse on their mobile typically close the deal more than people browsing with a desktop?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this actually something that businesses could benefit from? Or is it just a marketing ploy created by advertising providers to ultimately make them more money, but really does not affect the company advertising with them very much?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>First off a life anecdote. Back when there was no mobile internet, I had a meeting that went on for much longer than planned. I decided to sleep at a hotel instead of driving 3h to get home. But the city was holding a major event and all hotels were... booked.</p>

<p>I was a <strong>desperate buyer</strong> that evening. I had no internet access for my laptop, and I'd have been fine with just about any place to get some sleep. With a smartphone and your mobile ad I'd have found your hotel in no time. In contrast, I'd have ignored your ad the day before had I seen it on my Desktop while planning my trip. Mobile ads are useful indeed.</p>

<p>A related point is specific to the hospitality business: if you don't rent your hotel room tonight, you cannot rent it tomorrow. It's gone forever, because you cannot stock it. As such, you're better off getting a client at a discount than no client at all so long as it covers your costs plus some.</p>

<p>Savvy travelers, rare as they are, know this. You'll always find a place that will let you stay with a large discount if you show up at 10pm and ask for one -- so why book in advance? It does introduce the problem of knowing where the hotels are, however. And that gets us back to the previous anecdote and the case for mobile ads. I wouldn't book online (since I cannot negotiate your price down on the site) but I'd call or show up at your door if I run into your ad.</p>

<p>My point in both cases is that <strong>mobile ads are more likely to get served in the right context</strong> -- and that's their main benefit. The only way for you to know how much better they perform in your case is to try both out and measure which ads convert best.</p>

<p>I'd stress a last benefit in conclusion: there's less fraud in mobile advertising. On desktop, affiliate fraudsters use adware and low quality traffic to <a href=""http://blog.enbrite.ly/?p=13"" rel=""nofollow"">pocket ill-earned commissions on travel sites</a>. They do this by using popovers or invisible browser windows to squeeze themselves between buyers and travel sites as users browse the travel sites. Or by cookie stuffing cheap traffic from porn and torrent sites. And that's just two of <a href=""http://blog.enbrite.ly/?p=102"" rel=""nofollow"">many other types of malpractices</a>. (Disclaimer: the two links go to a client's site. They're into fraud detection.) You see a lot less of those dirty tricks on mobile (at least for now), so your traffic quality may be better with mobile ads.</p>

If it doesn't work out or you don't like the uncertainty you can always switch to something a little more corporate.</p>

"Why do/don't brands allow their apparels to be sold as seconds quality? What precautions should one take before getting into a seconds business?","56","","<p>There are certain clothing brands which can be found in the seconds market while other are not. </p>

<p>What are the reasons, brands do this?
This is largely an unorganized sector. If one is planning to get into this field/ making this organized, what are the different factors should one look at? What could be the risks? How would one know if it is even legal?</p>
","<p>That is called price differentiation or price discrimination. Those are pricing strategies, which mainly focus on the willingness pay. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"" rel=""nofollow"">Read this wikipedia article for the theoretical background.</a> </p>

<p>There are many differences a product can have form another. Mostly it is just the name or the brand which is changed. (e.g. washing powder, food industry, juweliers, car industry etc.) And sometimes there is no difference at all, it is just the place or the distribution, which allows the the price differentiation (e.g. vaccines in the US and vaccines in Africa). Of course other things, like quality play a role too.</p>

<p>What is the reason, brands do this?</p>

<p>The main goal is to reach customers, you can't reach with your product. This will <strong>Maximize your Earnings and/or prevent competitors to enter your market</strong>.</p>

<p>In your special case, you focus on a brand strategy. Differentiation by Marketing. Think about it: There are people paying a lot of money to get the most newest, awesome, best shoes, just because the commercials tell them: ""Those are way better, then the old one"". Then there are people, which may look at quality, they don't buy the newest things, but they may buy an older version and not the cheapest. Maybe there are some other groups you want to reach, like ""cheapest first"", ""ecological awareness"" etc.</p>

<p>All those are only reachable by different products. Of course this only makes sense, if you the opportunity costs are lower then the gained benefit.</p>

<p>What factors?</p>

<p>Well you see, I listed many things already. So without information about you, your product and your goals, it is quite hard to give advice here.</p>

<p>Overall you have to think about these things: What is the customer segment of the ""old"" and the ""new"" product? What are there differences? Is the difference large enough, so your products don't excessively substitute each other?</p>

<p>Risks?</p>

<p>Same as previous, without further information its quite hard to tell. An awesome example is Harley Davidson. They had the problem with thier image. The ""biker area"" was over, so they tried to extent there product to younger customer groups. Not sure, if it was the marketing message or budget, but in the end, no one bought Harley Machines no more, because, for young people the brand was still not interesting and the rockers felt betrayed by their brand... But in the end, Harley did a great job. It was learning by doing.</p>

<p>I think the main risks are, 
- that your customer groups collide in any way.
- the opportunity costs out weight the benefits. (it is a lot of additional work)
- underestimation, path dependencies and wrong structure, while planing and executing</p>

<p>Legal?</p>

<p>In Germany there is the Cartel Office, which prevents artificial monopolies. But if you want such a thing to be illegal you really need market power (E-Bay and PayPal)</p>

<p>Of course, you can only do that with your own brands and products. You can't just make adidas shoes and say, ""oh sorry, I just wanted to sell the to an other customer audience"".</p>

<p>But, if you can offer adidas something, like an already existing distribution network, in an country, where adidas doesn't exists. That would be some kind of licencing strategy.</p>

<p>Does that answer this point?</p>

<p>Minimum price guaranteed: You won't get a lower price by going direct!</p>

<p>Let's imagine one product is priced at $40, and it isn't available for less on the vendor's own site. We take 30%, which is $12. So the product vendor gets $28 net. </p>

<p>If they want to make sure they always get at least $40, they might decide to tell us that their best price is $60, when it's actually on sale at $40. </p>

<p>How can we control this, so that we can genuinely offer products ""minimum price guaranteed""?</p>
","<p>If you offer a specific best price promise, you're going to have to honour it. Which almost certainly means you need an agreement with the product vendor to cover you, if they tell you a price above the true minimum, or if they reduce their price on their own site.</p>

<p>If you're really well established, then you can insist on the terms and conditions that cover you. But as a startup, that could be tricky.</p>

<p>I'm aware of a number of sites that do the job you describe, only with two different strategies.</p>

<p>There are sites that aren't making individual agreements, but are either making use of the product vendors' affiliate schemes, or else are working through intermediaries who connect each vendor to many consumer deal sites.</p>

<p>If that's what you have in mind, then you need to examine the Ts &amp; Cs carefully, and try and make sure that you have 100% back-to-back cover. If their Ts &amp; Cs leave you with a financial or reputation risk, you need to make a different promise.</p>

<p>Then there are sites that use very similar language, but limit the promise - for instance, basing the offer on prices as checked on a particular date.</p>

<p>If that's a way you'd like to go, I would strongly suggest getting legal advice, because some jurisdictions restrict the use of specific terms. If that's the case, your small print may have no legal force, and because your supplier wasn't making a matching commitment, you wouldn't be protected.</p>

<p>36 opens (36% open rate). 18 clicks. 13 people signed up from older mailing list. 1 engaged.</p>

<p>21 opens (50% open rate). 11 clicks. 8 people signed up from latest mailing list. 4 engaged.</p>

<p>However, even the engagement was short lasting, after they created some jobs, they stopped. What is my next move here? I already emailed them to see if they need any help. Am I approaching this problem right?</p>
","<p>I don't understand your numbers, do you have 2 different mailing lists? </p>

<p>The first sentence says:</p>

<ul>
<li>36 opens (36% open rate) so that means you sent the email to 100
people.  </li>
<li>21 opens (50% open rate) so that means you sent the email to 42
people.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first blast, you got 1 person to engaged (whatever engagement is for you) with your app out of 36 who read your email. </p>

<p><code>Engagement Rate = 2%.</code></p>

<p>Now apparently, either your leads in the second list are warmer, or you did a better job because out of 21 people 4 engaged.</p>

<p><code>Engagement Rate = 19%</code></p>

<p>am I correct? </p>

<p>Anyways, </p>

<p>There are 2 ways you can grow the engagement on your app:</p>

<p><strong>1. Get more people into your funnel</strong></p>

<p>Your second list has a 20% engagement rate, that's pretty cool. If you get 100 people into that funnel, you can project that you are expecting to see at least 20 engagements on your app every time you send an email. So the more people goes through your funnel, the more engagements you're going to get. </p>

<p><strong>2. Increase the engagements per user</strong></p>

<p>Say it's pretty hard for you to put more people into your funnel. Is it all lost? No! you have to make your users engage more frequently, thus your engagement rate will increase.</p>

<p>Reach out to the people who engaged with your app, say a week after they did, and ask them to do it again. If your app offers a benefit, tell them things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We've observed if you do X at least twice a week, your results tend to
  go up by Z% It's been X days since you did Y.  <strong>DO X NOW BY CLICKING
  HERE</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, try reaching out to the people <strong>who did not open</strong> your email in the first blast with the messaging you used with the people in the second one, and see how they react. Probably you're going to get a couple more people to engage with your app.</p>

<p>Also, when sending out the email, Don't worry about times of day or day of the week kind of things. It doesn't matter at your volume. You're not going to get any statistical significance to draw any conclusion about your audience. It's just not worth it. Type up your email, proof-read it twice, have other people to read it, and then hit send whenever it's ready.</p>

<p>You can try to use some <a href=""http://customer.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">behavioral analytics software</a> to figure out what your users are doing. For example, a well known metric in the video games industry is the Exit Event Distribution. It's used to determine what things led a gamer to abandon their gaming experience. Then see if there's a problem, fix it and extend the playing time a couple of minutes or an hour. I strongly recommend you the book ""<a href=""http://amzn.to/1p2u4Fg"" rel=""nofollow"">For the Win: How Game thinking can revolutionize your business</a>"" It contains strategies to increase things like engagement.

<p>(Please note that if you haven't sourced at least 2000 hours in a way that relates to this answer, then it very possible you lack the experience to provide advice of this topic.)</p>
","<p>Hire them on a (sub)-contract basis. You'll need either a combined agreement or to use a few agreements:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IP Assignment:</em> The Harvard Business School has a very good <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurship/pdf/IP%20Assignment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">example of this</a>. You'll likely want to edit it for your situation. There are definitely others around to look at as well. </li>
<li><em>NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement):</em> Because there is a good chance that you'll be exchanging priviledged information you will definitely need one. There are <strong>many</strong> free samples available - for example <a href=""http://www.ndasforfree.com/NDAS/GetEmployee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this NDA</a> (for that one you'd want to replace all references from Employee to Contractor). </li>
<li>Contract Agreement: Spells out everything else (and may include those two above integrated in or as addendums). Things you'll want to make sure to include on this:
<ul>
<li>Rate (either fixed rate per project or hourly)</li>
<li>What extras they will charge (ie do they charge (sales) taxes)</li>
<li>Insurance: Make it clearly explicit that they are responsible for any insurance requirements in their jurisdiction/course of business.</li>
<li>What both of your responsibilities are (ie notice etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a fairly complicated agreement/collection of agreements; most people should at least have a lawyer review their proposed agreements (cheaper) or have a lawyer draw up the agreement. Even with an agreement in <em>some</em> jurisdictions you may be liable for insurance or other requirements; for example for <em>construction</em> (due to being a <strong>high</strong> risk industry) work in British Colombia (Canada) if you are subcontracting you are required to ensure that your subs are paying Workers Compensation or pay Workers Compensation yourself and deduct it from their pay. Most provinces/states have a business information service that can give you basic information like that for free as is relevant to your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In terms of payroll type taxes you have no liability as long as it is explicitly stated in your agreement that they are working on a <em>contract-basis</em> and for good measure add in something like ""the contractor is responsible for all taxes on the income from this contract"".</p>

<p>Another option is to go through a freelancer agency (or similar) that you pay the agency and they <em>may</em> already have a pretty good contract.</p>

<p>I am thinking to work part time for startup. I am finding it harder to code since i am thinking that i am coding same things again and again, why can't i automate it? And this thought is stopping me from coding. </p>

<p>Whats the way out to at least complete the startup product ? </p>
","<p>How many users said that they want to use your product? If 9 out of 10 people tell you they don't want to use your product then you probably shouldn't build it. </p>

<p>There are several SDKs/APIs/Frameworks available for chat (Layer Chat). This will not help you however. You probably don't even need chat. You need to verify that people want your idea. Not your friends and family but <strong>real</strong> business owners. </p>

<p>I'm a developer so I can give you advice from first hand experience. Once there is a chat, and a bunch of other cool things + 3 users, people will demand new things. Software development requires <em>constant</em> iteration. User feedback, testing, bugs, etc. Software is a never ending cycle. Software is never finished. So building the first version won't get you very far. </p>

<p>Also, think about how many business do exactly what you want to do. Facebook (in some way does that), LinkedIn (relatively directly does that), ProductHunt (indirectly does that), Twitter (indirectly), etc. Even though they don't do exactly that, they do do that. Even email does that. </p>

<p>I'm not trying to crush your idea. The point I'm trying to make is you really have to break down the idea, the product fit/market fit and a lot of other relevant things. Fill this out: <a href=""http://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/</a></p>

<p>I'm a full blown entrepreneur so I'm <strong>totally</strong> for the ""screw working for someone and do your own thing"". You SHOULD start your own business, and you SHOULD do this idea. You SHOULD build your own products, change the world and preferably never work for anyone. But software isn't always the best solution. </p>

<p><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO</strong></p>

<p><strong>VERIFY THE IDEA</strong></p>

<p>Why not create a consulting firm where you introduce businesses and then let them communicate however they want? Go to shops all over your city/town, get business's contact information and ask them what would help improve their business. Then, run around to other companies that can help these other companies business improve. Introduce them. After introducing 10 business that do business, start charging $100 per introduction. But don't charge the first 10. Build a reputation. And when you do introduce the first 10, they'll speak about you. They'll say: ""Samo's Consulting helped me improve my business by 15%."" And they'll recommend you to others. </p>

<p><strong>LEARN A SKILL</strong>  </p>

<p>I started coding because I had a ton of ideas as well. But I took it step by step. Ideas come and go, but skills stay forever. Learn how to code for the sake of the skill and not just for an idea. Skills are the only thing that'll keep you free. Whether it's speaking to people or coding. </p>

<p>Seeds you plant today grow into trees in 10 years. </p>

"Can a startup in one country employ remote workers living in another?","54","","<p>I am from Portugal (resident in Portugal ). I would like to know if a company based in Germany can employ people from Portugal for remote work in their country. (Both Portugal and Germany are in Europe.)</p>

<p>Broadly, can a company based in one Europe state member, employ people in another Europe state member?</p>

<p>If yes, where are tax and social/health insurance paid - in the country where the employee is based, or where the company is based?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Short answer is - it depends. </p>

<p>As a <em>natural person</em>, taxes on your income and social security must be paid in place of residence for tax purposes. As you indicated in your question, place of residence for tax purposes for you is Portugal.</p>

<p>For the German company, incorporated and operating in Germany, tax residence is Germany. Therefore, the German company can not directly pay taxes for you in Portugal, as it simply does not exist in Portugal for the tax purposes - it does not have fiscal identification number (identificação fiscal) and is not incorporated, nor has a branch in Portugal.</p>

<p>That, however, does not prevent the German company for employing you as natural person.</p>

<p>If you live in one EU country and work there for a company based in another EU country you will normally, under most tax treaties, be subject to tax only in your country of residence. However, to the specific case of Portugal and Germany, you might want to check with Portuguese tax office and have the German company do the same.</p>

<p>The easiest option, however, is to become self-employed (autônomo) in Portugal and work for the German company on contract basis. You will need to file and pay your own taxes, but it will probably be infinitely more easier than navigating the labyrinth of cross border employment laws and double-taxation treaties.</p>

<p>At an initial stage it is a technicality that you can put to one side and focus more on your MVP, raising investment, making your first sale etc.</p>

<p>after that your lawyer should be able to guide you through a process of creating an option pool which is tax efficient and which criteria employees need to meet in order to be included in it. Different countries have different employee pool schemes (see EMI Scheme in the UK)</p>

<p>If you wait until investment then you can negotiate with your investors over the size of the option pool and in what way it dilutes.</p>

<p>So, for example after our 2nd round of investment when we had our initial team together we put in place a 10% option pool (created after the completion of the round, as part of the cost of the round negotiated with the lawyer) under the EMI scheme.
Different investors may have different preferences over how you reward your employees and the size of the pool. It can become a negotiate tool later on. So, personally I'd put it out of my mind until it is necessary</p>

","<p>I think it comes down to the education level of the customer.  Some customers see anything that isn't running inside their data as being the same thing as salesforce.  In reality we know that there are very clear distinctions between the different tiers.</p>

<p>The fundamentals that concern well versed customers are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the application Multi-Tenant? I.e. is my data going to be merged
with other customers data?  From a security point of view, what are
my risks of disclosing my data to another party if there is a glitch
in the system.  </li>
<li>What are the options/implications of customization? 
If this is just another copy of the software running stand alone, do
I have complete decision making in how the application is
configured, and can I write custom code/integrations if need be.  This 
also affects your ugprade path.  If you are constantly having to remerge 
your configurations and customization back in with every release, that has 
tangible impact in terms of labor for the customer.</li>
<li>How does it scale? This affects both pricing and platform capability. 
If I go from x number of users to 5x, is it as simple as paying for
more seats? Am I going to have to pay for some sort of migration to
a different instance? In a true SaaS environment everything should
be linear and upgrades should be almost magical.  In a hosted
solution model, if you scale up dramatically you might have to
switch to different hardware.</li>

<p>The company provided an employment contract to sign. This contract includes a salary that, while not so big, would be acceptable. However I have doubts about the company's ability to pay the promised salary (too small, too early, obviously not making any money now). I know some money are required to register the company (they are AG), but I am not sure if the company should keep this money after registration or can simply spend and then have no any. </p>

<p>In order to quit my current job, I would like more additional security. Is it appropriate to ask them to show the bank statement of the company's account, or other similar documents proving there are money for my salary available? </p>
","<p>If the company has given you a valid employment contract with a salary, then they intend to pay you that salary.</p>

<p>Most startups work from investment funds and ""burn"" through them to pay for things such as employee salaries.</p>

<p>Assuming you are not subject to some kind of scam (and I see no indications that you are), and then you should expect the salary as arranged. It is written in a legal document, and that is about as much assurance as you can get.</p>

<p>If you join, you should treat postponement or partial payment of your regular salary payments as a warning signal that something is wrong, although sometimes that might be an honest problem or mistake if e.g. for only a week due to changing payroll provider.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to quit my current job, I would like more additional security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much security? Joining a startup is more risky than joining an established company, you trade long-term security for possibility of better rewards later (maybe in the form of rapid promotion, maybe in the form of a share options scheme)</p>

<p>Most startups fail. It is entirely possible that you will work this job for 6 months or a year and the company will fail to meet enough of its goals to be seen as viable for further investment. In which case you would still be paid for that time, but could lose your job.</p>

<p>A worst case scenario is that the company goes bankrupt whilst owing you some wages. That can happen, although a good company would warn you it is a possibility, if investment runs out but there's a slim chance of making through a month if only some particular order comes through. Good companies will also prioritise paying employees above other financial obligations. One way to mitigate a possible loss there is to not allow any missing pay situation to extend for a long time on a promise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it appropriate to ask them to show the bank statement of the company's account, or other similar documents proving there are money for my salary available?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No this is not appropriate, and will come across as rude and confrontational, unless you are joining as a founding member or investing in the company. If you are a founder, then you should be involved in discussions of how finance is managed, and will want to track it. Investors also will expect and get privileged access to company finance information. </p>

<p>Assuming you are an early stage salaried employee, normally a well-managed start-up will share <em>some</em>, more limited but still interesting financial metrics with you, perhaps in routine team meetings. In startups I have worked it was a routine to see monthly, quarterly revenue, year-on-year growth, the sales pipeline, the current burn rate etc. It is that kind of information that the company could share with you.</p>

<p>Instead of asking for documented proof of funds, maybe ask how much ""runway"" the company has (how long they predict to remain in business at current rates of loss), and how they are approaching investment. They might give you information such as they are looking for ""Series A"" investment or have Kickstarter funding, or something else - you can look these terms up, and get a feel for how well set the company is financially, at least for the short term. Also, you could ask if they have any presentation about business status that they share with employees that you could see (they might want you to sign an NDA to see this).</p>

Usually, when we do something like this, we look for complementary skills - if I am a programmer, I'll look for a business developer or designer, for example. But we know that it is quite hard to determine a person's capability (specially over internet, as CFL has people from all over the world). What can I do to assure that I am getting a person who is trully capable of doing what he/she says is capable of, and how can I protect the startup against a person who finds out not being a good fit for the company, taking in consideration that the person will usually get some participation on the company? I don't want to give away a share of the idea for a person who participated on it for only a short period of time before being removed.</p>
","<p>This has a <em>lot</em> of possible methods. Of course different positions have different capabilities and some are easier to test than others. A quick run-down of some testing/determination methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>can they show past work?</em> If yes, take a look at it and determine what you think of it. If you don't have the skills to do that (ie it is program and you don't know programming), do you have a friend who would be willing to look at it for you? </li>
<li><em>Do you they have some form of schooling?</em> This is a very debatable metric; some of the best designers I've known have had minimal formal schooling and some of the worst that I've seen have (ie some of those photoshop goofs in advertising). However it can at least show some dedication if it is a long course of study.</li>
<li><em>References:</em> Can give a good idea on the person's skills/reliability etc but you have to take what they with a grain of salt.</li>
<li><em>Testing:</em> Can be fun but hard to do for some things:
<ul>
<li>Programmers: get them to whip up a tiny program fast and try it out. - screen share is cool to see them at work though some people hate to work while watched and this may actually decrease their effectiveness.</li>
<li>Designers: get them to whip up a graphic fast  and see how it looks. Same thing about screen sharing, as programmers.</li>
<li>A lot of other specialities can follow those examples.</li>
<li>Managers, marketers etc: a lot harder to test in a quick and non-committing manner. In fact I'm not sure on good quick tests for them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>However good your testing/determination metrics are you won't always be right (if you do it enough times anyways) and you'll have to accept that as a cost of doing business. Basically consider it first as though you were hiring an employee to do that task; if you would hire them then consider whether they have that extra - extra responsibility, reliability, go-getter, good communication, willingness to work hard through rough patches etc. </p>

Especially since we have nothing other than an idea at this time that we are trying to sell and we ourselves have never seen it work?</p>

<p>What does everyone do?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>In all likelihood you'd incorporate with limited liability so technically your problems end with the company's failure. However, empirically you'd take a hit to your reputation (though in some cultures failure is seen as educational).</p>

"Facebook balance sheet, 2010-2011 7B cash increase, 17b net goodwill increase","52","","<p><a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb/financials/balance-sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb/financials/balance-sheet</a></p>

<p>As you can see, in 2011, Facebook reports that it has 8.97B in cash from 1.79. During this time, it did not raise anywhere near 7.2B (atleast as publicly reported and/or recorded on crunchbase). </p>

<p>In addition, in 2014, they record a Net Goodwill of ~18b. </p>

<p>The questions are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Where did they accumulate 7B cash? Eg, must they have raised cash or are there ways to come up with this number with creative accounting/liquidation of assets that perhaps I am not seeing? In a practical sense, were there some events that occured that were not publicly recorded? By 2007, Facebook was well on it's way to being a market force in it's sector, having raised from Microsoft and having mindshare with developers. </li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps they acquired a corporation with significant cash assets. </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Their total balance sheet equity value is far from their market cap? Is the net goodwill what they are using bring those numbers closer? Why is that relevant and is there any methodology to assignng that number? Presumably, it is a relatively arbitrary number but they have leeway with it considering their public market cap. </li>
<li>Perhaps the net goodwill they are using to assign value to the WhatsApp acquisition. </li>
</ol>
","<p>The increase in cash is from Facebook's public offering.</p>

<p>You noted on the balance sheet you linked to on MarketWatch that it says went from 1.79B in cash in 2010 to 8.79B in 2011. In the shareholder's equity section of that same balance sheet, Common Equity goes from 2.16B to 12.35B. That's the money raised by Facebook by selling shares.</p>

<p>However, the strange thing is that Facebook went public in May 2012, so none of this should be reflected in 2011. It looks like there is something wrong with MarketWatch's data because when you look at the same balance sheet on Google Finance, you see different numbers (see here: <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:FB&amp;fstype=ii"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:FB&amp;fstype=ii</a>). The numbers on Google Finance are more consistent with what you'd expect given the timing of Facebook's public offering.</p>

"How to build team for one person company?","52","","<p>I have formed a one person company. I don't have money to pay salary and I can't offer equity since I am director of company and I own all shares as its opc. How can I build team? </p>
","<p>You cannot hire without paying, of course, but your opc can still work with other businesses. The contract governing your relationship would specify the responsibility of all parties and the distribution of revenue or profits.</p>

<p>If for example, you are the one selling to customers, the contract might specify your commission. If you are doing accounting, it might specify hourly rates. </p>

<p>However the responsibilities are split, the one being paid by the customers, would need to pay those supplying the services that helped him get to that money.</p>

<p>So the other members of your ""team"" are really part of your supply chain either as your customers or as your suppliers.</p>

"How to File Quarterly Taxes for Single Member LLC","52","","<p>I'm a complete beginner. Just formed my first (single member) LLC. </p>

<p>Now, I am reading that quarterly estimated taxes are due, but I have absolutely no clue how to estimate my taxes or file with the IRS. Can someone please help with the ""for dummies"" version of this process!</p>

<p>I file my personal taxes annually through TurboTax.<br /> 
That's all I know.</p>
","<p>Basically it works out to dividing your expected taxes for the year by 4 and paying that amount at the end of the quarter. </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">1040-ES</a> has a section on how to figure out your taxes. The simplest way is to take your taxes that you did last year, assuming you make the same this year, and dividing that out. </p>

<p>You can still do your taxes annually but you will have to pay interest on the taxes that you didn't pay throughout the year. I know some people who do that because they can get short term investments that are more than the interest rate so they end up netting a little bit holding on to it and paying the interest.</p>

"How to sell a website and what are the services included with it?","52","","<p>I've recently started a business in IT solutions and one of the main services are website development for local businesses. They are either normal websites with no functionalities and only information, or E-Commerce websites.</p>

<p>I myself am a web developer, yet I am not entirely sure about the process of selling a website.</p>

<p>What are the techniques to selling a website? <br />
What are the necessary services that should be provided?<br /> 
Should I provide a cheaper cost for a poorly designed website?</p>
","<p>I've worked in this field for quite a while, and it's not just about writing code, let me tell you.  To be successful, you have to understand what your customers' needs are.  It sounds simple until you realize that many times the customers themselves aren't totally sure of what they want!  They may have some fuzzy ideas about what a website would be or could do for them, but most of the time they don't have enough understanding of what is and isn't possible in technology to have a realistic idea of what they can have.</p>

<p>The point is, most of the time the customer will look to you to understand their business and their market enough so that you can figure out what is best for them based on what they're willing to spend.  This requires patience and the ability to help people who have little technical background understand what it is you can do for them and how it will benefit their business.  So in many ways, you are just as much (perhaps more of) a business consultant than you are a web site developer.</p>

<p>I love the work, because I've had the opportunity to work with businesses in so many different markets, but customers can also be difficult sometimes, so being able to remain calm and be reassuring is a huge plus.</p>

<p>One way to get started, as crazy as it sounds, is to go door to door talking to small business owners about whether they have a web site.  If not then you could talk to them about their thoughts on perhaps having a small one, at least to let them get started.  If they <em>do</em> have a site already, ask them what they would change or add if they could, then tell them how you can provide that for them.  Once you get your first few jobs, you can ask for referrals, and if you've done good work then you'll get them.  Small business owners always know plenty of other small business owners, so happy clients are a great source of leads.</p>

<p>Most of all, be patient and hang in there.  It takes <em>time</em> to establish yourself in this industry, because there's plenty of competition, and until you have a track record of happy customers or a portfolio of work you've done to show your skills, it will take quite a bit of effort to develop clients.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>To your question about offering lower quality for less -- <strong>NEVER</strong>!  Always give your customers the best you can do for what you charge.  The key there is to make sure they know exactly what they're getting, what it will cost, and why they should consider spending a little more for additional features.  The <strong><em>worst</em></strong> thing you could ever do, especially just starting out, is to cut corners with your clients.  Maybe you'll have to charge lower fees to begin with just to get your first jobs (that's what I did), but as your reputation grows, so do your fees.  </p>

<p>Still, if you're good as a developer, and if you're good at talking with people, then you should do well in the long run.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
