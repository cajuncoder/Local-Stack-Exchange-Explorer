"Is it normal to feel your heart beat in your chest?","278039","","<p>Is it normal for a person to at times feel their heart beat in their chest without actually placing their hand on their chest, while at other times not be able to (even though the pulse is strong, regular and consistent in both instances) or is this potentially a symptom of a cardiovascular disease?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it normal for a person to at times feel their heart beat in their chest without actually placing their hand on their chest, while at other times not be able to...? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is normal.</p>

<p>Normally, people do not feel their heart beating in their chest at rest. It is one of those things similar to breathing - it's happening, but we're not often aware of it (which is good as it might be very distracting otherwise.)</p>

<p>However, an alteration in the steady background of the beating heart is often perceived. Sometimes the alteration is due to increased rate or force of contractions. If so, the sensation of feeling your heart beating (normally under the circumstances) is called <em>physiological palpitations</em> (i.e. normal.) If they are a result of an ""abnormal"" rate or rhythm, the phenomenon is known as ""palpitations"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In normal resting conditions, the activity of the heart is generally not perceived by the individual. However, during or immediately after intense physical activity or emotional stress, it may be quite normal to become aware of one's own heartbeat for brief periods; these sensations are regarded as physiological palpitations, in that they represent the normal or expected response to a certain challenge or activity leading to an increase in the frequency and strength of the contraction of the heart. Outside of such situations, instead, palpitations are perceived as abnormal.<sup>2</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sensory mechanisms responsible for palpitation are unknown.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>What we do know, though, is that if the heart beats faster or more forcefully, we do feel this, both in our chest, and in our necks, as exemplified in the expression, ""my heart rose into my throat."" We have baroreceptors in major blood vessels in our neck; when more blood is pushed into our arteries by a forceful beat, there is an awareness of increased pressure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Palpitations are a symptom defined as awareness of the heartbeat and are described by patients as a disagreeable sensation of pulsation or movement in the chest and/or adjacent areas.<sup>2</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more forceful contraction means more blood is pumped in that heart cycle. This can happen if suddenly stressed (e.g. you're speeding and you see a police car pull into your lane behind you); the adrenaline increases both the rate and the force of your heartbeat.  </p>

<p>Likewise, when you have a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC. The first beat is early; this allows the next cycle to have a longer ""filling time"", and the resultant more forceful contraction will be felt. Medically speaking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In cases of isolated extrasystoles, the augmented post-extrasystolic beat may be felt in place of, or in addition to, the premature beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have an irregular heartbeat - the weaker ones will not be felt, but the more forceful ones will. This often is perceived as a fluttering in the chest.</p>

<p>Finally, some people are just more sensitive to their heart beat. This also occurs in hypervigilant states.</p>

"What does eye power -6 means and how close to blindness is it?","117900","","<p>One of my friends went to an eye specialist for checkup and the doctor told him that his eye power changed from <code>-6</code> from <code>-4.5</code>. He is really very upset and doesn’t want to discuss anything on this. I can understand that -6 means the vision is in very poor state but don’t have any idea how much worse it is. </p>

<ol>
<li>Could someone explain me how what eye power <code>-6</code> means in respect to <strong>closeness of blindness</strong>? </li>
<li>What can be the minimum negative eye power and maximum positive eye power of an eye?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Your units of measure are likely ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"">diopters</a>.""  If someone needs glasses for <em>reading</em> (because the person is far sighted), then they would be given an prescription with a <strong>+</strong>[digit], and note that each eye could be different (and usually is, at least slightly). An example might be:</p>

<pre><code>left eye: +1.5
right eye: +0.75
</code></pre>

<p>If he has a negative number of diopters in his prescription, it just means he is instead near sighted, or <em>myopic</em>: he sees things up close probably pretty well (in the eye with a negative diopter). If both eyes are around -6 diopters (and assuming he doesn't have severe astigmatism on top of this strong near sightedness), he probably needs relatively strong lenses to see distances clearly, and can probably only read an average size font (such as 12-14 points) if it less than a foot (roughly) from his face.</p>

"Is it better to sleep without a pillow?","82250","","<p>I have read several web pages that mention the potential benefits of sleeping without a pillow. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is Sleeping Without a Pillow a Good Choice? Yes, it is. Not only will sleeping with no pillow save your money, but it will also lead to less neck, back, and shoulder pain, higher quality sleep, and even fewer wrinkles! When you were a child, you could fall asleep anywhere without a pillow. The body is resilient and adaptable when we're young. Even as we age, our body, including heads and necks, is able to rest comfortably without the support of a pillow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While sleeping with or without a pillow is a personal preference, there are some medical experts that believe there are real benefits of sleeping without a pillow.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Spinal benefits: Some argue that sleeping without a pillow is the healthiest method of sleeping as it greatly benefits the spine.  Sleeping on your back without a pillow allows the spine to rest fully with the natural curves of the body.  When you sleep with a thick pillow it can displace the spine.</li>
  <li>Facial benefits: Others argue that sleeping without pillows can help reduce wrinkles and other often considered unappealing facial features.  This can be attributed to the fact that the face is not being squished against a pillow.</li>
  <li>Sleep benefits:  Some argue that pillows interfere with quality sleep, especially when people use the wrong pillow.  Sleeping without a pillow helps ensure quality sleep because the body is allowed to be at a normal level and not elevated like with a pillow.</li>
  <li>Neck benefits: The people that believe sleeping without a pillow is best for you, argue that sleeping with a pillow can be the main source of shoulder and neck pain.  It is still good to do stretches and use heat packs, but they say that the best way to alleviate neck pain is to sleep without a pillow.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any scientific study confirming or infirming the claim?</p>
","<p>For most people, it is better to sleep <em>with</em> a pillow according to the latest research.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sleeping without a pillow <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248001"" rel=""noreferrer"">increases interocular pressure</a> which is considered a risk for glaucoma patients. </li>
<li>Sleeping on your side without a pillow increases your risk of osteoarthritis in the neck. If you sleep on your side, your cervical spine bends to the bed. This pinches the openings of the spine (the foramina) and causes bones to push and rub against each other. That friction and pressure causes bone to erode and grow which can create the bone spurs you can often see on cervical x-rays of patients. A pillow raises the head and straightens the spine. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VW1td.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VW1td.jpg"" alt=""cervical spine with a pillow""></a></li>
<li>Sleeping on your back without a pillow changes your neck angle from its normal daily position. When standing, your neck also has a certain curve to it. If you sleep on your back, that curve is also distorted. To simulate the natural curve of the neck, researchers found that about <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512267"" rel=""noreferrer"">10cm of pillow is needed</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, studies suggest that sleeping with a pillow improves sleep quality and fits more physiologically and mechanically with the natural curve of the cervical spine. Even the Egyptians over 3,000 years ago used pillows. Here is King Tutankhamen's headrest around which his pillow linens were wrapped.</p>

"Do you bleed to death after your penis is cut off?","42060","","<p>I wonder If a person without knowledge and tools cuts off somebody's penis and then doesn't call an ambulance immediately, is there a chance a person may not bleed to death within a short time?</p>

<p>I would also like to know if you can still urinate, while the cutting is done without some tool you put into urethra?</p>

<p>I haven't found much related to this topic.
</p>
","<p>Assuming the person is not taking anticoagulants, it's actually quite difficult to bleed to death from dismemberment of small members (hands, feet, penis, ears, nose, etc). Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. </p>

<p>Left to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty.</p>

<p>Could he still urinate? Sure, as long as the urethra wasn't blocked. It could become blocked by clotted blood, but eventually the pressure of a full bladder would overcome the blockage.</p>

"What is this dot on the iris?","37656","","<p>I have a black dot on my iris. Is there a medical term for this? Can it be dangerous?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lg8bs.jpg"" alt=""eye""></p>
","<p>It is difficult to tell from that photograph what the pigmented area represents; a good photograph of the iris is hard to get without a <em>slit-lamp</em> (an instrument for close examination of the eyes.)</p>

<p>Because irises are normally pigmented, they are subject to the same kinds of lesions as other pigmented tissue. The iris can have ""freckles"" (though not caused by the sun), pigmented moles, melanomas, etc. Because the iris is also composed of layers, an absence or indentation of part of the outermost layer of the iris (called a <em>crypt</em>) can be spot-like in appearance.</p>

<p>The following is a photograph of a benign nevus (mole) of the iris:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DbVVsm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DbVVsm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iris nevi are, by definition, pigmented and flat. They are common, may be multiple, and occur more often in blue-eyed patients. Iris nevi are also rarely present at birth and like all other ocular nevi become apparent around puberty. </p>

<p>The following is of an iris nevus taken through a slit lamp:</p>

<p>Here, you can also see freckles on the iris.</p>

<p>The fact that all three photographs feature a spot in the lower half of the iris isn't coincidence. Approximately 80% of them occur in the lower half of the iris.</p>

<p>Lesions in the iris can also be caused by trauma, congenital abnormalities, illnesses, infections, etc.</p>

<p>Iris melanomas can also occur, and arise from iris nevi. Usually they are low-grade tumors, but can be problematic to vision/ocular health, and can become metastatic.**</p>

<p>While the lesion shown in the photograph is statistically likely to be a benign iris nevus, it is impossible to say. The safest course of action is to ask your doctor what it is (even a good office opthalmoscope will afford better visualization that the photograph) and if it needs to be checked further.</p>

"Is eating after brushing before bed all that bad?","33089","","<p>I'm typically very strict about oral hygiene. I'll brush 3 times a day, once in the morning after breakfast, once in the middle of the day, and once in the evening before bed.</p>

<p>Sometimes I get hungry after brushing my teeth in the evening, however, and I'll be tempted to eat something. Whenever I have eaten in the past, I've always followed the food by another light brushing of my teeth.</p>

<p>It occurred to me, however, that the time I spend with an unclean mouth while sleeping is often about the same amount of time between teeth brushing sessions during the day. Is there something about sleep that makes having a clean mouth during it important?</p>
","<h1>Short</h1>

<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/healthy-teeth-14/brushing-teeth-mistakes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">You <strong>should</strong> brush</a>, 20-30 minutes after eating on the night (just before you sleep) <em>and</em>, 10-20 minutes before eating your breakfast. Midday brushing, is not essential for most albeit, it's highly dependent on your dietary habits. The same rule applies: 20-30 minutes after eating or 10-20 minutes before eating. The time-rule is influenced/is-in-place to compensate for the time it takes for the normalization of the oral PH after food consumption (""after a meal""), and the latter being to ensure that the introduction of food stuffs and liquids will not diminish the concentration of the essential <a href=""https://www.dentalhealth.org/tell-me-about/topic/sundry/fluoride"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fluoride</a>, contained within toothpaste, on the tooth surface (""before a meal"").</p>

<hr>

<h1>Long</h1>

<p>Not brushing after you eat, before you sleep on the nighttime, can be likened to having oral excrement...</p>

<p>Whenever you eat/have a meal, our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_microbiology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oral microbiota</a> ingest and metabolize the food particle left over, essentially feasting on whatever we consume. Like every other living organism, these oral bacteria excrete as they reap. However, <em>this</em> secondary excrement is highly <em>acidic</em> and can have some unwanted effects on your tooth enamel: gradually dissolving it and henceforth leading to the occurrence of tooth <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decay</a> (cavities).</p>

<p>When you decide to ""hit the hay"" without brushing, considering you have eaten since, plaque may start to harden and hence, <em>calcify</em> on the surface of your teeth. It's important to know that, once calcification of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plaque</a> on the tooth surface has began to occur, we (yourself), cannot remove it with a toothbrush nor with any amount of <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3576/2344"">floss</a>; it can only be removed by a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_hygienist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dental hygienist</a>  via a routine cleaning using specialist equipment.</p>

<p>It doesn't just stop there! As plaque begins to build up, your immune system treats it as if it's an infection. Your immune system doing what it does best, triggers the release of in situ <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prostaglandins</a>, to trigger an immune response via lipid signalling. As opposed to a ""positive"" immune response, the healthy tissue that adhere the gums to the teeth to the gum surface are attacked and harmed (degenerated) causing it form periodontal pockets and cause <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gum recession</a>. Periodontal pockets, can predispose plaque formation and hence, foreign bacteria colonisation below the gum line - along the tooth <em>root</em>. This healthy tissue is known as the, attached <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gingivae</a> and it doesn't just permit a snug fit, it helps to keep to teeth in place!  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmfMl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmfMl.png"" alt=""Stages of gum disease""></a></p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, inflammation is good thing! Albeit, a long-term presence of inflammation can predispose you to a worrying amount of tissue damage. For example, take the common flu: short-term inflammation is essential for cell signalling, to help route immune factors such as phagocytes, to the site of the harmful bacteria and hence, to ingest and destroy the foreign bacteria -- known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Phagocytosis</a>; helping to make you ""healthier"" again. However, long-term inflammation causes unwanted bodily ""wear and tear"", that has been found to <a href=""https://www.perio.org/consumer/other-diseases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">correlate with some very serious diseases and impairments</a> such as, Heart disease, Dementia and secondary Hearing loss.</p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong> - non of this will happen over the course of one night. But, if it becomes habitual (not brushing before you sleep -- or flossing), the probability of it happening will steeply increase!</p>

<p>Considering that, this small precaution will help save you a heap of money and pain in the future, is it <em>not</em> worth it? Evidence shows that it may even extend your life! </p>

<hr>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The amount of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">saliva</a> produced is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531122"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">greatest</a> when we are awake (during the day), and diminishes greatly during natural sleep and this in fact reduces the ability of our saliva to natural control oral PH and partially digest food particles in our oral cavity. The protein profile (and hence, enzymatic activity) of our <a href=""http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1745-4603.2011.00290.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=onlinelibrary.wiley.com&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">salivary rate is not the same during rest as that, when we are eating or when sleeping</a> - less salivary flow. Salivary secretion during wakefulness is, in part, associated with oromotor activity involving the masseter muscles. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity and swallowing are non-disruptive events that occur during normal sleep. It's hypothesised that the natural lubrication that saliva permits is most-necessary during sleep to protect tissue integrity and health of oroesophageal structures. </p>

<p>Mouth breathers, during sleep need to pay particular attention to oral hygiene as the prominence of ""dry mouth"" is much more evident - this is impirical due to reasons stated above.</p>

"Can you get a yeast infection in your mouth from oral sex?","31576","","<p>I recently had sex with a woman who seems to have had a yeast infection. That's what I thought, because she had lots of white dots in her vagina and my doctor told me that this is a fungus. I've seen it for the first time, so I'm not entirely sure.</p>

<p>However, I gave her oral sex (no unusual smell or taste noticed) and after that I got something that seemed like a tonsillitis. I get tonsillitis all the time, that's why I'll get my tonsils removed next month.</p>

<p>However, this time I tried two different antibiotics, but none of them worked. Also, no painkillers, not even Tramadol helped. I had to go into the hospital and got two different intravenous antibiotics. After 3 days and another 5 days using standard antibiotics, the ""tonsillitis"" was cured.</p>

<p>That's what I was wondering... It hurt <em>a lot</em>. I couldn't even eat. I've never had a tonsillitis that bad and I certainly never went to the hospital because of one. Also it was noticeable that the skin of the deeper part of the throat was irritated a lot.</p>

<p>So this has left me curious: <strong>is it possible to get a yeast infection in the mouth from sex?</strong></p>
","<p>The yeast (fungus) that causes thrush or yeast infection in both men and women are of the genus Candida.  These fungi can be found as normal flora on skin however outgrowth results in yeast infection.  Candida albicans, which is most likely the strain of thrush you saw on the lady, can be transmitted by both sex and oral sex.  Most likely your mucosal immune system will fight it, but there are cases of transmission especially in HIV patients (Francoise, et al., 1997).  If you notice a fever, lethargy, and white irritating spots in the oral cavity, I would seek help from a health professional.  The infection is easily treated.</p>

<p>Antibiotics will not work for fungal infection, as the mechanism of action is different from fungicide.  Tonsillitis is usually caused by either a viral infection such as Herpes Simplex Virus, or a bacterial infection. Again, treatable and highly recommend seeking professional help.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Tonsils are a lymphatic organ, meaning it contains specialised immune cells that work together to identify invading pathogens and clear it.  Tonsillitis happens due to an inflammatory reaction towards an invading pathogen.  Some people have severe inflammation resulting in partial or complete blockage of their airway, thus being potentially life threatening. In these cases, the patient is recommended to undergo tonsillectomy - the removal of their tonsil.  If your tonsillitis is not life threatening (an just an inconvenience) it may not be necessary to remove it.  Again I would consult with your doctor, as there may be indications for removing it and contraindications as well that are specific to your medical history [4,5].</p>

"how it's better to drink water, fast or slowly?","31362","","<p>I usually drink water by small slips and I read that it's the best way to do this, <a href=""http://www.elephantjournal.com/2013/10/the-art-of-drinking-water-10-ayurvedic-tips-for-a-happily-hydrated-body-julie-bernier/"">for example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>First off, sit down to drink (just as you should sit down to eat).</p></li>
  <li><p>Take sips, not full-glass chugs. Small sip, swallow, breathe. Repeat.</p></li>
  <li><p>Sip water throughout the day. If you chug too much water at once your body doesn’t actually absorb all of it. Most of it will run right
  through you.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>But one of my friend told me that her doctor said that she should not drink water by small slips, but drink at least half of glass at once. Otherwise he said your bladder is always active.</p>

<p>I have doubts that it can be right, but not sure, can doctor be mistaken?</p>
","<p>I don't see a lot of difference between drinking few sips and 1 cup (8 oz, 237 mL) of water at once.</p>

<p>If you drink a large amount of water at once, for example, 500 mL (2 cups, 16 oz), all this water will be quickly absorbed and will expand the blood volume. Volume receptors in the heart will detect an increase of blood volume and will trigger excretion of some water from the blood through the kidneys before the water could reach the body cells. This way the drinking will be less efficient than drinking smaller amounts, like 1 cup at the time.</p>

<p>This can be true even when you are dehydrated and you, for example, miss 2 liters of water in your body (you can know that by weighing yourself). When you drink 1 liter of water at once (still only the half of the amount you miss) you may observe that you will need to urinate shortly after that (because of mechanism described above). If you drink smaller amounts, like 1 cup (237 mL) at the time, for example, 30 min apart, you have a better chance to keep a greater percent of water in your body.</p>

<p><strong>Water intoxication</strong> is not studied by experiments, from obvious reasons, so the most knowledge about this comes from case reports and newspaper news.</p>

<p>According to one report, a woman who was on a low-calorie and hence low-sodium diet for about a week, drank 4 liters of water in 2 hours and later died in hospital from water intoxication (hyponatremia).
<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bradford/7779079.stm"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bradford/7779079.stm</a>
This is the lowest amount to cause water intoxication in adults, I've heard of.</p>

<p>One US military source recommends drinking only up to 1.4 liters of water per hour, when you drink it for several hours in a row.

Most online sources that claim this say it's an ""old army trick,"" but after reading <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706344/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">several</a> perspectives on wound care in the <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=ApUwm4KJJFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cauterization%20Care%20of%20the%20Combat%20Amputee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin_cqQ-6rKAhWIZCYKHewEAx4Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cauterization%20Care%20of%20the%20Combat%20Amputee&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">military</a>, I don't know that is true.</p>

<p>The actual historical roots on this idea I could find actually go back to reference a <a href=""http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0708/2006049193-s.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">slave owner</a> using it as a form of abuse to over work his slave, or a <a href=""https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=SBNT19150714.1.13"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">short fiction</a> story from 1915.</p>

<p>The problem is one of timing.  As wars started to utilize gun powder more, tourniquets were realized to be superior to cauterization (first ideas of tourniquets go back to ~1500's, serious implantation with Jean Petit in early 1700's).  By the time we get to something like Vietnam, not only would the solders have had tourniquets, if they were going to cauterize the wound they would have done it chemically.</p>

<p>Another problem is the gas and force released from igniting gun powder.  It doesn't just burn hot, it propels.  That's why it's useful for moving bullets.  I think this would likely further distort the tissue, and if applied in large amounts in to major arteries/veins, a good deal of toxicity problems.</p>

<p>I just honestly think this would cause more harm than good.  I'd be very interested if someone can find a documented example of where this was actually tried in the field (and I missed it).  Considering you can't readily treat your own neck, the appropriate thing to do would be to apply direct pressure with your hands to the places that are bleeding the most (or if you're the one helping, then the same to the other person's neck).  </p>

<p>Oddly enough I have a <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11058/how-to-close-a-severed-artery-vein/11088#11088"">more detailed SE answer</a> written up in Bio, for those interested in proper wound care in the neck.</p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>I was made aware the ""Dual Survival"" episode where one of the characters cauterizes a wound (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFGE7rGUkA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube Video Here</a> and then <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eerOKfiOuQ4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).  You will note that even the survivalist unequivocally rejected this method as valid before he did it to himself (presumably for considerable compensation from Discovery Channel).  I reject this as a valid example for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>That was a shallow wound where the bleeding was mostly controlled, (from the video you can see that it is hardly bleeding), and as a wound caused by a clean cut, could and should be controlled with pressure and binding.</p></li>
<li><p>You can see that the initial load of gun powder did not ignite, some initial cauterization probably occurred by dropping whatever was on fire onto the cut (looked like moss).  Further, as mentioned in the video, the gunpowder was mixing with his blood and stinging, a pretty good sign it was being introduced into his blood stream, which could cause toxicity problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the shallow nature of this cut, much of the gas released was able to burst out and away from his arm.  In a wound actually calling for cauterization, the powder would have had to been placed much deeper.  Think of this problem as the difference between igniting black powder on the top of a rock vs packing it into a deep crack.  Only one of those leads to an exploding rock. </p></li>
<li><p>Further, this brings up the problem of technology again.  If they had a knife to heat, and were dead set on cauterization, they should have used the heated knife.  No additional benefit of gunpowder would be had, and there are several clear drawbacks.  As someone who hunts and hikes often, how many times will you be walking around with black powder (not newer gunpowder formulations) without a good knife?  Or for that matter, a belt and cloth and the ability to make a tourniquet (even a make-shift one).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, the wound in the video doesn't even call for a tourniquet, to say nothing of cauterization.  This is an example of something that makes sensational TV does not make good medical sense, and probably helps spread medical misconceptions and ignorance (as the premise of the show is to help demonstrate survivalist techniques).</p>

"Use of antibiotics and the night gap","26082","","<p>I was wondering, if medications such as antibiotics are to be taken 4 times or more a day (so every 6 hours), what happens during the night with such a long gap in between (8 hours). I have heard that the impact of medication lessens if the dosage is delayed, so how come sleep through the night without medication is okay? </p>
","<p>There are very few (but there <em>are</em> some) medications that need to be taken at very strict time intervals; early drugs for AIDS needed to be taken even in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>No one expects <em>four times a day</em> to mean, literally, every 6 hours on the minute. The dose is calculated to cover that period of rest (sleep).</p>

<p>To understand this, you need to understand steady state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.</p>

<p>After a certain number of doses, a drug builds up in the body <em>to a steady state</em> - meaning it stays more or less in the same concentration in the blood between doses, or to put it another way, the amount being taken in and the amount being eliminated by the body are about equal.</p>

<p>It's not guesswork; researchers study the drug before it's even released to determine such things (see the second reference.) Pharmacokinetic studies determine the dosages at which the concentration of a particular drug/antibiotic is always high enough between doses such that serum levels don't fall below effective levels.</p>

<p>Say a drug under investigation is given every 12 hours. Blood is drawn at frequent intervals over a number of doses for to determine peak levels (the time at which the concentration in the blood is highest) and trough levels (the time when the drug is the lowest.) If at the trough level the drug is below that needed to be effective, the dosing interval decreases: the subject must take it more frequently, say every 8 hours. This cycle continues until the ideal dosage and dose interval is established. The final recommendation takes into account how long you can go without taking the drug and still have enough drug - how to take the drug such that the steady state is maintained - if you sleep.</p>

<p>If a drug falls below the effective dose quickly (say it is metabolized into an ineffective product), and a satisfactory prolonged serum level can't be arrived at, the prescribing physician will alert you to the fact that you <em>must</em> take it to as close to how it's prescribed as possible, and will tell you what to do if you miss a dose.</p>

<p>When the timing of administration of life-saving drugs is <em>critical</em>, it's not uncommon to hospitalize a patient to assure such administration.</p>

<blockquote>

"Does hot water kill germs better than cold water?","24043","","<p>I was recently told that I should use hot water to wash my hands rather than using cold water because the hot water will kill germs better. The person who told me this isn't a very reliable source, so I'm not sure if I should believe them or not. It does seem like it makes sense, though.</p>

<p><strong>Does washing your hands with hot water kill germs better than washing them with cold water?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>Surprisingly, no</strong>. Hot water does kill bacteria, but what's comfortable for your hands is also pretty comfortable for bacteria. Most pathogens start to die off around 60°C to 70°C (140°F to 158°F)<sup><a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-2-the-pre-travel-consultation/water-disinfection-for-travelers"">1</a></sup>, but water from the ""hot"" tap in a sink is typically below that (40° to 55°C or 104° to 131°F)<sup><a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/12/131213-washing-hands-hot-water-wastes-energy-health/"">2</a></sup>. In order to kill bacteria, the water would have to be way too hot for you to tolerate.</p>

<p>According to National Geographic, in <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/12/131213-washing-hands-hot-water-wastes-energy-health/"">Washing Hands in Hot Water Wastes Energy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carrico said that after a review of the scientific literature, her team found ""no evidence that using hot water that a person could stand would have any benefit in killing bacteria."" Even water as cold as 40°F (4.4°C) appeared to reduce bacteria as well as hotter water, if hands were scrubbed, rinsed, and dried properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This agrees with the World Health Organization's conclusion<sup><a href=""http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597906_eng.pdf"">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Water temperature</strong> -
  Apart from the issue of skin tolerance and level of comfort,
  water temperature does not appear to be a critical factor for
  microbial removal from hands being washed. In contrast, in a
  study comparing water temperatures of 4 °C, 20 °C and 40 °C,
  warmer temperatures have been shown to be very significantly
  associated with skin irritation. The use of very hot water for
  handwashing should therefore be avoided as it increases the
  likelihood of skin damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of studies that have looked into water temperature and handwashing and concluded that there is little to no added benefit to washing with hotter water, for example:</p>

"Why do I urinate more in the morning?","23628","","<p>I usually drink a tall glass of water right before bedtime to stay hydrated through the night. In the morning, as expected, I have a full bladder and have to pee.</p>

<p>But, roughly an hour later, I usually have to pee again, even though I haven't consumed anything since waking up. Why is that? Why didn't it all come out the first time?</p>

<p>My two theories, FWIW:</p>

<ul>
<li>I drank more water than my bladder can hold. My body is smart enough to know when my bladder is full, and it holds on to excess water until I've emptied it.</li>
<li>My body retains water while I sleep for some other reason, and begins to move it to my bladder after I wake up.</li>
</ul>
","<p>In healthy patients, a circadianic rhythm of urine excretion <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17335055"">has been observed</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945293"">The rhythm of glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys</a>. They <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2667855"">decrease filtration of urine at night.</a></li>
<li>Many of the hormones which influence renal urine production - and also the parasympathetic/sympathetic nervous system, which controls bladder function - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138846/"">follow observable day and night rhythms</a>. </li>
<li>The former study also states that there is a possibility for regulatory clock genes, which might directly influence urine production or the urge to urinate.  They could be located in the bladder itself or the neurons controlling its function, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752602/"">or in the kidneys</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>The role of this rhythm is still unclear. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138846/"">In mice, the circadianic rhythm of urine excretion was lost 2 days into exposure to total darkness.</a></p>

<p>So, altogether, there is evidence of multifactorial contributions to an observable circadianic rhythm of urine excretion of unknown purpose. But it is clear that at night, your kidneys filtrate and thus produce less, and the tonus of the bladder muscles is also decreased, in summary leading to your bladder preserving more urine for the morning, possibly ""to give you some rest"" at night.

<p>Even decaffeinated coffee seems to have this effect, which seems strange to me (although I am aware that it still contains a small amount of caffeine). I typically drink green tea instead of coffee, since the effect is more mild.</p>

<p>Is this an indication that my body metabolizes caffeine faster (or slower?) than normal? What else can cause caffeine sensitivity?</p>
","<p>Caffeine metabolism has to do with your genetic makeup. The slower you metabolize caffeine, the more effect it will have on you. The cause for the differences that people have in how fast they metabolize caffeine has to depend on the CYP1A2 gene. Variants of this gene can cause you to metabolize faster or slower. The C allele variant in the AHR gene, which controls the turning on and off the the CYP1A2 gene, is common in people who have a high metabolism for caffeine. You probably do not have this variant. That with a few other factors that depend on variants in your DNA are the reason that caffeine has a strong effect on you.</p>

<p>I've read (<a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxym%C3%A9trie_colorim%C3%A9trique"">non-sourced Wikipedia FR fragment</a>, no mention of this in Wikipedia EN) and heard (informal discussions with medical and rescue staff) that this value decreases significantly if the subject is a smoker.</p>

<p>This raises the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is this true, and why? </p></li>
<li><p>What are usual SpO2 values for smokers? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>When I was a smoker, my own SpO2 was usually 100%. The saturation of my smoker colleagues who tried is also normal. This doesn't prove anything as this does not constitute a study - just a bunch of measure without methodolology -, this is just to say I never observed this phenomenon.</p>
","<p>The OP observes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was a smoker, my own SpO2 was usually 100%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although <em>long-term</em> smoking often does lead to changes in the lungs that cause hypoxemia (low peripheral O<sub>2</sub> Saturation, a.k.a. SpO<sub>2</sub>), these effects are not immediate. In fact, in the short term, SpO<sub>2</sub> may even be spuriously <strong>high</strong>, consistent with your observation. We should distinguish between the factors that drive changes in O<sub>2</sub> saturation in long-term when compared to short-term smoking.*</p>

<h2>Short term</h2>

<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/505/165"">Another answer</a> discussed the increased carbon monoxide (CO) levels in smokers, which <em>is</em> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739872"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an immediate effect of the inhaled cigarette smoke that is dose-dependent</a> (i.e. heavy smokers will inhale more CO than light smokers). </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/pulmonary/oximetry_92,p07754/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A pulse oximeter</a> measures the percentage of circulating hemoglobin to which oxygen is bound. By standard pulse oximetry, <a href=""http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/injuries-poisoning/poisoning/carbon-monoxide-poisoning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">carboxy-hemoglobin is indistinguishable from oxyhemoglobin</a>. Also, carbon monoxide causes a left-shift of the <a href=""http://www.ventworld.com/resources/oxydisso/dissoc.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve</a>. This means the hemoglobin is holding onto the oxygen more tightly, resulting in a higher saturation of hemoglobin. It is for both of these reasons that students are often taught about the <a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Carbon+Monoxide+Poisoning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">“cherry red” appearance of skin</a> and mucous membranes in carbon monoxide poisoning.** In contrast to hypoxemia (low SpO<sub>2</sub>) when mucous membranes tend to turn blue due to low oxygen saturation, the hemoglobin saturation in carbon monoxide poisoning will be seen (both by our eyes and by pulse oximetry) as high. <strong><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=buckley+pulse+oximetry+gap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pulse oximetry may be spuriously high</a> in smokers due to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin.</strong> </p>

<p>In most young, healthy people, oxygen saturation is 98-100% anyway, so this difference is usually negligible. However, the point remains that the OP’s observation is fully consistent with the effects of short-term smoking.</p>

<h2>Long-term</h2>

<p>Long-term smokers frequently do have low oxygen saturation <em>despite</em> the spurious elevation due to carbon monoxide. A full explanation of the mechanism would require a textbook of respiratory physiology. The basic idea is that the toxins in cigarette smoke lead to inflammation and remodeling in the lung that cause both <a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/copd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">obstructive pulmonary disease</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLCO"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decreased alveolar diffusing capacity</a>. </p>

<p>It has been shown that <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24307008"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">early inflammatory changes are present even in young smokers with normal pulmonary function tests</a>. These microscopic changes in the lung do not cause measurable changes in oxygen saturation or pulmonary function tests.

"What's the difference between etiology, pathogenesis, pathology, pathophysiology and epidemiology?","21140","","<p>Most of my searches either end up explaining any of the above words in terms of the other four, or explaining the concept in simple words in such a way that makes it difficult to see the difference between them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>A simple google search took me to medicinenet.com - </p>

<p>pathology -  ""that branch of medicine which treats of the essential nature of disease.""</p>

<p>etiology - ""The study of causes, as in the causes of a disease.""</p>

<p>Pathogenesis: ""The development of a disease and the chain of events leading to that disease.""</p>

<p>So I decided to try wikipedia as, I felt, all <em>definitions</em> will necessarily fail to actually explain the differences between them as the differences are pretty nuanced.</p>

<p>But wikipedia articles on these terms were either very detailed or very general, in the sense that although I understood what they were saying in any particular article, I still couldn't figure out how the rest of the terms were referring to something different. All seemed to mean - understanding why and how diseases work/spread and how to control them. </p>

<p>The only term I understood distinctly here was epidemiology, which means studying the occurrence of diseases in a given population (thus putting a geographical limitation).</p>

<p>I guess I'm looking more for an explanation which draws a parallel to convey the message. Definitions won't work.</p>

<p>For ex, if someone were to ask me the difference between environment, habitat, ecotone and niche, I would try something along the lines of - </p>

<p>Environment = library</p>

<p>Habitat = different sections (like literature, reference, philosophy etc)</p>

<p>Ecotone = gate of library</p>

<p>Niche = the place a particular student occupies in that library through his interaction with other students etc</p>
","<p>To get an understanding of the difference, look at a disease that has been in the news recently, Legionnaire's Disease.</p>

<p>Legionella pneumophilia is a bacteria that is responsible for most cases. It lives in stagnant water under certain conditions, and is inhaled when aerosalized. This is the etiology of the disease, which is basically how it infects the host, or how it gets in.</p>

<p>Once inside the body, it starts replicating and causing damage. Initial symptoms include flu like symptoms, headache, fatigue and muscle pain. As it progresses, they can expand to include dry coughing, chest pain, and eventually leading to possible mental status changes, hallucination, etc. This progression of the disease in the various stages is the pathogenesis of the disease, i.e. days 1-3 expect these symptoms, days 4-7 these other symptoms, and so on.</p>

<p>To confirm the diagnosis, the doctors will take samples of various body fluids and send them to the lab for testing, as well as x-rays, etc. One of the tests is staining of the sputum that can show the Legionella bacteria. This is pathology, specifically the examination of body fluid/tissue for diagnostic purposes. (Where it gets a little confusing, is pathology also refers to the body of knowledge about disease cause and effects).</p>

<p>So in a general sense you are correct, they all refer to how/why diseases spread and how to control them, but one doesn't necessarily depend on the other.</p>

<p>Edited to add: Pathophysiology is kind of an intersection, to where the pathology of a condition and the physiology are taken as a whole, and describes the functions and changes associated with a condition from both the observable and the testable views.</p>

<p>And what happens if one takes more than 2400mg in a whole day. 
Let's say 3000mg? Or even 3600mg? </p>

<p>Reason for taking ibuprofen is toothache being like hell or worse if any!</p>
","<p>Using any medication, including ibuprofen, in doses higher than recommended,  is very unwise. There is a reason that patient information leaflets exist, and that health professionals insist that the patients read and understand these leaflets (and ask questions when necessary) prior to consumption.</p>

<p>First of all, ibuprofen is a non-steroid anti-inflamatory drug (NSAID). If the cause of your toothache is tooth decay (cavities) it will treat the pain, i.e the symptom, but not the underlying cause of your toothache. There might be another reason for your toothache, but nonetheless: <strong>if you are experiencing unbearable pain this is definitely a reason to see a doctor, or in this case a dentist.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Recommended daily dose of ibuprofen for an adult is 1.2g to 1.8g <strong>in divided doses</strong> which means that you could take up to 1800 mg during a day - that is during a 24 hour period, but definitely not all at once. And yes, taking them 30 minutes apart is pretty much the same as at once, given ibuprofen's kinetics. These recommendations are based on an average adult, with a healthy liver and kidneys. </p>

<p>Sometimes this dose may be increased up to 2.4g (UK) or even 3.2g (USA) and this would be the <strong>maximal daily dose</strong>. (Martindale) However, this is not a common practice for a toothache. </p>

<p>There are side effects associated with the use of ibuprofen, and many of them are dose-dependent. </p>

<p>From NHS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ibuprofen can cause a number of side effects.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>For this reason, take the lowest possible dose of ibuprofen for the shortest possible time needed to control your symptoms. The same source lists some of the possible side-effects.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>nausea </li>
<li>vomiting </li>
<li>diarrhoea </li>
<li>indigestion (dyspepsia)</li>
<li>abdominal pain</li>
</ul>

<p>Some less common:</p>

<ul>
<li>headache</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>fluid retention (bloating)</li>
<li>raised blood pressure</li>
<li>gastritis (inflammation of the stomach)</li>
<li>a stomach ulcer</li>
<li>allergic reactions – such as a rash</li>
<li>worsening of asthma symptoms by causing bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways)</li>
<li>kidney failure</li>
</ul>

<p>In high doses there are additional risks, such as those for the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Data from meta-analyses and epidemiological studies indicate that there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events (such as myocardial infarction or stroke) associated with the use of high-dose ibuprofen (at or above 2,400 mg per day).1-4</em></p>
  
  <p><em>The risk with high-dose ibuprofen is similar to the risk seen with some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including COX-2 inhibitors and diclofenac.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from: European Medicines Agency).</p>

<hr>

<p>Ibuprofen might interact with and increase the toxicity of some other concomitantly used medication, such as: aspirin, ciclosporin, fluconasole, voriconasole, colestiramine, mifepristone, tacrolimus, methotrexate, lithium, zidovudine, warfarin, ciprofibrate, baclofen...</p>

<p>If you are taking any other medication with ibuprofen, the best course of action is to consult with a healthcare professional first.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, although ibuprofen is an OTC, higher potency preparations, such as those of 600mg per dose are actually prescription only in many countries.</p>

<hr>

<p>A side note: I don't even know how to comment on your: ""let's take a lot of this medication and see what happens"" approach. Medicines are not candy. If you behave so recklessly about your own health, who else is supposed to take care of it for you?  </p>

"What are the different eyesight measures and how are they related to each other?","18607","","<p>While searching about laser surgery for my myopia, I came across different system to measure the quality of individuals' eye sight. When speaking about quality of eyesight, I am referring to the classic test where one has to read smaller and smaller symbols (usually letters or numbers).</p>

<p>I found four different measures:</p>

<ol>
<li>One is a scale from 0 to 1.0+, where the average/normal eyesight is 1.0. People can be above but I don't know how much higher than average.</li>
<li>Another scale from 0 to 20+, the average between 20. I guess that this one is proportionally related to the first one.</li>
<li>I saw negative integers (like -5,-2) sometimes, but I didn't understand how they work exactly. I guess they measure how bad your eyesight is compare to average.</li>
<li>My optometrist used dioptries. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My question</strong>: what are the (most used) measure of the quality eyesight and how do they relate to each other?</p>
","<p>First of all, one has to distinguish between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>visual acuity</strong></a> (VA), which is a measure for the maximal possible resolution your eye-brain-system can achieve, and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>refractive error</strong></a>, which measures the deviation of the optical system of your eye from <em>emmetropy</em> (=perfectly balanced optics, sharp focus on retina without any glasses) in <em>diopters</em> of spheres and cylinders and thus determines what corrective glasses you need to wear in front of your eye in order to achieve your maximum possible visual acuity. </p>

<p>Visual acuity can be measured without corrective glasses, i.e. the ""native"" VA of your eye, or with your best corrective glasses, which then gives you the value of your ""Best-corrected visual acuity"" (BCVA), and only this value is useful for comparison purposes, e.g. for driver's licenses (because errors that <em>can</em> be corrected by glasses also <em>are</em> to be corrected by law, as this is rather easy to do for everybody), and also for scientific evaluation of eye performance.</p>

<p>This also explains a common misconception: When somebody is very near- or farsighted (myope or hyperope), he has to wear glasses with a high (absolute) value of diopters, e.g. -7 dpt. But if he reaches 20/20 vision with his glasses on (again, BCVA), then to an eye doctor, this will matter the most; for the glasses are neglegible in comparison to ""real"" eye diseases which can impair your eye function and lower the BCVA your eye can reach. Many people incorrectly compare their eye functions by comparing the amount of diopters in their glasses, yet this doesn't really say anything about the maximum resolution their eyes have when wearing their best glasses. Refractive errors can be corrected by glasses, contact lenses and laser surgery, but the maximum visual acuity an eye-brain-system is able to achieve can <em>not</em> be altered in any (simple) way.</p>

<p>Now, when visual acuity is measured, a <em>full</em> visual acuity, i.e. ""normal"", or 100%, or any way you'd like to name it, has once simply deliberately been determined by a minimum angle of resolution of 1 arc minute, and the charts that are used for testing it have letters that correspond with this resolution. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc"" rel=""noreferrer"">1 arc minute</a> of resolution corresponds to being able to separate two points with 2,91 cm between them at a distance of 100 m. Now note that this does <em>not</em> necessarily correspond with what most people are able to see; as said previously, the definition of 100% visual acuity was deliberate.
The capability to distinguish points with 1 arc minute of space between them has been defined as 20/20 (or 6/6) vision in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"" rel=""noreferrer"">Snellen charts</a>, 1.0 vision in <a href=""http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/2499/Visual%20Acuity%20Conversion%20Chart.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">decimal charts (conversion table)</a>, and later 0.0 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogMAR_chart"" rel=""noreferrer"">logMAR</a>, which is the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and which has become <a href=""http://www.icoph.org/dynamic/attachments/resources/icovisualacuity1984.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">the gold standard in measuring and comparing visual acuity</a> (see p.13 for conversion chart), but is predominantly used for scientific purposes and less in clinical environments. </p>

<p>This is basic knowledge in optics, optometry and ophthalmology. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> describes the correlations between the terms pretty well.</p>

"Can coffee worsen or trigger a cough?","18054","","<p>I had dry cough for a week now, haven't taken any meds for it and drinking 3 black coffees in a day is a routine for me. A friend told me it could worsen my cough, but she can't elaborate why. </p>

<p>I  didn't believe her because I know coffee is sort of an antioxidant,  but to clear things would it really trigger or worsen my coughing?(Im actually a Barista so i can't resist from having coffee, though I tried not having a shot for a day) </p>
","<p>The quick answer is unfortunately it depends.</p>

<p>If we break this question down, there are three ways coffee would likely be able to effect a cough:</p>

<ol>
<li>The coffee directly interacts with virus (and it is most likely a virus) causing the cough</li>
<li>Coffee could directly effect your immune system in such a way that it changed your body's ability to respond to the pathogen</li>
<li>Coffee could be directly interacting with your nervous system which induces the cough reflex (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222934/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neurogenic cough</a> is a real problem)</li>
</ol>

<p>For item 1, I've seen <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25050906"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some evidence</a> that coffee might actually help stop flu.  For the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">common cold</a>, which is mostly likely (*) one of a few viruses, I couldn't find any evidence of caffeine or the other known <a href=""http://llufb.llu.lv/conference/foodbalt/2011/FOODBALT-Proceedings-2011-110-115.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biologically active components of coffee</a> effecting them one way or the other.  There could be another interaction here that we don't know about it, and it could be positive or negative, so at the moment this might be a slight reason to drink coffee, not avoid it. </p>

<p>(*) It's worth noting I disagree with the breakdown of viral prevalence listed in Wikipedia, and have discussed as much in a <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21507/why-dont-we-develop-immunity-against-common-cold/21802#21802"">Bio.SE answer</a>.</p>

<p>2) Ok there has been a looooot of research on caffeine and the immune system, especially when related to exercise.  Some will say it <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558577"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">helps</a>, others <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308693"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not much</a> (especially under <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21152932"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">usual conditions</a>), and an <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974722"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">honest review</a> on it concludes that there are too many other factors that dictate whether caffeine has an effect (with exercise) that we can't really know.  But this when considering healthy patients.  With sick cells, animals, or people we can know more.</p>

<p>At really <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149008"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high doses</a> caffeine can be anti-inflammatory, but it's probably not a good idea for the general public to be dosing that much caffeine.</p>

<p>This is where things get a little confusing and more relevant.  At much more normal doses, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19564571"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">caffeine is proinflammatory</a> in the lung.  So if you have an on going infection in the lung, you don't want to encourage the inflammation (which is probably causing the caugh).</p>

<p>That said, if you chronically drink coffee, your <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465359"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">body may have tolerized</a> to it, and the effect could be minimal (might be minimal anyway, see the sports guys).</p>

<p>Number 3 is actually a lot harder, as things can very based on a lot of other factors (like tolerance).  If you have a caffeine overdose, a lot of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196726"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bad things</a> can happen.  One of them is that nerves might fire <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">action potentials</a> at <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8556193"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lower thresholds</a>, which could mean the nerves detecting the inflammation in your lungs could fire more easily.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465359"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chances are</a>, however, that <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314542"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">they won't</a>, and you won't be drinking an unusual amount of coffee.</p>

<hr>

<p>To conclude, in an acute infection I would recommend avoiding caffeine, but it won't cause an undo amount of harm.  Decaf will even have the other compounds whose benefit would otherwise be swamped out by caffeine.</p>

"Safety of using a luggage with the prop. 65 warning","17053","","<p>I recently bought a luggage set from Nautica and it came with a ""California 65 warning: This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm.""</p>

<p>Is it safe to use? I won't ""eat"" the luggage or anything similar, but is it possible to be affected just by being in contact with it?</p>

<p>I know that many products receive this warning in California, but it doesn't specify how carcinogen it is.</p>
","<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_65_(1986)"">California Proposition 65</a> warning doesn't really tell you anything about the safety of the luggage.</p>

<p>Proposition 65 <em>requires</em> warnings if somebody may be exposed to a substance that has a 1 in 100,000 chance of causing cancer over the course of 70 years, or has the possibility of causing birth defects or reproductive harm, as determined by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Office_of_Environmental_Health_Hazard_Assessment"">California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment</a>.</p>

<p>However, there is nothing preventing warnings even if there is no risk whatsoever.  Proposition 65 permits members of the general public to sue over missing warnings, and California has a cottage industry of lawyers filing these suits any time they find something that doesn't have such a warning.  As a result, these warnings are often used as an incantation to ward off lawyers rather than an actual indication of hazard.  See, for example, <a href=""http://ag.ca.gov/prop65/pdfs/G035101.pdf"">Consumer Defense Group v. Rental Housing Industry members</a>, where the list of potential carcinogens included ""automobile exhaust from cars in the parking lot"" and ""the possibility that someone on the grounds of the apartment building might be smoking a cigarette"".  As part of the initial settlement of that suit, a warning was posted at the entrance to each building referring to a two-page list of things that might reasonably be found in or around an apartment building -- not because the apartment had lead-based paint, or used perchloroethylene cleaners, or had asbestos insulation, but to prevent further lawsuits.</p>

"Rashes on back of knees","16502","","<p>For a few weeks now, I have had inexplicable rashes on the backs of my legs, behind the knee area.  It looks like some odd highly-localized form of eczema.  They are sometimes itchy, and they get better and worse over time, but never quite go away.  What might be causing them?  I don't have this skin phenomenon anywhere else on my body:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OhdAx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>From the picture and the symptoms you mentioned, especially the itchiness, it seems that you are right about it being that being eczema. Also, eczema is common behind the knees. From that picture though, it does not seem like that eczema is very bad. There are a lot of <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/eczema-causes"" rel=""nofollow"">worse cases</a>. Though there is still some dispute in the medical world, one study<a href=""http://nationaleczema.org/study-reveals-eczema/"" rel=""nofollow""><sup>1</sup></a> says that the cause of eczema is a bacteria that lives on the skin. This bacteria blocks the sweat ducts, which causes a reaction in the immune system that causes irritation, itchiness, and rashes. </p>

<p>WebMD<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/eczema-causes"" rel=""nofollow""><sup>2</sup></a> says that it is likely that the immune system causes the reaction, but they also provide some other possible causes, such as genetics (eczema is usually common in families), certains environments you may be, and skin irritants like chlorine, makeup, and even some soaps and cleansers. It is likely that these skin irritants cause the bacteria mentioned above to react, which in turn cause the immune system to create rashes and irritation on certain parts of the skin.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for treating eczema</strong></p>

<p>Other than drugs that can be prescribed by your doctor, there are a few things you can do to help treat eczema. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use more mild soap - some soaps can cause dry skin; these are the types of soap that tend to irritate eczema; try to get soaps that won't make your skin dry (usually your doctor can recommend a brand)</p></li>
<li><p>Showering - taking long, hot showers can also cause your skin to dry up; instead take shorter, <strong>warm</strong> (not hot) showers</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce stress - stress can be a factor for an irritation in your body; just relax sometimes; also, try to get more sleep</p></li>
<li><p>Petroleum jelly - using petroleum jelly on the spot of the eczema can help relieve the need to scratch</p></li>
<li><p>Moisturize your skin - dry skin is a side effect of eczema, so moisturizing your skin is important</p></li>

"Do Benadryl and Loratadine contain the same active ingredient?","16497","","<p>When I get bad Hay Fever, I take either Benadryl or Loratadine. I am wondering what the active ingredients are in these, and Is it okay to take them both together (or would that be over dosing)?</p>

<p>On top of that, is there any <em>benefit</em> to taking them both at once - should I stagger them or just take one or the other - whichever works best for me?</p>
","<p>No, they do not contain the same active ingredient. Benadryl (trade name) is also known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine"">diphenhydramine</a> (generic name); <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loratadine"">loratidine</a> (generic name) is also known as Claritin (trade name). Both drugs are primarily antihistamines and primarily active antagonists at the H1 subtype of histamine receptor. It is this property that makes them effective for treatment of allergies. </p>

<p>The difference between the two medications is that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine"">diphenhydramine</a> is a first generation or “non-selective” antihistamine. The term “non-selective” refers to these drugs' activity at a variety of receptors other than H1 - primarily, acetylcholine receptors. This can lead to more anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, etc. First generation antihistamines are also highly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilicity"">lipophilic</a>, which means they cross the blood-brain barrier and have central nervous system activity. It is this property which makes them quite sedating (primarily due to activity at CNS histamine receptors).</p>

<p>Second generation antihistamines were designed to avoid some of the side effects of first generation agents. They are more specific for the H1 receptor and are mostly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophobicity"">lipophobic</a>, meaning they poorly penetrate the blood-brain barrier, resulting in fewer CNS effects. For more information about antihistamines, this <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50558/"">Drug Class Review</a> is quite informative. </p>

<p><strong>Is one better than the other for hay fever?</strong> </p>

<p>Probably not. It’s just a matter of dose that determines how much anti-histamine activity each provides. The trouble is that many people will find the side effects of diphenhydramine and other non-selective agents to be dose-limiting, in which case practically it may not be as effective.</p>

<p><strong>Should they be taken together (staggered or otherwise)?</strong></p>

<p>I see no clear benefit to this. Again, their activity against hay fever is mediated by the same receptor. As such, they will just have additive effects. Taking twice as much of one or the other would similarly increase activity against hay fever and/or to contribute to untoward side effects. So it’s “OK” to take them together in the same way that it’s “OK” to take twice as much of either one. </p>

<p>In general, I see little reason to use diphenhydramine for allergic indications unless there is a desire for the sedative properties. Loratadine and other second generation agents have overtaken it in usefulness in this area.</p>

"Does keeping different types of medications in one pill bottle affect their quality?","16393","","<p>I take a number of different medications and herbal supplements.

<p>There's usually some fine powder in the bottom of the bottle, which I assume comes from the broken pills. Other than that, everything appears intact and not misshapen, stuck together, or otherwise compromised. </p>

<p>Is there an overarching rule of thumb for this situation, or would it depend on the specific medications? </p>
","<p>No, this does not alter them, or make them less effective. There are problems with a scant amount of medicine crumbling, as you've noticed.</p>

<p>The only real concern I'd have for anyone doing this is regarding the authorities: for example, while traveling out of the country, it's good to keep your medicines in their original prescription bottles because it supports you're assertion that the medicines are all <em>prescribed</em> to <em>you</em>. In my entire life, I had only one border agent question my medications. So even there, it's rare.</p>

<p>As long as you can tell which pill is which, this is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>One way to decrease crumbling of a pill is to put a piece of cotton in your container, so that when you close it, the pills don't rattle around in your purse. That's the reason many medications come with a cotton ball stuffed into the bottle.</p>

"How does the stomach handle liquid vs solid food?","16286","","<p>I've read the the stomach must secrete HCl and pepsin to break down food. If I have an empty stomach, then drink a large amount of liquid, I wonder if the liquid passes quickly, or gets processed in the same amount of time as solid food.</p>

<p>So how does the stomach handle an environment of pure liquid, versus an environment of solid foods.</p>
","<h1>More stuff = More time</h1>

<p>The stomach has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach#Stomach_as_nutrition_sensor"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>sensory capabilities</strong></a> that help determine the nutritional content of what it receives. This allows it to ""taste"" and decide what it needs to add to the ""stirring pot"" to get cooking. When the stomach receives traditional foods like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, it adds protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCL) to break down the nutrients for absorption in the intestines. </p>

<p>(This is why we consume <a href=""http://www.uhs.wisc.edu/health-topics/digestive-system/upset-stomach.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">fluids and light carbs on an upset stomach</a>- we want to prevent the stomach from getting aggravated and overworked or even inflamed.)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=275"" rel=""nofollow"">more complex the food, the longer it stays in the stomach.</a> So protein can take hours while simple carbohydrates like white bread or sugar could take just half an hour or less. Liquids like tea, juice, and alcohol tend to be even less complicated, water least of all- <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997675"" rel=""nofollow"">taking possibly just minutes to start</a> passing into the blood stream if there is no food in the stomach and fully entering the blood stream within 1-2 hours.</p>

<p>If there happens to be food already in the stomach, the liquid must wait until the stomach finishes digesting the food to enter the small intestine along with the broken-down food. This is why health centers often advise alcohol consumption with food. <a href=""http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/alcohol,_tobacco,_&amp;_other_drugs/alcohol/alcohol_&amp;_your_body.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Food will slow the emptying of the stomach into the small intestine, where alcohol absorption is very rapid.</a></p>

"Accidentally took cold medicine an hour early","16248","","<p>So I currently have a cold and the medicine I'm taking is supposed to be taken every 4 hours. For some reason I thought I was supposed to take my next dose at 3pm, but after I took it, I realized I was actually supposed to take it at 4pm.</p>

<p><strong>Active Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>650mg Acetaminophen</li>
<li>25 mg Diphenhydramine HCl</li>
<li>10mg Phenylephrine HCl </li>
</ul>

<p>Is it probable that this medication, taken regularly in described regimen, would cause side effects such as liver problems or nose bleeds, if one dose was taken an hour too early?</p>
","<p>The main concern here is whether you took more than a recommended daily and more than a recommended single dose. That being said, people are different (in body mass, metabolism, health status etc.), so we can talk about probabilities, but not give a definite answer if something will happen.</p>

<p>The doses for acetaminophene (paracetamol): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The usual adult dose by mouth is 0.5 to 1 g every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 g daily</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The doses for dyphenhydramine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most indications, diphenhydramine hydrochloride is given by mouth in usual doses of 25 to 50 mg three or four times daily</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For phenylephrine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For nasal congestion [...] phenylephrine hydrochloride may be given by mouth in doses up to 20 mg every four hours. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are taking the medicine every 4 hours that's 6 times a day. You can see that by taking the medication one hour earlier <strong>once</strong> does not push your dose over the recommended limits. However, as I said, everyone is different and <strong>should you notice any symptoms or side effects you should contact your healthcare provider</strong>. Also, if you have any questions about your therapy your doctor and/or pharmacist are the best person to ask.</p>

<p>That being said: are these doses recommended by a doctor, or have you decided to take the medicine every 4 hours yourself? You can see that, with this regimen, your are pushing the doses towards the upper limit, which is not always necessary. These substances are treating the symptoms not the cause of your cold, so if you take less it might affect how you feel, but not the outcome of your treatment. Finally, taking a medicine every four hours disrupts your sleep, which might not be the best idea, especially when you are ill.</p>

"What does ""sinus rhythm otherwise normal ECG"" mean?","15528","","<p>I just recently made an ECG to be able to participate in a study and I am curious what ""sinus rhythm otherwise normal ECG"" means. Is my sinus rhythm out of order? A doctor will be checking my ECG and decide if I am suitable for the study, but it will take a week or more.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUkdf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUkdf.jpg"" alt=""ECG""></a></p>
","<p>Basically you have a normal ECG reading according to the machine.</p>

<p>Sinus rhythm (<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMsZi60-vKAhUrkIMKHUYPA-UQFgg2MAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783540008699-c2.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-103532-p7109432&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbKBEgA2Y8mt2saLkl2kWn0N9s0Q&amp;bvm=bv.113943665,d.amc"">as explained in the first section of this book chapter</a>) is normal, meaning that the heart is depolarized by a wave starting in the sinus node. That is the first part of the message. It is worth noting, that if your heart rate had been 1 beat per minute less, it would have probably said ""sinus bradycardia"" as a normal heart rate is considered to be 60-100 beats per minute (BPM). Bradycardia is a heart rate below the 60 bpm threshold (50 bpm in some sources) and tachycardia would be a heart rate above 100 (90 in some sources).</p>

<p>The ""otherwise normal"" is boilerplate by the machine. As you can see by <a href=""http://www.nasanmedical.com/pdf/specs/simulg-s.pdf"">this feature sheet</a> for the NASAN Simul-G ECG machine, ""Otherwise normal ECG"" is one of the display options. Speaking as a programmer, it's a little bit of a shortcut, so that if there is a rhythm problem but everything else is good, they can simply put ""<em>[rhythm message here]</em> otherwise normal ECG"". Better programming would be to omit the ""otherwise"" when the sinus rhythm is normal.</p>

<p>Now, realize that the machine is simply applying preformatted parameters, and that when it says normal, it just means that your readings fit into what it has defined as normal. It is possible that there is some small thing that doesn't look out of place to the machine but would to a trained cardiologist. I don't say that to alarm you, but just to show you how the machine interprets it.</p>

"Is hydrogen peroxide therapy (drinking it) safe?","14272","","<p>I've found <a href=""http://drinkh2o2.com/#hydrogen-peroxide-therapy"">some sites</a> which claim that drinking hydrogen peroxide is ""very"" healthy for detoxification of the body. But these sites lack credible references.</p>

<p>As far as I remember from secondary school, oxygen is very reactive and can cause lungs cancer. I was searching for publications about ""hydrogen peroxide therapy"", but I haven't found anything. I also searched <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"">here on NCBI</a> &mdash; Is that a reliable place for searching such topics?</p>

<p>Is it safe to drink hydrogen peroxide according as these sites claim? Are there any more-credible publications about it?</p>
","<p>Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), especially very high strength H2O2, can be very dangerous and can cause some serious health risks and possibly even death. </p>

<p>A United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement made in 2006<sup><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108701.htm"">1</a></sup> says that drinking high strength H2O2, specifically H2O2 of 35%, is extremely dangerous and can cause several serious side effects. ""Ingesting hydrogen peroxide can cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration."" It can also cause other health risks, some of which can be life threatening. </p>

<p>Another article from 2007<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658134/"">2</a></sup> talks about a specific incident in which a 39 year old man accidentally drank 250mL of 35% H2O2. Though the man did not experience the worst possible side effects, he did have to go to the hospital and he did experience damage in his stomach. This is a good example of a real life situation in which H2O2 was consumed, and it did not turn out well. Another real world example<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692088"">3</a></sup> turned out much sadder. A 2 year old girl swallowed two sips of 35% H2O2 and died. This happened because of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"">cytotoxic</a> (cell-killing) injury in the tissues and formation of oxygen gas (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity"">oxygen toxicity</a>) caused by the H2O2.</p>

<p>Ingestion of 35% H2O2 is undeniably dangerous, but what about lower concentrations of H2O2, such as 3%? A study from the 1990's<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8667471"">4</a></sup> studied 670 cases of mostly children being exposed, usually orally, to 3% H2O2. ""Exposure to hydrogen peroxide 3% is usually benign, however, severe gastric injury may occur following small ingestions in children."" Overall, they found that a majority of the children were not affected by the low concentration H2O2, but there were special cases in which bad outcomes did occur. </p>

<p>Overall, we can see that safeness of drinking H2O2 varies depending on what the concentration is. High concentrations, 35%, are extremely dangerous and should never be consumed, but low concentrations, 3%, present low risks. Now, the question is do the benefits of 3% H2O2 outweigh the risks. </p>

<p>I have been unable to find any reliable sources showing that health benefits of drinking H2O2 of any concentration. Usually, it is used as a topical solution for minor cuts and wounds, not as something to be taken orally. Though the ingestion of 3% H2O2 hasn't been shown to be consistently dangerous, there have been cases of damage in the stomach and other parts of the body.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16740449"">5</a></sup> H2O2 poisoning can be very dangerous, even with low concentrations of it, so I would not recommend drinkin H2O2, ever.

"Why not induce vomiting after accidental pills intake?","12754","","<p>I've read that one should not induce vomiting after an overdose of pills. The only reasonable explanation I found is that</p>

<ul>
<li>caustic substances may damage the esophagus (does not apply here)</li>
<li>the vomit may be aspired in the lungs</li>
</ul>

<p>While the second reason may make sense I'm guessing that the danger is likely to be greater from the pills rather than a not-so-obvious vomit into the lungs. This is certainly possible, but remote.</p>

<p>Is that the sole reason for this warning?</p>
","<p>TL;DR: The only time you should induce vomiting is if the patient is showing no signs or symptoms and you are directed to by poison control or EMS dispatch.</p>

<p>If you have a pill overdose situation and there are any complications such as altered level of consciousness, difficulty breathing, etc., then you want to get emergency medical (EMS) involved immediately. They will want to know such things as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Age of patient</li>
<li>Symptoms</li>
<li>Conscious/breathing?</li>
<li>What drug(s) were taken (Locate bottles if possible, but don't delay the call to do so)</li>
<li>Alcohol or multiple drugs involved</li>
<li>How much was taken (if known)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the person involved is not showing any signs/symptoms yet, then you could possibly call poison control first. They will also want to know most of the same information.</p>

<p>In some cases where the patient is not showing any symptoms, they may have you try to induce vomiting. The generally recommended method is syrup of ipecac, and if that is not available, then take the person to the nearest ER. You don't want to try to induce by shoving things down their throat. That can cause damage to both you and the patient. If they want you to induce, they will tell you.</p>

<p>Also, speaking from a previous EMS/ER background, if they pump the stomach and/or induce vomiting, they will try and see if they can identify what was taken in the stomach contents that come up. If the person you are with vomits, it would help to try and gather the contents to take with you.</p>

","<p>I believe that those lines are craze lines. <strong>""Craze lines are merely cracks in the enamel that do not extend into the dentin.""</strong> They occur because of stress in your teeth, ie: grinding your teeth, biting your nails, and even routine use of your teeth. What you've said also matches up with craze lines in that you don't experience any pain. Those craze lines aren't nearly as bad as some other teeth. Craze lines rarely lead to tooth breakdown, so you almost definitely won't have to get them replaced. There are some studies that say that craze lines may be spots where cavities can form, but these potential problems can be easily detected by dentists.</p>

"How dangerous is it to eat the worms inside fruits?","11972","","<p>because I have diabetes, I try to have more dried fruits instead of cookies, and one of my recent favorites is dried figs.  I buy them from Costco.  Today I came across this page on Amazon on the same product.  <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004LWJFFY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/Made-Nature-Organic-Calimyrna-40-Ounce/dp/B004LWJFFY</a>
I was surprised by the negative reviews, and it turns out that apparently some of these figs contain dead worms!  Or as the second most helpful review called them, maggots.</p>

<p>It freaked me out!  I'm a very picky eater and don't even like seafood, so forget about anything exotic as eating worms! I got nauseous thinking about it and the fact that I've had these for several months now, and went and dissected a few of the figs but could not see anything like that.  Apparently they're fairly small and also hard to distinguish from the inner pulp of the fig.</p>

<p>While reading the comments I saw some angry discussion between some commentators about it, some saying that this is the norm and most fruits naturally dried have things like that inside them and alternative would be using pesticide and ingesting chemicals.  That the US government allows some minimal level of things like that inside the food that we consume.  Of course the other side was saying that this is wrong and dangerous.</p>

<p>I'm confused by all this and hope that some nutritionist or someone with specialty in this area can help me make sense of this.  Thank you very much. </p>
","<p><strong>Fruits (both fresh and dried) should not contain bugs.</strong> Their presence indicates that the fruit hasn't been preserved well, or that their producer has made some other mistake.  They may be unsafe to eat.</p>

<p>If you're in any doubt, dispose of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, let's talk in some more detail about figs, because I also love figs, and because they have a special relationship with bugs.</p>

<p>Figs you want to eat should not contain bugs either.  However, if you pick the fig yourself, or if the grower who sold it to you was incompetent, you may one day open an undamaged fresh fruit of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"" rel=""nofollow"">fig tree</a> and find little critters.  Those are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_wasp"" rel=""nofollow"">fig wasps</a>, or larvae thereof.  They are about 2mm long and a normal part of the lifecycle of figs, and render the fruit inedible.  However, they are completely avoidable by growers who know what they're doing.</p>

<p>Each fig species has a unique symbiotic reproductive relationship with a species of fig wasp.  The wasps pollinate the plants, and hermaphroditic plants (only some of all figs) produce flowers that wasps can also lay eggs in.</p>

<p>We can however guarantee no bugs if we choose to pick only from plants that are—</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocarpy"" rel=""nofollow"">parthenocarpic</a>, which produce mature fruit even when not pollinated, as long as they are in an area without wasps that could pollinate them, or</p></li>
<li><p>a gynodioecious species' female trees, in which flowers are shaped such that while wasps can pollinate them, they cannot lay eggs there.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think the grower of those suspicious dried figs you linked (with many negative Amazon reviews) must have made a mistake of either—</p>

<ul>
<li><p>growing a parthenocarpic fig species in an area that <em>has</em> wasps of the species that pollinates it, or</p></li>
<li><p>misplacing their female trees, and accidentally picking from a hermaphroditic tree.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or perhaps they had just stored the fruit badly and the bugs that reviewers found were unrelated.  Either way, it's a shame this supplier is giving dried fruit a bad name.  I'm convinced they are the exception, as that is the first case I've heard of, and certainly not the way fruit should be.</p>

"Difference between TENS and EMS electro stimulation?","11933","","<p>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) are described by product manufacturers (and wikipedia!) as two separate things.</p>

<p>However, I have been unable to find a concise/complete description what is actually different, such as 1) voltage, 2) current, 3) frequency, 4) wave form, 5) location applied on body, ...</p>

<p>Can somebody clarify?</p>
","<p>As you read, both TENS and EMS employ electrotherapy to treat acute and chronic pain, but the methodology differs. (Note that some of the references are to NMES, which stands for Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation, and is considered synonymous with EMS.)</p>

<p>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS) use electrotherapy to <a href=""http://www.tensunitreviews.net/tens-vs-ems/"">stimulate the nerves</a> and active therapeutic healing. Electronic Muscle Stimulators (EMS), on the other hand, sends electric impulses that cause <a href=""http://www.tensunitreviews.net/tens-vs-ems/"">muscle contraction</a>. EMS units are used to prevent atrophied muscles, for retraining muscles (e.g. in partial paralysis), to increase range of motion, and other uses. </p>

<p>Some of the technology is described <a href=""http://www.tensunitreviews.net/tens-vs-ems/"">here</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A TENS unit uses microcurrent to increase the production of ATP, which is adenosine triphosphate and the substance that supplies energy to the body on a cellular level. Although lasting pain reduction may require regular microcurrent sessions, in some individuals the pain reduction begins to last longer and the time between sessions lengthens. This may be due to the increased circulatory action that enables the lymph system to begin clearing the body of accumulated toxins. The sensations of both the microcurrent and conventional TENS treatments are more like tingling sensations than the unpleasant feeling of a small electrical shock.</p>
  
  <p>EMS uses a cycle of stimulation, contraction and then relaxation, to increase blood flow to the area, which decreases inflammation and promotes healing and muscle growth. By stimulating the muscles at their basic structure, an EMS unit causes muscle contractions similar to those obtained by exercise. The EMS units are specifically used to prevent atrophied muscles or for retraining muscles, such as in an individual who has been paralyzed or partially paralyzed. In addition, EMS is used for many other applications such as range of motion improvement, increased circulatory action and the prevention of blood clots. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both types of therapies are convenient, in that they're used at home, and the patient controls the dose, generally by way of either a knob or a switch. Electrodes are user-replaceable, though placement instructions are given and monitored by a physician or physical therapist. TENS units also have a ""burst"" feature, enabling the patient intermittent increases, which is helpful after strenuous activity or if you're just having a bad day. I personally found that feature very helpful!</p>

<p>A Yale University study entitled <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375668/"">Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for Skeletal Muscle Function</a>(Yale J Biol Med. 2012) discussing electrical stimulation (ES), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and functional electrical stimulation (FES) states that the potential that electrical stimulation holds for rehabilitation recovery is immeasurable. It is used to improve muscle strength, increase range of motion, reduce edema, decrease atrophy, heal tissue, and decrease pain. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), used interchangeably with electrical stimulation (ES), is typically provided at higher frequencies (20-50 Hz) expressly to produce muscle tetany and contraction that can be used for “functional” purposes and can be found in literature as early as 1964. TENS is an alternate form of electrical stimulation that historically used high frequencies for pain relief but is now also administered at very low frequencies (sensory level TENS, 2-10 Hz). <em>TENS propagates along smaller afferent sensory fibers specifically to override pain impulses.</em> When very low frequencies are used, TENS specifically targets sensory nerve fibers and does not activate motor fibers; therefore, no discernible muscle contraction is produced.</p>
</blockquote>

","<p>It is actually a pretty common myth that crossing your eyes too much or for too long  will make them get stuck that way. Crossing your eyes does look very similar to <a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001004.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">strabismus</a> which is an actual medical disorder where the eyes are crossed and it does need to be treated.

<p><strong>Why doesn't crossing your eyes cause any damage?</strong></p>

<p>Now, that I've gone over the what, I'll go over the why. Many times throughout the day, you will cross your eyes on purpose, but won't actually think of it as crossing your eyes. Crossing your eyes is the natural reaction to looking at something very close to your face. We need to angle our eyes so we can see objects clearly at a close range. This is essentially the same exact movement you would make when crossing your eyes. Our eyes are designed to be able to move up, down, left, and right, and, while it may not seem like the most natural eye movement, crossing your eyes voluntarily is completely normal.</p>

<p>There is a potential for temporary disorientation, pain, or possible blurring if you cross your eyes for too long, but it would only last a short amount of time. This is because you would be putting more strain on the muscles in your eyes, in this case it would mostly be your <a href=""http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/medial-rectus-muscle"" rel=""nofollow"">medial rectus muscles</a>.

<p>Furthermore, there is the risk of mercury that is harmful to the body, <a href=""https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-09-16-proof-flu-shuts-are-the-greatest-medical-fraud-in-the-history-of-the-world.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">according to <em>Natural News</em></a>.</p>

<p>Does it make sense for a healthy male in his early 40s to take the influenza vaccine, particularly when flu is an irritant but nowhere near deadly? Flu jabs come with mercury danger and does not sound effective. I am a lay man, so I may have miss out something important. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
","<p>In general, the benefit of flu shots is to the general population. Taking the cited value of 40%-60% from the CDC, we can say that it might be a coin toss for you <em>personally</em> to be protected from influenza by the shot. However, if many thousands of people take the flu shot, even if it only works on 40% of them, it helps protect the remaining population from the spread of the virus (AKA herd immunity). This is especially important to those within the population who cannot access the shot or cannot receive it due to a preexisting medical condition. As Graham Chiu's answer points out, influenza is no joke, especially for vulnerable members of the population (such as the elderly or people with certain medical conditions).</p>

<p>With regards to mercury in the flu shot, the specific additive is called ""Thimerosal"". Firstly: <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/thimerosal.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">not all flu shots contain Thimerosal</a>. If you feel strongly about it, ask your pharmacist for a vaccine that doesn't contain Thimerosal. The additive is a <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">preservative</a> to prevent bacteria or fungi from growing in multi-dose vials containing the influenza vaccine. For explanations as to why you don't need to worry about Thimerosal, see the <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15070/12655"">other</a> great <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15074/12655"">answers</a> below.</p>

<p>Some further information to put your mind at ease. In their <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/straight-talk-about-vaccination/"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a> in Scientific American, Matthew F. Daly and Jason M. Glanz (a pediatrician and epidemiologist respectively at Kaiser Permanente's Institute for Health Research in Denver) have this to say about the safety of vaccines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because vaccines are given to huge numbers of people, including healthy infants, they are held to a much higher safety standard than medications used for people who are already sick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the same article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key facts [you] need to know, though, are that vaccines prevent potentially fatal diseases, that vaccines have a high degree of safety, and that their safety is constantly evaluated and reevaluated in a system operating independently from the pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a final note: in that article shared by the OP there are several scientifically unsound arguments and factual errors. I'm not going through the effort of refuting them all here. It is however worth pointing out that the presence of Thimerosal in vaccines is not a secret, and is well known among the scientific and medical community. In a <strong>brief</strong> search of medical literature in the medical science database <em><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PubMed.gov</a></em> (free to the public, by the way) with the search terms ""influenza vaccine safety"" I could find no results making any claims about adverse side effects due to Thimerosal. In a database containing literally millions of independent, peer-reviewed medical scientific publications, you will be hard pressed to find any supporting the claims made in the aforementioned article shared by the OP.</p>

<p>In fact, this <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2017.1423153"" rel=""noreferrer"">review article</a> (where researchers summarize the results of 190 other sources on vaccine safety) had this to say on the topic of vaccine safety [paraphrased by me]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Influenza causes substantial death, suffering and socioeconomic impact worldwide.</li>
  <li>Vaccination is the best defense against influenza.</li>
  <li>Influenza vaccines are ""very safe"".</li>
  <li>The only known side effects of influenza vaccines are temporary nasal congestion (runny nose) and sometimes allergic reactions.</li>
  <li>Allergic reactions appear in less than 1 out of every 1,000,000 doses.</li>
  <li>Children with asthma under the age of 2 are particularly susceptible to the side effects of the influenza vaccine and more study is required to ensure it's safety for this particular high-risk group.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, infants who have problems breathing might be more significantly affected by allergic reactions or congestion. That's all they have to say about flu vaccine side effects (regardless of whether they contain Thimerosal). Finally, a direct quote from the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vaccines have to meet higher safety standards, since they are administered to healthy people, mainly healthy children. The monitoring of annual influenza vaccine safety, which is particular [sic] important on account of the annual changes in the viral antigen composition of the vaccine, constitutes a critical component of the influenza vaccination program. Indeed, not only does this strategy ensure the safety of vaccines, it can also maintain public trust in the national vaccination program.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What has hot shower to do with low blood pressure?</p>
","<p>When the body is exposed to hot temperatures, the normal response of the body is  dilation of the peripheral blood vessels so that the heat energy in the blood can be released into the external environment, increasing the rate at which the body cools down.</p>

<p>This dilatation also leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance (blood pooling in the extremities, for instance), and thus a decrease in blood pressure.  Thus if one already suffers from low blood pressure, exposure to hot environments may temporarily exacerbate the problem.</p>

"What disorder would cause sweating to appear only on one half of the face?","8906","","<p>Or a more detailed question, what would cause a vertical divide (through the center of the nose) of the face, where one half has normal sweat gland function and another does not? There are no motor or sensory deficiencies otherwise.</p>

<p>When excercising, only the half with normal functions blushes, which would lead me to think it's an innervation or vascular problem. What controls blood circulation and sweat in the specified area (which part of the brain or which nerves carry the commands)?</p>
","<p>There are a number of possibilities, from benign to serious.</p>

<p>Sweating is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, as is vasodilation (facial redness). Anhydrosis of only one side of the face would be due dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve (which also carries sensory and motor components) on that side of the face. The trigeminal nerve can lose function for many reasons, but rarely does it lose only <em>one</em> of it's functions (i.e. the physical exam should help here.) </p>

<p>Ross syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by segmental an-/hypohydrosis, pupil irregularity (called Adie's pupil), and diminished deep tendon reflexes.</p>

<p>Harlequin syndrome is another possibility.</p>

<p>Horner's syndrome is the broad term for the decreased sympathetic nerve function, and, again, involves more than anhydrosis. It is characterized by the triad of miosis (constricted pupil), partial ptosis, and loss of hemifacial sweating. Horner's is not rare per se, and can occur alone or with a number of illnesses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Horner syndrome can be congenital, acquired, or purely hereditary (autosomal dominant). The interruption of the sympathetic fibers may occur centrally (ie, between the hypothalamus and the fibers’ point of exit from the spinal cord [C8 to T2]) or peripherally (ie, in cervical sympathetic chain, at the superior cervical ganglion, or along the carotid artery).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Serious disorders should be ruled out, e.g. internal carotid artery dissection (not always symptomatic), malignancies anywhere from central nervous system/trigeminal/apical lung/etc., other causes of carotid ischemia, etc. Since the differential of Horner's Syndrome is large and it is a neurological problem, a neurologist is probably the best bet for a diagnosis here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although Horner syndrome is commonly an incidental finding related to a benign cause, it occasionally may be a manifestation of a serious and life-threatening disorder. Careful direction of the history to rule out such life-threatening disorders is vital.</p>

"Effects of X-rays on the human body","8440","","<p>What is the maximum number of times a person can safely undergo x-ray scanning?  If this limit is exceeded, are there serious and/or life threatening side effects that the person may experience?</p>
","<p>A person should undergo Xrays as often an they are <em>necessary</em>, because the risk-to-benefit ratio is usually very far in favor of the benefit.</p>

<p>As an example of this idea of risk-to-benefit ratio, lets take getting into a car.</p>

<p>There is <strong>always</strong> a risk to getting into a car. After all, they move quickly, slide on slippery roads, and hurl towards (and potentially <em>at</em>) each other at a frightening rate of speed. You probably know someone who died in a car accident. Yet, probably without giving it a single thought - except when you're buckling your seat belt - you get into a car several times per day/week. Because the benefit (distance transportation, convenience) is higher than the risk of injury in a motor vehicle accident (this example is actually flawed, but we'll ignore that for the moment.)</p>

<p>Similarly, there is <strong>always</strong> a risk to getting an xray, but sometimes you just have to get them. The risk is low compared to the benefit. You wouldn't want anyone putting you in a cast without knowing what kind of bone fracture you had, because some kinds need to be casted differently, some need to be casted longer, some need operative repair, and some only need a splint. The benefit outweighs the risk.</p>

<p>There is no completely safe lower limit of radiation. Radiation (especially in fetuses and children) increases the likelihood of cancer. Our information comes mostly from atomic bomb survivors, people exposed at Chernobyl (nuclear reactor accidents), people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of background radiation, e.g. uranium miners.</p>

<p>Radiation doses are measured in <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/radiation/understand/perspective.html"" rel=""nofollow"">millisieverts</a> (mSv). For comparison's sake, you should know that, depending on where you live, </p>

<ul>
<li>natural background radiation exposure accounts for an average of <strong>3.1 mSv/yr</strong></li>
<li>A seven hour airplane trip exposes you to <strong>0.02 mSv</strong> of radiation per trip</li>
<li>Backscatter Wave Scanners in airports exposure is just less than 0.0001 mSv per scan (so one average year exposes you to 31,000 times as much radiation as an airport scanner.)</li>
<li>a four bite-wing dental series is about 0.005 mSv</li>
<li>a two view Chest X Ray doses you 0.1 mSv</li>
<li>your average CT scan is going to give you 7 mSv of exposure </li>
</ul>

<p>Is that safe? What is your chance of getting a lethal cancer from that? The answer is: no one knows. It depends on a lot of unmeasurable things: genetics, your age, your ability to repair the damage, which area of the body is being dosed, whether there are other carcinogens at work (e.g. viruses or co-carcinogens), etc.</p>

<p>The following all give you a (estimated) <em>1 in a million</em> chance of dying from that event:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Smoking 1.4 cigarettes (lung cancer)</li>
  <li>Eating 40 tablespoons of peanut butter</li>
  <li>Spending 2 days in New York City (air pollution)</li>
  <li>Driving 40 miles in a car (accident)</li>
  <li>Flying 2500 miles in a jet (accident)</li>
  <li>Canoeing for 6 minutes</li>
  <li>Receiving 10 mrem (.1 mSv) of radiation (cancer)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you can estimate that (maybe) the risk of dying from a 7 mSv CT scan is about equivalent to driving 2800 miles.</p>

<p>Taken individually: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the maximum number of times a person can undergo x-ray scanning? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As often as necessary. As long as the benefit outweighs the risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is their a maximum limit? If so, what are the side effects that the person will be subjected to if he undergoes x-ray scanning more number of times?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there's no maximum limit. The risk is cancer. The risk is low, but not negligible. It doesn't go up linearly with every Xray study you have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are they life threatening and do they have long term effects on the body of the person?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes; cancers are often life threatening.</p>

<p>What can you do about it?</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't ask your doctor for an unnecessary Xray.</li>
<li>Ask your doctor if an Xray they ordered is necessary (sometimes they are ordered to reassure the patient - or their parents, in the case of head injury - that nothing is wrong.) A doctor worth their salt will respect you for asking. Sometimes it's ok to take a ""wait-and-see"" approach. Sprained ankles meeting certain criteria never need an Xray. It's ok to ask.
_ If your doctor orders a CT scan of something, ask if an MRI would be better. (They cost more, and are sometimes as good or better than a CT scan.)</li>
<li>wear a shield when offered (will shield the parts of your body they don't need to see.</li>
<li>ask about the age of the machine (newer machines often use lower dosages than older ones (post 2005 is better).</li>

"how many 'lives' are saved from one donation of blood?","7801","","<p>The red cross claims that donating blood can 'save up to three lives'  That seems a highly exaggerated best case scenario.  I'm curious, how many lives are really saved from a unit of blood?  Specifically, what is the odds of one pint of whole blood producing a product which will be used to successfully treat an otherwise fatal injury/illness etc, and that if the donor had not donated that pint a death would have occurred due to lack of sufficient supplies, or being forced to use fewer resources of less computable ones?</p>

<p>What I would love is the ability to do get as nuanced and exact numbers as possible, as part of the motivation of this question is to have the numbers needed to address another question on Skeptics.  If an answer doesn't want to do the exact math pointing me to the resources I need for me to do the math would be fine as well; but I don't even know what products are produced from a whole blood donation much less how to calculate the benefit of any one of those products.</p>

<p>I know that blood type of the donor could play a factor here, but to address the question I'm interested in I'd prefer to know about the 'average' pint of blood, so in essence if all the donor of all the varous blood types in the US donated and you averaged all those various pings of different types together what would the average pint do?</p>

<p>Of course being B+ myself I would be personally curious to know what the B+ blood type does, it would be cool to calculate a 'statistical lives saved' ratio for myself :)</p>
","<p>I think your skepticism may come from not understanding the process behind the claim.  </p>

<p>A single unit of blood is separated into 4 main ""blood products"": red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and white blood cells. Another product called cryoprecipitate can be produced from frozen then thawed plasma and is used in special circumstances.  Whole blood is rarely used for transfusions anymore because of problems with transfusion reactions and, quite frankly, except in the case of massive hemorrhage, a single person rarely needs all these components all at once (and even then they probably won't need white blood cells).  Red blood cells (or packed red blood cells) are what most people think of when they get a ""blood transfusion.""  Plasma is given to people who do not have enough clotting factors in their blood to stop bleeding that is currently occurring or if it should occur.  Platelets are given to people who are not producing enough platelets to keep them from bleeding to death.  White blood cells are rarely given anymore, but there may be occasion to use them in specific cases.</p>

<p>Now did that one unit save up to 3 lives?  Well, to answer that the question of whether their lives were in danger to begin with has to be answered.  The answer is, ""Yes!""  When will they die without the product?  For some it's in the next several minutes, for others it may be hours, days or weeks, but in every case these peoples lives are in danger without the products derived from human blood.</p>

<p>But did that unit all by itself achieve this? No, but in concert with the donations of others it <strong>contributed</strong> to saving ""up to 3 lives."" Because doctors try avoid using precious blood products until it is absolutely necessary by treating patients with other methods if possible, so by the time a person definitely requires blood products, they will get more than one unit, but had they been given products earlier without giving the 'other methods' a chance to work they would have needed just as much, maybe more, over time.</p>

<p>The American Cancer Society has an excellent <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/bloodproductdonationandtransfusion/blood-transfusion-and-donation-types-of-transfusions"" rel=""noreferrer"">summary of types of blood transfusions and what they are used for here</a>. </p>

<p>I don't think the claim is derived from any particular set of statistics or the hard and fast numbers that you are seeking, but from the process involved.</p>

"What causes sudden stabbing back pain?","7687","","<p>Many of us will have experienced a sudden intense back pain, often caused just by turning sharply or reaching for something rather than anything physically arduous. The pain gradually diminishes over the course of a few days and doesn't recur. I have Googled for information on this, but back pain is such an extensive area it's hard to make sense of the flood of information. A common theme seems to be <em>muscle spasm</em>, but comments about this tend to be vague.</p>

<p>So my question is: assuming there is no underlying medical condition, like a slipped disk, what exactly goes on when you experience this apparently random intense back pain?</p>
","<p>The causes of such pains are called back strains, and may be muscular or ligamentous in origin.</p>

<p>It may be caused by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Physical exertion</li>
<li>Fall</li>
<li>Bending repeatedly</li>
<li>Lifting heavy objects</li>
<li>Emotional Stress</li>
<li>Sitting in improper postures for long periods of time</li>
</ol>

<p>This happens when a muscle/ligament is overstretched, resulting in the injury of the same. Since spine is essentially supported by a large number of muscles and ligaments, this can happen very easily. If there is an injury, the area around it gets inflamed, and these will lead to spasm of the muscles. Hence the movement of the spine in such conditions will be extremely painful.</p>

<p>The treatment modalities are usually conservative, including rest, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and physiotherapy when needed.</p>

<p>If someone drinks their only water source once a day, I imagine the body will metabolise or otherwise use all the water nutrients right away and dispose of the rest. I do not have any evidence to back up my claims, but this seems like a gross misinterpretation of health guidelines and their body will be wanting water later in the day.</p>

<p>Anybody seen any articles that set quotas on drinking frequency?</p>
","<p>Referring to published <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/"">research</a>, there is no known quota on drinking frequency since fluid intake from beverages and food in time period takes care of the total hydration status of an individual in a day. Daily consumption below the range of adequate intake of water may not produce harmful effects to the body because hydration is received from intake of beverages and foods other than the normal water intake.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6#74"">Research</a> into hydration reveals humans must maintain water balance in order to stay healthy. Humans receive hydration i.e. water from daily food and water intake, and generally lose water in the form of sweat, urine and exhalation. Drinking water is beneficial in those with a water deficit particularly due to dehydration which can be caused by other factors such as diarrhea, vomiting, burns etc.</p>

"How can doctors remove a stye without damaging the eyeball?","7308","","<p>I had a stye, and a doctor used a needle to remove it.  The procedure was simple and didn't even cause any bleeding.  How is this possible?</p>
","<h1>What is a stye?</h1>

<p>A <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye"">stye</a> is an infection of the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland_of_Zeis"">sebaceous glands</a> at the base of the eyelashes or the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glands_of_Moll"">apocrine sweat glands</a> on the margin of the eyelid.  Styes are caused by the gland becoming blocked by cell debris or sebum, a natural oil produced by the body.  The stye generally appears on the interior or margin of the eyelid as a small whitish colored protrusion, similar to a whitehead.  They can be quite painful and irritating, but they usually don't cause significant problems, and it is easy to get rid of them.  </p>

<h1>How are styes treated?</h1>

<p>There are several ways to remove styes, the most common being the repeated application of a topical antibiotic ointment several times a day for a period of two weeks.  </p>

<p>However, they can also be treated surgically by <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancing_(surgical_procedure)"">lancing</a>, which is the treatment you seem to have received.   This is a very minor procedure, <a href=""http://www.emedicinehealth.com/sty/page11_em.htm"">and is performed as follows</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The doctor will probably apply a small amount of antiseptic to the affected area;  if the stye is located on the inner eyelid, the eyelid will be pulled back to expose the stye.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a sharp needle, the doctor will pierce the stye, a procedure known as ""lancing"".  </p></li>
<li><p>The doctor may apply pressure to encourage the stye to drain;  the liquid that is released is a mixture of pus and previously blocked sebum.  </p></li>
<li><p>The doctor may choose to apply an antibiotic ointment to the area.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>How can doctors do this without damaging the eye?</h1>

<p>Doctors are professionals, and any ophthalmologist is likely to have performed the procedure countless times before.  The stye isn't actually on the eyeball itself, but on the eyelid.

"How many times a week is masturbating good for health?","6955","","<p>I'm 18 years old.<br>
Every weekend I see a pornographic film and when it finishes, I do to hand job.<br>
In addition, on weekdays, I masturbate.<br>
My question is : <strong>it is good for health or not</strong>?</p>
","<h2>Let's get a few things out of the way...</h2>

<p>Sex is normal (<a href=""http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29678-2_5370"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a>). Sexual desire and arousal are normal (<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160217-what-is-a-normal-sex-life"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a>). Asexuality is normal (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3965446/"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a>). Masturbation is normal (<a href=""http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-306-48113-0_261"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a>),(<a href=""http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1695-2_565"" rel=""noreferrer"">5</a>). There is no problem whatsoever with these three things, although everyone blushes when they talk about them. </p>

<h2>Is Masturbation healthy?</h2>

<p><strong>Downsides</strong>:  </p>

<p>Masturbation is not risk free. It is about as dangerous as <em>chewing or walking</em> (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/men/guide/male-masturbation-5-things-you-didnt-know#1"" rel=""noreferrer"">6</a>). Some side effects are irritated skin and ruptured penis, but only if you really, really, really overdo it (7).</p>

<p><strong>Upsides</strong>: </p>

<p>While masturbation does not have the health benefits sex has (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/men/guide/male-masturbation-5-things-you-didnt-know#1"" rel=""noreferrer"">6</a>), there are some advantages to it:   </p>

<p>a) You get to know how your penis/vagina works. This will greatly benefit you when having sexual intercourse!  </p>

<p>b) Masturbation can help you relax and improve your mood; it won't resolve clinical depression but it can help you feel better if you're having a bad day, and it can help you forget about stressful events of the day and improve sleep.  </p>

<p>c) Masturbating can provide pain relief. Reports indicate that masturbation can help relieve menstrual cramps.</p>

<p>d) Masturbation can help strengthen muscle tone in the pelvic and anal areas, which can reduce the chances of incontinence and uterine prolapse. (<a href=""http://www.webmd.boots.com/sex-relationships/guide/women-masturbation"" rel=""noreferrer"">8</a>)</p>

<p>e) Masturbating men are less likely to develop prostate cancer. (<a href=""http://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/health-and-sexual-benefits-of-masturbation"" rel=""noreferrer"">9</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Unless it <em>hurts</em> and <em>as long as you are comfortable with it and feel the desire</em>, masturbation is actually a good thing.</p>

<h2>How much is too much?</h2>

<p>As pointed out before, one can overdo it. 
This article (<a href=""http://sexuality.about.com/od/masturbation/a/masturbation1.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">10</a>) sums everything up quite neatly though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no amount of masturbation that is healthy or unhealthy. Masturbation isn’t like candy or eggs, there isn’t a ""recommended daily allowance"", it means different things to different people, and we all use masturbation differently, in positive and negative ways. So this question needs to be answered on an individual basis, keeping in mind that very few of us actually masturbate in ways that are harmful to ourselves or others.</p>
  
  <p>Having said that, there are people whose masturbation is causing them distress and even pain (physical, emotional, psychological), and for those people it may make sense to talk with someone and sort our whether they are masturbating too much or whether they can adjust their feelings about masturbation to allow them to enjoy it more.</p>

"How do extended release tablets work?","6935","","<p>I know these tablets are especially formulated and coated to dissolve over a certain period of time. I also notice that all I've seen, quite a lot, are too large to pass through the Pylorus. Do they remain in the stomach for most of their release period, slowly being dissolved layer by layer, and only release a constantly steady small amount of their payload into the small intestine to be absorbed and go to work on the body or mind?</p>
","<p>Some extended release products do remain in the stomach while the drug is being released but how they remain in the stomach is often not a function of the size of the tablet itself. To help explain I have included some background information about drug formulation. I am referencing the text, Applied Biopharmaceutics &amp; Pharmacokinetics, and my experience as a pharmacy student. </p>

<p>Another term used to describe extended release products is modified release products, this is differentiated from conventional immediate release products. However, even within immediate release formulations, absorption can be slowed due to the drug itself being in an inactive form or if the drug is very lipophilic resulting in slower absorption by the GI tract itself. </p>

<p>Among modified release products, there are several different types of technologies which provide different mechanisms for slowing the release of drugs or altering the drug release mechanism. Some examples of modified release formulations are delayed release (generally include enteric coated), extended release and orally disintegrating.  </p>

<p>Delayed release tablets are sometimes enteric coated. This enteric coat is specifically designed to prevent dissolution of the tablet in the stomach. This is sometimes meant to protect the drug from the acidic environment of the stomach, but also sometimes meant to protect the stomach from the disrupting presence of the drug. </p>

<p>Specifically, extended release refers to a drug formulation where the rate of drug release is engineered by a special coating, membrane infused with the drug, capsule with a special opening, a capsule containing special beads, or difficult to dissolve tablet. Some products use multiple mechanisms to achieve the desired rate of drug release. Referencing your question specifically, there are many drugs that remain in the stomach while the release of the drug takes place but this not true of all extended-release formulations (ex: some drugs are designed to remain in the small intestine). Products that remain in the stomach while the drug is released are known as gastroretentive systems. </p>

<p>There are several designs that have been used to maintain the drug in the stomach. A few of these include but are not limited to high-density systems, floating systems, expandable systems, and mucoadhesive or bioadhesive systems. In the expandable systems, one example being metformin ER, a diabetes drug, the tablet unfolds or expands preventing passage through the pyloric sphincter. These expandable tablets make up only a small portion of gastroretentive products. A more common form being the floating or mucoadhesive systems. In the floating systems, the tablet or capsule is designed to be less dense than the stomach contents and thus remain at the top of the stomach while the drug is released. In the mucoadhesive/bioadhesive formulation, the drug has a special coating that allows it to adhere to the wall of the stomach and prevent it from passing through to the small intestine. </p>

<p>Ultimately there are many technologies that allow for extended release products to function. While the overall concept is the same, how it is achieved can be quite different from drug to drug.</p>

"What would happen if a person used Flea medicine on themselves?","6679","","<p>There are many flea &amp; tick treatments that you just put a few drops on the skin of your pet regularly and keeps them protected. </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"">Lyme Disease</a> is currently problematic in my area. The drops work good for pets, so it seems reasonable they would work just as well on a person.</p>

<p>What would happen if a person used Flea &amp; Tick drops on themselves?  </p>
","<p>Many of the active ingredients in flea and tick powders are harmful to humans, or suspected of being carcinogenic, or have effects on the nervous system.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/flea_tick_OTC_pet_products.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Humane Society</a> has a page on OTC flea and tick products, one of the sections details a couple of these effects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Besides pyrethroid-based products, ingredients to be wary of are organophosphate insecticides (OPs) and carbamates, both of which are found in various flea and tick products.  The only OP currently found in flea and tick products in the U.S. is tetrachlorvinphos.  This chemical is classified by the EPA as being ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans.""  There are questions about the effects of long-term, cumulative exposures as well as combined exposures from the use of other products containing OPs and carbamates.  Permethrin is another chemical that the EPA has classified as ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans"" if ingested orally. </p>
  
  <p>If the ingredient list includes carbaryl or propoxur, the product contains a carbamate.  According to the NRDC, the potential dangers posed by thee products are greatest for children and pets.  Propoxur is considered to be a ""probable human carcinogen"" by the EPA.  As of September 2010, Carbaryl will no longer be permitted for use in new pet products.  However, existing stock of flea/tick products containing carbaryl can still be sold.  The HSUS recommends that pet products containing carbaryl should be disposed of and not used on pets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, one of the current varieties of powder (<a href=""http://www.petco.com/product/12687/K9-Advantix-II-Dog-Flea-And-Tick-Drops.aspx#"" rel=""nofollow"">K9 Advantix II</a>) has the following warning on it's website for the product:</p>

"Salt as a treatment to gum inflammation","6510","","<p>I had strong pains in the gum. After several months I went to a periodontist. He said I had inflammation in my gums, and then gave me a complex treatment, but the pains remained.</p>

<p>After several more months, I followed advice from my wife, and started treating my mouth with salt. After several days of salting, the pains disappeared!</p>

<p>However, the periodontist still says I have inflammation, and have to go through the treatment again.</p>

<p>Now, I am not sure who to believe... the dentist, or my mouth (and my wife)?</p>

<p>So my question is: can regular salt-washing be a good cure for gum inflammation?</p>
","<p><em>You should thank your wife 1 million times for the cure that she suggested for you.</em></p>

<p>The fact that the pain has gone, is probably related to the type of bacteria that caused the inflammation. Common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), and there are some types of bacteria that cannot tolerate high concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) (These bacteria are called : Non-halophilic bacteria), hence, salt is the perfect way to get rid of non-halophilic bacteria.
In addition, I've been using salt-washing everytime I have toothache, and this works for me.</p>

"When does the use of headphones become harmful?","6211","","<p>Generally, it is known if you listen to music through headphones a lot of time, you damage your ears.</p>

<p>But how long should I use the headphones? And how loud can they be so as not to affect my hearing?</p>
","<p>Using headphones at a sufficiently high volume level may cause cause trauma to cochlear structure in the inner ear which gives rise to temporary or permanent hearing impairment or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss"" rel=""noreferrer"">deafness</a>.</p>

<p>Sound pressure is measured in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"" rel=""noreferrer"">decibels</a> and exposure to 75dB (even after long exposure) are usually safe. However, long or repeated to sounds at above 85dB can cause hearing loss. <strong>The louder the sound, the shorter the amount of time it takes for NIHL to happen.</strong></p>

<p>The risk is higher especially in loud places as volume often needs to compete with the background noise. For example, the average sound level on a busy street is about 80dB. In the Airo study, when the outdoor noise was a mere 65dB, listeners raised headphone volume levels to over 80dB<sup><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19991117210432/http://hearnet.com/text/mainframe.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">1997</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This figure shows the average chosen listening levels for our subjects across the different background noise levels<sup><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080807140756/http://www.hearingconservation.org/docs/virtualPressRoom/FligorIves.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">2006</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/psOnGl.png"" alt=""Average chosen listening level""></p>

<p>When we experience sound in our environment (TV, radio, traffic), normally these sounds are at safe levels, however long period of exposure to high sound pressure levels at high volume can be damaging to sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).</p>

<p>Hearing damage from headphones is probably more common than from loudspeakers, even at comparable volumes, due to the close coupling of the transducers to the ears.</p>

<p>Symptoms of hearing damage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ringing or buzzing in the ears.</li>
<li>Difficulty in understanding speech.</li>
<li>Slight muffling of sounds.</li>
<li>Difficulty understanding speech in noisy places or places with poor acoustics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>The WHO recommends that young people limit the use of personal audio player to one hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise.</p>

<p>NIOSH recommends a safe headphone listening volume of 85dB. Although headphones are not sold with SPL meters, they can be purchased separately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One could note of the volume control setting that pumps out 85dB, any music recorded at a higher level would still play back at dangerous levels. The headphones would have to be recalibrated whenever the music changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While in-the-ear earphones can produce higher sound levels than over-the-ear earphones, they are not necessarily used at higher levels.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrNwl.jpg"" alt=""Maximum listening time per day using NIOSH damage-risk criteria.""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The table above shows NIOSH recommended maximum listening time per day, depending on the style of earphones used and the volume control settings on the player. On this chart, the “Isolator” style refers to earphones that have been reported to block out background noise, and “Supra-Aural” style refers to earphones that sit on top of the ear. The final column shows our measurements for the iPod, using the stock earbuds from Apple.</p>

  <p>Data from studies in middle- and high-income countries analysed by WHO indicate that among teenagers and young adults aged 12-35 years, nearly 50% are exposed to unsafe levels of sound from the use of personal audio devices and around 40% are exposed to potentially damaging levels of sound at entertainment venues. Unsafe levels of sounds can be, for example, exposure to in excess of 85 decibels (dB) for eight hours or 100 dB for 15 minutes. </p>
  
  <p>Teenagers and young people can better protect their hearing by keeping the volume down on personal audio devices, wearing earplugs when visiting noisy venues, and using carefully fitted, and, if possible, noise-cancelling earphones/headphones.

"Can a sunburn increase your resting heart rate?","6204","","<p>I've been using a Fitbit to track my resting heartrate (among other things).  The value has consistently been in the 55-60 range for several weeks (most typical value over the past week or two is 57).  Over the past few days, however, it jumped to around 62; a 10% increase.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPF5C.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPF5C.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The bulk of the increase occurred 2 days ago, and the only thing I can think of that happened within that timeframe is that I got a mild sunburn (from kiteboarding, so primarily on my face/forehead from looking up at the sky all afternoon).  But correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation.  So my question is, can a sunburn lead to an increase in the body's resting heartrate?  And if so, why?</p>

<p><strong>Misc Notes</strong></p>

<p>I know a Fitbit isn't a medically accurate device, and that there's pending litigation over whether they're accurate <em>at all</em>.  However my anecdotal experience with my particular device is that it's quite accurate when at rest (during strenuous exercise the instantaneous readings can indeed be a bit funky and it can temporarily lose count altogether; although the average values that get logged to the dashboard seem reasonable despite the transient outliers/glitches).  So I don't think device inaccuracy/margin of error is the explanation.</p>
","<p>One word: dehydration.</p>

<p>You spent a day out in the sun, exerting yourself, and probably didn't maintain your normal level of hydration. Consequently, you're mildly dehydrated (or, more properly, <em>hypohydrated</em>).</p>

<p>Dehydration means a lower blood volume, which in turn means your heart has to beat faster to move the same volume of blood. Consequently, your heart rate is mildly elevated until you restore your normal hydration levels. </p>

"Is early morning sunlight as good as evening sunlight for health?","6203","","<p>There are several references which say that early morning sunlight would give the best benefits (like <a href=""https://www.wellbeingescapes.com/sunbathing-is-good-for-you-html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10740553/How-early-morning-light-can-help-you-lose-weight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">that</a>). This comes from the common consensus that most of the harmful rays, at that time, are filtered out by a thicker portion of the atmosphere through which the light of the sun must pass through to reach our skin.</p>

<p>Doesn't this theory equally apply to evening sunlight as well. Are there any (notable) differences in the health benefit that one might receive from the early morning sunlight from that of the evening sunlight.</p>
","<p><em>Actually, I am a frequent flyer (I think I spend at least 10% of my year in an airplane or an airport) and I discussed the problem of sunlight with my treating physician.</em></p>

<p>First, sunlight has an impact on the circadian rythm (which involves the secretion of melatonin, cortisol, control of body temperature) which  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717723/"">regulates your wake/sleep cycle.</a> </p>

<p>The effect of evening light was examined in a study where a subject was exposed to several hours of light every evening for a week, and the timing of the rhythms of core body temperature and plasma cortisol were measured. </p>

<p>The authors reported that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both rhythms were shifted by approximately 6 hours, and examination of
  temperature data collected throughout the experiment suggested that
  the shift had already occurred after only 2 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dysregulated circadian rythms (due to impaired melatonin, cortisol and body temperature levels) is associated with many diseases among which <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018537/"">psychiatric diseases</a> and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837358/"">metabolic syndrome</a>.</strong></p>

<p>So, this possibly explains the results found in the study you linked on the telegraph.co.uk suggesting that <strong>early sunlight</strong> might reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, probably because this is associated with a physiological (ie normal) circadian rythm.</p>

<p>Finally, you linked one study regarding ""sunbathing is good for you"". I think, this should be taken with caution, particularly because <a href=""https://www.melanoma.org/understand-melanoma/preventing-melanoma/why-is-tanning-dangerous"">increased sunbathing is linked to skin cancer</a>.</p>

<p>We also discussed the effect of different timing of the day to produce the maximum of Vitamin D (I am already deficient...). He mailed me following extracts from <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717723/"">this review</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Factors that affect cutaneous production of vitamin D3 include
  latitude, season, time of day, air pollution, cloud cover, melanin
  content of the skin, use of sunblock, age and the extent of clothing
  covering the body. <strong>When the sun is low on the horizon, the
  atmospheric ozone, clouds and particulate air pollution absorb UVB
  radiation, limiting the amount that reach the surface of the Earth.
  The zenith angle of the sun plays a critical role in vitamin D3
  production. When the zenith angle is more oblique, the path length
  through the stratospheric ozone layer is increased and hence, fewer
  UVB photons are able to reach the earth’s surface</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So overall, current research evidence speaks in favor of morning sunlight. Evening sunlight might on the contrary be associated with negative effects.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"Is brushing teeth without toothpaste actually harmful?","5961","","<p>Another user mentioned that brushing teeth without toothpaste is dangerous because it's <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/6440/2713"">""likely to cause micro-scratches in the enamel of one's teeth""</a>. How true is the claim?</p>

<p>To be exact, let's assume that the mouth is ""<strong>fully rinsed</strong>"" with clean tap-water and the bristles of the toothbrush are ""<strong>fully wet</strong>"" with clean tap-water.</p>

<p>Is  brushing teeth without toothpaste actually bad for the gums (and teeth / general oral health)?</p>
","<p>My short answer is : <strong>Brushing your tooth without toothpaste will not cause a greater amount of micro-scratches than if you were to use toothpaste</strong>. </p>

<p>To begin, <strong>tooth paste</strong>, is a product most often made of <strong>abrasive substances</strong> that <strong>increases</strong> the <strong>scrubbing power</strong> of the toothbrush bristles. Some kinds of toothpaste can also accomplish other things, such as reducing dental sensitivity (potassium nitrate, Sensodyne®) or make teeth more resistant to caries and acidity (Fluoride).</p>

<p>In other words it is the <strong>physical movement</strong> of the bristles of the brush that <strong>removes plaque</strong> that accumulates on and between the teeth and gums.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is not the tooth paste that will make the greatest impact on your teeth and gums but <strong>the way you move your toothbrush</strong> on the surfaces of your teeth and gums.</p>

<p>If you brush too aggressively, you will at first cause the gums to recede and then will use prematurely the enamel on your teeth.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things to do to brush properly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Brush your teeth by using the modified Bass (roll-brush) method</strong>. Keep your toothbrush at a 45º angle and make small circular movements, on a set of 2-3 teeth at a time. Avoid broad, horizontal, back-and-fourth movements, since they will irritate the gums. Once a set of teeth has been brushed, make one sweep from the gum to the teeth, to remove any debris stuck in between.</li>
<li><strong>Don't put too much pressure</strong>, and use a soft or super-soft bristle toothbrush. If done correctly, the plaque and bio-film will be removed by the movement of the toothbrush bristles. Anything that is harder than what a soft bristle can remove is probably tarter (calcified plaque) which needs to get removed by a dentist or hygienist.</li>
<li>If you need to remove food stuck between teeth, <strong>use floss</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A more in-depth look into mechanical plaque control could be done, but it would be somewhat outside the scope of the original question.</p>

"Increase in acne during weight loss. Is it normal?","5956","","<p>I'm 100kg male. I'm losing 1kg-2kg per week with  cardio and diet. Recently I noticed an increase in acnes around my arm and back. Also my forehad is more oily than usual. </p>

<p>Are these changes normal for someone who is losing weight? </p>

<p>I am overweight because of junk food and I still eat junk food. 1/3 of my daily intake is chips, pizza etc. but it is limited to 500cal a day on average.</p>
","<p>Well unfortunately, without a lot more detail on the changes you've made to your diet and how you go about your exercise, it is impossible to exactly pin-point where the problem is, but here are some facts and pointers to help you out.</p>

<p>There are three main factors here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hormone levels</li>
<li>Diet changes</li>
<li>How you exercise</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hormone Levels</strong></p>

<p>Normally, training alone doesn't cause significant increases in testosterone for there to be an effect on skin / acne, but if you are taking any supplements for this (like testosterone boosters), or happen to be going through puberty, then you may want to look into this with a doctor / dermatologist. </p>

<p><strong>Diet Changes</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of foods that you may have implemented in your new diet that can be causing acne. Dairy, for example, has had plenty of studies going back and forth as to the effects it has on acne, with a nice amount claiming certain amounts of dairy can cause it. </p>

<p>For more information on dietary causes, please read <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/features/worst-foods-for-your-skin"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> full of information and advice. It will help you spot any new foods you may have introduced into your diet.</p>

<p><strong>How you Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Just like the dairy studies, plenty of people have gone back and forth with studies and evidence on sweating clogging up your pores. </p>

<p>The main principle behind this is that as you sweat, the sweat brings dirt and oils from the surface of your skin into your pores for them to get clogged. </p>

<p><a href=""http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/men/sweating-odor/does-sweating-cause-acne.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> gives more information on how sweat affects acne.</p>

<p>And from personal experience, sweating caused me to develop some acne when I started training, so if this is the cause of your acne, you need to look at a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>How soon after your exercise do you shower? Leaving the sweat on your face for a prolonged amount of time isn't recommended, and you should wash your face as soon as you finish. On the counter-side of this, do not wash your face too often, as dry skin can also give you skin issues / acne. </li>
<li>While exercising, make sure you are using a clean towel free of dirt to dry your face. Do not reuse towels before washing them between workouts. The dirt and oil left on a towel can be detrimental in preventing acne developing when you sweat. </li>
<li>When showering, try using an exfoliating face wash that will assist you in properly deep cleaning your pores after a workout. Any product you use should be tested first, and used sparingly. </li>
</ul>

<p>For more info on face washing, please check out <a href=""http://www.acne.org/wash-face.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> for good tips on how to, and also for further tips on products.</p>

<p><strong>So in Conclusion:</strong> </p>

<p>Your acne can be caused by a plethora of changes you can be making to your body through hormones, diet, and exercise. But pinpointing the issue from the tips above and reading the cited material will help you make the changes needed to prevent it and finding the cause. </p>

"Could any Vaccines be dangerous for G6PD enzyme deficient people?","5879","","<p>I have searched a lot, but didn't find an answer for this: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any Vaccines that could be dangerous for G6PD enzyme deficient people?</li>
</ul>

<p>About g6pd : <a href=""http://www.g6pd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.g6pd.org/</a></p>
","<p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that protects red blood cell against oxidative damage. G6PD deficiency is one the most common genetic disorders.</p>

<p>Most of the patients with G6PD deficiency remain clinically asymptomatic. However they are at increased risk of developing acute haemolytic anemia (AHA) in the presence of oxidative agents, which can be either fava beans, infections and drugs.</p>

<p>Considering that infection can precipitate acute haemolytic anemia, which can in some case have severe outcomes, vaccination would confer a solid way to prevent this. </p>

<p>The question asks about any contraindications for vaccinations in G6PD deficient patients.</p>

<p>Consulting the Vaccine Contraindications and Precautions provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/contraindications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/contraindications.html</a>) did not mention G6PD deficiency as proven contraindications for vaccination. Additionally, a search in Medline (a biomedical literature referencing more than 26 millions citations from journals and online books) does not seem to provide any studies or case report concerning the occurrence of adverse events in G6PD deficient patient after immunisation either.</p>

<p>One study advocated hepatitis A vaccination in patient with G6PD deficiency in order to prevent damaging consequences from intravascular hemolysis precipitated by acute hepatitis A infection in two children with G6PD deficiency.</p>

<p>So far, there seems to be a lack of evidence against vaccination in G6PD patients. Like in many cases in medicine, the benefits of vaccination should be balanced with its possible adverse events. </p>

"Why do drugs expire?","5567","","<p>I've googled through internet, and all I found was ""what expiration dates mean"". I found nothing about the underlying mechanism of expiration. </p>

<p>As drugs are chemicals, why do they expire? Are there chemical reactions that produce other chemicals?</p>
","<p>Drug molecules, even when stored safely inside a tablet\capsule, inside a closed container, upon a high shelf (hopefully), are still exposed to the environment, and are thus exposed to all of the chemical processes and reactions that go about all around us (to name just a few - oxidation, hydrolysis, isomerization, polymerization, and more). Depending on the type of drug molecule and its functional groups, the molecule may undergo all kinds of chemical processes that may change its structure and\or properties.</p>

<p>Therefore, drugs (and foodstuffs, as mentioned in the comment above) degrade and decompose over time, and are thus given an expiration date to indicate that after a certain amount of time, the drug's manufacturer strongly recommends to avoid using the product.</p>

<p>An important remark should follow: the expiration date refers to <strong>the entire pharmaceutical product</strong>, i.e. the formulation, and not just the active ingredient. It is absolutely possible that the active ingredient will remain stable for a long time, but some inactive ingredient (excipient) in the  tablet\capsule\syrup will have undergone some decomposition that may render the product ineffective, or even worse, toxic.</p>

<p>A quick Google search for ""drug decomposition"" or ""drug degradation"" yields many useful results for further reading. To name just a few:</p>

","<p>In most cases, swimming is good exercise. Light swimming is also a therapy for people with joint and back pain. The breaststroke is not usually the recommended stroke for therapy because, if done incorrectly, it can be harmful. </p>

<p>Because you have to keep bringing your head up to breath, the joints in your upper back and neck get extended, and have to deal with a lot of stress from repetitive movement. This can cause a lot pain, especially to those who have experienced back problems before. Having your head up and looking forward can also cause your hips to drop, which puts extra strain on the lower back. This can lead to extra back problems, such as <a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hyperextension"" rel=""nofollow"">hyperextension</a>.</p>

And yes, tampons can cause lower abdominal pain in the presence of endometriosis (ectopic endometrial tissue). The symptoms of endometriosis can include pain on micturition, defecation, tampon or diaphragm insertion, increased pain with menses, intercourse, etc.</p>

<p>Use of tampons in healthy females is generally well-tolerated.</p>

<p>Edited to address OP's edit:</p>

<p>Tampons are generally well tolerated by healthy, normal females. However, there are groups of females that do find tampon use uncomfortable, chief among them adolescents. For this reason, physicians often speak with adolescents at menarche about tampon use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With regard to comfort, girls often choose tampons of too high absorbency. Highly absorbent tampons may cause discomfort in young girls because of their larger size or because of a drying effect during wear and upon withdrawal. Advise your patient to choose the lowest tampon absorbency for her needs by experimenting with a pad or pantiliner for backup protection. Less absorbent products can be used on lighter days. This guidance is also consistent with the Food and Drug Administration’s current recommendations for reducing the risk of menstrual toxic shock syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, young girls should use smaller tampons. Pain with tampon use in this age group is more likely and in some cases can lead to problems with pain later on.</p>

"Why do doctors prescribe steroid tablets even though they know the side effects?","5063","","<p>Sometimes doctors prescribe steroid tablets to suppress pain for diseases, such as <a href=""http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/drugs/steroid-tablets.aspx"">arthritis</a>. Why do they prescribe it even though they know the side effects? </p>
","<p>I think a missing bit of information that might help you get a better sense of this practice is: <strong>steroids are miracle drugs.</strong> </p>

<p>OK, that was in jest - no miracles here. Truth be told, though, if there is a single class of drugs that has added more <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"">quality-adjusted life-years</a> to human history than any other, steroids must be competing with just a few antibiotic classes for that title.</p>

<p>To make clear what we’re talking about, the term “steroid” as a label for drugs generally refers to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"">glucocorticoids</a> (GCs) - drugs that act like cortisol, an endogenous steroid hormone. Commonly used GCs include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Short acting</strong>: hydrocortisone, cortisone</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate-acting</strong>: prednisone, prednisolone, mehthylprednisolone, triamcinolone</li>
<li><strong>Long-acting</strong>: betamethasone, dexamethasone, paramethasone</li>
</ul>

<p>Your question poses a specific example of one indication for steroids but seems to be asking about the use of these drugs more generally. As others have brought up, any decision about drug treatment involves weighing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk%E2%80%93benefit_ratio""><strong>risk-benefit ratio</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>Although going through the efficacy data for various conditions is beyond the scope of this answer, I list a sampling of the common indications for GC treatment, and in the concluding paragraph I will provide specific efficacy data for arthritis.   </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Replacement therapy</strong>: due to either primary adrenal insufficiency (<a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/addisons-disease/basics/definition/con-20021340"">Addison’s disease</a>) or secondary/tertiary insufficiency (at the level of the hypothalamus or pituitary.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inflammatory conditions</strong> (deep breath in): asthma, eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, eosinophilic anything, inflammatory arthritis, anaphylaxis, septic shock (in very specific circumstances), polymyalgia rheumatica, polyarteritis nodosa, temporal arteritis, minimal change glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, urticaria, autoimmune hepatitis</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other things that aren’t (necessarily) obviously inflammatory</strong>: increased intracranial pressure, intractable nausea, acute leukemia, sarcoidosis, cluster headaches, dermatomyositis</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>First, please note that a few of the indications for GC require only a very brief burst of high-dose GC. In this time course, these drugs actually very few serious side effects (psychiatric effects and hyperglycemia are exceptions, but rarely outweigh the benefit). Over the longer term, however, supra-physiologic doses of GC have an array of adverse effects that fall into a few categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis</strong>: Exogenous GCs suppress the hypothalamic pathway that stimulates the adrenal gland, resulting in adrenal atrophy. This means that if the exogenous GC is abruptly discontinued, <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000357.htm"">adrenal crisis</a> can ensue. The rule of thumb I learned was that >3 weeks treatment with  >10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) can cause HPA suppression. As a result, GC treatment that meets these criteria is generally ended with a taper, allowing the adrenal to regenerate, whereupon it can resume normal function.<br><br>
This side effect is usually a non-issue if the medication is tapered correctly. Therefore, the benefits of treatment will generally outweigh the risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cushing’s syndrome</strong>: This term is generally applied to the  constellation of symptoms occuring with chronic administration of supra-physiologic doses of GC. <br> </p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperglycemia   </li>
<li>Hypertension  </li>
<li>Psychiatric effects: insomnia, precipitation of mania or psychosis in susceptible individuals</li>
<li>Salt retention<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Decreased bone mineral density</li>
<li>Weight gain: generally in a pattern characterized by central adiposity and peripheral muscle atrophy</li>
<li>Increased intra-ocular pressure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, after all that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do doctors prescribe steroid tablets though they knew the side effect?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the benefit outweighs the risk.<sup>2</sup> For the example you gave &mdash; arthritis<sup>3</sup> &mdash; the best paper I found was a <a href=""http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/7/807.long"">meta-analysis</a> that used a statistical method that compares the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_treat"">number needed to treat</a> (NNT) with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_harm"">number needed to harm</a> (NNH) for long-term (>1 year) treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The ratio there NNH/NNT was 0.25, which is considered “good.” I’ll let you read their methods if you’d like the details. For further reading on this methodology and insights into how we quantitatively assess the comparison between risks and benefits, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20412543"">this article by Guo et al.</a> provides some good bedtime reading.</p>

<p><sub>
<strong>Notes</strong>:
</sub><br>
<sub>
1. This is actually a mineralocoricoid rather than a GC effect, only present for those GCs whose receptor specificity overlaps, most prominently the short-acting agents hydrocortisone and cortisone.
</sub>  </p>

<p><sub>
2. Usually. Steroids are probably over-used in some settings because most people know that steroids tend to “make everybody feel better.” They can be an easy way to make patients happy if the side effects aren’t fully appreciated. Thus (in case you needed me to tell you!), your question is a valid one.
</sub><br><br>
<sub>
3. I’m assuming here rheumatoid arthritis, because this is the most common type of arthritis for which steroids are appropriate. For the more common osteo-“arthritis” &mdash; a.k.a. degenerative joint disease &mdash; I’m sure steroids would make patients feel better, but the benefit there <em>rarely</em> outweighs the risk.</p>

"Is it normal for a bruise under a fingernail to move towards the end of the finger as the nail grows?","5033","","<p>So in the middle of last month I accidentally jammed a running drill into my thumbnail. It hurt like a mother. It's left a bruise, which initially was touching the base of the nail. I noticed today that the bruise it has left has actually cleared the lighter portion of the nail near the base, and is much close to the middle, but it hasn't changed in appearance much. It appears to be advancing towards the end of my finger as the nail grows. It doesn't hurt even when pressed, so I'm not too concerned about, but thought that it was curious.</p>

<p>Is it normal for a bruise to grow out with the nail?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/bleeding-under-nail"" rel=""nofollow"">Yes, this is normal behavior</a> for a bruise underneath the nail.

<p>Most bruises under a nail are caused by a crush type injury. In severe cases, there may be enough blood to separate the nail from the nail bed, or it may need professional drainage and treatment (Such as suturing and/or removing the nail).</p>

<p>If it is a small spot, then as the nail grows, the hematoma will move with it as the blood is trapped between the bed and the nail. If you have a bruise appearing spot underneath the nail that is unrelated to any injury, or does not move outwards with the growth of the nail it is best to get it checked out, as those are warning signs of it being a tumor.</p>

"Does drinking water more than 10 liters per day has any benefit or side effect?","5018","","<p>I knew the fact that drinking water more is good for health. 3 Liters per day is good enough for health. But I am drinking more than 10 liters per day. My question is does drinking water more than 10 liters reduce body heat or do I have any side effect for it ?</p>
","<p>Drinking the appropriate amount of water is okay, but when it becomes excessive, then it could lead to some dangerous circumstances.</p>

<p>The appropriate amount of water varies according to lifestyle. According to the popular 8 by 8 rule which says that one should drink eight glasses, each consisting of eight ounce of water, may not suit every individual. Says nutritionist Venu Adhiya Hirani, ""While the general belief is to drink eight to 10 glasses of water, it is advisable to drink 12 to 15 glasses of fluids which includes water, tea, buttermilk, soup, etc. This would amount to an intake of around 2.5 litres of fluids everyday.""</p>

<p>According to Krishnan, If you have a sedentary lifestyle and work in an air-conditioned environment where there is no scope for water loss via sweat, drinking more than 2 to 2.5 litres of water is not advisable. It will end up accumulating in your kidney and cause edema. For moderate workers like salespersons, who are required to do physical activity, it is important to drink around three litres of water.</p>

<p>“It also depends on your size and weight, and also on your activity level and where you live,” Nessler says. “In general, you should try to drink between half an ounce and an ounce of water for each pound you weigh, every day."" For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, that would be 75 to 150 ounces of water a day.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences of drinking excess water</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Causes Hyponatremia:</strong></p>

<p>The sodium content in the blood influences the functioning of the electrolytes. These electrolytes are responsible for sending signals to the cells which control various operations of the body. When you consume too much water, the sodium levels in the blood decrease. This stops the electrolytes from sending signals to the cells.</p>

<p><strong>2. Overburdens The Heart:</strong></p>

<p>The heart performs the vital function of pumping blood through your entire body. When you consume too much of water, this increases the volume of blood inside your body. The increased blood volume causes unnecessary pressure on the blood vessels and the heart, leading to seizure in some cases.</p>

<p><strong>3. Causes Damage To Glomeruli:</strong></p>

<p>Glomeruli are capillary beds in our kidneys. They work as a filtering station to excrete excess water from the body. Too much of water can cause potential damage to this system, leading to serious health hazards. The kidneys have to work overtime to process all this unnecessary water that is beyond their normal filtering capacity (1000 ml per hour).</p>

<p><strong>4. Causes Swelling Of Cells:</strong></p>

<p>As your blood gets diluted due to excess water, the concentration of electrolytes in the blood becomes lower than that in the cells. To maintain a balance in the concentration of electrolytes in the blood and the cells, water begins to flow into the cells. This results in swelling of cells, which is a dangerous condition.</p>

<p><strong>5. Causes Brain Edema:</strong></p>

<p>This is the swelling of brain cells. It is as hazardous as it sounds. Most of the cells in our body have a lot of room to stretch out. But the flat bones in our skull do not leave much space for the brain cells to be accommodated freely. When excess water in the blood vessels starts seeping into the brain cells, it causes swelling in the cells of the brain. This leads to severe conditions that include coma, brainstem herniation, and respiratory attack.</p>

"What is excess blood from blood donations used for, and do we ever run out?","4876","","<p>I regularly donate blood, however, I am curious as to what happens to my blood after I donate.  Obviously some of it will go to people in emergency medical situations, as I intend.  However, I have never heard of situations where someone died because we didn't have blood to donate to them; which makes it sound as if we don't have a blood deficit.  That in turn makes me wonder what the excess blood is used for.</p>

<p>So I have two related questions.  First, do we ever <em>have</em> a blood deficit, situations where someone who could have been saved in a hospital dies because there wasn't blood to treat them?  Or specifically situations like that caused by a lack of donors, not some logistical issue getting it where it needs to be.  I have had the red cross call me and tell me that they have a 'deficit' many times, but frankly I hear it so often it leaves me questioning their definition of deficit.  How often do we really run out?</p>

<p>Related, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?  I assume that some blood is regularly thrown out, but they figure it's better to have extra and risk it expiring then to run out during an emergency.  However, if we have a high enough surplus do they do something else with it?  For instance is it used for medical research?  If we had say 5% fewer donors would it be our medical research which suffered, but not patients in the hospital?</p>

<p>I will continue donating blood regardless of the answer here.  I'm simply curious as to the result.  Well that and it informs this discussion: <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28118/is-the-red-cross-policy-of-refusing-donation-from-homosexual-men-justified-by-in"">https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28118/is-the-red-cross-policy-of-refusing-donation-from-homosexual-men-justified-by-in</a></p>
","<p>Great question! I think it's answerable as an overview, but please know this is only the tip of the iceberg.*</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Yes, we have deficits of certain blood products in certain locations at certain times that affect patient care. However, a small percentage of blood product does expire unused (because it wasn't the <em>right</em> product [see background] in the <em>right</em> place at the <em>right</em> time).</p>

<p><strong>A little background</strong>  </p>

<p>Donated blood is not usually transfused into a patient as whole blood. Instead, it's broken down into several components which are transfused in different clinical scenarios. The issues of storage and supply are different for each component. The components are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plasma, and derivatives</li>
<li>Red Blood Cells (RBCs)</li>
<li>Platelets</li>
<li>Granulocytes (rarely transfused)</li>
</ul>

<p>These different components require different storage conditions, so they are separated as soon as possible after donation.</p>

<p><strong>OP's first question</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, do we ever have a blood deficit, situations where someone who could have been saved in a hospital dies because there wasn't blood to treat them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Well, actually your question is impossible to answer. :-) We could never know whether someone could-have-been-saved with a transfusion nor whether someone who received a transfusion would-have-died. Those are hypothetical constructs that are interesting to think about but are not compatible with research. </p>

<p>However, we <em>can</em> ask whether there is evidence that blood supply on a clinical level is limited, for instance: </p>

<ul>
<li>doctors are requesting products that aren't available for patients;  </li>
<li>doctors are requesting fewer products than they think would be ideal for a particular patient because of a blood bank shortage;    </li>
<li>elective surgeries are being postponed; or </li>
<li>blood banks are substituting products that may have a slightly increased risk of complications due to less-than-ideal immune compatibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are more nuanced than they seem, but to some degree all do occur. </p>

<p>Quoting from a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17465938"">paper in the journal Transfusion entitled <em>How do I manage a blood shortage in a transfusion service?</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although there are more than 16 million blood donations per year provided to more than 4 million recipients, blood shortages have recurred for decades [...] twice every year. Anyone with any experience at blood centers or transfusion services is quite accustomed to these expected shortages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He further notes that this problem is likely to worsen because the requirement for transfusions (all types) is increasing at a rate of 5-7% per year while donations are not matching that increase.</p>

<p>The first thing that happens when there is a blood bank shortage usually involves the Transfusion Medicine specialist in the blood bank having a conversation with every doctor who orders the blood product that is limited. Together they determine whether a smaller amount of product or a deferment in transfusion might be clinically appropriate/acceptable. </p>

<p>The distinction between those last two words &mdash; <code>appropriate|accetable</code> &mdash; is the key to whether clinical care is actually being compromised. In many cases, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26019707"">clinicians indeed are requesting product beyond what is recommended in published guidelines</a>, because they feel that the patient's condition warrants it due to some special circumstance. It seems likely that at least a small percentage of the time, the clinician was right, but this can never be proven.</p>

<p>It is also the case that <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ash/bloodsafety/2011-nbcus.pdf"">elective surgeries are sometimes postponed for this reason</a> (see chart 8-1, p 43), although it's rare. </p>

<p><strong>Another question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Related, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?... is it used for medical research?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although localized shortages of particular products do occur and are disruptive, it is true that a small percentage of the products expire unused. In the U.S., this was estimated at 14% of supply in 1989 and had fallen to 5.2% in 2011, per <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ash/bloodsafety/2011-nbcus.pdf"">a report from the US Dept Health and Human Services</a>, the most recent data available I've found. These are complicated and nuanced data that this format does not allow complete explanation of (and I myself am not completely familiar with), but please read <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ash/bloodsafety/2011-nbcus.pdf"">the linked HHS report</a> if interested.</p>

<p>As for what happens to the excess - it's probably discarded, although I can't prove that. Regarding your question about research: In addition to being sub-optimal because it's old, the blood was originally collected from human donors. Such research would be subjected to IRB requirements for protection of human subjects. This would likely require researchers to obtain permission from donors (/subjects) at the time of donation to use the product for research. This may happen in localized settings, but I know of no large-scale project.</p>

"How can I protect my eyesight when using computers?","4537","","<p>My job requires long periods of computer screen use. I have good eyesight (20/15) and don't wear glasses, but I definitely notice my eyes feeling fatigued at the end of the day. Sometimes when I'm short on sleep, I have trouble focusing or see slightly blurred vision.</p>

<p>I want to protect my eyesight as much as possible. What are the best practices for doing so if you spend a lot of time staring at screens?</p>
","<h3>20-20-20 Rule</h3>

<p>Every 20 minutes of looking at the screen, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Also, try to blink a lot.</p>

<h3>Adjusting settings</h3>

<p>Using a larger font to read helps to reduce eye strain. Adjusting your brightness helps, usually brighter screens are better in brighter rooms, dimmer screens are better in dark rooms.</p>

<p>Also, try to make your computer screen lower than your eyes; more of your eye is covered by your eyelid when you look down, so there will be more lubrication and you will subconsciously blink more.</p>

<h3>Eating</h3>

<p>Eat foods with vitamin A, which helps with the health of your eyes. See <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/79/do-carrots-actually-improve-eyesight"">this question</a> for more.</p>

"What should I consider when deciding to remove a blister or not?","4301","","<p>While playing indoor soccer a couple days ago, I was fouled and fell forwards so that my hand skidded across the court a bit. It left the blister as you see in the image here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PDHo5m.jpg"" alt=""the blister""></p>

<p>What should I consider when deciding to remove this blister? I could open and drain this blister, removing the excess skin afterwards, or leave it as is.</p>

<p>I figure since it's in a place that is likely to be touched/disrupted I should remove it since it's likely to open anyways.</p>
","<p>In the blister shown, the likelihood of rupture is decreased because of the thickness of the epidermis on the palm of the hand, so you can leave it alone until the underlying area re-epithelializes. You'll know this is happening because of the decreased pain and the slow reabsorption of the fluid. Eventually you will just peal it off what's left of the blister, finding clean new skin underneath.</p>

<p>But this is a great starting point for an answer about the treatment of blisters in general: is it better to leave them alone, drain the fluid, or de-roof them (take the top of the blister off)?</p>

<p>There is <em>a lot</em> of disagreement about what constitutes the optimal treatment of blisters. Some background might be in order.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lJIv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Blisters form when the upper layers of the epidermis separate from the lower layers, usually at the level of the stratum spinosum. At that level, the cells (because of proximity to the dermis, which contains the capillaries) have moisture in and between them. When the separation occurs, <em>sterile</em> fluid from the stratum spinosum oozes unopposed into the space between the layers, and a blister forms.</p>

<p>The fluid, similar to plasma, contains molecules which may promote the rapid division which takes place in the stratum basale.  This then differentiates into the upper layers of the epidermis and healing by new skin formation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hydrostatic pressure causes the area of the separation to fill with a fluid that is similar in composition to plasma but has a lower protein level. About 6 hours after formation of the blister, cells in the blister base begin to take amino acids and nucleosides; at 24 hours, there is high mitotic activity in the basal cells; at 48 and 120 hours, new stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, respectively, can be seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>sterile</em> fluid is a very rich and inviting growth medium for bacteria. For this reason, some people think it should be removed. The denuded skin underneath has lost some of it's protection against infection. For this reason, some think the blister should be left intact. Between these two extremes are those who favor drainage of the fluid leaving the cover intact.</p>

<p>To my thinking (and training), this is the worst option. Poking a hole in the blister, no matter how cleanly it's done, will leave a point of entry for bacteria (it doesn't take much). The bacteria will flourish in the moisture (which will still seep into the space) under the roof of the blister, protected from being washed away. This may (and often does) lead to an infection of the wound.</p>

<p>It's much better to prevent infection than to treat it. </p>

<p>The reasoning of either of the other camps is more supportable. I favor leaving the blister intact as long as possible, giving the underlying wound time to form new stratified protective epidermalis.</p>

<p>Treatment by people in this camp consists of carefully cleaning and disinfecting the surface of the blister and the surrounding skin, and covering it loosely with protective padding, usually gauze, then wrapping the entire thing with gauze wrap. The patient is instructed to check the blister daily; if it ""pops"" or becomes cloudy, the roof must be removed (most people prefer to have this done by a doctor or nurse), the area cleaned to remove any bacteria which might have entered, and a sterile dressing (over a light application of an antibacterial cream) reapplied, and changes daily until healed.</p>

<p>The opposite camp reasons that the blister will break anyway, so get it over with and get the sterile dressing on, then clean and redress (with a light application of an antibacterial cream) daily. Also, if the blister is tense, it may be impeding healing of the base by decreasing blood flow. The problem with this approach is that it hurts more than leaving it alone, and the risk of infection is still greater than if the blister is intact.</p>

<p>Many studies have been done to try to determine the best approach. Common sense plays a role. If the blister is very delicate (as in a large, tense and fragile blister of a burn), or if it looks unstable, I'll remove the roof of the blister. If I think it can be preserved for even one or two days, I'll leave it on. Every day it's left on without infection is a day of healing and decreased pain as new skin is made.</p>

<p>From one paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There seems to be a paucity of good clinical evidence related to this subject, despite several review articles. The sole paper found involved a small sample, but showed infection rates to be higher if blisters are aspirated or deroofed, and that pain scores were higher in the group that underwent deroofing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a pain point of view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>aspiration appears to result in less pain than deroofing. (See above: also more infection.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The common sense comes in with type, size, and location of blister, reliability of care by the patient or their family, location or level of activity likely to cause rupture, or in the case of hikers' blisters (and others away from medical care), what the best model is to prevent infection while still using the involved area if necessary.</p>

<p>Also changing the scene are the new available protective dressings of deroofed blisters that allow moist healing, non-occlusive protection and visibility of the underlying skin. </p>

"What is a T2 hyperintense focus in the subcortical white matter?","4291","","<p>What is a T2 hyperintense focus? What does it mean, in English, for there to be a T2 hyperintense focus in the subcortical white matter of the right middle frontal gyrus?</p>
","<p>There are a few terms to define here, and I'll go through them one by one:</p>

<p><strong>T2</strong></p>

<p>This has to do with the type of scan. MRI's are pretty complicated technologically, but the basic idea is that body tissues are full of water, and water molecules respond to magnets. If you turn on a really powerful magnet near body tissues, the water molecules in the tissues will align with the magnetic field. Turn off the magnet and pulse a radio signal, and you'll shake the molecules back into a random alignment and they'll shoot back a radio signal as they move. This is called <em>magnetic resonance</em>.</p>

<p>If you can detect all the little radio signals coming back from all the molecules and figure out where they all came from, you can map out where all the water molecules are, which tells you where the tissues are. Do it precisely enough, and you can make a high-quality image of whatever tissue you're scanning. This is <em>magnetic resonance imaging</em>, or MRI.</p>

<p>The problem is, like with a camera, you only get an image of one side. If you want everything in 3D, you need to repeat this again and again from a bunch of different angles. That's what you're hearing when the MRI machine goes bang, bang, bang, bang, bang... — the machine is getting the image again and again from every possible angle. It's also repeating images on each location for more information.</p>

<p>There are a few variables you can tinker with to tune the image to what you're looking for, most notably repetition time (TR), how long you wait between each pulse, and time to echo (TE), how long between the radio pulse being sent and the echo being captured. If you set the machine to wait a very short time between pulses (short TR), and a very short time between sending each radio pulse and capturing its result (short TE), you're going to get what's called a T1-weighted image. Much longer TR and TE produce a different image, called a T2-weighted image. Even longer, and you get a FLAIR image.</p>

<p>These are just names for the different types of scans you can get by playing with TR and TE, but the rationale for what makes an image T1- or T2- weighted is based on properties of the water molecules themselves, literally quantum physics. You're welcome to look them up though if you like, and get a really good understanding of exactly what makes the image look that way.</p>

<p><strong>Hyperintense Focus</strong></p>

<p>Intensity on an MRI refers to the brightness of a given spot. But because doctors are doctors, instead of calling it a spot, they refer to a given location on the MRI as a ""focus."" This term tends to be reserved for when something special is going on there.</p>

<p>To go a bit deeper into intensity, a <em>hyperintensity</em> is a spot that's brighter than you'd expect it to be, and a <em>hypointensity</em> is a spot that's darker than you'd expect it to be. In a T2-weighted MRI specifically, watery tissues shine brightest, meaning that a hyperintensity — or hyperintense focus — in a T2 MRI is a particularly watery area, often something unusual. But exactly what it means depends on where the hyperintensity is.</p>

<p><strong>White Matter</strong></p>

<p>Your brain is divided into two basic types of material, white matter and gray matter.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the gray matter forms the outermost surface of the brain, the cerebral cortex, which is in charge of most of the actual thinking that takes place in your brain, like getting input from your senses, sending output to your muscles, and connecting the two with, well, your consciousness and most human mental abilities.</p>

<p>White matter on the other hand is like all of the wires that connect the gray matter together, and sits below the surface of the brain.</p>

<p>Structurally, you can think of the white matter as the ""body"" of the brain and the gray matter as the ""skin,"" even though the gray matter does just about all of the actual thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Subcortical</strong></p>

<p>There are really three important sections of the brain when it comes to hyperintensities: the periventricular white matter, the deep white matter, and the subcortical white matter. The subcortical white matter is just a little bit deeper than the gray matter of the cerebral cortex. The deep white matter is even deeper than that, going towards the center of the brain, the ventricles. The periventricular (""near the ventricles"") white matter is right along the ventricles at the innermost parts of the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Right Middle Frontal Gyrus</strong></p>

<p>The cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, is divided into four lobes from back to front and bottom to top: the occipital lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe. If you only look at the gyri, or outer folds of the brain, you end up with the colored areas below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFedC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFedC.png"" alt=""Gyri of the Cerebrum""></a></p>

<p>The frontal lobe is then divided into a number of sections, the main three of which are the superior, middle and inferior gyri, labeled above as <em>gyrus frontalis superior</em>, <em>gyrus frontalis medius</em> and <em>gyrus frontalis inferior</em>. The middle section, the middle frontal gyrus, is what we're looking for. Because the brain is split into left and right halves, we end up with two middle frontal gyri, the left one and the right one, shown below.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qA5m.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qA5m.png"" alt=""Red Middle Frontal Gyri""></a>
This is the brain of a guy facing you from the front, looking slightly to your right. The part of his brain you're seeing would be just under the forehead. The red sections are the left and right middle frontal gyri. Remember that these parts are labeled from the perspective of the guy whose brain it is, and not from the perspective of the observer. So the red spot to the left is his right middle frontal gyrus.</p>

<h3>All Together</h3>

<p>Finally, what is a T2 hyperintense focus in the subcortical white matter of the right middle frontal gyrus?</p>

<p>The T2 tells you that the image was made using a T2-weighted MRI scan. The hyperintense focus is a bright spot, likely caused by higher than expected water content. Remember that bright doesn't mean ""compared to the rest of the scan,"" it means ""compared to how that area is supposed to look."" The subcortical white matter is just the white matter directly below the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain. The right middle frontal gyrus is the left red section in the image above.</p>

<p>So all in all, it's a brighter than expected spot in the layer of white matter just below the outer surface of the brain, in the red section to the left above.</p>

"How to reduce apnea/hypoapnea events?","4217","","<p>When using a machine (such as CPAP, APAP, BiPAP) to help control sleep apnea, is there anything that can be done to help lower your AHI (apnea-hypoapnea index; the number of sleep apnea events per hour) if it is still higher then you want it to be?</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>For those that may be concerned a doctor is involved, just asking in case anyone has experience with it during treatment.</p>
","<p>The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is a measure of severity in <a href=""http://www.aasmnet.org/resources/factsheets/sleepapnea.pdf"">obstructive sleep apnea</a>. It is calculated as the number of times per hour that the airway partially or completely collapses, associated with a drop in oxygen levels.  Partial collapse is labeled a hypopnea, whereas complete collapse is labeled an apnea. CPAP treatment uses air pressure delivered through a mask to stent open the airway. <em>If there continues to be partial or complete collapse despite CPAP, the basic idea, in theory, is that the pressure is inadequate.</em></p>

<p><strong>The major caveat</strong>: 
Where are you getting this AHI? Most likely, you’re reading it off a PAP machine. The upshot of this answer is that, as much as we all love numbers, such readings should not be trusted.</p>

<p>The AHI was initially validated in the setting of overnight polysomnography, i.e. a sleep lab. There a technician watches the tracings generated from a nasal pressure transducer, chest/abdomen effort belts, and continuous pulse oximetry. There are specific criteria for scoring apneas and hypopneas. The recommended <a href=""http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=4203"">criteria from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> for a hypopnea are now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure...</p>
  
  <p>b. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds.</p>
  
  <p>c. There is a ≥3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline and/or the event is associated with an arousal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has been <strong>a lot</strong> of controversy in recent years as to whether that number in the c criterion should be 3% or 4% drop in pulse oximetry. <strong>Why should we care?</strong>    </p>

<p>The number you’re getting off your PAP machine has no pulse oximetry to correlate with. They must therefore be using some <em>other</em> non-standard metric. How do they calculate this? This, unfortunately, is proprietary information known only to the PAP manufacturers. Occasionally there are validation studies of varying quality published, but there is no uniformity in the industry as to what algorithm is used, and there is very little transparency about where these numbers are coming from. </p>

<p><strong>What, then?</strong><br>
Monitoring of sleep apnea treatment is symptom-based. If symptoms improve, good enough, keep with it. If there is inadequate improvement or recurrence of symptoms after improvement, things should be re-evaluated. Generally this involves one or more of the following:   </p>

<ul>
<li><p>assessing the interface (Is the mask leaking? That will cause inadequate pressure delivered to the airway.)</p></li>
<li><p>home overnight pulse oximetry  </p></li>
<li><p>adjustment of the settings on an auto-titrating machine to allow for higher pressures  </p></li>
<li><p>empirically increasing the pressure on a fixed-pressure CPAP  </p></li>
<li><p>a repeat sleep study while using PAP, adjusting the pressure settings (i.e. a titration study)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Most likely, in the next few years these technologies will get better, and hopefully transparency and uniformity will improve. In the meantime, take the AHI number on your CPAP machine with a grain of salt.</p>

"Is there a difference between anti-anxiety and anti-depression drugs?","4163","","<p>I've recently come across two terms ""Anxiolytic drugs"" and ""Anti-depressant drugs"". I wanted to know how they differ from each other; <em>if</em> they do.</p>

<p>I mean, sure, ""anxiety"" isn't the same as ""depression"" but do the <em>effects</em> of these drugs differ widely (so much, that they're classified under different names)?</p>

<p>For example, Chlorodiazepoxide is classified as an anxiolytic drug, while Phenelzine is classified as an anti-depressant. Say I had a patient <strong>A</strong> who's been prescribed Chlorodiazepoxide; patient <strong>B</strong> has been prescribed Phenelzine by a different physician. Barring possible allergic reactions, or some kind of known sensitivity to either drug, could they possibly take <em>each other's</em> medication and hope for more or less, the same effect? As in; <strong>A</strong> takes Phenelzine, but <strong>B</strong> takes Chlorodiazepoxide. [I just cooked up that example, only to see the difference between the two classes of drugs]</p>

<p>I'm still in High School, so if my question seems a little naive, apologies. </p>
","<p>Depression and anxiety are disorders that millions of people suffer from on a daily basis.
Their differences are listed below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Antidepressants are medications meant to treat depression while anti-anxiety medications are medications meant for treating anxiety disorders. Anxiety is often defined by a high amount of neural activity, and most anti-anxiety medications are sedatives and depressants (i.e. drugs that limit neural activity, rather than drugs that promote depression).  </p></li>
<li><p>Examples of antidepressants are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</p></li>
<li><p>Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibits (SNRIs)</p></li>
<li><p>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</p></li>
<li><p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</p></li>
<li><p>Herbal treatments such as St. John’s Wort</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>While examples of anti-anxiety medications are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Barbiturates (rarely prescribed anymore)</p></li>
<li><p>Benzodiazepines</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*Beta blockers</p>

<ul>
<li>SSRIs</li>
</ul>

<p>Tranquilizers most commonly prescribed as anti-anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines, are primarily prescribed for anti-anxiety, and antidepressants such as SSRIs are primarily prescribed for depression. With that said, there is crossover between the two.</p>

<p>Additionally, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications function differently. Antianxiety medications that are classified as tranquilizers are designed mainly to reduce neural activity, and to calm someone down when they are anxious, whereas antidepressants mainly affect neurotransmitters in the brain. With that said, many medications are prescribed that treat both depression and anxiety.</p>

As she prescribed my antibiotics, my doctor told me not to eat milk products for a few days, then only eat yogurt until I was off the antibiotics altogether.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm thinking about ignoring this advice and just reducing the milk products I eat. On a typical day, I drink multiple glasses of milk, eat of bowl of oatmeal with milk, eat meals with lots of cheese, and eat ice cream at night. Cutting all of this out for a few days leaves me without much to eat!</p>

<p>What are the downsides to eating milk products while on antibiotics? Is it just that, since my gut bacteria will be weakened, I risk digestional problems? Or can the consequences be more severe?</p>
","<p>Products high in calcium and magnesium should not be taken at the same time as antibiotics of the tetracycline (tetracycline, doxicycline, etc.) class, and milk should also be avoided with the quinolone class. They have the ability to bind the antibiotic in the gut, decreasing absorption. <strong>There is no reason to avoid dairy products while taking other antibiotics</strong> (such as the penicillin class, the one you're taking. The clavulanic acid is to increase it's strength against certain bacteria.) If the antibiotic package insert (or the pharmacists's instruction sheet) states it should be taken on an empty stomach, take it with water. But what you eat when you eat is your choice.</p>

<p>Some doctors believe that milk products cause increased production or thickening of secretions, and that's a problem if you have a middle ear infection. If there is fluid in the middle ear, especially infected fluid, you want the fluid to drain out of the middle ear via the eustacian tube into the back of your throat. So, the thinking that milk makes mucus worse means recommending a decrease in milk products.</p>

<p>Is that thinking correct? Probably not. Milk does not affect mucous production or quality.</p>

<p>In one study of 60 volunteers,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We conclude that no statistically significant overall association can be detected between milk and dairy product intake and symptoms of mucus production in healthy adults, either asymptomatic or symptomatic, with rhinovirus infection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has been confirmed in other studies as well. In a subset of asthmatic patients, cessation of milk consumption improved symptomatology, but this is thought to be due to an allergy to a component of milk.</p>

<hr>

<p>The advice to eat yogurt is in all likelihood an attempt to reduce the risk of C. diff (aka Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea), which is present with any antibiotic. Antibiotics upset gut flora. Live culture yogurt has some beneficial gut bacteria species. However, this, too, depends on the yogurt. Probiotics <em>are</em> helpful, but many yogurts are monocultures and/or don't contain enough bacteria to make a difference to the gut. Some do, however. So, the advice to eat yogurt is good; it may not help, but it might. Look for yogurt with live cultures (plural).</p>

<p>One meta analysis looked at research done on this very topic (which is hot in medicine right now.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea can be attributed in part to imbalances in intestinal microflora. Therefore, probiotic preparations are used to prevent this diarrhoea. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It concluded,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results suggest a strong benefit of probiotic administration on antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, but further data are needed. The evidence for beneficial effects is still not definitive. Published studies are flawed by the lack of a placebo design and by peculiar population features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, whenever I put patients on antibiotics, I also <em>prescribed</em> two yogurt brands, one serving of one in the morning and another serving of the second in the evening. The brands I recommended were shown to have sufficient CFUs (colony forming units) of several important beneficial gut inhabitants. (There weren't any single yogurt brand that had the big five.)</p>

"Is using vegetable oil bad for a ketogenic diet?","4101","","<p>I have read on various sources that vegetble oil is improper for a ketogenic diet. But I do not understand why. </p>

<p>If the fats are suppose to turn into ketones, which in turn are burned for energy instead of sugar, and since any oil is a fat, why would this stop the process of ketosis?</p>
","<p>The general recommendation against vegetable oil has nothing to do with the oil source. The usual complain is that vegetable oils are perceived as ""highly processed"" and thus ""not natural"". Which of course is not true. You can't treat extra virgin olive oil same as margarine (aka ""hardened vegetable oil""). There are many crappy products made from unspecified ""vegetable oil"", but it doesn't mean that all oils coming from plants are bad.</p>

"What effects does an oxygen saturation between 90% and 94% have on the body?","4071","","<p>Many different sources note that normal oxygen saturation for healthy people is 95% or higher. Oxygen saturation below 90% or other sources 88%, is considered low. </p>

<p>What possible symptoms or impact on the body could be happening as a result of having an oxygen saturation between the normal and low levels. </p>
","<p>Reduced oxygen saturation in blood is called hypoxia (though strictly that means reduced oxygen in the tissues). If there is marked reduction in oxygen saturation of blood, it may lead to bluish discoloration of skin and tongue, called cyanosis. </p>

<p>Mildly reduced arterial oxygen saturation may be due to mild respiratory or cardiac diseases. A common lung condition is chronic obstructive airway disease (or chronic bronchitis, most commonly due to smoking). Congenital cyanotic heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot are generally discovered and treated in childhood. Arterio-venous malformations in lung is another cause of arterial oxygen desaturation which may be present in otherwise healthy persons. Persons staying at high altitudes have reduced blood oxygen saturation due to low atmospheric pressure leading to reduced partial pressure of oxygen in inhaled air. Sleep apnea syndrome often seen in obese persons may also lead to hypoxia. Other causes include neurological diseases leading to respiratory depression, respiratory conditions such as severe pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (clots in arteries supplying blood to the lungs), pulmonary edema (lung congestion), pulmonary fibrosis etc, but in all these the person is obviously ill. </p>

<p>In an apparently healthy person, mild hypoxia is likely to be due to smoking or pollution related chronic obstructive airway (pulmonary) disease (COAD or COPD), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation or early pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

<p>Mild hypoxia may not result in any symptoms. It may lead to increased hemoglobin level in the blood to compensate for reduced oxygen saturation, as commonly occurs in persons living at high altitudes. The main worry is that the underlying process may progress and hence the cause of desaturation should be investigated.</p>

"What are known health effects of smoking e-cigarettes","3981","","<p>E-Cigarettes have been recommended by a fair share of physicians as a substitute for cigarettes because they are supposedly healthier.</p>

"Can pregnancy lead to growing taller?","3932","","<p>In an adult that has finished growing, is it possible to grow more during pregnancy?</p>

<p>I've been assured this is possible by some relatives, and also a friend who swears she grew an extra inch when pregnant with her first child at 25 years old, well after puberty was over. Their theory is that the various hormones growing the baby also help the mother grow a bit.</p>
","<p>It's possible, but don't count on it. </p>

<p>Amazingly, there isn't really much in the literature about this that I could find - most studies focus on maternal <em>weight</em>, not <em>height</em>. While the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, you'd think some of these dozens (or rather hundreds) of studies would have noticed women not only putting on weight, but also growing in height... </p>

<p>Even <a href=""http://www.naturalheightgrowth.com/2012/10/22/analysis-on-the-possible-cause-for-height-increase-during-pregnancy/"" rel=""nofollow"">sites featuring speculation on this</a> put the occurrence of it happening as very low, <a href=""http://www.naturalheightgrowth.com/2013/07/13/another-case-of-pregnancy-causing-woman-to-grow-taller-and-increase-in-height/"" rel=""nofollow"">less than a 0.1 percent</a>. Please note that as far as I can see, that site doesn't offer a citation even for this low number, just some women reporting it. On other websites, <a href=""http://www.healthboards.com/boards/womens-health/561081-height-loss-post-pregnancy-normal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">other recent mothers</a> that they grew <em>shorter</em> during pregnancy. </p>

<p>As an example from the established literature, the study <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199801153380302"" rel=""nofollow"">Prepregnancy Weight and the Risk of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes</a> studied weight gain and loss in a large number of women (over 100,000) </p>

"How much Vitamin B12 do you need?","3749","","<p>Vitamin B12 is stored over a very long time such that vegans, for example, only get any signs or symptoms of B12 deficiency after a span of years, even though they have hardly any sources of the vitamin in their diets.</p>

<p>The dose required daily to prevent disease seems to vary dramatically, or maybe it is very hard to determine accurately. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>This <a href=""http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer/"">site</a> says pregnant women need less than 3 micrograms (µg)/day (where pregnant women need more than non-pregnant women).</li>
<li>A friend of mine got her blood values in order by ingesting 7 µg/day.     </li>
<li>My apothecary person told me 500-1000 µg per day are needed to even start absorbing meaningful quantities by ingestion.   </li>
<li>My doctor prescribed 200 µg/day for me. </li>
</ul>

<p>Another factor is that apparently your intestinal bacteria determine the rate of absorption. </p>

<p>So what is the amount of B12 needed per day? Please note that this is not about deficient absorption, where the amount would be above what healthy people need. </p>
","<p>The estimated daily requirement needed to maintain body stores of B12 varies, an estimate being from 2µg to 5µg, more if stores have been depleted in any way. It is estimated that the average person stores about 1 mg (1000 µg) of B12 in their liver, and other smaller amounts elsewhere. The recommended daily allowance assumes a 50% absorption rate of ingested B12.</p>

<p>This is a good question to discuss the limits of medical science. How is the requirement for B12 determined?</p>

<p><em>Longitudinal studies</em> are those that follow people over many years (even decades.) Humans are not subjected to longitudinal studies involving, say, B12 because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it would be <strong>unethical</strong> to withhold from some subjects a vitamin necessary for health and well-being while providing it to others just to get an exact number (for the sake of scientific curiosity)</li>
<li>there are ethical issues in involvement of the young (parental consent should not extend to potential harm)</li>
<li>if participants are paid volunteers, the study introduces a bias in recruitment (more poor people?) This affects the ability to generalize to the total population, because there may be inherent risks of confounding variables</li>
<li>the cost of such a study would be prohibitive (who will collect the data, control the diets, pay for the food, and determine outcomes, etc.)</li>
<li>it is impossible to regulate someone's diet for years or decades (one person sneaking out to eat a dozen oysters could ruin the experiment)  </li>
<li>it would be unethical to control someone's diet for decades (what if someone who signed up for the study later became a vegan on moral grounds? They would either be forced to eat meat or drop out of the study) </li>
<li>longitudinal studies suffer from cumulative attrition - people die of unrelated causes, move to another area, decide to drop out for other reasons, etc.</li>
<li>(many more problems)</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore different study models must be used, which give us less accurate information, such as retrospective studies, animal studies, studies of treatment of pernicious anemia (a result of B12 deficiency), pregnant and lactating vegans, people who have undergone certain bypass procedures, etc. By studying those patients, it can be determined how much B12 is necessary to the first signs of B12 deficiency away (usually apparent in blood).</p>

<p>B12 is a particularly difficult vitamin to pin down because of its
complexity, the fact that it is synthesized by intestinal flora, and the various steps involved in its absorption which might be influenced by age and other factors.</p>

<p>Again, the estimated daily requirement of B12 varies from ~ 2µg to 5µg.</p>

<p>Since there are no known adverse effects of excess B12 intake, it's not unreasonable to take more than the minimum if warranted. However, a recommendation of 500 - 1000 µg/day seems quite unnecessary.</p>

<br/><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sm6oH.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">(A snapshot of my endeavors)</a></p>

<p>In my opinion it is better to use capsule since it will protect the bacteria from the acid environment in the stomach. But then I'm skeptical about that: if the powder form is useless, why does it exist?</p>
","<p>I cannot answer your question directly, but explaining some general considerations might help to clarify what would be a sound choosing approach.</p>

<p>When you say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In my opinion it is better to use capsule since it will protect the bacteria from the acid environment in the stomach.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>bear in mind that this applies to <strong>gastro-resistant</strong> capsules only:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Gastro-resistant capsules are delayed-release capsules
  that are intended to resist the gastric fluid and to release
  their active substance or substances in the intestinal fluid.
  Usually they are prepared by filling capsules with granules
  or with particles covered with a gastro-resistant coating or
  in certain cases, by providing hard or soft capsules with a
  gastro-resistant shell (enteric capsules).</em> (<a href=""http://lib.njutcm.edu.cn/yaodian/ep/EP5.0/07_monographs_on_dosage_forms/Capsules.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Ph.Eur.5.0.</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many manufacturers of probiotics use hard (gelatine) capsules which are not resistant to stomach acid. In fact these two sorts of capsules have to comply with different pharmacopoeial requirements: </p>

<p><em>Gastro-resistant capsules</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Disintegration</strong>. For capsules with a gastro-resistant shell carry out the test for disintegration [...] use 0.1 M hydrochloric acid as the liquid
  medium and operate the apparatus for 2 h, or other such time as may be authorised, without the discs. Examine the state of the capsules.<strong>The time of resistance to the acid medium</strong> varies according to the formulation of the capsules to be examined. It is typically 2 h to 3 h but even with authorised deviations it <strong>must not be less than 1 h. No capsule shows signs of disintegration or rupture permitting the escape of the contents.</em></strong> (Ph.Eur.5.0)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas for <em>hard capsules</em> it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Use water R as the liquid medium. When justified and authorised, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid or artificial gastric juice R may be used as the liquid medium. [...] Operate the apparatus <strong>for 30 min</strong>, unless otherwise justified and authorised and examine the state of the capsules. <strong>The capsules comply with
  the test if all 6 have disintegrated.</em></strong> (Ph.Eur.5.0)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some strains of probiotics are found to be <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151822/#r27"" rel=""nofollow"">acid resistant</a> which can be enhanced by formulation factors other than gastro-resistant coating. On the other hand, manufacturers of probiotics in gastro-resistant capsules often state (on their websites e.g.) that they deliver more units of probiotic bacteria to the intestines than conventional dosage forms. (It may depend on the strains they use.) Some probiotics can be found in yoghourt which is definitely not gastro-resistant. </p>

<p>Regulatory requirements are much stricter for medicines than for supplements in most countries, so if one is concerned with the sufficient drug delivery and the accuracy of medical claims, it is useful to know that for medicines to be approved for marketing much firmer evidence about these (and other concerns) has to be submitted.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why does powder exist as a dosage form? There may be several reasons to produce and market oral powder as a dosage form: some people have difficulties to swallow capsules, it may depend on manufacturer's production line, powders allow for <strong>individualised</strong> dosage (measuring the dose for a specific patient - but I don't think this would be necessary with probiotics), hygroscopic excipients which are incompatible with capsule shell etc. </p>

<p>The dose you take in powder <strong>is not more precise</strong> - even if it is sold in divided doses (each dose in one bag), because a small amount of powder can always remain on the walls. The precision of measurement is the same at best, if not in favour of the capsules.</p>

<h2>How to chose?</h2>

<p>Here are some of the questions that should be taken into account:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the patient allergic/intolerant to any of the formulation's ingredients?</li>
<li>Is there a form preferred by the patient's physician, for some medical reason?</li>
<li>Which form is the most convenient one for you?</li>
<li>Which form is accessible and affordable to you?</li>

"Does eating sweet after food help to digest large meals?","3494","","<p>I've heard that if you eat sweets after big foods, your stomach gets the energy needed to digest and probably bigger part of your lunch will get digested (so it won't transform to fat).</p>

<p>Are there any reliable studies on this topic?</p>
","<p>It might speed up digestion:</p>

<p><a href=""http://tidsskriftet.no/article/2182039"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tidsskriftet.no/article/2182039</a></p>

<p>But speeding up digestion isn't going to bring you the outcome you desire. Also, a larger amount of simple sugars is more likely to lead to increased energy stored in adipose tissue (fat cells).</p>

<p>Big foods - those with larger, more complex molecules with stronger molecular bonds - such as more complex carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, take longer to digest, and a combination of these and fibre further slow the overall process, meaning that the energy being released into blood-sugar will be less likely to become surplus to requirements and lead to those larger spikes in blood-sugar levels which trigger storage.</p>

<p>There are things you can do to stimulate or assist the digestive system, like chewing well to start the process, ingesting bitter foods and drinks to stimulate bile, a shot of vinegar if you have low stomach acidity, or even the sort of enzymes you find in things like lactose free milk which contains lactase (although this turns a disaccharides into two more quickly absorbed monosacharides so it's only really recommended for those who are lactose intolerant). A high fibre diet will also improve your intestinal flora long term, as well as it's short term effects on digestion.</p>

<p>Technically an unhealthy and under-active digestive system would be more likely lead to less fat, as the body loses some of the ability to absorb macro and/or micro nutrients, meaning they pass through the system.</p>

<p>In a depleted state, such as after prolonged starvation, or in a diabetic crash, a quick sugar hit might be needed to kick-start the system, but in general the body can easily find the energy it needs, especially for a process as slow and steady as the average 24 hours it takes to digest a meal.</p>

<p>There are things which can reduce cholesterol re-absorption, such as increased fibre, medication, or supplements (although I've heard plant sterols as a supplement can be Sisyphean). Excess cholesterol isn't really about energy though.</p>

"Is ""smokers lungs"" a lie?","3494","","<p>We've probably all seen photos of smokers' lungs compared to non-smokers lungs. For example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3HtZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3HtZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>These images are commonly used in anti-smoking materials, at least in the US, and I've never had cause to question them. However, <a href=""https://cfrankdavis.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/the-black-lung-lie/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this guy</a> claims the images are a lie. He cites seemingly credible sources for his claim, such as these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dr. Duane Carr – Professor of Surgery at the University of Tennessee
  College of Medicine, said this: “Smoking does not discolor the lung.”</p>
  
  <p>Dr. Victor Buhler, Pathologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Kansas City:
  “I have examined thousands of lungs both grossly and microscopically.
  I cannot tell you from exmining a lung whether or not its former host
  had smoked.”

  <p>Dr. Sheldon Sommers, Pathologist and Director of Laboratories at Lenox
  Hill Hospital, in New York: “…it is not possible grossly or
  microscopically, or in any other way known to me, to distinguish
  between the lung of a smoker or a nonsmoker. Blackening of lungs is
  from carbon particles, and smoking tobacco does not introduce carbon
  particles into the lung.”
  <a href=""http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/moh18c00/pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author militantly believes that smokers are treated unfairly and so clearly has an agenda, which lowers his credibility. I also find it difficult to believe that thousands of pathologists and thoracic surgeons would quietly allow such blatant distortions to go unchallenged even if they do feel that the ""scare factor"" makes the lie justifiable.</p>

<p>However, I find it surprising that I can't find compelling evidence to prove the blogger is wrong. I can find no credible sources confirming the black appearance of smokers' lungs, and all the photos I can find are the same small set of images recycled so many times it's impossible to know where they came from originally. I've also confirmed that it's true that smokers are accepted as lung donors, and it seems difficult to believe that would be the case if they were routinely as grossly damaged as they appear to be in these images.  </p>

<p>So my question is: Are smokers' lungs visibly and routinely blackened and/or discolored in the absence of lung disease?</p>

  <p>So my question is: Are smokers' lungs visibly and routinely blackened and/or discolored in the absence of lung disease?</p>

<p>That last phrase is tricky, because smokers who have heavy pigmentation are likely to have lung disease.</p>

<p>It is not a myth that smokers have black pigmentation in their lungs, but finding proof of gross pathology in picture form is difficult. </p>

<p>Here is one slide from <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/smokers_lung_pathology_photo_essay/page3.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">MedicineNet</a></p>

<p>This is gross (visible to the naked eye) pathology, and you can see dark pigmentation in the region of emphesematous blebs.</p>

<p>What is <em>not</em> difficult to find are histopathology slides, and many of them show pigment-laden macrophages in smoker's lungs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A correlation was found between degree of <em>cytoplasmic pigmentation of macrophages</em> and number of pack-years smoked and also between the presence of peribronchiolar fibrosis and number of pack-years.

All occurred in never-smokers, and their significance is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again in <a href=""http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196%2812%2965379-8/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">another paper</a> on RB in <em>young</em> smokers,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Respiratory bronchiolitis is a mild inflammatory reaction commonly noted in asymptomatic cigarette smokers. We reviewed 18 cases of respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB/ILD), which had been diagnosed on the basis of clinical evaluation and open-lung biopsy. All patients were cigarette smokers. The sex distribution of the patients was approximately equal, and their mean age was <em>36 years</em>. Chest roentgenograms showed reticular or reticulonodular infiltrates in 72% of the patients. <em>Histologically, inflammation of the respiratory bronchioles, filling of the bronchiolar lumens and surrounding alveoli with finely pigmented macrophages...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, I spoke with two county coroner employed pathologists who stated without hesitation that heavy pigmentation was present grossly in heavy smokers, and that without knowing if a person was a smoker or non-smoker, they were able to predict with accuracy who was a heavy smoker. Furthermore, I was invited to come take pictures of lungs on autopsy (going through the proper channels and with the families' permission) of smokers and nonsmokers to authenticate the difference (That won't help with the bounty, of course).</p>

<p>Given all this, I don't believe that there is a medical conspiracy about smokers' lungs looking the way they do.</p>

"Risks of blood donation with autoimmune diseases","3309","","<p>People with autoimmune diseases are generally either forbidden or discouraged from donating blood. Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who have autoimmune diseases (such as autoimmune thyroid disease, ankylosing spondylitis) are advised not to donate blood. This is because there is a small risk of causing immune system disturbance and symptomatic disease in patients who receive blood from donors with autoimmune diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.hsa.gov.sg/pub/faq/faq/faqcategory/blood-donation.aspx"">source</a></p>

<p>Is there any more information in the literature about the cases? I'm especially interested in the ""causing symptomatic disease in patients who receive blood"" part. </p>
","<p>The World Health Organization published a report entitled <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK138218/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK138218.pdf"">Blood Donor Selection: Guidelines on Assessing Donor Suitability for Blood Donation</a>. Based on a review of scientific studies and other literature, it contains detailed recommendations for establishing blood donation programs, including which donors to accept or reject.</p>

<p>It mentions several autoimmune diseases. From the non-communicable section (page 49), we have</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>5.1.4 Thrombocytopenia</strong><br>
  Individuals with thrombocytopenia should not be accepted as blood donors
  because of the risk of bleeding at the venepuncture site and because chronic
  thrombocytopenia may be associated with serious underlying haematological or
  other systemic disease. A past history of autoimmune thrombocytopenia is not
  a contraindication to blood donation, even if treated by splenectomy, provided
  that the prospective donor has been well for five years with no evidence of
  relapse (64).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The specific reason for rejection here is twofold: The possibility of bleeding and of a secondary, more serious condition. The first risk, however, is common for all haematological disease. The section references a selection of guidelines from the UK Blood Transfusion &amp; Tissue Transplantation Services.</p>

<p>There is a full section dedicated to ""Immunological diseases"" (which presumably encompasses autoimmune diseases) (page 57):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>5.6 IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES</strong><br>
  Individuals with systemic immunological diseases are generally unwell and are
  therefore not suitable to donate blood. Donors should be questioned about severe
  allergy to materials used in blood collection, such as latex or skin disinfectant, so that contact with these materials can be avoided. Passive transfer of IgE by blood transfusion has been reported but does not alter acceptance criteria (129,130,131).</p>
  
  <p>While there is no evidence of harm resulting from blood donation by individuals with a history of anaphylaxis, the permanent deferral of such individuals is recommended as a precautionary measure (70).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the recommendation stems mostly from the assumption that these diseases are severe, and could thus cause serious harm to the recipients of these donors' blood. The referenced sources are three studies on the potential transferability of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"">IgE</a>, and one general set of blood donor recommendations.</p>

<p>A later section discusses general central nervous system diseases (page 58):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>5.8 CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASES</strong><br>
  Assessment of the suitability of prospective donors with central nervous system
  conditions should take into account the well-being of the donor and the risk of
  transfusion-transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is recommended that almost all donors with central nervous system diseases (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, etc.) be deferred, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lack of full understanding of the cause of the disease (see the section on multiple sclerosis)</li>
<li>A fear that blood donation could lead to adverse effects on the donor (see the section on epilepsy)</li>
<li>The possibility of the transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these have not yet been supported by studies, although attempts have been made to prove/disprove them. The primary concern is that some variants of these diseases are not well-known enough, and there could be adverse effects that physicians are not aware of. This is a concern I've seen cited on various websites of blood donation programs.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a generic section on medications (page 64). This harkens back to the deferral of some donors with thrombocytopenia, insofar as currently having the disease can make one ineligible for donation. In these cases, the medication could be transferred through the blood, thus possible harming the recipient:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>6.2 MEDICATIONS</strong><br>
  Deferral criteria for medications taken by donors should take into account the
  underlying condition for which the medication is taken, the pharmacokinetic
  properties of the medication and the effect of the medication on the quality
  or safety of the donated blood (146,147,148). Donors should not omit regular
  medication in order to attend a blood donor session.</p>
  
  <p>There is no published evidence that medications in donated blood have caused
  adverse effects in a patient receiving transfusion, although it is unlikely that
  such events would be recognized. European Union legislation requires temporary
  deferral based on the “nature and mode of action” of the medication (149).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, though this possibility has been studied, there is little evidence to back it up. Blood donation programs are advised to defer these potential donors in some cases out of caution.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are <em>some</em> autoimmune diseases which will not automatically prohibit blood donation. Among these are asthma and some cases of rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism. These are the less severe autoimmune diseases, and they are also well-known and treatable, meaning that some of the risks mentioned earlier don't apply to them.</p>

"How fast and effective does an epi-pen work against a peanut allergy reaction?","3305","","<p>Last night, I read a horror story about a baseball coach who assaulted his star player after training because she made his son look bad as the eternal number 2.  He fed her peanuts while she had a nut allergy twice and then forced himself on her. There were several minutes between the time she was first fed the nuts and when she managed to use her epi-pen, at least enough time for her coach to feed her a second handful of nuts, drag her into the announcer's area and violate her.</p>

<p>What I found weird was that she started feeling better instantly and managed to overpower the coach, run away, ambush him and beat him to death with her baseball bat in a few minutes. She also didn't go to the hospital afterwards to get further treatment for the reaction.</p>

<p>I thought that an epi-pen needed more time to work, especially if there's also the stress from the simultaneous assault. I also thought that an epi-pen is not a magic health potion that removes the entire problem instantly and removes the need for a hospital visit to at least check up on things.</p>

<p>Does an epi-pen really work in this way, or was this a severe case of artistic license: medicine?</p>
","<p>Mild case of artistic license. </p>

<p>The effects of epinephrine are rapid and can be dramatic, but <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/epipen-drug/consumer-uses.htm"">they're not long-lasting</a>. EpiPens are only intended as a delaying tactic to buy time for the patient to get to more definitive medical care. </p>

<p>But how much that matters depends on the severity of the reaction. If someone had a relatively mild reaction and used an EpiPen, could they continue to function and recover without medical care? Yes, absolutely, especially if their exposure was limited. EpiPens didn't always exist, after all, and anaphylaxis has never been 100% fatal.</p>

<p>But if the character was portrayed as having a severe, potentially lethal allergy to peanuts and was force-fed handfuls of them, I would expect her to spend days in the hospital, quite possibly in an ICU. She might manage to run or put up a fight for a while, but not for long.</p>

<p>Portraying epinephrine as a magic potion was definitely artistic license.</p>

<p>On Nutrition Facts labels in the US, almost every major category of nutrient has a daily value. Sugars, which appears in many foods, has no daily value recommendation. I find this rather surprising, especially because of how much sugar impacts the nutritional value of a food. </p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm274593.htm"">the FDA website</a>, no daily reference value has been established for sugars because no recommendations have been made for the total amount of sugar to eat in a day. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the sugar values listed do not distinguish between naturally occurring and added sugars, because it is not a chemically meaningful distinction. So unlike nutritional information about vitamins, proteins, fats, etc, there really is no level of ""recommended sugar"" that would make a good blanket statement for everyone. </p>

<p>Claims that high consumption of added sugars harmful to your health is an extremely complicated subject. It's not that the sugar itself is inherently harmful due to any of its chemical properties; it's just that added sugar tends to be in products that have extremely high fat and high calorie content, and are easy to consume in large quantities.</p>

<p>So saying to avoid foods high in added sugars is good general advice. But labeling products to indicate that you should consume {x} amount of sugar per day was <strong><em>not</em></strong> a piece of nutritional guidance the FDA was prepared to make in that labeling.</p>

","<p>From what I can gather after reading through several different sites in a search, it will depend somewhat on the type of alcohol (I am assuming schnapps) and the method used to turn it into alcohol.</p>

<p>Archer appears to make liqueur type schnapps, which means that the fruit is steeped in the alcohol base, rather than distilled from the fruit itself. This means it will have a higher sugar content, and will go bad faster.</p>

<p>As near as I can tell, there isn't any adverse health effects reported from drinking out of date alcohol, but the taste can vary wildly, and be anything from a ""flat"" taste, to very harsh and bitter as the sugars continue to break down.

<p>If it does weaken it, how can one keep the immune system strong while the person is infected with a cold?</p>
","<p>I've written on this subject a few times, but the most <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4456/in-a-viral-infection-which-symptoms-are-caused-by-the-virus-itself-and-which-s/4528#4528"">relevant question</a> ended up being closed, and the other is on <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21507/why-dont-we-develop-immunity-against-common-cold/21802#21802"">Bio.SE</a>, so I will mostly focus on tailoring the information there to the specifics of this question.</p>

<p>If you look at ether of my previous answers, you will note the first thing we need to establish is what is causing the common cold.  From the body of evidence coming from the <a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jrm/2014/469393/"" rel=""nofollow"">US</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321179"" rel=""nofollow"">China</a> I believe the answer to that is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"" rel=""nofollow"">HRV</a> followed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus"" rel=""nofollow"">RSV</a>.</p>

<p>Your immune system is actually <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26557722"" rel=""nofollow"">directly attacked</a> by two of the proteins RSV makes when it infects cells (NS1 and NS2).  This knowledge is actually linked to a pretty cool <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249281"" rel=""nofollow"">vaccine idea</a> for RSV.  Thus I think it quite appropriate to think that active RSV infections weaken your immune system.</p>

<p>Looking at the very good epidemiology data coming from China (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3750056/"" rel=""nofollow"">here's another example</a> in addition to the first), it seems that the rate of co-infection, that is something else besides these two viruses infecting the patient, is quite high, particularity with RSV.  This would imply that other pathogens take advantaged of a ""weakened"" immune system in an RSV infection.</p>

<p>It's less clear with HRV, but that might just be because of how amazingly common HRV infections are.  It <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23806456"" rel=""nofollow"">seems</a> as though HRV induces a good <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767874"" rel=""nofollow"">immune response</a>, in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122508"" rel=""nofollow"">healthy patients</a>, but it was still commonly found with other pathogens present (though not in rates as high as RSV).  There is not a clear mechanism for HRV if it is in fact weakening the immune system (which actually might be better described as a ""distracted"" immune system in this case).</p>

<p>As for what you can do?  Not a whole lot once symptoms show up.  Contrary to whatever ads you may see, even some <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10543583"" rel=""nofollow"">poor un-blinded trials</a>, taking vitamin C is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010554"" rel=""nofollow"">not going to help</a> after you <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440782"" rel=""nofollow"">already have the cold</a>.  Even the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17636648"" rel=""nofollow"">prophylactic benefit</a> seems to only be in certain cases, and I want to strongly discourage megadosing vitamin C, which in most cases does nothing helpful (and can <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7008359"" rel=""nofollow"">cause problems</a> of it's own).</p>

<p>Staying hydrated is always a good option, as is washing your hands and coughing/sneezing into your elbow to prevent infecting others.  Other than that, you can hope for any of the vaccine candidates currently be researched to actually work, or that one of the small molecule inhibitors (anti-viral drugs) to actually be safe.</p>

Why does that information not appear to be provided?","3135","","<p>I recently discovered <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerade#cite_ref-USA_Today_article_5-0"" rel=""nofollow"">Powerade Zero</a>, which apparently has zero sugar / zero calories and is artificially sweetened by sucralose.</p>

<p>Normally when I'm concerned about sugar content (which is basically all the time, because nearly everything has loads of sugar in it nowadays) I check the nutritional information, and it's always there, Sugars ... <em>x</em> grams.</p>

<p>But with sucralose, there's no line for it in the nutrition label. I can find it in the ingredients list of course, but there's no indication of quantity.</p>

<p>I have three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How much sucralose does Powerade Zero contain?</p></li>
<li><p>Why isn't the quantity provided in the nutrition label (for sucralose as well as many other ingredients)? Does the absence of quantity information mean that it's not significant / shouldn't be a concern?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any way for a random ignoramus like me to get this information without having to ask this question on Stack Exchange and wait/hope for an expert to answer?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sucralose</a> is considered to be a non nutritive sweetener, since the body does not break down the majority of the sucralose molecule. Because of that, it's considered to be non caloric, so it won't be included under the nutrition information.</p>

<p>As far as the quantity, there is no requirement under FDA regulations that the specific amounts be listed, and would probably violate copyright patents, as then people could duplicate the formula. As pointed out in <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/283/how-do-you-read-a-us-nutrition-label"">the top answer here</a>, ingredients are listed in order of percentage, so the ingredient that makes up the most of the product is listed first, the next second, etc.</p>

<p>As far as finding out, many search engines and product reviews may help, as it is just legwork and patience that will get you the information that you need (in most cases).</p>

<p>However, there have been some recent <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262475.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cautions against sucralose</a>, since an Italian study showed a link between increased cancer risk with <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/244603.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">increased consumption of sucralose</a> (as well as aspartame).

"Does having more muscles influence blood pressure measurement?","2930","","<p>As stated in the title, do we have any evidence that having a big muscular arm influence BP measurement?</p>
","<p>There is evidence that a muscular arm will produce a higher systolic reading if the wrong sized cuff is applied.</p>

<p>There are two measurements in a blood pressure reading, the systolic and the diastolic. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the first number in a reading (Such as the 120 in 120/60), and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the second number.</p>

<p>The method for taking an arm blood pressure is to wrap the cuff around the upper arm, place the stethoscope over the brachial artery, and inflate the cuff until you cannot hear any sounds. Slowly bleed the air out of the cuff, and note the number when the first sound appears, and when the sound disappears to get your reading.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593118"">study I refer to above</a> was performed at a Mexican bodybuilding competition. When a medium cuff was used, the SBP was significantly higher than with the larger cuff. Blood pressure overall was slightly lower with the correct sized cuff as well.</p>

<p>So while being muscular is not really a factor, clinicians should be aware of using the correct sized cuff to avoid artificially inflated blood pressure readings.</p>

Like a year ago (I was 16) I expierenced stress just as a short warming up of my shoulders. For the last year or so, I expierence it more like a lot of very small stings seemingly randomly appearing everywhere all over my body. Is there a name for this condition?</p>
","<p><strong>Paresthesia Anxiety Symptoms</strong> -- seems like the term/condition you are looking for <em>(though I am not a doctor and am not diagnosing you as such -- I'm just trying to inform you of the term you might be looking for).</em></p>

<p>In this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia entry on Paresthesia</a>, it describes the sensation as such: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paresthesia is an <strong>abnormal sensation</strong> such as <strong>tingling, tickling,
  pricking, numbness or burning</strong> of a person's skin with no apparent
  physical cause. The manifestation of a paresthesia may be transient or
  chronic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't use the word ""stinging"" as you do so I'm not sure if this fits the bill, but it does go on to describe how it can be quite sporadic and painful. Other articles also have used the word ""stinging"" in reference to Parethesia. </p>

<p>This CalmClinic article <a href=""http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/symptoms/needles-and-pins"" rel=""noreferrer"">""4 Ways to Prevent Pins and Needles From Anxiety""</a>, does a pretty good job of <strong>correlating how stress and anxiety are strongly linked to Parethesia</strong> (the stinging, tingling, burning, pins-and-needles sensation). I'm not sure if your stress leads to anxiety and sometimes panic attacks that include hyperventilation, but if so, here is an explanation as to why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During hyperventilation, the body has too much oxygen and not enough
  carbon dioxide. That imbalance causes every vessel inside the body to
  constrict, while simultaneously reducing the release of calcium into
  the nerves. Both of these cause the nerves to feel ""tingly.""</p>
  
  <p>Those with
  anxiety are also prone to hyperventilating more as a result of their
  hyperventilation. Hyperventilation can cause symptoms of not getting
  enough air (shortness of breath) which makes people breathe in deeper.
  But that deeper breathing is actually counterproductive, since too
  much oxygen is the cause of hyperventilation. This makes the symptoms
  get worse, and increases the likelihood of tingling.</p>
  
  <p>Hyperventilation
  is one of the main causes of panic attack and severe anxiety symptoms,
  and the pins and needles feeling is undoubtedly one of the most
  troublesome for those unaware of their breathing patterns. Not
  everyone experiences the same sensation either. Some people feel pain,
  while others feel a tickling. Some people may experience different
  sensations at different times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BUT do keep in mind that there are other reasons for this sensation to develop, even different stress and anxiety reasons (if you're not necessarily hyperventilating):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Other Links Between Anxiety and Pins and Needles</strong> Those with anxiety and those that suffer from anxiety attacks are also more prone
  to body consciousness. They become over-sensitive to every sensation
  their body makes, and unintentionally overthink the causes of those
  experiences.Feet, arms, fingers, and legs, all may fall asleep due to
  pressure on the nerves. For a person without anxiety, this experience
  is rarely given a second thought. To a person with anxiety, this
  experience can cause a significant amount of distress – enough to make
  someone worry about their health.In addition, dehydration and other
  less serious diseases may also create a tingling feeling in the limbs
  as well as anxiety. If you have an anxiety disorder, you may be more
  likely to react very strongly to these sensations until you experience
  an anxiety attack.</p>

"Not taking bath or shower when sick","2723","","<p>My parents would not let me to take a showers or take a bath because they claimed it would make you even more sick.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any evidence that taking a bath or shower when sick has negative effects?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>Is there any evidence that taking a bath or shower when sick has negative effects?</strong></p>

<p>This is quite interesting because I've heard MANY patients with this same belief. Some people believe that bathing when sick will make you more sick. Some women do not bathe during their menstrual period because their mothers told them it would lead to some adverse effects. Even some mothers who just gave birth do not take a bath in the immediate post-partum period because they believe it will be harmful. </p>

<p>In all the medical books I've read, I've never encountered one that cautions against bathing when someone is sick. I also searched PubMed just now and I didn't find a study that details the negative effects of bathing during a sickness. On the contrary, there are a lot of studies that encourages people to bathe during illness, especially when they are febrile. In fact, it is a common practice in the medical profession to advise patients to have a sponge bath when their temperature is up. Aside from the cooling effect of bathing, it also cleans the body and prevents the spread of infection.</p>

<p>The only situations I could think of when I would advise patients to not take a bath is when a patient is too weak to stand up and take a bath or is at risk of falling by doing so. But then again, these patients can still have sponge baths in their bed. What they're not allowed is to ambulate, but they're allowed to bathe. Also, if patients have skin lesions or contraptions that shouldn't be wet; but then again, these can easily be covered by waterproof dressings and the patient can still take a bath. The last thing I could think of why I wouldn't allow a patient to bathe is when a patient is hypothermic (or has low body temperature). But then again, they can have warm baths instead. So overall, I really couldn't think of a reason--and I haven't read any--why baths can worsen illnesses.</p>

<p>I got interested to know the source of this belief, and I've come across this article. <a href=""http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/why-bathing-was-uncommon-in-medieval-europe/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/why-bathing-was-uncommon-in-medieval-europe/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before the Middle Ages, public baths were very common, as was the
  general public regularly taking time to bathe in one way or another.
  Even during the 4th and 5th centuries, Christian authorities allowed
  people to bathe for cleanliness and health, but condemned attendance
  to public bath houses for pleasure and condemned women going to bath
  houses that had mixed facilities. However, over time, more and more
  restrictions appeared. Eventually, Christians were prohibited from
  bathing naked and, overall, the church began to not approve an
  “excessive” indulgence in the habit of bathing. This culminated in the
  Medieval church authorities proclaiming that public bathing led to
  immorality, promiscuous sex, and diseases.</p>
  
  <p>This latter “disease” point was very common;
  it was believed in many parts of Europe that water could carry disease
  into the body through the pores in the skin. According to one medical
  treaty of the 16th century, “Water baths warm the body, but weaken the
  organism and widen pores.  That’s why they can be dangerous and cause
  different diseases, even death.”  It wasn’t just diseases from the
  water itself they were worried about.  They also felt that with the
  pores widened after a bath, this resulted in infections of the air
  having easier access to the body.</p>

<p>Interesting, right?
Anyway, if you find a logical, scientific explanation for the harmful effect of bathing during an illness, please tag me. I'd like to know it too.</p>

<p>For example, when hip is doing external rotation (30° with the hip extended, 50° with the hip flexed), it's using the gluteal muscles including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliopsoas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iliopsoas</a> (combination of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoas_major_muscle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">psoas major</a> and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliacus_muscle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iliacus</a> at their inferior ends).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ylwvjm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Would this disappear by itself (it's already over a month)?</p>
","<p>What you have is called a subungual hematoma; that's just a fancy way of saying <em>a collection of blood under the nail</em>. It may happen with any kind of direct trauma, including (perhaps the worst?) a broken toe. It is similar to any other injury causing bleeding; the major difference is you can actually see the dark blood because the nail is transparent.</p>

<p>Yes, it will disappear by itself, but as already noted by @JohnP, it will take a long time, as the clotted, thickened blood residue will be pulled towards the tip of the toe at the same rate that your toenail grows. </p>

<p>This is a picture of a subungual hematoma (SUH) after six months of growth:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qacCU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>As you can see, there is a nice, normal nail growing out. I will hazard a guess that this particular injury was a lot like yours by the ridge formed across the top of the new nail. This indicates that the nail was lifted slightly off the nail plate. Also, this is a <em>very</em> slow growing nail.</p>

<p>Your SUH needs no treatment this far out. </p>

<p>As @JohnP noted, if there was significant injury to the growth plate, your nail may be permanently changed: it may be thicker, ridged, shorter, etc. But often this grows out without any problem.</p>

<p>Acute care includes ice and elevation. If very painful, most doctors are capable of trephining the SH under sterile conditions (burning a small hole in the nail through which the blood may escape.) This sounds much worse than it is; in actuality, it provides immediate relief.</p>

<p><sub>Because this was associated with trauma, it is a SUH. However, if it was not associated with trauma, one would need to consider a subungual melanoma, meaning a skin cancer under the nail. These can spread into adjacent soft tissue. Keep it in mind as it grows out; it should be replaced by fresh, unaffected nail.</sub> </p>

","<p>Urine is not sterile, not while in the bladder and certainly not when it comes out. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to dogma that urine is sterile in the absence of a clinical urinary tract infection (UTI); our research team and others have recently shown the existence of a urinary microbiota in individuals with and without lower urinary tract symptoms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16124436"">""Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country""</a> (note that while the paper itself is about people with ""Overactive Bladder syndrome"", the conclusion about urine not being sterile holds true for the control group in this study as well. </p>

<p>However, it is very unlikely you could get or give someone else some kind of disease through the kind of hypothetical contact you are talking about in your question. The South Australian health ministry for example lists only one disease potentially spread through urine : Cytomegalovirus <a href=""http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+topics/health+conditions+prevention+and+treatment/infectious+diseases/ways+infectious+diseases+spread"">[source]</a>. But while the test for this infection can be done through analysing urine, I could not find any evidence that there has ever been an infection that resulted from exposure to urine as opposed to saliva, semen or one of the other transmission routes. 
Another disease found in urine is typhoid :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16124436"">[""Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country""]</a>. Whether the level in these samples would be enough to lead to infection even if ingested is unclear to me. 
No substance in your urine is actively dangerous to you just by touching it. Even drinking it is generally considered to be safe, unless done too often (it does contain products your body is trying to get rid off). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> while urine’s purported healing properties have yet to be confirmed by rigorous research, drinking small amountsof your own urine is unlikely to produce serious harm if, for some reason, you are so inclined.<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16124436"">[source]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drying will possible reduce the amount of bacteria in the urine, just as it does for saliva. </p>

<p>In summary, no, urine is not sterile, but it also doesn't seem to be a ""usual"" route of infection for many (or maybe any) diseases. Furthermore,  having a spot of it dry on your clothes and a hypothetical person then touching it is bringing the infection risk down even more.</p>

<li>Wired mouse (as opposed to wireless) not only slows down the mouse but also restrains the mouse and forces the hand with having to extra-pull the mouse</li>

<li>A clean mouse bottom</li>
<li>A light mouse</li>
<li>Led of mouse that responds very efficiently</li>

<p>I wish there would be a hovering mouse. That would surely solve lots of problems.</p>

<p>Will keep on updating after I fix up my environment. It might take a while until I go shopping but I sure will update once I have news.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>As some suggested here, I started using the mouse with my left hand, which is also a great solution. Indeed a big challenge at first, but the advantages are not only health and no-pain, but I think it also develops the sensitivity of the left hand, wrist and fingers.</p>

"Does frequent showering change the amount of oils our skin produces?","2457","","<p>The skin produces natural oils, but when we shower, we remove those with water and wiping down. I'm wondering if our bodies adjust to the constant showering by producing oils faster. Sometimes, if I shower every day for a week, and then stop for a day, my head feels like it gets oily faster.</p>
","<h1>Shampooing</h1>

<p>The first synthetic shampoos were introduced in the 1930's and by '70s and '80s, daily shampooing became norm in the US. So shampooing in the modern sense (water to produce a soapy lather) is only about 100 years old.</p>

<p>Our modern shampoos are a combination of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"" rel=""nofollow"">surfactants</a> (such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate"" rel=""nofollow"">SLS</a>) which dissolve natural oils (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"" rel=""nofollow"">sebum</a>) and remove dirt particles. As result, it reduces the natural oils in your hair and scalp making it drier than usual, causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate.</p>

<p>According to some dermatologists, a gradual reduction in shampoo causes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"" rel=""nofollow"">sebaceous glands</a> to produce sebum at a slower rate resulting in less oil on the scalp and in the hair<sup><a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102062969"" rel=""nofollow"">2009</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you wash your hair every day, you're removing the sebum, then the oil glands compensate by producing more oil""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She recommends that patients wash their hair no more than two or three times a week.</p>

<p>In the 2010 book Packing for Mars, Soviet research said<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780393068474"" rel=""nofollow"">2010</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the skin halts its production of sebum—after five to seven days of not bathing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However this could vary greatly from person to person, as some people could respond better to some products with different concentrations of surfactants.</p>

<p>For example if you have ""oily hair"" you need a higher concentration of SLS to help dissolve the oils, when you have ""dry and frizzy hair"", it would exacerbate the problem.</p>

<p>In 2007 radio audition, Australian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Glover_(radio_presenter)"" rel=""nofollow"">Richard Glover</a> decided to challenge his audience to go without shampoo for six weeks. 86 percent of those who 500 people who participated reported that ""their hair was either better or the same""<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_poo"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Studies</h3>

<p>A <a href=""http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1997/cc048n02/p00117-p00121.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">study from 1997</a> showed a link between excessive oil production and anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Study was conducted in 120 men in order to quantify the effect of eight proprietary antidandruff shampoos on sebum flow dynamic.</p>
  
  <p>Two shampoos exhibited a significant effect upon the sebum follicular reservoir, steadily increasing the sebum excretion rate in time. One other product induced a significant decrease in sebum output.</p>
  
  <p>Only a few topical products are known to decrease the sebum output at the skin surface:</p>
  
  <p>Among them, the effect of progesterone, astringents, erythromycin-zinc complex, corticosteroids, and elubiol have been documented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For older studies, see: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4177572"" rel=""nofollow"">1968</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6580909"" rel=""nofollow"">1983</a></p>

<p>In 2013, the FDA announced that triclosan was found to affect hormone levels in animals<sup><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm205999.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">FDA</a></sup>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. However, data showing effects in animals don’t always predict effects in humans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A recent study from 2014 showed that shampooing impact on cortisol levels in human hair:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chemical processing and frequent shampooing affect cortisol levels measured in hair. Chemically processed or excessively shampooed hair should be avoided when recruiting subjects for hair cortisol studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on above it seems that chemical properties in modern shampoos can affect our hormones, however more studies needs to be conducted to see how exactly it affects our natural oil production (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"" rel=""nofollow"">sebum</a>).</p>

","<p>Your nose is impressively compressible! However, if you don't have any other problems, there's nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>You're young, and have less bone and more cartilage in your nose relative to it's size than adults have. If you find and press the noses of other kids your age, then do so with adults, you'll notice a significant difference between the adults and the kids, though not all of the kids' noses will flatten as much as yours.</p>

<p>Though noses are different, in this picture you can see a woman and a young child. Their noses are quite different in length. The baby's would be very compressible. The woman, not so much. </p>

<p>This is a young woman's nose with the underlying structures labeled. The septal cartilage, from the top almost to the bottom between the nostrils and the two upper lateral nasal cartilages fuse together and to the nasal bone. (The lower nasal cartilages don't fuse, so the tip of the nose always stays very flexible. Your lower nasal cartilages make up more of your nose than hers, so more of your nose is flexible.) </p>

<p>Your nose will be bendable depending on how long your nasal bone is - it's longer in some than in others, and it's longer in adults than kids. Your nasal bone - the really hard part that projects down from between your eyebrows - may be short, making your nose more compressible.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSuyk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I said in the beginning ""if you don't have any other problems"". Place your index finger on your upper lip and press hard enough that you can feel your teeth and gums. Now move your whole finger up toward the columulla (it separates the two nostrils on the outside.) Did you feel a hard bone above your lip (it's kind of triangle shaped with the base - against your lip - wider than the tip (which fuses with the septal cartilage.) If you don't have a bone there, you should ask your doctor to check your nose just in case.</p>

<p>Congenital anomalies of the nose are very rare and occur in 1/20,000
to 1/40,000 newborns, so it's highly unlikely you have one. Most of the time they are associated with other facial problems, for example a small chin (I can see yours, and it's fine). If you can breathe normally through your nose, and the only trick you can do with your body is to flatten your nose (great party trick!) you are just fine.</p>

<p>The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can vary per person it affects, and it can also depend on the the levels of exposure to each person.  The short answer would be <strong>yes</strong>, general fatigue and tiredness can be a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning. </p>

<p>I believe this is accurate for one being based on <strong>a symptom being weakness</strong>(2) which weakness can correlate to fatigue or tiredness.</p>

<p>Furthermore, based on the bio-molecular\bio-mechanical explanation of  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once inhaled, carbon monoxide passes from your lungs into your bloodstream, where it attaches to the hemoglobin molecules that normally carry oxygen. Oxygen can't travel on a hemoglobin molecule that already has carbon monoxide attached to it. As exposure continues, the gas hijacks more and more hemoglobin molecules, and the blood gradually loses its ability to carry enough oxygen to meet your body's needs. Without enough oxygen, individual cells suffocate and die, especially in vital organs such as the brain and heart.(1). </p>

<p>This correlates to oxygen being depleted and <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/biology/celres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">cellular respiration</a> not taking place to produce energy for the human body to optimally function; thus, another reason general fatigue and tiredness would occur. </p>

The MRI machine produces a powerful magnetic field which interacts with body tissues to produce radio waves, which are in turn interpreted by a computer to determine the location of the tissues.<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/MRI-scan/Pages/How-does-it-work.aspx""><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>This does not, however, mean MRIs are completely without risk. First and foremost, an MRI machine is basically a giant magnet. If one has metal in his or her body, from a medical implant, car accident, or even an improperly done tattoo, the MRI machine can move it, potentially violently. In the case of medical implants, an MRI machine can easily destroy any electrical components.<a href=""http://www.asnr.org/patientinfo/procedures/mri.shtml#block2""><sup>2</sup></a> There are a number of different reasons metal might be present in the body.<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/MRI-scan/Pages/Who-can-use-it.aspx""><sup>3</sup></a> This is why MRI technologists are trained to ask, repeatedly, about any metal that may be present.</p>

<p>In addition to metal, some MRIs involve contrast media, chemicals injected or consumed that increase visibility of certain tissues in MRI scans. These chemicals are normally removed by the body rather quickly, and except in individuals with reduced kidney function, are for the most part safe. However, there have been cases of allergic reactions and side effects.<a href=""http://www.insideradiology.com.au/pages/view.php?T_id=38#.VRsOKzvF_pb""><sup>4</sup></a> Also, recently, questionable studies have presented possible links between gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, though it was later shown that this link is only significant in patients with kidney failure.<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm142889.htm""><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h3>In Short</h3>

<p>In healthy individuals, with properly-functioning kidneys, no medical implants, no improperly-done tattoos, and no metal embedded in the body, MRIs are completely safe, once or even quite often.</p>

<p>In that picture it mentions how triangle wounds are impossible to stitch up. If that is true how would one treat a triangle puncture wound on the human body?</p>
","<p>Haha, the quote was a bit morbid, but it's funny! :)</p>

<p>I don't know why it's said that triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to close. What era was this written? As far as I know, today, we can practically stitch up all shapes of wounds as long as the skin edges are opposable. So whether it's a straight incised wound, a round puncture wound, a triangular wound, stellate wound, or a wound with jagged edges, it is <em>theoretically</em> possible to stitch them up. Sometimes, if the wound edges are jagged or serrated and won't oppose neatly, the surgeons can just trim off the edges to make them straight and allow for better opposition. If the edges are stellate, or maybe triangular, a purse string suture can be done, much like this picture: (I guess this is what you're looking for).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Laetg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Laetg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The skin of the human body is a bit loose and usually allows for some stretching. So sometimes, even if there's a considerable gap between the skin, it's still possible to close them up. The skin can be undermined (or released from the underlying tissues) so that it can be stretched further towards the center of the gap. </p>

<p>And even if the gap is too big that the available skin won't allow for it to be closed, it's still possible to close them in time. There are many ways to do this. For example, you can just cover it first with artifical skin and wait for the patient's skin to grow on its own towards the center; or you can close it with a transplanted skin from another site of the body; and so on...</p>

<p>So the plausibility of closure is not really a miracle in the scenario of a triangular wound. What I'm curious about this quote is the mention of bleeding because of the bayonet wound. I did some Google search because I was curious as to how a triangular-shaped wound would cause more bleeding compared to a regular stab wound. This is what I found:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had the unique privilege of meeting and interviewing a man who had actually been stabbed with one, straight through the arm. He was a reenactor who had been stuck when a fellow reenactor tripped and thrust his bayonet through the poor fellow's bicep. The scar was unmistakable. The bleeding had been profuse, but not preposterously so.
  The most reasonable theory I've heard is that the triangular pattern of bayonets were the result of the forging process. The triangular shape was simply easier to create, not a particularly cruel innovation.</p>
  
  <p>According to The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Warfare, ""bayonets with long triangular cross-sections were stronger in the charge and thrust than single or double bladed weapons"" (Page 414). The ""Bayonet History"" page of Armoury Online agrees that ""the most serious wounds can be inflicted with a thrusting stroke using a slim, rigid blade - a form which is embodied by the triangular and cruciform bladed socket bayonet.""</p>
  
  <p>These sources agree that it is not the triangular shape in itself causing profuse bleeding, rather it is the thrust of a strong bayonet in itself that does the damage. The triangular shape is therefore a result of manufacturing for strength, not necessarily to create the unique shape of the wound it would cause. - LordKettering</p>

<p>Fever or increased body temperature is almost solely caused by to the production <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever#Pathophysiology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)</a>. PGE2 acts on the hypothalamus or the thermoregulator of the body and as a result body temperature increases (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever#Pathophysiology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>). PGE2 production is controlled by the immune system. Fever is meant to have a good cause since fever is supposed to help killing the bacteria or viruses causing any illness.</p>

<p>Antipyretics are drugs which interact with PGE2. Basically they suppress the formation of PGE2. In that way they ""treat"" the fever.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the control circuit describing the thermoregulation PGEs has nothing to with this process. Due to this, blocking non existing PGE2 production during normal body temperature has no effect whatsoever which would cause the body temperature to drop.

"Is lemon juice bad for heart failure?","2303","","<p>Drinking a lot of grapefruit juice is not recommended for patients with heart failure. Does the same apply to lemon juice? and whatever the answer, why?</p>

<p>My source for the assertion about grapefruit juice is <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2474.aspx?CategoryID=73"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>
","<p>The study you link explains that the problem with grapefruit juice is its tendency to cause inhibition of the CYP3A4 liver enzyme, which is needed for the metabolism of many medications - including some statins prescribed to lower cholesterol. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikipedia</a> article on grapefruit explains this further, in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mechanism of grapefruit–drug interaction</p>
  
  <p>Grapefruit juice contains furanocoumarins. Furanocoumarins
  irreversibly inhibit a cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzyme called
  CYP3A4, as stated above. CYP3A4 is a metabolizing enzyme for almost
  50% of drugs, and is found in the liver and small intestinal
  epithelial cells. As a result, many drugs are impacted by
  consumption of grapefruit juice. When the metabolizing enzyme is
  inhibited, less of the drug will be metabolized by it in the
  epithelial cells. A decrease in drug metabolism means more of the
  original form of the drug could pass unchanged to systemic blood
  circulation. An unexpected high dose of the drug in the blood
  could lead to fatal drug toxicity.</p>
  
  <p>The furanocoumarins found in grapefruit juice are natural chemicals.
  Thus, they are present in all forms of the fruit, including freshly
  squeezed juice, frozen concentrate, and whole fruit. All these forms
  of the grapefruit juice have the potential to limit the metabolizing
  activity of CYP3A4. One whole grapefruit, or a glass of 200 mL (6.8 US
  fl oz) of grapefruit juice can cause drug overdose toxicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to explain that these furanocoumarins are unique to grapefruit, and I have not heard of any other fruit being associated with grapefruit in drug interaction warnings. However, since grapefruit is a cross of pumelo and a bitter orange, and since pumelo tastes like a big grapefruit, I would be cautious of pumelo.</p>

<p>However, I found no evidence that other common citrus contains furanocoumarins and would cause any adverse effects on drug metabolism. Furthermore, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.4960110902/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">this study</a> found that grapefruit itself lowers cholesterol and recommended it for reducing the risk of heart disease.</p>

"How does getting up and moving help me recover from surgery?","2289","","<p>I've just had a laparoscopic gallbladder removal, done as day surgery. I was released about 3 hours after the surgery started. The sheet of paper they sent me home with stresses the importance of getting up and moving. Resume your normal routine within the limits of your discomfort, they urge me. </p>

<p>About a year ago a relative had a laparoscopic appendix removal and spent a few days in the hospital. Again getting up and moving was considered vital. I accompanied him on many shuffling laps of the floor, iv pole and all.</p>

<p>Why does this help? What is going on physiologically when you walk around (even though it hurts like hell and you break into a cold sweat) rather than rest? Is there some body process being tapped into? What happens to people who don't move around? </p>
","<p>This is a broad question, but here are just a few major things to take into consideration after a surgical procedure. Early mobility has been shown for many years to be a major predictor of postoperative outcome, even in something like a hip fracture, where you would think rest was mandatory. The rapidity with which one returns to preoperative levels of independence in activities of daily living decreases postoperative morbidity and optimizes psychological well-being.</p>

<p>Complications of ""resting"" </p>

<p>Postoperative pulmonary complications, specifically atelectasis and pneumonia, are the leading cause of postoperative morbidity and death. Confinement to bed is a very serious risk factor for atelectasis and pneumonia. After surgery - especially upper abdominal surgery - sufficiently deep breathing needed to prevent some degree of pulmonary compromise is painful. If you're up and moving, you will (voluntarily and involuntarily) be taking more and deeper breaths than you will at rest (characterized by shallower respirations), especially if you're on pain medications.</p>

<p>Venous stasis and thromboembolism commonly occur postoperatively in patients who remain immobile. This is largely preventable with simple ambulation. It hurts to walk around after surgery, to be sure, but it's a lot better than suffering from a largely preventable pulmonary embolism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All efforts should be made to enforce postoperative movement, which is possible with adequate pain relief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Loss of strength</p>

<p>Bedrest results in loss of muscle mass and progressively more weakness. While it's not as great a consideration in younger adults as older adults, it is still considerable and, again, is largely preventable. Moving improves strength recovery, appetite, decreases stress, and overall increases feelings of well-being.</p>

<p>Pain Medications</p>

<p>Opioid medications usually given perioperatively can slow your bowels to almost a stand still (it's called <em>ileus</em>) and can result in painful gas buildup and constipation. Moving, and to a lesser extent dietary changes, encourage the bowels to be less sluggish, as does a switch to non-opioid pain medications.</p>

<p>Why ""rest""? </p>

<p>Most people think healing is impaired by early movement after surgery. While this is true of some surgeries, it is far from true for all of them. When the risk of resting outweighs the benefits, the goal is to get patients moving.</p>

According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, the quercetin in onions also reduces allergic reactions by stopping your body from producing histamines, which are what make you sneeze, cry and itch if you're having an allergic reaction.</p>

<p><strong>3.Cancer</strong></p>

<p>Quercetin may be a powerful anti-cancer agent, according to Jarzabkowski. The University of Maryland Medical Center said that quercetin may especially inhibit cancer cells in ""breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, endometrial, and lung tumors."" </p>

<p><strong>4.Digestion</strong></p>

<p>The fiber in onions promotes good digestion and helps keep you regular. Additionally, onions contain a special type of soluble fiber called oligofructose, which helps prevent and treat types of diarrhea. The phytochemicals in onions that scavenge free radicals may also reduce your risk of developing gastric ulcers, according to the National Onion Association.</p>

<p><strong>5.Regulating blood sugar</strong></p>

<p>The chromium in onions assists in regulating blood sugar. The sulfur in onions helps lower blood sugar by triggering increased insulin production.</p>

","<p>There is a study <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243011/"">described at nih.gov</a> about the rate of absorption of caffeine through the skin and how hair follicles contribute to it (""significantly"", is apparently the answer to that).

<p>The first-referenced article above has this summary about what was known at the beginning of the study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently, it has been shown that the hair follicles are responsible
  for a fast delivery of topically applied substances. After topical
  application, caffeine was already detected in the blood of the

  selectively blocked utilizing the newly developed Follicular Closing
  Technique (FCT), caffeine was detectable only after 20 min</p>

<p>How do topical steroid withdrawal relate to adrenal insufficiency?</p>
","<p>Good question! The missing bit of information here is that topical steroids are usually not absorbed systemically at high enough levels to cause adrenal suppression. However, they sometimes are. I shall explain.</p>

<p>First of all, regarding the relationship between <em>systemic</em> corticosteroid administration and adrenal insufficiency, please see <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1203/165"">this answer</a>. The basic idea (which I think you understand) is that exogenous administration of medications that mimic cortisol (a hormone produced in the adrenal gland) suppress the body’s processes for stimulating the hormone naturally. The adrenal gland atrophies due to the lack of natural stimulation. This causes a problem if the medication is suddenly withdrawn, because the body can’t quickly recover the ability to produce cortisol itself. This is called <strong>adrenal insufficiency</strong> or <strong>HPA axis suppression</strong>.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>Now to your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do topical steroid withdrawal relate to adrenal insufficiency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is that <em>if</em> topical steroids are absorbed into the bloodstream at high enough levels for a long enough time to suppress the HPA axis, they will cause adrenal insufficiency. Usually this degree of absorption occurs only with the use of “Group I” topical steroids, the strongest ones. <a href=""http://www.the-dermatologist.com/files/docs/DrugGuide1006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This list</a> shows the different categories of topical steroids by potency. The “super-potent” Group I includes:<sup>2</sup>   </p>

<ul>
<li>Betamethasone 0.05% </li>
<li>Clobetasol 0.05%</li>
<li>Diflurasone 0.05%</li>
<li>Halobetasol 0.05%</li>
<li>Flucinonide 0.1%</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important factors that determine whether or not HPA suppression will occur are the potency of the drug, the dose, and the duration of use. The Group I agents can cause significant HPA suppression if used for two or more weeks at a dose of ~2g/day. Other factors that predispose to HPA suppression include:</p>

<ul>
<li>application to permeable areas (face, mucous membranes)</li>
<li>occlusive dresssings</li>
<li>compromised skin integrity</li>
<li>young age</li>
</ul>

<p>The first list in your question appears to mostly outline <em>local</em> effects of withdrawing topical steroids. These are possible with less potent steroids and do not require systemic absorption. The second list, on the other hand, describes a syndrome of adrenal insufficiency. These are likely only the circumstances described above. </p>

"Does menthol have therapeutic effect on sore or inflamed muscles and tendons?","2062","","<p>I use a gel for muscle pain after sport. Its active ingredients are listed as ibuprofen and levomenthol. The amount of menthol is sufficient to feel quite a lot of numbbness/burning for maybe half an hour after application. </p>

<p>The ibuprofen is clear. But I was wondering about the menthol. Does it have any direct physiological effect on the sore muscles and tendons? Is there evidence that it has synergies with the ibuprofen or that it is helpful for the same complaints? Is there a medical indication for having this combination instead of making a gel with ibuprofen only? </p>
","<p>There is evidence of analgesic effects of menthol in scientific literature. It has been studied in humans and has shown to be <strong>superior to ice in delayed onset muscle soreness</strong>; in a placebo-controlled, triple-blind, cross-over clinical study <strong>menthol-based gel acutely reduced pain in subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. In mice blockage of voltage gated Na-channels</strong> of dorsal root ganglion neurons has shed light on potential mechanisms of analgesic action.</p>

<p>Here are the key parts of these studies:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362986/"">A comparison of topical menthol to ice on pain, evoked tetanic and voluntary force during delayed onset muscle soreness</a> has shown that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compared to ice, the topical menthol-based analgesic decreased perceived discomfort to a greater extent and permitted greater tetanic forces to be produced. [...] Tetanic force changes illustrated a significant main effect for the treatments (p&lt;0.05; ES=1.1) with the menthol based topical analgesic allowing 116.9% greater tetanic force (89.4 N ± 60.7) output than the ice treatment (41.2 ± 43.6). [...]  There was a significant (p=0.025; ES=1.2) difference in soreness perception with the VAS scale between the application of ice and the menthol based topical analgesic. Soreness perception was 63.1% less with application of the topical analgesic (1.1 ± 0.4) compared to the ice (3.1 ± 1.7).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this study menthol was applied as 3.5% gel (Biofreeze®) without substantial force or rubbing during application.</p>

<p>Aside from cooling sensation attributed to activation of TRPM8 channel in this and other studies, another study (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395911006907"">Menthol pain relief through cumulative inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels</a>) has tested the hypothesis that menthol could block voltage gated Na-channels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results indicate that menthol inhibits Na+ channels in a concentration-, voltage-, and frequency-dependent manner. Menthol promoted fast and slow inactivation states, causing use-dependent depression of Na+ channel activity. In current clamp recordings, menthol inhibited firing at high-frequency stimulation with minimal effects on normal neuronal activity. We found that low concentrations of menthol cause analgesia in mice, relieving pain produced by a Na+ channel-targeting toxin. We conclude that menthol is a state-selective blocker of Nav1.8, Nav1.9, and TTX-sensitive Na+ channels, indicating a role for Na+ channel blockade in the efficacy of menthol as topical analgesic compound.</p>

<p>Since my grandmother continues to develop cavities, she  twice daily brushes, flosses, then flosses again with interdental brushes, and concludes with a   Crest mouthwash with 0 alcohol (see the footnote). She also abstains from any added sugar or sweeteners. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> How does saltwater compare with non-alcoholic mouthwash for daily lifelong use?

","<p>Comparing ""saltwater"" to non-alcoholic mouthwash may be too general.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, pH is dependent on OH- (hydroxide) and H+ (Hydrogen) levels. Depending on the type of salt, let's say NaCl (table salt), water will recombine with the salt, but OH and H levels aren't affected. Na binds to OH and H binds to CL in equal quantity.</p>

<p>Regarding the following that I found below, I believe ""alkalinize"" can't be taken to mean below neutral. I think it means that it lowers the pH level, whether to basic or less acidic. How I think of it is that you start with a highly acidic environment due to the bacteria. Then you use something with less acidity to average out the pH. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Salt water rinses are good because they alkalinize the mouth (opposite of acidify, which is what the bacteria create.) Use one-half teaspoon each of baking soda and salt in a cup of warm water. The alkalinity helps decrease the bacteria count because they like an acid environment. As far as hot or cold, I'm not sure it matters. The rise in pH (alkalinity) is temporary.

"Eating chewing gum after lunch everyday","1987","","<p>I eat Doublemint chewing gum everyday after lunch. I eat it just to avoid drowsiness after lunch. I started this from the last week. </p>

<p>I have some questions,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does chewing gum help in digesting food ?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any side effects of chewing gum, in the long run ?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any other alternatives to chewing gum just to avoid drowsiness after lunch ?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>1.</strong> Very very slightly - you produce more saliva which you swallow (more on this in 2), but I'm not sure if that really contributes on a meaningful scale.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> I'm only talking about the important and/or long-term effects:</p>

<p>-Vastly better dental health (depending on what your gum contains, xylitol and polytol are good components to have)</p>

<p>-Chewing gum might exacerbate a problem for a person with some sort of Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD, TMJ)</p>

<p>-I assume the gum you're talking about is Wrigley's Doublemint - like many gums, it contains Aspartame, which is a controversial artificial sweetener. Many industry funded studies show this substance is safe, but over 90% independent studies show adverse health effects. There are some other sweeteners too, but for the most part they don't have adverse effects, especially in chewing gum doses. Some gums just use plain sugar.</p>

<p>-Along with the production of saliva, having something in your mouth triggers the cephalic phase - gastric, pancreatic and biliary fluids being released in your body in preparation for digestion. There's a minority of people claiming this can upset their stomach (changing the acidity), but I can't find any studies backing this statement up, and it seems like this happens to a very small amount of people anyway. <strong>If you eat the gum after lunch, I imagine this can only help with digestion though.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>
The reason we get drowsy after a lunch is because the body draws blood away from the brain to help the digestion process.</p>

<p>-Eating food that is easy / quick to digest will reduce this drowsiness. This also applies to amount of food eaten. In my personal experience eating light food (I buy chicken salad or an italian wrap!), and eating enough so you are just below the feeling of being 'full' helps tremendously. Try playing around with this and see if it works for you too.</p>

<p>-A 5 minute <em>very light</em> exercise session that will get your blood running. I use a local pull-up bar for a set or two when I have the time. This is just to 'warm up' and shouldn't be actual exercise.</p>

<p>-Splash cold water on your face for temporary mental sharpness.</p>

<p>-Stay hydrated, drink a lot of water. There are almost infinite reasons to stay as well hydrated as possible continuously. One of the first signs of dehydration is fatigue.</p>

"What's the best body position for measuring the blood pressure?","1975","","<p>Does the position of my arm and body matter?</p>

<p>If yes, then how? </p>

<p>What's the best body position for measuring the blood pressure?</p>
","<p>While trying to measure the blood pressure, the physician is most likely interested in measuring the pressure inside the left ventricle of the heart. So it is necessary that the Sphygmomanometer and the cuff should remain at the level of the heart. If it is above the level of heart, the reading is likely to be low, and if it is below the heart, the reading is likely to be high. Also, the blood pressure varies with the posture of the body in which the measurement is taken. So the blood pressure value that exists in most guidelines (for example JNC 8) is measured in the sitting position. Hence the value we are intenting to measure is the one with the patient is sitting position, back supported, legs uncrossed, and upper arm bared. The diastolic pressure is high in sitting position, and systolic pressure is high in supine position. Not supporting the back will increase diastolic pressure, while sitting cross legged increases systolic pressure. This is due to the inherent mechanisms in the human body to maintain perfusions to certain organs. The detailed biomechanics is beyond the scope of the present discussion though.</p>

"Why is Lamisil Once (terbinafine film-forming solution) marketed for athlete's foot, but not for jock itch or ringworm?","1940","","<p>Lamisil Once (terbinafine film-forming solution) is an over-the-counter antifungal medication. It's sold only in certain countries, such as Britain and Australia. You apply it once. It starts working right away. Then you wait a few weeks for it to finish working.</p>

<p>The maker, Novartis, advertises it as a treatment for athlete's foot. But the company <a href=""http://lamisil.com.au/product-oncefilm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">writes</a> that it ""is only recommended for the treatment of athlete's foot (tinea between the toes)"". For jock itch (tinea cruris) or ringworm (tinea corporis / tinea capitis / tinea manuum), Novartis recommends that you choose a different product (such as ordinary Lamisil cream) instead.</p>

<p>Why does Novartis recommend that sufferers of jock itch and ringworm choose a less-convenient product?</p>
","<p>After you apply Lamisil Once, it forms a medicated film. If you're careful, the film can remain on your skin for <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17559730"" rel=""nofollow"">up to 72 hours</a>. This will help to make sure that the optimal amount of medication will make its way into your skin.</p>

<p>On its website, Kiwi Drug elaborates: ""After 24 hours, showering may resume, but the application site ... should be gently patted dry, not rubbed, as doing so will remove the film. ... With these considerations in mind it's easy to see how Lamisil Once may not be the best choice for treatment in some areas, such as the groin or armpits, that tend to ... rub against skin or clothing.""</p>

<p>Based on all this, it seems to me that Lamisil Once might fail miserably if used for jock itch or ringworm. If you want to maximize your chances of success, it's probably wiser to choose a different product instead.</p>

"What is the tablet inside generic Omeprazole capsules","1939","","<p>Inside every generic delayed-release capsule of Omeprazole is what you would expect, hundreds of tiny granules, but there is <em>also</em> an entire tablet. An oblong, white, plain (no text) tablet. What is the tablet?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGmGq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGmGq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>I also tried to search for any formal information about the product's contents and composition, but couldn't find anything, probably because it is a generic product sold at a supermarket.
At any rate, this kind of composition (capsule, pellets and tablet) seems to form the mechanism for the 'delayed release' of Omeprazole, as written on the package.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lPM2B.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lPM2B.jpg"" alt=""Omeprazole Magnesium package""></a></p>

<p>Omeprazole is a drug with a rather short half-life (0.5-1 hour according to <a href=""https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00338"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Drug Bank</a>). This means that without any intervention in its pharmacokinetics (absorption, elimination time), it will start working in reducing stomach acid rather quickly - Immediate-release Omeprazole should be taken shortly (about 30 minutes) before eating, in order to reduce stomach acid prior to or during eating.</p>

<p>Now, although Omeprazole's effect is in the stomach, it needs to be protected from the acidic content of the stomach, where it passes before it is absorbed into the blood. After passing the stomach, it is absorbed into the blood and then reaches the parietal cells of the stomach lining and exerts its effect.</p>

<p>In order to make Omeprazole more friendly to the patient, and remove the need to take it only half an hour before eating (thus imposing limitations on the patient and increasing the risk of improper use that might lead to heartburn), delayed-release formulations have been developed. Their main difference and advantage is that the patient does not have to take the capsule only before eating - once he takes the capsule, its contents are <strong>slowly</strong> released in the body (more slowly than the immediate release formulation), thus providing a delayed effect throughout the day. That is why delayed-release Omeprazole should only be taken once a day (usually in the morning).</p>

<p>The delayed release mechanism is comprised of the pellets and the tablet. The pellets, being smaller, start to disintegrate and release the active ingredient Omeprazole before the tablet (but only after passing through the stomach, since they are enteric-coated as mentioned before). Meanwhile the tablet starts to dissolve, disintegrate and release the active ingredient, but this happens more slowly. After many calculations, it was possible to formulate the capsule and its contents in such a way that one capsule covers an entire day (24 hours). This enables the patient to take one capsule in the morning and act as usual, without worrying about getting heartburn after eating.</p>

<p>As I said in the beginning, I was unable to find formal documentation for this mechanism of delayed release, but the <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Omeprazole-Magnesium-Capsules-20.6mg-42ct/14706053"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consumers' questions</a> in Walmart's website seem to point in that direction (see page 7; please note that these answers are most probably not provided by professionals, but by customers and others).

<p>And here is the description of the figure (extracts):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most neurons in the vertebrate nervous system have several main
  features in common. The cell body contains the nucleus, the storehouse
  of genetic information, and gives rise to two types of cell processes:
  axons and dendrites. Axons are the transmitting element of neurons;
  they vary greatly in length, some extending more than 2 m within the
  body (...) <strong>The action potential, the cell’s conducting signal, is
  initiated at the initial segment of the axon and propagates to the
  synapse, the site at which signals flow from one neuron to another</strong>.
  Branches of the axon of the presynaptic neuron transmit signals to the
  postsynaptic cell. The branches of a single axon may form synapses
  with as many as 1,000 postsynaptic neurons. <strong>The apical and basal
  dendrites together with the cell body are the input elements of the
  neuron, receiving signals from other neurons</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So axons connect with target neuronal cells, either on the dendrites or the soma, to propagate the action potential.</p>

<p>What is the lowest temperature that is safe to drink for everyday consumption? Of course I don't want to drink freezing cold water.</p>
","<p><strong>1.</strong> Freezing cold (4 °C) beverages do not increase the secretion of the gastric acid more than lukewarm or hot beverages, according to this study:</p>

<p><em>McArthur KE et al, Gastric acid secretion, gastrin release, and gastric emptying in humans as affected by liquid meal temperature (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2912011"" rel=""nofollow"">PubMed</a>).</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coffee (360 mL) was infused into the stomach through a nasogastric
  tube at 58 (steaming hot), 37, or 4 degrees C (ice cold). Intragastric
  temperature, measured by an intragastric temperature sensor attached
  to the nasogastric tube, returned to body temperature 16.7 +/- 2.7 min
  after the hot meal and 23.8 +/- 1.1 min after the cold meal. Gastric
  acid secretion increased after hot, warm, and cold coffee but <strong>the
  initial temperature of the meal had no effect on gastric acid
  secretion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Cold beverages slow down stomach emptying, that is passing of food from the stomach into the small intestine, according to this study:</p>

<p><em>Collares EF et al, 1981, Gastric emptying in children. I. Influence of the temperature of a hydration solution for oral use (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7340752"" rel=""nofollow"">PubMed</a>)</em> </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that drinking cool water after the meals can slow down the digestion a bit and possibly cause an uncomfortable feeling of prolonged stomach fullness. This could be what the OP's parents referred to as ""blockage.""</p>

<p>As mentioned in the first study above, freezing cold (4 °C) coffee changes to the body temperature in about 20 minutes after it reaches the stomach, so it should not ""freeze"" the fats in the same sense as it can on the plate.</p>

<p>In conclusion, from the limited evidence presented above, it seems that cool water drunk with meals might cause some stomach discomfort after the meals. Someone would need to be quite observant to become aware of such feelings.</p>

"Do the broken mercury thermometer causes any health problem or poisoning?","1847","","<p>While using a mercury thermometer if it breaks and the mercury content in it is accidentally swallowed will it cause poisoning? and will it cause any long term effects or side effects on the body of the person swallowed it? </p>
","<p>The mercury found in a thermometer is <strong>elemental mercury</strong>. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, the greatest problem with it is that, apart from ingestion, there can be another route of exposure without noticing. <strong>Elemental mercury easily evaporates on room temperature, and these vapours can be inhaled.</strong> In this form Hg is liposoluble and is readily absorbed and passes the blood-brain barrier easily. Since main toxic effects of any form of mercury are neuro-toxic ones, this is a major concern. </p>

<p>There is more information about toxicity of various forms of mercury in <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1175560-overview#aw2aab6b2b4aa"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Medscape article</a>.</p>

<p>So, yes: exposure to elemental mercury such as the one from a broken thermometer can cause poisoning. It can affect the nervous system, lungs, kidneys...

"Does BMR adjust and decrease in response to calorie restriction diets?","1816","","<p>Is it possible for your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to adjust in response to dieting for long periods of time? If this does happen how much can it go down? I have heard that BMR ranges from 1000 - 2500 calories. Assume that multivitamins and other nutritional supplements (calcium, magnesium, minerals) are taken.</p>
","<p>Yes it can.  As a general statement, I'm not sure how much it can go down before it's a problem, which is what I think you are asking as your second question.  Starving to death might be seen as this taking the BMR close to zero (though I don't think you would get to zero before death).</p>

<p>I think a good reference for this is Peter Emery's review article ""<a href=""http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v19/n10/full/6701959a.html#bib14"" rel=""nofollow"">Metabolic changes in malnutrition</a>.""  There may be more appropriate references when concerning elective reductions in caloric intake, but I suspect the results are <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1885261"" rel=""nofollow"">similar</a> on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>There are a few sections of the review that are worth quoting and discussing here:</p>

<p>First the general trend and cause:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basal metabolic rate actually increases during the first few days
  of starvation, under the influence of catecholamines that are secreted
  in response to decreasing blood glucose concentrations. This
  probably reflects the high rate of gluconeogenesis that occurs at this
  time. As fasting progresses, however, metabolic rate decreases as free
  T3 and catecholamine levels decrease and the rate of gluconeogenesis
  decreases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, when you first start to fast (the references<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2405717?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"" rel=""nofollow""> [1</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837292?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"" rel=""nofollow"">2] </a>that the review sites are from 1-4 days in this section) the body looks to other sources of energy (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis"" rel=""nofollow"">gluconeogenesis</a>).  That is not sustainable over time, and then the BMR begins to drop.  How it begins to drop is largely through the lost of lean tissue, with a focus on muscle mass, which is probably a good evolutionary choice over more important systems such as the brain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The response to a less severe degree of food restriction can also be
  seen as a series of adaptive processes with the same priorities, that
  is to maintain the supply of glucose to the brain and to minimise the
  loss of lean tissue. Basal metabolic rate decreases to minimise the
  negative energy balance. This is achieved partly by loss of
  metabolically active tissue, but there is also some evidence that the
  efficiency of energy metabolism increases leading to a decrease in
  energy expenditure per unit cell mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10365978?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"" rel=""nofollow"">referenced review article</a> is also worth a read, especially as it deals with otherwise healthy individuals and people ""dieting"" in the common sense of the word (but in no means the medical).  Again body composition and physical activity take a leading role here, but changes in efficiency are certainly noted if not understood.  A conclusion reached on efficiency calculation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10365978?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"" rel=""nofollow"">ibid</a>) is also worth quoting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would thus appear that the generally used indicator of metabolic
  efficiency in humans, that is a reduced oxygen consumption per unit
  fat free mass, is fraught with problems since it does not account for
  variations in contributions from sub-compartments of the fat free mass
  which include those with high metabolism at rest such as brain and
  viscera and those with low metabolism at rest such as muscle mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in your life span you start on your low caloric diet can effect the outcome of the diet.  A commonly understood example is a shorter stature/smaller skeletal frame will develop under limited nutritional intake.  It's probably worth noting that on an evolutionary scale, having too many calories is an exceedingly new problem.  In other words, even if we wouldn't see it as preferential in the developed world today, it is probably an adaptive response to lose lean body mass or not develop additional skeletal structure (with goals of efficiency).  </p>

<p>I will end returning <a href=""http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v19/n10/full/6701959a.html#bib14"" rel=""nofollow"">Dr. Emery's</a> coverage of the same topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main response in chronically malnourished populations is slow
  growth rate, delayed maturity, and small adult stature. Small stature
  can be seen as a successful adaptation to low-energy intake because
  overall basal metabolic rate will be low. However, when metabolic rate
  is adjusted for fat-free mass there is no significant difference
  between those who are most malnourished and those who are well
  nourished. The reason for this is that the main deficit in lean
  tissue mass is in muscle, which has a relatively low metabolic rate,
  while the size of the visceral organs, which are much more
  metabolically active, is much less affected. Hence these changes in
  body composition may cancel out any increase in the efficiency of
  cellular metabolism.</p>

<p>Three possible mechanisms for the tolerance to diphenhydramine were suggested in the literature: behavioural adaptation (only if diphenhydramine was taken during the day for allergic rhinitis); (2) altered drug metabolism, e.g., increased clearance; or (3) altered neuropharmacological effect.</p>

"How can I obtain ""activated oxygen bleach""? I hear that it can help people to disinfect their laundry.​","1792","","<h3>Background</h3>

<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12077/how-can-you-disinfect-your-laundry/12078#12078"">Another thread</a> discusses how to disinfect laundry. This may be useful if someone in the home has a fungal infection (e.g. athlete's foot) or if it's full of feces or vomit or blood.</p>

<p>An answer there includes a list of about half a dozen recommendations. One of these recommendations is: ""Whenever you do laundry, use activated oxygen bleach.""</p>

<h3>Activated oxygen bleach</h3>

<p>An activated oxygen bleach (AOB) is any product which contains both <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach#Peroxide-based_bleaches"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oxygen bleach</a> and an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_activator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activator</a>. These ingredients may be included as part of a laundry detergent, or they may be part of a standalone ""color-safe bleach"" product.</p>

<p>I spent quite a while searching online to try to find a product which contains an activator; but, at first, I didn't find one.</p>

<h3>Common bleach activators</h3>

<p>Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_activator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says</a> that the most common activator used in Europe is tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED).</p>

<p>It adds that the most common activator used in the US is sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS).</p>

<h3>My question</h3>

<p>What's a commonly-available laundry product (a detergent or an oxygen bleach) which is <strong>labeled</strong> as containing some specific bleach activator?</p>

<p>""Labeled"" means one of two things:</p>

<p>A) The box or webpage includes an ingredients list, and one of the ingredients is a known bleach activator.</p>

<p>B) Or the box or webpage mentions the chemical name of the actual activator which is used in the product.</p>
","<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>OxiClean powder doesn't contain activated oxygen bleach (AOB), so don't buy it.</p>

<p>Here are a few popular products which include activated oxygen bleach:</p>

<p>In the US, you can use Tide Mountain Spring powder, or probably any other Tide powder. No pre-soaking is necessary. Do not use Tide liquid or Tide gel packs.</p>

<p>In the UK, you can use Persil Biological powder or Fairy Non-Bio powder. You must set your machine to 40&nbsp;°C or higher. Do not use liquid detergents or gel packs.</p>

<p>Details follow.</p>

<h1>I think you must buy powder</h1>

<p>You can buy a powder, a tablet, or a self-dissolving film-coated pack which contains a solid portion. But you can't buy a liquid detergent.</p>

<p><a href=""http://laundry.reviewed.com/features/liquid-powder-pacs-pods-which-detergent-cleans-clothes-best"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This source</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Powders have more bleaching technology than liquids, and can go after particulate soils better,"" says Elaine Cella, principal researcher for Tide. ""In powder we can put in non-chlorine bleach, which you can’t put into a liquid, because it deteriorates too quickly.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(But, the source seems to imply, liquid detergents are best at dealing with food, body oils, and other greasy soils.)</p>

<h1>In the US and Canada</h1>

<h3>NOBS</h3>

<p>NOBS is the best bleach activator commonly available in North America. But many laundry products don't use it. Perhaps this is because it's tricky to manufacture. <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/cen/topstory/8125/8125notw6.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a> It works fine in both warm and hot water.</p>

<p>I visited the <a href=""http://www.pgproductsafety.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">P&amp;G ingredients site</a>. It looks like many (maybe all) Tide powders include a bleach activator. For example: <a href=""http://www.pgproductsafety.com/productsafety/ingredients/Ultra_Tide_Powdered_Detergent_Mountain_Spring.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tide Mountain Spring powder</a> includes the activator NOBS. (The liquid <a href=""http://www.pgproductsafety.com/productsafety/ingredients/Tide_Mountain_Spring.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">does not</a>; don't use it.)</p>

<p>I checked the ingredients list for a few <a href=""https://www.pg.com/productsafety/search_results.php?submit=Search&amp;searchtext=Gain&amp;category=ingredients&amp;start=1&amp;num=50"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gain</a> powdered detergents. <a href=""https://www.pg.com/productsafety/ingredients/Ultra_Gain_OxyPowdered_Detergent_IcyFreshFizz.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ultra Gain with Oxy powder (Icy Fresh Fizz)</a> includes NOBS. All other Gain powders, including ""Ultra Gain"" and ""Ultra Gain with Febreze"", lack an activator; don't buy them.</p>

<h3>TAED</h3>

<p>TAED isn't as soluble than NOBS.</p>

<p>Everyone agrees that TAED works fine in hot water.</p>

<p>In warm water? <a href=""http://www.siriusint.com/our-products/britebleach-nobs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This source</a> says that TAED works at 40&nbsp;°C and above. In the worst-case scenario, if your cold-water supply can fall to 0&nbsp;°C, your washing machine's ""warm"" water setting can produce water as cold as 25&nbsp;°C. So I don't know whether or not TAED is always a good choice for warm-water clothes washing. <a href=""http://www.bradford.ac.uk/business/intellectual_property/tech_oppt/taed.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This source</a> gives me doubts about TAED's solubility. But, since the ""warm"" setting is <a href=""https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-and-water-temperature-1900646"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">usually significantly warmer than 25&nbsp;°C</a>, and since <a href=""http://futurefuelcorporation.com/nobs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this source</a> implies that it dissolves fully in 25 minutes even at 20&nbsp;°C, therefore it may be fine to use TAED in warm water if you do the following:</p>

<p>Start your top-loading washing machine's ""wash"" cycle and let it agitate for a few minutes, then pause the machine and let it soak for ten minutes before continuing.</p>

<p>Or, of course, you can just set your machine to 40&nbsp;°C. <a href=""https://www.persil.com/uk/laundry/laundry-tips/fabrics/top-tips-disinfect-clothes-ill.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a></p>

<h3>Do not buy</h3>

<p>OxiClean powder isn't a detergent; it's a color-safe bleach. I visited the <a href=""https://wercs.churchdwight.com/webviewer.external/private/search.aspx?language=EN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Church &amp; Dwight ingredients page</a>. I checked the <a href=""https://wercs.churchdwight.com/webviewer.external/private/document.aspx?prd=ING-1605%7E%7EPDF%7E%7EMTR%7E%7EING%7E%7EEN%7E%7E2010-01-15%2011%3A22%3A38%7E%7EOXICLEAN%20VERSATILE%20STAIN%20REMOVER%7E%7E&amp;productName=oxiclean&amp;productName_option=d__value~&amp;productID_option=d__value~&amp;language=d__EN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ingredients list</a> for regular OxiClean powder; it doesn't contain any activator.</p>

<p>I checked the ingredients table for Walmart's store-brand <a href=""http://cdn.corporate.walmart.com/46/83/454aab1d41c28de491d6d86b11b6/great-value-ingredient-list.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Great Value Oxi stain remover powder</a>. It doesn't include any activator either.</p>

<p>I checked an ingredients list for ""Ultra Purex Powder Detergent with Renuzit""; I found it on the Environmental Working Group website. It doesn't appear to contain any activator.</p>

<p>It looks like the US <a href=""https://sunproductsmsdsbrand.thewercs.com/private/results.aspx?__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR=D6323F43&amp;subformat=d__INDS&amp;language=d__EN&amp;CUSTOM3=powder%20laundry&amp;CUSTOM4=sunlight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun powders</a> don't contain any activators. I'm sure that the Canadian <a href=""https://sunproductsmsdsbrand.thewercs.com/private/results.aspx?__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR=D6323F43&amp;subformat=d__INDS&amp;language=d__EN&amp;CUSTOM3=powder%20laundry&amp;CUSTOM4=sunlight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sunlight powders</a> don't contain any: I checked all of them.</p>



<h1>In the UK</h1>

<p>I didn't do that much UK-related research, since I don't live in the UK. But I did check the <a href=""https://www.unilever.co.uk/wiop/products/persil/persil-biological-powder.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ingredients list for Persil Biological Powder</a>. It contains the activator TAED. <a href=""http://www.info-pg.com/eng/variants/United%20Kingdom?prodForm=487#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bold 2-in-1 washing powder granules</a> vary. For example, ""Lavender &amp; Camomile Advanced Performance"" includes TAED, but regular ""Lavender &amp; Camomile"" lacks it. All <a href=""http://www.info-pg.com/eng/variants/United%20Kingdom?prodForm=749#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fairy Non-Bio washing powder granules</a> include TAED, whether ""Advanced Performance"" or not.</p>

"Weight on front or back of feet","1777","","<p>When discussing correct posture for standing still, you often hear people talk about standing on both feet and not placing all your weight on either one of them. However, beside positioning your weight left-to-right, you can also position it front-to-back. I noticed I naturally place most (say 75%) of my weight on the front of my feet. What do experts say about this?</p>
","<p>So there are a few things making this a difficult question to answer.  Much of the in-depth research hasn't been done on healthy individuals (biomechanics of the foot), but where there's something wrong (pathomechanics of the foot).  There is also a difference between what is theoretically best (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3818677"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">found here</a>) and what people actually do (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173105/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sort of found here</a>).  Also, the search terms might not be readily apparent because the biomechanical word for ""standing"" is ""stance"" (eg ""load distribution in stance"").</p>

<p>The best models and papers I found were also behind pay walls (which my institution has access to), but I can summarize the information as follows:</p>

<p>There are 6 main points of pressure in the healthy foot: the heel, and the head of each (5) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metatarsals</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K7erA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K7erA.png"" alt=""Image of load points of the foot.""></a></p>

<p>The metatarsal head of the hallux (big toe, labeled 2 above) should take about 2x the pressure as the other 4 heads, which roughly balances the left to right load on the foot.</p>

<p>As far as front to back, the only reference I found that calculated an ideal position was the one I <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3818677"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mentioned before</a>, and seemed to indicate the heel should receive 52.6% +/- 1.36% of the load of the foot (Fig 7).  Presumably the rest of the weight would then be distributed to the metatarsal heads as mentioned above.</p>

<p>I will say that was calculated with math I don't quite understand, and on a very idealized adult foot.  It might be much more useful to ask the question: ""How do people with healthy feet and gates distribute the load on their feet?""</p>

<p>That would go back to my <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173105/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">second reference</a> and give us this lovely figure: [Fig 1]</p>

<p>My final conclusion is that if you are concerned about your gate you should see an OT or PT. Check for uneven wear on the feet, and try to stay ""balanced.""</p>

"Can I apply dettol & adhesive bandages on dog bites?","1776","","<p>I always have pet dogs in my house. Day in &amp; day out my dog bites me playfully; sometimes while cleaning his teeth, he closes his mouth suddenly to cut my finger. These happened for quite long since my first dog. </p>

<p>This was the bite one year back</p>

<p>Normally, I wash my hands with carbolic soaps &amp; then leave them.</p>

<p>Though they are vaccinised, I often take a booster of tetanus. But the doctor said it is not always necessary to take tetanus booster every time it bites or scratches. I don't know why he told so.</p>

<p>My main question is: Can I apply dettol or savlon in these cuts? Can I use band-aids on them?  </p>

<p>Also, is there any possible explanation of why the doctor told not to take booster all the time after all they are not hazardous drugs, are they?  </p>
","<p><strong>Tetanus Vaccine</strong>
If you get a tetanus shot every five years you are good to go. The recommended dose of tetanus toxoid (vaccine) is every ten years but since: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a small percentage of individuals, antitoxin levels fall below the minimal protective level before 10 years have elapsed, to ensure adequate protective antitoxin levels, persons who sustain a wound that is other than clean and minor should receive a tetanus booster if more than 5 years have elapsed since their last dose</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Taken from <a href=""http://cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html"">http://cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html</a> chapter on tetanus) </p>

<p>As for your <strong>wounds</strong>, it is better to wash them with simple soaps and water and leave them to heal without band-aids. The principle is: use solutions that do not cause further damage to the skin and that can be applied to clean most residues and dead tissue with mechanic force rather than chemical action. The most used in Hospital settings is saline solution (H2O plus NaCl at 0.9&amp;), we use it with a syringe so the water comes with pressure. </p>

<p>Here are the general recommendations for wound management/treatment: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Apply direct pressure to any bleeding wound, to control hemorrhage. Tourniquets are rarely indicated since they may reduce tissue
  viability.</li>
  <li>Examine wounds for gross contamination, devitalized tissue, and
  foreign bodies.</li>
  <li>Remove constricting rings or other jewelry from injured body part.</li>
  <li>Cleanse the wound periphery with soap and sterile water or available
  solutions, and provide anesthetics and analgesia whenever possible.</li>
  <li>Irrigate wounds with saline solution using a large bore needle and syringe. If unavailable, bottled water is acceptable.</li>
  <li>Leave contaminated wounds, bites, and punctures open. Wounds that are sutured in an unsterile environment, or are not cleansed,irrigated, and debrided appropriately, are at high risk for infection due to contamination. Wounds that are not closed primarily (sutured) because of high risk of infection should be considered for delayed primary closure by experienced medical staff using sterile technique.</li>
  <li>Remove devitalized tissue and foreign bodies prior to repair as they may increase the incidence of infection</li>
  <li>Clip hair close to the wound, if necessary. Shaving of hair is not
  necessary, and may increase the chance of wound infection.</li>
  <li>Cover wounds (other than contaminated wounds, bites, and punctures) with dry dressing; deeper wounds may require packing with saline  soaked gauze and subsequent coverage with a dry bulky dressing.</li>

"How fast is blood replaced in the body?","1747","","<p>I'm a writer, and I require some details for my writing. I've included the circumstances for my question below, in case they can help you answer the question. </p>

<p>In my current project, I'm dealing with a disease that slowly replaces the blood cells of the human body with its own infectious replicas. These cells serve the same purpose as red blood cells, with the distinct disadvantage that they keep the body infected. In all other aspects, they are essentially red blood cells. </p>

<p>In addition to this, the disease eventually works its way into the bone marrow, stopping it from manufacturing red blood cells altogether. Instead, the bone marrow is forced to create more of the replicas. </p>

<p>The only way to cure an infected person (that I can see) would be to somehow cure the bone marrow and get it to produce red blood cells again. It is my understanding that blood cells are constantly dying and being reproduced, so repairing the bone marrow would eventually result in the bloodstream being repopulated with red blood cells, and the replicas dying out. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> On that note, how long would it take the human body to completely replace its blood supply? Or is this even possible? </p>
","<p>Calculating from the numbers Wikipedia's articles on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"">bone marrow</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell#Human_erythrocytes"">red blood cells</a>, the bone marrow in an adult human produces between 200 billion and 500 billion red blood cells a day, taking between 60 and 120 days to produce enough to replace the 20-30 trillion red blood cells in circulation.  Under normal conditions, red blood cells wear out and are replaced on a 120-day cycle; presumably the faster production rate is for dealing with injuries or other abnormal loss of RBCs.</p>

"Can eating chalk cause very low level haemoglobin level?","1721","","<p>My friend has a haemoglobin level of 6 g/dl. She eats a lot of chalk. The doctor said that the chalk accumulation is hindering the production of haemoglobin. Does that make sense, or there might be a deeper cause for the severely low Hb levels? </p>

<p>In particular, is it okay to trust the doctor's opinion about her chalk intake affecting the production of Hb?</p>
","<p>Eating chalk is a type of Pica. It is characterized by an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive, such as paper, clay, drywall or paint, metal, chalk, soil, glass, or sand which is more common with women and children.</p>

<p>Low blood-hemoglobin levels, a sign of anemia, are common, because the <strong>ingestion of chalk inhibits absorption of iron</strong> from foods.Those who eat chalk at the expense of healthier foods often develop malnutrition.<a href=""http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/science-medicine/clay-eating"">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Due to inhibition of absorption of iron from food, it results in deficiency of iron in our body.Low blood iron levels limit our body's ability to produce hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, which might be possible cause of causing anemia.</p>

<p>I am talking about a common cold, not something extreme.</p>
","<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong> - More contagious at the beginning, much less at the end.</p>

<p>The ""common cold"" (or upper respiratory infection) is associated with over 200 different viral types<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold#Virology"">1</a></sup>, and many times more than one virus is present. Because of this, there's probably no <em>completely</em> specific answer to this question, but it can be answered generally.</p>

<p>Rhinovirus-caused colds (which are a large majority of ""common"" colds) are typically contagious at the beginning, and are much less contagious after a few days<sup><a href=""http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/6/1287"">2</a></sup>. You are most at risk of transmitting the virus to someone else for the 4-5 days after being <em>exposed</em> yourself<sup><a href=""http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/when-are-colds-contagious"">3</a></sup> - not necessarily when symptoms appear.</p>

<p>In other words, you can definitely be asymptomatic and still contagious. On the other hand, if you still feel symptoms after a week, the chances are much lower that you're actually still contagious.</p>

"How does removal of calculus/tartar above the gum line affect deposits below gum line?","1663","","<p>I have some dental calculus on the back of my mandibular incisors (bottom front teeth). Some of the calculus is beneath the gum line (I'm not sure how far), and the gums are starting to recede (very slightly). </p>

<p>I ordered a set of dental picks and I am going to remove the calculus that is above the gumline, and I am wondering if this will help break down the deposits that are below the gumline. What will be the long-term effects of me only removing the calculus above the gumline?</p>

<p>Also, is there any sort of mouthwash/rinse that I can use that will help break down thick deposits to make them easier to remove? </p>
","<p>I will answer to each element of your quesiton separatly:</p>

<p>Calculus (Tarter) is calcified bio-film and plaque that is stuck on the surfaces of your teeth. Inside are bacterias, dead or alive, along with their byproducts (and their toxins) that irritate the gums, which may eventually cause an immune response in the gums that will lead to a recession.</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>scaling (removing) the ""half"" that is above</strong> the gums will do <strong>little or nothing</strong> to improve your situation, especially if there is anything left behind, bellow the gums.</p>

<p><strong>The same can be said of any mouthrinces</strong> and other products you might try. They will hardly have any effect on the surfaces of the teeth above the gum line, due to the relatively short amount of time most people keep mouthrince in their mouth, the slow diffusion of the active ingredients across the calculus. It will not even reach below the gums wont remove/dissolve sub-gingival plaque or calculus. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if you chose to attempt to perform scaling deeper with picks, you risk <strong>damaging your gums</strong>, especially since the ""picks"" will be pointed towards your gums, and you will eventually slide them too far and therefore damage even more the soft tissues that surround and support your tooth, potentially accelerating the recession, or worsening the inflamation.</p>

<p>Dentists and hygienists use <strong>scalers and curettes</strong>, which cause minimal damage to the gums if used properly. Do not attempt to use them at home, on yourself, if you don't know what you are doing or lack good dexterity and technique. There are numerous videos on YouTube about how to use them.</p>

<p>Needless to say, if you have access to a hygienist, a dentist or periodontist (dentist that specializes in the treatment of gums) you will be in good hands.</p>

"Is rabies contagious?","1627","","<p>Is the rabies disease contagious, that is can it spread from one human to other by means of sharing food?  </p>

<p>If not, through what means does can spread, and  what are the measures and precautions that must be taken to avoid the spreading of the disease? </p>
","<p>Yes, rabies is most definitely contagious.</p>

<p>The most <em>common</em> route of infection is from the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">bite of an infected animal</a>, which introduces virus-laden saliva to the victim. It's also possible, though much less likely, to be exposed to infective saliva in the eyes, nose and mouth.</p>

<p>The CDC claims that a person-to-person transmission of the virus via bite is theoretically possible, but has not been documented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/exposure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">...bite and non-bite exposures inflicted by infected humans could theoretically transmit rabies, but no such cases have been documented</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has however been person-to-person transmission of the virus through <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5327.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">organ transplants</a>, also documented <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa043018"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of avoiding spreading the disease, the routes of transmission suggest several clear methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoiding contact with wild animals, or domestic animals in rabies endemic areas showing signs of infection, such as hydrophobia or aggressive behavior.</li>
<li>Vaccinating animal populations to interrupt transmission of the virus within wildlife.</li>

<li>the male does not ejaculate</li>
<li>the timing of sex was the day after normal bleeding stopped</li>

<p>Is there a way to calculate the likelihood of becoming pregnant from such an encounter? </p>
","<p>As long the condom don't break you are 99% safe of diseases and babies. Beware that even if the male doesn't ejaculate you can still get pregnant or get diseases if you do not use condoms.</p>

<p>Also you can get pregnant or a disease even if the first time, the second or whatever. Always do safe sex.</p>

<p>All pregnancy tests look for the presence of hCG. hCG is short for ""human chorionic gonadotropin"" a hormone produced during pregnancy.<a href=""http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/How_Soon_Can_I_Take_a_Pregnancy_Test"" rel=""nofollow"">[1]</a></p>

<p>To get accurate results, take a pregnancy test 12-14 days after ovulation and retest after you miss your period if you get a negative result.

<p>Your doctor may be able to perform a blood test that can pick up hCG in smaller amounts than a urine test. However, even blood tests cannot tell you whether or not you're pregnant until at least six to eight days after you ovulate, because hCG is not produced until implantation. The soonest you can take a pregnancy test, even if you go to your doctor, is seven days after you ovulate.<a href=""http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/How_Soon_Can_I_Take_a_Pregnancy_Test"" rel=""nofollow"">[1]</a></p>

","<p>Obviously some spicy foods are better for you than others, but I am assuming you want an answer about spicy foods in general. </p>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of eating spicy foods, especially chili peppers, is that it helps you lose weight. Spicy foods help to raise your metabolic rate, which will slow down your weight gain. If you eat spicy foods often, the effects add up.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>A 2007 study by Nottingham University<sup>2</sup> found that spicy foods can help kill cancer cells. Capsaicin, which is what makes many foods spicy, attacks the mitochondria of the cancer cells, triggering their death. </p>

<p>Spicy foods have also been found to help decongest your sinuses. A 1998 study<sup>3</sup> found that a capsaicin nasal spray helped to clear the sinuses of people. Eating spicy foods has been known to have a similar effect.<sup>4</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>Now for some risks of eating spicy food.</p>

<p>When you are eating spicy foods, there are only a few risks to watch out for. Spicy foods have been known as foods that can trigger heartburn, so anyone with heartburn should avoid them.<sup>5</sup> Some spicy foods that don't contain capsaicin, like horseradish, can sometimes damage tissue.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>There are usually more risks when handling spicy foods, especially peppers. If pepper juice gets in your eye, it will cause pain and possibly swelling. If this ever happens, there are ways to flush out your eyes.<sup>7</sup> Handling peppers and sometimes horseradish before eating can cause pain, swelling, redness, and irritation in your hand. To avoid this, wear gloves when cutting peppers and wash your hands thoroughly after (washing with milk will help).<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>Just state your complaint in plain language as clearly as you can using layman's terms. I doubt that a Japanese doctor needs much more guidance from you than simply understanding your complaint.

<p>I would expect the doctor to examine both ear canals. If your theory is correct, the doctor won't need further explanation. She will see it with her own eyes and know what to do about it.

"What causes optical floaters to be more or less visible?","1536","","<p>When I first started getting floaters in my eyes (several years ago), my opthalmologist told me that they don't go away but over time your brain learns to ignore them/filter them out.  This seems to be largely true in my case; what, at onset, was very invasive is now mostly not a problem.  But sometimes they become more prominent again, usually for a few minutes at a time.  Is this a difference in <em>perception</em> (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in <em>placement</em> (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)?  How do floaters ""work""?</p>

<p>If this is caused by the floaters moving into particularly inconvenient spots within the eye, is their movement affected by any external factors like posture?  This morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something, and I'd like to avoid a recurrence.  (It was a public reading and I couldn't move what I was reading from -- it had to be flat on the reading desk.)</p>

<p>In case it matters, my floaters were not caused by eye trauma or retina problems; I was told this is just part of the aging process.</p>

<p>I am not asking for a personal diagnosis.  This is a physiology question -- what's going on in the eye (or brain) when floaters are active?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>[S]ometimes they become more prominent again, usually for a few minutes at a time. Is this a difference in <em>perception</em> (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in <em>placement</em> (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Floaters do move, but not very much. Mostly they ""sway and settle"" when we shift our focus of vision. Noticing floaters is likely a difference in perception, for example moving your line of sight from one which is complex to one with a simple background, for (a completely made up) example, from looking at a large painting to looking at a ceiling. The lack of contrast will make the irregularities in vision caused by floaters to stand out/be noticeable for a few minutes, maybe even be bothersome and worrisome, but it soon stops. You can ""find"" floaters by doing that, especially if you look into a softly lit surface, like an x-ray view box without the x-rays. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do floaters ""work""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vitreous humor (the very structures gel-like collagen &amp; fluid substance in the eyeball behind the iris) starts to break down/liquify in spots as we age; this is a common and benign cause of age-related floaters. You can picture how floaters work by imagining crystal-clear jello that had set in a clear glass. If you took a hot knife and quickly swiped it through the jello, some of the jello would melt; you would see an aberration in the path of light through that spot; you wouldn't see perfectly through it. Turn the glass and the aberration would be different at different angles. That's approximately how floaters work. Some are minimal, some are more marked because of the plane of liquifaction/separation of collagen fibers. They do not ""move"", though, through the vitreous any more than that melted jello moves through the whole.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sudden onset of floaters disturbing your visual field are most likely not the more benign aging process of vitreous breakdown, and merit a trip (or at <em>least</em> a call) to the opthalmologist. Those kinds of floaters (sometimes associated with flashes) tend to be caused by vitreous detachment from the retina, and can lead to retinal detachments and/or hemorrhages. While often just isolated in nature, it can be a sign of more serious and vision-threatening retinal pathology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to avoid a recurrence.</p>

<p>I don't know of any way at all to predict or restrict recurrences unless there is retinal pathology being treated by an opthalmologist.</p>

<p>But does not cite any sources for that section at all. Neither does the article on aldosterone. </p>
","<p>I've found a supporting source for the fluid retention claim, in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13780/"" rel=""nofollow"">an excerpt from <em>Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine, 6th edition</em></a> (from 2003). This separates the effects on the kidney into two categories, depending in part on the drug: mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid.</p>

<p>Mineralocorticoid effects include</p>

<ul>
<li>Loss of potassium and hydrogen</li>
<li>Increase in extracellular fluid volume</li>
<li>Increase in sodium retention</li>
</ul>

<p>Glucocorticoid effects include</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase in plasma flow in the kidney</li>
<li>Increase in sodium retention</li>
</ul>

<p>Both types of effects can occur in limited frequencies outside the kidney, generally in the gastrointestinal system.</p>

<hr>

<p>These effects can then lead to a variety of symptoms, including high blood pressure. Mineralocorticoids can cause chronic arterial hypertension through long-term sodium retention. Glucocorticoids can do the same, through several factors (the details of which are unknown):</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase in filtration fraction, the ratio of glomerular filtration rate to renal plasma flow<sup><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=otvv8dXuzP0C&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=filtration+fraction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZwcKZtPzJAhWMNSYKHePHDs0Q6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=filtration%20fraction&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">[1]</a></sup></li>

</ul>

<p>Vasodilation refers to the size of the capillaries; dilation of the capillaries decreases blood pressure, while the reverse increases blood pressure. This is perhaps the most direct effect of corticosteroids on hypertension and blood pressure.</p>

"How does ones TSH tend to vary over the course of a day?","1523","","<p>A single TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) blood test is commonly used to help diagnose thyroid problems, however my understanding is that the TSH tends to vary substantially over the course of a day, based on time of day (eg TSH is highest at about 5am, from memory). </p>

<p>Is there data and/or a chart available that illustrates typical variation over the course of a day for people with a healthy thyroid? How about for people with thyroid problems?</p>
","<p>TSH has a quite important circadian rhythm. </p>

<p>Most of the original research on it is not freely accessible, as open access wasn't really a thing when these studies were done, in the 80s, but this one is freely available: <a href=""http://www.clinchem.org/content/42/1/135.abstract"">Physiological variations in thyroid hormones: physiological and pathophysiological considerations</a>. There is a section on circadian and seasonal rhythm and a table with some values. Quoting from the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a clear circadian variation in circulating TSH concentrations in animals and in humans. TSH concentrations are low during the daytime, increase in the evening, and peak shortly before sleep.  Amounts decline slowly during sleep. Table 3 summarizes studies of mean, nadir, and peak serum </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also mention that the nocturnal TSH secretion is weakened in people with hyperthyroidism. </p>

<p>A chart is available in figure 2 of the paper <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556407X07000331"">Modulation of Endocrine Function by Sleep-Wake Homeostasis and Circadian Rhythmicity</a></p>

<p><em>Hyperthyroidism</em></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2500558"">Significance of latent hyperthyroidism</a> is another study from the 80s on this. They found a significant circadian rhythm in normal (euthyroid) patients, but a suppressed rhythm in subjects with hyperthyroidism, the suppression getting stronger the worse the hyperthyroidism is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The circadian rhythm in latent hyperthyroidism is distinctly suppressed and in overt hyperthyroidism totally. Whereas in latent hyperthyroidism pulsatile secretion is extant, in overt hyperthyroidism the TSH pulses are absent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Hypothyroidism</em></p>

<p>The same is basically observed in hypothyroidism, see, for example <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11201856"">Diurnal thyrotropin secretion in short-term profound primary hypothyroidism: does it ever persist?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, diurnal rhythmicity in serum TSH levels was abolished in a uniform cohort of patients with short-term severe primary hypothyroidism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1286520"">Circadian changes in pulsatile TSH release in primary hypothyroidism</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nocturnal TSH surge was absent in six out of nine patients with overt primary hypothyroidism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The circadian rhythm is weaker, different, or even absent. </p>

<p>While I have always had doctors recommend having TSH done in the morning, without eating beforehand, <a href=""http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/heart/diagnostics-testing/laboratory-tests/thyroid-blood-tests"">this doesn't seem to be a general suggestion</a>. However, it's at least desirable to always have them <a href=""http://www.thyroiduk.org.uk/tuk/diagnosis/getting_diagnosis.html"">done at the same time of day, to make values comparable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TSH has a circadian rhythm (24 hour cycle) and levels peak between midnight and 6am.  T3 has a similar circadian rhythm. It is therefore a good idea to have your thyroid tests done at the same time of day each time as your levels may differ at different times of the day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Word explanation</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>primary hypothyroidism means that the hypothyroidism is caused by a thyroid disorder itself </li>
<li>secondary hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism caused by, for example a problem in the part of the brain controlling the thyroid) </li>
<li>an euthyroid patient has normal thyroid function </li>
<li>latent thyroid problems are those that are detected in lab tests, but don't show symptoms yet</li>
<li>subclinical is the reverse: showing symptoms, but blood tests have no significant results </li>

"When someone with glaucoma sees rainbows around lights, what exactly is happening physically?","1492","","<p>People with open-angle glaucoma sometimes see halos or rainbows around bright lights (e.g. headlights at night), but not always.  Glaucoma results in elevated intraocular pressure and thence pressure on the optic nerve, so it doesn't surprise me that there'd be visual effects -- but why <em>halos</em> and <em>rainbows</em> specifically and not, say, blurry vision or flashes of light or some other deviation from normal vision?  And what factors govern when it happens, since it's not a constant state?  Is that just caused by minor fluctuations in the pressure level, which I understand varies through the course of the day, or is there some other factor?</p>
","<p>The so-called halos are typical for spikes of intraocular pressure rise in high-tension glaucoma (or ocular hypertension) forms, most often in <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9071.2009.01920.x/full"" rel=""nofollow"">melanin-dispersion syndrome (MDS, or pigment-dispersion syndrome)</a> which is a trigger for glaucoma in myopes and often begins in early adulthood. </p>

<p>The halos appear when a spike in intraocular pressure leads to <a href=""http://www.eyecalcs.com/DWAN/pages/v4/v4c016a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">intracorneal edema</a>, as the corneal endothelial cells which permanently pump the nutritious water out of the cornea cannot compete with the high pressure pushing the fluid into the cornea anymore. Thus, the cornea fills with water, leading to temporary loss of visual acuity and, as an early symptom, to halos and rainbows around sources of light due to increased dispersion of light. The regularity of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for corneal transparency, is disturbed by the intrusion of water leading to cell displacement.</p>

<p>Basically, this can happen in other forms of high-tension glaucoma or ocular hypertension with momentarily raised intraocular pressure (IOP), too. Note that it only does in forms where the IOP rises quickly, whereas in a slow and constant rise (as it happens in many forms of chronic glaucoma) the endothelial cells can adapt and still drain the cornea from the excess water. So basically, the same happens in an attack of angle-closure glaucoma, just with the difference being that angle-closure glaucomas often don't go away without medical treatment, whereas in early adulthood IOP spikes due to MDS the halos often are the only symptom which is often triggered by exercise or in dim ambience light situations. This is due to the fact that when the iris moves (as in widened pupils due to adrenaline reactions when performing sports or whe the lights are dim) in a patient with MDS, it rubs against the lens, loses pigment by erosion and this then <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/8527032_Intraocular_pressure_spike_after_YAG_iridotomy_in_patients_with_pigment_dispersion"" rel=""nofollow"">clogs the eye's drain</a> (in the anterior chamber angle).</p>

<p>This can be seen as basic knowledge in ophthalmology. A first report on the mechanism leading to IOP rise dates <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002939453907995"" rel=""nofollow"">back to 1953</a>. The induction of IOP spikes by exercise has also <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002939480900732"" rel=""nofollow"">been known for a longer period of time</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT: As your question explicitly relates to open-angle glaucoma, I'd like to add that there are different types of open-angle glaucoma, and only some of them are known for IOP spikes that could lead to said halos and rainbows. Primary open-angle glaucoma usually doesn't, but other than the mentioned pigmentaray dispension syndrome, <a href=""https://books.google.de/books?id=JZ9Gs3fLqrcC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=pex+glaucoma+spikes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xeLL-Xtl0G&amp;sig=4bl_Gz93-chlsUZcwbQwbhoPFT0&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cfBZVfPHH8GNsgGkl4CACQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIs8SA6bnLxQIVwYYsCh2kCwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pex%20glaucoma%20spikes&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">PEX glaucoma</a> could, and <a href=""http://www.oic.it/~egsmadrid2010/pdf/ps3b/P3.148.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">herpes simplex trabeculitis</a> is also not uncommon.</p>

"Gamekeeper's thumb - long term healing","1490","","<p>I hurt the base of my right thumb about a year ago. The immediate area swelled up, so I saw a doctor soon after who diagnosed it as gamekeeper's thumb. I wore a splint for a two weeks and everything was great after taking it off.</p>

<p>However, I recently aggravated it again. It isn't painful most of the time, but sometimes clicks when flexing the entire range of motion (the same way as it did originally after the injury).</p>

<p>What's the best thing I can do now to re-heal (hopefully better) the injury?</p>
","<p>""Gamekeeper's thumb"" - named because of the <em>chronic</em> injury incurred when rabbit keepers broke rabbits' necks between the base of the thumb and index finger - has more recently been referred to as ""skier's thumb"", now the most common <em>acute</em> mechanism of the injury.  <em>If</em> you fell on an outstretched hand hyperextending your thumb (did it feel as if the thumb was stressed beyond its normal range of motion?) <em>and</em> your doctor was correct, you injured the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) of the thumb. This would cause significant pain and swelling at the base of the thumb in the ""web space"" between thumb and index finger.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHrj3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GEnMa.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see in the picture on the right, the UCL appears partially torn. If it does not heal completely, it can result in an insufficiency of that ligament. In this case, the condition not uncommonly becomes chronic because of repeated injury to the already weakened UCL. It causes varying degrees of instability of that joint with pain and weakness of the pincer grasp (imagine squeezing an m&amp;m between your thumb and your index finger.)</p>

<p>Initial treatment to optimize ligament healing is immobilization.</p>

<p>What can you do now? If you think you re-injured it, you can apply a cold pack (e.g. a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a dry washcloth) to the thumb as tolerated for ~20 minutes, up to four times per day. </p>

<p>Immobilizing the thumb with a bulky, loose ACE wrap or a commercially available thumb brace in the neutral position will help lessen the pain.
You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief if you have no contraindications*.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do is see a doctor (perhaps an orthopedist or a hand specialist would be wise), since chronic pain and instability of the thumb is not insignificant. They can do a thorough evaluation of your thumb
and either splint/cast your thumb, give you rehabilitative exercises to help you strengthen your thumb, or recommend surgery if necessary.</p>

<p>*<sub>Contraindication = any reason you shouldn't take it.</sub><br>
<sub>Always keep a cloth between your skin and the ice pack, and press firmly against all the curves of the affected area. Remove the ice pack if it causes pain, and don't fall asleep with the pack in place.</sub></p>

"Do the antimicrobial properties of honey counteract the probiotic properties of yogurt?","1483","","<p>The question is summed up in the title.</p>

<p>In the quest for impeccable gut flora, this concern popped up.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some additional information regarding the antibacterial properties of honey and the probiotic yogurt:</p>

<p>From a medical article regarding honey's medical applications (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/</a>):</p>

<p>""Currently, many researchers have reported the antibacterial activity of honey and found that natural unheated honey has some broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when tested against pathogenic bacteria, oral bacteria as well as food spoilage bacteria""</p>

<p>""The Leptospermum scoparium (L. scoparium) honey,the best known of the honeys, has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on around 60 species of bacteria...""</p>

<p>Yogurts can contain probiotic bacteria such as <em>Lactobacillus</em> and probiotic yeast <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em>. </p>

<p>That being said, I can't seem to find any resources online regarding any potential conflict between these two items. I do get a lot of yogurt + honey recipes though, so if there is any interest in that field, consider me an expert now.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Do the antimicrobial properties of honey counteract the probiotic properties of yogurt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears not to. Studies using 5% (w/w) clover honey had no effect on Steptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrukeii subsp bulgaricus and probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum.</p>

<p>You are correct that honey has been found to have antimicrobial properties against a wide range of pathogens. However, these studies are done for the scenario of using undiluted honey as a wound dressing. For example, from a recent study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For at least 2700 years, honey has been used by humans to treat a variety of ailments <em>through topical application</em>, but only recently have the antiseptic and antimicrobial properties of honey been discovered. ...Clinical studies have demonstrated that application of honey to severely infected cutaneous wounds rapidly clears infection from the wound and improves tissue healing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of honey are confirmed but the exact mechanism is unclear; it could be due to the acidity, honey's osmotic effect, presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal factors (hydrogen peroxide, antioxidants, lysozyme, polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, methylglyoxal, and bee peptides), etc. </p>

<p>From a review atricle,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bacterial level greater than 10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of wound tissue has been found to have a deleterious effect on wound healing in surgical and chronic wounds. [This article discusses] the inherent complexities of the clinical use of medical-grade honey... and to select clinical entities in patients who may benefit from treatment with medical-grade honey, using the evidence indicators such as the Cochrane reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studies have demonstrated that the antibacterial properties of honey are more complex than just high sugar content alone (which decreases tissue fluid to which it is applied, inhibiting bacterial growth.) As referred to above, honey contains an enzyme that converts glucose to hydrogen peroxide, an antibacterial agent. Also, as you mentioned, the antibacterial properties of honey appear to vary depending on the floral source. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Honey derived from Leptospermum trees (manuka) or Echium vulgare bush (viper's bugloss) showed antibacterial properties independent of hydrogen peroxide. It is believed that another, yet undiscovered, component of honey is responsible for the antibacterial properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, phenols are significant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antioxidant potential was dependent of honey extract concentration and the results showed that dark honey phenolic compounds had higher activity than the obtained from clear honey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been interesting studies of susceptibility of food-borne pathogen to honey, or potential for treatment of stomach ulcers with honey, but these are <em>in vitro</em> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assessment of the minimum inhibitory concentration by inclusion of manuka honey in the agar showed that all seven isolates tested had visible growth over the incubation period of 72 h prevented completely by the presence of <strong>5%</strong> (v/v) honey. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even in vitro, significant minimum inhibitory concentration started at about 9%, and against some organisms, 25%.</p>

<p>One paper isolating methylglyoxal (MGO) (and other agents) found Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey had very high amounts of MGO, up to 100-fold higher compared to conventional honeys. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whereas most of the honey samples investigated showed no inhibition in dilutions of 80% (v/v with water) or below, the samples of Manuka honey exhibited antibacterial activity when diluted to 15–30%, which corresponded to MGO concentrations of 1.1–1.8 mM. This clearly demonstrates that the pronounced antibacterial activity of New Zealand Manuka honey directly originates from MGO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this is to say concentration (as well as the source of the honey) matters. If one of the most consistently antibacterial honeys (manuka)has to be present in concentrations of at least 15% to be significantly antibacterial in vitro, unless you're chugging manuka honey, I don't <em>think</em> it will have a deleterious effect on your intestinal flora.</p>

"Difference between acute disease and chronic disease","1481","","<p>An acute disease can sometimes recover naturally, but always with a cure.</p>

<p>A chronic disease can't recover naturally and there is no cure.</p>

<p>Is this the difference ?</p>
","<p>More or less: Yes.</p>

<p>Acute and chronic are ways to classify diseases according to duration.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/acute+illness"">Acute</a>*</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Acute Illness (1) Any illness that develops quickly, is intense or severe and lasts a relatively short period of time.
  (2) Any condition—e.g., infection, trauma, fracture—with a short (often less than 1 month) clinical course. Acute illnesses usually respond to therapy; a return to a state of complete—pre-morbid—health is the norm.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>from: Segen's Medical Dictionary. © 2012 Farlex via The Free Dictionary</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.viha.ca/phc_cdm/cdm/what_is_chronic_disease.htm"">Chronic</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Chronic diseases are different. They usually develop slowly, last a long time, and are often progressive and incurable. For many chronic diseases, there is no cure. The long-term effects of a chronic illness may be difficult to predict.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>from: Island health</p>

<p>Note that most, but not all chronic illnesses are incurable. Also, although the illness is present all the time, the symptoms don't have to be. The time periods (which can be quite long) when the person doesn't have symptoms and feels well is called remission. When the symptoms appear this is called exacerbation or relapse. Many chronic illnesses that can't be cured can be well-managed and the consequences can be mitigated.</p>

<p>There are other categories between chronic and acute:</p>

<p><a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subacute"">subacute</a> - which can refer to duration (between acute and chronic, but closer to acute), to severity (often duration and severity combined: moderate) or it is sometimes used to denote a condition in a person who appears to be clinically well (although there are better terms for this, IMO).</p>

<p>subchronic - usually longer than acute, but limited in time (duration of illness is for about a year).</p>

<p>Subacute and subchronic (along with acute and chronic) are also used in toxicology to refer to classification of toxicity according to duration of exposure.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is no universal duration time for all illnesses, which would serve as the limit based on which the illness would be acute or chronic. The duration based on which conditions are classified often vary across different fields of medicine (i.e. different organs/organ systems). Consider these two examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Acute sinusitis - Duration of illness less than 3 weeks.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Sub acute sinusitis - Duration of illness ranging between 3-6 weeks.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Recurrent sinusitis - Recurrent sinusitis with disease free periods in-between attacks.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Chronic sinusitis - Duration of illness is more than 6 weeks</em></p>

"Do collagen supplements help ease some of the symtoms of Lupus?","1471","","<p>As someone recently diagnosed with borderline Lupus (I have all the symptoms except the butterfly rash), my doc recommended collagen supplements. Does it truly help ease the symptoms joint paint in Lupus? What brand of collagen would you recommend? I'm completely at a loss of which brand would be best for me. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p><em>Studies have shown that arthritis (joint inflammation) and arthralgias (joint pain) are reported in up to 95 percent of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</em></p>

<p><strong>There is currently no evidence for the use of collagen supplements in lupus patients.</strong> Actually, some decades ago, these supplements have been suggested in patients with osteoarthritis. The reason for this, is that the pathology of OA results from focal and progressive hyaline articular cartilage loss which leads to changes in the bone underneath the cartilage. However, while the prescription of collagen supplements was very trendy some decades ago, their use has slowly declined due to growing evidence failing to show an efficacy of these collagen supplements. Here the conclusion of a <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063458412007868"">systematic review</a> conducted in 2013 on this topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the generalized use of CHs
  in daily practice for the treatment of patients with OA.</strong> More
  independent high-quality studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic
  effects of collagen derivatives on OA complaints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this concerns osteoarthritis but it shows of controversial collagen supplements are.</p>

<p>As summarised in uptodate, <strong>treatment of arthritis in lupus patients relies on the following drugs</strong>: nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or hydroxychloroquine. For some patients acetaminophen may be useful. Glucocorticoids, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressives may also be required.</p>

<li>I am looking for an approximate upper bound on the number of eggs one can eat per day on average while staying healthy in the long run</li>
</ul>
","<p>Metabolic rate, individual genetics, cholesterol-absorption controversies, nutrients of the egg, size of the egg, and definition of ""maximum"" all contribute to ambiguity.
<a href=""http://www.eggnutritioncenter.org/egg-facts/nutrition-facts-panels/"">This list of egg sizes and corresponding nutrition panels with daily recommended values is a good starting place</a>, but I will also address this in a general context of what experts recommend and nutrient content.</p>

<p><strong>Cholesterol</strong></p>

<p>When people talk about eggs, they usually want to talk about cholesterol.</p>

<p>The problem is that the body doesn't fully absorb all of the cholesterol, so there's no hard rule. What we do know is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A large egg contains about 185 mg of cholesterol. <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/expert-answers/cholesterol/FAQ-20058468"">{2}</a></li>
<li>Although there is no precise basis for selecting a target level for<br>
dietary cholesterol intake for all individuals, the AHA recommends<br>
&lt;300 mg/d on average. <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/102/18/2284.full"">{3}</a></li>
<li>Your body doesn't absorb everything you eat. (That's part of why we go to the bathroom.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Registered dietitian Leslie Beck recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People at high risk for cardiovascular disease – e.g. people with diabetes, high cholesterol, and/or hypertension and smokers – should definitely limit their intake of egg yolks... some experts advise avoidance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, for healthy people with no medical condition, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are better strategies to guard against heart disease and stroke, not cutting down on eggs (for <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16340654/"">70</a> - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21776466"">75%</a> of the population). The two studies cited indicate that consumption of eggs does not raise cholesterol levels significantly for about 3/4ths of the population.</p>

<p><strong>Fat and Calories</strong></p>

<p>Each egg yolk contains 6 g of fat and 54 kcal. Even though they're full of nutrients, they still do contain calories, so factor that into your daily intake. Someone who does an average amount of physical activity would probably require an average amount of eggs. Definitely not something on the level of dozens, but even so, giving any numbers would be hard since there are so many factors in play.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamins and Minerals</strong></p>

<p>Eggs are naturally rich in vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium and iodine. They also contain vitamin A and a number of other B vitamins including folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline, and essential minerals and trace elements, including phosphorus. <a href=""http://www.egginfo.co.uk/egg-nutrition#sthash.ueExphBh.dpuf"">{6}</a></p>

<p>Before reaching a daily recommended value of any of these nutrients though, you would probably far exceed the daily recommended values for fat and calories first, but it's possible to overdose on anything, so be sure to keep track of how much of these nutrients are in each egg that you consume in the event that you're burning off all the fat and calories.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>To know your ""maximum"" number of eggs, you should probably talk to a dietitian.</p>

"How much cinnamon is too much?","1445","","<p>Cinnamon is touted to have many health benefits - <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/266069.php"">helping fight fungi, helping lower blood sugar, helping with lipid management, helping fight Alzheimer's</a> - <a href=""http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2013/12/30/cinnamon-offers-health-benefits-but-also-carries-serious-risks/"">but it also has a limit</a>. Ignoring whether the health claims are valid (I mostly am interested in the taste, although the supposed circulation boost would be nice), what is a good daily limit for cinnamon intake?</p>

<p>The closest I've seen to an answer was not more than 6 grams a day, 5 days a week (will cite when I find that again), with a warning to not take cinnamon daily as there needs to be a detox period. I would think a smaller dose would allow for a continuous usage. Also, keep in mind, the chemical thought to be the toxin in cinnamon that is linked to liver failure, coumarin, is much higher in cassia cinnamon than Ceylon cinnamon. Details on both would be nice.</p>

<p>There are two very distinct kinds of spices on the market which are commonly called ""cinnamon"". <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">True cinnamon</a> (derived from the plant <em>Cinnamomum verum</em>), also called Ceylon cinnamon and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamomum_cassia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cassia cinnamon</a> (derived from the plant <em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>). Although they are closely related they are different species and the distinction between the two was made early on since they are not only regionally separated but also tasting slightly different. And since your tongue might already tell you that: meaning their chemical composition is different. Concerning the quality of taste: true cinnamon is commonly described as milder, weaker, more elegant. Cassia on the other hand is cheaper per volume <em>and</em> more efficient to achieve a certain level of cinnamon taste.</p>

<p>I'll focus on cassia cinnamon rather than Ceylon (""natural cinnamon"") because the levels of coumarin are higher and it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>

"Can a woman tell which ovary, during ovulation, released the egg? Can she feel pain (due to follicle rupture) particular to one side?","1423","","<p>During ovulation, one of the de-graaf-follicles in one of woman's ovaries will rupture and release a mature egg, which will then descend through the Fallopian tubes and into the uterus, where it will implant into the endometrium, until the endometrium's lining is shed (if it's not fertilized), correct? </p>

<p>I know every woman is different, but is it possible for a woman to feel the rupture of the follicle/release of the egg, and essentially know which ovary contributed to that month's ovulation/menstruation? Like can she tell if it was the right or left ovary? (The ovaries switch off each month, right?) Is it common or rare? </p>
","<p>The rupture of the follicle is totally painless as it is not innervated.
However, some women experience ovulation pain. It is particular to one side, and the mecanism that cause pain are not fully understood. It is maybe due to the excessive size of the follicle that stretches the ovary or to irritation the abdomen.
<a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mittelschmerz/basics/symptoms/con-20025507"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On mayo clinic . com</a>, it is said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mittelschmerz [middle-pain, aka ovulation pain] pain occurs on the side of the ovary that's releasing an egg (ovulating). The pain may switch sides every other month, or you may feel pain on the same side for several months.</p>

"Is there any downside in consuming mint leaves frequently?","1409","","<p>This summer I have picked up a lot of mint in my garden.<br>
I have cleaned it and let it dry.</p>

<p>Now I have the habits to eat those dry leaves and making infusion very frequently (daily). 
I know there is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamiaceae"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a lot</a> of Mint species and some might not be as good as other.</p>

<p>This may seem like a weird question but I was wondering if it was a good habit to consume that much of mint leaves (~30 40 a day), is there any reason I should reduce my consummation ?</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
Here is a picture of the mint :</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIH8C.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIH8C.jpg"" alt=""peppermint""></a></p>

<p>It look like simple peppermint to me.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","<p>Before the answer I owe you an apology - the Mint family is large, and aside from a large number of species, each has a number of varieties. Different varieties of the same species might have similar chemical composition and pharmacological effects, but look a bit different. The fact is, that I'm not 100% sure from your photo that it is <em>Mentha x piperita</em> that we are talking about (most of my sources state that it has pink flowers; leaves are a shaped a bit differently but this might be because the plant is young); still, it might be. Determining the species is tricky even for professionals in such plant families (I was hoping that you got the name of the plant when you purchased it/got it from someone to plant in your garden).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I'll try to answer the best I can:</p>

<hr>

<p>The only <strong>contraindications</strong> for using <em>Mentha x piperita</em> (Peppermint) leaves or <em>Mentha arvensis pipericans</em> (Japanese Mint) are <strong>gallstones, gallbladder obstruction or inflammation</strong> - because most members of Mint family have a cholagogic effect (stimulate bile production and excretion) so the patient might experience colic if they use mint leaves, and medical supervision of such use is advisable.</p>

<p>For Peppermint the average daily dosage is 3-6 g/day (PDR) or 4.5 - 9g of the herbal substance, for preparation of herbal tea, divided in three doses (HMPC, EMeA).</p>

<p>Another contraindication listed for Peppermint in monograph at EMeA is <strong>heartburn</strong> (gastro-oesophageal reflux) because the condition might worsen with the use of peppermint.</p>

<p>Other from these, there are no known health risks associated with the use of these species, in recommended daily doses.</p>

<p>For: <em>Mentha longifolia</em> (English horsemint), <em>Mentha spicata</em> (Spearmint), <em>Mentha aquatica</em> (Wild mint), PDR states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No health hazards or side effects are known in conjunction
  with the proper administration of designated therapeutic
  dosages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, dosages are listed only for M. aquatica as one wineglass per day of infusion prepared from 30g of leaves and 500 ml of water.</p>

<p><em>Mentha pulegium</em> (Pennyroyal) is associated with hepatotoxicity (prolonged use can damage the liver). However, the plant in your photo doesn't look like M. pulegium to me. </p>

<hr>

<p>I' recommend taking a sample of your herb to a local botanical garden if possible and asking for help with species determination there, just to be on the safe side. A somewhat less reliable option would be to post the photo of the plant on biology SE and see what they think of it (but determining the species of the plant from a photo is less reliable than with an actual sample).</p>

<p>As for the quantity - I wasn't able to find a reliable source for the number of leaves used, so the safest method might be to measure the quantity you use and see if it fits the recommended doses (or to measure the maximal daily dose and try not to exceed it).</p>

"Will using fluoride-free toothpaste eventually lead to tooth decay?","1383","","<p>I've been using fluoride-free toothpaste for about a year now:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.desertessence.com/store/natural-tea-tree-oil-neem-toothpaste"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.desertessence.com/store/natural-tea-tree-oil-neem-toothpaste</a></p>

<p>While I'm not necessarily averse to fluoride - at least when used topically on the teeth - I'm skeptical of the safety of many chemicals used in typical brands of household products. This toothpaste seems to have safe ingredients, and it's pleasant to use and effective in keeping my mouth clean. I'd still use it if it contained fluoride, but I have yet to find a  ""healthy"" toothpaste that does.</p>

<p>Based on my research, it seems to be the consensus in dentistry that topical fluoride is a necessary part of maintaining tooth enamel. If I otherwise keep good dental habits, can I skip the fluoride and still maintain healthy enamel over the course of my lifetime? Or, should I look for a fluoride rinse, and would that be an effective replacement for toothpaste containing fluoride?</p>
","<p>First, some quote from British Fluoridation Society webpage (which text is based on some article authored by dr Levine, author of ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1061590"" rel=""nofollow"">The action of fluoride in caries prevention. A review of current concepts</a>""):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The relationship between fluoride and tooth decay is complex and probably not yet fully understood.</strong> However, it is known that fluoride interferes with the process of tooth decay in at least four ways: (1) If children ingest sufficient fluoride (...) up to 7 years of age the fluoride alters the structure of the developing enamel making it more resistant to acid attack. (2) (...) encourages remineralisation and ensures that the enamel crystals that are laid down are of improved quality. (...) low levels of fluoride in the mouth gradually improve the strength of the tooth enamel and its ability to resist acid attack. (3) (...) reducing the ability of the plaque bacteria to produce acid. <strong>This is a major factor in the prevention of tooth decay.</strong> (4) (...) if sufficient fluoride is ingested during childhood when the teeth are developing, it affects the depth of the fissures (grooves) on the biting surfaces of the teeth (...) thus reducing the ability of plaque to remain undisturbed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, let's analyze what is written above. Points (1) and (4) are important when you're a kid, they doesn't matter to you now. Point (2) is about improved self-repair and acid resistance. This is some very good property of fluoride, but it may not be so well understood and so effective as it is often presented. Quote from ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10777135"" rel=""nofollow"">Current concepts on the theories of the mechanism of action of fluoride.</a>"" (1999):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comparative studies of fluoride efficacy have shown that higher concentrations in solution are needed in pH-cycling studies of dentine than in enamel to maintain the mineral balance or to induce remineralization. (...) future perspectives for fluoride applications should be found in the retention and slow release of fluoride after various combinations of fluoride treatment, the combination of fluoride and anti-microbial treatment, the individualization of caries prevention, and the combination of preventive schemes with new developments in caries diagnosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(So this is not so simple just to have low levels of fluoride.)</p>

<p>If you sincerely keep good dental habits which include also proper diet and mouth washing, then you could rely on your natural remineralization. Keeping/restoring proper pH level would be important here. 
Point (3) is about bacteria and here things can get tricky. Bacteria evolve and it is not impossible that they will learn to deal with fluoride. Quote from ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327376"" rel=""nofollow"">New insight on the response of bacteria to fluoride.</a>"" (2012): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, the precise effects that fluoride has on bacteria and the mechanisms that bacteria use to overcome fluoride toxicity have largely remained unexplored. Recently, my laboratory reported the discovery of biological systems that bacteria use to sense fluoride and reduce fluoride toxicity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8704659"" rel=""nofollow"">some really bad-ass fluoride-resistant bacterias</a> are known to exist from a quite a long time now.</p>

<p>If you're not to use fluoride then again a lot will depend on your dental habits. If proper pH levels are maintained then ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteries in your mouth will keep themselves in some form of balance (hopefully).</p>

<p>Now, I think that it is important to explain what is the main function of toothpaste and general toothbrushing: it's <strong>mechanical surface abrasion</strong>. This is nicely summarized <a href=""http://www.thefactsabout.co.uk/how-does-toothpaste-work/content/115"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toothpastes contain mild abrasives which physically scrub away the plaque and food debris without damaging the tooth enamel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, in essence, has nothing to do with fluoride.</p>

<p>So, in my opinion, you can use fluoride-free toothpaste. If you'll be careful with pH levels, do mouthwash, be careful what you eat, then your natural tooth decay prevention mechanisms should work. <strong>But I don't guarantee anything</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, if I was to use fluoride-free toothpaste, I would like know if there exist some alternative chemical substance of similar properties. I haven't checked that and this is good material for another question.</p>

"How can CPR breathing be made less off-putting","1379","","<p>There is a long on-going discussion about the breathing part of CPR being so off-putting that it frightens people away from doing CPR altogether.  I was wondering what can be done to make it less off-putting, assuming one does not have paramedic equipment to hand.  </p>

<p>Obviously there is the miniature face mask, but most people do not bring that with them.</p>

<p>If the CPR is a two-person job, with the person pushing in charge, I could imagine telling the second person to clean the face with a tissue (assuming that starting with a delay is better than not starting) and then to breath through a second one.  </p>

<p>I have never done CPR in a real life situation, so input from someone who has would be of particular interest.</p>

<p>Edit: Very sorry, I should have said that I was specifically not looking for ""leave rescue breathing out"" as an answer; I think that is a whole topic of its own.</p>
","<p>That problem is already solved for you, at least in the US.</p>

<p>Current guidelines issued by the American Heart Association no longer require rescue breathing. Chest compressions alone are now <a href=""http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/Programs/HandsOnlyCPR/UCM_473196_Hands-Only-CPR.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the standard</a> for community CPR (vs professional CPR). They refer to it as <em>hands only CPR</em>.</p>

<p>On an anecdotal note, I've done mouth-to-mouth on a perfect stranger. He was a young adult male drowning victim. It's not as off-putting as you might think. However, had he vomited, which is common in cardiac arrest, that would have made me wish for a pocket mask. </p>

<p><strong>Edit in response to edit to the question:</strong></p>

<p>If protective equipment like a pocket mask isn't available and omitting mouth-to-mouth isn't an option, then there aren't many options left. A piece of cloth used as a barrier might help reduce the gross factor, but I doubt it will do much to protect you from bacteria and viruses. If vomit is present, you need to clear the airway first anyway, which should have been covered in your CPR class. If blood is present, now you have to ask yourself how much risk you're willing to take since you could be exposing yourself to dangerous bloodborne pathogens. Although it's okay to wipe the mouth and face off with a wet cloth, it's not okay to try and rinse the mouth. </p>

<p>Honestly, should you find yourself in the situation of using your CPR training, I think you'll find that you'll be too busy and focused to even notice the off-putting aspects unless the patient is a real mess. Just do what needs to be done and what your risk assessment allows you to do. You'll probably be surprised how much work CPR is. Even professionals come away from a 'code' sweating. </p>

"If I drink a lot of alcohol, will my urine be flammable?","1341","","<p>Well, maybe not pure alcohol, but let's say someone who had a heavy night of drinking and didn't drink water but only flammable beverages... Is there any chance his or her urine could be flammable?</p>

All quotes in this answer areas from that study. </p>

<p><em>Weak blood types</em></p>

<p>Weak blood types can be caused by a person having a mutation that leads to not expressing the type A or B antibodies as much, or by mutations in the genes coding for these that mean the antibodies they do produce react less when brought into contact with type A and B antigens for testing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These weak phenotypes, in majority of the
  cases result from the expression of an alternate weak allele present at the ABO loci.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weak type A and B are different, and there are also <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8036794"" rel=""nofollow"">different weak subtypes for each</a>. For example, here is a case study of a patient with weak type A blood (much of the research is on that, as it is more common than weak type B): <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16533287"" rel=""nofollow"">A weak blood group A phenotype caused by a translation-initiator mutation in the ABO gene.</a></p>

<p><em>Blood donors</em></p>

<p>Basically, weak type A or B blood donors's blood may be mistyped as being type O. If it is given to recipients with blood type O, these patients may experience blood agglutination which can be dangerous. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identification of these subgroups is important because these donors may be mistyped as group O individuals. Wrongly grouped as O, weak subgroups of A or B red cells (if transfused to O group individuals) can show decreased survival. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not concern your case, as it is about weak type A, but I'm including this for completeness sake: One of the weak type A groups, A<sub>x</sub> is special, in that people with this blood type should not donate for people with type A blood, as they actually have antibodies against the dominant type A antigen. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similarly since Ax individuals almost always have anti-A1 antibodies in their serum. If clinically significant, they can lead to fatal transfusion reactions on transfusing their whole blood or plasma to group A individuals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Blood recipients</em></p>

<p>None of the sources I could find went into much detail what this meant for receiving blood transfusions. None mentioned not being able to receive type A or B blood if the patient is a weak type A or B. </p>

<p>Being mistyped as O when receiving blood is not going to lead to any major problems - however, it means the person will only receive type O blood and not type A or B blood. In situations with a donor blood shortage this might be a disadvantage. </p>

<p>The researchers of the study told the donors, so they would know that their blood could not be given to a type O patient. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the donors were personally informed about their group and were given a special blood group card clarifying their donor as well as recipient status. </p>

"Can aluminum in pots with aluminum encapsulated base leak into food?","1269","","<p>Looking around as I am shopping for stainless steel pots (e.g. for boiling soup), the majority of them have aluminum encapsulated base (for better heat distribution, etc). Is there any concern regarding aluminum possibly leaking into food, as aluminum is generally considered not 100% safe from that point of view?</p>
","<p>No, ""aluminum encapsulated"" means the pan has a layer of aluminum bonded on to the <strong>exterior</strong> of the pan. The inner surface is stainless steel and perfectly safe because the aluminum never touches food.</p>

<p>This is just a less expensive version of copper-bottomed cookware. The copper is added for the same reason (heat distribution), but it's entirely on the exterior so never touches food.</p>

"Is it helpful to a dentist to report pain during a procedure?","1243","","<p>Suppose that a dentist is doing a standard dental procedure, e.g. drilling out decay, on me, and I start feeling pain as he does it. Assuming that I can handle the pain silently, so I don't <em>need</em> to report it for my own sake, is it at all helpful to the dentist's work for me to report it? Is this feedback that the dentist can use to detect issues with the actual work as he goes along, or would the only purpose of reporting it be to try to get him to do something to mitigate it, for the sake of my immediate experience?</p>

<p>(Note: I'm using ""me"" as a stand-in for a typical patient.) </p>
","<p>Most dentists - for <em>most</em> procedures - aim for a <em>painless</em> experience. If there is reason to keep some pain sensation intact, the dentist will inform you, and ask at appropriate intervals if you can feel pain.</p>

<p>The efficacy of lidocaine and other local anesthetics depends on how closely your nerve distribution comes to the norm (they will inject the environs of the ""normal"" anatomical position of the nerve), how much anesthetic is injected, whether there are local factors which alter the local tissue pH (e.g. presence of an abscess or infection), how quickly it is removed from the site, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this feedback that the dentist can use to detect issues with the actual work as he goes along, or would the only purpose of reporting it be to try to get him to do something to mitigate it, for the sake of my immediate experience?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Local anesthetics prevent pain sensation, but not vibration or pressure, which themselves can be unpleasant. Hypothetically, a dental procedure which should be painless with anesthesia can be carried out equally well whether the patient feels pain or not, so if you are stoic, feeling pain and not telling your dentist will not likely affect the outcome of that procedure. However, informing the dentist helps them to know if your anatomy is different (valuable information for the next time they need to do a similar local or regional block, your response to the anesthetic used (they might try another anesthetic or approach in the future), or if there might be an unseen infection altering the pH (and efficacy) of the anesthetic. Therefore it is probably wise to let your dentist know what you're feeling. They can reassess the situation, then offer you relief of some kind: a painless injection (the second injection into an already partially anesthetized region is truly painless), nitrous oxide (a gas), or other.</p>

<p>I would liken this for most instances to suturing a laceration. There is <em>never</em> a time when I wish the patient to feel pain while I'm addressing the repair. I address what I see. If a patient feels pain, I want to know that and address the situation.</p>

"How are ratios for one person CPR arrived at?","1218","","<p>I have not had a CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) class in 10 or more years, but I used to take them all the time (<em>like yearly</em>).  For one person CPR the ratio of compression to breaths was always changing.  In the US there were two major providers of approved CPR training, It was not unusual for both to have different ratios as ""the correct value"" at the same time, and the following year, one or both would be different. </p>

<p>How are the ratios determined? What impact if any do minor changes in the ratio have? </p>
","<p>Note: The following is excerpted from an article written in 2005. For lay (Non trained) people, there are more updated recommendations. The following is an example of the process, not the current recommendations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be effective, CPR must restore adequate coronary and cerebral blood flow. Interruptions in chest compressions lower coronary perfusion pressure and decrease rates of survival from cardiac arrest. In the first minutes of VF SCA, ventilation does not appear to be as important as chest compressions, but it does appear to contribute to survival from prolonged and asphyxial arrest. Certainly the ventilation rate needed to maintain a normal ventilation-perfusion ratio during CPR is much smaller than normal because pulmonary blood flow is low.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is one of the opening paragraphs <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/112/24_suppl/IV-206.full"">from this article</a> published on the American Heart Association (AHA) website from 2005, regarding CPR evaluation and recommended changes. (VF SCA = Ventricular Fibrillation Sudden Cardiac Arrest)</p>

<p>As a summation, a group of scientists and heart experts (281 experts over 36 months) gathered to review all the study and epidemiological data regarding survival rate in witnessed SCA. They reviewed the (then) current survival rates, sequence and priorities in CPR to see how differences affected the survival rate. There are 57 articles cited throughout the article that are all listed with links.</p>

<p>One of the biggest factors was that few people received early CPR, and those that did, it wasn't always effective CPR. Some of the factors that they found were that chest compressions were inadequately performed, slow, and often interrupted for too long for rescue breaths, especially among lay CPR performers (Non EMS trained). This resulted in inadequate cerebral blood flow and cardiac output.</p>

<p>Once they determined that, the following excerpt explains how they evaluated the recommended changes (at that time, this is a 2005 publication.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mathematical and animal models showed that matching of pulmonary blood flow and ventilation might be more appropriate at compression-ventilation ratios higher than 15:2. There was concern, however, particularly among pediatric experts, that inadequate ventilation rates could reduce survival from pediatric and asphyxial (eg, drowning) arrest. To achieve optimal compression rates and reduce the frequency of interruptions in compressions, a universal compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for all lone rescuers of victims from infancy (excluding newborns) through adulthood is recommended by consensus, based on integration of the best human, animal, manikin, and theoretical data available. The 30:2 ratio is recommended to simplify training in 1-rescuer or 2-rescuer CPR for adults and all lay rescuer resuscitation. A compression-ventilation ratio of 15:2 is recommended for 2-rescuer CPR (a skill taught chiefly to healthcare providers and lifeguards) for infants and children (to the onset of puberty). This recommendation will result in the delivery of more rescue breaths per minute of CPR to victims with a high prevalence of asphyxial arrest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, a panel of experts gets together and reviews current literature and reports on survival from both field and hospital based sources. Along with that they review changes and practices that have been implemented (There is reference to early Automatic External Defibrillator {AED} devices being a key factor in survival rates) since the last recommendation. They pair this with animal and computer modeling to determine what should used for compression rates and compression/breath ratios.</p>

<p>As far as the differences, I do not know how to account for those other than people using outdated information, or not following guidelines. Here in the United States, (as far as I know), all CPR certification falls under the guidelines of the AHA.</p>

"When to take a blood test after a gout attack","1206","","<p>Gout is caused by an elevated level of uric acid in the blood, which results in crystals forming in the joints. Once this reaches a critical level, the body responds by targeting the crystals, resulting in inflammation and severe pain.</p>

<p>When there is suspicion that a patient has gout, he is typically sent for a blood test, to evaluate his blood level of uric acid. What I am wondering, is whether it matters how long after a gout attack this blood test is taken?</p>

<p>As such, which of the following statements are true:</p>

<p>1) During a gout attack, the level of uric acid in the blood drops due to the body's response to remove the crystals. Therefore, the patient should have the blood test several weeks after the attack, to ensure the uric acid levels are back to their stable level. It doesn't matter what the patient eats during these weeks, because the uric acid level is dependent on long-term dietary habits, rather than the very recent diet.</p>

<p>2) Similar to 1), the patient needs to wait a few weeks before the blood test. However, the patient also needs to ensure that he eats according to his ""standard"" diet during this period, because uric acid levels are dependent on short-term dietary habits. For example, if the patient cuts down on foods causing the uric acid during this period (e.g. red meat and alcohol), then the level of uric acid during the test will not be a typical measurement.</p>

<p>3) The level of uric acid does not decrease dramatically after a gout attack, and the blood test can be taken soon after.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>Diagnosis of gout is based on clinical examination and arthrocentesis (to detect the presence of monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid).</strong></p>

<p><strong>The use of serum uric acid (sUA) levels is</strong> <strong>limited</strong> <strong>in acute gout flare</strong> and can be difficult to interpret. If acute gout attack is suspected in a patient, an elevated sUA (≥6.8 mg/dL) can lend support to the diagnosis but is neither diagnostic nor required to establish the diagnosis. Normal sUA levels have been reported in patients with acute gout flare <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581951"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></p>

<p><strong>To your question:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The most accurate time for assessment of serum uric acid levels (and establishment of a baseline value) is two weeks or more after complete subsidence of an acute gout flare.</strong></p>

"What should I do if someone has a seizure in front of me?","1205","","<p>What first-aid measures should be taken when someone is having a seizure?</p>
","<p>The typical scenario of a seizure is:</p>

<ol>
<li>loss of consciousness</li>
<li>uncontrolled movements</li>
<li>recovery</li>
</ol>

<p>The conduct to adopt during each of these phases follows:</p>

<h2>During 1. and 2.</h2>

<p>The person will fall on the ground if standing and may get hurt, either due to the fall or due to the uncontrolled movements that will follow.</p>

<p><strong>The only things you can (and should) do at that stage</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>If possible, <strong>ease the victim to the floor</strong> when falling, without restricting his/her movements. Be careful for yourself. Do not face the person (you could get punched, and even a thin person is very strong in such cases), stand on his/her back.</li>
<li><strong>Should the victim wear eyeglasses, remove them carefully</strong>. If you can, carefully loosen clothes or jewellery around the neck.</li>
<li><strong>Insert a cushion or some folded clothes under the victim's head</strong>. Here again, be careful not being hit and do not restrict the victim's movements.</li>
<li><strong>Clear the area</strong>: remove any object that can be dangerous for the victim. </li>
<li><strong>Be calm and reassuring for people around</strong>. Ask them to stay away from the victim, or to go next room should this happen inside a building. Ask at least one to stay at your disposal in case of need. This may be useful later.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor how long this phase lasts</strong>.</li>
<li>If you're not aware of the victim's history with seizure, try to find any card or jewellery mentioning it.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are things <strong>you should absolutely avoid doing</strong> as they would do way more bad than good:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT hold the victim or restrain his/her movements.</strong> The victim may hurt him/herself, the only thing you should do is to secure the area as much as you can (see above).</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT insert anything into the victim's mouth.</strong> The victim is NOT going to swallow his/her tongue. </li>
<li><strong>DO NOT try to make the victim bite anything.</strong> No belt, no pencil, nothing. The victim may bite his/her own tongue, you cannot and should not try to prevent that.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT move the victim</strong>, unless there is an immediate, real, and out-of-control danger.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT leave the victim on his/her own.</strong> Don't stay too close, though. Be careful for yourself and get ready to do some more securing should this be needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>During 3.</h2>

<p>The victim will not necessarily be aware of what happened, and will need time to recover. He/she might be disoriented/confused, and he/she may have lost urine during the previous phase. You should calmly expect both signs.</p>

<p>There are some do's and don't here, as well:</p>

<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gently put the victim in recovery position</strong> (on a side: <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Accidents-and-first-aid/Pages/The-recovery-position.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">video and explanations here</a>). </li>
<li>As long as the victim has not recovered consciousness, <strong>ensure the victim still breathes</strong>. To do this, approach your ear to his/her mouth, while looking at his/her chest, for 10 seconds. This allows you to hear the sound of breathing, feel his/her breath, and see the movements of his/her chest. <strong>Should you perceive none of these that's a medical emergency</strong> (potential cardiac arrest, which is another question<sup>1</sup>) - This is quite unlikely to happen but you have to check.</li>
<li><strong>Without being intrusive</strong>, visually check whether urine seems to appear on the person's clothes. <strong>Failing to determine this is not a problem.</strong></li>
<li>During the recovery, <strong>speak calmly, be friendly and gentle</strong>. </li>
<li>Once the victim has regained enough consciousness, <strong>explain what happened and be reassuring</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ask the victim to show his/her tongue, and explain why</strong>. He/she can be hurt without knowing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Depending on what you know or discovered regarding the victim's history with seizure, and depending on the time the previous phase lasted, you may have to call the medical emergency services</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should the last phase (1. + 2.) have lasted more than 5 minutes</li>
<li>Should this be the first time the person has a seizure</li>
<li>Should the person have stopped breathing</li>
<li>Should another loss of consciousness occurs </li>
<li>Should another series of uncontrolled movements occurs</li>
<li>Should the person remain disoriented after a few minutes of recovery</li>
<li>Should the person be aggressive/violent</li>
<li>Should the person be hurt </li>
<li>Should the person be a pregnant woman</li>
<li>Should the person ask you to call the emergency services</li>
<li>Or <strong>should you have any doubt</strong>, assume you should call the emergency medical services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When calling the medical emergency services</strong>, </p>

<ul>
<li>Don't be in a hurry, stay calm.</li>
<li>Tell your name, phone number, current location,</li>
<li>Tell this is for a seizure, and tell the victim's gender and age</li>
<li>Describe the victim's condition, tell what of the above makes you call, tell whether there is a loss of urine or any injury.</li>
<li>They will guide you. Do whatever they tell you and answer any question.</li>
<li><strong>Do NOT hang up the phone before instructed to do so</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should no emergency call be needed</strong>, offer some help to the person: </p>

<ul>
<li>Lead him/her away from any danger, a quiet bench nearby is appropriate should you be outside. </li>
<li>Offer him/her to call a friend, a relative or a cab.</li>
<li>In the US, and probably in some other countries, it's illegal to drive within 6 months after having had an unexplained seizure (not caused by eclampsia, hypoxia, head injury, etc.). Should this be the case, you don't have to force the person not to drive, but you can strongly discourage it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Don't:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't speak fast</strong> or act in any way that could frighten the victim. Keep in mind the recovery phase is a slow process during which the victim feels dizzy and confused.</li>
<li><strong>Don't propose water or food before complete recovery or if you had to call the medical emergency services.</strong> In this last case, ask them whether you can propose anything.</li>
</ul>

"Is food prepared in a microwave oven less healthy?","1168","","<p>There are people who avoid preparing their food in microwave ovens for various health-related reasons. The claims most often stated are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microwave radiation is harmful.</li>
<li>Microwaving destroys vitamins and other nutrients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any scientific evidence to suggest that microwaved food is less healthy compared to food prepared in more conventional ways?</p>
","<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong>: No, food cooked via a microwave oven is generally not less healthy than food cooked by other methods. </p>

<hr>

<p>In general, cooking by any method destroys or reduces nutrient value<sup><a href=""http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/cooking-food-reduce-vitamin-content-5164.html"">1</a>,<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/health/17real.html?_r=0"">4</a></sup>. This is due to a number of factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Solubility. Water-soluble nutrients (like Vitamin B, C) are highly prone to leach out if cooking in water<sup><a href=""http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/fresh-ideas/dinner-food-facts/does-cooking-vegetables-diminish-their-nutrients.htm"">2</a></sup> (boiling, for example). Fat-soluble nutrients are at a similar risk when cooking in a fat medium or when the fat is lost in the process (e.g., frying, grilling)<sup><a href=""http://www.eufic.org/article/en/expid/cooking-review-eufic/"">5</a></sup>.</p></li>
<li><p>Heat. Both fat- and water-soluble nutrients are susceptible to heat from any cooking source, while mineral nutrients are less so<sup><a href=""http://www.eufic.org/article/en/expid/cooking-review-eufic/"">5</a></sup>. </p></li>
<li><p>Duration. Methods with shorter cook times (e.g., stir-frying, blanching, microwaving) reduce the effects of heat degradation because the food is not exposed to heat for as long<sup><a href=""http://www.eufic.org/article/en/expid/cooking-review-eufic/"">5</a></sup>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(It's not even always a loss: some nutrients are <em>more</em> available after cooking, because heat breaks down thick cell walls that our digestive system has trouble with, which means that the nutrients are easier for our bodies to uptake<sup><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/raw-veggies-are-healthier/"">3</a></sup>.)</p>

<p>Each cooking method has a <strong>different combination</strong> of the above factors, and so has different effects on nutrients in food. Microwave cooking has the advantage of not cooking in water, and being able to reach a higher heat in a shorter time. Depending on the food, this means that microwaving is sometimes <em>better</em> at preserving nutrients. For example, boiling spinach causes a much higher loss (77% vs. almost none) of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"">folate</a> compared to microwaving<sup><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/health/17real.html?_r=0"">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, when people make claims about microwaved food being less healthy, they are <em>usually</em> referring to a fear that the act of microwave heating (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating#Microwave_heating"">dielectric heating</a>) is 'unnatural' in some way, or is subjecting the food to dangerous radiation (which may then be ingested). This is simply not supported<sup><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/resourcesforyouradiationemittingproducts/ucm252762.htm"">9</a></sup> by scientific literature, which indicates that microwave ovens, when used properly, are safe and effective -- with <strong>two caveats</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Human milk. The CDC<sup><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/recommendations/handling_breastmilk.htm"">6</a></sup> does not recommend heating human milk in the microwave, because of the risk of uneven heating of the liquid (which could scald a baby), and because there is some evidence<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1557249"">7</a></sup> that it decreases its anti-infective properties.</p></li>
<li><p>Superheating of liquids. If water is heated in a microwave in a smooth container, it can pose a risk of scalding due to superheating<sup><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/resourcesforyouradiationemittingproducts/ucm252762.htm"">9</a></sup>. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheating#Occurrence_via_microwave_oven"">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Superheating can occur when an undisturbed container of water is heated in a microwave oven. When the container is removed, the water still appears to be below the boiling point. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling water out of the container. [...] There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a popsicle stick in the glass or using a scratched container.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, microwaving food is a safe alternative to cooking via other methods<sup><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/resourcesforyouradiationemittingproducts/ucm252762.htm"">9</a></sup>. Any cooking method will decrease the nutritional value of food, but this is usually an acceptable tradeoff because of the benefits gained from cooking<sup><a href=""http://www.eufic.org/article/en/expid/cooking-review-eufic/"">5</a></sup>. Microwaves do not cause food to be radioactive or acutely dangerous in any way.</p>

  <p>Researchers have found that the reason why a man's testicles rest
  outside the body in the scrotum rather than in the abdomen like the
  ovaries is because the ideal temperature for sperm production is three
  to four degrees below normal body temperature. Any warmer will affect
  sperm count, slashing it by about 40 percent per one-degree rise.
  Temporary overheating of the testicles can result from exposure to
  things such as saunas, hot tubs, heating blankets, even waterbeds.</p>

In other words, ""Hold off wearing glasses for as long as possible, because once you start, it gets much worse.""</p>

<p>The claim is that with glasses, the eyes don't have to work as hard to focus and then become ""lazier"" (for lack of a better term), leading to a vicious cycle of needing more and more correction.</p>

","<p>According to the Mayo Clininc, <strong>no</strong>. They write in their eye myths and facts section:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Myth: Wearing eyeglasses will weaken the eyes:</strong> The eyeglasses worn to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia will not weaken the eyes any more than they will permanently ""cure"" these kinds of vision problems. Glasses are simply external optical aids that provide vision to people with blurred vision caused by refractive errors. Exceptions are the kinds of glasses given to children with crossed eyes (strabismus) or lazy eye (amblyopia). These glasses are used temporarily to help straighten the eyes or improve vision.

"Do vitamins affect sense of taste?","1148","","<p>I like oranges. I <em>really</em> like oranges. But I go through cycles of eating them. When I start, they are <em>really</em> sweet. By my fifth of the day they have turned quite bitter.</p>

<p>Sensing a pattern I have performed an experiment.</p>

<p>The theory is that the more vitamin C I eat, the less I want foods that contain vitamin C. So, I stopped eating oranges for a month. I had one orange and it was really sweet - which validates the inverse of my theory (the less vitamin C I eat the more I want foods that contain it).</p>

<p>I then started taking vitamin C tablets for a week and had an orange, and it was bitter. To make sure it wasn't just a bitter orange I asked a friend to share it with me (without explaining why I wanted to share the orange with him). He said it was very sweet and enjoyed it loads.</p>

<p>I have been unable to locate studies or anecdotes regarding this sort of thing.</p>

<p>So, my question:</p>

<p>Do our bodies alter our taste buds based on what we eat in order to maintain a stable balance of nutrients, vitamins, etc? (by encouraging/discouraging us to eat food x because we need/don't need the nutrients/vitamins/etc)?</p>

<p>I have previously noticed a similar alteration in sense of taste for spinach for a little while. I assume I needed the iron? </p>

<p>From an evolutionary point of view this makes sense - as a way of encouraging us to eat what we need to stay healthy.</p>
","<p>So it's important to separate cravings/<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_hunger"" rel=""noreferrer"">specific hungers</a> from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"" rel=""noreferrer"">taste</a>.  </p>

<p>One's body should, to some degree be able to adjust it's specific hungers to meet it's dietary needs.  This one area where our larger brains come with a catch 22.  While being smarter and aware allows us to feed ourselves better, we also can ignore or improperly process the bodies attempt to control our appetites.</p>

<p>Moving on to taste buds (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24287552"" rel=""noreferrer"">here is a better review than wiki</a>).  The average taste bud lasts 8-12 days (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24287552"" rel=""noreferrer"">ibid</a>), so if you're noticing an effect before then, it's probably not related.  Also, there development and distribution is associated with genetic and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"" rel=""noreferrer"">epigenetic</a> factors, not environment and diet.</p>

<p>Instead I think that you are noticing that your taste receptors, like most sensory systems, become less responsive after saturation and repeated stimulation.</p>

<p>If we look at part F of the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345348/"" rel=""noreferrer"">following figure</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jabfv.jpg"" alt=""Choi et al figure 5""></p>

<p>You will notice how the response of the taste bud to a salty solution decreased significantly after each application (the time between each stimulus was 10 min).  Thus something that started as tasty and salty 30 min ago won't by the time you've finished gorging yourself on oranges.</p>

<p>A way to test this at home, <strong>with the extreme caveat that I do not recommend super dosing vitamin C</strong>, would be to try this with a fixed dose (appropate for age and weight) of vitamin C dissolved in water over the same interval you were eating the oranges.  I think you will notice little to no change in the taste of the vitamin C unless you are doing it in a very short amount of time.</p>

","<p>Sleeping in a prone position is not bad. However there are some complications of it that can be negative. A simple example is drooling. A more important problem with sleeping in a prone position is poor posture. Most people don't have a bed like a chiropractic table that allows them to breathe with their face straight down while maintaining a neutral spine. Due to this lack of beds designed for the prone sleeper they have to turn their head to the side. This extreme rotation held for 8 hours can cause neck pain. Most people who sleep that way also use a pillow under their head and/or upper body causing excessive and prolonged lumbar extension. This can lead to low back pain. <a href=""http://www.acatoday.org/JacaDisplay1.cfm?CID=4488&amp;DisType=PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">J Amer Chiropr Assoc 2011 May-June;48(4):17-18</a></p>

<p>The textbooks and the research I've seen always say the best sleep position maintains a neutral spine. That means on your back with a pillow supporting your neck and one supporting your knees. Alternatively you can sleep on your side with a pillow supporting your neck, head, and the top arm as well as a pillow between the knees. This will keep the spine in a neutral position. I always tell my patients that the best way to sleep is the one that gives you a good, full nights sleep. You can probably improve your sleep with a few modifications, but if you are a side sleeper, you'll have a difficult time trying to force yourself to your back because, you're not conscious at the time. The Mayo Clinic has some excellent <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/back-pain/multimedia/sleeping-positions/sls-20076452?s=3"" rel=""nofollow"">images</a> that can help with modifications. </p>

<p>People tend to sleep in positions that are comfortable for them. If all day long they sit or work in a flexed posture then their body may crave the extension of their low back that comes from prone positions. In fact they may sleep prone because of back pain caused by excessive flexion. We've all seen this phenomenon before as we squirm in our chair or our legs ache to stretch when on a long flight or car ride. Motion and proper posture affects every aspect of our life.

<p>Professor McDonald, citing limited research, concludes dimples have been mislabeled as genetically inherited and as a dominant trait. However, the University of Utah considers dimples an ""irregular"" dominant trait that is probably controlled mostly by one gene but is influenced by other genes.</p>

<p>The truth is that dimples are actually genetic defects that are caused by shortened facial muscles.</p>

<p>Dimples are caused by a fault in the subcutaneous connective tissue that develops in course of the embryonic development. A variation in the structure of the facial muscle may also cause dimples.</p>

<p>I am at a loss and don't know which practitioner to see next, any advice would be great.</p>

<p><strong>More information about my knees:</strong>
The physiotherapist used the umbrella term ""Runners knee"", it certainly helps describe the symptoms I am experiencing but is perhaps a bit vague. I would say a definite weakness there when exerting myself, and eventually pain / inflammation afterwards. To me it feels like a cartilage issue.
I have tried supplements including: Bone broth, Glucosamine and chondroitin but still no difference. 
My knee condition became much worse after repeated exercise on my bicycle, eventually I just couldn't ride it any more. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Please Note: This is not a diagnosis, it is being provided to help you and a health care professional understand possible causes of your
  condition.  You must see a local professional for an evaluation and
  orthopedic testing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Runners Knee is also known as ""Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS)"" which essential describes the symptoms not the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>So you basically were given a term to describe what you already knew (not exactly useful).  I’m surprised further testing was not done.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chondromalacia Patella</h2>

<p>From the limited information I have it sounds like <strong>Chondromalacia Patella</strong>.<br>
Which is the combination of patellar tracking issues and deterioration of articular cartilage on the posterior surface of the patella.</p>

<p>I would have to perform special orthopedic tests to narrow down the cause.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Essentially the information below is what your PT should be looking for to rule in / out this diagnosis <em>(normally the information below isn’t given to
  patients but it sounds like you’ve been getting nowhere with this --
  hopefully this gives your PT   a direction to figure out what is going
  on)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Clinical Picture</h2>

<ul>
<li>Generally there is a gradual onset of diffuse aching pain over the
anterior or anteromedial aspect of the knee.</li>
<li><p>There may or may not be inflammatory signs.</p></li>
<li><p>There is often crepitus (cracking) as the knee moves thru its ROM</p></li>
<li><p>There is an exacerbation of pain with activities such as squatting,
kneeling, and ascending stairs.</p></li>
<li><p>There is what is referred to as a positive movie sign – that means
that refers to seating in a movie – fair amount of flexion – will get
achy in the ant/medial knee to the extent where you have to change
position or shake out the knee – patient may also have a feeling of the
knee catching or giving way.</p></li>
<li>Typically see mechanical causes of this pathology – will affect not
only tracking but also the contact surface areas of the PF jt</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Etiology – Mechanical Causes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Genu Valgum (means knee) – where we are going to see an increase in the valgus vector at the knee- which is going to affect tracking.</li>
<li>Femoral Anteversion</li>
<li>Excessive Internal Femoral Rotation- alters the Q angle which
increases the lateral stresses.</li>
<li>Patella Alta – if the length of the patellar tendon exceeds the top
to bottom displacement of the patella by 15% or 1 cm</li>
<li>Laxity of medial capsular retinaculum</li>
<li>Tightness of the lateral retinaculum</li>
<li>Acute or chronic patellar subluxations</li>
<li>Pronation of the foot</li>
<li>External Tibial Torsion</li>
<li>Weakness of the VMO</li>
</ol>

<p>This pathology – referred from the floor up – or from the hip down </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually there is something going on above or below the joint – results
  in this pathology – must find what is causing this to be successful</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>If you understand the cause you will be able to effectively plan the
intervention</p></li>
<li><p>There are things you can’t fix- structural deformities – if it
involves structures that displace the patella laterally</p></li>
<li><p>The follow will also alter patellar tracking.  Excessive pronation of the foot, weakness of VMO, tightness of lateral retinaculum  or ITB (ober , patellar tilt test) , weakness of frontal plane hip muscles</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Misc Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Terminal Extension Exercises - Don’t strengthen the VMO</li>
<li>Open Kinetic Chain (OKC) – the literature says the OKC ex from a position of 90-45 degrees of flexion is the safe arc in terms of joint reaction forces to do open chain work</li>
<li>Close Kinetic Chain (CKC) - that arc of safe movement – is from 0-60 degrees of knee flexion </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What Professional(s) to See</h2>

<p>An outpatient physical therapist should be able to narrow this down. As far as Musculoskeletal related issues the leading experts in this field are orthopedic surgeons <em>(with physical therapists being #2).</em>  </p>

<p><strong><em>Professional Bias</em></strong><br>
However be aware just like a PT will advocate therapeutic exercise - a surgeon will tend to lean toward surgery.</p>

Does it mean that my teeth have shifted during the day? What is the recommended amount of time to wear a retainer? Also, is it ok to drink water with a retainer on?</p>
","<p>I will answer your questions separately:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Teeth can shift on their own</strong>, due to the fact that they are supported by the periodontal ligament (PDL) that holds the teeth by their roots in your mouth, while still allowing them to move slightly. Think of it as a shock absorber. </p>

<p>Most movement of teeth happens due to pressure that is applied to your teeth (ex: biting when eating) but also when an orthodontist slowly moves the teeth into place by having the orthodontic wire push and pull your teeth in a certain way for a long time. </p>

<p>Wearing a retainer is important, to prevent the teeth from returning to the way they were before wearing braces. The periodontal ligament has a certain memory and will tend to ""spring"" back to where it was before.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Your orthodontist should tell you exactly how often and how long you should wear the retainer.</strong> Here is an example of what an orthodontist might tell you: ""Some retainers are used full-time for the first 6 months; after that, the retainers are worn only at night, for a few years. Other retainers are worn full-time for about a week, and solely at night thereafter. Fixed retainers are normally kept in place for 5 years"" [1]</p>

","<p>Inesophet actually had a good answer there, and I'll expand on that. </p>

<p>Pheomelanins impart a pink to red hue, depending upon the concentration. They are particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are two types of eumelanin: brown eumelanin and black eumelanin—which chemically differ from each other in their pattern of polymeric bonds. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow (blond) color hair.</p>

Or maybe better: what is the <em>function or use</em> of a second bone in the lower arm/leg?</p>
","<p>The reasons for 2 bones in your lower arm can be to help your hand turn and give you more control over it. The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint and has large muscles to help control it. Since the movements and actions of a wrist and shoulder are different, different joints were needed. Wrist are more delicate and do a lot different precise task. This distribution of bones also helps keep the body strong and keep balance. More bones always equals more flexibility. We need more flexibility distal of our joints than at the joints. </p>

"What is the difference between inflammation and irritation?","1070","","<p>I wonder what the difference is between inflammation and irritation, especially in the context of tendinopathies.</p>

<p>I sometime see the two terms employed synonymously, e.g. in this <a href=""http://www.healthline.com/symptom/tendon-inflammation"" rel=""nofollow"">Healthline article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tendons are thick cords that join your muscles to your bones. When these tendons become <strong>irritated or inflamed</strong>, it is called tendinitis. This condition causes acute pain and tenderness, making it difficult to move the affected joint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or this <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/wilmer/conditions/allergic_conjunctivitis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Johns Hopkins University article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allergic conjunctivitis is <strong>inflammation or irritation</strong> of the clear mucous membrane lining the inner eyelids and sclera. This lining is called the conjunctiva. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the context of tendinopathies, I would tend to believe they are synonymous as I cannot  think of any other type of irritation other than inflammation, but I am not sure.</p>
","<p>The following is derived from my education (MD).</p>

<p>In the medical field, inflammation has a specific meaning even though its use is broad.  Whenever you see a word ending with <strong>-itis</strong>, the suffix represents inflammation.  Inflammation is a response from your body to some kind of trigger (such as infection, trauma, against yourself (autoimmune), et cetera).  Inflammation is defined usually to have the <strong>""4 -or's""</strong> which are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rubor - redness</li>
<li>Dolor - pain</li>
<li>Tumor - increase in size (swelling)</li>
<li>Calor - heat</li>
</ol>

<p>These are caused by the inflammatory response which heavily includes immune cells.</p>

<p>Irritation is not a medically well defined word.  We use it to mean something is just responding to a trigger.  We use it often to describe inflammation in layman's terms.  It is not something you can look too much into.  Any dictionary definition will do.  The connotation is usually negative (so it is a bad thing in general).</p>

<p><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B017EXC47C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/WoodyKnows%C2%AE-Pollutant-Second-hand-Anti-Pollution-Replacement/dp/B017EXC47C/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459403327&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=nostril+filters</a></p>

<p>to reduce the risk. Any opinions on this?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, you can't make a probabilistic estimate if you will contract heart disease or some form of cancer - there are too many variables to consider. How big is the room? How many people are smoking? Some people smoke all their life and die without cancer or disease - though poor lung function. But I found some interesting information, we can use it to make an estimation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is estimated that only 15% of cigarette smoke gets inhaled by the
smoker. The remaining 85% lingers in the air for everyone to breathe.</p></li>
<li><p>If a person spends more than two hours in a room where someone is<br>
smoking, the nonsmoker inhales the equivalent of four cigarettes.    </p></li>
<li><p>Secondhand smoke is the third leading preventable cause of disability
and early death (after active smoking and alcohol) in the United<br>
States. For every eight smokers who die from smoking, one innocent<br>
bystander dies from secondhand smoke.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Enclosed smoking areas are far more toxic than exposure to second-hand smoke from bystanders outside. Anti-smoking campaigns (rightfully) tend to exaggerate a bit, if there's one person smoking one cigarette, you won't absorb four cigarettes... So my estimate is that within your 4 hours you will absorb 1-5 cigarettes worth of toxins, depending on how many people are smoking, how large the room is, and how well ventilated it is.</p>

<p>A one-time exposure for four hours is definitely statistically negligible, but it sounds like you want to do this regularly. 4 weeks in a month are equivalent to 4-20 cigarettes smoked. In a year that's exposure equivalent to 48-240  cigarettes. Let's say you will not go to the casino three months of the year, and we take the average of that estimate. That puts you in the ballpark of 120 cigarettes a year, or 1/3rd of a cigarette per day. Clinically, smoking is estimated in pack years <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack-year"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack-year</a> and this estimate is far below a pack year - there are no studies concerning such a low amount of consumption I could find.</p>

<p>But it still boils down to regular exposure to carcinogens, which one way or another raises your risk. Smokers go through much more tobacco, so studies are hard to find for such a low exposure, but it is definitely significant. If you go to the casino once a month for 4-5 hours you will be fine. But if you're concerned about long-term health I wouldn't go every week. Also gambling can be more addicting than tobacco. ;)</p>

<p>Hope this estimate helps you.</p>

"Is kimchi low FODMAP?","1040","","<p>I would like to know whether kimchi, the fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with a variety of seasonings, also known as kimchee or gimchi, can generally be considered low FODMAP. </p>

<p>This might not be a straight answer as there are many varieties of kimchi and the dish in itself contains many different types of vegetables, but if we remove garlic and onion, and reduce its definition to the main ingredient which is usually fermented cabbage, can we say that Korean style fermented cabbage is a low FODMAP dish?</p>

<p>Common cabbage and red cabbage (but not Savoy cabbage) feature as low FODMAP in the Monash University FODMAP app, but sauerkraut, which is fermented white cabbage, is not. </p>

"How important is the amount of active ingredient in an ointment?","1036","","<p>I own a small tin of ""Dr Chase"" ointment that is probably 40 years old. This stuff is amazing. In my family we save it for particularly stubborn or difficult cuts and sores because it will heal anything. Recently, I had something on my leg that Polysporin was not helping - after a week of twice daily Polysporin I got out the Dr Chase and in two days it was better. It is a matter of family legend that it must contain radiation or mercury or something because it is just not like any other ointment. </p>

<p>As far as I know, it's not made any more. I would love to replace my tin and use it more often, but I haven't been able to find it. However, I can read the back of the tin just fine and it consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zinc Oxide, 18.6 % w/w</li>
<li>Phenol, 0.59% w/w</li>
</ul>

<p>Zinc Oxide suspensions are easy to find (diaper cream) but they don't have phenol in them. I have turned up a Canadian ointment (how convenient, I am in Canada) called Ozonol that contains 0.18% phenol and 3.72% zinc oxide. How likely is this to be as good? The Dr Chase is a tiny little tin, 2"" across, and you use very little at a time of this very thick ointment - it's just like diaper cream. The Ozonal comes in a tube. Perhaps I could just use more each time?</p>

<p>Is the more dilute cream likely to be a reasonable substitute for the thick ointment?</p>
","<p>Before I answer your question: <strong>40 years is a very long time.</strong> Your ointment should have an expiration date. You should not use it past that date. Not just that microbiological quality can't be guaranteed after that much time (not even with phenol which might have preserved it to a point, but not for 40 years), but also the chemical composition might have changed - both the active substances and the excipients might have underwent various chemical reactions - and no one can say with any certainty what you've got in there now.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, onto your question: <em>How important is the amount of active ingredient in an ointment?</em> </p>

<p>It depends on the ingredient. The <strong>concentration</strong> is important because both safety and efficacy/effectiveness depend on it. Some ingredients have a very wide range of concentrations in which they are proven to be both safe and effective; others have a very narrow range of concentrations in which they should/(are recommended to) be used; some are somewhere in between. You are asking about an ointment with lesser concentrations of active substance than the one you previously used, so the efficacy of the 'new' ointment is what you are concerned with. </p>

<h2>Phenol</h2>

<p>Phenol is used as an antiseptic in your ointments. The efficacy of antiseptics depends on many factors including:</p>

<ul>
<li>concentration</li>
<li>acidity (pH value) of the solution/medium/preparation</li>
<li>duration of exposure</li>
<li>the type(s) and number of microorganisms present</li>
<li>presence of organic matter (especially in forming a biofilm)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the concentration is important, but there are other factors to be taken into account. </p>

<p>According to Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference (34th edition), the Phenol monograph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aqueous solutions up to 1% are bacteriostatic while stronger solutions are bactericidal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both ointments you used contain phenol in bacteriostatic (inhibits growth of bacteria) and not bacteriocidal (kills bacteria) concentrations. </p>

<p>There is various research on a MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) of phenol:</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88911/"" rel=""nofollow"">Antiseptics and Disinfectants: Activity, Action, and Resistance</a> G. McDonnell, A. D. Russell</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Pulvertaft and Lumb (386) demonstrated that low concentrations of phenols (0.032%, 320 μg/ml) and other (nonphenolic) agents lysed rapidly growing cultures of E. coli, staphylococci, and streptococci</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the same source (based on references 226 and 440 provided in that research paper):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the MIC of phenol against <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>E. coli</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is 2,000 μg/ml (which is <strong>0.2%</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00257609#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">Protection of bacteria against toxicity of phenol by immobilization in calcium alginate</a>  Heribert Keweloh, Hermann-Josef Heipieper, Hans-Jürgen Rehm have used solutions of phenol in both 1 g/l (0.1%) and 2 g/l (0.2%) concentrations and got inhibition of growth of some bacteria (although they were testing something else, and I can't access the whole article).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: concentration of phenol in your ointment is close to or over the ones I found in these references, and should be sufficient to exibit bacteriostatic activity if other conditions (such as pH, lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the preparation etc) are favourable.</strong> </p>

<h2>ZnO</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Zinc oxide is mildly astringent and is used topically as a soothing and protective application in eczema and slight excoriations, in wounds, and for haemorrhoids</em> (Martindale).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is used in concetrations of up to 50% (Deutscher Arzneimittel Codex – DAC), but technical literature doesn't specify a minimal concentration at which it should be used.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Perhaps I could just use more each time?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You could, but you shouldn't. Follow the instructions included in the patient information leaflet.</strong> (Using more most likely wouldn't enhance the efficacy anyway).</p>

<hr>

<p>In the end if a product is marketed as a <strong>medicine/drug</strong> in your country, it has to be submitted to rigorous procedures before it is approved, i.e. authorised for sale. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Before drug products are authorized for sale in Canada, Health Canada reviews them to assess their safety, efficacy and quality. Drug products include prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and sanitizers with disinfectant claims.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Prior to being given market authorization, a manufacturer must present substantive scientific evidence of a product's safety, efficacy and quality as required by the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have a database of products, but I suppose that you can always contact them if you have questions or concerns regarding a particular product on Canadian market. </p>

<hr>

<p>Please note that it is very difficult (if not impossible) to directly compare concentrations in in an ointment (especially a lipid-based one) and in water or aqueous medium. The ultimate burden of testing the efficacy is on the manufacturer; the ultimate burden of ensuring that such tests have been conducted and gave sufficient results in on the regulatory agency responsible for a certain market.</p>

"Are there any health benefits to male circumcision?","1017","","<p>It's been argued by various medical organizations that male circumcision has various medical benefits, such as reducing the risk of catching HIV, or reducing the risk of urinary tract infections, for instance.

","<p>There is evidence that neonatal circumcision saying that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks.</p>

<p>According to a study done on neonatal circumcision<sup>[1]</sup>, the lifetime benefits of being circumcised outweighed the risks 100 to 1. Some of the risks people may associate with circumcision are very unlikely. Excessive bleeding only happens 0.1% of the time, infections 0.02% of the time, and loss of penis 0.0001% of the time. The percentage of death is only 0.00001%. </p>

<p>Overall, it shows that males who have been circumcised require half as much medical attention as males who have not been circumcised. Also, the overall risk of circumcised men having serious medical implications is 1 to 5000; this includes things like HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. </p>

"Can ""Waterproof Swim Cap"" be good for people with ear infections?","1017","","<p>OK, I have an ear infection. The doctor says that I should not allow any water to go into my ears. However, I want to swim, but I don't want any water (even a tiny drop of water) go into my ears.</p>

<p>So, what should I do?</p>

<p>I heard there is a ""Waterproof Swim Cap"" for swimmers? See samples at <a href=""http://www.swimcapsguide.com/best-waterproof-swim-cap/"" rel=""nofollow"">this site about swimcaps</a>.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure whether it will prevent any tiny drops of water from going into my ears. I doubt that.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you're talking about otitis externa, an infection of the ear canal, a condition where you really should avoid getting any water in your ear.</p>

<p>You've already identified that the cap in question is not really waterproof. </p>

<p>The best way (and really the only way) to keep water out of your ear is to stay out of the water until your ear has had time to clear the infection.</p>

<p>To bathe, you can make a cheap waterproof ear plug by working a generous amount of petroleum jelly into a cotton ball, and using that as an earplug. You can also buy a special soft wax at most pharmacies. People roll a ball of the soft wax in their hands and press it into the outer ear. </p>

<p>Once the infection is healed, if you're not prone to such infections, you can use home-made or pharmacy bought ear drops after occasional swimming which will help maintain the proper environment to minimize infection in the ear. Use of a hair dryer on low to dry your ear is also useful.</p>

<p>High-grade silicone ear plugs can be used once the ear is healed, <em>however</em>, <em>ear plugs can aggravate or cause the condition</em>, so swimmers (or people occupationally required or recommended to wear ear plugs) usually consult with ear specialists to work out the best plug to use which will not cause damage to the ear canal, something critical for prevention.</p>

"How do they make sure someone has really died before declaring them dead?","1003","","<p>What is the way they determine someone died before declaring them dead?</p>

<p>There are stories I've heard of over the years, people who's heart stopped, were brain dead, fell under ice rivers for half an hour and miraculously survived. So there are many instances of unexplained recoveries.</p>

<p>How do the medical teams or doctors determine then that this person won't all of sudden get a heart beat back? </p>
","<p>You are correct that this happens. It is infrequent (there are not ""many"", as you say, compared to true deaths), but it occasionally happens that someone - even in a hospital - is thought to be dead when they are not actually dead. In one of your stories, the girl was presumed to be <em>brain dead</em>, not dead. So strike that one. Hypothermia is a beast all unto itself, and declaring a cold person dead is a bit tricky.*</p>

<p>Determining death is not simple. The International Guidelines for the Determination of Death – Phase I (May 30-31, 2012) Montreal Forum Report is 46 pages long and it still doesn't have a definitive conclusion.</p>

<p>For the most part (and to simplify a bit), death is determined to have occurred when someone is exceedingly unlikely (determined from experience of millions of deaths) to regain function of their heart. It can be from a very wide variety of causes, but basically it follows cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>The procedure is to observe the patient carefully. In hospital, that usually includes electronic monitors of one sort or another. Out of hospital it's by observation. When there is no evidence of cardiac electrical activity capable of generating a pulse, the patient has not been breathing for some time, oxygenation of blood has fallen to beyond critical levels, and there is no neurological activity, they are pronounced dead.**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do the medical teams or doctors determine then that this person won't all of sudden get a heart beat back? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They ""know"" because of the combined observations of millions of deaths before that one. Since it has happened, clearly it <em>might</em> happen, but once all the criteria are met, it means they are clinically dead. The exceedingly vast majority of people observed to be clinically dead are, indeed, dead (no possibility to regain function.) There's nothing else to do.</p>

<p>It is roughly estimated from the <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">WHO</a> that about 56 million people die every year. Yet it is not every day that someone who was thought to be dead is not, or it wouldn't make the news. Lets be <em>really</em> generous and say it happens once a month somewhere in the world - 12 times a year - and I think this is very, very generous (there is no known number. I'm guessing it's less in industrialized nations.) </p>

<p>That would mean a death diagnostic accuracy rate of at least 99.9999786% (55,999,988 true deaths in 56,000,000 diagnosed deaths.) That is very, very accurate. It is incredibly difficult and expensive to improve on 99.9999786% of anything for a very small return numerically speaking. It sounds harsh, but it's not. It's what society accepts, including you. If you don't believe me, try to get someone to pass a law changing that.</p>

<p>A better question might be <em>why does this happen?</em> It happens because sometimes a heartbeat is so weak as to be imperceptible to the touch, to sound, and even electronically. The person does not appear to be breathing <em>at all</em>. They have no reflexes to demonstrate neuronal activity (for example, the pupil size doesn't change on shining a light into their eyes.) In the days before burial, that doesn't change 99.9999786% of the time. But if someone's metabolic rate is low enough, they might just survive (being cold increases the chances of this*) and the heart might just start getting stronger and they might just wake up. But the odds of that are so extraordinarily low that the increased expense of storing the body, and checking it again in a more advanced state of decomposition, in addition to the increased risk of contagion... it just doesn't happen, because when someone is declared dead, they are dead 99.9999+% of the time.  </p>

<p>The whole situation is frightening to some people. But it's really an irrational fear.</p>

<p>To put the ""risk"" in more understandable terms - because the difference between life and death are pretty important - in 2013 in the US, there were 16,121 homicides. About 20% of those are stranger on stranger homicides (that is, not domestic violence, gang related, etc.). That means of 316,000,000 people in the US that year, about 3,225 people were killed by someone unknown to them, or one in 97,984. That's much higher than 12 in 56 million (which is roughly one in 4,670,000). Yet, though it's more common, you probably still leave your house most days not worrying that you'll be killed in that year. It's an acceptable risk, though death by firearm at a stranger's hand is never acceptable.</p>

<p>If this is an unacceptable risk to you (I'm not being sarcastic; it is an acceptable risk for me personally), you should stipulate in your will your wishes to be kept in storage and reexamined intermittently over a period of several days longer than usual for signs of life, and include the funds to do this.</p>

<p>*<sub>In medicine, we have a saying, ""They aren't dead until they're <em>warm and dead.</em>"" It may seem callous to a reader, but it is precisely to avoid the scenario of which you speak, because someone with a decreased temperature can survive anoxic injury better. In fact, cooling someone down who is in cardiac arrest is not uncommon, and cooling after resuscitation is common.</sub></p>

<p>**<sub>Often it is a nurse who discovers someone has died, but in many states, only a doctor, paramedic, or a coroner can declare someone dead. Nurses are often allowed to declare someone dead who is in a nursing home, hospice or a home care patient. Usually (but there is no law) we feel for pulses at various points on the body, we listen for heart sounds with a stethoscope, we listen for breath sounds, we look for chest movement, and I shine a light in the person's eyes looking for a neurological response. If after a few minutes of observation, nothing has been found, the patient is then pronounced.</sub></p>

"Effects of masturbation on Health","1002","","<p>I have heard that there can be adverse effects from masturbation, such as difficulties with having children and/or decreased sex drive.</p>

<p>Can masturbating actually decrease my fertility or sex drive? </p>
","<h2>Short Answer</h2>

<p>Masturbating does not decrease fertility or sex drive</p>

<h2>Long Answer</h2>

<p>Historically, masturbation was discouraged for a variety of reasons including the thought that it lead to mental health problems.  However, that was disproved.  The abstract of <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J056v14n02_02"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coleman, E. (2003)</a> states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research on masturbation has indicated that, contrary to traditional beliefs, masturbation has been found to be a common sexual behavior and linked to indicators of sexual health. While there are no general indicators of ill health associated with masturbation, it can be powerfully negative or positive for many individuals. As an example, it is widely used in sex therapy as a means of improving the sexual health of the individual and/or relationship. Promoting masturbation as a means of a public health strategy for sexual health is highly controversial; however, there are arguments and evidence that suggest that this may be an important part of any public health approach to improving sexual health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Masturbation was a diagnosable psychological condition until DSM II in 1968. (Ley, 2014) The American Medical Association consensually declared masturbation as normal in 1972.</p>

<p>Due to the false ideas on masturbation and mental health, there are not a lot of documented studies but I am going to concentrate on fairly recent studies to eliminate the falsehoods.</p>

<p>Another point of note mentioned in <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.05.044"" rel=""noreferrer"">Elzanaty, S. (2008)</a> is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compared with clinic-collected semen, home-collected samples had statistically significantly higher values for sperm concentration, total sperm count, rapid progressive motility, and total count of progressive motility. Semen volume, proportion of normal sperm morphology, neutral α-glucosidase, prostate-specific antigen, zinc, and fructose did not differ significantly between groups. [Therefore] results demonstrate superior semen quality in samples collected by masturbation at home compared with at a clinic. This should be taken into consideration in infertility investigations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Male Masturbation</h2>

<p>Since sperm are short-lived, they must constantly be replenished, so <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/03/100318-men-sperm-1500-stem-cells-second-male-birth-control/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the testes produce 1,500 sperm per second</a>. Plus sperm is produced during the whole of the male life. If the dead sperm is not released through sex or masturbation, it will automatically be released by the body.</p>

<p>Some males find that they are more prone to <a href=""http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/nocturnal-orgasms-and-emissions"" rel=""noreferrer"">nocturnal emissions</a> during times of less frequent sexual activity because they are not ejaculating as frequently from masturbation or sex with a partner, and in fact — as @Gabri pointed out, and studies have confirmed — high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.291.13.1578"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Leitzmann, et al., 2004)</a>.</p>

<h2>Female Masturbation</h2>

<p>There is even less around for female masturbation, but one study suggests that female orgasm induces ovulation <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.b.22690"" rel=""noreferrer"">(Pavličev, and Wagner, 2016)</a> so that would suggest that the chances of conception would be higher.  The difference between men and women is that <a href=""http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/the-female-reproductive-system"" rel=""noreferrer"">there is only a finite amount of eggs</a>.  The human female has all their eggs at birth and no more is being produced. Once they are all released, that's it.</p>

"Are there any sustainable alternatives to eating food?","1000","","<p>My metabolism is extremely high. Preparing meals/cleaning up/doing dishes would take up my entire day if I didn't eat out/order food for most of my meals. I'm wondering if there's such a thing as ""food pills"" or basically some kind of shake that I could get in bulk that I could just drink whenever I'm hungry (every 2 - 3 hours). I don't care about taste at all. Ideally, the shake/pills would have all the required nutrients and I would just take a couple minutes to consume it and then get back to working. If anyone has any ideas, I would be thrilled to hear.</p>
","<p>There's <a href=""https://www.soylent.com"">Soylent</a>, which is designed for exactly what you describe. </p>

<p>But even without considerations of taste, I'm very suspicious of this approach, because it's based on some assumptions that I would question. One is that we know exactly what the human body needs and can just put it in a shake. But what if there are micronutrients in real food that we just haven't discovered yet? Or what if the nutrient in the shake simply doesn't work when distilled into pure form, without the natural packaging provided by, say, the apple it came from. We evolved to eat food, and assuming that we can eat a processed version may be misguided.</p>

"Do carrots actually improve eyesight?","993","","<p>I've heard that carrots help improve eyesight, but the sources are pretty unreliable (TV shows, mostly). Are there any studies that prove (or show good evidence) that carrots improve eyesight? Or is this just a myth?</p>
","<p>This is debunked with little reference on <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/carrots.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Snopes</a>.  It is claimed there that the origin of the myth was deliberate misinformation to hide the use of a game-changing technology used by the RAF to shoot down German planes.  This claim regarding the propaganda origin is sourced a bit better at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cunningham_(RAF_officer)&amp;oldid=651180263#Propaganda"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on one of the officers</a>.</p>

<p>The grain-of-truth (which probably helps perpetuate the myth) is mentioned in the Snopes article as well and partially backed up at the (archived) <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20070421214532/http://www.fruitsandveggiesmatter.gov/month/carrot.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">CDC article on carrots</a> that they link to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beta-carotene, which is found in the vegetable, may help reduce the risk of cataract and macular degeneration. However, it needs be pointed out that studies which have posited this link used doses of Vitamin A or beta-carotene that were higher than what is found in the standard diet. It would be quite difficult to eat the requisite number of carrots to match this level of intake. Also, among those who suffer a Vitamin A deficiency, nyctanopia (also known as nyctalopia or night blindness; the inability to see well in poor light) can be at least somewhat helped by adding carrots to the sufferer's diet.</p>

"Does intake of processed sugar lower the immune system?","989","","<p>Growing up, my parents were very strict about sugar intake, because they had heard ""somewhere"" that eating refined sugar lowered your immune system function for 12-24 hours.</p>

<p>At the time, this seemed to be <strong>anecdotally</strong> true to me, because as a kid if I did actually eat something with a lot of sugar (candy, dessert) I would often have a sore throat or stuffy nose the next day.</p>

<p>This article from <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/10-immune-system-busters-boosters"">WebMD</a> seems to support this, but doesn't cite any references:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eating or drinking too much sugar curbs immune system cells that attack bacteria. This effect lasts for at least a few hours after downing a couple of sugary drinks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there any large studies that show this link? What is the current medical consensus on whether sugar intake makes you more susceptible to infection?</p>
","<p>There is some evidence that sugar does suppress the immune system. The <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/26/11/1180.abstract"">study that everyone seems to point to</a> was conducted in 1973, where they fed sugar in 100g doses to people and measured the effect on phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf invader bacteria to destroy it).</p>

<p>The end result was that sugar intake did appear to suppress the ability of the immune system to destroy invading bacteria. This function was suppressed for up to 5 hours in control subjects, while fasting comparisons did not have the same effect. Additionally, they counted the number of neutrophils (type of white blood cells), and they were not diminished, which suggests it was a function blocking mechanism, not that it suppressed the number. So it does limit the effectiveness, but this is not really a suppression of the system.</p>

<p>Part of this may be due to the sugar molecule being structurally similar to Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), and that it competes for the space and prevents the cells from effectively using Vitamin C to destroy bacteria. (Based off studies Linus Pauling did, but I could not find the study, merely references to it).</p>

<p>There are suggestions that sugar also <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17709452?dopt=Abstract"">may contribute to insulin resistence</a>, and that it may <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17402291?dopt=Abstract"">contribute to increased inflammation</a>, but these either state more study is needed or are in the incidence of specific other deficiencies (Such as magnesium).</p>

"Eating fast food every single day","988","","<p>Is it theoretically possible to eat fast food from McDonald's or various other fast food restaurants every single day and still maintain or even lose weight.</p>

<p>What I am saying is, if you eat fast food everyday say at lunch time and if you count your calories every day, made sure you were not going over your calorie limit by eating something small for breakfast and dinner, like oats in the morning, and getting your servings of fruit and vegetables for dinner, and get regular exercise, going to the gym, not sitting down for too much, drinking plenty of water. Will you still get fat?</p>

<p>My thinking is from what I know is weight lost is dependent on how many calories you put into yourselves and how many you burn off. So if your energy input is high and output is low, then you gain weight and vise versa for losing weight, regardless of carbs/protein/fat content, although fat contains higher energy per gram compared to carbs and protein so it is easier to go over your limit by eating fat. </p>
","<p>I have eaten McDonalds for lunch every (week) day for the past 2+ years, I can tell you it has nothing to do with weight gain or loss.</p>

<p>For the vast majority of people, losing and gaining weight is <strong>all about calories</strong>; nothing else. Genetics plays a role, but it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>There are many problems with the quality of food from McDonalds, but I will focus on answering your question within regards to weight gain/loss only.</p>

<p>The foods at McDonalds are very calorie-dense, and non-satiating. One big mac has ~563 calories... add on the large fires (~480) and large coke (~310) with that and it equals over 1300 calories.</p>

<p><strong>1300</strong>+ calories is an INSANE amount for one meal, which won't even keep you satiated (full) for very long. </p>

<p>Therefore, it's really a poor choice when it comes to weight loss.. because if you are trying to lose weight, your daily caloric intake wouldn't be too much higher than that (unless you're a bodybuilder or athlete). Some short women wouldn't even have 1300 calories total in their daily intake... that's how much calories that is.</p>

<p>That being said, if you're on some kind of diet such as intermittent fasting, and you don't eat much else other than that single meal a day.. you can still successfully lose weight even if you eat this meal each day.</p>

<p><strong>As long as the calories you consume each day is lower than your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), you will lose weight.</strong></p>

"Yearly flu and cold got worse after Mononucleosis","969","","<p>A few years ago I had Mononucleosis. Since I thought it was a bad case of flu, it went untreated. But for several months, I had flu-like symptoms (fever, very runny nose and lot of mucus) every 4 weeks. After that I was left with a permanently sore throat.</p>

<p>When I finally went to a doctor he told me the mucosa in my throat wasn't healing, he did some tests and gave me medicines.</p>

<p>I ended up discovering that I had had Mononucleosis but at the time of the exams I was already healed (I tested positive to antibodies but had no more symptoms, except for in my throat.)</p>

<p>It's been a few years since what I have described, and now my throat is healed. However, I noticed that whenever I get the flu or a cold, I feel worse than I used to feel before that case of Mononucleosis (not just on my throat though). </p>

<p>Is it possible that having contracted Mononucleosis is the cause of my worsened symptoms with colds of flu? </p>
","<p>It's possible in the same way that ""anything is possible"" (limiting ourselves to those things that are actually and potentially possible, i.e. a human can't sprout wings and fly; that's impossible.)</p>

<p>It's possible, because the etiologic agent that causes Infectious Mononucleosis - Epstein-Barr virus or EBV - may periodically reactivate; that family of viruses famously reactivates periodically, in the form of cold sores, genital herpes, shingles, etc. etc. But it was not known until relatively recently that Infectious Mononucleosis (or Mono) also periodically reactivates in some people causing symptoms consistent with a viral infection.</p>

<p>Does having had Mono make everyone's cold or flu symptoms worse? No. Does it make yours worse? Probably not, but not impossible; it's not a known scenario. Might you possibly be experiencing Mono from time to time making you feel bad? Yes, it's possible. Might having an illness reactivate your Mono? That could only be determined by testing.</p>

"What effects does alcohol have on underage children?","951","","<p>In most countries, there is a legal drinking age: 21 in the U.S., 18 in most European countries. I've always been told that legal drinking age is in place because alcohol has harmful effects on underage people. I've never been told what these harmful effects are, though. I've also questioned sometimes if this is true or not.</p>

<p><strong>Does alcohol have harmful effects on underage (say under 18) children? If so, what are the effects?</strong></p>
","<p>Alcohol is a psychoactive drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant.</p>

<p>Drinking under-age increases alcohol risks in later life. Research shows the brain keeps developing well into the twenties, during which time it continues to establish important communication connections and further refines its function and studies show that young people who drink heavily may put themselves at risk for a range of potential health problems.</p>

<p>Extreme alcohol consumption can cause memory loss, loss of coordination and <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/alcohol-poisoning/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">alcohol poisoning</a>, in some cases can be fatal.</p>

<p>Health risks associated with drinking include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>brain effects,</p>

<p>Alcohol interferes with communication between nerve cells and all other cells limiting the ability to think clearly.</p>

<p>First alcohol affects the forebrain responsible for motor coordination and decision making. Secondly it knocks out the midbrain, so you lose control over emotions and you've more chances of black outs.</p>

  allergens in the digestive tract.</p>
  
  <p>With regard to sensitisation it is still not known whether other

This would result in fewer nectar resources for pollinators and fewer weed seed resources for granivorous birds.</p>
  
  <p>Canadian farmers found that their fields filled with stray GM crop plants known as ‘volunteers’.

  <p>The potential impact of GM crops on the environment and biological diversity is the issue that has given rise to most concern and it remains in doubt<sup><a href=""http://tna.europarchive.org/20120605160537/http://www.food.gov.uk/gmdebate/?view=GM%20Microsite"" rel=""nofollow"">2003</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some other groups such as Greenpeace and WWF have concerns that risks of GM food have not been adequately identified and managed.</p>

<p>One cellular biologist, David Williams, says that anyone in this field knows that genome is not a static environment and can be transformed by several different means, and it can happen generations later which can result in potentially toxic plants slipping through testing<sup><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-genetically-modified-food/"" rel=""nofollow"">D.

<h3>Other concerns</h3>

<p>People questioning this new technology and activists around the world demonstrate to express their concerns while food industries trying to push this technology forward.</p>

<p>There are common claims from opponents that consumption of GM can cause cancer or birth defects, however there currently is no evidence to support this claim.</p>

<p>Currently labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required over 60 countries<sup><a href=""http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/27/gmo-labeling-came-pass-vermont/8166519/"" rel=""nofollow"">2014</a></sup>, the US does not require this.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Based on above, many unanswered questions remain, especially with potential long-term impact of GM foods on animal and human health and the environment and it currently. The GM foods are very complex and currently there is a lack of evidence-based research with regard to medium/long-effects on health and it remains as a matter of great public concern. Further research is required on how best to carry the experiments (modern profiling techniques and define the 'normal' compositions of conventional plants), risk assessments and surveillance studies with respect to GM crops and foods.</p>

<p>The Royal Society in their <a href=""https://royalsociety.org/~/media/royal_society_content/policy/publications/2002/9960.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">2002 report</a> saying there is at present no evidence that GM foods cause allergic reactions, use of

  <p>The review of available literature indicates that the genetically modified crops available in the market that are intended for human consumption are generally safe; their consumption is not associated with serious health problems. However, because of potential for exposure of a large segment of human population to genetically modified foods, more research is needed to ensure that the genetically modified foods are safe for human consumption.</p>

"What does ""prognostic significance"" mean exactly?","909","","<p>I am trying to more fully understand a pathologist report and do not know what ""Prognostic Significance"" means.</p>

<p>Example...</p>

<pre><code>Estrogen Receptor
Result: 80% positive
Prognostic Significance: Favorable
Reference Range: &gt; 1%
</code></pre>
","<p>Although it would be helpful if we knew what sort of pathology report this was, I surmise that it is likely describing analysis of a biopsy or surgically removed tissue specimen from a breast cancer.</p>

<p>In breast cancer, <a href=""http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/6/494"">it has long been known</a> that some but not all tumors express hormone receptors, particularly estrogen and progesterone. Although the mechanism is complicated, the basic idea is that estrogen can bind to the cells in the tumor and make it grow faster. For this reason, people with tumors expressing the estrogen receptor are often treated with <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-treating-hormone-therapy"">hormonal therapy</a> that blocks that hormonal stimulation. In pre-menopausal women, this is usually <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682414.html"">tamoxifen</a> or a related drug, which blocks the receptors directly. In post-menopausal women, a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors (<a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696018.html"">anastrozole</a>, letrozole, etc.) that block estrogen production are used. The important piece to note is that only tumors that express estrogen receptors respond to this type of hormonal treatment.</p>

<p>Partly because of the availability of these hormonal treatments, and perhaps partly due to the biology of the tumors themselves, breast cancer that expresses estrogen receptors <a href=""http://www.cihrt.nl.ca/exhibits/June%2023%20O%20Malley%20Exhibits/P-1720_Article%20entitled%20regarding%20Adjuvant%20Endocrine%20Therapy%20in%20Breast%20Cancer.PDF"">tends to have a better <em>prognosis</em> than estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.</a> <em>Prognosis</em> can refer to a variety of outcomes; in cancer studies it’s usually either survival or cancer-free survival. Patients with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer <strong>tend to fare better</strong> than those with estrogen-receptor negative tumors. Another way of stating that is: <strong>the presence of the estrogen-receptor has a <em>favorable prognostic significance.</em></strong></p>

<p>The pathology report (if I’ve got the context correct!) is saying that most (80%) of the cells in the specimen expressed the estrogen receptor. It then comments that this is known to be a favorable finding.</p>

"Leg apparently slightly shorter after femur surgery","887","","<p>In august 2016 i managed to fall off my bicycle and broke my femur bone (right greater trochanter). It was an accident and nobody else was involved.</p>

<p>Urgent surgery followed approx. 12 hours after the accident which left me with a 11x420mm Stryker titanium rod inside the right femur. More or less from the hip down to the knee.</p>

<p>Then, 2 weeks hospital care, then home recovery. This went well and i worked with a physical therapist which gradually introduced new exercises, etc. Then I moved to a normal gym which i am still doing after 7 months. I am now almost ok, climbing stairs and walking around, but there is a slight limping i am not able to get rid of.</p>

<p>Now during these 7 months there were a few intermediate checks with the doctor and his team. Two times they measured my hip-to-knee distance with a ruler and compared with the other leg, and it seemed to be ok. I didn't know what that really was about at the time.</p>

<p>Todays x-ray check showed the fracture well recovered, however the doctor finally concluded that my right leg appears shorter by 5mm. That there's nothing to be done at this point and i should keep doing recovery and possibly try wearing a foot silicone pad inside my right shoe. No more checks have been scheduled and i am free to move on with my life.</p>

<p>Now, the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it normal to expect this ""alignment margin"" in this type of surgery? any statistics that says a broken femur is likely to remain slightly off after surgery?</li>
<li>is this something i could potentially never be able to correct either via exercising or possibly other kinds of medical intervention?</li>
<li>could the difference in length be more than 5mm, and they said that to sound ""optimistic""?</li>
<li>if the difference is real (and it feels like it could be, since i am still limping a bit) and i am never able to correct it in any way, what kind of side effects should i expect?</li>
<li>should i double check with another doctor?</li>
<li>what are my options?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for any kind of insight you could provide!</p>
","<p>I am certainly no expert, however I had a hip replacement in August 2015 and I know I have a slight leg length difference now.  It's very common in hip surgery but I think we are so pleased to be out of pain it doesn't seem important until we are fully recovered as you are and then possibly left with a limp.</p>

<p>I was measured about 8 weeks after surgery and there was a difference but they said it can a couple of years for everything to 'bed in' and I think they were right except I feel that my left leg is longer than my right and some days it seems more apparent than others.  For me I think unless I start getting pain somewhere I'm not worried, I have got used to it. Saying that I did have to retrain myself to stop limping as it had become a habit. Have you had help with strengthening your core and your leg?  Once you find the right physiotherapist they are amazing.  I go to Pilates and it has made such a difference.</p>

<p>I know people who use the little insole in their shoes and they work fantastically.  A friend of mine had a really bad back and sciatica and could hardly walk but just by wearing an insole and levelling him up, he is now pain free and has been for years.   He has one pair for his shoes, another for his wellies and a third for his trainers now!</p>

<p>I would definitely go for a second opinion as it is your health and you have a right to ask questions and be in control. Sometimes we just need to speak to the right person and get peace of mind. I think it is different for everyone, some don't notice or can live with it and some people are more aware, as I am. </p>

<p>Sorry to hear you have been through so much but sounds like you have recovered really well which is fantastic.  Good luck!</p>

"Do vaccines cause autism?","883","","<p>It seems the question of vaccine harm has been around at least as long as vaccines<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_controversies"">1</a></sup>. Specifically, the claim that vaccines can cause or contribute to autism has been hotly debated in the last decade. Many claim that there is a dangerous (possibly hidden) link.</p>

<p>What is the current state of medical research on this topic? Could there be a conspiracy in the pharmaceutical industry to cover up a link?</p>
","<p>This has been a controversial dispute for a long time and it can involve a lot of personal opinion, but I will try to answer this as scientifically as possible.</p>

<p>There hasn't been any viable evidence that vaccines do cause autism. Several different theories have been proposed on why vaccines could cause autism, such as the ingredient in some vaccines thimerosal being harmful, but these have all been disproved by many different experiments.</p>

<p>Many reliable sources such as the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CDC<sup>1</sup></a> says that there is no link between autism an vaccines. A <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK190024/"" rel=""noreferrer"">2011 report<sup>2</sup></a> from the Institute of Medicine that tested 8 different vaccines on both adults and children showed that the vaccines are very safe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <a href=""http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">2013 CDC study<sup>3</sup></a> added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study looked at the number of antigens (substances in vaccines that cause the body’s immune system to produce disease-fighting antibodies) from vaccines during the first two years of life. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have ASD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CDC has also funded many other studies on vaccine ingredients and their links to autism, especially <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">thimerosal<sup>4</sup></a>, a mercury-based ingredient used in some vaccines. These studies have shown ""no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children."" </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/00_pdf/CDCStudiesonVaccinesandAutism.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Full list of CDC studies on the link between vaccines and autism<sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>These are pretty convincing, but you can't just rely on one source, right? </p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full"" rel=""noreferrer"">An issue in the Oxford Journal<sup>6</sup></a> also shows how even though there have been many claims that vaccines do cause autism, there aren't any studies that help support this claim. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A worldwide increase in the rate of autism diagnoses—likely driven by broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness—has fueled concerns that an environmental exposure like vaccines might cause autism. Theories for this putative association have centered on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines currently administered. However, both epidemiological and biological studies fail to support these claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)01239-8/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">One study that took place in the UK from 1979-1992<sup>7</sup></a> found that even though there was an increase in cases of autism, there was no jump in the amount of cases when the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, another controversial vaccine, was introduced in 1988.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/2/259.abstract?ijkey=dc1d00324fa8cd6bb885c9cb3ab0e919d0b62a53&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""noreferrer"">A 2003 study in metropolitan Atlanta<sup>8</sup></a>, Georgia compared the ages that the MMR vaccine was given in children with autism against the age that children without autism received it. The results were that the proportion of time that children were vaccinated in both control groups was similar. </p>

<p>The Oxford Journal entry mentioned many other studies that tested the link between MMR vaccines and autism and there has been no plausible evidence.</p>

<p>The other vaccine ingredient that is also said to cause autism is thimerosal, which I mentioned before. The Oxford Journal issue also shows studies about this link.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/3/604.abstract?ijkey=e453250183c05a382ba493c5ffcfbd44ed3fac79&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""noreferrer"">A study in Finland<sup>9</sup></a> helped show that there wasn't a link between thimerosal and autism. In fact, cases of autism increased in 1992 after thimerosal-containing vaccines were discontinued. </p>

<p><a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/577.abstract?ijkey=02f2f424eae1686eeaa627cd2e939a39a0bbf3b4&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""noreferrer"">Another study in the UK<sup>10</sup></a> also disproved the theory that thimerosal causes autism. They actually found that thimerosal-containing vaccines might even have a beneficial effect in children.</p>

<p>There have also been many other studies that invalidate the link between thimerosal and autism. </p>

<p>One last theory that has been proposed is that multiple vaccines being administered to a child simultaneously can weaken their immune system and cause autism. This theory is flawed for several reasons.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/109/1/124.full#sec-16"" rel=""noreferrer"">This article<sup>11</sup></a> used data from many studies and found that vaccines do not overwhelm and weaken an infant's immune system. Infants are able to respond well to the many vaccines that are given to them.</p>

<p><a href=""http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=515726"" rel=""noreferrer"">Another study<sup>12</sup></a> found that vaccines did not weaken the immune system to any diseases. They were unable to find consistent relationship between infectious diseases and immunization.</p>

<hr>

<p>All of this scientific evidence leaves one question left to be answered. </p>

<p><strong>Why do any people believe that vaccines cause autism?</strong> (this part will get some more opinion then you may like, but it is necessary)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">A 1998 study<sup>13</sup></a> was one of the main reasons that this controversy over vaccines and autism began. It claimed that the MMR vaccine caused developmental problems and other autism symptoms. This study has now been retracted as it was shown to be incorrect.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/searching-for-answers/vaccines-autism"" rel=""noreferrer"">WebMD<sup>14</sup></a> also talks about why there are still some people that believe that vaccines are the cause of autism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And when something bad happens to a child, people demand to know what or whom is to blame. ""Parents are clamoring for a cause,"" says David Tayloe, MD, a pediatrician in Greensboro, N.C., and president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).</p>
  
  <p>""It's a terrible condition. It upsets families, and it upsets me."" But all the fear and anger about vaccines is misplaced, he says. ""There's just nothing there.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems most people who claim that vaccines cause autism are just looking for something to blame for what is happening to children. Many parents may become angry when they find out their child has autism, and they put that anger against vaccines. </p>

<p>There are some logical arguments that people may present, such as changing of their child's behavior after receiving vaccines. This is mostly coincidence, as most children are vaccinated around the same time autism symptoms begin to appear (usually 12-18 months)<sup><a href=""https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/Pages/symptoms-appear.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">15</a></sup>. Other than this and some of the arguments mentioned earlier, there is almost no reason to believe that vaccines cause autism.</p>

It isn't recommended to eat and right afterwards to exercise (or swim).</p>

<p>But I haven't really understood why that is. Does this bad behavior affect me immediately (if I'm in robust health) or does it affect me in the long term? Αnd how?</p>
","<p>You have two main nervous systems when it comes to energy usage / conservation.</p>

<li><p><strong>Sympathetic</strong></p>

<p><em><sup>Tabers Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (21)</sup></em></p>

<p>When you decide to eat, the parasympatheic nervous system begins conserving energy so that more of it goes to digesting food and other bodily functions.</p>

<p>When you decide to exercise, the sympathic nervous system begins expending energy so that you can do exercise x.</p>

<p>In both of these, the other nervous system is reduced, permitting more energy to be given as needed.</p>

<p>When you both consume food and exercise the body is placed in a tricky position. It can't say no to digesting food, it will begin to rot (gas anyone?) and it needs that food to generate more energy later on. But it can't say no to exercise, that could very realistically kill you in a survival situation.</p>

<p>So it does a compromise, both will function at decreased levels.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean you can't eat food while exercising. As otherwise mentioned, marathoners do consume food. But it's unlikely they will eat complex foods like fat or protein and go straight to simple foods like carbohydrates since it is easier for the body to break it down. Despite simple foods, energy must be used to digest so it makes exercising harder. But the benefit of the energy is more quickly greater then not consuming it. Consuming too much can override this though. <sup><a href=""http://antranik.org/the-catabolism-of-fats-and-proteins-for-energy/"">1</a></sup> There aren't any long term marathoners I know of that eat a thanksgiving dinner prior and expect to make it very far.</p>

"How should ovo-lacto vegetarians compensate the lack of meat in their diets?","872","","<p>An ovo-lacto vegetarian includes both eggs and dairy products in his diet, but meat is completely excluded. In a regular non-vegetarian diet, meat is very important and provides many benefits if properly consumed.</p>

<p>I've heard of many problems that can be induced by vegetarianism, because the body stops receiving important nutrients and it's common that the diet is not changed to compensate for the lack of meat.</p>

<p>How should an ovo-lacto vegetarian compensate? The meat benefits are lost, and the body still needs them. Which changes in diet should a vegetarian perform to keep receiving the nutrients that the meat stopped providing?</p>

<p>In other words, what diet should a ovo-lacto vegetarian have to be healthy without meat?</p>
","<p>There are a few considerations when looking at a healthy lacto-ovo vegetarian diet.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Proteins</strong></p>

<p>This is fairly easy in this type of diet, as eggs contain complete proteins. There are also a few plant sources (such as quinoa, buckwheat and hempseed) that contain either a complete protein profile or the 9 essential amino acids in good amounts. Hempseed also contains Omega-3 fatty acids which can be difficult to get without seafood.</p>

<p><strong>Healthy Fats</strong></p>

<p>One of the main reasons for healthy fats in the diet is for the proper transport of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) into the body. Nuts and avocados are examples of healthy fats, as are olives and olive oils. If possible, for olive oils get extra virgin and as fresh as possible, as this will ensure the highest levels of polyphenols.</p>

<p>Along with the basic considerations, you need to be aware of possible deficiencies due to age, sex, things of this nature. For example, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15570032"" rel=""noreferrer"">this study</a> suggests that B-12 deficiency can be a problem in pregnant lacto-ovo vegetarians. High soy intake can possibly impact estrogen levels in both men and women, and possibly delay maturation/height in maturing individuals, although this is only a precaution (most of what I've read suggests further studies are needed).</p>

<p>I would talk with a nutritionist and/or doctor about the diet, and why you want to follow it. There's no reason you can't be healthy and safe about whatever diet plan you choose.</p>

"Why do pupils dilate when someone says a lie? Other physicial symptoms when someone is lying?","868","","<p>Why do pupils dilate when someone says a lie? What are other physical symptoms when someone is lying? </p>

<p>Is there a truth serum? Or is that a myth?</p>
","<p>The phenomenon you are describing of the pupils dilating when telling a lie has to do with the way the muscles around the eye are wired to the nervous system, and more specifically, the autonomic nervous system.</p>

<p>For better understanding, I suggest reading the chapter about neurotransmission in any introductory pharmacology book, such as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071764011"" rel=""nofollow"">Katzung's Basic and Clinical Pharmacology</a> (chapter 6 in 12th edition), or <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071624422"" rel=""nofollow"">Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics</a> (chapter 8 in 12th edition). However, I will try to explain it briefly here.</p>

<p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates bodily functions that occur without conscious control (involuntary actions). This system is divided into two branches: The sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system; each can be described by a short general statement, as follows: The sympathetic system is more active in a ""fight or flight"" situations, and the parasympathetic system is more active in a ""rest and digest"" state. In other words, the sympathetic nervous system adjusts your body to deal with some kind of threat to your safety, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system adjusts your body to conserve energy and be efficient when resting (i.e. good sleep,good digestion etc.)</p>

<p>Now, lying usually involves some level of tension or anxiety (unless you are a very good liar), because you might be worried to a certain degree that the lie will be revealed. This tension subconsciously triggers the sympathetic nervous system, which will cause certain effects throughout your body. Sympathetic stimulation to the eye will cause contraction of the radially oriented pupillary dilator muscle fibers in the iris and will result in mydriasis (dilation of the pupil). An opposite effect is achieved when the eye receives parasympathetic stimulation (i.e. when you are calmer, maybe after confessing the truth...), and the pupil undergoes miosis (constriction).</p>

<p>In short, since lying usually involves tension, and tension is associated with increased sympathetic activity, the pupil will dilate following sympathetic stimulation.</p>

<p>This point leads us to the other part of your question: other physical symptoms of lying are actually other manifestations of increased sympathetic activity (for a more thorough review, please see the texts I recommended above). Among others, common effects are: rise in blood pressure,increased heart rate, and increased sweating.</p>

","<p>In short, and according to <a href=""http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/about"">the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine</a>:</p>

<li><p>Lack of sleep can, in the short term, ""affect judgment, mood, ability to learn and retain information, and may increase the risk of serious accidents and injury""</p></li>

"Is fainting more common in young men during blood lettings, and if so, why?","833","","<p>I recently underwent a blood test, and during the third vial I passed out. I awoke just as the sixth was being finished and could not immediately stand. The vials were small, only 5ml each if I remember right, and the blood letting was at an NHS hospital, UK.</p>

<p>In the few minutes after this, I discussed it with the nurse, only ever having fallen unconscious once (having hit a nerve cluster in my right knee). She noted that young men tend to fall unconscious far more than another demographic, although could not recall the reason why. I professed no prior knowledge of the subject, although prodded some weak ideas about height being a factor more than gender (I am ~190cm, or 6 feet 3 inches).</p>

<p>Only one semi-satisfactory answer has been offered so far, and it's more a combination of answers than anything. Seeing as full blood donations are never done by children, data is only really available from adults, another nurse I know personally offered from her experience that more nervous patients tend to pass out more often, but that they too tend to be men. It was then theorised that since the nervousness is known to move blood away from the brain and towards muscles, this would accentuate the blood loss, causing unconsciousness. She also said young men were likely more nervous due to inexperience with any meaningful amount of blood.</p>

<p>Is this a simple, personal observation, perhaps even a white lie so as to keep a weakened patient calm, or is this backed by any statistical data? Is any reason commonly attributed to it?</p>
","<p>I found some data for blood donation, not blood testing, which of course is a higher blood loss. Also, blood tests are often done on patients who haven't had anything to eat yet, while blood donors are told to eat and drink well beforehand. So this may or may not answer your question. </p>

<p>I found two studies of interest. Unfortunately, I can only access the summary of the first one, but in this study, female donors were more likely to faint, but not significantly so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>female donors, young donors, first-time donors, low-weight donors, and donors with low predonation blood pressure had higher absolute donation reaction rates than other donors. When each variable was adjusted for other variables by regression analysis, age, weight, and donation status (first-time or repeat donor) were significant (p&lt;0.0001), and sex, predonation blood pressure, and predonation pulse were not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the second study <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943146/"" rel=""nofollow"">A single-centre study of vasovagal reaction in blood donors: Influence of age, sex, donation status, weight, total blood volume and volume of blood collected</a>, again, female  donors fainted more often and the statistical analysis came back as significant. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As depicted in the table, variables such as female gender in comparison with male [...] all showed significant association with occurrence of VVRs in healthy blood donors. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, whether they collected 350 or 450 milliliters of blood showed no significant effect. But your blood test, even at six vials, was with less than 350 milliliters. I think they usually collect less than 20 milliliters per vial. </p>

<p>In summary, at least for blood donations, it seems like there's either no significant effect, or that it's female patients who faint more often. </p>

<p>After your comment to this answer, I'd like to point out that in both studies, weight is correlated with fainting after blood loss. The second study at least only looked at total weight, the two categories being more or less than 55 kilograms, not weight in relation to height. </p>

<p>Young men, who often have just grown a lot without adding much weight, are often underweight or borderline underweight. Unfortunately, both studies weren't large enough to just look at adolescents and young adult men compared to other groups. </p>

","<p>Many patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer have their axillary lymph nodes removed.  </p>

<p>One of the main roles of the lymphatic system is to assist in draining extra-cellular fluid to the thoracic duct and ultimately back into the blood stream.  Therefore, when axillary lymph nodes are removed, there is risk of developing lymphodema (swelling) in the corresponding arm.  This puts the arm at a greater risk of infection.</p>

<p>When a blood pressure cuff is applied to the arm, the pressure of the cuff may further inhibit the drainage of the extra-cellular fluid in the arm, further enhancing the risk of the patient developing lymphodema.</p>

<p>Therefore as a precuationary measure, it is not recommended to use a blood pressure cuff on the arm of the side effected by breast cancer.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that injections are not given, and blood not taken from the affected arm.  This is because the removal of axillary lymph nodes results in a higher risk of infection in that arm.</p>

<p><strong>Brief History of Pesticide Usage</strong></p>

<p>The first recorded use of insecticides is about 4500 years ago by Sumerians who used sulphur compounds to control insects and mites, whilst about 3200 years ago the Chinese were using mercury and arsenical compounds for controlling body lice. In the 1920s there were even cases of using arsenic, which was replaced by DDT usage until the new chemical was discovered to have severe consequences (harm to <a href=""http://www.fws.gov/contaminants/Info/DDT.html"">non-target plants and animals</a> as well as problems with <a href=""http://www.idosi.org/ejas/4(2)12/2.pdf"">residues</a>). DDT is linked with cancer, endocrine disruption, and reproductive and developmental effects. Over time, people began to switch to organic pesticides to get away from the health scares (or threats) of these synthetic chemicals.</p>

<p>To address the question, we should first be clear about what organic means.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding produce:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to what most people believe, ""organic"" does not automatically mean ""pesticide-free"" or ""chemical-free"" ... it means that these pesticides, if used, must be derived from natural sources, not synthetically manufactured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Regarding Farmed Meats (some of the key requirements):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Must be raised organically on certified organic land</li>
<li>Must be fed certified organic feed</li>
<li>No antibiotics or added growth hormones are allowed*</li>
<li>Must have outdoor access</li>
</ul>

<p>Organic food covers a wide variety of techniques and different types of foods that all have their own types of legal loop-holes, or possible work-around strategies.</p>

<p>There are many pesticides that are naturally produced by plants which farmers use, but that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. In contrast, just because a pesticide is synthetic doesn't immediately indicate that it's more dangerous than natural products. Some pesticides that are approved by the government may be harmless in small quantities, but when organic producers attempt to refuse these, they may turn to alternatives that are even more dangerous, just to keep the label ""organic"".</p>

<p>In another case, farmers could claim ""natural methods are insufficient to address critical issues of production"", and then treat their animals with antibiotics while still calling the meat organic.</p>

<p>On the other side of this issue, some people argue that the less chemicals we consume in general, the better. Even if they might be government approved, that doesn't prove they're completely non-toxic.</p>

<p>The Stanford paper claim that there just isn't enough evidence to prove a significant difference in health benefits/risks. They don't necessarily have more nutrients, decrease the risk of any diseases, or have higher nutritional content except for phosphorus, which most people get enough of anyways. However, the study <em>does</em> suggest organic foods contain less pesticides. The health risks of consuming less pesticides though, <strong>are still contested</strong>. ""Additionally, organic chicken and pork appeared to reduce exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, <strong>but the clinical significance of this is also unclear</strong>.""</p>

<p><strong>Well what about taste?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taste is to a large extent subjective. Add to that
  different varieties, different weather conditions, different soil
  types and different soil management practices...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.mofga.org/Publications/MaineOrganicFarmerGardener/Summer2003/Taste/tabid/1484/Default.aspx""> - Does Organically Grown Food Taste Better?</a></p>

<p>It's nearly impossible to give a definitive answer of which tastes better. To pile onto the confusion, it's possible that the taste differences touted by some may simply derive from a <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329313000141"">""health halo""</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Genetically Modified Organisms</strong></p>

<p>In response to the scares involved with pesticides in general, people began to research methods to minimize the amount of pesticide used. Basically, DNA from an external source is inserted into a plant so that the plant inherits some desirable traits. This allowed plants to develop natural immunities to certain bacteria and produce more or bigger produce. Over time, people became scared of GMOs as too good to be true. For the most part, scientists agree that GMOs pose no greater risk than conventional food (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919210000254"">Expert evaluations from Europe found no verifiable toxic or deleterious effects from GM foods and crops</a>). There are still legitimate concerns about using GMOs, such as allergy development in humans, toxicity levels of naturally produced pesticides in the plant, and <a href=""http://civileats.com/2015/03/24/study-links-widely-used-pesticides-to-antibiotic-resistance/"">antibiotic resistance</a> of bacteria, but for the most part these are tested before distribution. Public wariness may be influenced by <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-board-directors-legally-mandating-gm-food-labels-could-%E2%80%9Cmislead-and-falsely-alarm"">labels and commercialism.</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.fao.org/organicag/oa-faq/oa-faq6/en/""><strong>Secondary Effects of Organic Farming</strong></a></p>

<p>Organic farming is good for the environment in the sense that it often leads to less pollution. Pesticides on crops often run-off into streams and rivers, interfering and even hurting local wildlife, but with organic pesticides, the chemicals decompose faster before they can cause massive change to their environment. There may be other potential benefits, but to feed the immense population that exists on earth, many debate whether organic farming is truly sustainable. </p>

<p><strong>""Healthier"" depends on the context of the food:</strong> </p>

<p>How much pesticide is being used? How much exposure becomes a detriment? Does it have long-term consequences? What are the loopholes that producers are using?</p>

<p>So when you say ""organic"" and ""conventional"" it really depends on the process, producer, and product- all of which need to be studied in more detail to develop solid claims. </p>

","<p>In medical documentation, being an X-ray, MRI, description of physical examination or other, the sides ""right"" and ""left"" are always used as they appear in your body.</p>

<p>So, the ""left neural foramen"" is on your left-hand side.</p>

<p>Below is an X-ray image of the chest cavity. You can see the letter ""L"" and all the ""left"" terms on the right side of the image, because this is a view from the front, so it is actually on the left side of the body. The confusion can occur when someone points to the image and just says ""on the left,"" which could mean either on the left side of the image or body. Anyway, when a doctor says something is on the left side, it is always on <em>your</em> left.</p>

"Why isn't Biafine sold OTC in the US?","814","","<p>I wonder why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approve Biafine for prescription only, i.e. cannot be sold OTC. Does Biafine contain any ingredients that are more harmful than other OTC drugs?  It has been OTC in France for three decades.</p>
","<p>I have two competing theories:</p>

<p>1) I guess that one problem might be that Biafine contains <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM284443.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">parabens</a>.</p>

<p>European Council recently banned some forms of parabens (<a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_107_R_0002&amp;from=EN"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>). Furthmore, in this year EC set more restrictions for the use of parabens (<a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1051_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>). It seems that parabens may have certain adverse health effects and EC think that these should be assessed before parabens are safe to use. </p>

<p>More specifically, EC claims that occlusion coat or skin irritation ""<em>may allow increased penetration than intact skin</em>"". </p>

<p>Perhaps due to the parabens the use of Biafine should be based on physician´s discretion.</p>

<p>2) Biafine was cleared by the FDA almost two decades ago (<a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/K964240.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a>). I could not find the original application in the FDA website. <a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf4/k041342.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is the FDA clearance</a> for another similar cream. In the section 5 it is stated that prescription product requires physician to diagnose the disease state. Since FDA approves many drugs based on the ""Substantially equivalent (SESE)"" (<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM284443.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a>) I think very similar process was used with Biafine. So the use of Biafine requires a visit to a physician for diagnostics. Whether this limitation is due to parabens remains unclear to me.</p>

Can I safely harvest the whole plant and eat the leaves that haven't wilted yet? Does the fungus that causes Fusarium wilt affect humans at all? Sources are preferred. </p>
","<p>What you have on your basil is a strain of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_oxysporum"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Fusarium oxysporum</em></a>, obviously a strain pathogenic to plants. </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium#In_humans"" rel=""nofollow"">Apparently</a>, other strains of <em>F. oxysporum</em> can cause <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"" rel=""nofollow"">onychomycosis</a> (nail infections) and  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal_keratitis"" rel=""nofollow"">keratomycosis</a> (corneal infections). And if you have a very low <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"" rel=""nofollow"">neutrophils</a> count, it can cause aggressive  infections throughout the entire body and bloodstream. </p>

<p>Because these are different strains, you should be fine eating the basil, I've done it and suffered no ill effects, although it can alter the flavor. The plant strain of the species would have to mutate in order to affect humans, because the food source is drastically different, and a fungus that is adapted to one source will die if introduced to the other as a food source. The metabolization process is very different.</p>

<p>In other words, be aware that there are some human pathogens in the species, but what you have isn't going to hurt you, unless you have an allergic reaction to the fungus (unlikely but possible), which I suppose you could test (by consuming a small quantity first) if you have known allergies to other fungi (such as penicillin, button mushrooms, etc).</p>

"Can being cold or wet be a significant influence in getting the common cold?","763","","<p>As most people know, it's a common thing to say something like ""better wear a sweater, otherwise I'll get the cold tomorrow.""</p>

<p>In my limited understanding, the common cold is caused by a virus. How does being cold affect this?</p>

<p>Can being cold and/or wet be a significant influence in your chances of 'catching' the common cold?</p>
","<p>This is a pretty old old-wives tale, taking many forms: don't go out into the cold while it's raining, or without a hat, with wet hair, without a warm coat or scarf, without boots, etc., ""or you'll catch your death of cold.""</p>

<p>The old wive's tale was immortalized by Jane Austin in her book, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, when the heroine's sister Jane falls ill after getting a soaking in the rain.</p>

<p>This has been studied extensively. A New York Times article describes one such uncomfortable-sounding study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1950's, Chicago researchers repeated the experiment on a larger scale with several hundred volunteers sitting in their socks and underwear in a 60-degree room before being inoculated with infectious mucus. Others, in coats, hats and gloves, spent two hours in a large freezer. The conclusion: all 253 chilled volunteers caught cold at exactly the same rate as 175 members of a warm control group. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, being cold had no effect on <em>catching</em> a cold.</p>

<p>A 1968 experiment studied the effect of (among other methods of chilling) a cold water bath at several stages during and after inoculation with rhinovirus (one of the many viruses responsible for the common cold). No effect.</p>

<p>Yet the studies continue, because anything shown to decrease the incidence of the common cold would be beneficial to the sufferers, as in the US alone, 75 to 100 million physician visits are due to the common cold, and millions of days are lost from school and work.</p>

<p>But what has never been proven is that getting chilled in any way causes one to come down with a cold.</p>

"Why should I fast before taking blood tests?","759","","<p>This always puzzled me. Not only because it is a nuisance, but also because I cannot understand it.</p>

<p>Whenever I have to take a blood sample to run some tests on it, I am always told not to eat anything for about 12 hours before the test.</p>

<p>That makes no sense to me. If they want to measure the sugar in my blood, for example, well, for sure what I eat affects that, but I'm always eating! If my blood is high on sugar when I eat my normal meals, guess what, that's how I am normally, 24/7, my whole life, so there is <strong>indeed</strong> a problem. If I fast before the test, obviously my sugar will be low, right? But it doesn't matter, because that is a forced state, that never actually happens (apart from when I'm taking blood samples).</p>

<p>Guess at the end of the test they should say ""well, you will probably be fine, as long as you take another blood test every couple of days.""</p>
","<p>Your blood sugar, as well as other blood markers, are in equilibrium most of the time. </p>

<p>A meal will create a rise in glucose, but this will only last about 2 hours, so that you will have raised glucose only 6 hours out of 24. So this is one reason why the fasting glucose is the glucose to which your body is exposed most of the time. </p>

<p>But more important, the doctors don't care for your peak glucose levels, they care for the equilibrium level of your glucose homeostasis, and that's 5 mmol or somewhere very close to it. If it is not there, then the mechanism for achieving it is broken, no matter what your postprandial glucose levels are. So both of your assumptions are incorrect. </p>

<p>And if you are on a diet which has your blood glucose levels constantly elevated, that's a very calorie dense diet and you are probably indeed in trouble. But even then, measuring your fasting glucose is important, because the doctor cannot make any conclusions from the raised levels. </p>

<p>By the way, there is also another test for blood sugar which gives you an estimation of not the current blood sugar, but of the average blood sugar over the last few weeks. Both an elevated fasting glucose and an elevated hgb 1ac levels are diagnostic criteria for diabetes, so if you somehow managed to keep your fasting glucose low but your average glucose unreasonably high, this could be discovered and you will be diagnosed with diabetes or warned that you are in a prediabetic condition, depending on the current diagnose guidelines used in your country. But if you suspect this, you should probably inform your physician, as I don't think hgb a1c is measured in routine blood tests. </p>

  <li><p>The amount of radiofrequency energy a cell phone user is exposed to depends on the technology of the phone, the distance between the
  phone’s antenna and the user, the extent and type of use, and the
  user’s distance from cell phone towers.</p></li>
  <li><p>Studies thus far have not shown a consistent link between cell phone use and cancers of the brain, nerves, or other tissues of the head or

According to the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/26/hot-dogs-bacon-and-other-processed-meats-cause-cancer-world-health-organization-declares/"" rel=""nofollow"">Washington Post</a>, WHO defines processed meats as:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>""Food poisoning"" covers a vast number of illnesses, and whether it is detectable after your recovery depends on what type of illness caused it. For example, if your gastroenteritis was caused by a norovirus (formerly called Norwalk virus, the most common cause of food poisoning), a blood test for IgM (Immunoglobulin M) to the virus, indicating a recent illness, might be positive.</p>

<p>However, diagnosing after the fact in a short term and self-limiting illness like norovirus infection is harder than diagnosis during the illness (which requires just a small stool sample), unless the pathogen is known with certainty, and even then, there may not be a residual response to test.</p>

<p>Clearly, you will be paying for a large number of tests with only a chance that one of them will come up positive.</p>

<p>In terms of getting a doctor's note, it's best if you a) have a prior relationship with the physician, b) call him while you're sick (not after) or c) see a health care provider, go to the school health clinic, a walk-in clinic, or something similar.</p>

<p>Writing a note after the fact is a tricky area ethically. Many doctors who know and trust their patients will do it without hesitation. But I can understand others simply refusing the request for a post-illness work-up (which might be negative regardless) on the basis of cost and questionable need.</p>

<p>Or to use a medical metaphor, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why"">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a>, sleep is certainly needed, that too quality sleep for certain hours. 4-5 hours seems less to me. </p>

<p>It says --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studies show that a good night's sleep improves learning. Whether you're learning math, how to play the piano, how to perfect your golf swing, or how to drive a car, sleep helps enhance your learning and problem-solving skills. Sleep also helps you pay attention, make decisions, and be creative.</p>
  
  <p>Studies also show that sleep deficiency alters activity in some parts of the brain. If you're sleep deficient, you may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling your emotions and behavior, and coping with change. Sleep deficiency also has been linked to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sleep plays an important role in your physical health. For example, sleep is involved in healing and repair of your heart and blood vessels. Ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke. </p>
  
  <p>Sleep deficiency also increases the risk of obesity. For example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/25/sleeping-six-hours-night-activity-genes"">The Guardian</a> reports that <strong><em>less than six hours</em></strong> of sleep affect the genes. And, there are many drawbacks as well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legendary short sleepers — including Bill Clinton, Madonna, and Margaret Thatcher — don't necessarily do better on fewer Zs. ""They're just not aware of how sleepy they are,"" says Thomas Roth, Ph.D., sleep researcher at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Too little sleep is bad for your health and your image: It can make you ineffective (it impairs performance, judgment, and the ability to pay attention), sick (it weakens your immune system), and overweight. In fact, women who slept five hours or less a night were a third more likely to gain 33 pounds or more over 16 years than women who slept seven hours, according to a Harvard Nurses' Health Study. Oddly, cutting too much sleep and getting less than six hours is associated with the same problems as sleeping too long: a higher risk of heart problems and death. And, of course, cheating on sleep hurts you behind the wheel: ""Wakefulness for 18 hours makes you perform almost as though you're legally drunk,"" says Walsleben.</p>

<p>[For those who believe <em>only</em> in evidences, the answer <strong>ends</strong> here]</p>

<p>[For those who believe more in traditional medicines, folk medicines and alternative medicines than researches, Ayurveda has an explanation]</p>

<h2>Ayurvedic Aspect</h2>

<p>There's something called 'satmya (saa-t-m-ya)'. In Ayurveda, it's described that if you start 'practicing' something with your body, your body 'gets adjusted' and it does not suffer the way others suffer with 'that practice'. In other words, I have been eating potatoes both the times for past 35 years <strong>AND</strong> it does not cause <em>any harm</em> to my body.

"What causes twitching eyelids? Can anything be done about them?","678","","<p>Twitching eyelids are common. The medical name for this is <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/eye-twitching/basics/causes/sym-20050838"">blepharospasm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eye twitching can come and go unpredictably for a few days, weeks or months. The spasms don't hurt, but they can be annoying. In its most common form, eye twitching is harmless and stops on its own, although it may recur occasionally. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can occur often throughout the day. The eyelid will rhythmically twitch. It will stop on it's own if nothing is done. Sometimes if it's pinched, it stops.</p>

<p>What causes this, and what can someone do to prevent it?</p>

<p>I've read this could be related to tiredness or stress. Are there other causes?</p>
","<p>""Normal"" eyelid twitching can possibly be caused or be made worse by lack of sleep, or too much caffeine or stress. That information can be found unsourced on <em>a lot</em> of websites, including with such qualifiers as ""many experts say"". I couldn't find a single source - which doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or say that these things don't cause eyelid twitches. </p>

<p>The Kellogg Eye Centre at the University of Michigan just says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cause of minor eyelid twitch is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for treatment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minor eyelid twitches require no treatment as they usually resolve spontaneously. Reducing stress, using warm soaks, correction of any refractive error, and lubrication of the eye with artificial tears may help. Some ophthalmologists recommend reducing caffeine usage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The University of Maryland Medical Center mentions, just like a lot of sources, caffeine, sleep and stress </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for treatment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eyelid twitching most often goes away without treatment. In the meantime, the following steps may help:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Get more sleep.</li>
  <li>Drink less caffeine.</li>
  <li>Lubricate your eyes with eye drops</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If twitching is severe or lasts a long time, small injections of botulinum toxin can control the spasms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, since you specifically mentioned <em>blepharospasm</em>, I am going to include some information on what's called <em>benign essential blepharospasm</em>. That's a condition that worsens with age, and often ends up including more face muscles than just the eyelids. It's probably caused at least in part by genetics, but the exact gene responsible for it remains unclear. Treatment for it includes medication, for example dopamine inhibitors, botox injections, and even surgery to remove the eyelid muscle. </p>

<p>Interestingly, for benign essential blepharospasm, drinking coffee might actually <em>delay</em> onset of the disease. </p>

"Are there any proven benefits of electric toothbrushes over manual toothbrushing?","667","","<p>Advertising has extolled the benefits of electric-powered toothbrushes for decades now, and dentists seem to prefer certain brands over others, some even selling them in their offices. In almost every home I know of (including mine), someone uses an electric toothbrush.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.dentistryiq.com/articles/gr/print/volume-2/issue-1/original-article/chronic-inflammation-an-important-factor-in-the-pathogenesis-of-oral-cancer.html"">Chronic inflammation</a> has been shown to be an important factor in the risk of oral cancer, and gingivitis is a source of chronic inflammation. But, is the incidence of gingivitis decidedly decreased with electric toothbrushes?</p>

<p>Are there really any long-term benefits associated with electric toothbrushes? </p>

<p>Please, no ""my dentist told me my oral health was much better"" anecdotes. :)</p>
","<p>There is some very good evidence that replacing a manual toothbrush with an electric toothbrush can help in reducing plaque and the risk of gingivitis. </p>

<p>The Cochrane Oral Health Group published a review<sup><a href=""http://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health"">1</a></sup> that summarized over 50 studies from 1964-2011. A majority of the studies tested the effects of a rotating oscillating electric toothbrush against a manual toothbrush. Overall, they found a 21% reduction in plaque and an 11% reduction in gingivitis. </p>

<p>There are some things that weren't found by the studies that were reviewed, mainly what the long-term dental benefits of electric toothbrushes. Also, side effects were rarely reported, so there was no sufficient evidence of whether electric toothbrushes can be harmful to your teeth. </p>

<p>A study done in 2008<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18672987"">2</a></sup> tested oscillating powered toothbrushes against manual toothbrushes over a 9 month period. It started with a 3 week period of oral care. Then some people brushed twice daily with either an oscillating powered toothbrush, a manual toothbrush, and a manual toothbrush and flood together. The powered toothbrush was able to keep the levels of plaque lower than the other two groups and also help prevent gingival bleeding. Another 2010 study<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21250772"">3</a></sup> also found very similar results in which the oscillating toothbrush help reduce plaque and prevent gum bleeding. From these studies and many others, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are better for your teeth than manual toothbrushes.</p>

<p>There is another type of electric toothbrush, sonic toothbrushes. They work by vibrating the brush head at sonic speeds. Though there are more studies done on oscillating toothbrushes, there have been a few done on the effectiveness of sonic toothbrushes. This 2015 study<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25793947"">4</a></sup> found that sonic toothbrushes were significantly better at reducing plaque than manual toothbrushes. An earlier study published in 2014<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738786"">5</a></sup> also found that sonic toothbrushes were more effective at plaque removal. They also found that for a short time (1 week), the sonic toothbrushes were better at reducing the risk of gingival inflammation. After 3 weeks though, the amount of papillary bleeding (bleeding in some parts of the mouth) were the same between those who used sonic toothbrushes and manual toothbrushes. Overall though, it seems that sonic toothbrushes are also better for your oral health than manual toothbrushes.</p>

<p>So we can see that both main types of electric toothbrushes are better than manual toothbrushes. But which is better, sonic toothbrushes or oscillating toothbrushes? In fact, a handful of studies has been done on this topic.</p>

<p>A 2013 study<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282870"">6</a></sup> tested the two types of powered toothbrushes. Both the sonic and the oscillating toothbrushes were able to significantly reduce plaque and risk of gingivitis, but the results showed the oscillating toothbrush performed better than the sonic toothbrush. Three 2014 studies<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25831599"">7</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122979"">8</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122976"">9</a></sup> agree with the conclusion that oscillating toothbrushes are better at reducing plaque and gingival bleeding than sonic toothbrushes. All of those studies were performed very similarly and had some of the same researchers between them. From these results, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are superior to sonic toothbrushes.</p>

<p>For both electric toothbrushes, we can see that risk of gingivitis and the amount of plaque on the teeth are reduced. You did ask more thing which I will answer more directly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there really any long-term benefits associated with electric toothbrushes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, from the trials I've mentioned, we can see that this is most likely the case. The longest trial I directly mentioned<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18672987"">2</a></sup> was 9 months long and it showed that 9 months of consistently using an electric toothbrush did help reduce plaque and gingival bleeding. Manual toothbrush can keep your teeth clean, but it takes more work than an electric toothbrush.</p>

<p><strong>Why doesn't everyone use an electric toothbrush if they are proven to be better?</strong></p>

<p>Well, there are a few things that come into play<sup><a href=""http://www.jeffersondentalclinics.com/blog/2014/04/30/manual-toothbrush-vs-electric-toothbrush-pros-and-cons-jefferson-dental-clinics/"">10</a></sup>. Even though electric toothbrushes are more effective at cleaning teeth and they don't take as much work as manual toothbrush, some people aren't willing to pay so much for a toothbrush. Some of the cheapest electric toothbrushes cost only $5, but the higher quality ones can go for over $100. You can get a five pack of manual toothbrushes for under $5. Another con of electric toothbrushes is that they are a hassle. They are bigger, and they require batteries or they have to be charged. Some people just don't want to deal with that. Lastly, electric toothbrushes can be easily broken. If you drop it, that might be it and you just lost $10. Now, electric toothbrushes are becoming more popular, but some of these cons are still holding people back.</p>

"Is there evidence that lowering blood pressure via medication is decreasing mortality?","642","","<p>Higher than average blood pressure is likely associated with higher mortality, but is there any study that showed that lowering it with medication is beneficial?</p>
","<p>Yes, mortality benefits for blood pressure medicine have been demonstrated in trials.</p>

<p>Let me just preface this by saying this was much harder to find than I was expecting. Questioning the benefit of blood pressure reduction is medical heresy, so you'd think you wouldn't have trouble finding the data out there.</p>

<p>First of all, let's define the question. We're asking whether treatment of hypertension leads to lower mortality in the setting of a randomized clinical trial. Reading between the lines, I think what we really want to know is whether treatment of isolated hypertension (i.e. in patients that have no strokes, heart failure or other diseases associated with hypertension) leads to lower mortality in a randomized clinical trial. Treating hypertension after a stroke or heart attack is hands down beneficial (see HOPE, PART2, IDNT, NICOLE or PREVENT trials [1-5]). You can't answer the question with this data though, because maybe the drug is really just treating the heart attack or stroke. </p>

<p>To get data specifically on treating hypertension itself, not in the setting of other medical problems, you have to go back to the 1960s. The VA COOP Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents [6,7] trial specifically looked at treating people who just came into the clinic with high blood pressure. Mortality was 5% lower in the treatment group, or, for every 20 people treated for 3.3 years (the average time people were enrolled in the study), 1 person will have their life saved. Honestly, this is a pretty good outcome as far as drugs go, taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks doesn't work nearly as well, for example. The authors collected these numbers on mortality but they didn't test for whether the numbers were likely to have just popped up by chance or not (statistical significance). I crunched them myself with Fisher's exact test and the results were unlikely to have just come up by chance (p value = 0.015) </p>

<p>Some caveats. This study was old (the word negro is used), but it was really well done. They had the patients go through a 2 month run in phase where they had to take pills that turned their urine orange just so they could see whether they took their pills regularly before letting them in the trial. All the patients and the doctors were blinded. They used sealed envelope randomization. Patients were enrolled from eight different sites. Of course, it was done at the VA in the 60s, so every single patient was a man. Also, the patients weren't exactly free of other diseases. For some reason, the authors didn't just say how many patients had strokes or heart attacks in the past. They devised this ""severity score"" to assess how many health problems people had at the start of the trial. The score went from 0-4 and on average the patients were less than 1. I would say most weren't very sick.</p>

<p>Some other trials tried to test blood pressure medicines versus placebo but fell short. The Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension [8] had many fewer events than the VA study so weren't quite able to show statistical significance. The benefits to treatment that they measured in this study were way smaller. Treatment reduced death by .15%. So for every 666 people taking the drug for 1 year, 1 person's life would be saved. They were only able to show this was statistically significant when they looked at the numbers for people actually taking the drug. You want to look at everyone that entered the study in the first place though (intention to treat), because you can always invent scenarios where you get biased results if you don't do this. </p>

<p>There was one other study that looked at this question. The Oslo study [9] also failed to show that treatment actually saved lives when treating patients with just hypertension.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that all of these studies were able to show benefit to treating (fewer strokes, less kidney failure) but mortality was really only lower in the VA trial. My gut tells me that this was because aged American veterans were less healthy to start with then relatively healthy Norwegians and Australians (the population from the other studies). It was less of a needle-in-a-haystack challenge in the VA trial.</p>

<p>Sometime in the 70s or 80s, it seems that doctors all decided that treating hypertension was the way to go no matter how healthy the patient was otherwise so we don't have any more studies. </p>

"Why do people get nosebleeds from overexerting themselves or when they're sick?","638","","<p>In many TV shows from medically-related to not, people get nosebleeds when they're working too hard or ""deathly"" ill. I'm wondering if this real or just dramatized. If it happens to be real, is it only for physical activity and health or possibly from mentally strenuous activity too?</p>

<p>Ultimately, how does the nosebleed typically occur?</p>
","<p>Blood vessels do pop or rupture at times, causing a nosebleed. </p>

<p>So what exactly in the sick and stressed cause them to have more nosebleeds?</p>

<p>Now with regards to stress, there is debate <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1120295/"" rel=""nofollow"">(2)</a>. A study published in 1977 found no correlation <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/339142"" rel=""nofollow"">(3)</a>, but a more recent study in 2012 <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22694985"" rel=""nofollow"">(4)</a> suggests that high blood pressure is associated with nosebleeds. If this is the case, <strong>researchers theorize that since high levels of stress cause high blood pressure and constrict blood vessels <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Stress-and-Blood-Pressure_UCM_301883_Article.jsp#.VrAi_XSxalx"" rel=""nofollow"">(5)</a>, then it is possible for stress to cause these vessels in our nose to rupture.</strong></p>

","<p>You are right that there are conflicting viewpoints about whether or not Vaseline and other types of petroleum jelly, also known as petrolatum, are comedogenic (can cause or worsen acne). There are medical professionals who will say that petroleum jelly will cause acne, while others might argue the opposite. The same also goes for research, though most research points to petroleum jelly being non-comedogenic. </p>

<p>Why might petroleum jelly be comedogenic? Petroleum jelly is very greasy. This greasiness could cause petroleum jelly to be comedogenic. Research has also shown this may be the case, but there is also some more reliable research that suggests that this is false. Because people have wondered if petroleum jelly is comedogenic for a long time, most studies on this topic are a little bit older (pre-2000). Also, most studies that suggest the petroleum jelly might cause acne were done on rabbits, who are much more sensitive to cosmetics than humans are. </p>

<p>A 1972 article that introduced acne cosmetica,<sup><a href=""http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=532944"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup> acne caused by cosmetic products, tested many different cosmetic creams on rabbit ear canals, and found that many of them, including petroleum jelly, were mildly comedogenic. The research also found that using petroleum jelly or other cosmetic substances can cause mild acne breakouts in some woman. This research wasn't extremely convincing that petroleum jelly is comedogenic as rabbits aren't the perfect model for seeing what the effect would be on human skin. Also, the research done on petroleum jelly's effect on actual human skin showed that it caused comedonal reactions, but only in some women.</p>

<p>The most reliable study testing if petroleum jelly is comedogenic is probably a 1996 study by the same man who did the previous study I mentioned.<sup><a href=""http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1996/cc047n01/p00041-p00048.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></sup> The results, after testing different products that use petroleum jelly on different groups of patients, were that there wasn't any comedogenic potential in petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly also didn't worsen acne at all.</p>

<p>It is most likely that petroleum jelly is not comedogenic. Some studies point to it being comedogenic as a possibility, but rabbit ears are much more sensitive than human skin, so it is impossible to get definitive information from those studies. If you are worried about getting acne from using a product like Vaseline, you should be fine. Odds are, the Vaseline would be helping you more than hurting.</p>

","<p>Headaches in general are quite poorly understood, and there are a number of different types of headaches, with a very large number of conditions known to cause them.<sup>1</sup> A common denominator though seems to be blood flow,<sup>2</sup> which makes sense considering the importance of keeping the brain properly oxygenated. Too little blood to the head and you can lose consciousness (which evolutionarily is very bad, because an unconscious monkey can't defend itself or its kin). Too much blood and you risk improper brain function in the best case, and hemorrhaging into the delicate brain tissues in the worst. For this reason and others, blood vessels in and leading into the head are often covered in nerves. Major changes in blood flow putting pressure on these nerves can cause headaches.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Glyceryl trinitrate patches work so well for angina because nitroglycerin is converted in the body to nitric oxide, one of the body's own primary vasodilators, and vasodilators serve the role of causing blood vessels to widen.<sup>3</sup> In the chest, this widening helps the heart to function. In the head — which the nitroglycerin eventually reaches as it is systemically absorbed — vasodilation allows blood vessels to hit these nerves, and there's your headache.</p>

"Effects caused by staying near the mobile network towers","593","","<p>What are the possible consequences and health problems that a person staying very close to mobile signal towers could be subjected to.</p>

<p>I have heard that the people who stay very close these towers will be subjected to a huge amount of radiation. </p>

<p>What are the harmful effects or problems a person staying in such places will could have?</p>
","<p>Many countries have done studies that seem to indicate short-term exposure to the radiation does not increase risk of cancer.</p>

<p>However, some countries are still uncertain about this, and have requested companies move their towers away from people by at least 100 meters.</p>

<p>An Italian court even acknowledged a ""causal"" link:
<a href=""http://www.prlog.org/12004383-italian-supreme-court-rules-cell-phones-can-cause-cancer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prlog.org/12004383-italian-supreme-court-rules-cell-phones-can-cause-cancer.html</a>
but this has been deeply criticized by public health leaders in places like the US.</p>

<p>For the most part, there hasn't been substantial evidence to say that the towers cause harm to humans more than 100 meters away. Particularly in the case of short-distance exposure, there hasn't been much data because many times base stations are not turned off during maintenance, but the power being sent through to the antennas is cut off, so that the workers do not have to work near live antennas, but a study over around 50 years of people exposed to Radio Frequency (RF) waves indicates no significant negative consequences. In the conclusion the author notes a well-worded disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The controversy about cell phones and cancer is likely to
  continue either until clear-cut evidence of a hazard is established or
  until the public (including politicians, businessmen, lawyers and
  journalists) concludes that there is little likelihood of a real and
  significant hazard. Perhaps the greatest contribution that scientists
  can make to this debate is to help educate the public (and other
  scientists) about the uncertain nature of risk assessment, and about the
  breadth of disciplines and rigor of analysis that must be brought to
  bear if high-quality risk assessment is to be accomplished.</p>

<p>but when we're talking about these levels of radiation, you would have to be extremely close for an extended period of time, which is why we haven't yet found results in humans. For the most part, we don't stay close enough to have measurable results and those who do take precautions and avoid long-term exposure.</p>

"What is the process for removing moles (cancerous or non-cancerous) from skin?","593","","<p>Moles are underneath or in the deeper parts of the skin I believe. Do they use lasers or something? How do they prevent or try to prevent scarring?</p>
","<p>There are actually a few ways that moles are removed. </p>

<h3>Cutting it off</h3>

<p>Sometimes moles can be ""shaved"" off if the cells don't go very deep. Other times, the mole cells will be deeper in your skin, so the doctor will have to make a deeper cut to prevent it from coming back (like taking a weed out by its roots). The deeper cuts will usually require stitches. This process is called 'excision'.</p>

<p>In cases where the mole is suspected to be cancerous, this is always the method used - usually a full excision is performed to make sure no potentially-cancerous cells are left behind.</p>

<h3>Freezing it off with liquid nitrogen</h3>

<p>A small amount of liquid nitrogen (which is extremely cold) will be placed on the mole. A small blister might form, but it will heal by itself.</p>

<h3>Burning it off</h3>

<p>An electric current is passed through a wire which will burn off the upper layers of the skin (where the mole is) off. Can require multiple treatments.</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure if I'm doing it right because sometimes my gums bleed. If I floss the right way, should it never bleed?</p>

<p>Initially, flossing will cause inflammation and minor bleeding however, if the bleeding is rather severe it could indicate a periodontal disease and require medical intervention. Gums, if they are ""virgins"" to interdental flossing scene, will be <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2379.aspx?CategoryID=74"">tender</a>, and this is common amongst nearly all whom who haven't flossed. So, despite your concern, they will become more firm once the plaque has been plausibly removed. As your gums become less tender, they will hence become less sensitive and no longer bleed as you floss. </p>

He claims that it simply takes him that long - he's not staring at his phone or reading a magazine or somesuch. He seems convinced that there's nothing out of the ordinary. Yet he regularly takes 30-45 minutes in the bathroom at a time.</p>

","<p>You didn't say which country you work in, so let's take the US as an example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Do I have a right to have my medical information kept private in the workplace?</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Your employer has a number of ways to obtain medical information about you, whether it's because you volunteer it when you call in sick or tell co-workers, or because you provide requested information on health insurance application or workers compensation claim forms. <strong>However, just because your employer has the information does not mean that it should be shared with everyone in the workplace, especially when you have not chosen to do so.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The basic legal principle that employers should follow is not to reveal medical information about you unless there is a legitimate business reason to do so. But because that standard is fairly vague, there are laws which more specifically protect the privacy of your medical records, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the law which makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of an employee's disability. State laws may also provide additional protection.</p>

<p>Hence, the bottom line is that it is utterly irrelevant whether your coworker does or does not have an underlying medical condition that you don't know about, because people have the right to health information privacy worldwide. In other words: <strong>your coworker's potential medical condition is none of your business</strong>.</p>

<p>The right to privacy has been around for a while and as such should be understandable to any civilized human being. To be consistent with meeting health SE's reference requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Privacy addresses the question of who has access to personal information and under what conditions. [...]</p>
  
  <p>There are a variety of reasons for placing a high value on protecting the privacy, confidentiality, and security of health information (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). Some theorists depict privacy as a basic human good or right with intrinsic value (Fried, 1968; Moore, 2005; NRC, 2007a; Terry and Francis, 2007). They see privacy as being objectively valuable in itself, as an essential component of human well-being. They believe that respecting privacy (and autonomy) is a form of recognition of the attributes that give humans their moral uniqueness.</p>
  
  <p>The more common view is that privacy is valuable because it facilitates or promotes other fundamental values, including ideals of personhood (Bloustein, 1967; Gavison, 1980; Post, 2001; Solove, 2006; Taylor, 1989; Westin, 1966) such as:</p>

Although the body's maximal store of vitamin C is largely determined by the renal threshold for blood.</p>

<p>However if you exceed the upper limits of your body/bowel tolerance, in general any drug overdose is dangerous causing some side effects. Relatively large doses of ascorbic acid may cause indigestion, particularly when taken on an empty stomach and it can case diarrhoea. In one trial in 1936 (6g doses) toxic manifestations were observed in 5/29 adults and 4/93. Symptoms of Vitamin C overdose could include: skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, facial flushing, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. As well as itchy skin (prurutis), dizziness and abdominal pain.</p>

<p>It's usually advised to take smaller doses more frequently (e.g. ever hour), than larger doses in short amount of time in order to simulate endogenous production and increase your tolerance threshold. On the other hand your body would ""learn"" daily intake and it will expect similar doses on daily basis.</p>

"Baking Soda & Hydrogen Peroxide washes effective home remedies for yeast infections? Safe?","577","","<p>I have a low immune system so I'm prone to a lot of yeast infections. What are some some DIY/home remedies for treating yeast infections? I know that yogurt is pretty effective, and I've heard that garlic, basil leaves, and cranberries are as well -- in addition to keeping it try and cool (applying cool compressing and not wearing restrictive clothing).</p>

<p><strong>But what about baking soda or hydrogen peroxide washes in the infected area, e.g. vagina? Are these effective?</strong> I've heard mixed reviews and am not sure whether or not it will irritate it and make it worse? Would the hydrogen peroxide sting? </p>
","<p>One systematic review (1) conducted in 2003 examined the efficacy of several complementary and alternative therapies (including douching with sodium bicarbonate) for yeast vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis</p>

<p>Here an extract of their abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inconsistencies in definition of vaginitis, type of intervention,
  control groups, and outcomes prevented performance of a meta-analysis,
  and <strong>paucity of high-quality studies</strong> made ranking by evidence-based
  scales unsuitable. <strong>Lactobacillus recolonization (via yogurt or
  capsules) shows promise for the treatment of both yeast vaginitis and
  bacterial vaginosis with little potential for harm.</strong> Boric acid can be
  recommended to women with recurrent vulvovaginal Candidal infections
  who are resistant to conventional therapies, but can occasionally
  cause vaginal burning. <strong>Because of associated risks in the absence of
  well-documented clinical benefits, douching remains a practice that
  should not be recommended for the treatment of vaginitis. Finally, tea
  tree oil and garlic show some in vitro potential for the treatment of
  vaginitis, but the lack of in vivo studies preclude their
  recommendation to patients for the time-being.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second (2) was conducted in 2009 and examined the efficacy of <strong>probiotics (incl lactobacilli)</strong> for the prevention or treatment of three major urogenital infections: bacterial vaginosis,  vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract infection.</p>

<p>Here the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, lactobacilli were beneficial for the treatment of patients
  with bacterial vaginosis. <strong>No clear benefit was seen for candidiasis or
  urinary tract infection.</strong> Studies were heterogeneous, with some limited
  by a small population size. In conclusion, the use of certain
  lactobacillus strains such as L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri for
  prevention and treatment of recurrent urogenital infection is
  promising, especially for recurrent bacterial vaginosis</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>So to summarise, data suggests that probiotics (yoghurts with lacotbacillus) might be useful but larger studies are needed. Concerning douching with baking soda (ie sodium bicarbonate) or the use of hydroxide peroxide, evidence is sparse and their use is currently not recommended.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here the summary of recommendations on UpToDate (a resource for health professionals)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>There is no evidence from randomized trials that garlic, tea tree

"Why would a junkie have a grand mal seizure during withdrawal?","577","","<p>On the television show <em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>, one of the main characters is a heroin addict. After a couple of days without heroin, he goes into intense withdrawal, and either has a grand mal seizure or pretends to.  His family is used to his addiction, and when his mother returns home from an errand, his sister says, rather matter-of-factly, ""He went grand mal"".  </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.addictionsandrecovery.org/withdrawal.htm"">this</a> website, heroin withdrawal alone doesn't cause seizures: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heroin withdrawal on its own does not produce seizures, heart attacks, strokes, or delirium tremens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why would a person in this situation have a seizure?  Is it more likely to be the result of his sudden withdrawal (contradicting the quote above), or is it more likely to be a side effect of the use of heroin itself, or is it more likely that he has a medical condition that causes seizures, but which is totally unrelated to his addiction?</p>
","<p>It's not really medically accurate, unless there are other drugs of abuse present, or some other disease etiology. The quote that you reference is correct, heroin addiction by itself <em>shouldn't</em> produce seizures as part of withdrawal symptoms. However, there can be other drugs present (Such as alcohol, which can definitely produce seizures during withdrawal) which could complicate the matter.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the person is a long time heroin abuser, then withdrawal symptoms would most likely start much sooner than a couple of days, possibly even within hours of their last dose wearing off.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_addiction_and_dependence"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia site</a> for opioid addiction gives a pretty detailed rundown of opiate addiction and other factors that can enhance or show predisposition to addiction. There are many other sites (Most of them rehabilitation facilities) that give fairly detailed rundowns of the withdrawal process and symptoms that can occur during that time.</p>

"In childbirth, can one twin's arm stick out of the womb and then the other child is born first?","575","","<p>There is a story of a birth of twins from <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2038:27-30"">Genesis 38:27-30</a> with some details that raise some medical questions. Among them:</p>

<p>It is implied that before birth, they knew the mother had twins.
The first thing to come out of the womb was one baby's arm (upon which the first thing the midwife does is tie a crimson thread to it).
The arm goes back into the womb.
The other baby is birthed, followed by the one with the thread.</p>

<p>Without using modern medical technology, are any of those things medically impossible or are they just uncommon?</p>
","<p><em>""When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, “This one came out first.” But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez.  Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah.""</em> - Genesis 38: 27-30</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is implied that before birth, they knew the mother had twins. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any good midwife can determine when a woman is carrying twins. The uterus will be bigger, and there will be excess everything: excess heads, excess rumps, excess backbones (these are things that can actually be felt and located on manual examination). Late in the pregnancy, if both twins are head down (the usual and most common presentation), there will be two rumps up top.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first thing to come out of the womb was one baby's arm... The arm goes back into the womb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my medical experience delivering babies (I've delivered a significant number), this is fairly unlikely <em>if the story is told without including pauses</em>. For one thing, the waters would have had to have broken - at least one sac if they were dichorionic diamniotic twins, which is most common for non-identical twins (which they were). This usually occurs very close to the time of birth, when the pelvis would be already occupied by a head. There's not a lot of room for hands and arms to be swinging freely in there. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tgBQd.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first thing to come out of the womb was one baby's arm (upon which the first thing the midwife does is tie a crimson thread to it).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, <strong>compound presentations</strong> may occur in a ""roomy"" pelvis, and are more likely to occur when the pelvis is not fully occupied by the fetus because of low birth weight, <strong>multiple gestation</strong>, polyhydramnios, or a large pelvis. They occur in singleton pregnancies about once in ~1500 births, and usually, the ""misplaced"" part is a hand or arm. <strong>In general, if left unattended, the <em>hand will retract</em> or <em>the arm will extend further</em> as labor progresses.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...unborn children have all their reflexes in utero, [therefore] unborn babies are fully capable, within the limitations of the space available, of reacting as they would as newborns. The simplest approach, therefore, may be to apply a benign noxious stimulus, such as a gentle pinch to a fingertip of the advancing hand. By applying a benign noxious stimulus (between contractions, of course), the hand may withdraw and never appear in the undesired position again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Genesis, note that the hand alone came out, and since it usually retracts, this is possible. The tying of thread around the infant's arm might be enough noxious stimuli to cause it to retract.</p>

<p>As I said, with twins there's less room, however</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rupture of membranes when the presenting part is still high also increases the risk of compound presentation, cord prolapse, or both... In multiple gestations, a possible scenario involves the head of the first twin and an extremity of the second twin within the birth canal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which would be the exact scenario described in Genesis.</p>

"Time intervals between blood donations","568","","<p>What interval should blood donors wait between donations, and what are the risks involved in donating with shorter intervals than recommended? </p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486820/"" rel=""nofollow"">The only known significant long-term risk of blood donation is iron deficiency.</a> Immunity (which you asked about) is primarily mediated by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">white blood cells</a>, which can be easily deployed from the lymphatic system and bone marrow to replace those lost in donation. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">Red blood cells</a>, on other hand, are not stored as mature cells in large numbers outside of the bloodstream. They also contain hemoglobin, which requires iron for its production. The body has a limited supply of iron, and when red blood cells are removed via blood donation, this can be depleted. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486820/#__sec4title"" rel=""nofollow"">Approximately 200 - 230 mg of iron is lost during a standard blood donation</a> (~450 mL whole blood). It has been shown that <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15383019"" rel=""nofollow"">short-term iron supplementation is effective in replacing iron loss</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing"" rel=""nofollow"">American Red Cross recommends</a> donors wait 8 weeks between transfusions. <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-donation/pages/introduction.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">The NHS guideline</a> is more conservative, recommending 12 weeks for men and 16 weeks for women. The difference between the sexes in that recommendation is because women lose blood regularly through menstruation and thus tend to have lower stores of iron and can easily become anemic. The threshold hemoglobin level required for donation is also different between the US and Europe: 12.5 g/dL for both sexes in the US; 12.5 g/dL for women but 13.5 g/dL for men in the Europe.* </p>

<p>The <em>optimal</em> interval for blood donation remains a bit of an open question. (Note that for women, the NHS recommendation is twice as long as the Red Cross’s recommendation!) To investigate that, there was recently <a href=""http://www.intervalstudy.org.uk/about-the-study/"" rel=""nofollow"">a large trial conducted within NHS</a> centers that randomized men to 12-week, 10-week, or 8-week intervals between donation while women were randomized to 16-week versus 14-week versus 12-week intervals.<sup>2</sup> They will report hemoglobin levels in donors, including the number of donations that have to be deferred due to hemoglobin levels below the recommended levels (NHS guidelines above). <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177700/"" rel=""nofollow"">The full methodology is available online</a>, but to my knowledge the results have not yet been published.   </p>

"What is the function of goosebumps in human anatomy? It happens when it's cold, scary, or euphoric, but WHY?","550","","<p>We've all experienced it when we hear a chilling tale that scares us or we get out of the pool and there is a crisp breeze or simply something unbelievably emotionally positive is occurring (a sense of euphoria): goosebumps. But WHY? <strong>What purpose do goosebumps serve in the human anatomy?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Why do the hairs on our arms, neck, spine, etc stand up when these things happen? Is there some primal human benefit that no longer benefits us (or still does and I'm unaware of it)?</strong></p>

<p>Do other animals experience this? </p>
","<p>Getting goose bumps is a reflex, which is an action your body has automatically without you even thinking about it. This particular reflex is known as the pilomotor reflex. Humans aren't the only mammals that have this reaction.</p>

<p>Function of Goosebumps</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As for animals, the pilomotor reflex in them often has the effect of making an animal look bigger. This might help to scare away potential enemies that may have caused the fear reaction in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Goosebumps experienced in times of cold is the body's way of preserving its own heat by causing the hairs on the skin to stand up, thus reducing heat loss.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why do the hairs stand up</p>

<p>When you get cold or experience a strong emotion, your brain sends signals to your muscles that make them tense up. When the muscles in your skin that are attached to hairs do this, they make the hairs stand up and pull your skin up just a bit, creating goose bumps.</p>

<p>Is there some primal benefit that no longer benefits us?</p>

<p>The formation of goose bumps in humans under stress is considered by some to be a vestigial reflex; some [who?] believe its function in human ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger to scare off predators.</p>

<p>Do other animals experience this?</p>

<p>Yes, animals too experience goosebumps. For example, when porcupines are threatened, their quills raise in a reflex action. Similarly, you may have seen a cat's or a dog's hairs stand on end when they sense danger or feel afraid.</p>

"Advantages of transition from non-vegetarian to vegetarian","539","","<p>Influenced by PETA, a lot of people have already changed to vegan status. I would like to know how well the transition may work? It can be either in a physical or mental way.</p>

<p>Some have changed for religious views, some for humanitarian reasons. But I would like to know the health beneficial aspects.</p>
","<p>This is a question that cannot be answered by a simple yes or no.</p>

<p>As a vegetarian for health purposes (who was a vegan for 1 year) I say that the human isn't supposed to be vegetarian, but rather an opportunistic omnivore. The fact that we can eat meat doesn't mean we have to.</p>

<p>Most of people that went from non-vegetarian to vegetarian (no meat, no fish) felt better the following weeks, however the reasons could be numerous and ambiguous:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe they were eating <strong>too much</strong> meat until they stopped ?</li>
<li>Maybe the meat they were buying was bad quality meat ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, most of meat and fish's nutrients we need to live healthy are proven to be in eggs and milk with enough quantities.</p>

<p>Concerning the vegans (no eggs, no milk), the most recurrent problem is about the vitamin B12 that is very hardly obtained in vegan food, it can be found in some mushrooms, but in most cases you'll have to eat 4kg of that a day to fulfill your daily needs. It can also be found in some algaes and supplements like spirulina, but in that form it is nearly impossible for the body to be absorbed. Even though you might feel better the first year of veganism, you might be sick later on, even though some vegans never become sick.</p>

<p>It also depends of the genes of each person. Some African ethnicities have evolved eating a lot of meat per day and still they remain healthier than most of people from Western countries. On the other hand, most Romans from the antiquity were eating less than 1kg of meat per month.</p>

<p>I think that the best way to find how being vegetarian is good for you is to try it out by yourself, pay attention at how you feel, and have regular blood tests.</p>

<p>There was a study in 2000 that was published in the <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/72/3/694.long"" rel=""noreferrer"">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a> that attempted to lay some groundwork for this kind of evaluation, and they came up with some interesting formulae for body fat assessment, but it was left as very open ended and needing much more study.</p>

<p>There is a chart available through the American Council on Exercise (ACE) that shows levels of fat for various categories of men and women, but it makes no distinction on age, merely on activity level.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MSjAr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Another pair of charts from Accufitness (Makers of body fat calipers) I like better, as it accounts for both age and sex, but makes no allowances for activity level.</p>

<p>If you look at BMI charts, anything below 18.5 is considered unhealthy, and anything over 25-30 (depending on chart) is trending towards the obese range. These are more statistical/actuarial tables than anything, however and have been around (largely unchanged) since inception in the early/mid 1800's.</p>

<p>As far as the measurement, there are three different types of fat, subcutaneous (under the skin), visceral (Around body organs) and intramuscular (In the muscles, like marbling on a steak). Bioelectric impedance (Such as the scale you mention) work by passing a low electric current through the body and measuring the resistance. These can have a +/- accuracy range of 3-10% depending on the model, and can be affected by hydration, time of day, wet skin, and other factors.</p>

<p>Skin calipers done by an experienced practitioner can have a variance as low as 3%, underwater weighing (Again done properly) can get below 3%, and the gold standard is a DXA scan that measures everything from bone density to total fat.</p>

<p>So far everyone agrees that too low or too high a weight is bad and carries risk of injury/illness/disease, but we haven't agreed yet on what is good for which population cohort.</p>

"Drawbacks of sitting with one leg on a chair","531","","<p>When sitting one the ground I always sit on my knees (<a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza"" rel=""nofollow"">Seiza</a>), because when I try to sit on my buttocks I tend to lie down, and it's just very exhausting for me to sit this way.</p>

<p>So when I sit on a chair, I'm guilty of heavy slouching when I sit on my ass. When I let go, or don't concentrate on it, sometimes my back touches the lower part of the chair, because I just slouch so heavily.
I don't have back problems, because I'm very careful when I crouch or lift heavy objects, but when I sit, I don't want to concentrate on sitting, but rather on my work.</p>

<p>One solution for me was to sit on one leg on the chair and have the other one either hanging or sort of pursed in to the chair.
I can feel that my back is straight when I sit this way, but I always wonder if I commit some atrocity to my legs (esp. knees) whenever I do this.</p>

<p>So are there some health drawbacks to sitting this way? (Also I don't really know how to tag this...)</p>
","<p>Drawbacks of the way you are sitting are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Confine your legs to one position, which can increase pressures under the knee cap and slow circulation to the legs.</li>
<li>Prevent you from using your feet to scoot around and navigate your work area.</li>
<li>Be tricky to get in and out of.</li>
</ol>

<p>so, I would recommend you try change your habit of sitting, maybe difficult but it's good for both your health  and your work.</p>

"Is olive leaf extract dangerous for low blood pressure?","528","","<p>I am 84 years old, with heart failure, diagnosed about 10 months ago, now successfully treated, and my naturally low blood pressure is kept at, or reduced to, a satisfactorily low level. I would not want to reduce it any further. With all other tests OK, I am being signed off from the clinic and expect to continue to live a normal, but careful, life. </p>

<p>My question is: Olive Leaf Extract is said to lower blood pressure, so does that make it dangerous for patients with heart failure and low blood pressure to take for its other benefits? Can it lower blood pressure below physiological boundaries?</p>
","<p>First, I should say that I think this question should be closed. It's clearly a request for personal medical advice, but apparently no one else shares that view, so I'll go ahead and answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would not want to reduce it any further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then taking a supplement known to lower blood pressure would seem like a bad idea.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21036583"">This study</a> compared the effects of olive leaf extract on BP to an ACE inhibitor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, Olive (Olea europaea) leaf extract, at the dosage
  regimen of 500 mg twice daily, was similarly effective in lowering
  systolic and diastolic blood pressures in subjects with stage-1
  hypertension as Captopril, given at its effective dose of 12.5-25 mg
  twice daily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So olive leaf extract seems to be pretty effective stuff, almost as effective as an ACE inhibitor. Therefore, taking it without first involving the medical professionals you've been seeing up until now probably isn't a good idea.</p>

"How do antihistamines work?","524","","<p>We recently got some new kittens and my step son is allergic to them. He mostly suffers from a runny nose, but also had itchy eye last night after he </p>

<ol>
<li>Left a robe in the kitten room all day </li>
<li>Put it on after getting home from school  </li>
<li>Kept scratching his eye after playing with the kittens etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, so he's trying an antihistamine to see if this will combat the allergies. From sites like WebMD I've read that the cat allergy is an overreaction of his immune system.</p>

<p>Is the antihistamine doing something regarding his immune's system reaction or is it doing something about the symptoms? How does it work?</p>

<p>Will his immune system learn how to behave whilst taking antihistamines? Would the process of learning be better or worse for taking them?</p>
","<p>A <em>very brief</em> review of an allergic response is in order so that the answer makes sense. Think of a linked chain of events here.</p>

<p>An ""allergen"" is something a person is allergic to, e.g., cat dander or pollen. When someone is exposed to an allergen, they either become allergic or not.</p>

<p>In a susceptible individual, something in the allergen (called an antigen, usually a protein of some kind) causes the person's immune system to produce an antibody (or Immunoglubin, in this case Immunoglobin E, or IgE) to the antigen, which then circulates throughout the entire system. The individual is now considered ""sensitized"". The IgE's bind to receptor sites on mast cell surfaces.</p>

<p>When a sensitized individual is re-exposed to the antigen, the antigen binds to the IgE's changing the cell surface, triggering a response.</p>

<p>Mast cells, found in connective tissues throughout the body - but especially in mucus membranes and skin - make and store a molecule called histamine. When the antigen binds to the IgE's on the mast cell, the cell is ""signalled"" to release (among other things) histamine, a molecule which causes local capillaries to swell and leak fluid: the typical runny/stuffy nose, red/itchy/watering eyes, etc.</p>

<p>So that's a basic allergic response involving histamine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the antihistamine doing something regarding his immune's system reaction or is it doing something about the symptoms? How does it work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The antihistamine essentially blocks the effect of histamine on the capillaries. It doesn't decrease his immunity to the antigen (it doesn't stop IgE from being produced); it just treats the symptoms (stuffy nose, watery eyes, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will his immune system learn how to behave whilst taking antihistamines? Would the process of learning be better or worse for taking them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The antihistamine will have [little or]* no effect - either positive or negative - on his immune system. It is used only to make the allergic symptoms more tolerable.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBKyE.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>*<sub>The immune system is so incredibly complex, many things are still being worked out. I would not categorically rule out some kind of modulation, but for all intents and purposes, this is not what antihistamines are used for.</sub></p>

"How does a breeze cause irritated nose and throat?","524","","<p>The question popped in my head as to how a breeze (let's say one from a ventilator or ACU) can cause irritation in certain respiratory systems (e.g. nose/throat).</p>

<p>I haven't really found a suitable explanation by <em>Google-ing?</em>, so I came here to ask you.</p>

<p>I'm not here for an explanation that I won't understand, I'm no medical/biological expert at all, I'm just an overly curious person.</p>

<p>A simple, to the point explanation would do the trick for me.</p>

<p>PS: Just in case you're wondering how/why this question popped into my head, it's because I forgot to turn the fan off in my room before going to sleep &amp; now I've come down with an irritated nose &amp; sore throat.</p>

<p>PPS: I would've added more tags but not enough rep yet and for some reason <em>throat</em> and <em>respiratory-system</em> aren't known tags yet.</p>
","<p>It does so by drying out your mucous membranes. Air moving over your face as you sleep is going to have more of a drying effect on your nose, sinuses, and throat than still air. This is especially true when the air is dry, such as in winter or when the air is from an air conditioning unit.</p>

<p>The reason the membranes inside your upper respiratory tract are called mucous membranes is because they secrete mucous, which serves a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12510824"">protective role</a> against pathogens and airborne particles. In your mouth and throat you also have saliva, which serves a similar role. Inhaled bacteria, viruses, fungi and dust are trapped by the mucous and saliva, which is then either expelled or swallowed and digested. This is a very important part of your immune system, so if excessive drying leads to those membranes being directly exposed to air, pathogens will have an easier time invading and you will be more likely to become ill.</p>

"How to treat a pregnant woman with a very low platelet count in her 9th month of pregnancy?","523","","<p>My sister-in-law is going through her 9th month of pregnancy. Since almost 3 months she is having low platelet count and the cause is still unknown.</p>

<p>She is in constant constant care in the labor room. By ""critical situation"", I meant the medical staff is not of the opinion to do a cesarean delivery as they fear that blood loss may occur excessively due low platelets, causing a life-threatening scenario. They would operate her when she has at least above 50,000 platelets. </p>

<p>Her recent platelet count is 13,000 and she is just left with <em>7 days</em> to deliver her baby. Somehow, the medical staff is not able to treat her and the situation is getting critical. </p>
","<p>Please note that you have not gived a definition for your numbers. 15,000 platelets per µL? mL? L? It matters. 50,000/L is much different than 50,000/µL.</p>

<p>Thrombocytopenia is not uncommon during pregnancy, and, as in non-pregnancy related cases, results from diverse causes. Without awareness of the cause(s) (i.e. knowing which tests she has undergone and the results), no one here can recommend the proper management of your sister's case. </p>

<p>Some causes of thrombocytopenia are unique to pregnancy and may not be familiar to hematologists. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Incidental thrombocytopenia of pregnancy, usually referred to as gestational thrombocytopenia, accounts for 70%-80% of cases. It occurs in the mid-second to third trimester, and its pathogenesis is unclear. It has been speculated that it may result from various mechanisms, including hemodilution and accelerated clearance. No confirmatory laboratory tests are available, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion. ...[However] we consider a diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia <em>unlikely if the platelet count is &lt; 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, with very few cases having been described with counts 40-50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ITP is not an indication for cesarean delivery. Mode of delivery in a pregnant patient with ITP is based on obstetric indications, with avoidance of procedures associated with increased hemorrhagic risk to the fetus (eg, forceps, vacuum extraction, and fetal scalp electrode/samples).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of interest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a rule of thumb, developing a platelet count &lt; 100 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L early in pregnancy, with declining platelet counts as gestation progresses, is most consistent with ITP. ...Nevertheless, knowing the exact diagnosis at that stage of pregnancy changes the management very little, as will be discussed in the indications for treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A rare inherited cause of thrombocytopenia is type IIB von Willebrand disease (VWD). Women with this condition may develop thrombocytopenia, for the first time, in pregnancy and be misdiagnosed with ITP. Platelet counts may occasionally fall to levels as low as 10-20 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at term, typically with nadir value 1-3 days before delivery, but they rapidly improve after delivery.</p>

"Do adult braces have a medical need beyond cosmetics?","522","","<p>While middle/upper-class American parents often have their children get braces as teenagers, an adult getting braces out of his/her own volition could be viewed as a sign of vanity, much like plastic surgery. While in most communities, braces are seen as more socially acceptable than plastic surgery, both involve modifying the body to improve outward appearance to gain the attraction and respect of others. </p>

<p>Do adult braces have a medical needs, are are they purely to alter cosmetic appearance?</p>
","<p>There are certain types of malocclusion that are have been shown to adversely affect quality of oral health and quality of life, but these are far, far fewer than the number of people sporting braces, adult or adolescent. The need for braces in the average teen, therefore, is no greater than the average adult. If you think of braces for teens as a necessity, it is no less a necessity for adults, that is, appearance is probably the only significant result for both average teens and adults.</p>

<p>However, increased longevity has led to the need to keep healthy teeth for longer periods. Teeth continue to shift throughout life. Missing teeth (today's older adults are more likely to have had dental extractions than younger adults) allow teeth to shift, resulting in malocclusion. Malocclusion in turn can result in frequent inadvertent oral mucosal injuries. This can be corrected with braces.</p>

<p>Missing teeth also mean less occlusive surfaces (chewing surface area). Believe it or not, this poses a choking hazard, as well as decreases a person's ability to enjoy certain foods. Braces or other orthodontic devices may be needed to shift teeth into proper position for bridges to restore occlusive surfaces. Since people are living longer, it makes sense to invest in procedures that will help you to continue to eat well.</p>

<p>Recent reviews of dental literature, however, are showing that the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention in adults are more limited. Malocclusion seems not to have a role in susceptibility to dental caries (as was previously believed), periodontal disease, and temporomandibular joint disorder. Therefor the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention are more limited than previously believed.</p>

<p>Finally, there is some evidence that adult orthodontics can result in harm in the form of root shortening, which can lead to loose teeth.</p>

"Are retainers preferred to fiberotomies after dental work and, if so, why?","521","","<p>Long ago, after years of wearing braces and expanders to correct some pretty severe problems, when they came off I received what I now know is called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberotomy"" rel=""nofollow"">fiberotomy</a> on my top teeth only. I was also instructed to wear top and bottom retainers.</p>

<p>I was... less than loyal to my retainers.</p>

<p>After a period of time, my bottom teeth reverted partway back to their original positions -- today, they aren't even close to straight.  My top teeth, however, remain perfectly straight to this day, almost 20 years later.</p>

<p>However, I've noticed that every single person I have ever spoken to who had dental work done has never heard of this procedure. It strikes me as odd because the procedure was quick, simple, and apparently with excellent outcome.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The lack of awareness of this procedure leads me to believe that it is not that common. If this is true, why is it so? Are there risks? Is the success rate not high?</li>
<li>The procedure seemed to entirely negate the need for a retainer, for me at least. Is this typical? If so, why would retainers ever be recommended over a fiberotomy? Are there only certain cases where the procedure is effective?</li>
<li>Is there any reason, related to the questions above, why the procedure wasn't done on my bottom teeth?</li>
</ul>

<p>Or is there perhaps some more modern alternative to both fiberotomies and retainers that has appeared in the last 20 years?</p>
","<ul>
<li><p>Retainers prevent the teeth from reverting to their original position, and therefore progressively force the <strong>p</strong>erio<strong>d</strong>ontal <strong>l</strong>igament (PDL) to adapt itself to the new position. Doing a Fiberotomy accelerated the process by detaching the fibers of the PDL that are still trying to hold and/or bring back the tooth in the previous position.</p></li>
<li><p>This does not negate the need for a retainer, since there is no guarentee that all the fibers that could cause unwanted movement have been cut, or that other causes have been eliminated. In other words, your mileage might vary, depending on how much was cut and how many other factors are at play...</p></li>
<li><p>...Which bring me to the last point: Even if the fiberotomy was performed on the bottom teeth (of the jaw), the crowding would have happened anyways, and would have required a fixed appliance (lingual wire)  to prevent the crowding. The reason for that is the ""Late Mandibular Incisor Crowding"" caused by the remodelling of the jaws, shown on the image bellow.</p></li>
</ul>

The diameter of the arch (half-circle) is reduced throughout life, and therefore the teeth are forced to get crowded to fit in the reduced space. This can even happen to older people who did not get an orthodontic treatment!</p>

"What is proper capacity of adult non-rebreather masks?","521","","<p>I've looked at a few different brands of non-rebreather ""adult"" masks and all of them have reservoirs of about 1L.  Even connected to 100% oxygen There is no way that's going to give an average adult a significant oxygen boost if he's breathing deeply (3L+ inspiratory capacity) -- much less an above-average adult.</p>

<p>So how do EMTs give a large adult with critically depressed SpO2 enough oxygen?  Are there even more aggressive means of administering oxygen?  Or are there larger-capacity non-rebreather masks (perhaps known by a different name, since a few searches didn't reveal any)?</p>

<p><em>Amendment:</em> I just put an NRB on a tank of regular air with a 25L/min regulator. The bag fills in about 2 seconds, and if I'm resting it's more than adequate. But if I do a minute of squat-jumps my breathing rate rises to roughly 1 cycle per second. Then if I put on the NRB I'm sucking the full bag down in <em>less than half a breath</em>, after which I'm fighting the safety valve and mask seal to get enough air. If I were in respiratory distress it seems like it would only make things worse!</p>
","<p>Ah, but they can and do. A non-rebreather (NRB) mask with 100% O2 flowing at 12-15 L/min will provide about 90% O2 concentration to an adult. This is true even for the largest adult in severe respiratory distress.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. First, the 3 liters figure you cited is the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV). Here are two definitions you need to consider:</p>

<p><a href=""http://faculty.etsu.edu/currie/respvolumes.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://faculty.etsu.edu/currie/respvolumes.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resting Tidal Volume (VT):  This is the volume of air taken into the
  lungs when you inhale. Tidal volume increases with exercise or
  activity.</p>
  
  <p>Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):  Total lung capacity minus the
  volume of air in the lung at the end of a normal inspiration.  This
  means that we have a reserve volume that we can tap into as tidal
  volume increases with exercise or activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Average capacities are 500 mL for VT and 3000 mL for IRV.</p>

<p>Note that the IRV is the volume of air that can be <strong>forcibly</strong> inhaled. It's not something anyone normally does except during extreme exertion (eg, athletics) or when directed in a breathing test. So the 3 liters you cite isn't the amount of air someone normally inhales; the TV of 500 mL is much more typical, meaning the bag provides two full breaths of reserve and the flow of 12-15 L/min O2 completely refills that bag every 3-4 seconds.</p>

<p>So a 1 mL reservoir bag being fed by O2 flowing at 15 mL/min is in fact more than adequate to supply 90% O2 concentrations to even a large adult in extreme respiratory distress. It can and will raise their SpO2 significantly in a short period of time if their cardio-pulmonary system is capable of absorbing and delivering it (which may not be the case if they're in need of such measures, but that's another issue). </p>

<p>Note that a NRB only works with a patient who is breathing adequately on their own. If a patient isn't breathing, or isn't breathing adequately, the next step up is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_valve_mask"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bag valve mask</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlZKb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NlZKb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>A BVM allows a medical provider to mechanically breath for the patient. The tubing you see coiled up next to the reservoir would be attached to an O2 source delivering 100% O2 at 12-15 L/min and then the provider would squeeze the bag at a normal breathing rate, forcing O2 into the patient's lungs. With this device O2 can be forced into the lungs of a non-breathing patient, or assisted into the lungs of a patient too sick or too weak to breath normally on their own.</p>

<p>Generally, once a BVM has been employed the next step will be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tracheal intubation</a>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZCVD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZCVD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As the diagram shows, a plastic tube is inserted into the patient's trachea and then a BVM or mechanical respirator is attached to the other end. A source of O2 is also attached. Once intubated, 100% O2 can be supplied to the patient at any volume desired. And once a mechanical ventilator is attached, much finer control of O2 concentration, volume, and other parameters are possible. </p>

<p>Not shown in the diagram is the small balloon on the tube at the end inserted into the trachea. Once the tube is in place, that balloon is inflated, which holds the tube in place and completely seals the trachea from anything entering or leaving except via the tube. In this way, the patient is also protected by the tube from aspirating vomit, blood, broken teeth, or whatever else might be present in the throat. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>The OP stated in the comments that he can deflate the reservoir by donning a NRB with a 25 L/min flow of air and then doing strenuous exercises. Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I put the NRB on and I'm sucking the full bag down in less than half a
  breath, after which I'm fighting the safety valve and mask seal to get
  enough air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two things explain this. First, he's a healthy person able to do vigorous exercises and then inhale fully to his full lung capacity. Sick people who need supplemental O2 rarely fit that description. In many cases they literally cannot fully fill their lungs with a breath no matter how hard they try, and they are often in distress, which leads to very rapid, shallow respirations. </p>

<p>Second, he was breathing plain air, which is 21% O2. A patient on a NRB will be breathing supplemental O2 at a concentration of about 90%. In other words, every breath the OP took contained 1/5th as much oxygen as the breaths a patient would be taking. I think that if the OP repeated his experiment using 100% O2 instead of plain air, he would get very different results and wouldn't find himself struggling to get enough air.</p>

"Would butter on burns help or harm?","519","","<p>I have read (a long time ago, in an old book) that butter is good for burns. Is this true, and if so what is it that helps?</p>

<p>Is salted or unsalted butter better? And how should it be applied, and kept there?</p>
","<p><strong><em>Short anwser</em></strong>: <a href=""http://firstaid.about.com/od/injuriesathome/ht/06_burns.htm"">Never put butter, oil, etc</a>, on a burn.  This would worsen the burn.</p>

<p>Putting butter, oil, or anything else would trap heat and make the burn deeper. It would also make further treatment harder and would <a href=""http://www.healthcommunities.com/burns/overview-of-burn-injuries.shtml"">make the risk of infection higher</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t apply burn ointments.</strong> Like butter (or mayonnaise), these ointments, usually oil-based, won’t relieve pain but instead will trap heat, slow down healing, and increase the risk of infection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>What to do instead</em>:</strong> Once it happens, a burn is actually ""cooking inside"", and this for a while after the exposure, so the first thing to do is to stop this internal reaction using flowing water.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/content/download/36645/277100/file/PSC1_version%201.1.1.pdf"">official guidelines for general public in France</a> (page 12-14), and sticking to thermal burns here (not chemical nor electrical), you should:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Quickly water the burn </p>

<ul>
<li>Act right after the burn if safely possible. (You are not supposed to put yourself in danger to save someone: this is the best way to end up with two victims instead of one)</li>
<li>Put the burn under flowing water, between 15 and 25° Celsius. The tap is fine to to that, just keep in mind to keep the water pressure low enough not to press the burn.</li>
<li>While watering, remove the clothes of the victim unless they adhere to the burn (should they adhere, don't pull on clothes).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the burn</p>

<ul>
<li>No blister or blister smaller that 1/2 of the victim's palm ; far from natural orifices ; not on the neck, face or joints ; just red, not black and white: this is a <strong>minor burn</strong></li>
<li>Any burn that does not match the criteria above, or any large red area on a children, is a <strong>major burn</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Should it be a <strong>minor burn</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Keep on watering as long as the burn hurts and the victim doesn't feel cold. Not just a couple of seconds: 5 or 10 minutes is not surprising, it's actually fine. Watering is what prevents (more) blisters from appearing later on.</li>
<li>Depending on the pain, aspect and victim's age: watch over the burn or ask a doctor or a physician. </li>
<li>Don't pierce blisters should there be any. Cover them with a sterile plaster. </li>
<li>Should blisters, fever, heat, pain, etc, appear later on, ask for medical advice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Should it be a <strong>major burn</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Call the medical emergency services, and, without hurrying (very important! Being calm is gaining time.)
<ul>
<li>Tell your name, phone number, current location,</li>
<li>Tell this is for a burn, and tell the victim's gender and age</li>
<li>Describe the result of the evaluation you made. </li>
<li>They will guide you in accordance to the protocols applicable in your country. This guidance will certainly include watering, covering the victim if he/she feels cold...)</li>
<li>Do NOT hang up the phone before they tell you to do so</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep on watering as instructed by the medical assistance.</li>
<li>Make the victim to lie down in a way he/she cannot fall (floor, bed...). Sitting down is OK the victim has difficulties to breathe. The victim should NOT sit on a chair but on the ground to prevent him/her from falling. </li>
<li>Protect the victim with a clean linen. The burnt body parts should remain visible.</li>
<li>Watch over the victim until the arrival of the ambulance.</li>

Now akne started to appear again and doctor says that I need to take unidox solutab again during the recent 6 months. Is it reasonable to take it for so long? Won't organism adapt to this antibiotic so that taking it is useless?</p>
","<p>Doxycycline is a member of tetracycline group and these are antibiotics of choice in moderate to severe acne. For this group, <em>Martindale pharmacopoeia</em> states that they should show some improvement after 3 months and that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maximum improvement is said to occur after 3 to 6 months, but treatment may need to continue for 2 or more years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antibiotics act by affecting the bacteria causing acne, their mechanism of action is not based on affecting your organism. That's why the organism does not adapt and lessen their effectiveness. However, there is an issue of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics. To prevent it, it is essential to take your medicines exactly as prescribed: not to skip/miss doses, not to take them with food or medicines and supplements that contain calcium, magnesium, iron, aluminum, zinc and other divalent and trivalent cations. </p>

<p>A concern with prolonged antibiotic use may be their adverse effects. It is important that your therapy as well as your progress is monitored by your physician. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>But, LOL, not a single one of these articles/lame blogs actually deep dives into what <em>specific heart conditions</em> they are referring to.</p>

<p>So I ask: <strong>What specific heart conditions would cause dizziness after/during exercise, and why do they make one dizzy?</strong></p>
","<p>Dizziness or giddiness during exercise is classically caused by obstruction to the outflow of the heart i.e. aortic stenosis (see <a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000178.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">MedlinePlus</a>). This condition is most commonly seen in either young persons due to bicuspid aortic valve or in elderly with sclerotic aortic valves. In developing countries, it may occur due to rheumatic heart disease also. </p>

<p>When a normal person exercises, extra blood flow is needed in the muscles. Hence, heart starts pumping more blood to keep up with this increased demand of the body. However, in persons with aortic stenosis, orifice of the outlet of the heart is small and fixed. Hence, blood flow (cardiac output) cannot increase when person exercises. Due to blood vessel dilatation in muscles, blood goes preferentially to muscles and flow to the brain gets reduced. Hence giddiness or dizziness occurs. It can progress to syncope, i.e. transient unconsciousness and fall. </p>

","<p>Copper is a reactive metal, meaning that it readily oxidizes when it comes in contact with acids. If unlined copper pans are used in cooking acidic foods, such as tomatoes, then severe illness can result. This is why many copper pots and pans are lined with a non-reactive surface, such as stainless steel. This prevents the copper from dissolving into the food, and causing illness. Copper pans, lined with stainless steel are considered some of the finest cookware available. Unlined copper is just fine for foods that are not acidic. Many chefs use copper bowls for whipping egg whites. You should never store foods in copper pans though, whether or not the food contains acids. Transfer the food to an appropriate storage container.</p>

"What is iron's role in oxygenation in the human body?","503","","<p>I hear about runners who need to put more iron in their diet, but then also about toddlers overdosing. I'm wondering what purpose iron serves in carrying oxygen through the body.</p>
","<p>This a vast topic, and sorry for the superficial nature of my answer. </p>

<p>Iron is an essential component of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"">hemoglobin</a>. Hemoglobin is a coloured pigment which binds to oxygen and carries it across the body. It binds to oxygen at a place where there is high oxygen tension (for example, lungs) and release it at a place where there is low oxygen tension (such as the tissues). Iron atoms exist as Fe2+ within the hemoglobin molecules. When oxygen is added to those atoms, they bind to the iron and this prevents the oxygen from leaving it. Oxygen only leaves the iron when it reaches the tissues. So basically you need iron to carry oxygen across the body, because iron (in hemogloobin) is the oxygen carrier.</p>

<p>If a person have a high oxygen requirement at the tissues (such as an athlete), then the body looks to produce more red blood cells (within which the hemoglobin recides) so that it can increase the overall oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. So in order to do that, the body needs needs more iron. So atheletes needs to take more iron because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is a progressively increasing need for more hemoglobin</p></li>
<li><p>There is a need to maintain the large red blood cell mass that are already existing</p></li>
</ol>

<p>RBCs die after their life span of 120 days. So there is a constant rate of RBC production and killing of them. And then there is iron loss from body in various forms. The body has a store of iron (in liver). So if there is not enough supply of iron (as in pure vegetarians who does not take proper amount of green leafy vegetables), then the body will start utilising those iron stores. When the stores are over, then the body will start exhibiting symptoms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency"">iron deficiency</a>. In order to solve that deficiency, various iron preparations can be prescribed, and Iron tablets are only one of them. </p>

<p>So as I had described, athletes may need a higher iron supply than normal people. In addition to that, there are other people too, who need higher iron input in their diet:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pregnant women (they are prescribed iron and folic acid tablets during gestation)</p></li>
<li><p>Menstruating women (there is monthly blood loss, and hence iron loss)</p></li>
<li><p>Growing children (constantly increasing RBC mass, and other growth demands)</p></li>
<li><p>People with problems in iron absorption</p></li>
<li><p>People living in the mountains</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If there is a need to supplement, that can be done using the iron preparations I was talking about. Out of all ingested iron, at most 10-20% is only absorbed. However, the beauty of the human <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_iron_metabolism"">iron metabolism</a> is that it is strongly regulated. Body will only absorb iron if it is needed. If there is adequate iron in the body already, then the absorption mechanisms are downregulated. However, in overdose, these <a href=""http://lifeinthefastlane.com/toxicology-conundrum-034/"">mechanisms are deranged</a> and hence there will be over absorption. This occurs more commonly in pediatric age groups who accidentally consumes excess of iron tablets. In those patients the iron gets accumulated in blood (and not in the RBCs are hemoglobin) and harms the cells by various ways. The only way for body to get rid of excess iron is by loss of red blood cells. Hence iron supplementation has to be a carefully monitored procedure.  </p>

<p>Hence iron is an absolute necessity in carrying oxygen around in the body. </p>

The cough resulting from the infection may last several weeks, and as such whooping cough is sometimes called the 100 day cough.  </p>

<p>Why is it that the Bordetealla Pertussis infection produces a cough that lasts so long compared to other infections, and is there anything that can be done to reduce the cough's duration?  </p>
","<p>As you have noted, the ""paroxysmal"" stage of a clinical case of pertussis, which involves the rapid, exhausting coughing fits and the characteristic ""whoop"" at the end can often be extremely long. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/features.html"">While it usually lasts 1-6 weeks, it can persist for up to 10 weeks</a>, followed by a convalescent period.</p>

<p>One reason for the long duration of the cough is that by the time one has reached that phase of disease, they are largely beyond the help of antibiotics, which <a href=""http://www.prrjournal.com/article/S1526-0542(08)00041-9/abstract"">will not shorten the clinical course of the disease in infected patients</a>, but are intended to prevent its transmission to others.</p>

<p>Additionally, the actual mechanism of action for pertussis helps making the coughing longer. <em>Bordetalla pertussis</em> infect the upper respiratory system and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/causes-transmission.html"">bind to the lining of your respiratory system</a>, decreasing the movement of your cilia, which serve to help clear mucous from your lungs.

"Is pneumonia contagious?","493","","<p>If a healthy person is near a person that has pneumonia, is there any risk of infection for the former?</p>

<p>If so, how is it passed on? Is it via coughing / sneezing or skin contact?</p>
","<p>Mostly it depends on the cause of the pneumonia. </p>

<p>Pneumonia is the name for infection or inflammation of the lungs. It can be primary or secondary. A good example of the difference is pneumonia caused by the influenza virus.</p>

<p>Influenza affects the lungs directly. That's a primary pneumonia, and yes, this is contagious, as the air one coughs out contains droplets carrying the virus. Pneumonia caused by viruses is more common in children and young adults (except for influenza, which affects all age groups), and is therefore contagious to people who have never been exposed to the virus - usually other children/young adults. In general, primary pneumonia tends to be more contagious, and besides viruses, it can be caused by mycoplasma and tuberculosis. These are contagious.</p>

<p>The damage done by the influenza virus in the lungs leaves the person susceptible to attack by bacteria that would not normally gain a foothold in the lung. This is secondary pneumonia, and because <em>your</em> lungs are not damaged - and you already have the same bacteria in your mouth and throat as someone with secondary pneumonia but are not ill - you are much less likely to get sick from being exposed to bacterial pneumonia than from someone with viral pneumonia.</p>

<p>Similarly, pneumonia is more common in smokers with damaged lungs, or in people with some degree of decreased immunocompetence. Alcohol, other drugs, and people with swallowing disorders can aspirate leading to pneumonia; surgery or chest injuries where deep breathing hurts can also lead to pneumonia. These pneumonias aren't likely to be contagious. Finally, some pneumonias are caused by exposure to chemicals. Since there's no infectious agent involved, you can't be affected.</p>

<p>There are now vaccines against some of the bacterial pneumonias, so vaccines against influenza and others help.</p>

<p>Since you might not know what kind of pneumonia someone has, practicing good hygiene is always a good idea.</p>

"What would life expectancy be today without medicine and surgery?","492","","<p>I am from France, and noticed recently that many people I know - friends, family - would have died young without today's medicine.

I didn't do the maths (I have little data and I cannot say for sure that disease X would have killed a patient a century ago) but 50 years old <strong>average</strong> seems high compared to my personal experience.</p>

<p><strong>If today, in developed countries, we had to revert to using only 1900 medicine and surgery (we can discard the medical practices that were actually making things worse), with the same environment, would we live longer or shorter?</strong></p>

<li>Better genes (mixing of populations..?)</li>
<li>Social and technological progress (better working conditions)</li>
</ul>

<p>What could make it decrease:</p>

<ul>
<li>Environment has degraded (unhealthy food and lifestyles, pollution?)</li>
<li>Genes have degraded (?)</li>
</ul>
","<p>Your question is too big to be answered with a formal analysis.  So here is a back of the envelope assessment:</p>

<p>[A] We are worse off today (vs. 1900) because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>tobacco use</li>
<li>obesity</li>
<li>iPods (every adult will be deaf in 20 years)</li>
<li>motor vehicle accidents, gun violence, immense wars</li>
</ul>

<p>[B] We are better off today (vs. 1900) because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>better nutrition (hunger was common in the USA even into the 1960s)</li>
<li>public health improvements (e.g. clean water, shoes for all).</li>
<li>refrigeration (stomach cancer was #1 in 1900, owing to widespread pickling of foods).</li>
<li>safer work conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>[C] Important medical developments since 1900:</p>

<ul>
<li>antibiotics</li>
<li>anti-tuberculous medicines</li>
<li>hypertension control</li>
<li>vaccines</li>
<li>infant mortality</li>
<li>everything else is rounding error</li>
</ul>

<p>[D] Not a factor:</p>

<ul>
<li>genes</li>
<li>alcohol (bad, but probably same vs. 1900)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, life in 2015 = C + B - A.  Your question is whether B - A is better than life in 1900.  </p>

<p>Comparing survival curves, the biggest change in survival is the huge improvement in living to age 5.</p>

<ul>
<li>20% of people dead by age 5 (USA whites, 1900)</li>
<li>8% of people dead by age 5 (USA whites, 1930)</li>
<li>5% of people dead by age 5 (USA whites, 1940)</li>
<li>40% of people dead by age 5 (British India, 1921-1930)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look at the curves from 1900 vs. 1940, there is not that much difference once the initial large difference is subtracted.  I was too lazy to go looking for more recent curves, but I doubt it would be much different.  The median survival in 1940 was 70 years for USA whites.</p>

<p>I do not think this early life difference can be explained by an improvement in medical care.  It was public health, i.e. improved living conditions (including adequate food).</p>

"How to test EMF interference in my bedroom for sleep impact?","490","","<p>I've been dealing with poor sleep for quite awhile (over a year) and one of my suspicions is EMF interference in my room.  I've tried unplugging everything at night, but didn't notice a significant difference, so I suspect it's coming from some other source, perhaps one I'm not aware of (e.g. the wifi router in the other room).</p>

<p>How should I go about testing my suspicion?</p>

<p>For example, is there a device you recommend that will give me useful readings?  If you had similar issues, was there a strategy / product / solution that worked well for you?</p>

<p>That's the kind of information I hoped to find here more than in electronics.se. I beg to differ only because while the title mentions electronics (tools), the overall context / concern / application is around health.</p>

<p>I spoke to a specialist in EMF health and asked which of the devices are more useful and tend to help most in detecting potential health issues. The specialist said the voltmeter was less useful than the Gaussmeter, and that some ranges of radio frequencies impact human biology more than others.</p>
","<p>Yes, you can measure that. You can consider using EMF Meter Tester (Electromagnetic Radiation Dosimeter) which can detect electromagnetic radiation around the place of interest. The cheapest one which you can get can measure frequency range between low frequency: 50Hz-400KHz and high frequency: 30MHz-2000MHz which should be enough. It can be used in home electrical equipment, measurement of electromagnetic radiation such as: mobile phone, smart devices, computers, televisions, copiers, fax machines, air conditioners and other power sources of test analysis.</p>

<p>I had similar issue where I had a lot of cables and power supplies next to my desk and I had slight headaches because of that. I've purchased EMF Meter (<a href=""http://www.birikimelk.com/img/upload/DT1130.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">DT-1130</a>, similar to <a href=""http://www.electronicharassment.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">NJ-1130</a>) and it was showing very high reading around that area (up to 1m far away from the corner). So I think my multi socket extension was just faulty (or wrongly shielded) and the reading was perfectly fine (zero) when I've switched it off.</p>

<p>So basically you should test the electric field radiation and if your equipment like computer connect power ground loop well, it would lead electric field radiation to the ground, to shield it, then the test would fail. Besides, metal will shield the radiation.</p>

<p>I am not interested in medicines like a sleeping pill, as I believe some can be harmful to health in the long term.</p>
","<p>Although the <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/510/165"">other answer</a> provided some general tips about sleep hygiene and noted that melatonin might be helpful, your question actually touches on an aspect of circadian biology that has been very well worked out, and a more specific answer is available.</p>

<p>The question boils down to: <strong>How can I advance my circadian phase by 3 hours?</strong></p>

<p>This is a question relevant for Eastward travel. It also comes into play during the spring time change for those who live where DST is observed as well as in the shift from weekend/holiday to weekday sleep patterns for many.</p>

<p>Begin by thinking of your body’s circadian pattern on an X,Y graph<sup>1</sup> where:</p>

<p><code>x</code>= time<br>
<code>y</code>= activity<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DdHzb.png"" alt=""graph""></p>

<p>Your goal (“phase advance”) is to shift this curve leftward by three hours along the <code>x</code> axis. </p>

<p>When attempting to manipulate circadian phase, the key is to understand your body’s <a href=""http://www.circadian.org/dictionary.html#zeitgeber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zeitgebers</a>.Your body intrinsically has circadian oscillators that confer the cycle and determine the period; Zeitgebers are external agents that <em>entrain</em> this oscillation by maintaining or shifting it along the <code>x</code> axis. The most powerful Zeitgeber, hands down, is <strong>light</strong>.</p>

<p>Now the question is: what is the relationship between light and this curve? That turns out to be slightly complex in that the answer depends on the time in the circadian cycle during which the stimulus is applied. The relationship has been very well worked out in some <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717723/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very cool experimental protocols</a>. Here it is:<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ex2zN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Your goal is to achieve <code>y= +3</code> (which corresponds to <code>Δ= -3</code> along the <code>x</code> axis on the first graph). You can see here that an optimal light stimulus perfectly timed is able to achieve almost a 3-hour shift in a single cycle. The optimal stimulus is going to be bright light in the blue frequency range, and the optimal timing is going to be about 2 hours before your habitual wake time. (About 45 min duration is probably just as good as a longer duration.) </p>

<p>Practically, a good tip is: for two days prior to leaving, set your alarm an hour early and expose yourself to bright light (either broad-spectrum sunlight or blue light from a lightbox) for 30-45 min immediately upon waking. Each day’s exposure can be expected to achieve a 1-1.5 hour phase advance, and this protocol can be remarkably effective for mitigating the jet lag on the following day when you need to get up 3 hours prior to your habitual wake time.</p>

<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/510/165"">The other answer</a> mentioned melatonin. Administered exogenously, this is indeed another Zeitgeber, although much less powerful than light. Melatonin also has a phase response curve that turns out to be basically 180&#186; shifted relative to the light PRC. That is, if the optimal timing for light to phase advance is around 2 hours prior to the habitual wake time, the optimal timing for melatonin administration will be 12 hours prior to that. For most people that corresponds to  4-6 hours prior to their habitual bedtime.</p>

<p>Eating and exercise are both fairly weak Zeitgebers, and I wouldn’t worry about them too much. As usual in circadian biology, <strong>it’s all about light!</strong><sup>3</sup> </p>

<hr>

<p><sub>
N.B. ! Melatonin or light administered at the wrong time does the exact opposite. Although a three-hour phase shift is fairly easy to manage by predicting the phase of the PRC based on prior sleep habits, this starts to become more complicated in larger shifts. This is especially problematic in the case of Eastward travel >5h, when morning light at the destination ends up falling within the <em>negative</em> phase of the PRC and therefore <em>delays</em> the circadian curve. This is the <strong>wrong thing</strong> in this setting and is a common reason for protracted jet lag. Here, it is actually avoidance of morning light that is desired. This is complicated!

"What is food poisoning?","489","","<p>I don't understand what food poisoning is. I've heard that it's something to do with too much bacteria that produce toxins in the body:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Food poisoning is a common...and sometimes life-threatening problem for... people... throughout the world. People <em>infected with food-borne organisms</em> may... have symptoms ranging from mild intestinal discomfort to severe dehydration and bloody diarrhea. Depending on the <em>type of infection</em>, people can even die as a result of food poisoning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is associated with, <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/food-poisoning"">for example</a>, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, botulism, and norovirus.</p>

<p>If that's the case, then wouldn't it just be called an infection instead of food poisoning?</p>
","<p>Food poisoning is something of a catch-all term for any one of a number of infections caused by microbial contamination of food - it should be noted that it is not necessarily just bacterial contaminants. For example, Norovirus is actually the most common food-borne pathogen <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/overview.html"">in the United States</a>.</p>

<p>As for why not just calling it an infection, there are two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is possible to get food poisoning from microbially produced toxins within food even without an active infection. For example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"">enterotoxins</a> might be present in sufficient quantities to produce clinical illness even if the bacteria that produced them are dead.</li>
<li>The two are not mutually exclusive - food poisoning relates more to a common exposure source (food), and a collection of similar symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, and especially in mild cases, similar treatments. </li>
</ol>

<p>Although food poisoning may be caused by an infection, it's mainly a syndromic description of a disease.</p>

","<p>There are many factors in determining how much coffee one can drink in a day. Caffeine metabolism<sup>1</sup> is a big one. People who metabolize caffeine slow, probably shouldn't have more than 100mg of caffeine (about a cup) a day. Fast metabolizers of caffeine can usually have between 400-500mg (about 5 cups) a day.<sup>2</sup> For the general population, 400mg (about 4 cups) should be the limit. Going over this may cause several side effects such as insomnia, restlessness, headaches, and upset stomach.<sup>3</sup> It usually isn't very hard to know your limit of drinking coffee. If coffee has a strong effect on you right away, drink less coffee, or consider drinking tea. If coffee has a weak effect on you, then you can drink more.

Curiously, a Pubmed search with the same phase yields 1100 references, most concerning vaccination. If you Pubmed ‘enhanced immune system’ you get 41,000 references mostly concerning immunology. None of the references concern taking a normal person and making the immune system work better than its baseline to prevent or treat infection</p>
  
  <p>Those who say that that their product, for example probiotics, boost the immune system, point to studies such as these that show that in response to bacteria, cells of the immune system are activated [...] They call it boosting. I call it the inflammatory response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article then goes on to cite several studies which found that being constantly subject to inflammatory response has several ill effects on health. </p>

<p>He does admit that you need to be otherwise healthy (by following what he calls ""kindergarten advice"" of eating healthy, getting enough sleep and exercise) to have an immune system working at its baseline. So maybe you could say that, if your immune system is running at reduced ""strength"" due to increased stress, you could ""boost"" it by reducing your stressors. But this does not mean that, if you are stressed and consume probiotics or other presumably boosting products, you'll somehow get to the baseline. Also, I share Crislip's view here: it would be misleading to call it boosting when it's simply being returned to its standard state. </p>

<hr>

<p>There is another possible meaning of ""boost the immune system"" which does have a basis in fact. If you get a vaccine against a certain disease, you are not exposed to a constant inflammatory response, but you will be able to fight off this one disease better. I was not going to post it here, as this is not the sense usually meant in marketing materials. But the first tip in the first link you gave said ""get a flu vaccine"", so I thought it's worth mentioning. It will not have any effect on other aspects of your health. </p>

"How soon can you know if you will have twins, triplets and can one increase this chance?","472","","<p>I have also heard that IVF and other non-intercourse related methods can do this. IE you can ask the IVF clinic to split the eggs before insertion?</p>

<p>How soon do you know from a natural birth too? Can one increase their chance? Certain foods?</p>
","<p>First of all, just to be clear: IVF-associated twinning and “tripletting” are most commonly of the <strong>dizygotic</strong> (“fraternal”) variety. You appear to be asking about <strong>monozygotic</strong> (“identical”) twinning given the reference to “splitting the egg.”  I will provide a brief overview of both.</p>

<p><strong>Types of multiple conceptions and relationship to IVF</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dizygotic</strong> (""fraternal"") twins (and higher multiples) occur because more than one egg is fertilized. This is very common during the in vitro process because the ovaries are stimulated using medications, as opposed to the normal menstrual cycle where usually only one egg is release. Because multiple birth pregnancies have considerably higher rates of both maternal and fetal complications,<sup>1</sup>  IVF centers and mothers together have to make a decision weighing the risk of multiple embryo transfer with the benefits of improved probability of successful live birth. In some countries, there are laws against transferring more than one embryo, but in the United States this varies by center, and overall about 35 percent of IVF pregnancies are twins, with 7-8 % being triplets.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p><strong>Monozygotic</strong> (""identical"") twins occur because an early embryo divides after fertilization. This results in two embryos with identical DNA (hence the terminology and phenotype - “identical”). These have also been shown to be more common in IVF pregnancies, although the degree of over-representation is considerably less marked compared to the situation with dizygotes. The mechanism is also less clear. </p>

<p><strong>Is this desirable?</strong><br>
Monozygotic twins (and higher multiples) have markedly increased rates of every pattern of fetal and perinatal mortality, overall between four and seven times the rate compared to singletons.<sup>3</sup> This may be in part due to the fact that the process of splitting is itself a “deformity” of sorts that tends to cluster with other deformities. It is also the case that monozygotic multiple births at times share, to varies degrees, portions of the placental sac (<em>mono-chorionic</em> and at times also <em>mono-amniotic</em>). Mono-amniotic are susceptible to umbilical cord entanglement, which can lead to serious complications. Those that do not share an amniotic sac (<em>mono-chorionic</em>, <em>di-amniotic</em>) are susceptible to something called Twin-twin Transfusion Syndrome wherein blood is shunted from one twin to the other via vascular connections between the placentas. This can lead to severe anemia of the “donor” twin and polycythemia (overload of red blood cells) in the “recipient”, both of which carry complications.<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p>You asked: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>can (we) ask the IVF clinic to split the eggs before insertion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your goal appears to to increase the chance of monozygotic twinning.  Although it has been shown<sup>3</sup>  that certain factors do increase this chance (advanced maternal age and some technical considerations during the fertilization step), because of the above considerations about complications during monozygotic multiple embryo pregnancies, this is considered an <em>undesirable</em> outcome during IVF. As such, IVF centers are unlikely to do anything likely to increase this chance.</p>

"Is the Fight or Flight response considered voluntary or involuntary?","464","","<p>Is the Fight or Flight response considered voluntary or involuntary? can this response be trained? Meditation?</p>
","<p>The ""fight or flight response"" occurs under the control of the autonomic nervous system, which is to <em>a great degree</em> (but not completely) involuntary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The autonomic nervous system regulates certain body processes, such as blood pressure and the rate of breathing. This system works automatically (autonomously), without a person’s conscious effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can exert some control over it, but only really a little bit unless you train rigorously for years.</p>

<p>For example, breathing is controlled by the ANS. People <em>might</em> be able - with a very great effort - to hold their breath until they pass out, but the ANS will immediately take over once they do pass out and they will breathe. The ANS, in other words, usually 'wins out'.</p>

<p>Likewise, people can lower their heart rates and blood pressure with meditation and biofeedback (also ""integrative body–mind training"", according to one Chinese researcher.) But if a vicious, salivating, snapping dog jumps out at you from behind a bush, your heart rate and blood pressure will most certainly go up involuntarily, which is not necessarily a bad thing. That same ANS response allows you to run away faster or fight off the dog a bit more forcefully.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>(Quote from: <a href=""http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/games/photosensitive-seizure-warning"">X-Box 360 Photosensitive Seizure Warning</a>).</p>

<p>I have been riding home in the dark lately, and several bikes near me had flashing front or back lights.
I don't have epilepsy, but it gave me a bit of a head-ache/eye strain after a while.</p>

<p>Which makes me wonder what it would do to someone who did have photosensitive epilepsy?</p>

<p>It it actually enough to cause a seizure, or would an epileptic person just feel the same eye strain as I do?</p>
","<p><em>Note: Part of this answer comes from personal experience. Judge as you wish.</em></p>

<p>I have a condition similar to epilepsy, that has caused me to experience a number of seizures over time (ranging from simple partial seizures to full convulsive tonic-clonic seizures, also called ""grand mal"" seizures). This means that over the past few years, I have taken numerous tests, including EEGs.</p>

<p>The basic principles of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"" rel=""nofollow"">electroencephalograph (EEG) test</a> (also sometimes called an electroencephalogram) are well-known and can be looked up with ease. However, they do have specific parts designed to test specific potential triggers - you don't simply lie down in a darkened room for half an hour with wires strapped to your head.</p>

<p>One of these trigger tests involves a strobe light. The patient, lying in a darkened room, is instructed to close their eyes, if they have not already been doing so as per the instructions of the doctor, nurse, or technician in charge. A small light - sometimes jokingly referred to as a ""bug light"" - is then placed over the patient's eyes, at a distance of about one foot. It is a compound device, consisting of many small LEDs.</p>

<p>The person in charge then begins the test, which goes like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>The light flashes on and off for about ten seconds fairly quickly.</li>
<li>There is a ten second pause.</li>
<li>The light flashes again for ten seconds, at a quicker speed.</li>
<li>There is a ten second pause.</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern repeats for some time, with the flashing getting quicker and quicker. It doesn't take long until it is impossible for the patient to tell whether the light is blinking or continuously shining, and even through closed eyelids, it is extremely bright. I've been told to not open my eyes during the test, as it could blind me. I don't know whether or not this is true, but I'm not keen to test it out any time soon.</p>

<p>In someone with photosensitive epilepsy, this light might trigger some sort of seizure - of any strength - or at least increased brain activity. While this has never happened to me, it does happen to people.</p>

<p>I wouldn't compare the experience to looking at bicycle lights like the ones you name, and for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The bicycle lights are nowhere near as bright as the ""bug light"".</li>
<li><p>The bicycle lights do not flash as quickly as the EEG light does. <a href=""http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/photosensitive-epilepsy#.VmDDfGcgnIU"" rel=""nofollow"">The Epilepsy Society</a> notes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between 3-30 hertz (flashes per second) are the common rates to trigger seizures but this varies from person to person. While some people are sensitive at frequencies up to 60 hertz, sensitivity under 3 hertz is not common.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/ipgmedia/national/epilepsy%20action/assets/photosensitiveepilepsy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This Epilepsy Action pamphlet</a> gives slightly different ranges.</p></li>
<li>The EEG light takes up a much larger portion of a person's field of vision than do bicycle lights, because . . .</li>
<li><p>. . . the bicycle lights are typically much farther away that one foot. If you're closer than one foot to a bicycle, you're probably too close. Again, the Epilepsy Society says that this could be a problem if the light completely dominates your field of vision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flashing bicycle lights or other LED lights [could cause a seizure], if this creates a high enough flash rate against a dark background, and if the effect fills your vision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Epilepsy Action pamphlet confirms this - if you're too close.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, people with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures when faced with lights less intense than the strobe lights I've been confronted with during EEGs (see the links). Those of us without photosensitive epilepsy should be fine; those with it might not.</p>

<p>The bottom line? Yes, it's possible - under certain conditions. There have been some outcries over this - see <a href=""http://road.cc/content/news/13526-epileptic-seizure-warning-over-flashing-bike-lights"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>, for example - which has led to some changes. However, these cases occur when the lights are flashing pretty quickly - I haven't been able to find out average rates for bike lights, so any information there would be awesome - and when the person with epilepsy is relatively close to the lights. You don't necessarily have to be one foot away, but being a sensible distance from the bike would reduce the risk.</p>

"Can a one year old safely follow a ketogenic diet?","456","","<p>My daughter will be one year old soon and she is slowly adapting to eating 'normal' food.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I follow a ketogenic diet (I have been doing this for almost 3 years now and my girlfriend for almost a year). I would like my daughter to also follow a (somewhat) ketogenic diet. I don't intend to leave out all the carbs but where I live there is a big tendency to go really high on the carbs. Eating a lot of bread and drinking a lot of milk and have a lot of potatoes or rice or pasta with your dinner.</p>

<p>In The Netherlands you have 'checkups' on your child for the first four years in a (google translate) 'clinic'. These people measure and weigh the child and give advice on the next period regarding food and mental and physical development. They are now basically saying she should switch from formula milk to regular cow milk. I am not really a big fan of milk (partially to my ketogenic lifestyle) and I was wondering what is in the cow milk that she really needs and can they easily be replaced by other things?</p>

<p>The internet only seems to give me information on ketogenic diets for a child if they suffer from certain types of epilepsy. I do not want to take the gamble and cut out carbs if they somehow are very important to her mental and physical development.</p>

<p>My concrete question would be how can I keep the carbohydrates to a minimum while still making sure my child will remain healthy?</p>
","<p>Your have three questions in one now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a ketogenic diet appropriate for a one year old? </li>
<li>Is a carbohydrate reduced diet appropriate for a one year old? </li>
<li>Is milk really necessary for a one year old, or can I replace it with something else? </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Milk</strong></p>

<p>Milk is a very obvious nutritional choice for a small child. You mention that your child has been drinking formula so far, so the switch to cow milk makes sense. Milk is an excellent source of calcium, which kids need a lot of to promote growth. In many countries, it is also fortified with vitamin D, which enhances calcium absorption. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1101/p1527.html"">Guidelines of the American family physicians</a> recommends two or three servings (cups = approximately 600 milliliters in total) per day, to get around 700 milligrams of calcium. Except for fortified foods, <a href=""http://nof.org/articles/886"">dairy really is a very good source for calcium</a></p>

<p>Can it be replaced? Sure. There's children who are lactose tolerant or get eczema, for example, who can't have milk. Should you, with no physical reason to? I'd say no. For one thing, getting enough calcium without dairy really isn't all that easy, especially for a one year old. Two cups of milk are much easier to get into a toddler than 350 grams of broccoli. </p>

<p>Also, for the purpose of reducing carbohydrates, reducing milk intake is a weird choice. That 600 milliliters of milk has about 30 grams of lactose (the only carbohydrate in milk). That 350 grams of broccoli to replace it has about 25. Complex carbs instead of a disaccaride, but if you are concerned about carbohydrates, milk is just really not a bad choice anyway. </p>

<p><strong>Carbohydrate-reduced diet</strong></p>

<p>I don't think anyone would tell you to give your daughter pasta, rice, and nothing else. A child's diet should be balanced, so of course she can have lots of other things - vegetables, meat, etc. Without knowing what exactly you mean with a diet low in carbohydrates, it's hard to say for sure, though. </p>

<p><strong>Ketogenic diet</strong></p>

<p>Someone else already linked to the study <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19064531"">Progressive bone mineral content loss in children with intractable epilepsy treated with the ketogenic diet</a>. The important part here is that this occurred even despite the children receiving calcium and vitamin D supplements and reducing their medication. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study describes progressive loss of BMC in both the whole body and spine in children with IE treated with KD. These findings persisted after correction for both age and height. The decline in BMC occurred despite prescribed vitamin D and calcium supplementation and with a reduction in the number of AEDs used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most studies are of course done in kids with epilepsy - deviating from the recommended diet for children in such an extreme way is only done in studies where the benefits may outweigh the risks. Everything else is not defendable in front of an ethics committee. </p>

<p>However, in these studies, epileptic children on such a diet are compared to epileptic children on a normal diet. Differences between the groups are thus attributed to the diet. </p>

<p>Other problems associated with ketogenic diets in children are <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004670000443"">kidney stones</a>. </p>

<p>Even in epileptic children, the ketogenic diet, despite its success, is only recommended <a href=""http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet"">after several medication options fail</a> and includes regular checkups with a medical professional. </p>

<p>I think it helps to remember what ketogenesis <em>is</em> - fatty acid breakdown it order to get the body the energy it needs. That breakdown can lower the pH in the blood, leading to keto acidosis, which is dangerous. In a child, with a low body mass and a high energy need because of growth, this at least sounds very dangerous.  </p>

<p>In summary, <strong>do not</strong> do this unless necessary. There is potentially no benefit at all, and a risk a parent should not be take on without medical need and supervision. </p>

"Are artificial sweeteners safe?","454","","<p>There seems to be a lot of noise about health risks of consuming artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame and saccharin. Many sources argue that these chemicals carry huge risks of developing cancer and neurological problems.</p>

<p>Should I be concerned? Is moderate consumption (say, a few diet sodas a week) of artificial sweeteners considered safe by the currently available research?</p>
","<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>There have been numerous studies on this topic, and there are a number of artificial sweeteners, so the following is a discussion of three of the most important, saccharin, cyclamate and aspartame, as well as three more which are currently approved for use in food by the FDA, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and neotame, in less detail.</p>

<h3>Saccharin</h3>

<p>There have been over 50 studies discussing saccharin, specifically its effects on rats, especially regarding cancer. About 20 of these involved rats consuming saccharin for over 1.5 years, nineteen of which found no significant differences between rats fed saccharin and rats not fed saccharin.<a href=""http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.full""><sup>1</sup></a> The cancer-positive study did find a link between saccharin and bladder cancer, but used a type of rat susceptible to bladder cancer.<a href=""http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.full#ref-5""><sup>2</sup></a> <a href=""http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.full#ref-6""><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>There have also been multi-generational studies in which saccharin was fed to rats and their offspring, and found that male, second-generation rats fed saccharin were more at risk for bladder cancer than male, second-generation rats not fed saccharin.<a href=""http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.full#ref-7""><sup>4</sup></a> <a href=""http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.full#ref-8""><sup>5</sup></a> However, the same link could not be found in humans, as studies have found that cancer in rats is not a good predictor of cancer in humans. For example, low doses of Vitamin C cause cancer in rats.<a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:PTYDMGWHhfwJ:foodbiology.org/index.php/foodbio/article/download/16465/8560%20&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us""><sup>6</sup></a> With no conclusive evidence linking saccharin to human health risk, bans on saccharin were lifted, at least in the United States.<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ThisWeek/ucm117714.htmhttp://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ThisWeek/ucm117714.htm""><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h3>Cyclamate</h3>

<p>After being approved by the FDA for use in food in 1951, cyclamate became a common artificial sweetener in American households. After a study in 1969 found links between cyclamate and bladder cancer in rats,<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/168/3939/1605.1.full.pdf?ijkey=16a7af61bde2e72ab732c0609872f62949fa6051&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha""><sup>8</sup></a> the FDA banned cyclamate in food.</p>

<p>Later, a long-term study was conducted in which monkeys were fed cyclamate every day for 24 years. One group was fed cyclamate at dosages equivalent to 6 cans of diet soda a day, another at dosages equivalent to 30 cans of diet soda a day. The study concluded that there is no significant link between cyclamate and cancer in monkeys.<a href=""http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/33.full.pdf""><sup>9</sup></a> While a petition has been filed with the FDA for the lifting of the cyclamate ban, however, the petition is not being actively considered for reasons unrelated to cancer.<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet""><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3>Aspartame</h3>

<p>Approved for use in food by the FDA in 1981, a 1996 study posited a possible link between a general increase in brain tumor incidence and aspartame.<a href=""http://www.whilesciencesleeps.com/pdf/329.pdf""><sup>11</sup></a> A multitude of studies followed, among the largest of which found no link between aspartame consumption and brain tumors,<a href=""http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/15/9/1654.full.pdf""><sup>12</sup></a> and no link between aspartame consumption and changes in brain function.<a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/68/3/531.full.pdf""><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>At one point, an editorial intended to directly address the 1996 study revealed that the conclusion was largely the result of ecological fallacy, essentially blind assumption.<a href=""http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.full""><sup>14</sup></a> Of course, this is a small sample of the large numbers of studies conducted, including a human study that found little evidence that aspartame is likely to act as a human brain carcinogen.<a href=""http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/14/1072.full.pdf""><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Eventually, the FDA released a statement citing a press release by the European Food Safety Authority. The statement, in addition to declaring its intent to better study aspartame, stated that the FDA has not been presented with scientific information that would support a change in its conclusions about the safety of aspartame.<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108650.htm""><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<h3>Acesulfame potassium, Sucralose and Neotame</h3>

<p>Acesulfame potassium was approved by the FDA for use in food in 1988. Sucralose was approved by the FDA for use in food in 1998. Neotame was approved by the FDA for use in food in 2002.</p>

<p>The FDA states that it reviewed more than 100 safety studies before approving these sweeteners, and that the results of these studies showed no evidence that these sweeteners cause cancer or pose any other threat to human health.<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet""><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<h3>In Short</h3>

<p>There have been a number of studies reviewing the safety of common artificial sweeteners, with mixed results. However, the quorum conclusion appears to be that even in very high doses, these substances are safe for human consumption. Note, however, that a number of artificial sweeteners were not discussed above, some of which may pose health risks.</p>

"Are all kinds of liquor and alcohol equally bad for liver?","450","","<p>Do all kinds of alcohol increase the risk of liver disease in a similar way? Or is an alcoholic beverage that is higher in alcohol by volume (e.g. scotch - ~60% and up) more harmful than those lower in alcohol by volume (e.g. red wine - 12%)?</p>
","<p>The only difference it makes to the liver how alcohol is consumed is how high the blood alcohol content becomes and for how long - the other particulars of the beverage will be filtered out by the digestion process. Beverages containing a higher alcohol content will tend to cause a higher peak blood alcohol content because they can be consumed more quickly than the same amount of alcohol in a larger volume, and the more concentrated alcohol will be absorbed from the stomach more quickly. The liver is limited in its capacity to process alcohol. Low blood concentrations of alcohol are efficiently converted into acetate and metabolized, but at high concentrations some of the alcohol is converted into toxic acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is thought to cause hangover symptoms and also contribute to liver cell death through oxidative stress (Min, JA; Lee, K; Ki, D. June 2010. <strong>The application of minerals in managing alcohol hangover: a preliminary review.</strong> <em>Current Drug Abuse Reviews</em>, 3(2): 110-115). Replacement of these cells leads over time to enlargement of the liver, accumulation of scar tissue (cirrhosis) and cancer. So avoiding hangover by consuming alcohol in moderation may help avoid liver damage if alcohol is consumed. It is also very important to avoid consumption of acetaminophen with alcohol because processing the alcohol prevents the liver from properly eliminating the acetaminophen, which can cause severe liver damage.</p>

<p>Like the liver, the brain is also only concerned with the concentration of alcohol in the blood and how long it has been that way, in terms of how intoxication is experienced. It will take more alcohol as beer to produce the same level of intoxication as vodka because more of it will have had time to metabolize before the peak blood concentration is reached. The brain also becomes more tolerant to the effects of alcohol as time passes, so that the blood concentration has to be increased over time to maintain the same level of intoxication. So having more drinks to maintain the same experience will be harder on the liver than the initial drinks.</p>

"What can cause a visual disturbance followed by a headache?","450","","<p>Interesting story: onset of a blurred point in a field of vision which gradually enlarges such that it forms an arc in the right side of the field of vision and then after a while that blurred arc fades away.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this happens in both eyes simultaneously, so that the same part of the visual field is disturbed <em>in both eyes</em>. (If it in monoccular, it is different and more concerning, and should be reported to your doctor immediately.)</p>

<p>The headache that follows is a migraine. For this reason, this has variously been called ocular migraine, opthalmologic migraine, visual migraine, etc.</p>

"Can epileptic seizures become life threatening?","446","","<p>Is there any chance of epileptic seizure becoming life threatening or fatal if proper care is not taken?</p>
","<p>Yes. Most seizures are brief, resolving spontaneously within 1-2 minutes.<sup>1</sup> These are rarely fatal. On the other hand, <em>status epilepticus</em> is not infrequently associated with death. <em>Status epilepticus</em> (sometime referred to in shorthand as just <em>status</em>) just means a prolonged seizure lasting at least 30 minutes. It can also refer to a situation that is technically multiple seizures back-to-back, but without complete return to baseline in between. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908090"">A recent review of <em>status epilepticus</em> quoted the statistic</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The overall mortality associated with status epilepticus approaches 20%, with generalised convulsive status epilepticus representing about 45–74% of all cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it has long been recognized that it is very difficult to know whether the seizure itself or the factor that provoked the seizure is actually responsible for death.<sup>2</sup> The strongest predictor of death from <em>status</em> is the underlying cause. For instance, in <em>status</em> attributable to hypoxia, death occurs over 50% of the time.<sup>1</sup> That is because a seizure is likely to be provoked only by a pretty dire state of hypoxia &mdash; either not responsive to maximal interventions or occurring in a setting where such interventions are not available or not desired.</p>

<p>To the extent that death is directly attributable to the seizure, it is generally because of what doctors often refer has “inability to protect the airway.” Normal, conscious people have reflexes that “protect” the airway at the level of the oropharynx to prevent aspiration. People having a generalized seizure lack such reflexes and can aspirate on their own oral secretions causing hypoxemic respiratory failure.  </p>

"Are babies under 5th percentile mean they will be small forever?","444","","<p>I noticed that there are babies that are under 5th percentile. The baby is about a year old and the height and weight under 5th percentile. What does this mean? Does this mean the baby will be small forever?</p>
","<p>No, it does not mean the baby will be small forever. Some children are small because their genes will lead them to be small adults. Others start out small because of issues during the pregnancy, and eventually become more typical. Others slow their rate of growth because something is wrong, such as an illness or a problem with nutrition. That's why growth is measured so frequently - it's a way to know if everything is still ok.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/toddler-falling-off-the-growth-chart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article from the Canadian Pediatric Society</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While children usually follow the same percentile for weight and height (or length) for most of childhood, children growing normally may also change percentiles in their first two or three years, to adjust toward their genetic potential [4]. Using the National Center for Health Statistics (CDC) growth charts (showing the third, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 97th percentile), DW Smith showed that as many as 30% of normal children crossed one major percentile line and 23% crossed two in the first two years of life [5]. Smith’s estimates cannot be applied to the WHO growth charts because the major percentiles charted are different (the 0.1 percentile, 3rd, 15th, 50th, 85th, 97th, 99.9th percentile). Crossing two major channels on the WHO growth charts would represent a greater change, and one that cannot be considered ‘normal’.
  Birth weight and length are strong predictors of subsequent growth [6], but do not always reflect a child’s genetic potential. Intrauterine growth may be affected by external factors (eg, maternal malnutrition or smoking, gestational diabetes, placental insufficiency). After birth, there may be some ‘catch-up’ if an infant was born smaller than her/his genetic potential, or a ‘catch-down’ if the child was born larger than his/her genetic potential.</p>
  
  <p>Growth patterns also depend on feeding, with breastfed infants often growing faster than formula-fed infants in the first six months of life, and formula-fed babies growing faster after six months.</p>
  
  <p>Children with a constitutional growth delay will start showing retarded linear growth in the first three years of life. After that time, growth resumes at a normal rate but parallel to or under the growth curve, or along the lower growth percentiles during the prepubertal years. After the age of three, there should be no more change in growth percentile until puberty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two children I know well enough to know their growth chart positions were in the 10th percentile throughout childhood. One of them is a girl and started her period quite a bit later than normal. Both are regular sized adults and completely healthy. They were just slow growers. </p>

<p>My understanding is that moving down the growth charts is something to look into, but just starting out small is not something to worry about. After all, 10% of babies are under the 10% mark - that's the definition of it. </p>

  <p><strong>GI Risk</strong></p>
  
  <p>Increased risk of serious (sometimes fatal) GI events (e.g., bleeding, ulceration, perforation of the stomach or intestine). Serious GI events can occur at any time and may not be preceded by warning signs and symptoms. Geriatric individuals are at greater risk for serious GI events. (See GI Effects under Cautions.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells me enough, this is a drug that should not be used unless there is no other viable alternative with less side effects. Depending on the dose and duration of the treatment, you have to consider using a drug to protect your stomach. I would leave making that decision to my doctor. </p>

<p>Turmeric, in contrast, does not have side effects. We can <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric#Research"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">read here</a> that  the claims of it helping to reduce inflammation are not supported by strong studies. It may work, but it's not going to have a very strong effect on the short term similar to powerful painkillers, otherwise the evidence of its efficacy would have been clear. However, if someone stops using Ibuprofen and starts to use turmeric and is able to tolerate not using Ibuprofen, then the simple act of stopping to use Ibuprofen is a good thing.

"Faint line on pregnancy test","423","","<p>I've taken a pregnancy test in the morning on two different days and the result was a faint line both times. Does this mean the pregnancy test was positive or not?</p>

","<p>Any line, including a very faint line, is considered a positive result on home pregnancy tests. To be sure, you may want to wait a couple of days (2 or 3) and then take another test. If you are pregnant, then the line should become darker.</p>

<p>One of the commons reasons for a faint line on a pregnancy test is because you could be very early in your pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests measure the amount of the hormone <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"">human chorionic gonadotropin</a> (hCG), which increases during the first few weeks of pregnancy, in the urine. It is possible that you are testing too early and the amount of hCG in your urine is not high enough to produce a full dark line. This can change in a matter of days, though. It is also possible that you have miscalculated when your period was due and tested too soon.</p>

<p>The pregnancy test itself could also cause a faint line. If your test has a low sensitivity, it would not pick up as low levels of hCG, and would return a faint line, rather than a dark one. You can usually check how sensitive the test is by checking the side of the box (note: a lower number is better). Your test could also have expired, causing it to not give accurate results.</p>

<p>Some medications do cause false positives on pregnancy tests, but you can rule this out yourself if you aren't taking any medications that raise hCG levels. It is also possible that you could have gone through a chemical pregnancy, a form of very early miscarriage, which would still cause a rise in hCG levels. Still, you should take another test in a few days, preferably with a more sensitive brand, and if you are still unsure about your results, you can consult your doctor.</p>

"Is a hyperventilation+hypoventilation breathing exercise (Wim Hof Method) more likely to prevent or promote cancer?","423","","<p>Apart from exposure to cold, the core element of the Wim Hof Method is a breathing technique, which alternates between hyperventilation and hypoventilation (apparently similar to Tummo meditation). It consists of repeating the following steps for 3-4 times:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperventilation for 30 deep, strong breaths.</li>
<li>Breath hold after an exhalation for as long as possible.</li>
<li>Inhalation followed by another breath hold for ~10 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exercise seems to have a profound effect on human physiology, which has been discovered in 
<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans</em></a>.
The focus of the experiment was to study the immune response after administration of an endotoxin while performing the breathing exercise.
The study revealed the following physiological reactions (see also <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2014/04/30/1322174111.DCSupplemental"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">videos in the supplementary material</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Increases epinephrine levels.</li>
<li>Suppresses immune response, i.e., decreased pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) and increased anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10).</li>
<li>Blood pH: Increases from ~7.4 to over ~7.7 during hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis); falls back to ~ baseline during breath retention.</li>
<li>Oxygen saturation: At 100% during hyperventilation; temporarily drops to ~50% during the breath hold.</li>
<li>Arterial pCO2: Decreases from a baseline of ~4.5 kPa to below 2 kPa during hyperventilation. The breath hold recovers pCO2 but not fully to baseline level, which is why the minimum pCO2 seems to decrease with each hyperventilation.</li>
<li>Arterial pO2: Increases from a baseline of ~16.5 to kPa over 22 kPa during hyperventilation. During the breath hold pO2 can fall below 4 kPa, and the minimum seems to become lower with each repetition. pO2 stays slightly elevated post exercise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at these physiologic reactions, I'm wondering how performing this exercise on a daily basis would affect the development of cancer?
I am a scientist, but not in the field of medicine or health, so it is difficult to make sense these effects.
Naively, I would think that some of the reactions like the more alkaline blood pH and a more efficient immune system should be beneficial for preventing cancer.
Also, a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5266177/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2017 study</a> has found positive effects of breath training on respiratory cancer.
On the other hand, the exercise involves states of low oxygenation during both:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperventilation: As a result of the low carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin binds oxygen (Bohr effect), leading to reduced tissue oxygenation.</li>
<li>Breath hold: The low oxygen saturation and arterial pO2 probably means that the body is in a temporary state of generalized hypoxia at the end of the breath hold.</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick research on the connection between oxygenation/hypoxia and cancer seems to indicate that hypoxia is something that should be avoided by all means, because it promotes malignant progression and metastasis, and increases resistance to therapy and mortality (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_hypoxia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=""http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/9/suppl_5/10.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2004 article</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17440684"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2007 article</a>, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/oncsis/journal/v5/n1/full/oncsis201550a.html?foxtrotcallback=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2016 article</a>).</p>

<p>Is it possible for an experienced health scientist to put these observations into perspective? I.e., would you recommend (or advise against) a cancer-prone person to do such an exercise from a purely theoretical point of view?</p>
","<p>Apart from monks and nuns who showcase impressive abilities Wim Hof is onto something. One anecdote reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.tdathletesedge.com/blog/2017/7/2/guest-blog-by-vince-tsai-the-power-of-breathing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I’ve also experienced the positive changes myself, […] My cardiovascular and muscular endurance has increased substantially too, with a reduction in my run times, thanks to the over-saturation of oxygen to my cells, activation of my autonomic nervous system and the overriding my hypothalamus, and the changing of my body’s pH level to a more alkaline state. All the changes to my physiology from practicing the Wim Hof Technique consistently, has improved my overall health and athletic performance considerably.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But anecdotes from believers are of course not very useful. Scientists are nevertheless intrigued by all those world records Hof has collected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407914616274"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">At first this seems a ridiculous idea, because our body’s innate immune system has long been known to operate in an autonomic fashion: we can’t voluntarily control it. But what if this understanding was wrong? Dutchman Wim Hof, better known as “the iceman”, certainly thinks so. Hof holds several world records for withstanding extreme cold, such as immersion in ice for almost 2 hours. Over the years, he developed techniques that allowed him to withstand low temperatures. These include meditation, breathing methods and repeated exposure
  to cold. But he also made the outlandish claim that he could exert control over his immune system. In 2011, although we were sceptical, we put Hof’s claim to the test. […] When we got back to the Netherlands, we tested the volunteers’ immune responses using the endotoxin model. The results were remarkable: the volunteers trained by Hof, who practised the breathing techniques during the experiment, showed exceptionally high adrenaline levels – even higher than those measured in people bungee jumping for the first time (PNAS, vol 111, p 7379). They also reported fewer flu-like symptoms, experienced lower fevers and had cytokine levels of less than half those of the control group. These results show, for the first time, that it is indeed possible to voluntarily influence the SNS and hence the innate immune system.</a></p>

  <p><strong>Significance</strong>
  Hitherto, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system were regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. The present study demonstrates that, through practicing techniques learned in a short-term training program, the sympathetic nervous system and immune system can indeed be voluntarily influenced. Healthy volunteers practicing the learned techniques exhibited profound increases in the release of epinephrine, which in turn led to increased production of anti-inflammatory mediators and subsequent dampening of the proinflammatory cytokine response elicited by intravenous administration of bacterial endotoxin. This study could have important implications for the treatment of a variety of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, especially autoimmune diseases in which therapies that antagonize proinflammatory cytokines have shown great benefit.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Abstract</strong>
  Excessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays a central role in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p>A second study also sees changes resulting from practicing the technique, this time stripping the method of its Asian mysticism parts and thereby westernising it:
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612090/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Neurocognitive and somatic components of temperature increases during g-tummo meditation: legend and reality:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stories of g-tummo meditators mysteriously able to dry wet sheets wrapped around their naked bodies during a frigid Himalayan ceremony have intrigued scholars and laypersons alike for a century. Study 1 was conducted in remote monasteries of eastern Tibet with expert meditators performing g-tummo practices while their axillary temperature and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were measured. Study 2 was conducted with Western participants (a non-meditator control group) instructed to use the somatic component of the g-tummo practice (vase breathing) without utilization of meditative visualization. Reliable increases in axillary temperature from normal to slight or moderate fever zone (up to 38.3°C) were observed among meditators only during the Forceful Breath type of g-tummo meditation accompanied by increases in alpha, beta, and gamma power. The magnitude of the temperature increases significantly correlated with the increases in alpha power during Forceful Breath meditation. The findings indicate that there are two factors affecting temperature increase. The first is the somatic component which causes thermogenesis, while the second is the neurocognitive component (meditative visualization) that aids in sustaining temperature increases for longer periods. Without meditative visualization, both meditators and non-meditators were capable of using the Forceful Breath vase breathing only for a limited time, resulting in limited temperature increases in the range of normal body temperature. Overall, the results suggest that specific aspects of the g-tummo technique might help non-meditators learn how to regulate their body temperature, which has implications for improving health and regulating cognitive performance.</p>

<p>That sounds indeed promising. But in what way remains mostly unclear. ""Attenuating immune response""? Well, lowering the immune system's activity might be a bad idea in relation to cancer, putting a brake on overshooting inflammatory processes might be good. Is any of this studied in a larger group? Is any of this studied over a longer time frame?</p>

<p><em>Temporary</em> short time hyperventilation or even hypoxia may have some kind of <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045191"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">training</a> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023329"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">effect</a> that <em>might</em> lead to improved oxygenation of body tissues overall. Doing this repeatedly or routinely may also have quite <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053942"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unwelcome</a> effects. But the <em>local</em> 'tumor hypoxia' effects of cancer that appear as <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17656037"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sustained</a> under-oxygenation of the affected cells are not necessarily the same as what happens in breathing a few times like the Hof.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2017.1329001"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There is, however, a string attached to the Wim Hof Method, <strong>that is the risk that people may think the method is scientifically valid.</strong> Wim is a wholehearted speaker, but his scientific vocabulary is galimatias. With conviction, he mixes in a non-sensical way scientific terms as irrefutable evidence. Many less scientifically literate people believe what he says and several seriously diseased people have used his method as the final straw. Stories of believers circulate on the Internet, in popular magazines and are broadcasted as well. <strong>The scientific investigations are often presented with a biased view.</strong> <br> 
  When practicing the Wim Hof Method with a good dose of common sense (for instance, not hyperventilating before submerging in water) and without excessive expectations: it doesn't hurt to try. <strong>Although the effects on our health wait to be proven, people may feel healthier.</strong><br>
  All in all, I think it is worthwhile to sort out whether and which of the training aspects of Wim's method affect our immune system and metabolism. And, with respect to the extreme challenges, is Wim special? Or are we all, as he himself proclaims, ice(wo)men?</a>[emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>So, Wim Hof is onto something. But what is it? <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308621597"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Western</a> <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527303003504"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">science</a> has optimised <a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2009.0044"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meditation</a> <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032705002570"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">techniques</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360859209000230"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proven</a> many benefits one can gain from these practices, even in their archaic or <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020861"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mysticised</a> form. Better breathing patterns and more activity as opposed to sedentary life are without question positive changes for many 'civilised' people. </p>

<p>This answer assumes a somewhat mediated approach to the technique. There are always <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15136413"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extreme</a> cases that seem to invalidate a common sense evaluation. Trying to do this in a ""cancer prone"" individual? The relation to cancer seems currently indirect at best. If you overdo it, and what is meant by that is completely undetermined, it is very probably bad. As Taylor above has found this post:<br>
<a href=""https://probablyhealthy.com/2016/02/15/13-observations-after-5-months-and-200-sessionsof-wim-hof-breathing-method/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">13 observations after 5 months and 200+ sessions of Wim Hof Breathing Method</a> some aspects become quite clear though: 120 minutes sessions, doing in a car or in icy water, and possibly alone, there are quite a number of such immediate risks involved in practicing this to these extremes. How much more likely cancer is due to these exercises if done so often and so long to <em>really</em> stress out and damage the system is not known via scientific studies. Overdoing it will very probably lead to very unwelcome effects, like driving off the road, so quickly that any increase in risk for cancer will be moot.</p>

<p>Unless this Hof-method or the tummo meditation are more researched we have to conclude for now that there are many anecdotes but almost no real evidence as defined to our standards that this works either way or better than simply ""do more sports"". Only indicators, but a few, point into the direction of overall improved health, if one doesn't faint from the hyperventilation. </p>

<p>Being the optimist I await much more studies on this. Until those arrive: I guess it doesn't hurt much, it doesn't help much.</p>

"Are there a maximum number of times for surgical ablations on patients with Atrial Fibrillation?","421","","<p>Are there any links to research which would suggest an optimum or maximum number of times for ablation on the same heart? Do chances of stopping AF symptoms change with each surgery?</p>
","<p>This is a subject I'm very well versed in since I've had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and atrial flutter (AFL) for a number of years and I've undergone no fewer than five ablation procedures. However, I really can't improve on M. Arrowsmith's answer. It's pretty much spot on. However, I will add some thoughts you won't easily find in published research.</p>

<p>The optimal number of ablations is, of course, one. And for the majority of patients that's how many they'll undergo. Success rates for PAF are very high these days. However, a significant number of patients will require two, with the second one often being described as a ""touch up"" procedure. There are two major reasons why a second ablation is often required:</p>

<p>First, it is very easy for the electrophysiologist (EP) to accidentally create what's known as a flutter circuit during the procedure. This usually takes the form of a tiny gap in the line of burns that are created to contain the afib. That tiny gap allows an errant signal to begin a self-perpetuating circle in the heart that causes the heart to beat very rapidly, often at about 150 beats per minute. This is atrial flutter (AFL). It's similar to AF, but unlike AF it's a very regular rhythm, and it's usually faster. Rates of 150 beats per minute are common. A second ablation to fix AFL is typically much faster and simpler than the original AF ablation.</p>

<p>Second, the standard ablation for AF is what's known as pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). A PVI ablation procedure creates a circle of burns around the point in the left atrium where the pulmonary veins enter. Pulmonary veins are the number 1 source of errant AF signals, so burning a circle around them basically creates a ""fence"" that contains the errant signals and doesn't let them spread to the rest of the atria. However, there can also be isolated spots elsewhere in the atria that generate errant AF signals and those are very difficult to find. Since they're difficult to find, they can be missed during the first procedure and require a second procedure to go in and find and ablate them individually.</p>

<p>After a second ablation, additional ablations are going to be because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The EP's skills or experience are lacking. Ablations require a great deal of experience, practice and a precise touch. Operator experience counts for a lot. You should seek the EP who does a LOT of ablations.</p></li>
<li><p>The patient is a difficult case with unusual sources of afib
that are difficult to find or are in difficult locations. Sometimes those locations can be places that are simply too dangerous to ablate. (This is my situation.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, after a period of time, connections can reestablish
themselves. Natural healing around the ablation lesions creates a new
pathway that allows afib to escape ""the fence"" and thus AF reappears.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do chances of stopping AF symptoms change with each surgery?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they improve. With PAF the first procedure will completely stop AF symptoms for about 70-75% of all patients. A second procedure raises that number into the 90-95% range. So the chances of an ablation stopping your AF for years or even permanently are very good, but as I have learned, a small percentage of patients will not be so lucky.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have longstanding, persistent AF, the success rates are not as good. With persistent AF you're looking at about a 50-60% success rate overall. </p>

"Why don't small wounds leave scars?","417","","<p>I am wondering, why do big, deep wounds leave scars and small ones do not?</p>
","<p>Most wounds leave some kind of scar. It's just that we sometimes can't really tell because it's so small. </p>

<p>Here's how wound healing generally works: </p>

<ol>
<li>Blood clots and forms a scab (this may not happen, for example in burns and puncture wounds that didn't draw blood </li>
<li>White blood cells (macrophages) ""clean"" the wound - the wound may appear to be oozing some fluid. Blood flow increases, the macrophages produce growth factors. </li>
<li>Blood flow increases more, red blood cells deliver more oxygen. Cells at the edge of the wound secrete <em>collagen</em>. The wound fills with tissue called <em>granulation tissue</em>. </li>
<li>New skin grows over that tissue. </li>
</ol>

<p>These stages are called hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. This process can take weeks to years depending on size and location of the wound. </p>

<p>Now, what's a scar? Scars look different from ""normal"" skin because of <em>collagen</em>. Collagen is a protein on the outside of the skin cells holding them together and making skin strong (it's also a major part of tendons). In normal skin the collagen sort of forms a ""criss-cross"" pattern, while in scar tissue it's more parallel. That probably comes from the wound healing process. </p>

<p>In small wounds, you won't notice that the skin looks different because of that. In larger wounds, it's very apparent at first, though scars also start looking less noticeable with age. </p>

<h2>Suggested Introduction</h2>

<p>I think it is important to recognize that levels of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">testosterone hormone</a> in the male body decrease naturally in men with age.</p>

<p>The level of this hormone peaks in young men starting sometime after puberty, but usually in the late teenage or early twenty age range. Typically the level of this hormone in men starts to decrease between the ages of 30 - 40 or so, and at a slow rate; generally around one percent a year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>What happens to testosterone levels with age? <sub>(1)</sub></strong></a></p>
  
  <p>Testosterone levels generally peaks during adolescence and early
  adulthood. As you get older, your testosterone level gradually
  declines — typically about 1 percent a year after age 30 or 40. <sub>(1)</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Testosterone Effects (physical and mental)</h2>

<p>As far as high testosterone levels and its benefits are concerned, I'll give a general breakdown of typical effects (physical and mental) but I will allow you to classify these as beneficial or not depending on your perspective of these effects.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Associations with High Testosterone</strong></p>

<p>High levels of testosterone starting in early adulthood contribute to puberty transformations in the male body such as: genital organ growth, sexual maturity and fertility, growth of body and facial hair, and deepening of the voice. Higher levels of testosterone are also associated with <em>but not limited to</em> increased metabolism (burn fat faster), increased muscle mass, strength, and bone density.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>What is testosterone? <sub>(1)</sub></strong></a></p>
  
  <p>Testosterone is a hormone produced primarily in the testicles.</p>
  
  <p>Testosterone helps maintain men's:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Bone density</li>
  <li>Fat distribution</li>
  <li>Muscle strength and mass</li>
  <li>Facial and body hair</li>
  <li>Red blood cell production</li>
  <li>Sex drive</li>
  <li>Sperm production</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mental Associations with High Testosterone</strong></p>

<p>High levels of testosterone is associated with <em>but not limited to</em> more aggressiveness and the effects of such behavior such as feeling more competitive. It also contributes to sleeping better and feeling well-rested, having more energy, increase in sexual desire and libido, heightened focus and concentration, and more self confidence and motivation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/effects-on-body#Central-Nervous-System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Central Nervous System <sub>(2)</sub></strong></a></p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLoJ1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLoJ1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
  
  <p>The body has a system for controlling testosterone, sending messages
  through hormones and chemicals that are released into the bloodstream.
  In the brain, the hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland how much
  testosterone is needed, and the pituitary relays that information to
  the testicles. <sub>(2)</sub></p>
  
  <p>Testosterone plays a role in certain behaviors, including aggression
  and dominance. It also helps to spark competitiveness and boost
  self-esteem. Just as sexual activity can affect testosterone levels,
  taking part in competitive activities can cause a man’s testosterone
  levels to rise or fall. Low testosterone may result in a loss of
  confidence and lack of motivation. It can also lower a man’s ability
  to concentrate or cause feelings of sadness. Low testosterone can
  cause sleep disturbances and lack of energy. <sub>(2)</sub></p>
  
  <p>It’s important to note, however, that testosterone is only one factor
  that influences personality traits. Other biological and environmental
  factors are also involved. <sub>(2)</sub></p>

"cardiac arrest effects on blood pressure","407","","<p>I was wondering about the effects of cardiac arrest on blood pressure. </p>

<ol>
<li>What would the blood pressure be while cardiac arrest? Would there be any pressure at all (because the heart can't pump blood at all)</li>
<li>Post-cardiac arrest - Would there be an increase or decrease in the blood pressure? Would it cause hypertension/hypotension, and if so why?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>By definition, <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/CardiacArrest/About-Cardiac-Arrest_UCM_307905_Article.jsp#.WApx6KKk0-o"" rel=""nofollow"">cardiac arrest</a> means the heart is not pumping blood; therefore, there is no blood pressure. None at all. So if you were to cut a person in cardiac arrest, they would not bleed.</p>

<p>If a heartbeat can be restored, the findings after cardiac arrest will vary. In general, if a normal heartbeat can be restored and the heart is once again pumping effectively, vital signs such as blood pressure should return to normal or near-normal levels fairly quickly. However, everything that was wrong with the patient before the arrest will still be present, so if they had hypertension before the arrest, they will probably have it afterwards. However, the cause of the arrest may have been a heart attack that left heart tissue damaged, and that might result in lower BP. </p>

<p>In short, there is no single answer as to what the pressure will be afterwards. It will depend on many things.</p>

"Is rapid weight loss unhealthy?","403","","<p>A commonly quoted figure is that 1-2 pounds (0.5-1 kg) a week is a healthy rate at which to lose weight, and that 'crash diets' are bad for you.  What is this figure based on, and in what way is losing weight faster than this unhealthy?</p>
","<p>The quoted ""1-2"" pounds per week (or approximately 0.5 - 1 kilo) is based on the traditional 3500 calories burned = 1 pound of fat. Now, while the exact figure of 3500 calories is somewhat open to debate, that is the rationale. 500 calories a day = 1 pound of loss per week.</p>

<p>The problem with crash dieting is twofold. One, the majority of the weight lost is water weight, and will rapidly return once the person hydrates themselves. The second problem is that in an effort to lose large amounts of weight in a short time is that people will essentially starve themselves, and possibly do so while adding in exercise.</p>

<p>In the very short term, this may not pose any problems for a healthy person, but if the dieter is compromised in any way health wise, or the practice is continued for a longer period then nutrient deficiencies can start arising, which can introduce a long litany of health problems.</p>

<p>Another problem is that people that lose large amounts of weight in a short time tend to binge eat once the diet period is over, and regain most if not all the weight. Many even end up weighing more than they did before they did the extreme dieting.</p>

<p>There have been studies comparing many of the popular diets such as Atkins, South Beach, China Study, Paleo, and on and on. They have all shown that weight loss is a simple factor of calorie reduction. Eat less calories than you expend, and you will lose weight. Period. (And ""starvation mode"" is a myth.) When you first start dieting, you may lose more than the 1-2 pounds a week, which is normal. After a bit, your body will readjust and the weight loss will slow down, however if you maintain the calorie deficit, you will eventually lose the weight.</p>

"what does this abnormality (arachnoid cyst) mean in a brain MRI?","398","","<p>In a <strong><em>Brain MRI (axial T1, T2, sagittal T1, axial T1 and FLAIR images)</em></strong> is written:</p>

<p>The physician who is a neurologist have told us to do another MRI imagery 6 months later.  </p>

<p>I want to generally know (in simple language as much as possible) what the cause of such abnormality could be? (is it hereditary or may be caused by some kind of diseases or events during the life)  </p>

<p>What are the signs and symptoms of such abnormality? (With which symptoms a patient or their relatives should be concerned and refer a neurologist?, for example headache, sinusitis, etc)  </p>

<p>What can be the risk (at worst)?  </p>
","<p><em>First of all, your ""main question"" contains a lot of small other questions, which I think are difficult to answer as we are not your sister's neurologist (we haven't seen the MRI, we haven't examined her,etc...) But I will try to address some of your concerns:</em></p>

<p><strong>What are arachnoid cysts?</strong></p>

<p>Arachnoid cysts (AC) are a collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the arachnoid membrane. The CSF is produced by the arachnoid cells which line the cyst. The exact mechanism by which those cyst appear and grow is still not clear. The current main theories are passive diffusion of CSF into the cyst or progressive entrapment due to a ball valve effect. The image below (from <a href=""http://weillcornellbrainandspine.org/sites/default/files/arachnoid-cyst-pediatric-lg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://weillcornellbrainandspine.org/sites/default/files/arachnoid-cyst-pediatric-lg.jpg</a>) shows you an arachnoid cyst (the structure in red).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DN149.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DN149.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>How frequent are those arachnoid cysts?</strong></p>

<p>Arachnoid cysts represent 1% of intracranial masses. In a retrospective study conducted among adult brain MRI, the prevalence of arachnoid cyst was 1.4 percent; of these, only 5 percent were symptomatic. Symptomatic arachnoid cysts are more frequent in children (75 percent of symptomatic arachnoid cysts occur in children)</p>

<p><strong>What are the symptoms associated with arachnoid cysts?</strong></p>

<p><em>Symptoms depend on the location of those cyst as well as their size.</em></p>

<p>Most of those cysts (approximatively 50%) arise in the Sylvian fissure (so approximatively in the same region as your sister’s AC), although they may occur in any part of the nervous system where there is arachnoid. Other common sites include: cerebral convexity, interhemispheric fissure, suprasellar cistern, quadrigeminal cistern, cerebellopontine angle, midline of the posterior fossa, and the spine. </p>

<p>Cysts in the Sylvian fissure are usually asymptomatic but can present with headache, seizure and less commonly, focal neurological deficits. Subdural hematomas may occur following relatively minor head trauma.</p>

<p><strong>What is the treatment for arachnoid cysts?</strong></p>

<p>Treatment is generally initiated if patients have symptoms. If mainly asymptomatic, current recommendations recommend serial imaging and neurologic examinations (as suggested by your neurologist). 
In general, surgery is indicated if patients suffer from symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, seizures, focal neurologic deficits (= motor or sensory problems in face, limbs) or cognitive impairment. Needle aspiration usually is of temporary benefit and is not a good long-term treatment option .</p>

<p><em>Your sister has also a retention cyst in the maxillary sinus.</em></p>

<p>According to Wang et al <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17277631"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>, who followed 40 patients with retention cysts,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most retention cysts of the maxillary sinus spontaneously regressed or
  showed no significant change in size over the long term. These
  findings suggest that, in the absence of associated complications,
  “wait and see” may be the appropriate management strategy for these
  retention cysts.</p>

My mom also has low cortisol levels. I have no HIV, no known auto-immune diseases, I believe I'm vaccinated against tuberculosis, however my doctor gave me hydrocortisone pills to take each morning.</p>

<p>It is normal to treat low cortisol levels without symptoms? Is it normal not to perform any further screening of possible causes (my doctor didn't)?</p>
","<p>The disease associated with low cortisol is known as <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199610173351607"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adrenal insufficiency</a> (so-called because the <a href=""http://www.endocrineweb.com/endocrinology/overview-adrenal-glands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adrenal glands</a> are responsible for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cortisol</a> production). Morning cortisol is not a definitive test for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.<sup>1</sup> That is because cortisol varies according to a circadian rhythm (i.e. with your body's sleep-wake cycle).  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/XVXTq23.png"" alt=""caption""></p>

<p>The x axis represents time across a 24h day.<sup>2</sup> The transition from dark yellow to light yellow indicates the habitual wake time. The y axis shows plasma cortisol level.</p>

<p>The OP mentioned <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1968/should-chronic-low-cortisol-be-treated-if-the-patient-has-no-symptoms#comment9767_1968"">in comments</a> that this value was obtained four hours prior to his habitual wake time. As shown on the graph above, this is predictably a trough (i.e. low point) in serum cortisol. On the other hand, the ""normal"" range is likely calibrated for the <em>peak</em> level. (This test is supposed to be done shortly after waking, approximating the peak.) The fact that a value below the normal range was obtained is predictable. </p>

<p>For this reason, a confirmatory test is required to make the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. This generally involves administration of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)</a> &ndash; the physiologic stimulator of cortisol production &ndash; and assaying cortisol levels at fixed intervals afterward to evaluate for an adequate rise. Only after inadequate adrenal response is demonstrated can the diagnosis be made.<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p>In direct response to the OP's questions, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is normal to treat low cortisol levels....? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, except in exceptional circumstances, a confirmatory test is required before treatment. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is normal to treat...without symptoms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are notoriously vague</a>, and the OP indicates that there actually was some complaint prompting the testing. Inadequate treatment of adrenal insufficiency can go unnoticed until a stressor triggers a life-threatening condition known as <a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000357.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adrenal crisis</a>.  If a true inadequate response to ACTH is demonstrated, this should be treated. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it normal to not do it any further screening of possible causes (my doctor didn't)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is standard to follow a low cortisol level with a ACTH stimulation test. On the other hand, if this is only mildly below the reference range of your lab, given the likelihood that what has actually been measured is closer to a trough than a peak cortisol level, one could imagine a scenario where it might be reasonable to drop it. In addition to the reference range, the details of the presenting complaint and any physical exam or laboratory abnormalities would be necessary to make a decision in that regard. This part is beyond the scope of Health.SE.</p>

3. As with most things in life, it's actually more complicated. It's possible to have <em>secondary</em> adrenal insufficiency (where the problem involves the brain's production of ACTH) and still ""pass"" an ACTH stim. test if the condition is of recent onset and the adrenals have not yet atrophied.

<blockquote>
  <p>You will usually be considered unsuitable for a heart transplant if you:</p>
  
  <p>Are over the age of 65 – though exceptions can be made</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been unable find any further materials that document the exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>How can someone be considered suitable if over the age of 65 and needing a heart transplant?</strong></p>
","<p>In short, by having fewer or less serious risk factors than the other matching recipients currently on the transplant waiting list. Age is a <em>risk factor</em> that goes into the calculation, not a <em>contraindication</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Age is not a contraindication to transplantation but increasing age is
  an incremental risk factor[5] and it is often associated with other
  comorbidity; few UK patients have been transplanted above the age of
  65 years.  <a href=""http://www.odt.nhs.uk/pdf/advisory_group_papers/CTAG/ukht_guidelines_consultation_february_2011.pdf"">1</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they're saying there is that with increased age comes increased risk of failure. This is because as we age we don't tolerate and recover from major surgeries as well, and we are also more likely to have other illnesses.</p>

<p>To take a hypothetical example, consider two patients:</p>

<p>Patient 1 is 70 years old, suffering from heart failure but has no other significant health issues such as diabetes, COPD, etc.</p>

<p>Patient 2 is 40 years old, suffering from the same type of heart failure but also has diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease.</p>

<p>There's a decent chance Patient 1 would be the selected recipient in this case because he probably has better odds of surviving the procedure, and possibly even better odds of living longer afterwards. But the reality is that there are almost never just two potential recipients so this is a contrived example. Patient 1 would most likely be in ""competition"" with a dozen other recipients, most of whom will be younger and therefore won't have the age risk factor working against them.</p>

<p>In summary, the older patient's best hope is that he or she is in excellent physical condition apart from the heart problems that landed them on the transplant list. The link I cited above describes many of the risks and contraindications that are taken into account in the UK, which are very similar to the factors considered in other countries.</p>

<p>To clarify, short term effects I'd mean immediate neurological or cardiovascular benefits (example). Long term effects I mean would it slowly boost your body's immune system in some way or another? Perhaps decrease likelihood of a stroke (again these are examples, I doubt a cold shower everyday would decrease your chance of having a stroke).</p>
","<p>Short-Term Benefits</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cold showers boost recovery after exercise: Athletes often take ice baths after vigorous training do reduce soreness. You don’t have to take it that far, but you can obtain a similar benefit with a quick cold shower after your training sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold showers increase mood and alertness: When cold water pours over your body, your breathing deepens in response to the shock of the cold (this is your body trying to keep you warm by increasing overall oxygen intake). Your heart rate will also increase, resulting in a rush of blood through your body that will help you get energized for the day.</p></li>
</ol>

<li><p>Cold showers burn fat: There are two kinds of fat in your body: white fat and brown fat. White fat is the body fat we all know and struggle to get rid of. When we consume more calories than our body needs to function and we don’t burn those calories for energy, they are stored as white fat. Brown fat,""the good fat"", is activated when we're exposed to extreme cold in order to generate energy and keep our body warm.Cold showers also speeds up your metabolic rate which helps to lose fat.</p></li>
<li><p>Relieve depressive symptoms: ""A lifestyle that lacks certain physiological stressors that have been experienced by primates through millions of years of evolution, such as brief changes in body temperature(e.g cold swim) and this lack of ""thermal exercise"" may cause inadequate functioning of the brain.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold showers strengthen immunity and circulation: Remember how I mentioned that cold showers speed up your metabolic rate, which helps you lose fat? The increase of this rate activates your immune system, which releases virus-fighting white blood cells that will help you get sick less frequently. Cold showers also increase your overall blood circulation, which can help you avoid hypertension and the hardening of arteries.</p></li>

"Alcohol consumption during pregnancy","385","","<p>In what ways does consuming alcohol affect a mother and her child during pregnancy? Can it cause serious effects on the baby that is yet to be born? Can it cause any consequences to the mother and child during the delivery of the child?</p>
","<p>High levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy can be harmful which can develop physical and mental defects in a fetus.</p>

<p>When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">placenta</a> to a baby and can stunt fetal growth, facial deformities, damage neurons and brain structures which can result in intellectual disability and also cause other physical damage. A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop fully and doesn't mature until the latter stages of pregnancy, so cannot process alcohol. So if you drink at any time during your pregnancy, the alcohol can affect your baby.</p>

<p>While the effects attributed to alcohol are still more common in heavier drinkers, they seem to happen at much lower drinking levels than seen in those with FAS.</p>

<p>The most severe of the alcohol-related conditions (due to heavy drinking) is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</a>. It causes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Problems with physical and emotional development.</li>
<li>Hyperactivity and poor attention span.</li>
<li>Poor short-term memory.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Learning difficulties.</li>
<li>Problems with language.</li>
<li>Lack of appropriate social boundaries (such as over friendliness with strangers).</li>

<p>The UK's Department of Health recommends that if you're pregnant you should avoid alcohol altogether.</p>

<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which advises healthcare professionals (GPs and nurses), advice pregnant women to:</p>

<ul>
<li>not to drink alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy, because there may be an increased risk of miscarriage,</li>
<li>if they choose to drink alcohol while they are pregnant, they should drink no more than one or two units of alcohol, once or twice a week as there is uncertainty about how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy, but if a low level is consumed there is no evidence of harm to an unborn baby,</li>
<li>if women want to avoid all possible alcohol-related risks, they should not drink alcohol during pregnancy, as the evidence on this is limited.</li>

"How much protein per 100g is considered ""high protein""?","376","","<p>I've just opened my first ever USN ""Pro Protein"" premium multi-protein bar.</p>

<p>Its a <strong>68g bar</strong> with <strong>20.1g protein</strong> in it. That's less than 1/3rd protein. Good news is it tastes pretty good...</p>

<p>Anyway, the nutritional information says that it contains <strong>29.6g protein per 100g</strong> - still less than 1/3rd protein.</p>

<p>I was wondering, is this considered a high protein supplement? I would have expected ""high protein"" to mean that protein content is closer to at least 50% protein...</p>
","<p>Within the E.U. the European Commission consider a product labeled as or 'claims' to be a source of protein must contain at least 12% and a high-protein product — or one labeled as such to likely have the same meaning for the consumer must be at least 20% protein.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A nutritional 'claim' means any claim which states, suggests or
  implies that a food has particular beneficial nutritional properties
  due to:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>The energy (calorific value) it:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>(a) provides</li>
  <li>(b) provides at a reduced or increased rate or</li>
  <li>(c) does not provide</li>

  <li>(a) contains</li>
  <li>(b) contains in reduced or increased proportions or</li>
  <li>(c) does not contain</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Your bar then — having 29.6% protein — is indeed high-protein. In the E.U.</p>

<p>In the U.S. it is more difficult to define.</p>

<p>The Food &amp; Drug Administration state:</p>

<p>In the U.S., similarly a product ""high,"" ""rich in"" or described in ""excellent source of"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contains 20% or more of the DV per RACC. May be used on meals or main
  dishes to indicate that the product contains a food that meets the

</blockquote>

<p>DV being Percent Daily Value and RACC being Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed.</p>

<p>From the Frequently Asked Questions for Industry on Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements factsheet the RACC for most cooked meats and fish is 85g.</p>

<p>So for a meat to be high-protein it must have 17g (20%) of protein if the RACC was 85g.</p>

<p>This would vary by protein source, however.</p>

<p><strong>In general, the 20% mark is considered to be high-protein.</strong></p>

"Does CO2 laser treatment work well with acne scars?","373","","<p>Several dermatologists says that CO2 laser treatment is still the best solution for acne scars. Does CO2 laser treatment provide a smooth skin or just mitigate these scars? What are the side effects of this treatment? </p>
","<p>CO2 laser treatments work by vaporizing the damaged skin cells. After the procedure, you will need to take medication to reduce swelling in your eyes, but you can also ease the swelling by elevating your head when sleeping. You will be itchy for 12-72 hours after the procedure. For the next week, your skin will get dry and peel. Your face will also be red for 2-3 months after the procedure. Other side effects are burns from the laser, scarring, and changes in your skin's pigmentation.</p>

<h3>Is it worth it?</h3>

"What stages of REM sleep occur in medically induced sleep?","368","","<p>During surgical procedures or when subduing a patient, anesthesia is often used. Does this put a person into a deep healthful stage of rest like rem stage 5, or is something more like stage 2 or 3? Or perhaps it simply enables the sleep process, and there is no particular stage of REM. However, I'm doubting the latter because doctors are able to measure relatively precisely how much anesthesia to give a patient.</p>
","<p>Sleep and general anaesthesia share a few similarities, but also have differences. From what I have read, they are sufficiently different that comparing anaesthesia to a certain sleep phase doesn't make sense. 
I recommend reading <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390788/"" rel=""nofollow"">General Anesthesia and Altered States of Arousal: A Systems Neuroscience Analysis</a>, which I found trying to answer a different question I had myself. Here are a few quotes related to your questions, but it's really all quite interesting. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The EEG patterns and other features of general anesthesia generally differ from those of sleep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These patterns are shown in figure 1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is similarity between the EEG patterns seen in slow-wave sleep and those seen in phase 2 of the maintenance period of general anesthesia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phase 2 and phase 3 are the phases the actual surgery is performed in. 
For example, a difference between anaesthesia and sleep is muscle tone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in contrast to the drug-induced atonia described above, rigidity and spasticity are typically seen in patients who are in a coma or a vegetative state, and muscle tone is preserved during slow-wave sleep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally it appears that anaesthesia is closer to being in a coma than to being asleep. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>confusion arises because anesthesiologists use the term sleep as a nonthreatening description of general anesthesia when speaking with patients. A level of general anesthesia appropriate for surgery is not sleep but rather a coma. However, like sleep, general anesthesia is reversible and can allow dreaming</p>

"Do zinc lozenges really help the common cold?","367","","<p>For years I've been seeing advertisements for zinc supplements for the common cold, and I've heard recommendations from people who swear that they work, either wiping out a cold completely or shortening its duration. </p>

<p>The studies I have seen were for zinc gluconate specifically. Apparently, once they had a nasal spray that was even more effective, but was pulled off the market for causing permanent anosmia.</p>

<p>Is it a placebo effect, or is there actually evidence that zinc helps? If so, does it depend on the formulation (zinc gluconate, zinc acetate or zinc citrate?) Are there any risks?</p>
","<p>Overall, there has been inconsistent data on the effects of using zinc lozenges to treat the common cold. Most studies have also been done on children, which may lead to more uncertainty about its effects on adults, but some of the studies I will mention have been tested on adults. </p>

<p>One study showed the effects of using zinc to prevent the common cold in schoolchildren. They found that between the two groups they studied (one took zine sulfate tablets, the other placebos) that the zinc-supplemented group had less of a chance of getting the cold. They concluded that zinc supplements have a beneficial effect on children.<sup><a href=""http://ijp.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijp/article/viewArticle/928"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Another study (done by the same researchers as the second study I linked to) tested the effects of zinc lozenges on treating cold symptoms. They found that taking zinc lozenges within 24 hours of first getting cold symptoms may reduce the length of the cold. They do not give any firm recommendation though, because of insufficient data. They also mention the same side-effects as above.<sup><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001364.pub4/abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a></sup> This study is also backed up by other similar study which found that zinc lozenges reduced the duration of colds by about 7 days, again with only minor side effects such as bad taste and mouth irritation.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6367635"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a></sup> Other similar reports' results showed that zinc lozenges not only reduce the duration of colds, but also the severity.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279051?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496046?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Some studies say that zinc lozenges do not have any noteworthy therapeutic effect in treating the common cold.<sup><a href=""http://aac.asm.org/content/31/8/1183.abstract?ijkey=c54e7d9e7cfc347b5eb4aca02fe68276ebe7863b&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""noreferrer"">6</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11073753?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Should you take zinc lozenges?</strong></p>

<p>No studies have provided sufficient information to prove or disprove beneficial effects of taking zinc lozenges to prevent and treat the common cold. The consumption of zinc lozenges doesn't present any dangerous or deadly effects, unless you consider bad taste and nausea deadly. As of now, experts recommend talking to your doctor to decide if taking zinc 
lozenges is right for you.<sup><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/expert-answers/zinc-for-colds/faq-20057769"" rel=""noreferrer"">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>What is the best type of zinc lozenge to take?</strong></p>

<p>Well first, as I said above, there is no conclusive evidence. There is also no definite best type of zinc lozenge to take. Of the studies that showed positive results, zinc gluconate was used the most, but zinc sulfate and zinc acetate were also shown to be effective. Of the trials that showed no noteworthy effect, zinc gluconate was also the most tested type, but zinc acetate also showed no effect. According to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/zinc-lozenges-cold-remedy#2"" rel=""noreferrer"">WebMD</a>, researchers are still trying to figure out which type of zinc lozenge is the best.</p>

<p><strong>Risks of taking zinc supplements</strong></p>

<p>Taking zinc lozenges hasn't been shown to produce any major side-effects. Sometimes, people taking them may experience bad taste in their mouth and possibly nausea. Nasal spray, as you mentioned is also not good. It may even cause loss of smell.</p>

"Is constantly using oily moisturizer bad for your skin?","367","","<p>I have eczema and as a result I have to use moisturizer to reduce the dryness. </p>

<p>I heard that coconut oil is pretty good.  I tried it and indeed it helped. But I was told that I shouldn't use it constantly since my skin will gradually produce less of its natural oil because it has a replacement, and therefore I depend more on moisturizer. </p>

<p>Is that true?</p>
","<p>Your skin will not make enough protective lipids regardless of whether you use moisturizer or not. With your skin, it's actually better if you use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema.</p>

<p>Eczema (or Atopic Dermatitis) is an incompletely understood skin disorder, in which the normal skin barrier function (permeability) is compromised, allowing the skin to dry out more than normal skin. The cause of the dryness in AD is thought by some to be a deficiency of a naturally occurring fatty substance in the skin called <em>ceramide</em>. Others believe it's an abnormal or missing protein which causes the skin barrier to be compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to cause immune responses more easily, triggering the itch/chronic inflammation (this might explain the response seen with topical steroids). </p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, moisturizers do provide a barrier of some type to the skin and help to decrease transepidermal water loss; therefore they are highly recommended for AD. Not using moisturizer will leave you open to more problematic eczema. Your skin will not make enough protective lipids regardless of whether you use moisturizer or not. You should use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema.</p>

<p>Other things which help Atopic Dermatitis involve water temperature when bathing (the cooler, the better), patting your skin dry instead of vigorous rubbing, applying the moisturizer immediately after bathing when your skin has already been moistened by the water, getting a reasonable amount of sun on affected areas, avoiding wool and heavy clothing that might make you sweat, using ""gentle"" soaps (only soaping up areas that need cleaning), showering briefly twice a day instead of once (applying moisturizer afterwards!) etc.</p>

<p>There are some new ceramide-based moisturizers that have been shown to be helpful in AD. Some are very expensive while others are more reasonably priced. Some dermatologists have recommended <em>TriCeram</em>. You can spot test it (one arm or one affected area) to save money while evaluating how well it works for you.</p>

<p>Determining what kinds of moisturizers work best for you involves trial and error, but whatever works, from petrolatum or Aquaphor, coconut oil (frectionated coconut oil and Johoba oil absorb into the skin a bit better so are less greasy), or another type, don't be hesitant to use it. Your particular skin needs it. </p>

"Is it safe to drink urine when you have nothing else to drink?","365","","<p>What if there was a situation where someone had no water to drink or food to eat. Would it be safe for them to drink their own urine? What are the possible risks of doing this? Could there be any benefits?</p>
","<p>If you are in a no-other-liquid situation then not, it's not safe to drink. The problem is that your urine is a way to remove superfluous minerals and other stuff from the body. The body's job, especially in a state of dehydration, is to remove this waste with the least amount of water sufficient to flush it away. </p>

<p>If you then drink this urine, you are ingesting back all the salts you just got rid of. You are not getting your liquid-to-salts ratio better, you are making it worse. So when you are already dehydrated, you get dehydrated even quicker if you drink your urine. </p>

<p>If you are at no risk of dehydration (you can additionally ingest sufficient water from drinks or food), then the above does not apply. As long as you don't have an urinary tract infection, your urine is also sterile, so you are not at risk of infection either. This makes urine safe to drink. </p>

<p>There are people who drink urine (outside of dehydration situations) for supposed health benefits, but I have never heard of any evidence that such benefits exist. </p>

<p>I don't know of peer reviewed sources for this, but the dangers of drinking urine for survival are both logical from a theoretical view point and common knowledge in outdoor lore, for example see <a href=""http://survivalcache.com/water-purification/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://survivalcache.com/water-purification/</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/264/is-drinking-urine-safe"">Outdoors</a> site has the same question, with a suggestion for a possible purification method which might remove the dissolved minerals. But urine is also rich in organic compounds and starts breeding bacteria almost immediately upon leaving your body. So I'd be weary to try it: fresh urine is safe, but urine which has stood around at room temperature isn't. </p>

One study did show possible signs that vibration exercise and vibration belts can burn fat, but overall, the rate at which fat is burned at when using a vibration belt or other form of vibration exercise is low. There are some possible benefits of vibration exercise, such as higher oxygen intake. This review did not provide fully conclusive results, though.</p>

<p>Another review of many studies on whole-body vibration training<sup><a href=""http://www.nutricionhospitalaria.com/pdf/6656.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></sup> found similar results, though they did point more in the favor of vibration exercise having benefits. The review states in its conclusion that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Whole-body vibration training] appears to be associated with three pathways involved in weight loss: inhibition of adipogenesis and reduction of fat mass, increased energy expenditure, and increase in muscle mass. After analysing the literature, none of the results for the proposed pathways are consistent, and indeed are often contradictory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This review shows more positive results than the other review I mentioned that vibration training may promote weight loss, especially when used in conjunction with other exercises meant to help you lose weight. Vibration exercise does appear to be safe, though, so it can be used with a weight loss diet and exercises to help promote weight loss. Though this review was about whole-body vibration training, vibration belts work in a similar fashion, so it is likely that vibration belts may produce similar results.</p>

"Laptops in the dark and miscalculating bats: how dangerous is that for rabies?","359","","<p>A few nights ago, I was using my laptop outside in the dark. Some moths and other insects were flying around in the light it was emitting, but unfortunately I didn't think anything about this from a bat's perspective. </p>

<p>Suddenly (and incredibly silently) something flew into my face, completely blocking my vision momentarily. I thought at first that it was a giant moth, but it was too fast for a moth, and besides, it flew away immediately. But it took a few moments to realize that it was the wing of a flying bat that had basically hit me in the face. I had no scratches, no blood, didn't feel any fluid when it hit me, and I washed myself well.</p>

<p>About 15 years ago, I was exposed to the saliva of a known rabid animal and had completed a post-exposure prophylaxis series of 5 vaccines as well as getting a rabies immune globulin shot, so I wasn't overly concerned.</p>

<p>I know that any significant first exposure to a potentially rabid animal, or a possible rabies-vector (bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, etc.) merits a visit to an emergency room and immunization. But what about this situation? Are there clear guidelines about post-exposure prevention in people who have been previously immunized?</p>
","<p>This event occurred in the US. In the US, enzootic (dog-to-dog) canine rabies virus has been virtually eliminated through vaccination and stray control programs, making wild animals the primary concern.</p>

<p>It is quite true, as @EMT_Jedi stated, that rabies is usually caused by a bite. However, there is reason to be vaccinated after any strange contact with a bat. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dangerous and common route of rabies exposure is from the bite of a rabid mammal. An exposure to rabies also might occur when the virus, from saliva or other potentially infectious material (e.g., neural tissue), is introduced into fresh, open cuts in skin or onto <em>mucous membranes</em> (nonbite exposure). <strong>...Exposures to bats deserve special assessment because bats can pose a greater risk for infecting humans under certain circumstances that might be considered inconsequential from a human perspective.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How dangerous is a bat encounter? From a risk to benefit ratio analysis, they are very, very dangerous. On the one hand, not all bats are infected with rabies, and there are some risks to the vaccine (fewer with the new vaccine, though.) On the other, rabies is considered universally fatal, making the benefit of treatment high. Only a few humans (including <a href=""http://hubpages.com/hub/Rabies-in-Humans-Symptoms-and-Treatment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jeanna Giese</a>) have ever survived the illness<sup><b>*</sup></b>; until these recent survivals, rabies was considered universally fatal.</p>

<p>During 1990-2007, 34 bat-associated human cases of rabies were reported in the US: 6 cases reported a bat bite, and 2 reported a probable bite; in 15 cases, physical contact was reported (e.g., the removal of a bat from the home or workplace or the presence of a bat in the room where the person had been sleeping), but no bite was documented; and in 11 cases, no bat encounter was reported, but the rabies virus was bat-specific.</p>

<p>In other words: Of 34 deaths from bat-related rabies virus, only 8 (or 24%) were associated with a bite/probable bite, 15 cases (44%) involved <em>touching</em> a bat, and in 11 cases (32%) had no known exposure to a bat at all, but were caused by a bat.</p>

<p><em>Any encounter with a bat, even a dead one, must be evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis.</em> </p>

<p>In the case discussed in the OP, the person was previously vaccinated. The CDC recommendation (also verified by the state department of health's epidemiologist), is,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Previously vaccinated persons... should receive 2 vaccine doses, the first dose immediately and the second dose 3 days later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Previously vaccinated persons are those 1. who have previously received complete vaccination regimens (pre-exposure or postexposure) with a cell culture vaccine or 2. persons who have been vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have previously had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer.)</p>

<p>Rabies cases have occurred among exposed persons who received rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis and did not receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis, indicating that pre-exposure prophylaxis in humans is not universally effective without postexposure prophylaxis. In other words, it doesn't matter if you've been vaccinated or not, if you've been exposed - especially to a bat - you need to be treated. </p>

<hr>

<p>Unfortunately, in the US, animal rabies is common, and ~23,000 persons/ year receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). (It may well be higher, as no reporting mandate exists.) With the elimination of canine rabies virus variants and enzootic transmission among dogs, human rabies is now rare in the United States, with an average of one or two cases occurring annually since 1960.  </p>

<p>In the US in 2013, of the three human cases reported, 2 were involved in organ transplants (raccoon rabies virus variant) and one was a Guatemalan (canine rabies virus variant). </p>

<p>In 2012, one human died from an exposure to a bat. He touched a bat under a bridge. He did not report a bite to a witness. He became ill while traveling, and died in Switzerland. A number of humans exposed to his saliva (including his Swiss caregivers) received PEP.</p>

I like to crack my knuckles, but I want to stop if it can have negative effects. What have scientific studies said about this subject?</p>
","<p>A common medical myth is that cracking your knuckles causes arthritis, but is has been shown that cracking your knuckles, and popping your joints in general, will not raise your risk for developing arthritis.<sup><a href=""http://www.jabfm.org/content/24/2/169"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a></sup> It has also been shown to not cause degenerative joint disease in your hand joints in old age.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1129752/pdf/westjmed00297-0049.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">2</a></sup></p>

One study from 1990,<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1004074/?tool=pubmed"" rel=""noreferrer"">3</a></sup> showed that, while cracking your knuckles does not increase your risk of arthritis, it does impair your hand function.

Acute injuries to ligaments in the knuckles as a result of cracking knuckles has also been recorded.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10067714"" rel=""noreferrer"">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There are no physical benefits to cracking your knuckles. It has been observed that there is a possibly perceived sense of therapeutic release when cracking your knuckles, which is most likely the reason that many people do it habitually.

<p>It seems that every time I try to shave my pubic hair (like a bikini line), I always make it look a lot worse than before shaving... I'd much rather have a few swaths of hair than bright red inflamed razor burn and itchy red ingrown hairs.</p>

<p>I always make sure my razor is sharp and clean, and that my skin isn't lather/shaving cream is non-scented (so as not to irritate my skin), and that the skin is warm from the water and well covered in lather, and then I shave. And it looks and feels good for about 24 hours, but after that.... all sorts of tiny welts bubble up and I begin itching up a storm. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a certain direction to shave? Is there a different instrument I should be using instead of my razor? 
How do I shave my pubic hair without it backfiring on me?</strong> </p>
","<p>You should trim the pubic hair preferably with scissors before shaving.</p>

<p>You may even consider only trimming alone. But if you must shave, then trim first. Also endeavour to stretch your skin  before shaving. And apply Aloe Vera after shaving. Some would recommend Hydrocortisone, but I'm not a fan of medications....I'm a fan of trimming :)</p>

"Is there a best time of the day to measure blood pressure?","353","","<p>Does it even matter if I measure my blood pressure at night or in morning or during lunch time?</p>

<p>What is the best time of the day to measure blood pressure?</p>
","<p>Blood pressure of a person varies throughout the day. This is attributed to numerous factors including stimuli from your sorroundings. As an innate tendency of the body. blood pressure is lower at night when you sleep, and is higher when you wake up in the morning. It continuously increases(roughly) as the day progresses. </p>

<p>So there is no one best time to measure your blood pressure. If what you are looking to do is to monitor your blood pressure, then it is important that you measure it at the same time everyday - at whatever time of the day it is. If what you are trying to get is an accurate measurement, then you are better of measuring it at two different times of the day(in the morning and in the evening) and taking an average, or measure it at two different times and report the readings along with the time of the day the measurement was taken. If you are on any medication to control your blood pressure, then you should measure your blood pressure once in the morning before taking any medications and once in the evening (assuming that you take medication in the morning). However, your doctor may specifically ask you to measure your blood pressure at a particular time of the day. That is because he is interested in that particular value for some reason. </p>

In the studies, high doses of topical <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinyl_palmitate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">retinyl palmitate</a> (a form of vitamin A) were shown to accelerate cancer (skin tumors or lesions) in lab animals that grew significantly faster than mice treated with vitamin-free cream (NTP 2009).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dFPlUm.png"" alt=""Low doses of Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) significantly speed growth of skin tumors and lesions in lab animals - chart""></p>

<p><sup>Source: EWG analysis of data from FDA photocarcinogenicity study of retinyl palmitate (NTP 2009). Percent decreases in time to development of a significant tumor or lesion (for animals exposed to cream laced with retinyl palmitate) are relative to that for animals exposed to cream free of the compound.</sup></p>

<p>Scientists have known for some time that retinyl palmitate can spur excess skin growth (hyperplasia), and that in sunlight it can form free radicals that damage DNA (NTP 2000).</p>

<p>Previous data were preliminary, however in 2011 the link between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinyl_palmitate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">retinyl palmitate</a> (RP), sunlight and the increased risk of cancer has been confirmed by the National Toxicology Program after a year long <a href=""http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/about_ntp/trpanel/2011/january/drafttr568.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study on mice</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EWG</a> and and New York Senator Chuck Schumer have called attention to the fact that high doses of topical retinyl palmitate were shown to accelerate cancer in lab animals and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EWG</a> published the following <a href=""http://www.ewg.org/news/news-releases/2011/01/26/nih-panel-links-vitamin-sunscreen-skin-tumors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">statement</a> (which was scheduled for immediate release):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key independent science advisory panel has voted to confirm federal researchers' conclusion that retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A found in two-fifths of U.S. sunscreens, speeds the development of skin tumors and lesions when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight.</p>
  
  <p>""A compound that causes skin damage and tumors on sun-exposed skin has no place in sunscreens or other daytime skin products,"" said Jane Houlihan, EWG senior vice president for research.</p>
  
  <p>More than 200 sunscreens from 44 companies listed vitamin A or retinyl palmitate on their labels in 2010, according to EWG's analysis of beach and sport sunscreens with SPF ratings of 15 or higher.</p>
  
  <p>In light of those findings, EWG recommends that manufacturers of cosmetics, sunscreens and other personal care products remove retinyl palmitate from all products to be used on sun-exposed skin and that consumers avoid buying products that contain this chemical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite of that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_health_risks_of_sunscreen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sunscreen controversy</a>, another study from 2010 by JAAD determined that ""there is no convincing evidence to support the notion that [retinyl palmitate] in sunscreens is carcinogenic."". Therefore EWG  has since refuted this analysis directly<sup><a href=""http://www.ewg.org/research/what-scientists-say-about-vitamin-sunscreen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(2011)</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A panel of independent scientists convened by the NTP in January 2011 unanimously <strong>confirmed the study’s conclusion that retinyl palmitate “enhanced the photocarcinogenic activity” of sunlight</strong> (NTP 2011).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The strong scientific consensus that has formed around the NTP-FDA vitamin A study has afforded the FDA an exceptional opportunity to take a bold public health stand on a cosmetic ingredient that has proven harmful in multiple studies<sup><a href=""http://www.ewg.org/research/what-scientists-say-about-vitamin-sunscreen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(2011)</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since then the FDA has set a minimum performance standard for sunscreens that use the term “broad spectrum” to denote that they provide a measure of protection from ultraviolet-A rays.</p>

<p>The most recent government scientific study from August 2012 by NTP has demonstrated that <strong>retinyl palmitate speeds photo-carcinogenic effects on test animals</strong> and concluded that diisopropyl adipate increased incidence of skin tumors in mice, and the addition of either retinoic acid or retinyl palmitate both exacerbated the rate and frequency of tumors<sup><a href=""http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/results/pubs/longterm/reports/longterm/tr500580/listedreports/tr568/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(2012)</a>,<a href=""http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/lt_rpts/tr568_508.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(PDF)</a></sup>. The study (Photococarcinogenesis Study Of Retinoic Acid And Retinyl Palmitate) was conducted at a federal research center co-hosted by the FDA and NTP, found that mice treated with <strong>small doses of retinyl palmitate and ultraviolet light developed skin tumors faster than untreated</strong>, light-exposed mice or those treated only with a control cream. There were <strong>more numerous tumors on every animal treated with retinyl palmitate</strong>.</p>

<p>And the conclusion was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under the conditions of these studies, the topical treatment of SKH-1 mice with the control cream resulted in earlier onsets of in-life skin lesions and higher incidences and multiplicities of in-life skin lesions, when compared to untreated controls, in the absence and presence of SSL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>This graphic presents skin tumor onset data for female and male mice exposed to the amount of UV light equivalent to 30 percent of the UV dose that causes sunburn in people. The bottom axis indicates weeks of retinyl palmitate + light treatment. (NTP 2010).</sup></p>

<p>The sunscreen industry and its paid consultants have rejected the NTP findings.</p>

<p>Whether RP in sunscreens is carcinogenic is a controversial issue for the cosmetics industry and FDA is reviewing data from several studies since July 2009. Nearly 33 years after it began considering regulation of sunscreen products, the FDA has yet to review or certify the safety of chemicals formulated into sunscreen products.</p>

<p>EWG supports FDA’s proposal for further testing to determine the potential phototoxicity and/or photocarcinogenicity of diisopropyl adipate. However, more tests are likely to take some years with detailed toxicity testing with action to remove harmful ingredients from body care products. And until the government takes decisive action, consumers can have no confidence that the regulatory system for sunscreens and cosmetics is screening out suspect ingredients.</p>

"Is smoking during pregnancy harmful to child and mother?","351","","<p>In what way does smoking cigarettes by the mother affect the child and the mother during the pregnancy? What are further consequences it might have during the pregnancy and delivery of the baby?</p>
","<p>Smoking during pregnancy is bad. <strong><em>Really bad</em></strong>. It will be damaging to the baby, and possibly even to the mother.</p>

<p>Firstly, smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriages. It can also cause premature birth, which can lead to many health complications, such as low weight, feeding difficulties, and breathing problems. A mother who smokes while pregnant is also twice as likely to have abnormal bleeding during both pregnancy and delivery. This is dangerous for both the birth mother and the baby. Smoking can also cause some birth defects and puts the baby at a higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The child also has a higher chance of having Cerebral Palsy (CP). When a child of a mother who smoked during pregnancy grows older, they might have lung and brain damage as they grow older.</p>

<p>If a mother is exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy, there is still a risk of many of the complications stated above. So, whether you are a pregnant mother or the husband of one or anyone else living or spending a lot of time with a pregnant mother, don't smoke. <strong>It's not worth it.</strong></p>

Now I would like to know: If I use my brain too much, will it suffer from similar stuff, for instance, because there is too much blood flow in the blood vessels of the skull?</p>

"Can weak people use their feet when doing CPR?","349","","<p>Could doing CPR with a foot cause harm to the recipient? </p>

<p>In a situation where the rescuer were unable to continue due to fatigue of the arms, is there a way to safely do CPR with the foot?  </p>
","<p>Mechanically, if you have good enough foot control to be able to meet compressions guidelines, then a compression is a compression.  But there are a few things to consider. Most importantly, what a good compression is and how to achieve it, and whether you can achieve it with your foot.</p>

<p>To begin, CPR guidelines <a href=""https://eccguidelines.heart.org/index.php/american-heart-association/"" rel=""nofollow"">are updated regularly</a> based upon research into effectiveness and outcomes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://eccguidelines.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-AHA-Guidelines-Highlights-English.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Rate and depth</a> are the 2 primary factors in maximizing circulation while allowing the heart enough filling time. (page 39)  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.firstaidweb.com/adult4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Placement</a> is also important for minimizing trauma to the ribcage (i.e. dislocating and breaking ribs, which can puncture lungs etc)</p>

<p><strong><em>Guidelines FOR ADULTS only:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Rate:  100-120 compressions per minute.  

<ul>
<li>If you have good control, fairly straightforward.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Depth: 2 - 2.4 inches (5 to 6 cm).  </p>

<ul>
<li>This is the <strong>application of the RIGHT FORCE for THE RIGHT compression depth.</strong></li>
<li>Compressions deeper than that have a higher rate of complications.</li>
<li>THIS may be more difficult, as a leg weighs more than an arm, and likely less easy to control force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Placement: middle of sternum, interlocking fingers, and pulling fingers back so the heel of the palm is what presses on the sternum.</p>

<ul>
<li>THIS is probably where using a foot would be most difficult.  Too wide and you extend beyond the width of the sternum, increasing risk of rib fracture and dislocation - and pneumothorax etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BUT going back to the reason why we do compressions, if someone drops without a pulse and is in need of CPR, they would likely die without it.</strong>  </p>

<p>So if you were to do CPR with the narrowest part of your foot, <strong>focusing on controlling depth and rate,</strong> would the risks of fracture from too wide of a pressure base be better than NO COMPRESSIONS at all (or too weak ones) because your arms fatigue out?  </p>

<p>I speculate that most people would prefer to have foot CPR and risk fractures/pneumothorax in order to not (almost certainly) die. However this part of the discussion would perhaps belong better in philosophy.se; I would be very interested to see a if there is a good argument for <em>not</em> doing it, or a discussion of litigation vs Good Samaritan laws.</p>

<p>But the point of this response was a discussion of the biomechanics of CPR for a foot.</p>

"Is long-term use of ear plugs harmful?","347","","<p>I wear ear plugs while sleeping every night. Is such long-term use of ear plugs harmful in any way?</p>

<p>I have been doing so the past 5 years without any noticeable problems or effects.</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Can-Prolonged-Earplug-Use-Cause-Damage-Ears-8872394"" rel=""nofollow"">one site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>studies show that long-term use of foam earplugs can cause earwax to build up or become impacted. Earplugs block the outward flow of earwax that our bodies naturally produce in order to self-clean the ears. Foam plugs are often pushed in too far, which can also pack the wax deep inside your ear canal, and possibly against the eardrum. You'll end up with constant ringing of the ears (tinnitus), pain, or hearing loss. What's more — not to gross you out — bacteria thrive on warm, moist, foam earplugs, and since they can't be thoroughly cleaned, people often end up with ear infections.</p>
  
  <p>Using store-bought foam earplugs that don't fit your ear perfectly can also irritate the skin, another cause of infection, so if you only use them every so often, it's best to invest in a custom-molded pair. These will fit your ears like a glove, and reduce the risk of being pushed in too far. They're also easier to keep clean, so your risk of infection is greatly reduced.</p>

"Why does your head get enough blood and your feet don't when lifted above your body?","347","","<p>When I lift my feet up they go numb and don't get enough blood I suppose. 
Why isn't the same thing happening for my head in a normal upright posture?</p>
","<p>This is a very good question. The answer: <strong>because your head was meant to be above your body!</strong></p>

<p>Your body has very specific mechanisms for maintaining a constant blood flow in the cerebral circulation despite shifts in blood pressure, either due to changing blood pressure in the rest of the circulation or due to a different 'local' pressure because of position . This is termed <em>autoregulation</em>.</p>

<p>The blood pressure that the brain 'sees' is called 'cerebral perfusion pressure' (CPP). Technically CPP is the difference between intra-arterial pressure and the pressure in the veins, but venous pressure is very low (2-5 mm Hg), so we can estimate it as the arterial blood pressure (here, a weighted average of systolic and diastolic pressures). In a normal person accustomed to normal blood pressures, the body can maintain a constant blood flow of ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute with a CPP range of ~60 to 160 mmHg. That’s a big range!</p>

<p>The mechanisms of autoregulation are incompletely understood. Most likely reductions in CPP stimulate the release of substances that cause vasodilation (candidates include H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, O<sub>2</sub>, adenosine), thereby increasing flow. On the other side, high pressures stimulate constriction of the myocites in cerebral vessels, reducing flow. </p>

<p>The end result is that your brain ‘sees’ a relatively constant pressure regardless of what position you’re in or other factors that may change blood pressure. That having been said, if blood pressure fluctuates outside the range for which auto regulation can accommodate, position does indeed matter for blood pressure. If a patient is markedly hypotensive, for instance, it is traditional to tilt the bed so that their head is below their body.<sup>1</sup> At the extremes, this manipulation can indeed affect blood flow to the brain.  </p>

"Does sitting too much causes hip pain?","342","","<p>This is my first question here, and I don't know if here is a right place for it. 
I am a student, and I study software engineering, so I have to sit down for a long time a day, to study, and I study more than 6 hours usually. about 6 months ago, I experienced a sudden, chronic pain, in my hip, outer side and close to my leg. it lasts about 3 or 4 minutes, then I was alright again. but now frequency of the pain is getting more, it happen on both sides, and there is no situation that trigger that! sometimes, I am trying to sleep! or sometimes I am standing still! it may happens any time. the pain is just like the pain of injection, but it remains for about 30 seconds, to sometimes 5 minutes.</p>

<p>is it because of sitting too much? and if it is, what should I do? </p>
","<p>Your hips suffer from prolonged sitting, becoming tight and limited in range of motion because they are rarely extended. In the elderly, decreased hip mobility is a leading cause of falls. </p>

<p>Sitting also does nothing for your glutes, which may become weakened, affecting your stability and the power of your stride when walking and jumping.</p>

<p>Nerve irritation- The major nerves controlling lower leg function cross the hip. Irritation of these nerves can cause pain through the hip and/or down the leg. Injury to the sciatic nerve frequently causes pain along the outer thigh or down the back of the leg; this is called sciatica</p>

<p>In short, at the molecular level, your body was designed to be active and on the move all day long. When you stop moving for extended periods of time, it's like telling your body it's time to shut down and prepare for death. </p>

<p>HIP PAIN RELIEF</p>

<p>If pain is troublesome, you can take a pain medication such as acetaminophen(Tylenol). A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID) such as ibuprofen(e.g Advil, Motrin), or naproxen(e.g Aleve) can also be used for pain</p>

It's been estimated that 65% of the US population has this infection (I do not have worldwide data).</p>

<p>This version of the virus is relatively benign, but it never leaves the body. It takes up residence in the roots of nerves; in the case of cold sores, it is a nerve near the cheekbone.

<p>Thrombolytic therapy (clot busting medicines e.g. tPA, also called fibrinolytics since they lyse fibrin strands of thrombi or clots) has major advantage in ease of administration. They are administered via intravenous route and hence can be give by nurses or paramedical personnel. The drug travels in the blood stream to reach arteries of the heart and lyses the thrombus (clot) there. Thrombolysis treatement can be given in ambulance while patients are being transported to hospitals or even at patient's home to save time. Tenecteplase, a type of thrombolytic therapy, can be given just as a bolus injection and does not even need infusion. Early after onset of heart attack, the thrombus is soft and possibly smaller in size and hence is more easily lysed by thrombolytic agents.</p>

<p>On the other hand, primary angioplasty needs a fully functioning cardiac catheterization laboratory which costs a lot and are available only in tertiary centers. Trained cardiologists and cath lab technician/nursing staff are needed to perform primary angioplasty. The access has to be through high pressure artery rather than simple vein for thrombolysis. The procedure itself is very complex since the coronary arteries of the heart have to be hooked, wires, balloon catheters, thrombo-suction devices and stents have to be passed into them to open the block caused by thrombus. The logistics of availablity are difficult, especially at nights and on weekends. Hence, the costs are also much more with primary angioplasty. </p>

<p>Because of all these reasons, we should not ignore the role of thrombolytic therapy in patients presenting early after onset of chest pain in acute heart attack. For patients presenting late, primary angioplasty has been shown to be more beneficial than thrombolytic treatment, presumably because the thrombus become more extensive and firm with time and is not easily lysed wih thrombolytic agents (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12517460"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12517460</a>).</p>

","<p>What you are asking about is called <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"" rel=""nofollow"">bioavailability</a></em>, which is the term for how much of a consumed substance is actually taken up by the body, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioequivalence"" rel=""nofollow"">bioequivalence</a>, which is about whether two products are used the same way in the body.</p>

<p><strong><em>Protein</em></strong></p>

<p>For protein, bioavailability is also called <a href=""http://www.food-info.net/uk/protein/bv.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Biological Value (BV)</a>. The BV of an egg, for example is <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/AC854T/AC854T74.htm#chII.I.7"" rel=""nofollow"">somewhere around 93</a> (see column 5). For cooked chicken, <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/AC854T/AC854T74.htm#chII.I.6"" rel=""nofollow"">a bit over 70</a>. </p>

<p>It's hard to find sources for protein powder/shakes that don't seem biased (being from the manufactors of the protein, or bodybuilding sites), but here's a study from the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine: <a href=""http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Protein - Which is best?</a>. It uses an adjusted scale, where a whole egg has a biological value of 100. In that scale, since whey protein has a higher BV than whole egg, it comes out as 104. Soy protein and casein have BVs in the mid-70s, a bit lower than beef.</p>

<p>As for whether they have the same effect, well, what's different betrween different sources of protein is <em>composition</em>. Proteins are made from building blocks called amino acids, of which there are 20 in food. Many of those can be converted from one to the other or made from other things we eat, but <a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002222.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">9 amino acids are called 'essential'</a> and have to be eaten. Different foods, including protein powders differ in what amino acids they have. Usually, protein powders will contain these. How much they contain will depend on the product. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that no source of is 'perfect' in that regard, either. A bean does not have the same amino acid composition in its proteins as a human body does. Neither does whey protein. Deficiency in essential amino acids isn't pleasant, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234922/"" rel=""nofollow"">but it is rare in people who aren't generally malnutritient and  consume enough protein overall, from more than one source</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vitamins</em></strong></p>

<p>Basically, a lot of the same applies for vitamins. They aren't perfectly bioavailable when digested from food <em>or</em> from a multivitamin, sometimes one is better, sometimes the other. Answering this for all vitamins is way too broad, and it probably also depends on the product. The paper <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/269S.full"" rel=""nofollow"">Multivitamin and multimineral dietary supplements: definitions, characterization, bioavailability, and drug interactions</a> goes into a few of the problems and general concepts. </p>

<p>For example, it looks like the bioavailibility of folic acid taken up from dietery supplements <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17284745"" rel=""nofollow"">is higher than that from food</a>, and especially outperforms <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15447898"" rel=""nofollow"">spinach and yeast</a> (warning: low number of subjects in study...). For vitamin C, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847730/"" rel=""nofollow"">Synthetic or Food-Derived Vitamin C—Are They Equally Bioavailable?</a> summarizes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, all steady state comparative bioavailability studies in humans have shown no differences between synthetic and natural vitamin C, regardless of the subject population, study design or intervention used. Some pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown transient and small comparative differences between synthetic and natural vitamin C, although these differences are likely to have minimal physiological impact</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although synthetic and food-derived vitamin C appear to be equally bioavailable in humans, ingesting vitamin C as part of a whole food is considered preferable because of the concomitant consumption of numerous other macro- and micronutrients and phytochemicals, which will confer additional health benefits. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So whole foods are preferable, but the vitamin C that you get from the supplements itself isn't any better or worse than the vitamin C an apple contains, and certainly isn't unhealthy. </p>

<p>For some people, getting all vitamins they need from their diet is either impossible or very hard (vitamin D and iron deficiencies are rather common) and that's where supplements like the protein bars you use come in.  As pointed out by Atl LED in the comments, though, for vitamin supplements to work it's important to take care of how the multivitamins need to be taken. If they need to be taken with food for maximum absorption, that's important or else you won't get the full benefits. </p>

<p>If protein bars are judged as 'unhealthy' it should be because of things like their sugar content, but it's certainly not true that the proteins or vitamins in them are  unhealthy or that we can't use them at all.</p>

"What does metformin do to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome?","337","","<p>Metformin is a drug used to treat diabetes but one of its off-label uses is to treat Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. What does metformin do for someone who has PCOS but does not have diabetes? Is metformin necessary to treat PCOS?</p>
","<p>PCOS can make your body resistant to insulin. When your body's cells become too resistant to insulin, that's called type 2 diabetes. Metformin makes your body more sensitive to insulin, so it can help prevent type 2 diabetes in PCOS patients who do not yet have it.</p>

<p>Metformin doesn't treat PCOS itself, and it's not approved by the FDA to treat PCOS. Its use is appropriate when the patient shows early signs of insulin resistance, a condition called prediabetes.</p>

<p>This page has some good info: <a href=""http://youngwomenshealth.org/2014/02/25/metformin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youngwomenshealth.org/2014/02/25/metformin/</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, some physicians &amp; scientists believe that metformin can be used to treat other symptoms of PCOS. If you're interested in a critical review of those claims, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475283/"" rel=""nofollow"">see this paper</a>. Here's a key paragraph from the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of metformin in PCOS has received a lot of attention for
  obvious reasons. Once thought of as a wonder drug, the accumulating
  evidence on the efficacy of metformin has been disappointing. The lack
  of an emphatic or overwhelming efficacy is largely due to the
  patients' variability in phenotypes and their metabolic parameters.
  Some studies have tried to identify the patients that are most likely
  to benefit from metformin, yet again the results have not been
  forthcoming. Consequently the burden falls back on the clinician who
  should be familiar with the gist of the available evidence to be able
  to identify the right patient for the treatment in hand. Obtaining an
  evidence of IR [insulin resistance] is a good starting point prior to recommending its use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please keep in mind PCOS is a very heterogenous disorder, meaning that any two women can have PCOS with totally different clinical manifestations and also metabolic consequences. Not everyone will need metformin, because not everyone has the same metabolic consequences of PCOS.</p>

"Why didn't smallpox develop resistance to its vaccine?","335","","<p>Antimicrobial resistance is common. Why didn't smallpox develop resistance to its vaccine? Why was smallpox eradicable?</p>
","<p>To answer this question, first it might be useful to talk about how a vaccine actually works: basically, through introducing dead or relatively harmless (attenuated) versions of a virus or bacteria (or more recently, synthetic virus-like particles meant to mimic the outside of a virus), you induce a reaction by your immune system to defend itself.</p>

<p>As your immune system remembers pathogens it's encountered before based usually on a protein encountered on the outside of the virus or bacteria (an antigen), when it encounters the real deal, it can defend itself.</p>

<p>Which means the ability for a vaccine to work depends <em>entirely</em> on your body's ability to recognize the vaccine you were given and the pathogen you encounter as ""the same"".</p>

<p>This, in turn, is a function of how fast the virus evolves. Some viruses, like influenza, have genomes that are very conducive to swapping between strains. This is known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_shift"">antigenic shift</a>. Other viruses, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2937799/"">like HIV</a>, have relatively rapid evolution brought on by methods of copying their genomes that are ""sloppy"" or error prone. This is sometimes called antigenic drift (influenza does this as well).</p>

<p>Both of these mechanisms make it likely that, over time, the difference between the vaccine and the virus is such that your body will no longer recognize one as the other.</p>

<p>In contrast to RNA viruses like HIV and influenza, viruses that have their genomes stored as double stranded DNA, like smallpox, have <a href=""http://www.virology.ws/2009/05/10/the-error-prone-ways-of-rna-synthesis/"">much lower error rates</a>, which means antigenic drift is less of a problem, and it's not prone to antigenic shift. This means that a vaccine developed against it wasn't made ineffective by the virus evolving such that it didn't provoke an immune response (known as antigenic escape).</p>

<p>This stability made smallpox an excellent target for a vaccine, and the lack of stability is why developing a long-lasting vaccine against influenza and HIV is so difficult.</p>

"What do blood pressure readings indicate?","334","","<p>I have heard 120 by 80 is considered normal blood pressure.
What do these numbers indicate?   </p>

<p>I am not a science student. Please explain in non-complicated language.</p>
","<p>I would like to add a brief answer in common language. The heart is a pump which pushes blood into the arteries in pulsatile manner (pushes out blood with each heart beat). As the blood is pushed in the arteries, the pressure rises to a peak called systolic pressure, which is usually around 120 mm Hg. As the heart's main chamber (left ventricle) relaxes, the pressure tends to fall. But fall in pressure is arrested by closure of a valve called aortic valve. Further fall in pressure occurs by flow of blood to peripheral tissues.  The lowest limit to which the pressure falls in main arteries is called diastolic pressure and it is usually around 80 mm Hg. </p>

<p>Morever, when the blood pressure is checked with a mercury instrument, the cuff around arm is inflated to about 200 mm Hg (to occlude the flow in artery of the arm) and then slowly pressure is reduced while listening to the sounds over artery in front of the elbow joint. Knocking sounds start coming at systolic pressure (usually around 120 mm Hg). These sounds disappear as the cuff pressure is lowered below diastolic blood pressure (usually around 80 mm Hg). Hence, the BP reading is said to be 120/80.</p>

<p>The following figure from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure#Pulse_pressure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blood pressure Wikipedia page</a> should make this clearer. The notch on the downnstroke indicates point of closure of the aortic valve.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBbY8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>Edit in response to comment below: The mechanism of these sounds is not entirely clear and has been subject of study since long (see this 1929 article: <a href=""http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(29)90277-5/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(29)90277-5/abstract</a> .

It is likely to originate from the artery wall due to vibrations created by turbulent flow that occurs when blood flow is partially obstructed (ref: <a href=""https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/cardio/auscul.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/cardio/auscul.htm</a>). There is no sound when the flow is totally obstructed i.e. cuff pressure greater than systolic pressure. Also, there is no sound when cuff pressure is lower than diastolic since the flow then is laminar and not turbulent. The nature of sounds (called Korotkoff sounds) also varies as pressure is lowered from systolic to diastolic and 5 phases have been identified: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korotkoff_sounds#The_five_Korotkoff_sounds"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korotkoff_sounds#The_five_Korotkoff_sounds</a></p>

"Does the *frequency* of loud sounds one is exposed to affect Tinnitus risk?","332","","<p>I currently am trying to understand <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686891/"">Tinnitus</a> and am having issues with it, because I can't find an official source to see exactly what sort of sound frequency, if heard too often would cause the damage.</p>

<p>Does one type of frequency, if heard too often at too high volume trigger it?</p>

<p>EDIT: I know from <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/basics/causes/con-20021487"">sources that loud noise is a potential cause</a> but can't find the reference that stated a certain frequency might be to blame. This is upsetting, Internets. As far as I know, though low frequency (bass) causes Tinnitus more often than high pitched sounds.</p>
","<p>Different hairs cells in inner ear (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cochlea</a>) vibrate in various ways in respond to different sound frequencies.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yNj7.gif"" alt=""The hairs vibrate in various ways in respond to the resonance in the cochlear fluid.""></p>

<p>Small temporary changes or damages in the outer hair cells of the cochlea can trigger the emergence of tinnitus by increasing the gain of the central auditory system<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686891/#B8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2004</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Most patients (both tinnitus and hearing loss) reports that the frequency of the tinnitus correlates with the severity and frequency characteristics of their hearing loss and that intensity of the tinnitus is usually less than 10dB above the patient's hearing threshold at that frequency<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686891/#B6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2004</a></sup></p>

<p>However the risk of hearing loss is not related to specific sound frequency, but rather to sound pressure (loudness) as it's stated in the article which you linked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exposure to loud noise.</strong> Loud noises, such as those from heavy equipment, chain saws and firearms, are common sources of noise-related hearing loss. Portable music devices, such as MP3 players or iPods, also can cause noise-related hearing loss if played loudly for long periods. Tinnitus caused by short-term exposure, such as attending a loud concert, usually goes away; long-term exposure to loud sound can cause permanent damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tinnitus is one of the most important symptoms that can signal the onset of acoustic trauma.</p>

<p>Those exposed to over 85 decibels of sound continually are at a higher risk for acoustic trauma. In other words, the ear can be exposed to short periods in excess of 120dB without permanent harm (having discomfort and possibly pain), however long term exposure to sound levels over 80dB can cause permanent hearing loss<sup><a href=""https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9735"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OSHA</a></sup>.</p>

"Wearing a corset","330","","<p>First of all, I am not an english native speaker, however I will try to explain my issue as clear as possible. I am not asking for any diagnosis, but to clarify my question I will share my personal story . </p>

<p>My work needs about eight hours daily  sitting  in front of a computer. For that, trying to keep by body healthy, I start a new program, in which  I change my food habits into healthier ones, and try to do exercises three times  a week  plus taking a walk daily for  20 min.</p>

<p>However dueto stress I am still facing a problem :  I am thin, even though all fats are accumilating in the abs and waist!</p>

<p>I was thinking that, maybe wearing a coreset can prevent this accumilation of fat. So I did some research on different corsets products. 
However, what I found is that:  as many warning of wearing such corset as many  encouragings for wearing it. Maybe this  is due to commercial  facts.</p>

<p>My question is : From  medical poin of view,  Does wearing a corset has any disadvantages? What if I wear it for 8 hours a day  ?  does a corset affect the skin ( or as I read the fat under the skin ) ? </p>
","<h1>1. Does wearing a corset have any disadvantages?</h1>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>The wearing of a corset for extended periods of time to maintain or reduce waist size is called tightlacing. It is commented (though nowhere I can cite) that to effectively tightlace you need to use a Victorian-style steel/bone corset as modern elastic/rubber/plastic corsets don't exert enough force.</p>

<p>A typical tightlacing training routine begins with the use of a well-fitted corset and introduces very gradual decreases in the waist circumference. <strong>Lacing too tight too fast can cause extreme discomfort and short-term problems such as shortness of breath and faintness, indigestion, and chafing of the skin if a liner is not worn.</strong></p>

<p>The diminished waist and tight corset reduce the volume of the torso. This is sometimes reduced even further by styles of corset that force the torso to taper towards the waist, <strong>which pushes the lower ribs inwards</strong>. <strong>Internal organs are moved closer together and out of their original positions in a way similar to the way that a pregnant woman's expanding uterus causes the organs to be displaced.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The volume of the lungs diminishes and the tightlacer tends to breathe intercostally – that is, with the upper portion of the lungs only. Due to the lower portion of the lungs being used less there is often a stereotype of mucosal build-up there; a slight and persistent cough is the sign of the body trying to clear this.</strong></p>

<p>For more information on the effects on individual organs please see this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_tightlacing_on_the_body#Muscles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia Commons article</a>. </p>

<p>Feel free to google any of the above, its simple biology. You cant magically break the rules of thermodynamics or human biology by squeezing your waist.</p>

<h1>2. What if I wear it for 8 hours a day?</h1>

<p>The same as above still applies. </p>

<h1>3. Does a corset affect the skin ( or as I read the fat under the skin )?</h1>

<p>In a way, it moves it around which does 'affect' it. </p>

<p>It does not build muscle and may lead to atrophy of your abdominals due to them not being used to stabilise you (as you rely on the corset). </p>

"life expectancy for cerebral palsy (spastic diplegia)?","328","","<p>I'm a man in his 30s who has lived with mild spastic diplegia (cerebral palsy) all his life. Longevity runs in the family (all my grandparents have made it past 90 and one is working on 102). It recently occurred to me that I've never met an older person with CP, and I've started to wonder how this may or may not affect my life span.</p>

<p>Googling for this information is flat-out terrifying, since the population averages include much more severe presentations of CP than my own, so lack of mobility and difficulties with self-care significantly confound lifetime outcomes. I'm fortunate to be on the very mild end of the spectrum: muscle tightness in both lower extremities but no other involvement. I am fully independent and do not need mobility aides of any kind. Currently participating in regular PT to (successfully) counteract some increased tightness of late.</p>

<p>I realize this is a strange question to ask here, but there seems to be little information for people in my particular situation (perhaps an indication that I have nothing to worry about?). Any advice or insight from a PT or an older person living with CP would be especially appreciated.</p>
","<p>Having done more searching over the last month, I thought it might be helpful to others if I answered my own question. I came to three realizations:</p>

<p>First, this is like asking, ""Dear Google, when am I going to die?"" It's impossible to know for sure and it's unnerving to even ask.</p>

<p>Second, searching for ""older people with cerebral palsy"" on the internet is a tricky proposition. Suppose that a person is 80 today (in 2016), and living with cerebral palsy. That means he/she was born in 1936. Would a person with a mild CP impairment even have been diagnosed as such, given the social stigma? Unlikely. Would such a person be tech savvy enough to be posting on message boards? Also unlikely. Would such a person be posting <em>specifically about CP</em>? Extremely unlikely. Looking for such people is like hunting for unicorns.</p>

<p>All that said, <a href=""http://www.griswoldhomecare.com/blog/spotlight-on-cerebral-palsy-1-cerebral-palsy-and-aging/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this comment thread</a> features several older people with CP chiming in. I also found a few scattered forum posts from people in their 60s and 70s living with CP. The oldest person I was able to find was Maureen Arcand, who <a href=""http://www.wi-bpdd.org/publications/2010/OnePersonsJourneyAgingCPCollection.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">wrote extensively</a> about living with CP and lived to be 86, despite considerable mobility impairments. That's actually above the current US average life expectancy of 81.6 years for women.</p>

<p>Third, there has indeed been some research on this topic, though it can be hard to find. Hutton and Pharoah (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7284164_Life_expectancy_in_cerebral_palsy"" rel=""noreferrer"">2006</a>) distinguish between cases with and without severe impairments, and found that in cases where there were no severe impairments (i.e., able to stand and walk, able to care for oneself, no comorbid disorders such as epilepsy), survival outcomes were similar to the general population. Strauss <em>et al</em> (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2008.03000.x/asset/j.1469-8749.2008.03000.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=ityq6pbw&amp;s=b1e1bb571bed8e9a62cc9b6738df8b20b5812488"" rel=""noreferrer"">2008</a>) found that in their highest-functioning category, survival rates were slightly reduced compared to the general population, but they go on to caution that, ""if a person's pattern of disabilities is at an extreme end of the range for a given group, their life expectancy may differ substantially
from the group average."" As Hutton says in <a href=""http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/hutton/scope4.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this summary document</a>, ""A child who is mildly affected by CP can expect to have much the same length of life as
a child without CP.""</p>

<p>To sum up, for those of us fortunate enough to be on the extreme mild end of the CP spectrum, all available evidence suggests that the CP itself doesn't put a drag on our lifespans. If you go to Dr. Google, you can find CP resource websites claiming that CP ""puts extra strain on the heart"" or that people with CP ""don't build up a reserve of energy when resting"". That may be true in more moderate or severe cases, but it seems to be an unlikely risk factor for mild cases.</p>

"How is alcohol eliminated from breast milk?","316","","<p>Searching for whether it is safe to breastfeed after alcohol consumption, I found lots of pages telling me that alcohol concentration in breast milk spikes after consumption, but then decreases again afterwards, same as it does in blood. From the article <a href=""http://www.babycenter.com/0_alcohol-and-breastfeeding_3547.bc"" rel=""nofollow"">Alcohol and Breastfeeding</a> from Babycenter.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait at least two hours after you finish a drink before nursing your baby to give your body a chance to clear the alcohol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, since breast milk does not get continuously filtered by the liver like blood does, it is unclear to me how this works. Is there any scientific literature available for how the process of eliminating alcohol from breast milk works? </p>
","<p>The best reference I could find on this was <a href=""http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/350/alcohol-during-the-nursing-period-a-risk-assessment-under-consideration-of-the-promotion-of-breastfeeding.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Schwegler et al. (2013)</a>, which gave detailed descriptions of both the processes of transfer of alcohol to the bloodstream and breast milk and the effects thereafter in the mother and the infant.</p>

<p>Here is a somewhat condensed timeline of what happens.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Intake.</strong> The mother consumes an alcoholic beverage, which travels along the digestive tract from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach and intestines.</li>
<li><strong>Resorption.</strong> The alcohol (really ethanol, for all intents and purposes) is resorbed in minute quantities in cells in the esophagus, and in moderate amounts in the stomach. Most of the resorption takes place in the intestines and beyond, specifically the smaller intestines, thanks to the ""first pass effect"". The ethanol is now transferred to the bloodstream. </li>
<li><strong>Breakdown of alcohol.</strong> The ethanol is transformed into metabolite acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). ADH is more common in the liver and intestines than in the stomach, which in part accounts for the higher resorption rates in the lower part of the digestive tract. Next, the acetaldehyde undergoes oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) or monooxygenase CYP2E1. The result is acetate, which is then turned into water or carbon dioxide, as normal.</li>
<li><p><strong>Transfer from the bloodstream to breast milk.</strong> This step happens concurrently with (3). Some of the ethanol circulating in the bloodstream is transferred to breast milk along with other substances. This transfer often contains ethanol that has been resorbed from the stomach, where less ethanol is resorbed and filtered away. Additionally, acetaldehyde is generally not present in breast milk (Kesäniemi (1974) is cited on page 16). The reason for this is unknown, but it points to the absence of ADH.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that there may be little to no breakdown of alcohol in breast milk. Breakdown via ADH and ALDH would happen between resorption and transferal/lactation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Levels of alcohol in the blood and in breast milk are generally the same, thanks to diffusion between the various glands in the breasts and the bloodstream (note that there are, of course, specialized veins and arteries for the mammary glands). Diffusion out and in means that there is not a significant net gain or loss of alcohol from the breast milk.</p>

<p>One reason for different concentrations in different groups of women depends on how proteins responsible for the filtering and breakdown are released. The authors say (page 16)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To explain the observed differences during lactation, Pepino et al. (2007)
  hypothesised that increased levels of regulatory proteins are released during the breastfeeding phase and that these proteins delay the passage of the alcohol from the stomach to the small intestine and liver, thereby increasing the first pass effect. The findings were confirmed in a further study by Pepino &amp; Mennella (2008) among mothers who pumped off their milk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting that only a small amount of the total amount of alcohol makes its way unfiltered into breast milk. As <a href=""http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-3/230-234.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Menella (date unknown)</a> writes (emphasis mine),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, less than 2 percent of the alcohol dose consumed by the mother reaches her milk and blood. Alcohol is not stored in breast milk, however, but its level parallels that found in the maternal blood. <strong>That means that as long as the mother has substantial blood alcohol levels, the milk also will contain alcohol.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the key principle. Basically, there is little to no breakdown of alcohol in the mammary glands, due in part to the lack of ADH. While some enters through the bloodstream, it can diffuse out and be broken up in the normal fashion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: there are some concerns raised about my particular biometrics, so I've posted it in my profile. </p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this question is not because I want to rapidly lose weight, as I already believe I'm at a healthy weight. In a nut shell, I've seen articles indicating that fasting can have a positive effect on the body (detox, etc.. ). The articles did not touch on activity while fasting, I was wondering if there were any studies that did. </p>
","<p>Provided that you are healthy, not suffering from a cold, disease state or other suppression of the immune system, moderate exercise during fasting periods should not impact your health. For submaximal efforts, you may notice earlier fatigue, and there will be definite performance impacts the closer you get to maximal efforts.</p>

<p>Caveat: You are still introducing an artificial state (fasted), which may have health complications. I would schedule a consult with a physician and explain your plans, and have them give you a checkup with that in mind before starting this.</p>

<p>However, there will be some impact on the effective level of the exercise, and how well you are able to perform the exercise during the later parts of the fasting period. These changes include depression in max VO2 (Although this value is more of a performance predictor, not really a measurement metric), higher levels of free fatty acids (FFA's) in the blood, as well as a somewhat suppressed gluconeogenesis as well as a concurrent rise in fat based oxidation for energy.</p>

<p>What this means, is that your body will (mostly) use up all muscle and hepatic (liver) glycogen storage, and will turn to fax oxidation (ketone bodies) for fuel. There is not that much difference in the lactate/pyruvate levels during this time, suggesting that the switch is adequate to fuel performing muscles. There are other short term changes in several hormone and substrate (glycogen, pyruvate, lactate, etc) levels, but these are returned to normal after resuming normal dietary intake.</p>

<p>While not an ideal state to pursue, intermittent periods of short fasting ( &lt; 12 hours) or even up to a few days shouldn't have any health impacts, although you may notice some performance impairment.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/238/4/E322"" rel=""nofollow"">This study</a> I was able to obtain, only the first page is freely available. This took 5 obese subjects, and in a clinical setting (hospital), underwent a 3-5 week fast, with only water and vitamin supplements for health. They showed the changes described above in hormone and substrates, with a drop in VO2 max levels at the 2 and 4 week exercise marks. There was also substantial weight loss, but that is to be expected. They showed no other adverse health effects during the prolonged fast, but to emphasize, they had adequate water intake and daily vitamin and potassium supplementation.</p>

<p>Another paper <a href=""http://www.dartmouthsports.com/pdf9/2318985.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=11600"" rel=""nofollow"">available through Dartmouth Sports</a> looked at 12 hour fasting for Ramadan and the effect on athletic performance, and found that even in the limited fasting state, there is some performance impact. One passage stands out in the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An extensive review of the older literature on the effects of 
  fasting on endurance performance was published by Aragón-
  Vargas.(21)
   The conclusion of this review was that a short period 
  (24 h to 4 days) of fasting in humans resulted in a decreased 
  capacity to perform endurance exercise. In spite of a rather 
  consistent effect of fasting, however, there was no clear evi-
  dence as to the mechanism responsible for the earlier onset of 
  fatigue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is corroborated by other sections in the paper, one detailing performance impacts on cycling at 100% VO2 max level after 24 hours fast, and impacts on high intensity events such as the 100m and 800m runs. Interestingly, one section shows no difference in muscle glycogen stores in the absence of exercise during fasting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There may be some effect of a reduction in the muscle 
  glycogen store on the maximal rates of muscle glycogenol-
  ysis with a consequent loss of exercise performance dur-
  ing high-intensity exercise, but a few days of fasting in 
  the absence of exercise has little effect on muscle glycogen 
  content.(18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do postulate that because of the metabolic acidosis that starts rising with prolonged fast is part of the reason for early fatigue in exercise, which is interesting.</p>

<p>Why is this the case, and what can be done to mitigate the risks if your job requires sitting at a desk?</p>
","<p>Your body uses motion in several ways to maintain function.
One of them is called muscle milking
Muscle Milking is the process where blood is pushed back up to your heart by your muscles compressing on the veins. Since the veins have valves to ensure one-way direction, compression (usage) of the muscles causes it to move up, against gravity.</p>

<p>Lymph also piggybacks on this process to push fluid upwards, otherwise occasionally resulting in edema.</p>

<p>Movement of blood is incredibly important. It transports white blood cells to fight various infections in your body, platelets have a tendency to start clotting when blood is moving too slow for a extended period of time (however are extremely important in injuries), nutrients are carried from your intestines, oxygen is carried to cells and carbon dioxide is carried away, filtering by the kidney's, etc.</p>

<p>Another component is the the body's powerful ability to adapt. It doesn't like spending energy when it doesn't have to. Sitting for extended periods of time frequently means your heart doesn't need to be very strong. Should at some point you do need it to do more (like when you're standing or exercising) it must quickly work overtime to keep up. This invites high blood pressure, dizziness and general fatigue.</p>

<p>To push the point, imagine someone who has been bed-ridden for several weeks due to surgery, illness, etc. While in supine (lying on your back) the person may feel fine. However when sitting up the person experiences dizziness, light-headedness and occasionally nausea. Overtime, especially following exercises, the symptoms fade as the body adjusts to being in a sitting position. The same occurs when standing</p>

<p><strong>What to do</strong></p>

<p>The solution is simple. Move. Work out so that periods of inactivity are the exception and not the norm. A strong heart can handle higher level exercises and inactivity. A weak heart will have trouble with the former.</p>

<p>Also, it's the inactivity with sitting that is unhealthy. You can stand and be inactive just as well (standing desk). </p>

<p>@kevin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have heard people who, after a long flight, fainted as they get up after landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blood vessels constantly vaso dilate (get wider) and vaso constrict as needed.
Following a nights sleep, you may feel dizzy if you quickly stand up. This is because over the course of the night you were likely sitting in supine. Since only minimal pressure is needed to maintain flow in supine, the vessels can vaso dilate. </p>

<p>Upon standing or sitting, the situation changes quickly and the body is not quick enough to respond. Since the body cannot get blood to the highest point (brain) fast enough, it cannot function. Luckily, when people faint they go into a horizontal posture, rapidly providing blood to the brain again.</p>

<p>The above invites trauma of course, but the risk of trauma is less of a issue then the lack of nutrients to the brain.</p>

"First aid measures for a snake bite","306","","<p>If a person is bitten by a snake, what first aid measures should be taken to prevent the venom from spreading all over the body until the proper medical help arrives?</p>
","<p>These are the steps that you want to take:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you can see the snake, be prepared to describe it. <strong>DO NOT</strong> attempt to catch it. If you can get a quick picture with a camera/cell phone, do so.</li>
<li>Get the person out of biting distance of the snake. (Avoid getting bitten yourself)</li>
<li>Keep the person calm, with the wound below the level of the heart, preferably lying down.</li>
<li>Cover the wound with a loose sterile bandage.</li>
<li>Call Emergency Medical or take the victim to an ER. Even if the person appears healthy, toxin effects can take several hours to appear, and early intervention is always better.</li>
<li>If there is inflammation or swelling, trace around it with a pen. This can give an indication of reaction progression.</li>
<li>Removed jewelry/rings/watches as swelling can prevent removal later. (Thanks to Shublu, I had forgotten this one).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not near a civilized area (Such as hiking, backpacking, camping), several ""tried and true"" methods are not actually effective:</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cut and suck: You can introduce venom into yourself, the cutting can spread the venom further, and you risk damaging underlying muscle/organs.</li>
<li>Use ice: It doesn't prevent the spread of venom, and can cause frostbite if applied for too long</li>
<li>Electrical shocks - Ineffective and can cause burns and/or stop the heart.</li>
<li>Use alcohol - It may deaden pain, but will cause blood vessels to expand, increasing the spread of venom.</li>
<li>Use a tourniquet/constriction band - Have not proven ineffective, and can cause more tissue damage and possibly cause limb loss if left on too long.</li>
<li>Give aspirin - Aspirin is a blood thinner and can cause increase bleeding/spread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, that is a list of <strong>^^^WHAT NOT TO DO^^^</strong>.</p>

<p>The good thing about snake bites is that many bites do not actually envenom the victim, and of those that do, it may not be a full dose. Keeping calm and keeping the bite victim calm are going to be the best things you can do, as panic can cause other symptoms that may be mistakenly attributed to the snakebite.</p>

<p>Remember that children and small people are at a higher risk because of body size, as are people that are already compromised in some way health wise. Keep calm, make the victim comfortable and contact EMS or get to an ER.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000031.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">fairly comprehensive review</a> as published by the NIH (National Institute of Health, US-based entity) of the steps to take, as well as the listing of common venomous creatures encountered. My only contention is that if a person is exhibiting shock signs it recommends elevating the legs, but very often the leg is where the bite is. I would (personally, anyway) maintain a lying, neutral position in those cases.</p>

<p>However, while it recommends the use of a venom kit (Sawyer makes a very popular model) it has been <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747805"" rel=""nofollow"">shown in a study</a> that such kits failed to remove any ""venom"" from the test site.

"Why would it be necessary to take a brand name medication if a generic drug is available?","306","","<p>Many prescription pads have a way for the doctor to indicate if a brand name medication must be dispensed instead of the generic version (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription#Contents"">a line</a> where they can write something like ""brand necessary"", ""dispense as written"", or ""no substitution"").</p>

<p>Why would it be necessary to prescribe a brand name medication if a generic version is available?  According to the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/understandinggenericdrugs/ucm167991.htm"">FDA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generic drugs are required to have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the brand name product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FDA does say that ""some variability can and does occur during manufacturing"", but that applies to both generics and brand name medications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These studies compared the absorption of brand name and generic drugs into a person’s body. [...] The average difference in absorption into the body between the generic and the brand name was 3.5 percent. Some generics were absorbed slightly more, some slightly less. This amount of difference would be expected and acceptable, whether for one batch of brand name drug tested against another batch of the same brand, or for a generic tested against a brand name drug. In fact, there have been studies in which brand name drugs were compared with themselves as well as with a generic. As a rule, the difference for the generic-to-brand comparison was about the same as the brand-to-brand comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the active ingredient is the same in both the brand name medication and the generic version, then the only difference is the inactive ingredients, which by definition do not affect the efficacy of the drug.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>...the inactive ingredients, which by definition do not affect the efficacy of the drug.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They <em>can</em> however have an effect on other physiological aspects of a human body, that's why, as far as I know, there <em>can</em> be a difference between various brands or generics. </p>

<p>Answering your question:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sometimes patients have allergies towards a component of a generic (for example its colourant) in which case the doctor has a medical reasoning to pick a brand drug.</strong></li>
<li>One other reason for a doctor to prescribe a specific brand (or to
disallow others or generics) is that he has made good experience
with that specific one.</li>
<li>Another reason is that he is following
studies or guidelines which suggest or require a specific drug in
order to be compliant, which is sometimes necessary, because</li>
<li>Some health insurances only pay for the patient a certain brand drug (though they also often prefer cheaper generics, as far as I know)</li>
<li>If the health insurance pays any kind of drug, or the patient is paying on his own, then the doctor could prescribe a specific drug also because he was convinced by pharmaceutical representatives to try out new drugs they advertise</li>
<li>Also, if paid by the patient, those new drugs can be prescribed and the results could be collected (anonymously) and handed to the pharmaceutical companies (for evaluation) which in turn pay the doctor some legal compensation</li>
<li>Well and there are gifts:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>A recent letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association illustrates how effective drug advertising can be. It describes a patient who came into the hospital with an infected insect bite. The intern who first saw the patient first sensibly wanted to prescribe a nice, inexpensive penicillin, which is the drug of choice for a minor infection. But the resident overruled the intern and favored a more ""modern"" choice for this ""severely"" ill patient. He decided the patient had to have a brand-new antibiotic…at $183 a day.</p>
  
  <p>The attending physician who supervised the house officers checked into the incident. It turned out the resident had just been wined and dined by the drug representative whose company made the new antibiotic. </p>

"Are platelet donations more needed then whole blood?","304","","<p>A few months ago I showed up to donate blood and said I was willing to do any type of donation. I ended up getting dragged into donating platelets instead, which I admit I hadn't even realized was an option.  I'm trying to donate platelets more, now that I realize I can do it in between whole blood donations, though I admit I find the whole process far more annoying then whole blood.</p>

<p>However, what I find odd is how I've gotten far more pressure to come back to donate platelets then I ever did donating red blood, and the first time the clearly pushed me to donating platelets over whole blood even when I really didn't know anything about it and just going along to help out however they wanted me to.  </p>

<p>This last time I showed up I told them that I thought I was due to donate whole blood, and if so wanted to do whole blood since I didn't have time for platelets, but would donate platelets if I wasn't due for whole blood.  Again they seemed very eager to get me to donate platelets, to the point of seeming really disappointing when I ended up donating whole blood.</p>

<p>It's inconvenient, to say the least, to loose so much time multiple times a month, I'm happy to do it to help, but I'd at least like to have an idea of exactly how much I am helping when I do it.</p>

<p>So, is there a reason they seem so eager to get platelet donations?  Would it do more good to never donate whole blood and only ever do platelets?  Can anyone give me an estimation of how much good a platelet donation does <em>on average</em> (not the best case, but the average case of each donation from a B+ donor)? </p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>To try to make this easier I finally sat down and tried to answer another question of mine: <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1289/how-many-lives-are-saved-from-one-donation-of-blood/3909#3909"">how many &#39;lives&#39; are saved from one donation of blood?</a>  See my answer to it.  The numbers are not guaranteed by me, I am a layman who doesn't really know much about the medicine behind the statistics I looked up, but it may give an answer some basis for comparison of the two options; <em>IF</em> they assume any of my numbers are right.</p>
","<p>I don't know if anyone can give a definite answer as to why <em>these</em> folks so badly wanted you to donate platelets over whole blood, but there are many possible reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Platelets give you more bang for your buck.</strong> According to <a href=""http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/types-donations"" rel=""nofollow"">the American Red Cross</a>, one session of platelet apheresis can collect enough platelets for one or two transfusions. On the other hand, it can take anywhere from four to six donations of whole blood to get the same amount of platelets.</li>
<li><strong>Platelets are always needed, at high rates.</strong> The first point is important, because those who use platelets often use them in bulk (some organ transplant patients need up to 30 units worth<sup>1</sup> - see <a href=""http://www.universityhealthsystem.com/plateletpheresis/"" rel=""nofollow"">a page from University Health System</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Platelets have a short shelf life.</strong> <a href=""http://bca.coop/products-services/blood-products/platelets/"" rel=""nofollow"">Blood Centers of America</a> states that even with some processing, platelets need to be transfused within about five days after the donation, meaning that waiting can cause the loss of an entire donation. There is a constant need for refills (for lack of a better word). Even this narrow window has been modified in the past, shrinking or growing (see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21517896"" rel=""nofollow"">Sireis et al. (2011)</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Platelets are used for cancer patients.</strong> The <a href=""https://www.mskcc.org/about/get-involved/donating-blood/faqs-donating-blood-platelets/platelet-donations"" rel=""nofollow"">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> says that patients who are suffering from leukemia or have just had a bone marrow transplant may have low platelet levels. The transfusions can be essential - life-saving.</li>
<li><strong>People might not like donation platelets.</strong><sup>[Citation needed!]</sup> This one is a complete guess on my part, but platelet donation can take a long time, as you said. People are averse to donating blood for many reasons; as you stated, the long donation session for platelets only makes this worse. You've shown that you were willing in the past to go through with this, so the blood donation center probably thinks that you're more likely to do it again.</li>

","<p>There's a number of medical reasons to take the pill other than preventing pregnancy : </p>

<ul>
<li>Regulating menstruation to avoid having irregular, overly frequent, overly abundant or painful periods, as well as premenstrual syndrome</li>

<p>Edited because I did in fact understood birth control pills and not prenatal supplementation.</p>

<p>As a vitamin supplementation, it could in theory be used by people who lack certain nutrients, namely folic acid and iron (iron deficiency in particular is common in people who are menstruating). However, the Mayo Clinic doesn't recommend it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, if you're not pregnant and not planning to become pregnant, high levels of certain nutrients over a long period of time may actually be more harmful than helpful.</p>

I have WBC and Platelets counts of over 3000 people with varying age and gender. I was thinking about doing a Hypothesis test. But since I don't know WHY THE WBC/Platet count matters, I cannot proceed.</p>

<p>If anybody have come across any research claims about any disease or conditions that relate to blood count ratios ( in my case, WBC/platelet), please share.</p>
","<p>The WBC to platelet ratio is not a commonly used index in medicine, and does not have any general significance.

The rationale behind this is that trauma patients often have a high WBC count (leukocytosis due to stress demargination of neutrophils), such that the WBC count is no longer reliable as an indicator of infection. Therefore, this study combined the WBC count with the platelet count, which initially goes down in most patients with infection <a href=""http://jintensivecare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2052-0492-1-9"" rel=""nofollow"">[3]</a>, to try to improve discrimination between the two conditions.

"Which are the effects of removing sugars from a balanced diet for an otherwise healthy person","291","","<p>What effects would removing sugars from a balanced diet have on an otherwise healthy person have? I've heard that both refined and natural sugars can have a negative impact in the body. Is it safe to stop consuming sugars all together?</p>
","<p>Firstly, removing all <strong>added</strong> sugars from you diet certainly will improve your general health in the long term due to the decreased risk of diabetes: your blood glucose level will be more stable with less variability and your diet will include less ""empty calories"". In order to endure in work, in hobbies, in exercise and in day to day living does not rewuire added sugar in a diet. They are bad.</p>

<p>Removing <strong>carbohydrates</strong> from your diet may have some negative impact but not necessarily. Classic low carb diets recommend to remove all substances with a high glycemic index (GI) from your diet. The higher the GI, the faster your blood glucose level will rise when digesting the food. White bread or white rice are examples of foods with a high GI value. In the very extreme, a low carb diet may result in ketosis, which means that your body will get slightly acidic and all your energy consumption is due to burning fat. Removing all carbohydrates stops the citric acid cycle inside cells and this results in the formation of ketone substances which are acidic.</p>

<p>Ketosis may improve your weight loss by burning fat more efficiently. However there are considerable between-subject variations in this. Low carb diets and subsequent ketosis may result in nausea, headaches and general illness. Not all people  tolerate low carb diets or ketosis.</p>

<p>If you perform long duration exercises I can´t recommend removing high GI  substances from your diet. Skeletal muscles need a lot of energy  while doing long duration exercises. The most important energy storage is muscle glycogen. This is consumed in long duration exercises, and after it runs out the body starts to use fats and proteins. Foods with a high GI value are important to restore your muscle glycogen storages after exercise. Therefore removing, say, white rice from your diet won´t be good for exercise if they are usually long duration. Interval or strength training is a different issue. It is also important to note that even a long day at work may be similar to long duration exercise. How well your body does tolerate the lack of your muscle glycogen, is very depending on your general health and fitness.</p>

"Basic CPR practice without a dummy","288","","<p>I would like to practice basic CPR with my children, but do not want to invest in a CPR doll.  I would be interested in suggestions as to how else one could do this.  My idea was to practice the bits which are not dangerous with a person and to substitute a firm cushion (or several, to get a feeling for different resistance levels) for the actual pressing, with another at the top for the head.  I suspect there must be something better though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the above answer is all based on my guessing; but seems like it would be fun to experiment with. However, the below answer and link will give you instructions to make a DIY manikin that a CPR instructor has made and uses. </p>

<p>You mention having the children practice some skills on a human. As long as they are old enough to understand the concept of not actually doing these skills on a person who doesn't need them, I encourage you to teach them on a human. Teach them the anatomical landmarks, how to check for breathing and a pulse and how to open an airway(1) on a real person. </p>

An open-labeled randomized controlled trial was conducted on 290 patients between the ages of 18 and 60 years with platelet counts ≤100,000/μL. The patients were confirmed to be suffering from dengue using a rapid dengue bedside test. Patients in the intervention group were administered fresh juice from 50 g of C. papaya leaves once a day 15 min after breakfast for 3 consecutive days. In addition, they received the standard treatment for dengue. The controls only received the standard treatment. The final analysis was conducted on 111 patients from the intervention group and 117 controls. The study found that there was a significant increase in the platelet counts in the intervention group at the end of 40 h when compared to the counts 8 h after the intervention began. This significant increase was not observed in the control group. An increase in arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase and the platelet-activating factor receptor gene expression was also observed in the intervention group.

The general expert consensus is that to be considered ""possible lupus,"" you need at least one criteria plus at least two other features that may be associated for, but are not specific for SLE <a href=""https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults"" rel=""nofollow"">[1]</a>.

<li>Glomerular hematuria (blood and protein in urine seen under microscope)</li>
<li>Pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (shortness of breath, coughing up blood, abnormal pulmonary function tests, abnormal chest CT scan, abnormal heart echo)</li>
<li>Myocarditis (chest pain, shortness of breath, abnormal heart echo), verrucous endocarditis (complex manifestations, diagnosed on heart echo)</li>

<p>Note that all of these symptoms are extremely non-specific and <em>all</em> have causes that are much more common than those listed above, e.g. the overwhelming majority of patients with headaches <em>and</em> abdominal pain <em>and</em> shortness of breath do not have lupus, since those are all symptoms commonly experienced by the general population.</p>

<p>To answer your questions: yes, ""borderline lupus"" (possible lupus) is a real thing. Further tests to rule out probable lupus would include a complete physical exam; complete blood count; urinalysis; anti-DNA, anti-Smith, and antiphospholipid antibodies; complement levels; and a direct Coombs test. </p>

","<p>I am focusing on one important health issue with respect to sleep position. Obstructive sleep apnea or apnoea (OSA) is a common condition where person has excessive snoring and disturbed sleep at night. These persons may also have headaches in the morning, daytime sleepiness, chronic fatigue or exhaustion, impaired functioning and emotional disturbances. Many expensive therapies are available but adjusting sleep position is an inexpensive method that may help greatly. Sleeping on the side (and not on the back) is recommended for this. Sleeping on the back causes the tongue to fall back and obstruct the airway, producing snoring and other features of sleep apnea syndrome. Extra pillows, as a pillow between the knees, may be used to get comfortable in this position. </p>

<p>Very true; so easy that it's often an outpatient procedure.</p>

<p>""Strapping"" (or belting) hernias has been done in one form or another for centuries. It's fine for people who have relatively small hernias that are asymptomatic. However, it's not a cure. The separation of the abdominal wall muscle is permanent (it's caused by either an inherent weakness at birth, and/or repetitive stress).</p>

<p>For inguinal hernias, watchful waiting (deferring surgery until it's necessary due to pain or other symptoms) is a perfectly acceptable way to ""treat"" hernias. Though there is considerable crossover to surgery, in one study, men have been watched for more than 11 years without any mortality and only 2 emergency repairs in a group of 254 men with inguinal hernias. The limitations are on lifting, activities, diet, constipation and other factors; many of the hernias become more painful with time.</p>

"Does sugar cause children to become hyperactive?","276","","<p>When I was younger, I was told not to have too much sugar (candy, soda, ice cream - anything sweet really) because I would get too hyper and I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I never really felt very affected by sugar, but I have seen people that I do think get affected by sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Does sugar cause <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003256.htm"">hyperactivity</a> in children? If so, how much is too much?</strong></p>
","<p>This is a hot topic, and I don’t think there is a firm consensus in the child psychiatry world about the answer. I think a good summary of the literature would leave you with: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>X, Y, and Z studies showed an association; Χ, Ψ, and Ω studies showed no association.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent. Ιn lieu of that, I'm going to use one study to illustrate a couple methodological points to show you <em>why</em> this answer is difficult to know. My goal is to help the reader develop a skeptical eye when research of this type is presented.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21779528/"">One study</a> used teacher questionnaires about hyperactivity symptoms and student questionnaires about dietary habits to see if a relationship existed between high sugar intake and hyperactivity. They found that children were at statistically higher risk for ADHD if they consumed:  </p>

<ul>
<li>less sugar from fruit snacks  </li>
<li>low Vitamin C </li>
</ul>

<p>However, the total simple sugar intake did <em>not</em> correlate with hyperactivity symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>This makes very little sense.</strong> Why should fruit snacks be different from other sugar, and where did Vitamin C come from?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics""><strong>Statistical noise</strong></a>. Data interpretation relies on a <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=jHe6dsZLGcMC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=david+katz+signal+to+noise+ratio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KDopVbTpNsHHsQSs5oHgCA&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20katz%20signal%20to%20noise%20ratio&amp;f=false"">ratio of signal:noise</a> to find the signal (in this case, an association). A 5-second brainstorm will bring to mind dozens of unrelated (to usual dietary patterns) topics that may affect what students write down on questionnaires: literacy, gender, upbringing, vocabulary, organization, memory, day-of-the-week, recent holidays, who won the Red Sox game, etc. etc. etc. Some of these may reflect recent dietary patterns that skew the memory of <em>usual</em> dietary patterns; others simply affect the accuracy of report. One could generate an equally diverse list of factors that may affect teacher reports. Either way, the result is the same: a noisy signal.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.biostathandbook.com/confounding.html""><strong>Confounding</strong></a>. A <em>confound</em> exists when an extraneous factor exists that correlates with both the independent (dietary report) and the dependent (inattentiveness) variable. In this case, one could imagine that students who tend to be careless about reporting might also be those displaying symptoms of hyperactivity (which tends to run with inattentiveness). It’s not obvious whether that would lead to <em>under</em> or <em>over</em> reporting of sugar intake. </p>

<p>Generally, obvious confounders can be adjusted for statistically (here, I don't see that they did much of that, although they did do separate analyses for boys vs girls). However, no amount of math can adjust for factors that aren’t measured. There was no “carelessness independent of hyperactivity” score obtained here, and we couldn’t expect it &mdash; it’s a basically unknowable parameter. Certain confounders are inherent to the methodology. Math never fixes this.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.biostathandbook.com/multiplecomparisons.html""><strong>Multiple comparisons</strong></a>. The basic principle is: if you look at enough factors, <em>something</em> is going to be statistically associated with something else <strong>for reasons that have nothing to do with reality.</strong> That’s because we define statistical significance as a result that would occur by chance &lt;5% of the time. If you run 20 tests, you have a good chance of coming up with one of them that appears to be positive simply by chance. In data that has a low signal:noise ratio (see #1), this problem is all the more apparent. This is something to think about when unexpected results pop up from a study that was designed to look at something completely different. Vitamin C??!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please note: this is not meant to be (primarily) a critique of this particular study. My goals here were to help the reader understand: </p>

<li>Why do I find different answers to this question every time I do a google search?   </li>

"Is there a vault somewhere that contains vials of ALL the diseases? Even the eradicated ones?

Is it for the purposes of creating vaccinations if there were ever outbreaks again? Like if there was another rinderpest outbreak, yaws outbreak, or a cholera outbreak, etc? </p>

<p>Would it be similar to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault? Except instead of storing seeds (in case of natural disasters), it stores diseases? Or is this unethical and controversial because it means human error can accidentally or intentionally releases diseases out into the public again? </p>
","<p>Apparently, from my research it's only the small-pox virus that is presently being stored.</p>

<p>But still, the find was disturbing because for decades after smallpox was declared eradicated in the 1980s, world health authorities believed the only samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia.</p>

<p>There is a vaccine against smallpox that was a key tool in the eradication of the disease. This vaccine does not contain the variola virus which causes smallpox, but a closely related virus called vaccinia. When this vaccine is given to humans, it protects them against smallpox. However, it may have rare, but serious side effects, which in extreme cases can be fatal. Since smallpox was eradicated, the vaccine is not recommended in routine immunization. It is used to protect researchers who work on the variola virus that causes smallpox and other viruses in the same virus family (known as orthopox viruses). It could also be used to protect anyone else judged to have a high risk of exposure to smallpox. </p>

<p>Vaccination with the vaccinia virus as a protection against smallpox is not recommended for widespread use. No government gives or recommends the vaccine routinely since it can cause serious complications, and even death. It should be given only to those persons who have a high risk of coming into contact with the virus which causes smallpox, or who have been exposed.</p>

"Time needed for vitamin B6 to reach the brain","269","","<p>If you  take 250 mg of vitamin B6 orally as film-coated tablets, how long does it take until the greatest portion of it reaches the brain? When does the peak occur and how does the substance spread? Are there easy ways to extend this time by one hour by e.g. eating or drinking?</p>

<p>EDIT: Some words on my motivation. I'm trying to do the experiment described at the 
<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"">Wiki</a> page on Vitamin B6, which says that B6 increases the ability for dream recall. </p>
","<p>The medical way to ask your question is ""What are the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pharmacokinetics</a> of pyridoxine (B6 version that you're likely to take)?""</p>

<p>Then that brings us to both <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8598418"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">primary</a> and <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/ppa/pyridoxine-hydrochloride-b6.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">secondary</a> <a href=""http://www.robholland.com/Nursing/Drug_Guide/data/monographframes/P100.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sources</a>, along with <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb28043.x"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a good animal model study</a>.</p>

<p>""The greatest portion reaches the brain"" will likely be shortly after the peak serum concentration, or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmax_%28pharmacology%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cmax</a>.  The amount of time it takes for a drug to get to Cmax is Tmax.   There is going to be some variability in Tmax based on age, sex, weight, diet, and B6 formulation.  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8229700"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A comparison</a> of two formulations directly found a range of 1.25 to 1.44h, which is a little tighter of the general range of 1-2 hours.</p>

<p>I didn't find a source that showed peak concentrations in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CNS tissue</a> or that looked at the delay in B6 crossing the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blood brain barrier</a> (which it will readily given its solubility), but there is little reason to suspect that it is too delayed thereafter.  <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb28043.x"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Animal studies</a> have shown that the vast majority (80-90%) of B6 is stored in muscles and the liver, so even though the peak concentration for the CNS will follow Cmax, most of the B6 will not end up there.</p>

<p>Your next two questions are mostly implicitly answered in the first question.  The peak and greatest portion are likely to be very close together (I couldn't find any evidence of delayed metabolism in the CNS).  But expanding on your third question a little, it gets there via the blood, which is pretty standard for most drugs/nutrients/vitamins in humans.  As far as taking it from swallowing the pill, it then continues along the digestive tract to the small intestine.  Mostly in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jejunum</a>, but somewhat in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ileum</a> (2nd and 3rd part of small intestine) it passively diffuses into the blood, where it circulates through the heart and eventually to your brain.</p>

<p>Eating more food may prolong the time the pill is in the stomach, thereby delaying the time that the B6 is absorbed in the small intestine.  Generically this is called gastric emptying, and an approachable site on the subject can be found <a href=""http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/emptying.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  Even though I'm pretty sure this is made up data to estimate the point, I think it's worth duplicating their time graph:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGyg7.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGyg7.gif"" alt=""%meal in stomach vs time""></a></p>

<p>I would like to point out, that this is not something that you will be able to time on a stopwatch and fine tune.  Any of these values could easily vary by an hour.  I also want to point out that taking high doses of B6 can be habit forming, and that the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11883552#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study on dreaming</a> cited in the wiki is far from convincing.  Further it was published in a relatively <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/journal/0031-5125_Perceptual_and_Motor_Skills"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">low impact journal</a>.  I'm not saying it isn't true, but I don't like the idea of people super dosing B6 for recreational dream use.</p>

"Is it okay to make a child drink alcohol when they have a cold?","267","","<p>I've seen a few people make their child drink alcohol when they have a cold. They believe that it can reduce the cold and cough. Is that true? If so, what is the right amount of alcohol the child can consume? In the case of my question, the child is 9 years old.</p>
","<p>The right amount is none. Not at all. Don't do it. Don't even consider it.</p>

<p>There have been multiple studies on alcohol and brain development, quite a few of them on teens, as they are one of the higher risk groups. All of these show significant impacts on brain and social development. There are fewer on the young child (non infant) as they are not considered a risk group. More studies in that area look at the effect of the adults consumption around them.</p>

<p>However, studies such as <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074183299090070S"" rel=""nofollow"">this one on postnatal rats</a> show that even a single day of alcohol exposure is enough to affect brain weight and development in the postnatal period. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0741832994900566"" rel=""nofollow"">This study</a> also suggests that once the brain is formed, and going through differentiation (The process by which cells become specialized for their various functions) alcohol has a greater impact than when it is forming in utero.</p>

<p>In short, children should not be given alcohol for any reason. There are now warnings about such medications as cough syrups to not use them for any children under 4, as well as warnings about alcohol in formulas for older kids. I encourage you to read the labels, and choose non alcohol formulas if you do choose to administer cough syrup.</p>

"Is there any proof that acupuncture is an effective pain remedy?","267","","<p>I have heard of acupuncture being used for pain management. Are there clear scientific proofs that indicate it is more effective than a placebo treatment for pain?  If so what types of pain has it been shown to effective for? </p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>Current research seems to indicate that the brain is responding to anticipation or visual stimulus of needles being inserted, not that any of the theories supporting acupuncture are correct.</p>

<hr>

<p>Steven Novella <a href=""http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/phantom-acupuncture/"">reviewed the following article</a>:</p>

<p>Chae Y, Lee IS, Jung WM, Park K, Park HJ, Wallraven C. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681621"">Psychophysical and neurophysiological responses to acupuncture stimulation to incorporated rubber hand.</a> Neurosci Lett. 2015 Feb 11;591C:48-52. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2015.02.025. </p>

<p>I'm going to quote from Novella's review because it's easier for a lay person to read/understand, and I don't have full access to the paper.</p>

<p>As background, he states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There have been in total several thousand clinical studies looking at the apparent effects of acupuncture. These have failed to convincingly reject the null hypothesis, meaning that they have not demonstrated a clear biological response to acupuncture for any indication. The better controlled studies consistently show that needle location does not matter (sham acupuncture), and that needle insertion does not matter (placebo acupuncture). You can literally have a non-acupuncturist randomly poke someone with toothpicks and get the same response as the full acupuncture treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And described the current paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A recent study looked at performing acupuncture on a phantom limb.
  They used a now well-established technique of tricking the brain into
  incorporating a dummy body part as if it were real. They placed
  subjects in front of a table so that one of their arms was below the
  table, with a rubber arm above the table placed in such a way that
  visually the rubber arm looked like their own arm. They then stroke
  the rubber arm and the subjects real arm simultaneously. The brain
  sees and feels the rubber arm being stroked, and this sensory feedback
  is often enough for the brain to create the sensation of ownership
  over the rubber arm.</p>
  
  <p>The researchers then placed acupuncture needles into the rubber arm
  that subjects had incorporated as their own. Obviously there is no
  possibility of any physiological response from the needle penetrating
  the rubber arm. I further think it is reasonable to conclude that
  placing a needle into a rubber arm cannot activate acupuncture points
  (if they existed) or alter Qi (if it existed). This experiment nicely
  eliminates local physiological responses and any Qi responses to the
  needles.</p>
  
  <p>The researchers performed functional MRI scanning (fMRI) on subjects
  while needles were placed in their phantom rubber limbs. Keep in mind
  that fMRI research involves collecting lots of data and aggregating
  it. So the researchers are not looking at brain reactions in real
  time, just the aggregate brain activity of many subjects over many
  trials. They then look for statistical associations in the activity.</p>
  
  <p>What they found was the same brain activation that previous studies
  have found with acupuncture of real limbs.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>When the rubber hand was fully incorporated with the real body,
    acupuncture stimulation to the rubber hand resulted in the experience
    of the DeQi sensation as well as brain activations in the dorsolateral
    prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, secondary somatosensory cortex
    (SII), and medial temporal (MT) visual area. The insular activation
    was associated with the DeQi sensation from the rubber hand.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>If these results hold up, this implies that the brain is simply
  responding to the expectation and visualization of the needle
  penetration. Actual needle penetration is unnecessary. The most
  parsimonious interpretation of this data is that acupuncture is all in
  the mind. There is no need to hypothesize the existence of Qi,
  acupuncture points, or a specific physiological mechanism for
  acupuncture.</p>
  
  <p>There are plenty of studies that show that the perception of pain is
  easily manipulated by simple things such as distraction. Swearing,
  distorting body image, and crossing your arms while one of them is
  pricked will all reduce pain perception. Pain perception is closely
  tied to attention, and so simple distraction is effective. It’s no
  surprise, therefore, that the brain responds to phantom stimulation.</p>
  
  <p>At the very least this study demonstrates that all prior studies
  looking at fMRI responses to acupuncture needle insertion were likely
  simply showing a non-specific brain response to the expectation and/or
  visualization of needle insertion, without the need to invoke any
  specific physiological responses.</p>

"Topical nifedipine cream and hypotension","267","","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifedipine"">Nifedipine</a> usually is used against high blood pressure. </p>

<p>Can the topical cream applied anally also cause hypotension? </p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a684028.html"">Nifedipine</a> is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydropyridine"">dihydropyridine</a> calcium channel blocker. As you point out, it is used via oral administration for treatment of hypertension. Its effects are mediated primarily by blocking <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-type_calcium_channel"">voltage-dependent calcium channels</a> in the walls of systemic vasculature, causing vasodilation. This has the effect of lowering blood pressure. </p>

<p>Your question, then, rests on  whether the nifedipine applied topically to the anus will reach the calcium channels in the vasculature. This is: <strong>is topical nifedipine systemically absorbed to a clinically relevant extent?</strong> </p>

<p>The answer, based on the research I can find, is no. This was explored directly in a study<sup>1</sup>: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17163278"">Serum levels and possible haemodynamic effects following anorectal application of an ointment containing nifedipine and lignocaine : a study in healthy volunteers.</a> The authors used 3 g of an ointment containing 0.3% w/w<sup>2</sup> nifedipine, applied twice daily for 7 days. Serum levels of nifedipine were below the below the limits of quantification, consistent with therapeutically negligible concentrations. Mean blood pressure was not changed when compared to baseline.</p>

"Should I see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?","266","","<p>I am 20 years old and at the uni now. I have never seen any kind of professional advisor, because I thought I could cope with my problems, until recently. I post it here, because somebody might be in a similar situation seeking help, too.</p>

<p>I was a shy, introverted guy at primary school and in college, and still am. I did not and do not drink alcohol at all, though am planning to have a nice first beer with my brother. Maybe it could have allowed me to relax in the past and party/make other people know me more, I do not know. I am not sure how relevant this may be, but my parents divorced 14 years ago. My brother was in his teens when that occured and he was devastated but I also endured a kind of a breakdown around a similar age as he did. My brother moved out very early. I stayed with my mother who has got a hell of a lot insecurities and I would often sink in her problems and try to fix her relationship with her parents (my mom is a teacher (working) and her parents also are (retired)). When I was 15, I had such a row with my mother that I almost fainted and an ambulance would take me. I moved out from her to her parents, which futher worsened their relation. This is sad to state, but I would rather confide in and trust a random person than anyone from my family, which is one of the reasons why I post this question here.</p>

<p>I am considered a mature, wise and intelligent person but I have trouble getting along with people, especially with women. I feel as though they can feel the bad vibe the second they see me and do not want to continue discussion, not saying of going on a date. I do not want to blame my mother, but I am inclined to believe it has taken some toll on me, because I can not stay with her for longer than 2-3 hours. We would talk normally, but after some time something inside of me would tell me to flee. I feel very sorry for her, and regret having told her about how I have felt about this, but she was pushing me to tell her why I had felt the way I had.</p>

<p>At school, I have always felt alone even though I had friends. Things like being chosen last on PE lessons would not bother me much then, but such relatively small nuisances are now re-emerging and cumulating.</p>

<p>Now, at the university, I have problems concentrating and can not put up with sad emotions, that is too much for me. I am afraid I will not make it to the 4th semester, and am even more afraid to tell my parents about it. Simple tasks are becoming overwhelmingly difficult to such an extent that I refrain from attending classes because I see no point in me going to them. I used to vent bad emotions by crying and I was used to it, because it seemed to have worked, at least for some time. But now, I can see it is deepening and last two times I felt I was a danger to myself.</p>

<p>I thought I was tough enough to get over this, but I feel that that strength is diminishing. At times I feel completely detached from my closest relatives, as though no bonds ever really existed.

Having written all this for some background I want to ask you, whether I should see a psychologist or go straight to a psychiatrist.</p>
","<p>As going through your question, you show your inner feelings. So it is better you to go with <strong>""Psychologist""</strong>.  </p>

<p><em>Psychiatrist is a medical doctor, he or she has the knowledge and training to evaluate underlying medical problems or drug effects that could cause emotional or behavioral symptoms.</em> </p>

<p>Whereas Psychologist deals with mental health. <strong>Psychologists have a doctoral degree in an area of psychology, the study of the mind and human behavior.</strong> They’re not medical doctors. A psychologist can have a PhD in philosophy or a PsyD in clinical or counseling psychology. Typically, they do 1-2 years of internship. Unlike psychiatrists, psychologists are also trained in giving psychological tests (like IQ tests or personality tests).</p>

<p>""A psychiatrist is concerned with the patients well-being, however, their focus is primarily towards disorders such as a chemical imbalance, whereas a psychologist primary focus is on the patients thoughts, feelings and general mental health.""</p>

"Facial hair hygiene recommendations","265","","<p>What is the best way to stop beard dandruff? </p>

<p>I wash my face regularly with Detol anti-bacterial soap, and for my hair and beard, I use a wide range of Pantene Pro-V products for my hair and beard (such as Repair and Protect, Sleek and Smooth) and conditioner. However, after a day or so I get itchy skin and dandruff.</p>

<p>Am I possibly using the wrong conditioner/shampoo for my beard and is there an alternative?</p>
","<p>There are a few other active ingredients you could try for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis), if that's what's causing your problem. Keep in mind that it <strong>might</strong> actually be a different problem, such as eczema or scalp psoriasis. From a quick internet search, the active ingredient in ""Dettol Anti-bacterial Soap"" is cholroxylenol, is that correct? If so, here are some others you might want to try (i.e. read the product label and look for one of the active ingredients below).</p>

<p>Note, these are ""over-the-counter"" options only (avaliable without a prescription). A doctor can prescribe other treatments that might not be listed below, or in a stronger formulation than what's available over-the-counter.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>pyrithione zinc</strong>: usually found in dandruff shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders; also available in a soap/cleanser form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>selenium sulfide</strong>: usually found in dandruff shampoos like Selsun Blue; it's also available in topical forms, but that may require a prescription.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ketoconazole</strong>: this is an antifungal ingredient found in anti-dandruff shampoos such as Nizoral shampoo (and generic store-brand equivalents) containing 2% ketoconazole. Stronger formulations are available by prescription. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>coal tar</strong>: usually found in dandruff shampoos like Neutrogena T-Gel or Denorex; also available in soap form; >> NOTE: this stuff has a strong ""unique"" smell... make sure you can tolerate the smell before using it. :)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>salicylic acid</strong>: usually in found in certain facial cleansers (often with the term ""oil-free acne cleanser""); it's also found in some dandruff shampoos for ""flaky scalp"" (like Neutrogena T-Sal), so it's not necessarily just for acne.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You might also consider taking a break from using the Pantene products in contact with your face, and switch to something &lt;&lt;<strong>without</strong>>> a lot of moisturizers, and not containing silicone (that's usually what the ""shine"" ingredient is). </p>

<p>This might sound silly, but you could also try ""baby shampoo"" (fragrance/moisturizer free) for a while, particularly if you're alternating with the medicated shampoos as directed on their label. </p>

<p>One ""last resort"" option in this case might be to shave your beard (omg!), and see if that helps. You may be reluctant to try that, but remember you can always grow it back later. Howecer, if you do shave the beard and the condition resolves itself, it may be time to rethink the beard. :(</p>

<p>If none of those work, it's probably best to see a doctor about it. They would be able to prescribe something more specific. They may end up prescribing something with one of those ingredients above, but in a higher strength. Alternatively, they might prescribe a topical steroid anti-inflammatory for you to use for a period of time, in case it's <strong>not</strong> dandruff and is actually something like eczema.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!!</p>

"What are pros and cons of different approaches to aborting ventricular tachycardia?","263","","<p>Idiopathic (or spontaneous, unknown origin) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"" rel=""nofollow"">ventricular tachycardia</a> is a type of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that occurs in patients with structurally normal hearts. I would like to know what the pros and cons are of the three main corrective actions physicians seem to prefer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verapamil"" rel=""nofollow"">Verapamil</a>: This seems like the drug of choice, but it tends to cause a drop in blood pressure (BP). If the patient already has a low BP (even if merely because of being young and fit), providers may be reluctant to give this drug fearing a significant drop in BP.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiodarone"" rel=""nofollow"">Amiodarone</a>: This is a drug with significant toxicity that stays in your system for a long time (<em>weeks to months</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"" rel=""nofollow"">Defibrillation</a>: Assuming the patient returns to normal rhythm after the treatment and is not conscious when delivered, it seems to have less side effects than the drugs. I have looked around and have not found any negative long term side effects, but short term (<em>seconds to minutes</em>) there are some risks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My research so far is inconclusive on what the least harmful long term impact of the three are. I am pretty sure Amiodarone should be a last choice, but unsure about the other two. </p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of these treatment options that a patient diagnosed with idiopathic VT should understand?</p>
","<p><strong>Please see the following society guidelines first:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/10/1088.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>●There is evidence and/or general agreement supporting RF ablation in
  patients with symptomatic idiopathic VT that is drug-refractory, or in
  such patients who are intolerant of drugs or do not desire long-term
  drug therapy.</p>
  
  <p>●The weight of evidence and/or opinion supports the use of beta
  blockers and/or calcium channel blockers for the treatment of
  symptomatic idiopathic VT.</p>
  
  <p>●The weight of evidence and/or opinion supports the use of class IC
  antiarrhythmic drugs as an alternative to or in combination with beta
  blockers and/or calcium channel blockers for the treatment of
  symptomatic idiopathic VT that arises from the RVOT. Subsequently, the
  2009 European Heart Rhythm Association/Heart Rhythm Society (EHRA/HRS)
  expert consensus statement recommended catheter ablation in the
  following patients with idiopathic VT and without structural heart
  disease [86]:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Severely symptomatic patients with monomorphic VT. </li>
  <li>Monomorphic VT in patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs are not
  effective, not tolerated, or not desired.  </li>
  <li>Patients with recurrent sustained polymorphic VT and VF (electrical storm) that is refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy when
  there is a suspected trigger that can be targeted for ablation</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Medical (non-interventional/ablative) management is what is recommended-- especially verapamil or a beta blocker as they are easy to take (pills), and have a pretty nice side effect profile.  You can easily find the adverse effects online but they would primarily have to do with heart rate and blood pressure and those are easily monitored.</p>

<p>Ablation is a procedure a cardiology electrophysiologist would do in the ""cath lab.""  This would be in conjunction with an ""EP Study"" which is an electrophysiology study of the heart to try to find the culprit location that starts the arrythmia.  Ablation is sometimes used (see above) in medical-refractory cases.</p>

<p>You can consider amiodarone or other antiarrythmics but they have more side effects.  Amiodarone is known to have a very long half life and a long list of side effects which require chronic monitoring (thyroid issues, lung issues, etc.) which is why they are not really first line usually in these cases though can be added on to the first line agents mentioned above.</p>

<p><strong><em>As an aside:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cardioversion, per the roots of the word, is changing/turning the direction of the heart--> You can think of this as changing the rhythm.</li>
<li>Defibrillation is a <strong>subset</strong> of cardioversion where it is done without any synchronization in cases of ventricular <strong>fibrillation</strong>.  Defibrillation = Asynchronous cardioversion</li>
<li>Many medical providers use the term cardioversion in cases of only supraventricular or ventricular <strong>tachycardia</strong> (in this case usually synchronous)
<strong>- Cardioversion, as it is changing the rhythm of the heart (electrical or chemical), includes defibrillation but usually is used as a term specific to supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia as defibrillation is more specific when cardioversion is used in ventricular fibrillation.</strong></li>

"Is it bad to eat fried fish every day?","262","","<p>I love eating shrimps and fishes too much. I eat them fried, grilled or in oven with soup. I eat them almost daily, especially the fried fishes. The fishes are not fresh. I Buy them frozen from the supermarket. I've heard that fishes are good for heart and have many Heath benefits.</p>

<p>Is eating too much fish bad for health? </p>

<p>Thank you very much, </p>
","<p>A 2005 study, for instance, linked frequent consumption of fried fish to a 44 percent increased risk of stroke. And findings from a study in 2011 in Neurology suggested that one reason why people in the stroke belt states of the South have higher rates of stroke is that Southerners eat more fried fish than other Americans.</p>

<p>Still, this is no reason to hang up the fishing reel. After all, the latest study, which included only women, also reaffirmed that fish is good for your heart—if you broil or bake it. Those who ate five or more servings a week of baked/broiled fish over a 10-year period had a 30 percent reduced risk of heart failure, compared to women who ate less than one serving a month. Fattier fish such as salmon—which are higher in heart-healthy omega-3 fats—were most protective.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Eating fried fish on occasion is fine, especially if you serve it with a side of steamed broccoli and carrots, say, and baked, not fried, potatoes. But you’re best off choosing omega-3-rich fish, such as salmon, mackerel and sardines, and baking, poaching or broiling it. Aim for at least two servings a week of a variety of non-fried fatty fish.</p>

"How do epi-pens work? Are they specific per allergy? Epi-pen for latex allegery exist?","259","","<p>Anaphalactic-shock, from what I understand, is dangerous and terrifying. I'm grateful for whoever invented the use of epi-pens. In attempts to better understand epi-pens so that I may be prepared in case anyone experiences anaphylactic-shock around me, <strong>how do epi-pens work exactly? Where do you insert them? Are they like needles? How much do you insert? How fast does it kick-in</strong>?</p>

<p>I imagine that the epi-pens differ depending on the type of allergic reaction that is taking place. Is that correct? For instance, I know that my friend has latex allergies, <strong>is there an epi-pen specific to counteracting the cytokines that trigger the antigen for the latex?</strong> </p>
","<p><em>This is not a medical consultation or advice, only educational information. For any specific questions, talk to your doctor.</em></p>

<p>EpiPen is an injection of Epinephrine (also called Adrenaline) that is indicated for treatment of anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock), which is a clinical representation of the most severe systemic allergic reactions. Anaphylactic shock may have multiple signs and symptoms, such as: urticaria and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; hypotension; cardiac arrhythmias; unconsciousness and shock (this is an incomplete list, see picture and references for more).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQChs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQChs.jpg"" alt=""Signs and Symptoms of Anaphylaxis""></a></p>

<p>All these adverse reactions occur in the context of an IgE-mediated mechanism. IgE is a type of antibody, which is released in huge amounts in the body when a person is exposed to any type of allergen which they are sensitive to following a first exposure (of course, different people may have different allergies; some may have several, some may have none).
When IgE antibodies are released in the body, they cause multiple effects that comprise the anaphylactic shock (some were mentioned above, see references below for others).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIar8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIar8.jpg"" alt=""Anaphylactic Reaction""></a></p>

<p>Epinephrine is a natural hormone that is responsible for the activation of the <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/sympathetic_nervous_system.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sympathetic nervous system</a>. For example, it can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, it can cause dilation of the bronchi (which allows to breathe better) and other effects. For this reason, it is used as a medication for anaphylaxis, since it can reverse many of its symptoms (i.e. hypotension, bronchoconstriction etc.).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that being a natural hormone, if Epinephrine is taken orally, it is broken down in the stomach rather quickly. That is the reason it has to be given by injection.</p>

<p>I will answer some of your questions specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Epinephrine will usually begin to have an effect in a few minutes, which is important for a medication given for a life-threatening condition (anaphylaxis).</li>
<li>There are several ways to administer Epinephrine. It is agreed upon that the most beneficial method is to inject it into the thigh muscle.</li>
<li>Epipen is used to treat anaphylactic shock <strong>regardless</strong> of the allergy that caused it. No matter which allergen caused the shock, anaphylaxis is the same for all people (it is an immunologic reaction of the human body). Therefore, whether it is caused by exposure to latex, bee sting, milk etc., a person in anaphylactic shock should receive the proper dose of Epinephrine as soon as possible (there is an adult dose of 0.3 mg and a child dose of 0.15 mg).</li>
<li>For the actual method of administration (which is a very important thing to know, for everyone), you can ask a healthcare professional or watch clips on YouTube, such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YheJhyQ168Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>. (important: one of the things people overlook many times is the fact that you have to inject the medication, <strong>HOLD IT IN</strong> for 10 seconds and then pull the injector out).</li>

"How do you monitor possible Lyme disease after a treated infection?","259","","<p>A patient was diagnosed (through blood tests) with Lyme Disease after a tick bite and treated with first oral and then intravenous antibiotics, apparently successfully.  The patient saw the physician the day after the rash appeared; diagnosis took about a week.  The date of the bite was not known; the patient never saw the tick.  Treatment started with oral antibiotics but symptoms (joint pain, primarily) remained and the physician followed with a month-long course of IV antibiotics.  I do not know which specific drugs were used.  Total time from first visit to the end of the IV treatment was about five months.</p>

<p>At the time the patient was told by the physician that the blood test for Lyme looks for antibodies, which would ""always be there now"", which is why it was not possible to say with certainty that the disease had been treated.  The patient was also told that the characteristic bull's-eye rash only appears in about 25% of cases.  Years have passed since this happened.</p>

<p>If this patient were to be bitten by another tick in the future, would it be possible to make a determination of Lyme Disease?  If so, how?</p>

<p>(The patient takes appropriate precautions but knows that nothing is ever 100% effective.)</p>
","<p>Patients successfully treated for Lyme Disease do not need monitoring of any kind (there is no advantage to this.) There are no recommendations for routine antibody levels post Lyme (in fact, it is discouraged, because no one knows what the levels signify), nor yearly exams or other.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the patient (and the patient should be so instructed) to return if they are having continuing or new problems.</p>

<p>A bit of background:</p>

<p>The diagnosis and (standard) treatment of Lyme should be swift and proactive, <strong>not</strong> reliant on positive antibodies. The possibility of Lyme should be present in a physician's mind when seeing a patient with typical signs and symptoms (and should be treated <em>before</em> any confirmatory testing is completed), as well as any illness which presents a diagnostic challenge. Unfortunately <em>should</em> doesn't always translate to <em>is</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antibody test results generally are not useful for the diagnosis of early Lyme disease because only a few patients with single EM [erythema migrans] will have a positive result because the rash usually develops before antibodies are detectable. The antibody test result is often negative in the acute phase even in those with multiple EM. Even in the convalescent phase after antimicrobial treatment, antibody test results are negative in approximately half of those with single EM and a quarter of those with multiple EM. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting question on a lot of levels, some of the answers to which are still being worked out.</p>

<p>Typically when a person is first exposed to a pathogen, the early antibodies made are of the IgM class, followed temporally by IgG. IgM should not be made on re-exposure, but re-exposure should kick up the level of IgG. However, Borrelia <em>burgdorferi</em> infections are not typical.</p>

<p>In people treated early for Lyme, often IgG never develops. IgM, on the other hand, can persist for two decades or more (studies are still ongoing) as well as IgG in those who formed these antibodies. IgM, therefore, is not as predictive of initial infection as in other infections. Antibodies can't be relied upon to make a diagnosis.</p>

<p>Many patients who receive early and appropriate treatment for Lyme disease continue to live in or frequent regions where ticks are endemic, therefore repeated tick bites are quite common. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1 study of persons from New York with recently recognized Ixodes scapularis tick bites, 59 (17.6%) of 335 subjects reported new tick bites during a 6-week follow-up period...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was <em>6 weeks</em>! In one study, the reinfection (not to be confused with continuing symptoms following treatment) rate within the 5 years following initial successful treatment was ~50%. </p>

<p>Reinfection is usually accompanied by recurrence of EM and/or the fever, myalgia, and arthralgia common with initial Lyme Disease, though there is <em>some</em> (not strong) evidence that symptoms may be less severe on reinfection. So suspicion should remain high in people who live in endemic areas, of those counties near to endemic areas because of the spreading of the bacterium, time of year (most new infections occur in July, June, August and May, in descending order; there's no reason to suspect reinfection is any different), etc.</p>

<p>In the foreseealbe future, there will be tests to determine the presence of bacterial DNA in joint fluid, tissue samples and other, which will help in the diagnosis of the illness, success of treatment, and reinfection. But medicine isn't quite there yet.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this patient were to be bitten by another tick in the future, would it be possible to make a determination of Lyme Disease? If so, how?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it wouldn't be possible to test for the diagnosis. If a person in an endemic area presents with a tick bite in which the tick was starting to become engorged, a single 200mg dose of doxycycline has been shown to effectively prevent 80+% of new infections, so that's always an option (one I'm not <em>quite</em> sure of.) If the patient goes on to develop the rash or flu0like symptoms, a full course of antibiotics is then given.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There are insufficient studies about the immunology of reinfection. The diagnosis and treatment will depend on the discernment of the patient + physician. If the person is in an area with high infection rates, the index of suspicion and willingness to treat should be high. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., rash), and the possibility of exposure to infected ticks.</strong>   </li>
  <li>Current diagnostics are less than optimal for early disease because it can take weeks for a detectable immune response to be sufficiently measured. So the early stages of disease which when treatment is typically most effective unfortunately are when serum diagnostics are least effective. - <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/webinar/09242012_diagnosticswebinartranscript.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">CDC Webinar Sept 2012</a></li>

"Is Coca-Cola unhealthy?","259","","<p>I like Coca-Cola quite a lot. However I'm quite aware that it's one of the symbols of unhealthy life, along with energy drinks, burgers and playing computer games.</p>

<p>I was wondering how much is Coca-Cola actually harmful to health and <strong>how that harm works</strong>. I would also like to see other answers than those that focus only on dental health, because dental problems of coca-cola mostly also apply to oranges and apples.</p>
","<p>Coca-cola contains a lot of calories but very few nutrients, foods like that are called ""empty calories"". There is harm to the body due to regularly consuming empty calories alone. If the ratio of useful nutrients per consumed calorie goes down then that means that you would have to consume more calories to get the same amount of nutrients, which is then likely to cause weight gain. Even at the same calorie intake you may experience weight gain due to getting in less nutrients that the body needs for metabolism. The body also needs anti-oxidants to get rid of free radicals produced in metabolic processes and you'll get less of these per consumed calorie.</p>

<p>So, the best way to think about the harm is to consider that the fundamental source of the harm is not coca cola but it's due to simply being alive. A living organism is a very complex machine that needs to repair itself constantly. To do this, it needs to have a steady supply of many different raw materials. If you feed it a lot of fuel without these raw materials then simply cranking up the metabolism to match the fuel consumption to the fuel intake would do a lot of damage. What happens instead is that a fraction of the extra fuel is stored instead of burned while the metabolism is cranked up a bit. This limits the damage, the storage would allow the extra fuel to be burned safely if you would eat more vitamins and minerals later. However, if this is a chronic situation, then you'll end up burning energy in a dirtier way on the long term.</p>

<p>If instead of drinking coke you eat a large amounts of walnuts every day containing a large amounts of calories, much more than the coke you drink, then <a href=""http://nutritionfacts.org/video/testing-the-fat-burning-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">you'll hardly gain weight</a> and your <a href=""http://nutritionfacts.org/video/walnuts-and-artery-function/"" rel=""nofollow"">health will improve a lot</a>.</p>

"Alternatives to hearing aids","258","","<p>My dad has had some rather substantial hearing loss and usually uses totally-in-the-ear hearing aids. Recently, he has been dealing with a fungal ear infection in both ears and cannot use his hearing aids while treating the ear infections. However, he still does need to hear and do stuff. Are there any devices similar to hearing aids that can temporarily improve hearing, but which do not need to go into the ear? I have been looking at personal hearing amplifiers and personal FM microphones, etc., but I was not sure which of these are the best temporary hearing aid substitute.</p>
","<p>This is a very pragmatic question and I would like give you an explicit answer. Unfortunately I think that there is only so little objective information which hearing aid is the best.</p>

<p>As said when the best aid is considered it is a very subjective matter. There is no clear comparative studies about different hearing aids, especially if those without ear canal implant are used. If your father suffers from fungal infection is is natural that aids figured below are not pleasant due to ear canal irritation:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckQBB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckQBB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many choices of hearing aid styles are available, including the following: completely in the canal (A), in the canal (B), in the ear (C), behind the ear (D), receiver in canal or receiver in the ear (E), and open fit (F).</p>

<p>As so, <strong>Personal Sound Amplification Products</strong> (PSAP) may seem appropriate as a temporary aid <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/HearingAids/ucm181482.htm#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(FDA)</a>. It is however, important to notice that these aids are not as powerful as actual hearing aids.</p>

<p><em>I would recommend to consult an audiologist to get some insight to PSAPs. Also I would seek a brick-and-mortar shop which sells these aids, since most likely the sellers have valuable consumer info on these aids and can help deciding the right aid.</em></p>

<p>I would like to also remind that it is <strong>extremely important</strong> to get the fungal infection treated and return to use the ordinary aid, since <strong>hearing loss can severely reduce the quality of life</strong>.</p>

"What are too high and too low levels of blood pressure?","251","","<p>At what blood pressure levels (either too high or too low) should I be alarmed and seek a doctor's advice?</p>
","<p>You should consult a physician for treatment of hypertension if you fit into the categories below. </p>

<p>When should you be alarmed? That's subjective. Physicians are alarmed when they see systolic blood pressure (SBP) is equal to or greater than 180 mm Hg, or where diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is equal to or greater than 120 mm Hg; HBP with any signs or symptoms (especially stroke symptoms, confusion, hallucinations, etc.) is an emergency. Patients should be alarmed long  before physicians are - in other words, get treated before it becomes dangerous! </p>

<p>The Eighth Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC 8) analyzed large studies of hypertension from 1966 through 2009 - with some consideration of studies up to 2013 - and made recommendations for adults age 18 and older with hypertension. The outcomes considered in making these recommendations, i.e. what will happen if one fails to lower blood pressure (BP) were, among others:</p>

<ul>
<li>overall mortality</li>
<li>cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality</li>
<li>chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related mortality</li>
<li>myocardial infarction, heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke</li>
<li>need for coronary, carotid, renal, and lower extremity revascularization (bypass, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>They rated their recommendations on strength of evidence. Grades were assigned.  </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Strong - based on substantial (good) evidence (strongly recommended)<br>
<strong>B</strong>: Moderate - the net benefit is moderate to substantial<br>
<strong>C</strong>: Weak - moderate certainty that there is a small net benefit<br>
<strong>D</strong>: Against -no net benefit or that risks/harms outweigh benefits.<br>
<strong>E</strong>: Expert Opinion  - <em>insufficient</em> evidence but the committee recommends (no great studies available) - further research recommended<br>
<strong>N</strong>: No Recommendation for or against - insufficient/unclear/conflicting evidence; further research is recommended in this area.</p>

<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: aged 60 years or older, treat to lower BP if systolic blood pressure (SBP) is equal to or greater than 150 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is equal to or greater than 90 mm Hg. Goal: SBP &lt; 150 mm Hg; DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg. (<strong>controversial</strong> for individuals 60 years or older who do not have diabetes or chronic kidney disease)</p>

<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: ages 30 through 59 years, treat DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher; goal DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg. </p>

<p><strong>Grade B</strong>: patients &lt; 60 years with hypertension (HTN): treat; goal: BP &lt; 140/90 mm Hg. </p>

<p><strong>Grade E</strong>: ages 18 through 29 years, treat DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher; goal DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg.</p>

<p>In patients with SBP between 130-150 mm Hg, there was no increase in risk in adverse effects.</p>

<p>LOW BP: There are no JNC8 recommendations; the decision to treat is based on expert opinion only. Goal: decrease <em>symptoms</em>; treat underlying cause (if any) (I.e.: if you're active, have no problems, but your BP is 80/60 - well... that's great! No adverse outcome is known.</p>

"What effect does long-term caffeine use have on memory?","251","","<p>I've seen plenty of references to the same study of how caffeine benefits memory after one day of use <a href=""http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/01/12/caffeine-enhances-memory"">(1)</a> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182035"">(2)</a> <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/caffeine-healthy-diet-may-boost-memory-thinking-skills-alcohols-effect-uncertain-201406187219"">(3)</a>, but what about long-term use?</p>

<p>There are all sort of factors to long-term use such as sleep and adapting to dosage, and I'm extremely surprised that I haven't found any such study given the wide pervasiveness of caffeine in the modern world.</p>
","<p>There are actually quite a lot of studies pointing in all directions when it comes to memory and caffeine use. I wouldn't call it a closed case by any standard, although many sites hawk caffeine as a great improver of memory, especially long-term memory.</p>

<p><strong>Some studies showing no effects of long-term caffeine use on memory:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12404609"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hameleers et al. (2000)</a>: A large number of adults (1875) ranging in age from 21 to 84 were studied while consuming caffeine over long periods of time. Even after compensation for various medical and sociological factors, no effects on short-term memory were observed. The sheer amount of data gathered is one thing in favor of this study, as outliers would not have influenced the result.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10458050"" rel=""noreferrer"">Herz (1999)</a>: A large number of subjects were studied while undergoing certain sessions containing cognitive tasks. No effects on memory were observed from caffeine usage.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7675951"" rel=""noreferrer"">Warburton (1995)</a>: Low doses of caffeine were used on subjects over an extended period of time. There were non-negligible mood changes, but no effects on working memory. Note that this study focused in part on caffeine deprivation, rather than giving subjects additional caffeine.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some studies showing positive effects of long-term caffeine use on memory:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12424493"" rel=""noreferrer"">Angelucci et al. (2002)</a>: A group of rats (not humans!) was studied, given caffeine injections at various points during training. They were then given the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_water_navigation_task"" rel=""noreferrer"">Morris water maze test</a>. Some of the rats were able to better remember pervious sessions - as the authors put it,

<blockquote>
  <p>These data provide evidence that caffeine improves memory retention but not memory acquisition, explaining some discrepancies among reports in the literature.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><a href=""http://jn.nutrition.org/content/144/6/890.abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">Beydoun et al. (2014)</a>: Caffeine and alcohol use and diet were studied simultaneously in a large group of subjects. The findings were mixed, although some evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that caffeine use can increase overall cognitive function in older adults.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some studies showing negative effects of long-term caffeine use on memory:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400186"" rel=""noreferrer"">Han et al. (2007)</a>: Subjects were studied over four weeks while using low doses of caffeine. A slight decrease in memory function was observed, caused in part by inhibition of part of the hippocampus.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't shown the same amount of studies in all three categories - neutral, positive, and negative - and that's by design. There is a substantial amount of studies that found no significant effects, and that much more research would be needed to give strong evidence for long-term benefits. There is a decent amount of studies showing some positive long-term benefits, and almost none showing negative long-term benefits.</p>

<p>Therefore, I don't think it's safe to go in any of the three directions. However, it does seem like the effects of long-term caffeine use may be negligible.</p>

<p>Also, be careful to differentiate between long-term effects of caffeine on memory and the effects of caffeine on long-term memory! Studies often cover both, because studying subjects over only a few days won't tell you much about long-term memory (certainly not about acquisition, at least). However, they aren't the same thing.</p>

"How is pain measured?","248","","<p>Patients are often asked to rate their level of pain. Usually, I have found that these questions come without instructions as to what constitutes the maximum on this scale (maximum pain you can imagine? maximum pain you ever felt?). </p>

<p>What are ways pain can be quantified in these situations? Are there any ""objective"" (as objective as this can be) measures to help patients with this? </p>
","<p>Please note that the pain scale is usually used to evaluate the <em>efficacy of treatment</em>. As long as the pain is responding to treatment, there need not be objectivity <em>per se</em>. </p>

<p>Was it a '7' on arrival? is it a '2' after a couple of doses of an analgesic? (if so, Great! Can we safely get it to a '1' or '0'? Did it spike to a '5' today? Why might that be? Is there something the team is missing that is causing the pain to be poorly controlled?) </p>

<p>This is the goal of the pain scale. For this reason, there is no <em>need</em> for  objectivity.</p>

<p><strong>Can pain be objectively measured, therefore reported?</strong></p>

<p>The intensity of pain (as you have mentioned) is often left to the patient to describe on a scale of 1-10, or a visual analogue of faces. There is nothing objective about these methods, nor can there be, because pain is not objective; it is subjective.</p>

<p><strong>Pain is subjective</strong></p>

<p><em>Pain</em> is a subjective experience; you cannot tell with certainty how much pain your fellow human is experiencing, which is why we <em>ask</em> people; they then can tell us. Pain relief (both physical and emotional) is a significant part of medicine, yet we still have ""pain scales"" for self-reported pain, one of the more common ones being the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UEnH8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To try to accurately assess pain (which is still <em>subjective</em>), a patient's scale should be interpreted by a caregiver using examples <em>appropriate to that patient</em> (If the person has had severe kidney stones, for example, the examiner can use that as a ""10"".) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the worst pain I ever had was a kidney infection where I eventually passed out. If I take that as a 10, very few things even get to a 7 ;-) which is why I am asking. So you're basically saying physicians expect a high number much earlier than that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we don't expect a lot of 8/9/10s on the scale. We hope it will be used exactly as you have described: in many cases, 10 is described by a caregiver as ""the worst pain you ever had."" If the patient has never had severe pain before (kidney stones, childbirth [for most], etc.) the pain has to be imagined.</p>

<p>Left to their own devices, a patient might look like a 6, but be reporting a 10. In this case, a nurse must try to ascertain their actual level of their pain. But still, it is their pain, and how it is felt differs from person to person, which is why no objective criteria can be assigned the pain scale.</p>

Does current evidence suggest that the benefits of alcohol outweigh the risks in terms of mortality, and what is the optimal level of alcohol consumption for maximizing life expectancy?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/592/165"">Another answer</a> did a great job laying out some of the difficulties plaguing research on this topic.

I would like to point out two alternative lines of research that may leave the reader with some hope that we’ll eventually have a good answer to this question.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Surrogate markers</strong>: A major difficulty with research in this area is that it’s not practical to randomize an adequate number of people to alcohol vs no alcohol<sup>1</sup> for a long enough period of time to see statistically significant differences in outcomes like heart attacks, strokes, and death. However, in many areas &mdash; most prominently cardiovascular disease &mdash; researchers have used <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/25_suppl_1/IV-20.long"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">surrogate markers</a> that tend to evolve more quickly and have been shown to correlate with the <em>real</em> endpoint that we are interested in. This approach allows us to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acquire <strong>randomized</strong> data due to the shorter duration of study required, avoiding all of the mess of observational confounds or; </li>
<li>(Less optimal but still something): use observational methods but analyze endpoints that are less likely to be confounded. </li>
</ul>

<p>I include two papers that review interventional data suggesting a benefit of alcohol on surrogate endpoints: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d636"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Effect of alcohol consumption on biological markers associated with risk of coronary heart disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies.</a><sup>2</sup></p>

<li><p><strong>Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials</strong> (with real endpoints) <strong>in the making</strong>: 
This is what we want. There is an <a href=""http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/ac_search_results.htm?text_curr=U34&amp;Search_Type=Activity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIH U34</a> active for planning a multi-center <a href=""https://www.collectiveip.com/grants/NIH:8757476"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">long-term randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of alcohol on the development of chronic diseases.</a> You may be wondering how you randomize and blind people to alcohol consumption.

"What are the consequences of chronic sleep deprivation for mental function?","248","","<p>Some people don't sleep enough due to work, school, or personal issues. Regardless of the cause, what are the long-term impacts of losing sleep when describing mental performance in particular? I am interested in memory and measures of cognition, not psychological health.</p>
","<p>Most of the time it is critically important to realize that sleep deprivation is very often due to unrecognized sleep disorders. After a typical night's sleep, you may not feel restored and refreshed and be sleepy during the day, but be totally unaware that you are sleep-deprived or have a sleep disorder. You might tend to think, ""It's just the stress of work or the kids,"" or you might have ""always felt this way"" and had no idea that you should feel differently. This lack of awareness compounds the consequences, because so many people remain undiagnosed for years.<br> <br> Now speaking about the disorders or consequences that the sleep deprivation can cause are. <br></p>

<ul>
<li><h1>Decreased Performance and Alertness:</h1> Sleep deprivation induces significant reductions in performance and alertness. Reducing your nighttime sleep by as little as one and a half hours for just one night could result in a reduction of daytime alertness by as much as 32%.<br><br>
</li>
<li><h1>Memory and Cognitive Impairment:</h1> Decreased alertness and excessive daytime sleepiness impair your memory and your cognitive ability -- your ability to think and process information.<br><br>

</li>
<li><h1>Automobile Injury:</h1> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates conservatively that each year drowsy driving is responsible for at least 100,000 automobile crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities.<br><br>
<li><h1>Increase Stroke risk:</h1>Even without the typical risk factors, like being overweight or having a family history, short sleep can up your risk for stroke, according to 2012 research. Adults who regularly slept fewer than six hours a night had four times the risk of stroke symptoms,<br><br>
</li>
<li><h1>Fuel Memory Loss:</h1>You probably know that on the days when you are most tired, you're forgetful and unfocused -- but sleep deprivation can lead to permanent cognitive issues. The less we sleep, the less we benefit from the memory-storing properties of sleep. But additionally, a lack of sleep can cause ""brain deterioration,"" according to a 2013 study, which may at least in part explain memory loss in seniors.<br><br>

"Why is it so much harder to swallow pills than it is to swallow food?","248","","<p>I don't have any real trouble swallowing pills, and I do it several times a day.  But when I try to swallow a pill without food or water in my mouth, it is a bit tricky.  We're not talking about huge horse pills either, just regular, relatively small pills.  I can swallow a whole raw oyster, which is the size of hundreds of pills combined, but a single little capsule or tablet is too much for me to consume without food or water?  </p>

<p>It feels like I am struggling to convince my tongue and throat to cooperate with me, and they don't trust my judgment in choosing what I should and shouldn't swallow.</p>

<p>What is going on here?  Is there some sort of physiological explanation for this?</p>

<p><em>Note:  I am fully aware that my tongue and throat don't have minds of their own, and are incapable of trusting or mistrusting me.  I am merely trying to explain what it feels like.</em></p>
","<p>The human (and other animals) upper digestive tract is 'designed' to ingest relatively large (compared to most pills), soft, moist boluses.  The muscles of the tongue and pharynx can propel these kinds of objects (including liquid) into the esophagus with ease, unless there is some specific pathology at work.  Chewing also tends to naturally push food toward the swallowing position.</p>

<p>The tablets and capsules you asked about, on the other hand, tend to be dry and hard and are not chewed.  There is little for the tongue and throat muscles to 'grab' as they try to push the object back to where it can actually enter the esophagus.  They also tend to get stuck because of their dryness.</p>

<p>Once you have actually swallowed a pill without water or food to help it along, the difficulty for the ingestion process does not end.  The esophagus also has difficulty pushing them down to the stomach, though gravity helps.  Sometimes they do end up lodged in the esophagus where they ultimately dissolve and pass on down, but not before they may have caused damage to the lining of the esophagus from their caustic properties or just from the pressure of it's presence.</p>

"Increase immunity to common cold and cough","247","","<p>What are some home remedies (preventive) that I can try on a regular basis to increase my immunity to common cold?
I get it way too often...almost once every couple of months.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is viral and goes away (although the cough lingers), other times , it turns into a chest-lung infection with a cough that wakes up the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I don't smoke. I dont mind a bit of cold and runny nose, but the cough is really bothersome.</p>
","<p>The ""common cold"" is a syndrome that is characterized by signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infection: sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, rhinorrhea, cough, and sinus congestion.  Malaise (the feeling of ""feeling sick"") is reported, but is generally more mild than with the flu.  Fever is uncommon with colds.  Myalgias and arthralgias (muscle and joint aches) are also reported but are typically more mild than with flu).</p>

<p>The common cold is invariably caused by viruses and more than one family of viruses is capable of producing this syndrome with varying degrees of severity and duration depending on the virus.  The best known virus family is the <em>rhinoviridae</em>.</p>

<p>Rhinovirus has at least 99 serotypes.  This presents a challenge to the body's immune system as an immune response to one serotype may not provide any protection against other serotypes.  It is possible for a person to be consecutively infected with rhinoviridae of different serotypes.  The durability of immunity to a rhinovirus strain, once established, is not known.  It remains possible that over time, a person can become susceptible to reinfection.</p>

<p>Because human adaptive immunity requires antigen exposure, there is little that someone can do on their own to ""boost"" their specific immunity against cold viruses.  There is no vaccine (so many viruses and serotypes to consider). Boosting non-specific immunity (the acute inflammatory mechanisms) is a strategy that has not been well explored, but this approach is hard to recommend.  Non-specific immunity is a two-edged sword with the potential to damage the host's own body in addition to its role as the ""first responders"" to a pathogen.</p>

<p><strong>Airborne like products.</strong> Over the counter products that purport to ""boost immunity to colds"" are largely clinically untested.  Vitamin C has been examined.  In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shorted cold duration.</p>

<p>Most over the counter immune boosters for colds are vitamin B and C based, which makes them safe and reasonably non-toxic so their use can't be discouraged.  Therapeutic doses of water-soluble vitamins usually result in very expensive urine.</p>

<p><strong>Zinc.</strong> Recently an analysis of several studies showed that zinc lozenges or syrup reduced the length of a cold by one day, especially when taken within 24 hours of the first signs and symptoms of a cold.  Studies also showed that taking zinc regularly might reduce the number of colds each year, the number of missed school days, and the amount of antibiotics required in otherwise healthy children.  Zinc can potentially have some side-effects, so you should talk to your doctor before beginning zinc supplementation.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Rhinoviridae is very infectious, lives outside the body for hours to days, and is readily transmitted by auto-inoculation from encounters with contaminated surfaces.  The best ""immune booster"" for colds really, truly is frequent hand-washing.</p>

"Does blindness stop the production of melatonin?","243","","<p>Melatonin is the hormone that gives the ""expectation"" of darkness. It has no use in blind people, so do they slowly stop (or immediately) secreting it? I heard it is given artificially to help with circadian patterns.</p>
","<p><em>Before answering your question, let’s first go through some essential concepts:</em></p>

<p><strong>What are the structures involved in the circadian system?</strong>
The organ that controls the 24-hour rhythm responsible for sleep-wake cycles, alertness and performance patterns, fluctuation in body temperature and production of hormones (e.g melatonin and cortisol) is the <strong>suprachiasmatic nuclei (SNC)</strong> of the anterior hypothalamus. The major environmental factor that resets our internal clock to 24 hours is the light and dark cycle generated by the earth’s axial rotation.</p>

<p><strong>The neuroanatomy of the circadian system is following</strong>: light information is transduced from specialised <strong>retinal photoreceptors to the SCN by the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT)</strong>. SNC projects to the <strong>pineal gland</strong> via the <strong>paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG)</strong>. Under normal light-dark conditions, the <strong>pineal melatonin</strong> rhythm peaks at night during the dark phase. However, light exposure during the night inhibits melatonin production.</p>

<p>Your question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Melatonin] has no use in blind people, so do they slowly stop secreting it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, several studies have tried to monitor the level of cortisol and melatonin in blind people and the results were very different. Overall, there is a <strong>heterogeneous distribution of melatonin rhythm types</strong>. According to one of the longitudinal study conducted among 20 blind subjects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three subjects had normally phased melatonin rhythms, three were
  abnormally entrained, and 11 had free-running melatonin rhythms with
  periods ranging from 23.86 to 25.08 h. The remaining three subjects
  appeared to be arrhythmic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Why is the case?</em> Probably because not all disorders of the visual system cause a disruption of the circadian effects of light. Several studies have shown that the majority of legally blind individuals retain some degree of light perception even with very little usable vision.</p>

<p><em>Why do individuals with absent or attenuated rod and cone function still retain circadian responses to light (20% of the nonperception of light patients according to some studies)?</em> Some recent advances have identified a new non-cone photoreceptor system (based on a novel molecule called melanopsin) that is involved in circadian rhythm regulation.</p>

"Causes of polypoid foveolar hyperplasia","242","","<p>Six years ago during an endoscopy, the gastroenterologist noted that he had seen a small nodule forming in my stomach.</p>

<p>A recent endoscopy revealed <em>3 nodules</em>. The biopsies showed that they were benign, but I'm curious as to why I now have 3 of them.</p>

<p>I asked the new gastroenterologist, who spoke very broken English, so it was difficult to understand her. She seemed to be saying that they just ""decided"" to start aggregating for no known reason. </p>

"Dietary Factors for Calcium Oxalate Kidney Stones","234","","<p>Is there any evidence that diet factors play a big role in the creation of calcium oxalate kidney stones? Some doctors and other sources recommend cutting out coffee, tea, soft drinks, and dietary calcium to reduce the risk of stones. Other sources seem to recommend cutting out dietary items that increase oxalate levels.</p>

<p>It seems that scientists have a good understanding of how kidneys function, yet there doesn't seem to be a consensus for dietary recommendations for these types of stones.</p>

<p>The most obvious answer would seem to be water consumption. The less water one consumes, the less dilute the urine in the kidney becomes.</p>
","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Most kidney stones (~80%) are calcium stones, and the majority of those are primarily composed of calcium oxalate. Oxalate (C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) is a dianion that combines with divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium. The magnesium salt is much more soluble than the calcium salt. Because these cations compete for binding to oxalate, both lower magnesium levels and higher calcium levels will tend to cause precipitation (movement out of solution into crystalline form) of calcium oxalate. When this happens in the urine in large enough quantities, it can form “stones.”</p>

<h2>Does diet matter?</h2>

<p>As introduced by the OP, doctors have historically advised patients who have demonstrated a propensity toward calcium oxalate stone formation (or, more generically: kidney stones) to decrease dietary intake of calcium and oxalate.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary calcium</strong>  </p>

<p>In 1993, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8441427"">a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> dispelled the notion that a low calcium diet should be advised for these patients. They found the opposite association: higher calcium intake correlates with <em>reduced</em> stone formation (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.43 - 0.73). This somewhat counter-intuitive effect may be explained by the binding of calcium with oxalate in the gut, which tends to decrease oxalate absorption. The recommendation to decrease calcium intake, then, appears not to be valid. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11784873"">Further studies</a> have refined this recommendation, and it is now generally said that a <strong>normal</strong> calcium intake is probably best.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary oxalate</strong>  </p>

<p>Oxalate is found in <a href=""http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/urology-kidney/treatments-procedures/kidney-stones-oxalate-controlled-diet"">an odd assortment of foods</a>: beets, spinach, rhubarb, strawberries, nuts, chocolate, tea, wheat bran, and all dry beans (fresh, canned, or cooked), excluding lima and green beans. This has largely been a “seems like it should work” approach rather than data-driven. In fact, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17538185"">large epidemiological studies</a> have not shown an association between oxalate intake and stone formation.</p>

<p><strong>Other dietary associations</strong>  </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8441427"">NEJM study mentioned above</a> also looked at other correlations between stone formation and dietary components. Animal protein was directly correlated with increased risk of stones, whereas potassium and fluid intake were correlated with decreased risk.</p>

<p><strong>A different approach</strong>  </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24560157"">most recent interesting development</a> in this area that I’m aware of was published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease in 2014 and compared the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)-style diet with a low-oxalate diet for prevention of stones. Their reasoning is nicely summarized in the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[M]ost people do not eat isolated nutrients, but meals consisting of a variety of foods with complex combinations of nutrients. A more rational approach to nephrolithiasis prevention would be to base dietary advice on the cumulative effects of foods and different dietary patterns rather than single nutrients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DASH diet was, as its name suggests, developed as a tool to mitigate hypertension, but it has been used as a sort of paradigm “healthy diet” in trials of a variety of interventions. It is, as described in the paper above, high in fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein. The high fruit and nut content may be expected to increase urinary oxalate, but these foods also tend to be high in magnesium and citrate, both of which are inhibitors of calcium stone formation.</p>

<p>The authors collected 24-hour urine samples in participants with a known history of stones and randomized them to a DASH diet vs a low-oxalate diet. They found that urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate (a measure of tendency to form calcium oxalate stones) was decreased in the DASH group compared to the low-oxalate group. This occurred despite a trend toward <em>increased</em> oxalate excretion in that group. The authors posit that this may have been due to the increased urinary pH and concentrations of citrate, magnesium, and potassium, all of which tend to decrease stone formation.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are not solid data supporting a low oxalate diet for stone prevention. Other dietary factors that are probably helpful include: normal calcium intake; high intake of fluid, magnesium, and potassium; low animal protein.</p>

"Can people who are epileptic be more sensitive to heat exhaustion/heat stroke?","233","","<p><a href=""https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/epilepsy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Epilepsy</a> is a condition that seems to encompass many possible things: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've read that people with photosensitive epilepsy can react badly with exposure to flashing light, or irregular light patterns (such as sunlight peeking through trees in a forest).</p>

<p>Is it also true that tiredness can trigger seizures/passing out (for people with epilepsy), or, in particular, exposure to too much heat? Some people have told me this, but none of them are medical professionals and I'm not either. <a href=""http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/conditions/brain-and-nervous-system/a336/epilepsy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This website</a> gives examples such as lack of oxygen/infections/stroke, but it's not clear from anywhere I've looked if epileptic attacks could ever be caused by excessive exposure to heat.</p>
","<p>Something that is worth mentioning right out of the gate is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_seizure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">febrile seizure</a> (see also <a href=""http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/febrile-seizures"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Epilepsy Foundation</a>). These are sudden seizures, generally experienced by young children, resulting from an especially high fever. The generally accepted (although not fully confirmed) mechanism is via something called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_alkalosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>respiratory alkalosis</em></a> (see e.g. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797883/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mazarati (2007)</a>). Hyperthermia, among other processes<sup>1</sup>, triggers an imbalance in blood pH and pCO<sub>2</sub>, which in turn can increase brain activity, leading to a seizure. Children (generally below the age of six) are especially vulnerable.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it would make sense that heat could be a possible seizure trigger. That said, there are some things to bear in mind. First, children who experience a febrile seizure are likely to never have a seizure again; these seizures are generally not linked to epilepsy, although a family history of seizures may contribute to this. Therefore, there are two questions to ask: Can heat stroke cause seizures, and is this more prevalent for people with epilepsy?</p>

<p>We also need to consider that instances of heat stroke can be quite different. Often, it is convenient to divide cases into two categories: Exertional heat stroke (EHS), and non-exertional/classical heat stroke (NEHS/CHS). <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017</em></a> gives a rather nice comparison on page 551. There are a few differences that pertain to our case, some of which I've copied here:</p>

<pre><code>Patient Characteristics |     Classic     | Exertional 
--------------------------------------------------------
Age                     | Young children/ |  15-55 yr
                        |   the elderly   |
--------------------------------------------------------
Fever                   |     Unusual     |   Common
--------------------------------------------------------
Activity                |    Sedentary    |  Strenuous
                        |                 |   exercise
--------------------------------------------------------
Acid-base disturbances  |   Respiratory   |   Lactic
                        |    alkalosis    |  acidosis
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that respiratory alkalosis is described as more common classic heat stroke, which afflicts children, whereas <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lactic acidosis</a> is more prevalent in exertional heat stroke. Interestingly enough, I haven't been able to find any information on the latter <em>causing</em> seizures, although I have seen references indicating it can arise as a byproduct of seizures, especially tonic-clonic (""grand mal"") seizures.</p>

<p>It is, of course, well-known that heat stroke can trigger once-off seizures in people, often including small children (which should be apparent from some of the above). This has been well-studied in, of all creatures, dogs, which have unfortunately high mortality relates, often from being left trapped in a car or other area which rapidly becomes very hot. <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=zeEqDQAAQBAJ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One book</a> states that an astonishing <em>35%</em> of dogs who suffer from heat stroke experience seizures in the process; <a href=""http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3074&amp;context=iowastate_veterinarian"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this may arise from cerebral edema</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>) or something else. I don't have comparable statistics for humans (I assume the mortality rates are better than the 50%+ I've seen quote for dogs), but it's clear that heat stroke can, and often will, cause seizures.</p>

<p>Again, though, these seizures - like febrile seizures - generally do not recur. They are distinct and separate from epileptic seizures. Therefore, our second question is still unanswered.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.epilepsy.com/connect/forums/living-epilepsy-adults/overheating-seizure-trigger"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Countless</a> <a href=""http://www.coping-with-epilepsy.com/forums/f23/heat-sensitivity-3790/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">forums</a> (why people use all caps is beyond me) are full of stories of people with epilepsy suffering seizures purportedly due to heat stroke, heat exhaustion, or something similar. I'm assuming these are cases of exertional heat stroke. However, <em>these seizures are not necessarily caused by epilepsy</em>. They may be entirely coincidental. A person with epilepsy may have a seizure brought on by something unrelated to the primary cause of their epilepsy.</p>

<p>There are some exceptions - but they occur predominantly in children. I stated before that children who experience a febrile seizure are likely to never have another. This is true, but there are underlying conditions which may produce febrile seizures repeatedly, or, rather, make it more likely for heat-related seizures to occur. Two important ones are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy_with_febrile_seizures_plus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+)</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravet_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dravet syndrome</a>, also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI). The latter may be regarded as a special case of the former. Both are genetic, caused by mutations in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nav1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SCN1A gene</a>; they may or may not be inheritable.</p>

<p>Essentially, mutations in SCN1A (or perhaps another gene) occasionally inhibits <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sodium channels</a> from working properly, which in term can lead to a seizure. The links between high temperatures and the channels are more tenuous, though <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun et al. (2012)</a> have suggested that in cases of GEFS+, heat may impact the voltage across the channels, further impacting their ability to properly function (see also <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/10/3994.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oakley et al. (2008)</a>, studying mice with Dravet Syndrome).</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, it appears that</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat stroke can indeed cause seizures, especially in children and small animals. Fevers can have the same effects, and may be more severe. However, all of these seizures are normally one-time events.</li>
<li>There <em>are</em> underlying diseases which result in epilepsy with heat sensitivity. Repeated febrile seizures may arise as a result. However, these are usually - though not always - limited to young children. Most people with epilepsy likely do not have to worry about being ""triggered"" by heat much more than most people do.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do think that an appropriate analogy to draw here is with photosensitive epilepsy, as you did. While rapidly flashing lights <em>can</em> lead to a seizure, this is generally limited to a subset of those with epilepsy.</p>

<p><sup>1 Hyperventilation is another possible seizure trigger, acting via a similar mechanism. I'm guessing you're more familiar with it.</sup></p>

"Is it possible for the lungs and heart to work independently of one another?","232","","<p>I understand that the lungs take in oxygen, pass it to the heart to send throughout the body, and receive CO2 from cellular respiration that the lungs then breathe out. (Oversimplified, I know, but let's run with it for a minute, if we can.)</p>

<p>Is it possible for the lungs to function without the heart functioning? That is, can the lungs take in oxygen, and, not having anywhere to put it, breathe it back out? Of course, breathing out wouldn't contain any excess CO2 because the heart doesn't collect it from the body. </p>

<p>In the event that the answer is yes, would CPR be performed differently, i.e. without the breaths between the 30 pushes?</p>

<p>What about the converse case: can the heart function without the lungs functioning? I suppose anaerobic respiration is one form of this, but can that be sustained long-term? Once again, if the answer is yes, would CPR be performed differently?</p>
","<p>You're overlooking one important point: Both the heart and lungs are living tissue too, and without both circulating blood and oxygen they will die just like all the other tissues in the body. So no, neither one can continue to function without the other.</p>

<p>As for CPR, I don't see how anything would change. Without circulating blood in the lungs, no gas exchange can occur, and that's the one thing lungs do. As for the the heart, without oxygen being delivered by the lungs the heart would stop quickly. (But that's okay because the brain would already be dead at that point.)</p>

<p>So no, the two are completely inter-dependent and cannot function independently. </p>

<p>Since prolonged fasting (traditional, no food fasting) is hard for people to stick to, they came up with a reduced diet, with specific ratios of carbohydrates, proteins, fats and other nutrients.</p>

<p>However, they did stress that it is not something that should just be done without intervention, and also that if you are at or below a normal body weight, it probably shouldn't be done.</p>

"What are the symptoms of Migraine and how to categorise into severe or mild etc","224","","<p>How to identify if someone suffers from migraine? and how is the migraine categorised ie whether it is severe, mild etc?</p>
","<h2>How to identify migraine</h2>

<p>Traditionally, if you had headaches you would discuss your symptoms with a doctor who would then classify the type of headache you had based on what you reported. If you didn't think of something to report, or didn't think (for example) that your nausea was related to your headaches (and so didn't report it), then your headache type may be misdiagnosed. Personally, I received several different ""headache diagnoses"" over the years, depending on how I reported my symptoms and the doctor I was seeing at the time.</p>

<p>In 2003, a group of researchers published a study (Lipton) where they determined the ID Migraine test was a reliable screening test for determining whether a patient had migraine. This test was further validated by additional studies in 2011 (Cousins), and has since been translated into additional languages and studied further (Karli). </p>

<p><strong>ID Migraine Test</strong></p>

<p>The ID Migraine test is considered positive for migraine if the patient answers yes to 2 or more of the following 3 questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has a headache limited your activities for a day or more in the last three months?</li>
<li>Are you nauseated or sick to your stomach when you have a headache?</li>
<li>Does light bother you when you have a headache?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Migraine Symptoms</strong> </p>

<p>More generally, the <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/basics/symptoms/con-20026358"" rel=""nofollow"">symptoms of migraine</a> may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pain on one side or both sides of your head</li>
<li>Pain that has a pulsating, throbbing quality</li>
<li>Sensitivity to light, sounds and sometimes smells</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting</li>
<li>Aura 
<ul>
<li>Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light</li>
<li>Vision loss</li>
<li>Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg</li>
<li>Speech or language problems (aphasia)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to classify severity of migraine</h2>

<p>Severity of migraine is usually judged based on how the symptoms affect the patient's ability to conduct daily activities. There are several scales available to test this, but the two most popular seem to be the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT).</p>

<p><strong>MIDAS</strong></p>

<p>MIDAS was developed in 2001 (Steward) and is based on asking the patient to count the number of days they have been impacted by their headaches (specifically addressing work, household, and social activities). The more days a person is impacted, the more severe their migraine is considered.  MIDAS can be <a href=""http://www.achenet.org/midas/"" rel=""nofollow"">found online</a> at the American Headache Society.</p>

<p><strong>HIT</strong></p>

<p>HIT is a newer test, developed in 2011 (Yang). It asks the patient to consider the impact of migraine on their activities in the past 4 weeks, on a five point scale that progresses from ""Never"" to ""Always"". Having more responses on the positive end of the scale (Sometimes/Very Often/Always) will indicate that a person is more severely affected by migraine. The HIT can be <a href=""http://www.headaches.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/pdf/HIT-6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">found online</a> on the National Headaches Foundation.</p>

<p>What you call a ""regular"" ultrasound is known in medical practice as an transabdominal ultrasound. It is a very common procedure, which, depending on the countries, may be done by physicians, nurses or radiology assistants. A transvaginal ultrasound consists of an ultrasound probe inserted (after ultrasound gel is applied on it) into the vaginal cavity. Patients undergoing this procedure describe it as non painful. It is the same sensation as when a speculum is inserted in the vagina to do a pap smear.</p>

<p><strong>Adnexal masses can be classified as:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Benign ovarian</strong> (polycystic ovaries, teratomas, functional cysts,...)</li>
<li><strong>Benign non-ovarian</strong> (paratubal cyst, hydrosalpinges,...)</li>
<li><strong>Primary malignant ovarian</strong> (carcinoma,...)</li>
<li><strong>Secondary malignant ovarian</strong> (ie metastasis)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group has described 6 essential patterns which help differentiating benign masses (ie for example ovarian cysts in PCOS) or malignant masses using an ultrasound:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is the cyst unilocular, multilocular, unilocular solid,...?</li>
<li>How is the cystic content? Is it anechoic, haemorrhagic, mixed,...?</li>
<li>Any wall irregularities?</li>
<li>How is the vascularisation?</li>
<li>Are there any shadows behind the lesions?</li>
<li>Is there liquid in the peritoneal cavity (=ascites)?</li>
</ol>

<p>Using these criteria might help differentiating benign masses with malignant masses. Here some examples:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nOCIf.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nOCIf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If doubt persist, some indications in the personal history or other clinical examination (+/- biomarkers) might help providing additional evidence in favor of a benign or malignant cause. Finally, confirmation can only be done through histology.</p>

"Health consequences of higher melanin production","220","","<p>When I was on vacation down south last time, I wondered about the phenomenon of tanning.</p>

<p>I am a medical layman. But as far as I  understand, in case of a higher UV radiation, our body produces more melanin. So, our skin gets darker.</p>

<p>But why does our body not keep this higher melanin level?
Is there any advantage of the skin getting brighter again?</p>

<p>A higher melanin level provides the advantage of less sunburn, etc., so I would have assumed that a high melanin level would be maintained consistently rather than being regulated by sun exposure.  Is there is any medical disadvantage of a high melanin level during periods of reduced sun exposure.</p>
","<p>The easy answer is that skin turns over, and rather quickly at that. Specialized skin cells called melanocytes impart more or less melanin (through granules called melanosomes) to keratinocytes; these cells then are what give you a tan. The keratinocytes undergo constant turnover, so are eventually shed, and in the absence of continued exposure to UV radiation, there is no need to keep producing melanin-heavy keratinocytes. (It's a bit more complicated, but that's the basic idea.) </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H6jJW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H6jJW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The keratins and proteins within the stratum corneum act mainly by scattering and absorbing the UV. UV-R sets in action an integrated mechanism for the formation and delivery of melanin within melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes. This mechanism is probably triggered by keratinocytes, which respond to UV-R with bursts of mitoses and with increased production of ET-1 and POMC, thus creating a new demand for melanosomes. The mitotic rate of basal keratinocytes increases a day after UV exposure, reaches a maximum 2 days later, and maintains this level for ∼1 wk. It then declines, and the skin regains its original thickness after 1–2 months if there has been no subsequent exposure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, for a light-skinned individual, light skin is normal, healthy, and appropriate. A tan represents response to a level of damage. When the damage ceases, the skin stops producing the unnecessary cells and the unnecessary pigmentation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there is any medical disadvantage of a high melanin level during periods of reduced sun exposure[?]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Darker skin is less conducive to production of Vitamin D. This is why Southern Asians living in northern European cities are more prone to Vitamin D deficiency.</p>

<p>Also, when exposed to UV radiation, melanin can itself become somewhat toxic to cells, the photosensitization generating superoxide radicals which can injure individual cells. So the risk having melanin must be outweighed by the protective effect of melanin against UV light. It's a delicate balance. </p>

<p>Continued exposure to UV light stimulates the melanocytes to grow. This increases the chance of the development of melanomas. Since skin cells containing melanin are shed (there's no getting around that), in light-skinned individuals, keeping a tan is to keep injuring the skin and risking carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>I'm referring to long-term use that is within or close to the manufacturer's recommendations (removing at night, cleaning, etc).</p>
","<p>Not all contacts are made the same even in the same pack. I have no idea what the acceptable level of failure is for contact manufacturers though. </p>

<p>Let's assume that you abide by all the usage instructions; that is, if they are monthly, weekly, or daily, you change them at that correct interval. Also, note that some contact lenses will have a longer life span with certain contact lens solutions. Off the top of my head, Air Optix is one of these brands. With this brand, you should be using Pure Moist I believe. Just following the boxes cleaning regiment will not suffice if you are using the wrong solution with the lenses. </p>

<p>Now, let's suppose you are doing everything correctly. Unfortunately, some lenses will not be up to par (such is engineering and in life not everything is perfect). Therefore, this set of lenses will become less breathable in a shorter amount of time. If you are the unlucky soul who perpetually gets the dud box, there can be negative side effects. One side effect is from ischemia which was mentioned in the comments. When the eye is starved of oxygen, blood vessels will begin to grow on the eye in order to get oxygen rich blood to the tissue and over time will cause Corneal Neovascularization.</p>

<p>The scenario I described is a long shot but it cold theoretically happen although it is very unlikely.</p>

<p>Other side effects could be that you get some kind of dirt or grim in your eye that gets under the contact lenses. This foreign body could end up scratching the cornea.</p>

<p>However, if you are diligent in following your eye care instructions, use the correct contact lenses solutions, and use common sense, more than likely, you will not have any problems from wearing contact lenses.</p>

"How do artificial sweeteners affect weight loss?","208","","<p>One common suggestion when trying to lose weight is to switch from sugary sodas and juices to zero-calorie drinks, such as water and diet soda.</p>

<p>Do the artificial sweeteners in diet products affect weight loss? Is there any benefit to choosing ""diet"" products instead over plain water?</p>
","<p>There has been a lot of debate over the topic of artificial sweeteners and weight loss. Some studies say that artificial sweeteners do promote weight loss, while others argue the complete opposite, that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain. </p>

<p><strong>Do artificial sweeteners in diet products affect weight loss?</strong></p>

<p>Most diet products use artificial sweeteners because they provide the sweetness of sugar without adding any extra calories. How this affects weight loss is uncertain. Several studies, both long term and short term, favor each side of the debate.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3190220?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"">A 1988 study<sup>1</sup></a> had two groups of obese men and women. Both groups were placed on the same diet, except that one group had aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in some diet products, added to the diet. Both groups also had regular exercise instruction. The men in both groups lost a significant amount of weight in the 12 week period, while the women, who also had good results, had more of a difference in the two groups, with the group whose diet was supplemented with aspartame losing about four more pounds on average. This showed that artificial sweeteners can help weight loss, but because the group was small (59), no firm conclusions could be drawn. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9022524?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"">Another similar study<sup>2</sup></a> also showed positive results in taking aspartame. In a group of 163 obese women, some of them assigned to have products with aspartame and some assigned to abstain from it, it was shown that having aspartame promoted more weight loss and allowed more weight control during a follow-up period. This study had more conclusive evidence than the previous study, but still not enough to be considered definite.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2349932?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg"">One more study<sup>3</sup></a> whose results leaned towards artificial sweeteners promoting weight loss (but still inconclusive) tested beverages with aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup (which I won't talk about because it's usually not used in diet products) on normal-weight men and women. The beverages with aspartame did appear, relative to when no beverages were given, to reduce weight in male subjects, but did not have a noticeable effect on females. Once again, this leaves us with an unsatisfactory result.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are some studies that say artificial sweeteners don't have any significant effect on weight or sometimes even promote weight gain. </p>

<p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2008.284/full"">A long-term study in San Antonio<sup>4</sup></a> studied a few thousand people and asked them how often they drank beverages with artificial sweeteners. The amount of total consumption of artificial sweeteners was then estimated. About 7 or 8 years later, the subjects were re-examined and it was found that higher consumption of artificial sweeteners may be linked with a higher body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. There are many other factors that could've changed this result, and they were handled as well as they could, but still not perfectly. Because of this, the result is once again inconclusive. The study article even says, ""There may be no causal relationship between [artificial sweetener] use and weight gain.""</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3714671"">One last study<sup>5</sup></a> also says that there is no evidence that artificial sweetener consumption ""helps weight loss or prevents weight gain."" It showed no significant link between weight loss or gain and the amount of artificial sweeteners consumed. Of course, this study has many variables that were handled as adequately as possible, but still this leads to the real result of the experiment being inconclusive. </p>

<p>As we can see, it is nearly impossible to tell how artificial sweeteners affect weight loss. They're not really bad for your health, so it is fine to have them. It does seem that the studies that showed weight loss from artificial sweetener consumption had a higher percentage of weight difference than the studies that showed other results. From this you may conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks. The only thing I can recommend is to have artificial sweeteners in moderation, just like anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any benefit to choosing ""diet"" products instead over plain water?</strong></p>

<p>This can also be a controversial subject, but there are also studies on it. Sadly, they are inconclusive.</p>

<p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.20737/full"">This study<sup>6</sup></a> tested men and women with two groups, one was an artificial sweetener beverage group and the other was a water group. Both groups also took part in a behavioral weight loss treatment program. The results showed that the artificial sweetener group lost more weight on average than the water group. Still, this study was not large enough and did not have sufficient enough evidence to be considered conclusive.</p>

<p>Whether diet products are better than water can still depend. You can argue the same as above that the benefits of artificial beverages outweigh the risks, but you could also say that water is a safe enough choice. This is usually up to whoever is debating between diet products and water, but your doctor can be contacted if the need is really felt. </p>

In several clinical trials (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873779"">1</a>, <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2009/04/01/ajcn.2009.26736H.short"">2</a>) Dr. Barnard has prooved that a low-fat vegan diet can improve serum values of <strong>HbA1c</strong> and requirements for medication of patients affected by type 2 diabetes. The same studies found significant improvements in <strong>plasma lipids</strong> (LDL and total cholesterols), that show decrease of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, often a complication of diabetes and metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Additionally, clinical trials show that vegan and vegetarian diets promote <strong>weight loss</strong> (<a href=""http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/9863851"">3</a>, <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934305002792"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506174"">5</a>) and improved <strong>insulin sensitivity</strong>(<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934305002792"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506174"">5</a>) being these two important risk factors for type 2 diabetes (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/risk-factors-for-diabetes"">6</a>).</p>

<p>The reasons of the effectiveness must be found in the fact -among others- that vegetarians and vegans eat less quantities of <strong>total fats</strong>, <strong>saturated fats</strong> and highers amounts of <strong>fiber</strong> and show lower <strong>BMI</strong> (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864"">7</a>).</p>

<p><a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1142908-overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MANY headaches are related to muscular/tendinous pain in the head and neck</a>, not the brain. Putting pressure on the temporal regions can cause pain in the muscles, and sustained pressure can cause spasms.  Restricting the flow through the arteries of your face could in theory reduce flow to muscles of your scalp, causing pain and ischemia.  It is less likely to be the cause of pain from sunglasses pressure, as there is lots of collateral blood flow, but not impossible.</p>

<p>Note that transmitting any force through the actual skull via compression, which is a pretty solid bone, would take a great deal of pressure (orders of magnitude above what sunglasses are capable of) and would involve fracturing bone. Then you'd be looking at potential stroke/TBI symptoms.  That is not happening to you.</p>

One day she was out with me in the sun, we were hugging each other and she suddenly said,""Ok, I'm feeling strange."". I looked at her forearms, they started showing little red dots like that in case of prickly heat rash. We weren't sure if it was the sun or it was something else.</p>

","<p>People can get allergy to sunlight. It is called photosensitivity or <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sun-allergy/basics/definition/con-20035077"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sun allergy</a>. The most common form of this is known as polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), also known as sun poisoning[1,2]. This is characterized by redness of the skin found on the arms, wrists, neck, and other areas. Here is a picture of this:</p>

<p>Based on your description, this is what is going on. Your friend has mild PMLE. Pheromones have nothing to do with this problem at all.</p>

<p>How does this happen? Scientists aren't fully sure. However, what we do know based on our knowledge of allergies is that the sun-exposed skin. The sun must be altering the skin in some way[2]. </p>

<p>How does this have to do with eosinophilia? Well, eosinophilia means there is more eosinophils and eosinophils are responsible for allergies, so there will be more allergic reactions to more things. However, eosinophilia and photo-sensitivity both are symptoms of drug allergy[3]. Perhaps your friend is allergic to some drug. For example, I found that eosinophilia and photosensitivity could be an allergy to Lisinopril[4]. I am not sure about the drug history of your friend so I cannot say anything more but she should go to the doctor for sure.</p>

"Is Forgetting certain spellings a sign of Alzheimer's","205","","<p>1) Is Forgetting certain spellings in English easy ones ( and remembering the tougher ones and other things like daily chores and etc) a sign for Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>2) Does Alzheimer's affect people below the age of 30.</p>

<p>3) Is there any research work  which states or which can be used to see if forgetting small spellings or dreaming certain alphabets ( which one hasn't drawn for 5 years) , but remembering other basic as well as advanced things a sign of depleting brain capacity .</p>
","<p>There are four cognitive symptom categories for Alzheimer's disease: aphasia, amnesia, apraxia, agnosia. These are broad categories that our brains handle somewhat separately. People frequently do sustain a brain injury to the left side of the head that damages his or her ability to process language and speech without affecting any other cognitive abilities. Our ability to utilize language is somewhat separate in the brain from areas responsible for the ability to reason, remember or use muscles. </p>

<p>So transient forgetting of spellings of common words would be processed in the language areas of the brain, and deficits of that ability are called Aphasia. </p>

<p>Forgetting daily chores falls into the category of Amnesia and is handled by a different area of the brain.</p>

<p>But your examples are about as non serious as they can get. Everyone has minor lapses in cognitive ability. So I'm hesitant to suggest seeing a doctor as I don't want to be blamed for a bunch of people getting laughed at when they go see their doctor for symptoms that lack of sleep may cause. Pose some more serious examples or extensive repeated lapses of forgetfulness or difficulty with words, or motor control, and I would have no problem suggesting you speak with a doctor. </p>

<p>Yes, Alzheimer's disease can happen to people in their late teens. But it is very rare. Most commonly onset of this condition is 40 or above.

<p>And I simply don't know enough about aphasia research to answer your third question. I suspect the answer may be out of scope for this forum, but I don't know. Perhaps someone else will. However I must also caution you that dementia is one of the most serious, but isn't the only cause of cognitive lapses.  </p>

"Tooth filling over an already decayed region?","205","","<p>For minor cases of tooth decay, the dentist drills out the decayed portion followed by filling the cavity.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>is it necessary to remove the decayed portion before the filling?</strong> What if the decayed part isn't removed/is partially removed? Will the decay continue spreading underneath the filling?</p>
","<p>Surprisingly, it might not always be necessary, </p>

<p>However, to make one thing clear, if we are talking about caries, the tooth is not merely decayed, it is infected by bacteria. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dental decay is due to the irreversible solubilization of tooth mineral by acid produced by certain bacteria that adhere to the tooth surface in bacterial communities known as dental plaque.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8259/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microbiology of Dental Decay and Periodontal Disease</a> (chapter of ""Medical Microbiology"") </p>

<p>There are multiple studies on what happens if not all of the infection is removed prior to tooth filling.

<blockquote>
  <p>Interference in environmental conditions by partial dentine caries removal and tooth sealing arrests lesion progression, suggesting that complete dentine caries removal is not essential to control caries progression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that as soon as the tooth is sealed, the infection doesn't spread deeper. One meta study reached the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on reviewed studies, incomplete caries removal seems advantageous compared with complete excavation, especially in proximity to the pulp. However, evidence levels are currently insufficient for definitive conclusions because of high risk of bias within studies.</p>

"Why does breathing stop during cardiac arrest?","204","","<p>I've been reading about resuscitation, and found several suggestions that people don't continue breathing after effective heart function stops because the diaphragm quickly runs out of oxygen.  Is this correct?</p>

<p>As best I can tell, current conventions are to continue to attempt resuscitation so long as brain stem cells are likely to stay alive, which, at normal body temperature, seems to be somewhere around 5 minutes after loss of pulse.</p>

<p>But while the brain stem is alive, does the respiration center not continue to (try to) breathe?  If so, does the diaphragm really use all of its blood's reserve oxygen in just a few breaths, and simply not have energy to breathe?  If not, is there some other effect that impairs breathing when the heart is not pumping effectively?  I <em>suspect</em> it's the latter, since otherwise CPR would never include respiration, and effective CPR would be evidenced by the subject's breathing.</p>
","<p>During approximately 50% of cardiac arrests, the patient continues to breathe for a time. However, this breathing is known as agonal respiration and is essentially gasping for air. This gasping is actually beneficial if CPR can be started while it is still occurring, it is believed that this may increase the chances of survival during a cardiac arrest incident and is better than any form of artificial respiration. This information was found on <a href=""http://heart.arizona.edu/gasping-not-breathing"" rel=""nofollow"">Sarver Heart Center's website</a>.</p>

<p>The most interesting and, I hope helpful, site I found was <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20489033"" rel=""nofollow"">PubMed.gov</a> which discussed this exact issue. In the article, they mention that it is not known for sure why cardiac arrest often leads very quickly (if not instantly) to apnea as the O2 levels in the brain stem don't drop immediately.</p>

<p>To sum things up a bit, it isn't known for sure why respiratory arrest often occurs at the same time as cardiac arrest, nor why cardiac arrest simply leads to agonal breathing initially in 50% of cases. </p>

"What influences vaginal odor?","202","","<p>Some women have an unpleasant vaginal odor. This can sometimes influence their sexual activity.</p>

<p>What influences this vaginal odor? Eating habits? Use of tampons?</p>

<p>What can be done to limit this vaginal odor?</p>
","<p><em>This is an interesting question, which comes frequently on Health SE.</em></p>

<p>First, here a small background on <strong>vaginal secretions</strong>:</p>

<p>More than 30 compounds have been described in the vaginal secretions. Several ""sources"" for those secretions have been indentified:  vulvar secretions from sebaceous, sweat, Bartholin and Skene glands, secretions from the endometrium, transudate from the vaginal walls and exfoliated cells from the vaginal mucosa. </p>

<p>Compounds of vaginal fluid are <strong>proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids</strong>. <strong><em>There is also a vaginal bacterial flora (such as vaginal lactobacilla) which produces organic acids as metabolic byproducts which can contribute to the vaginal odor.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>So what influences those odors?</strong></p>

<p>Certainly the menstrual cycle. Here an interesting study published some decades ago (more than > 30 years) in Science: </p>

<p>A research group sampled vaginal secretions in women and asked participants to ""sniff"" the bottle containing the secretions. They were then asked to evaluate the intensity and pleasantness of the odor's secretion. Here a graph of the variation in vaginal odor during a menstrual cycle:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4wit.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4wit.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see there is high variability, although slightly less unpleasant odor were noted in the preovulatory and ovulatory phase. So there is probably the <strong>role of sex hormones</strong> and an inter-individual variability</p>

<p>Infections or medications (in particular antibiotics) which alters the vaginal ecoflora, leading some bacteries to outpower other bacterias, which in turn leads to the production of other organic compounds, associated with different odors.</p>

<p>In women with bacterial vaginosis (= altered vaginal flora), one recent study has reported that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>increased dietary fat intake is associated with increased risk of BV
  and severe BV, whereas increased intake of folate, vitamin A, and
  calcium may decrease the risk of severe BV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so maybe diet can influence this vaginal odor.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>hygiene habits and sexual activity</strong> have also been linked to a change in vaginal flora, and might therefore lead to a change in vaginal odor.</p>

<p>As <strong>odor perception can be ""subjective""</strong> an inter-individual variability of its pleasantness should also be taken into account.</p>

"Is eating too much cholesterol bad?","197","","<p>I've been researching cholesterol a bit (my grandma is telling me off) and I've found some sites saying that eating cholesterol is not bad since you're body makes 75% of the cholesterol found in your body. That only 20-25% of the cholesterol in your body comes from food and that if you eat more, your body will cut down on its production of cholesterol.</p>

<p>However given that, would it be safe to say that that is only true if you don't eat more than 4 or 5 times the 'normal' amount of cholesterol? Since all the cholesterol is being provided for by food and your body is already not making any.</p>

<p>or if you eat over 100% does your body remove the additional cholesterol?</p>

<p>Basically my question is: is eating too much cholesterol bad for you?</p>
","<p>The current outlook is: Dietary cholesterol is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21690178"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">largely</a> a <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199108223250813"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-issue</a> still overburdened with much anxiety and even <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7730926"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hysteria</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>Dietary cholesterol comes exclusively from animal sources, thus it is naturally present in our diet and tissues. It is an important component of cell membranes and a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones and vitamin D. Contrary to phytosterols (originated from plants), cholesterol is synthesised in the human body in order to <strong>maintain a stable pool when dietary intake is low. Given the necessity for cholesterol,</strong> very effective intestinal uptake mechanisms and enterohepatic bile acid and cholesterol reabsorption cycles exist; conversely, phytosterols are poorly absorbed and, indeed, rapidly excreted. <strong>Dietary cholesterol content does not significantly influence plasma cholesterol values,</strong> which are regulated by different genetic and nutritional factors that influence cholesterol absorption or synthesis. <strong>Some subjects are hyper-absorbers and others are hyper-responders,</strong> which implies new therapeutic issues. <strong>Epidemiological data do not support a link between dietary cholesterol and CVD.</strong> Recent biological data concerning the effect of dietary cholesterol on LDL receptor-related protein may explain the complexity of the effect of cholesterol on CVD risk.

  <p>For much of the past 50 years, a great deal of the scientific literature regarding dietary fat and cholesterol intake has indicated a strong positive correlation with heart disease. In recent years, however, there have been a number of epidemiological studies that did not support a relationship between cholesterol intake and cardiovascular disease. Further, a number of recent clinical trials that looked at the effects of long-term egg consumption (as a vehicle for dietary cholesterol) reported no negative impact on various indices of cardiovascular health and disease. Coupled with data indicating that the impact of lowering dietary cholesterol intake on serum LDL levels is small compared with other dietary and lifestyle factors, there is a need to consider how otherwise healthy foods can be incorporated in the diet to meet current dietary cholesterol recommendations. Because eggs are a healthful food, it is particularly important that sensible strategies be recommended for inclusions of eggs in a healthy diet.</p>

"When to stretch as a sportsman","197","","<p>I've been hearing lots of contradictory message about stretching in relation to sports. </p>

<p>Some says that it's no use to stretch muscle before practicing physical activities while others always do it.</p>

<p>I do understand the benefits for after-effort stretching as a mean to alleviate muscle pain or cramps. I'm a regular runner and baseball player, should I encourage myself to stretch before practice?</p>
","<p>There are three main types of stretching that the general layman will be familiar with. There are a couple of others, but they are extreme techniques, and generally not used by the everyday athlete.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ballistic - The ""lean and bounce"" method, where you repeatedly bob back and forth in the stretch</li>
<li>Dynamic - Mimics the motion of the activity in increasing amplitude</li>
<li>Static - Traditional ""lean and hold"" type of stretching.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ballistic is old fashioned, and has been contraindicated for quite a while. One of the big risks is activating the stretch reflex in the tendon (This is what causes your knee to jerk when the doctor whacks you with the hammer), and this causes your muscle to try and tighten (shorten) at the same time you are actively lengthening it. This can produce tears, avulsions or tendon ruptures.</p>

<p>Dynamic is recommended before activity, especially if you are doing an activity that requires great extremes of motion (Such as martial arts or gymnastics). This is simply doing the motions of the sport starting with slow, short movements and gradually increasing the range and power. Skips into bounds before running is one example of this. As evidenced <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2008/11000/The_Acute_Effects_of_Dynamic_and_Ballistic.18.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">by this study</a>, dynamic stretching before activity showed greater gains in jump power, where ballistic and static stretching did not show the same gains.</p>

<p>Static should be done after activity if it is done. Several studies have shown that static stretching before activity (especially in power based activities) actually decreases performance. The main purpose of static stretching is to increase range of motion (ROM) in the area being stretched. <a href=""http://saudeemovimento.net.br/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/402_EFFECT_OF_STATIC_AND_BALLISTIC_STRETCHING_ON.PDF"" rel=""noreferrer"">This study</a> shows a decreased resistance to passive resistive torque (How far the joint can move before resistance begins), i.e. gains in flexibility with static where ballistic did not show the improvement. Ballistic did, however, reduce stiffness in the studied tendon (Achilles).</p>

<p>There is currently no evidence that stretching will alleviate muscle pain, and while it is popular to do, not much evidence that it helps alleviate cramps, either. Static stretching (contrary to popular belief) has also not been proven to reduce injury rates (<a href=""http://www.gytk.sote.hu/gyki/Oktatok/Horpet/Bozot_suggested_article.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">As shown by this review article of the literature</a>) or assist with such things as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), ""flush"" lactate out of the muscles, or anything. If it helps relax you, or if you need extreme ranges of motion for a specific sport, it can help, but other than that, there isn't much evidence for it to support performance increases.</p>

<p>Also, since you mention that you play baseball, there is some evidence (Although I can't find the study at the moment) that preswing warmups should be done with a lightweight bat rather than a weighted bat, as it helps increase the following swing speeds.</p>

<p>Addition: While reading through references, I did find some notations that ballistic stretching post exercise could possibly produce greater gains in flexibility, at the cost of a higher injury risk.</p>

"Is having a congenitally fused heart valve a hereditary condition?","196","","<p>A person (close to me genetically) recently had a surgery to replace an aortic heart valve that the surgeon called ""the ugliest valve he'd seen in a long time"".  Two of the leaflets were fused together, which the doctor said could have been since birth.</p>

<p>I am wondering if this condition is known to be hereditary.</p>
","<p>Short answer: Yes. </p>

<p><strong>Fused leaflets?</strong><br>
The condition you’re referring to is known as Congenital <a href=""http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/heart/disorders/valve/bicuspid_aortic_valve_disease"" rel=""nofollow"">bicuspid aortic valve</a> (BAV). It is the most common congenital heart valve abnormality, present in 1-2% of live births. Normally there are three leaflets (a.k.a. cusps) comprising the aortic valve. BAV refers to the situation when there are only two cusps, a hemodynamically less favorable scenario. </p>

<p>Although generally benign in itself, BAV has been associated with an increased risk of several serious complications. In particular, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_stenosis"" rel=""nofollow"">aortic stenosis</a>, a condition in which the blood flow exiting the heart is limited by a narrowed valve, is more common in individuals with BAV and often occurs at a younger age. Aortic stenosis in BAV patients is also frequently accompanied by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">aortic insufficiency</a>, back flow through the valve. Both properties reflect the anatomic descriptor you give: <strong>ugly</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Is BAV hereditary?</strong><br>
Yes. This can be demonstrated by looking at familial clustering of the condition. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9385911"" rel=""nofollow"">In one study</a>, the researchers started with thirty patients diagnosed by echocardiography with congenital BAV.* All first-degree relatives were contacted, and 90% of them agreed to undergo echocardiography. Of those, 9% were found to have BAV. This is significantly higher than the baseline population risk (~1%). The distribution was compatible with an <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">autosomal dominant</a> inheritance pattern with incomplete <a href=""http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=penetrance"" rel=""nofollow"">penetrance</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234422"" rel=""nofollow"">A more recent study</a> used fancy math to determine the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"" rel=""nofollow"">heritability</a> of BAV.** They found that 89% of the risk for BAV is due to heritable factors. </p>

"What causes body parts to fall asleep?","196","","<p>Throughout my life, I've had body parts fall asleep (mostly my feet). I get a weird sensation called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"" rel=""nofollow"">Paresthesia</a>, or ""pins and needles"". Though it goes away after a some time, I hate the several minutes that I do have because it is very uncomfortable. I always thought they were caused by just inactivity, but I realized that I've had lots of times when my feet have been inactive for hours (mostly when I'm sleeping, but a lot of times when I'm working too) but I never get pins and needles.</p>

<p>So my question is, <strong>What causes body parts to fall asleep?</strong></p>
","<p>Paresthesia can be caused by inactivity, sustained pressure on the nerve, neurological disorder, or nerve damage. </p>

<p>If the causes is from pressure, the user <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5694/v-ix"">V_ix</a> on Biology gave the following answer <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/16082/12909"">here</a> which I have quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Underneath the superficial layers of your skin there are receptors which sense pressure, temperature and pain. These receptors are part of the peripheral nervous system which senses stimuli and they take the message conveying details about the stimulus to the somatosensory cortex of the brain. Here is where the perception of pain, burning, pressure etc is ultimately made. To take the simplest example, if you stop blood flow for a short amount of time in a limb, these receptors are activated, and will send signals to the brain that are interpreted as tingling or numbness. With more severe pain, different receptors are activated which , again, project to the same brain area but a different message is read out. If the pressure from one limb is removed, the receptors will go back to normal function as blood flow is restored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If what you experience is chronic, you may need to see your healthcare provider in order to rule out a neurological disorder or nerve damage. You can find more information on paresthesia from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as well as clinical trials if you are really concerned about this on their site:</p>

"Causes of hypertension in young, healthy patient?","195","","<p>What are some of the causes of elevated systolic blood pressure in an otherwise young, healthy and asymptomatic patient?</p>
","<p>Probably some of the more common causes would be poor diet and lack exercise. Not everyone who eats poorly and doesn't exercise will be over weight since genetics plays a role. That is, a young adult can appear to be healthy but be internally suffering. Another question would be is this otherwise health individual a smoker?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two recent studies confirm the blood pressure benefits of maintaining a healthy diet. First is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical study, which tested the effects of food nutrients on blood pressure. It emphasizes consumption of fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy foods, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and stresses reduction of fats, red meats, sweets, and sugared beverages.</p>
  
  <p>Second is the DASH-sodium study, which demonstrates the importance of lowering sodium (salt) intake. Most Americans consume far more than the current, daily recommendation of 2,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium—about a teaspoon of table salt—or less. This includes all salt and sodium consumed, not just at the table, but also in cooking. For those with high blood pressure, consuming even less may be advisable, since the DASH-sodium study revealed that diets containing no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day had still greater pressure-lowering effects.</p>
  
  <p>Regular physical activity is another good step toward controlling or even preventing high blood pressure. Start with 30 minutes of moderate-level activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling or gardening on most—preferably all—days of the week. The activity even may be divided into three, 10-minute periods each. For added benefit, these moderate half-hours may be increased or supplanted by regular, vigorous exercise. Of course, prior to upping the activity level, people should check with their physicians, especially if they have had heart trouble or a previous heart attack, a family history of heart disease at an early age, or other serious health problems.</p>

She is on vacation now so I cannot contact her, but she mentioned that before I start Acutane that I need to stop taking my Minocycline and Spirnolactone, but I can't recall how far in advance that is. Is it a month or two weeks? (Also, yes, I know that I need to take a blood test at the start of the month and be on birth control and sign the ""I pledge"" and all that jazz). Thanks!</p>
","<p>This is a very interesting, yet tricky, question. The reason you must stop taking the minocycline is because of the interaction between tetracyclines (minocycline) and vitamin A (Retinoic acid) derivatives (isotretinoin/Accutane) causes a pseudotumor cerebri also known as increased intracranial pressure, which can be deadly.</p>

<p>Now when taking spironolactone and isotretinoin, I don't see a problem per se, as far as interactions go. However, maybe your doctor doesn't want you to endure any of spironolactone's side effects as it will be minimally effective in treating the acne <strong>by comparison</strong> to the isotretinoin.</p>

"Are bread molds dangerous to ingest?","194","","<p>I will occasionally notice minor molds developing on bread I've left for a few days at room temperature. Often, there will be some mold noticeable on a few pieces, while other pieces are fine.</p>

<p>I know next to nothing about molds in general. Aside from the ""ick"" factor, is consuming a piece of bread with a small amount of mold on it dangerous? What adverse health effects (if any) could result?</p>
","<p>There are a couple concerns with eating food with mold on it:</p>

<ol>
<li>The growth of mold implies that microbial contaminants can grow on the food, which means there is a potential for spoilage even if the mold itself isn't pathogenic.</li>
<li>The mold itself can cause health problems.

</ol>

<p>The most common health threats from the mold itself are likely exposure to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflatoxin"">mycotoxins</a> or allergic reactions - consider, for example, that penicillin is a mold that can grow on bread, and also causes fairly serious allergic reactions.</p>

"What are the health risks of drinking Diet Coke while chewing Mentos?","193","","<p>I assume many of you are aware what happens when you drop Mentos into Diet Coke bottle:</p>

<p>However, that Wikipedia article does not mention what happens if this eruption happens inside a person, i.e. someone drinking Diet Coke while chewing a Mentos gum.</p>

<p>What will happen, and what are the health risks, if any?</p>
","<p>There is a myth that drinking Diet Coke while chewing Mentos causes your stomach to explode, though this has been disproved by <a href=""http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/diet-coke-and-mentos-make-stomach-explode/"" rel=""nofollow"">MythBusters</a> and <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/mentos.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Snopes</a>. Both sources say that the reason for the explosion between Diet Coke and Mentos is because of the outside of the Mentos reacting with the Diet Coke. If the Mentos are still in your mouth, the Diet Coke will most likely explode, but if they are in your stomach, they won't cause an explosion, but they still may cause <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6xXngYnVK8&amp;t=1m58s"" rel=""nofollow"">a lot of burping</a>. Still, none of those sources are very reliable, so I'm going to have to prove how it works chemically.</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/chemistry/outreach/MSP_AU_web/documents/AJP_2008_diet_coke_mentos_Coffey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">study</a> testing the reaction states that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It is clear...that the roughness

  the reaction.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/original-mentos-diet-coke-geyser/"" rel=""nofollow"">Steve Spangler Science experiment page</a> also agrees that the surface of the candy is an incredibly important factor in the Diet Coke/Mentos reaction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you drop the Mentos into the soda, the gelatin and gum arabic from the dissolving candy break the surface tension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that is indeed the surface of the Mentos that causes such a reaction. So, it can be seen that if you eat the Mentos and they are in your stomach, the surface of the Mentos begins to break down, so it makes sense why there would be just burping, rather than an explosion (like in the YouTube video above). If the Mentos are still in your mouth, the surface has probably been already slightly broken down, but there would still be an explosion, just to a slightly smaller extent.</p>

"Is dental floss really effective? According to studies, it is not","192","","<p>Recently I had to go through a lot of ultrasound teeth cleaning because my gums suffered inflammations in the past. I am doing the dental cleaning every 3 to 4 months and every time the dentist says that the gum is getting better and better because I am flossing thoroughly. Before the inflammation, I never flossed so this is kind of a novel procedure for me. </p>

<p>So I empirically assumed that flossing is really the thing that helps to heal, as also acknowledged by the dentist. </p>

<p>The thing is... there are actually no studies to prove this statement. I have looked for articles and I found for instance <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36962667"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""https://apnews.com/f7e66079d9ba4b4985d7af350619a9e3/medical-benefits-dental-floss-unproven"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.ada.org/en/science-research/science-in-the-news/the-medical-benefit-of-daily-flossing-called-into-question"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. I understand from the articles that there is not sufficient proof to endorse the procedure. Despite this, the dentists still recommend flossing.</p>

<p>From one of the articles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence for flossing is “weak, very unreliable,” of “very low” quality, and carries “a moderate to large potential for bias.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What should one understand from this? Is there someone here that works in this field or did some research on this issue? </p>

<p>The reason why I ask this is that I want to eliminate using the floss and replace it with WaterPik, which I find more comfortable, fast and less abrasive. But I have also seen articles in which they write that floss is better than WaterPik. So then I come back to the same issue...</p>

<p>I would also like to know if the dental ultrasound cleaning is actually the one healing me or is the flossing? Can anyone help me with this?</p>
","<p>Is dental floss really effective?
The evidence shows that we don't know. Here the main issue is the lack of good evidence. </p>

<p>How we find how effective is? Simple: we took a group of people with similar age, similar dental status, and divide randomly to one group who will use floss and other who don't. Then, we wait for one, two or five years and compare caries and periodontal disease. </p>

<p>This is the theory. </p>

<p>In practice, there is <strong>no experimental trials</strong> like this. All that we have are <strong>observational studies</strong> tracking the oral health of people who floss and people who don't. Hence, sometimes we see that people who floss have better oral health that people who dont and sometimes the contrary. For example, if we ask @jess, we will record the he floss AND he have periodontal issues.</p>

<p>The main issue with observational evidence is that, maybe, for some reason, the people who floss is essentially different from the people who don't. For example maybe the people who floss eat more vegetables and that is the reason why they have better oral health. Or, on the contrary, maybe the people who floss have more periodontal problems, and in such case we will find the opposite, that floss is correlated with periodontal disease. </p>

<p>Is hard to extract conclusions from observational evidence and that is the conclusion of most systematic reviews: we don't have evidence that indicate that floss is effective. <strong>But</strong> also we don't have evidence showing that floss is ineffective. </p>

<p>Hence, is wise to ask your dentist for your personal condition, taking in consideration all your particular characteristics and follow her/his advice. </p>

"Tourniquet application on a venous bleed","192","","<p>A few weeks ago in class (EMT), we were discussing tourniquet application in instances where there is bleeding that couldn't be controlled by pressure. In most cases, a tourniquet will be used on a limb that has arterial bleeding as opposed to venous. And in the case of arterial bleeding, the tourniquet will be applied proximal (above) to the injury.</p>

<p>However, I began to wonder if one had to use a tourniquet to control a venous bleed where the tourniquet would be applied. Since venous blood is flowing back to the heart, couldn't the tourniquet be applied distal to the injury? </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Theoretically, this is an injury in which <em>only</em> a vein has been injured but the bleeding cannot be stopped through traditional methods. </p>
","<p>In venous lacerations, blood would be able to be stopped by placing a tourniquet below the injury. By stopping the blood from returning from the limb, you wouod be able to effectively prevent blood loss. This would work in the rare case of just the vein being cut, but it's safer to place the tourniquet above the injury in case the vein is not the only thing cut.</p>

","<p>Many sleeping pills are addictive.
Many non-addictive sleeping pills can be mentally addictive.</p>

<p>If you do not mind using sleeping pills for the rest of your life, then that is a perfectly fine choice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you may want to consider other options first.</p>

<p>Exercise will help. Use up your energy and your body will WANT sleep. Exercise is key to your body's cycles.<br>
Your circadian rhythm (sleeping cycle) is largely affected by light. Particularly, artificial light gives off a lot of light in the frequency range that causes your body to think its NOT time to sleep and will screw up your cycles. When you know you have time to sleep, stay away from staring at computer screens as much as possible.<br>
Stay away from stimulants. i.e. caffeine or whatever else you may use throughout the day/night.</p>

<p>The huge factor here is that you said you have no official known work hours and you go in whenever they ask you to. <br>If that means that you never know when you might have a good 6-8 hours of sleeping time, then there really is no way to ""fix your cycles"" since it is a constantly moving unknown. Sleeping pills <em>MAY</em> be the only realistic answer in that case. <br>However, if you are able to figure out times when you know you will be off work for a certain number of hours more often than not, then you have a good chance of trying to fix your sleeping cycle.</p>

The ball would not be appropriate for people who have problems with their ankles/feet as they would be required to stabilize themselves through the entire lower kinetic chain before they can do it safely. </p>

<p>Basically, the ball is just a progression of the exercises that should initially be done on the floor/bed. Pending the stage of the patient's recovery and overall status, they can then progress to the ball. Resistance can then be added by carrying free weights or using elastic theraband. Hope this helps! </p>

"What are some ways to stop and prevent acne?","189","","<p>I sleep on my back and have acne there. What can I do to keep the acne from getting worse and prevent future acne from developing? (I'm not sure if sleeping position matters.)</p>
","<p>While I cannot comment on the issue of laying on your back causing acne, I hope my answer helps with your concern for prevention. </p>

<p>There is some evidence that glycemic index (GI) is related to more severe acne. One study examining the diets of 287 people from ages 18-25 with no, mild or severe acne, found that those with worse acne had greater dietary (glycemic index). The foods which were significantly different among groups included servings of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Milk (with non-fat milk having more of an effect than whole milk)</li>
<li>Saturated fat</li>
<li>Trans Fat</li>
<li>Fish (indicating higher fish consumption in those with no or less severe acne)</li>
<li>Fruit and fruit juice equivalents (presumably because fruit juice has added sugar making them high GI foods)</li>
</ol>

<p>The authors propose that GI is related to acne development because of the effect on Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 or (IGF-1), but also highlight conflicting evidence. I will avoid further biological discussion of how this is thought to happen in the body because that is not your question.</p>

<p>The authors do propose that milk may be related to worse acne because it contains IGF-1 and its insulinemic response is much higher than would be expected because of its glycemic load alone so they hypothesize that the IGF-1 leads to (with a few steps omitted) greater sebaceous lipogenesis and sebum output, leading to acne.</p>

<p>The authors also comment on the negative relationship between fish consumption and hypothesize that n-3 polyunsaturated  fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids) have a protective effect against acne.</p>

<p>Study limitations include that the data are self-reported as was the acne severity. </p>

<p>A recent review of the dietary and acne literature indicated that there haven't been any randomized controlled trials that can conclude causally that high glycemic load, dairy and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have an effect on acne. The evidence is more convincing for glycemic load, and less robust or conclusive for milk and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

<p>The aforementioned data are inconclusive but worth taking note to see if reduction of these foods benefit your acne. See <a href=""https://www.dovepress.com/linking-diet-to-acne-metabolomics-inflammation-and-comedogenesis-an-up-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID#ref156"">this</a> for a in-depth discussion of the above issues.</p>

"What is the healthiest way to drink excessively and chronically?","188","","<p>If someone who is otherwise healthy decided to drink fairly heavily and consistently over a long period of time, what is the healthiest way to do so?</p>

<p>Example: Stay extra hydrated by drinking more water, take a multivitamin, get more sleep, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously the best solution would be to cease drinking, but IF that person is stubborn and won't quit - what's the best way to go about it?</p>
","<p>Basically, most of what you suggested. </p>

<p>One of the big risks of alcohol consumption is damage to the liver. Thus, if drinking a lot, don't do anything else that damages the liver, like taking medication that can itself lead to liver damage. The most common drug that this includes is acetaminophen (paracetamol). </p>

<p>The next important thing is to get the alcohol to be delivered into the blood (and liver) slowly. That means eating before drinking, drinking slowly, and not taking any medication that worsens the effect of alcohol. </p>

<p>And then comes reducing its effects and speeding up recovery. Drink enough additional fluids (water, juices, etc) before, during and after drinking alcohol. Get enough sleep and give your body time to recover. </p>

<p>With regular alcohol consumption comes vitamin deficiencies. A multivitamin with folate, vitamin B6, thiamine, and vitamin A might help. Iron deficiency and anemia are common, getting enough iron in the diet or through a multivitamin can help with that. </p>

<p>There are lots of things long-term alcohol abuse can cause that can't be treated like this, though. Seizures, nerve damage, pancreatitis, etc. </p>

<p>All in all, I <strong>really, really</strong> recommend against it, but in this hypothetical scenario, the steps above might reduce the damage done to the body. </p>

"What are the health risks of consuming 6-8 liters (1.5-2 gallons) of water daily?","187","","<p>Are there any health risks of consuming large quantities of water at a time or throughout the day?</p>
","<p><strong>Summary</strong>     </p>

<p>The primary risk of excessive water intake is hyponatremia (low sodium level in the blood). While a healthy person who drinks 6-8 liters of water daily is unlikely to suffer significant hyponatremia, people who drink this much often have psychiatric illness that is accompanied by poorly understood hormonal changes that may indeed cause hyponatremia and its attendant symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Psychogenic polydipsia</strong>  </p>

<p>Many patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders drink more water than normal. This is termed psychogenic polydipsia. The cause is unknown.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p><strong>Hyponatremia: mechanism</strong>  </p>

<p>Sodium levels correlate closely with serum osmolality, since sodium is the primary cation contributing to osmotic pressure. The body maintains serum osmolality within a narrow range via regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, a.k.a. arginine vasopressin), a hormone that is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland (a.k.a. neurohypophysis) at the base of the brain in response to a rise in serum osmolality. The hormone circulates in the blood and acts in the kidneys to increase free water resorption, thereby lowering serum osmolality. In the case of excess free water, ADH secretion will be maximally suppressed. </p>

<p>In a healthy person, ADH suppression results in urine diluted to a concentration of about 60 mmol/kg,<sup>4</sup> which (assuming a normal glomerular filtration rate) corresponds to a fluid intake of about 28 L per day. Only above that level with serum osmolality be significantly compromised.</p>

<p><strong>SIADH</strong>   </p>

<p>Unfortunately, many people can not suppress ADH maximally. As a result, urine may be ‘inappropriately’ compromised in the face of falling serum osmolality. This is called, creatively, Syndrome of Inappropriate Diuretic Hormone (SIADH). For reasons that are incompletely understood, many psychiatric patients with psychogenic polydipsia (see below) have SIADH.<sup>3</sup> Some of the reasons that are understood: </p>

<ul>
<li>Medications including antidepressants (primarily SSRIs) and antipsychotics are well-established causes of SIADH.  </li>
<li>Schizophrenia itself appears to be associated with SIADH. </li>
<li>Chronic hyponatremia may lead to a ‘reset osmostat’ whereby the pituitary's threshold for ADH secretion is changed. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hyponatremia: consequences</strong></p>

<p>The constellation of symptoms associated with hyponatremia is termed hyponatremic encephalopathy.<sup>3</sup> It includes: headache, blurred vision, weakness, muscle tremor and cramps, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, confusion. This can progress, in severe cases, to seizures, coma, and death. It would be exceedingly rare for a person with purely psychogenic polydipsia to progress to this point (in part because one is likely to develop depressed consciousness and stop drinking such that the kidney can fix the problem prior to dying). </p>

<p>One important point is that the level of hyponatremia required to cause these symptoms is largely dependent on the rapidity of change. Acute hyponatremia can cause symptoms at a level of 128-130 mEQ/L (normal 135-145 mEq/L). On the other hand, patients with chronic SIADH may walk around with sodium 120-125 mEq/L without symptoms. </p>

"Can pectus excavatum increase the risk of cardio vascular disease?","186","","<p>With Pectus Excavatum the sternum is sunken inwards pushing organs slightly out of their normal position. My question is could this repositioning put additional pressure on the heart over time leading to an increased risk of cardio vascular disease or other circulatory related problems? </p>
","<p><em>This is a very interesting question. Thank you.</em></p>

<p><strong>Just as a small background on pectus excavatum (PE)</strong> (also known as ""funnel chest""). It is characterised by depression of the sternum that begins over the midportion of the manubrium and progressing inward through the xiphoid process:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dpZP9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dpZP9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19048741"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this study conducted in 947 patients</a>, the most frequent symptoms of PE are:</p>

<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Poot endurance</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>could this repositioning put additional pressure on the heart over
  time leading to an increased risk of cardio vascular disease or other
  circulatory related problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>. Several studies based on echocardiography have shown that, most of the patients with PE have <strong>cardiac displacement to the left side and hence right ventricular dysfunction (which explains the shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, etc...)</strong>. Patients often show <strong>right ventricular outflow obstruction</strong> and reduced right ventricular systolic function (particularly in patients with severe PE). The cardiac displacement and compression may lead to <strong>conduction abnormalities</strong>, such as bundle branch block.</p>

<p><strong>Noteworthy, surgical treatment is associated with an improvement of these cardiac abnormalities and hence symptoms.</strong></p>

"Do we have a general system of class of drugs that a layman can understand?","186","","<p>When I was reading the accepted answer in the <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/307/99"">Why do doctors prescribe steroid tablets even though they know the side effects?</a> question, I noticed this phrase located in the second paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...if there is a single <strong>class of drugs</strong>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what class of drugs we have. So I started researching and got to the <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/drug-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Drug Classes</a> page on Drugs.com. But I don't understand a word. And even if I can understand them, there are so many classes that I cannot remember them all. Do we have another class system that is more general and less number of classes? If there is not, which classes should I know as a layman?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: while I know nothing about medical, in my high school I used to study natural sciences very well, which include biology and chemistry.</p>
","<p>There is no need for any person to learn any drug taxonomy, unless this person is creating or extensively using clinical or pharmacological documentation. I don't doubt that somewhere, a single unified taxonomy of drugs exists, prescribed by some standardization body - and I also don't doubt that it's a major pain to use and as hated by physicians as ICD-10. </p>

<p>For all medical purposes outside of documentation, people use <a href=""http://www.amazon.de/Women-Fire-Dangerous-Things-Categories/dp/0226468046"">categorization</a> the same way they do it for all other concepts in their life. They put a label on any group they (and hopefully their communication partner) readily recognize. And what they recognize depends on their level of expertise in the field. </p>

<p>This is why you, the patient, will naturally say ""drugs for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"">migraine</a>"" while talking to a friend of physician. A physician will use categories such as ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_receptor_agonist"">serotonin receptor agonists</a>"". Neither of you two studied a taxonomy tree of drugs before using a correct category name. You knew ""there are migraines"" and derived a proper category name from it. The physician learned about the role of serotonin in the brain, and one chapter of his textbook explained how serotonin is connected to migraine, and another explained how there are drugs which mimic the effects of serotonin by activating the same receptors which are usually activated by serotonin, so they can stop a migraine. </p>

<p>Note that the two categories are not the same, even though they have some overlap. Some serotonin receptor agonists are a type of migraine drugs. But there are migraine drugs which are not serotonin receptor agonists, and there are serotonin receptor agonists which do something other than heal migraine, because they activate a slightly different set of serotonin receptors. But there is no simple way to translate the category ""serotonin receptor agonists"" to layman's terms. It's not even a matter of it resulting from too detailed criteria, and saying that it's good for a layman to learn the more general category above it - because the more general category of ""receptor agonist"" is not easier to understand. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1591842948"">Experts' taxonomies are not simply more detailed versions of a layman's taxonomy of the same area, they are orthogonal to laymen taxonomies, because they are based on completely different principles.</a> </p>

<p>If what you want is a categorization system reflecting your current knowledge, then you already have it. Talking about ""drugs for fever"" or ""drugs for migraine"" is not wrong in any way. Just say whatever you mean when you need it. There could be a category which you need to talk about but cannot come up with a succinct name for it, such as ""drugs for fever which are safe for toddlers and are taken through the mouth"" - but it is unlikely that it already makes a node in somebody else's standardized taxonomy, you have to describe it. And while your doctor might be inclined to use the description ""pediatric oral antipyretic"" instead, this does not make your label less valid. </p>

<p>If you want to be able to work with a more intricate taxonomy, you'll need more medical knowledge. And that's great - everybody can use knowledge about such an important subject. But in this case, the knowledge comes first. Using the correct taxonomy will come naturally, as a byproduct of your increased knowledge. The other way round does not work. </p>

<p>Of course, it can happen that you come across information which refers to a category you don't understand, for example in the list of interactions of a drug you are taking. But if you want to understand this information, the way is not through some special taxonomy (which cannot be mapped to concepts you already know anyway). If you really need to know what makes a class of drug a ""class"" and not a random collection of drugs, and a source you find does not explain it in terms you understand, you need another source which will try to explain the criteria behind the existing expert's category. I'm sure the users of this site will be happy to help you in this, too. </p>

<p>For HSV specifically, the antibody tests are known not to be 100% accurate. The main failure is for lack of detection, not for false positive. See <a href=""http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/Supplement_2/S173.full"" rel=""nofollow"">oxford journals</a></p>

<p>Many people get HSV (1 or 2), have one minor reaction, which they may not even notice, and that's it for the rest of their live, no further issues. Only a small percentage of the population have continual issues. This applies to many other viruses</p>

<p>You can probably also say that close to 100% of people will carry the HSV virus by their time of death. So don't worry about it</p>

"Can Manual External Defibrillators ""restart"" a heart?","185","","<p>On TV it appears that every time a heartbeat monitor flat-lines they pull out the paddles of a manual external defibrillator (MED) and give a few shocks, often explicitly cranking up the output when an initial charge doesn't restore a heartbeat.</p>

<p>My technical understanding of this is that a MED is <em>only</em> indicated when the cause of the heart ""stopping"" is some form of fibrillation or arrhythmia.  Granted, maybe ""off-screen"" is an electrocardiograph the EMT is referencing.  But if not, would an EMT ever use a MED if the only thing he knew was that a person had no pulse?</p>

<p>Or, is it the case that a heart will <em>only</em> stop due to either fibrillation or arrhythmias that a MED can reverse?</p>

<p>What if a subject <em>does</em> have a steady heartbeat: Can a MED <em>stop</em> a beating heart?</p>

<p>I suppose that if a subject has no pulse one might argue that the MED can't <em>hurt</em>.  But is a MED a substitute for CPR?  E.g., if you had a MED and <em>no better information</em> on the patient would you apply both MED shocks <em>and</em> CPR, or what is the current best practice?</p>

<p>Back to TV depictions: They almost always show the subject of MED arching his back for roughly a full second when the charge is applied.  I've never seen a real MED application, but my understanding is the pulse is only supposed to last 12ms.  Also, since it is applied across the chest, the skeletal muscles most prone to contract would presumably be the chest and upper abdominals, which would (if anything) cause the exact opposite contraction, and only for an instant.</p>
","<p>Your technical understanding is correct and television is fiction. In fact, watching shows involving CPR and defibrillation is a source of both amusement and frustration for most medical professionals because it is almost always portrayed wildly inaccurately.</p>

<p>Defibrillation is effective against only ventricular fibrillation (VF or V-Fib, which is when the heart is beating too irregularly for effective blood circulation too occur) and <em>pulseless</em> ventricular tachycardia (VT or V-Tach, which is when the heart is beating too fast for effective circulation). Automated defibrillators simply will not shock other rhythms, including asystole (""flat line""). No one trained to use a manual defibrillator would do so either.</p>

<p>Yes, a defibrillator can definitely stop a beating heart. However, if that heart started out healthy and hasn't been injured, then it's quite likely it will restart on its own due to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_action_potential#Autorhythmicity"" rel=""nofollow"">autorhythmicity</a> of cardiac cells. This is why <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioversion"" rel=""nofollow"">cardioversion</a> can be used to treat arrhythmias with relative safety. A cardioversion is simply a defibrillation of the heart timed to coincide precisely with a safe point in the heart rhythm. </p>

<p>Interestingly, there was even one case of an <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2819293"" rel=""nofollow"">unsuccessful suicide attempt using a defibrillator</a>. Had the nurse followed his training and applied the paddles to his chest instead of his head, he might have succeeded.</p>

<p>Although the ""it can't hurt"" logic is tempting, the fact is that inappropriate defibrillation <em>can</em> hurt. If the patient is in asystole, defibrillation merely reduces the already very small chances of restoring a heartbeat. If the patient is in some rhythm other than VF or VT, defibrillation may stop their heart, or put them into VF or VT. It simply isn't done no matter what you might see on Doogie Howser, MD.</p>

She was calm and mostly non-interactive, but would just lie there staring at the ceiling, or talking softly to her stuffed animals, or playing with her fingers; finding ways to while away the time because she couldn't sleep.  When she finally did fall asleep, she would often wake again during the night, and then would have the same trouble falling asleep again, resulting in a severe lack of sleep.</p>

<p>In consultation with her doctor, we began giving her melatonin about 1/2 hour before we put her into bed.  We started with 1mg, and then, when that didn't seem to be enough, we upped the dose to 2mg (again, as per her doctor).
We have found that it works amazingly well, and gives her the ability to fall asleep quickly and to sleep through the night and feel well-rested in the morning.</p>

<p>We've been doing this for about 2 months now.</p>

<p>There have been a couple of nights where we forgot to give her the melatonin, or just decided to see how she does without it, and it's immediately right back to the hours of non-sleep, so there's little chance that she can sleep well without it, at least in the near future.</p>

<p>In researching melatonin online, it seems that there isn't a lot known about its long-term effects, and some websites warn that using it for children can cause problems for them later in life.</p>

<p>I want my daughter to be able to sleep well, but I also don't want to do anything that may harm her, now or in the future, so I'm a little concerned about continuing to use the melatonin, since it appears she may need it for a while.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Do I need to be concerned about continuing to give her the 2mg of melatonin every night?</em></strong> </p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Are there long-term effects I should be concerned about?</em></strong></p>
  
  <p><strong><em>If it's not recommended, are there alternatives to melatonin that might have a similar effect of helping her to get to sleep and to stay asleep?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Since melatonin is secerned by many glands (pituitary, thyroid, pineal, adrenals, and gonads), it might be a malfunction of one of these. I am not yet a physician, but I suggest you to try to properly address underlying causes. Maybe melatonin supplements are just a palliative which helps controlling symptoms of something else, like an adenosine lack.</p>

<p>That said, let's get to the science: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3111733/"">This study</a> states that, in relation to development delay risks,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...]Melatonin treatment in children can be sustained over a long period of time without substantial deviation of the development of children with respect to sleep quality, puberty development and mental health scores[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it apparently is safe to use it on a regular basis. Just remember it's not helpful when there are wake-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night problems, which are often not idiopathic, they mean something, be it a psychological, health, or anything-else related issue.</p>

"Medical puzzle: can blood flow in arteries be non-pulsatile?","184","","<p>Recently there have been questions on blood pressure and pulse pressure on this forum. Can the blood flow in arteries of a living human be non-pulsatile (i.e. not producing a pulse)? That is, the flow is continuous and at constant pressure, the systolic and diastolic being equal and pulse pressure being zero. Evidently, such people will not have a pulse since arteries are always distended at constant pressure.</p>
","<p>No, not in a normal human (non surgical intervention) simply because of the mechanism of how the blood is pushed through the body.</p>

<p>It isn't like a faucet, where you have constant pressure and regulate by opening or closing a valve in varying degrees. The heart has 4 chambers that alternately relax and fill, then squeeze and empty.</p>

<p>The arterial pulse is from the left side of the heart. Oxygenated blood enters into the left atrium, and from there it is pushed into the left ventricle. When this portion of the heart contracts, this is what pushed blood out through the arteries to deliver oxygen to various systems (organs, muscles, skin, etc.) This surge is what you feel when you articulate a pulse.</p>

<p>However, Yes it is possible in a surgical intervention which has been pointed out. There are LVAD's (Left Ventricular Assist Device) which will produce a pulseless human. When reading up on it, I did find an interesting study that suggests <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109714075822"">LVAD use may stimulate heart regeneration</a>.</p>

"Digesting liquid food vs solid food equivalent","183","","<p>I am curious to find out what happens during the digestion of solid food or liquid food compared with each other.</p>

<p>For example, what takes longer to digest and what takes longer before feeling hungry again: eating a bowl of butternut squash soup vs eating the ingredients separately as solids.</p>

<p>Sorry if that's confusing, I struggled putting the question into words. </p>
","<p>The fact of the matter is, regardless of the consumption method, a calorie is a calorie. The energy it takes to burn one liquid calorie equals exactly the same as that needed to burn one solid calorie. What throws some people off is the concept of caloric density. Foods that have high water content tend to have lower caloric density (think fruits and veggies), meaning a greater calorie to volume ratio. For example, to consume the same amount of calories you would get from one cup of raisins, you would need to eat nearly ten cups of grapes. What adds to this is that low caloric density foods tend to make you feel fuller faster because of their water content.</p>

<p>This does not mean that simply consuming more liquid will make you want to eat less. Liquid calories may in fact be deceiving because beverages like sodas often contain a lot of calories but do little to satiate hunger. When studies compared food intake between one group given water to drink and the other given soda, there was little difference in the amount of solid calories they ate. However, even though both groups ate roughly the same amount of food, the group who drank the soda consumed more calories overall because of the beverage that accompanied their meal.</p>

"Sutures - do they go through the muscle as well?","182","","<p>A suture is a stitch or row of stitches holding together the edges of a wound or surgical incision.</p>

<p>In the case of deeper cuts, for example, a cut on the back of the thigh, an inch deep and long from knee to heel, does a suture only bring together skin or does it also go through muscle?</p>

"Accelerated tumor growth after stopping prednisolone?","180","","<p>I have a pet rat who was taking prednisolone for allergies. I've read that prednisolone can slow or inhibit tumor growth. When he was taken off of the medication, he grew a grape-sized tumor over the course of one day. I'm sure the timing of him <em>getting</em> a tumor was a coincidence and not caused by the prednisolone or removal thereof, but is it possible that taking him off of the prednisolone caused the tumor to grow at an accelerated rate (i.e. faster than it would have if he was never on the medication in the first place)?</p>
","<p><em>I am not a veterinary so I can't answer your question in particular. Though, maybe following points on the mechanisms of action of prednisolone might perhaps bring some clarifications:</em></p>

<p><em>Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid.</em> The effects of prednisolones are multiple and the antitumor effect of glucocorticoid has been investigated in many studies (most of them were actually conducted in mice or rats). Possible mechanisms of action have been described among which inhibition of glucose transport, phosphorylation, or induction of cell death in immature lymphocytes.</p>

<p>Actually Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine, which is a well know reference book in oncology has an entire chapter on the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of neoplasms. Here an extract of the introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pharmacologic doses of steroid inhibited growth of various tumor
  systems. Tissue culture studies confirmed that <strong>lymphoid cells were the
  most sensitive to glucocorticoids, and responded to treatment with
  decreases in DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein synthesis.</strong>
  Studies of proliferating human leukemic lymphoblasts supported the
  hypothesis that glucocorticoids have preferential lymphocytolytic
  effects. <strong>The mechanism of action was initially thought to be caused by
  impaired energy use via decreased glucose transport and/or
  phosphorylation; it was later discovered that glucocorticoids induce
  apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in certain lymphoid cell
  populations.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here their conclusion, which gives a good summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of action of
  glucocorticoids, <strong>it is clear they are of great clinical value in the
  treatment of lymphoid neoplasms.</strong> They are also sometimes used in
  therapeutic regimens for other <strong>endocrine-responsive cancers</strong>, are
  efficacious in the treatment of several frequently occurring side
  effects of malignancies, and are widely used for general palliative
  therapy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So, yes, prednisolone has an antitumor effect. However, this effect is tumor type dependent and achieved with specific dosing (in humans 10 mg daily to 100 mg/m2/day (depending on indication)). Only a veterinary will be able to provide you with a more accurate and case specific response.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT (after additional clarification was provided by OP)</strong></p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8247014"" rel=""nofollow"">one study</a> which might help in providing some ""time"" reference points in rats. This study looked at rat mammary tumor cells and reported </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After dexamethasone <em>(a type of glucocorticoid)</em> withdrawal, c-myc and cyclin D1 expression (both involved in cell cycle progression)
  transiently peak at <strong>2 and 4 h</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this <strong>could possibly explain the event you have described</strong> although bear in mind these results apply for a <strong>particular tumor type and a particular dosage used.</strong></p>

"Details on molybdenum bioavailability in milk?","179","","<p>There have been reports of molybdenum in milk <a href=""http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(51)91818-8/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">since before 1951</a>. However, supposedly ""<a href=""https://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients/molybdenum"" rel=""nofollow"">there [is] no data on bioavailability in cow's milk</a>"" after all these years.

<p>Perhaps the best way to answer this is to find out in what compounds the molybdenum are in in milk and see if there's any details on those compounds' bio-availability.

","<p><a href=""http://www.diet.com/g/molybdenum"" rel=""nofollow"">Diet.com</a> suggests that molybdenum sources in food are between 57% and 88% efficient in absorption rates nutritionally, and additionally lists milk content as 4.9 μg per cup, which is much lower than the suggestions elsewhere. This may be a good lower bound for calculation. However, remember that the <a href=""http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1136.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">tolerable upper limit for adults is considered to be 0.6 mg of molybdenum</a>, according to the European Food Safety Authority as of 2000.

Each produces a short relief in breathing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normal saline is a sterile mixture of salt and water. It is called
  normal because its salt concentration is similar to tears, blood, and
  other body fluids (0.9% saline). It is also called isotonic solution.
  Normal saline is soothing and will not burn or sting when applied. It
  is used for:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>injecting medicines via the veins (intravenous infusion)</p></li>
  <li><p>rinsing contact lenses</p></li>
  <li><p>rinsing the nasal passages (nasal irrigation)</p></li>
  <li><p>cleansing the bladder (bladder irrigation)</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>How to make normal saline solution at home </p>
  
  <p>Saline solution is easy to make at home. You will need:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>1 clean glass bottle or jar with lid</p></li>
  <li><p>table salt</p></li>
  <li><p>pot with lid</p></li>
  <li><p>Put one cup of water and ½ teaspoon of salt into the pot. Put the lid on.</p></li>
  <li><p>Boil for 15 minutes with the lid on (set a timer).</p></li>
  <li><p>Set the pan aside until cooled to a room temperature.</p></li>
  <li><p>Carefully pour the salt and water (normal saline) from the pan into the jar or bottle and put the lid on.</p></li>

  <p>Normal saline solution: A few important points</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>It is very important to use only fresh normal saline. Bacteria can grow in saline and cause infections</p></li>
  <li><p>Use a clean glass jar or bottle is that has been recently washed in a dishwasher with very hot soapy water</p></li>
  <li><p>Do not drink solution</p></li>
  <li><p>Throw away the solution if it grows cloudy or looks dirty</p></li>
  <li><p>Keep the saline in a bottle or a glass for a maximum of 24 hours. Throw away any unused solution, wash the container, and make a new
  solution.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can buy an over-the-counter nasal spray, if it is a bottle with a screw-on top, empty it out, rinse well with boiled water, and put the saline solution you prepared in that.  Squirt once or twice in each nostril several times a day.  Then just leave the inside of your nose alone and be patient.  If you feel the need to blow your nose, that's okay as long as you do it gently.</p>

<p>During the first few days, find special activities that will distract you from the urge to pick.  Stay away from environments and activities in which you normally engage in picking.</p>

<p>If you don't see improvement within a week, definitely see a doctor.  Or sooner if things are really bothering you.</p>

<p>That's about 37 percent, all added up. They have more information on all these on the website I linked. </p>

<p>I did a bit of looking around myself, just to see. </p>

<p><strong>Male</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://m.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer"" rel=""nofollow"">The main cancer risks for males are:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Prostate, at about 15 percent </li>
<li>Lung, at about 7.5 percent </li>
<li>Colon, at about 5 percent </li>
<li>Bladder, at about 4 percent </li>
<li>Skin, at about 2.5 percent </li>
<li>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at about 2 percent </li>
<li>Kidney, at about 2 percent </li>
</ul>

<p>That adds up to about 38 percent. </p>

<p>Let's see how lifestyle factors impact them. </p>

<p>For <a href=""http://m.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/detailedguide/prostate-cancer-risk-factors"" rel=""nofollow""><em>prostate cancer</em></a>, the four factors you link possibly don't have an impact. Diet might be involved, but we don't really know how:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Men who eat a lot of red meat or high-fat dairy products appear to have a slightly higher chance of getting prostate cancer. These men also tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables. Doctors aren’t sure which of these factors is responsible for raising the risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For <em>lung cancer</em>, smoking is of course the major risk factor. For non-smokers, risk of lung cancer is reduced by about <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170525/"" rel=""nofollow"">85 to 90 percent</a></p>

<p>For <em>colon cancer</em>, about half of the cases <a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer/risk-factors"" rel=""nofollow"">are linked to lifestyle</a>. </p>

<p>For <em>bladder cancer</em>, about half of the cases are <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/bladder-cancer-men-at-risk"" rel=""nofollow"">linked to smoking alone</a>. </p>

<p><em>Skin cancer</em> is caused by sun exposure, but also genetic disposition.</p>

<p>The risk factors for <em>non-hodgkins-lymphoma</em> <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/basics/causes/con-20027792"" rel=""nofollow"">are unknown</a>. </p>

<p>For <em>kidney cancer</em>, risk factors include obesity and smoking, with an estimated <a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/kidney-cancer/risk-factors#heading-Zero"" rel=""nofollow"">40 percent of the risk</a> coming from lifestyle factors. </p>

<p>So, as a back of the envelope calculation, if the risks for prostate and non-hodgkins-lymphoma don't decrease, the lung cancer risk decreases by about 90 percent, and the other listed cancer have a risk decrease of about half, we end up with about 25 percent of the original 38 percent for these 7 cancer types. A reduction of 35 percent. </p>

<p><strong>Female</strong></p>

<p>The main cancers differ for females:</p>

<ul>
<li>Breast, at about 12 percent </li>
<li>Lung, at about 7 percent </li>
<li>Colon, at about 4.5 percent </li>

"What are the best ways to increase fertility?","179","","<p>We are newly married couple. 
What Food habits we need to take care of and what are the best workout tips for us?  If we need to do physical activity - which one is more effective YOGA or Gym Workouts ? and what are the additional precautions I need to take?</p>
","<p><em>I will try to answer your question by using another perspective (risk factors for infertility).</em> </p>

<p><strong>MALE</strong></p>

<p>Among the <strong>main causes of male infertility</strong>, ""idiopathic"" causes (ie not du to endocrine problems, genetic defects or sperm transport problems) represent 40%.</p>

<p>In the last decades, increasing attention has been given to <strong>environmental factors</strong>. Here a brief overview:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>pesticide dibromochloropropane is a well-known cause, as are
lead, cadmium, and mercury</strong>.</li>
<li>The possibility that chemicals with estrogenic or antiandrogenic
activity (“endocrine disruptors”), including insecticides and
fungicides, may lower sperm counts has attracted much attention
lately, although direct proof of an effect in men is lacking.</li>
<li>Occupational and environmental exposure has been associated with
lower quality semen analyses; <strong>limited data suggest that consumption
of fruits and vegetables with high pesticide residues may also be
associated with lower semen quality</strong>.</li>
<li>Because of the rapid increase in cell phone use around the world,
studies have been done to investigate whether cell phone usage has
any detrimental effects on sperm parameters. This issue is
controversial and definitive data are not yet available.</li>
<li><strong>Smoking</strong> – Data on cigarette smoking and its possible effect on sperm
counts are inconsistent. However, in a meta-analysis of 20
observational studies, men who smoked cigarettes were more likely to
have low sperm counts.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperthermia</strong> – Hyperthermia has long been thought to impair
spermatogenesis. Prolonged high testicular temperature may explain
the infertility associated with spinal cord injuries, varicocele, and
chronic sauna and Jacuzzi exposure. <strong>Similarly, febrile illness,
prolonged sitting during work or truck driving, welding, baking,
tight fitting underwear, and laptop use with increased heat to the
testes have been proposed to adversely affect male fertility. The
data to support these associations are inconsistent and may be a very
weak risk factor for infertility</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FEMALE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Similarly to male infertility, idiophatic female infertility has been associated with similar risks factors, although some of them show conflicting results and have still to be confirmed.</strong> Here additional information regarding some risk factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Most series report that <strong>fecundability is decreased if the female partner smokes more than 10 cigarettes per day.</strong> In a 1998 meta-analysis including data from almost 11,000 smoking women and over 19,000 nonsmokers, cigarette smoking by the female partner was associated with a statistically significant increase in infertility compared to nonsmokers (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.34-1.91)</li>
<li><strong>Weight:</strong> most studies report a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 or a BMI less than 17 kg/m2 is associated with increased ovulatory dysfunction and resultant infertility</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding your two specific questions about diet and exercise:</p>

<p><strong>DIET</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In healthy couples, there is no strong evidence that dietary
  variations such as vegetarian diets, low-fat diets, and vitamin or
  antioxidant-enriched diets improve fertility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The intensity and duration of exercise can affect female fertility,
  but the specific type of exercise does not appear to be a factor. In
  some epidemiological studies, vigorous/intense physical activity was
  associated with ovulatory infertility, while others have not
  observed a significant association</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So avoiding some of those proven risk factors, may reduce your risk of developing infertility. I haven't found any evidenced based data of fertility ""stimulants"".</strong></p>

"What is the actual reason behind intestinal gas?","178","","<p>I have some symptoms of <strong>IBS</strong>. And the most irritating problem I'm dealing with is <strong>intestinal gas</strong>. I'm taking medicines but they don't seem working. Neither it is curing IBS nor the gas problem.</p>

<p>I'm taking enough fiber (salad, vegetables, fruits etc.). I don't eat any fast food or something like that. I walk early in the morning, before dinner and light walk after dinner. I do some light <strong>exercises/Yoga</strong>. Yet, I'm suffering from intestinal gas. Bloating is okay but this gas causes pain in my lower part and I've to go to toilet 2-3 times daily to pass the gas only (most of the times). I <strong>can't evacuate</strong> at single time.</p>

<p>So I want to find the root cause of this gas problem and want to find solution for it.</p>

<p>I have three queries to ask in my case:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does constipation cause intestinal gas?</li>
<li>Do some food cause gas and then gas cause constipation?</li>
<li><p>My stools are not like they should be (sometimes liquid, sometimes hard and color varies, and all with gas).</p>

<p>(a) What can be the reason of this? Bad digestion of food or the constipation   (caused by gas?)?
(b) Is it possible that food is digested properly but gas causes the variations and bad stools?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Two</strong> more thing that can help you answer better is that <strong>1st:</strong> <strong>I think a lot</strong> (I don't actually know if it's normal or a lot) about these problems, search many times on internet for solutions. I think like every <strong>half an hour</strong> about these problems. <strong>2nd:</strong> I'm underweight. Everyone calls me skinny. I even think about it many times a day and feel little ashamed and bad. My weight is <strong>57</strong> Kg and I'm <strong>aged 24</strong>.</p>

<p>Is this thinking is causing all problems and even IBS?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I take sufficient sleep. <strong>7-8</strong> hours per day. There are no sleeping disorders.</p>

<p>I hope you understand my problem and you can answer it. I shall be thankful to you.</p>
","<p>The actual mechanism of intestinal gas is that ""normal intestinal bacteria"" in the large intestine produce it. If you consume certain nutrients, these bacteria will consume them and produce gas. Everyone has these bacteria, so this is not a problem, the problem can be nutrients by which you ""feed them"":</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Soluble fiber</strong> in foods, such as barley, oats, legumes (beans, peas, lentils) and some fruits. Check for more detailed <a href=""http://www.nutrientsreview.com/carbs/dietary-fiber-soluble-insoluble.html"" rel=""nofollow"">list of foods high in soluble fiber</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lactose,</strong> mainly in milk, but also in ice cream or yogurt (not in cheese or butter). People with lactose intolerance cannot digest lactose, so this travels from the small to large intestine, where bacteria degrade it and produce gas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fructose</strong> in certain fruits (apples, pears, mango, agave), honey and beverages sweetened with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) can cause bloating and lose stools in individuals with fructose malabsorption.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To reduce all 3 nutrients at once you may consider a <a href=""http://www.med.monash.edu/cecs/gastro/fodmap/low-high.html"" rel=""nofollow"">low-FODMAP diet</a>.</p>

<p>Constipation may worsen bloating because intestinal bacteria have more time to degrade substances in your stool. Constipation can be prevented by being physically active (walking), drinking enough water (not ""a lot,"" just enough) and avoiding certain foods. People with IBS commonly report that sugary foods, carbonated, caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, cheese and chocolate...and certain other foods...irritate them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Few more causes of irregular bowel movements and bloating:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Intestinal parasites, including worms and unicellular parasites, like Giardia (stool tests are available)</p></li>
<li><p>Celiac disease - an intolerance to gluten, which is in wheat, rye and barley.</p></li>
<li><p>Chronic infection of stomach by the bacterium H. pylori can cause bloating in the upper abdomen--this is stomach bloating--a typical symptom that can differ it from intestinal bloating is frequent burping (belching). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Two common causes of constipation are dehydration and anxiety.</p>

<p>Excessive worrying may worsen IBS and is probably one of the causes of IBS. But thinking how to solve stomach problems is just OK.</p>

"Can a person die of hunger while still being severely obese?","177","","<p>A severely overweight American is imprisoned in some country XYZ after accusations of spying.

<p>The questions I wanted to ask are what would happen if this scenario continued for some extended time.</p>

"Normal resting heart rate and how to measure it","177","","<p>There is somewhat conflicting information on what the ""normal"" resting heart rate should be. Some sites cite rates <strong>between 60 and 100</strong> as being normal, with rates below 60 being defined as <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bradycardia/basics/definition/con-20028373"" rel=""nofollow"">bradycardia</a>, i.e. a ""condition"". However, most sites also mention that it's normal for athletic people to have heart rates as low as 40, and that people should try to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/features/5-heart-rate-myths-debunked"" rel=""nofollow"">keep it below 70</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> A normal heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute?</p>
  
  <p>That's the old standard. Many doctors think it should be lower. About <strong>50-70 beats per minute</strong> is ideal, says Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, director of women's heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital.</p>
  
  <p>Recent studies suggest a heart rate <strong>higher than 76 beats per minute</strong> when you're resting may be linked to a higher risk of heart attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is rather conflicting, since 76 is at around 40% of the 60-100 range, implying it even gravitates to the ""fitter"" range? Is the <strong>""new standard""</strong> correct?</p>

<p>Furthermore, regarding RHR calculation, my fitness tracker calculates the RHR as the first heart rate after waking up, while still lying in bed (it tends to be slightly below 60 on average). But this is really my lowest rate during the day (sleeping excluded), and while sitting at my desk during the day (I am a programmer), it will stick around 70 bpm - I am obviously not as fit as I would want to be. Is the <strong>in-bed resting heart rate</strong> really the ""correct"" indicator of fitness?</p>
","<p>First thing in the morning before getting up is usually considered the gold standard for RHR and will produce your lowest reading during waking hours. That said, when you are at the doctor's office and they take your HR you'll likely read a bit higher, much like you would sitting at your desk.</p>

<p>Traditional ideal RHR ranges i.e. ones that tend higher assume the reading at your desk/doctor's office. The ""new standard"" takes into account people who use their Fitbit/smartphone app/whatnot wizmo gadget first thing in the morning before hopping out of bed and thus suggests a lower ideal.</p>

<p>I would not consider an RHR in the low to mid 40's a condition in highly trained individuals; even following entry level endurance training regiments non-smoking, healthy-eating types can easily dip into the low 50's, in my experience.</p>

<p>A RHR at or close to 100 definitely approaches risky territory for the average person but other risk factors (smoking, obesity, etc.) would likely present before RHR approaches those levels. When present in combination with these activities, therefore, such a high RHR would be considered ""normal"" but your doctor would tell you to quit smoking, eat healthier, and get more exercise rather than to bring your RHR down.</p>

To my knowledge they all had somewhat similar results:<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seven solitary subjects, and two groups of four, spent from 5 to 13
  days in an isolation unit without knowledge of time. Three solitary
  subjects and one group of four adopted fairly regular activity habits
  with a period of 25-27 h; one subject adopted a period of 30 h, and
  one of 27 h initially, decreasing to 24-25 h after a few days. One
  group of four awoke roughly every 24 h, after a sleep which was
  alternately about 8 h, or about 4 h and believed by the subjects to be
  an afternoon siesta. Two solitary subjects alternated sleeps of about
  8 or 16 h, separated by 24 h of activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while your 'optimal' rhythm might be somewhere around 25 hours of activity in one circadian cycle, there are severe social implications to consider living in 'another timezone' than everybody else in your community.<br><br>
Concerning the second part of your question <em>and then sleep for over 16 hours</em>, there are studies, which show that for an average adult the optimal amout of sleep lies between 7-9 hours. However, the test subjects in these studies are usually just awake for around 15 hours. So, I do not think that anybody can give you a responsible advice on this matter.</p>

<p>Also, to my knowledge, there is no reasonable amount of evidence for long-term effects such a changed circadian cycle might have on one's health.</p>

<p>Longer answer: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25754279"">UVB rays are essential for Vitamin D synthesis</a>.

"Skin receptors on finger tip","175","","<p>How many receptors do we have on our fingertipps per square centimeters? I found 2500 but do not find the source.
Is this correct?</p>
","<p>I'll assume you're only asking about mechanoreceptors, else it gets too murky. </p>

<p>Humans have four types of mechanoreceptors. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Meissner corpuscle, innervated by RA1 (rapidly adapting type 1) nerve fibers. There are 2 of the fibers per square millimeter in the monkey finger (my source does not list it for humans), with 10 to 20 Meissner corpuscles per axon, so 1000 to 2000 per square centimeter. </p></li>
<li><p>Merkel cell, at the end of SA1 (slowly adapting type 1) nerve fibres. I did not find a source for the adult human, but Kandell says that RA1 fibres are the ""most numerous"". So 2000 would be the upper limit for Merkel cells too. But here it gets complicated, because the actual mechanoreceptor is not a single Merkel cell, but a cluster of them. </p></li>
<li><p>and 4., Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings (corresponding to RA2 and SA2 fibres) are much rarer. The whole hand has 2400 Pacinian corpuscles in the young and 300 in the elderly. Both of them only have one receptor per nerve fibre. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Given this information, 2500 is certainly in the right ballpark. I would trust that number. </p>

<p>Note that this doesn't mean that you can sense 2500 separate locations of pressure in a square centimeter of fingertip. The different mechanoreceptors sense different types and frequency of pressure, and the sensory fields overlap even within a single type of receptor. </p>

"What needs to be exposed for the body to produce Vitamin D?","173","","<p>What parts of the body need to be exposed to sunlight for the body to produce Vitamin D?</p>

<p>Some say it's the skin, some say it's the eyes, and some say it's a combination.</p>

<p>The most common answer I have received from doctors is that ""it's just the skin, not the eyes"" (although I have heard all three from them).  But I remember seeing a television show that talked about dramatic increase in disease of indigenous people living near the Amazon river when they started wearing sunglasses provided introduced by non-natives.  The investigators came to the conclusion that the disease was most likely caused by the introduction of the sunglasses because they were preventing the production of Vitamin D.</p>

<p>Naturally, I take anything I hear, see, or read with a grain of salt (especially from the boob tube), but that TV show made an impression, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Is there any truth to it?</p>

<p>Although good for the eyes, does wearing sunglasses reduce the amount of Vitamin D we produce?</p>
","<p>Vitamin D is produced in the skin, not the eyes.<a href=""http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">(1)</a></p>

<p>I would imagine that when those indigenous peoples were introduced to sunglasses, they were also introduced to a number of other items they had never previously known, such as tobacco, alcohol and fast food. Diseases they had no immunity to might also have played a role. </p>

<p>The synthesis of vitamin D is well understood and sources describing it can be found in many places so I'm not going to quote the entire process, but a good explanation can be found <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/6/1678S.full"">here under the heading ""PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF VITAMIN D""</a>. In short, it's a passive process that occurs in the skin and is not regulated by the brain, eyes, or other organs. What determines the amount of vitamin D synthesized by the body? Solely the amount of UVB photons penetrating the skin and the person's age:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anything that either influences the number of solar UVB photons that penetrate the skin or alters the amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin influences the cutaneous production of vitamin D3. The amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the epidermis is relatively constant until later in life, when it begins to decline (17, 18). <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/6/1678S.full"">Ibid., ""FACTORS THAT ALTER THE CUTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF VITAMIN D3""</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no other factors mentioned in synthesis, and as you can see from the diagram <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/6/1678S/F3.large.jpg"">here</a> there is no involvement of the eyes or brain in vitamin D physiology at any point. Could there be an indirect involvement of the brain since it also controls the parathyroid glands? Yes, there could, but that wouldn't change the results of how we measure vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Therefore, an assertion that the eyes are involved in vitamin D deficiencies is purely speculative and the burden of providing evidence for it would be on the person making the assertion. I can find no evidence to support the notion. It's also a little odd considering that a huge number of people living in developed countries have been wearing sunglasses for many decades without ill effect. Why would we have not seen this effect long ago? Is it possible these indigenous peoples have unique genetic differences that altered their basic mammalian vitamin D physiology and somehow caused their eyes to be involved? Well, anything's possible, but that would be an <em>astonishing</em> finding and it also is purely speculative.</p>

"Anxiety of everything","172","","<p>My wife has been worrying about cancer in the past from time to time. Five years ago, she told me there was a hard spot around her neck, and started worrying about all kinds of sickness she could search from Google. We spent lots of time and money, and it turns out nothing there. Since then, she doubted many times on some parts of body and always related them to cancer, which were later proved nothing again and again. Lately, she is worrying about her back, rub it frequently, so that her skin on back was peeled off. First time, doctor told her there was nothing. Second time, she went to a different doctor and he gave her some antibio medicine for slight infection. No matter what doctor or I say to comfort her, she always thinks people are ignoring her serious concern. But I am pretty sure she is alright but may not be mentally. How can I help her? </p>
","<p>She has something called hypochondria which is the same disease I suffer from. Hypochondria means excessive health anxiety. Let me tell you some key points. If she is worried too much she'll start producing <strong>REAL SYMPTOMS</strong> in her body. I was worried about a spot in my mouth for 2 years and had misdiagnosed it as leukoplakia using google. As a result I developed chronic neck pain. Never let her do that. Google often provides links to websites with <strong>INCOMPLETE</strong> information about a disease intended for the general public and NOT proper medical websites. A lump in the throat is actually normal as lymph nodes are present there. If it was cancer indeed, 5 years would have been ample time for the tumor to grow in size and cause fever and all other cancer symptoms. Health anxiety is not something you can completely get rid off. It's only a moment of time before you discover some new virus over the internet that spreads through touching/sneezing and start obsessing about it. You need to tell her to relax and make her believe that the human body is more complex and well suited to fight infection and diseases than she knows. Just google the placebo (also nocebo) effect and tell her read about it. It proves how powerful can human psychology be when it comes to physical well-being. To a hypochondriac repeated reassurance is required because they tend to fall into a cycle of constant worrying and re-analysing the cause of their worry. The key to overcome this is to break this cycle. Practicing meditation on a daily basis helps calm the mind and allows it to think more clearly. Also meditation helps you to analyse yourself in a quieter way. That way you learn to control your anxieties. I will strongly recommend <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelSealey"" rel=""nofollow"">Michael Sealey's YouTube channel</a> for video-guides to meditation and hypnosis. Begin with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iUvfyCY"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>. These definitely helped me more than anti-anxiety medication ever did. </p>

"Why does the weight matter when consuming a certain amount of a specific drug?","171","","<p>My question is actually referred to hallucinogenic substances, in particular to mushrooms.</p>

<p>I can understand why alcohol or other substances that relate to body mass (fat in some cases) affect people to a greater or a lesser extent depending on their weight (for a given amount of a certain drug).</p>

<p>What I do not understand (perhaps this is not even true) is why the more mass a person has, more grams of mushrooms that person has to take in order to get the same psychoactive effect. </p>

<p>If the active substance finally goes to the brain, where is the weight's role in this process?</p>

<p>People with experience in this recommends intakes of a certain amount of grams depending on one's weight. Does this have a logical reason?</p>
","<p>I think the centre of confusion for you is this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the active substance finally goes to the brain, where is the weight's role in this process?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, when a substance has a systemic effect (as opposed to local) it somehow has to get from the point where it is applied to the site of action. So, if one ingests something that affects the brain, it has to travel from the stomach to the head somehow - and substances do this via blood. So <strong>the substance is liberated from the form in which one took it, then dissolved and absorbed into the bloodstream.</strong> Since blood reaches all parts of the body, so does the substance. We usually see most of its effects on one body part/organ, but it gets distributed (more or less) everywhere.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What does this have to do with body mass?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To answer this, we must look into the process in which a substance passes from the blood stream to a tissue. This can be done by several mechanisms such as: diffusion, active transport, pinocitosis etc. For many <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic"" rel=""noreferrer"">xenobiotics</a> (substances foreign to our body) the route of transport is diffusion through cellular membranes. <strong>The rate and the extent of diffusion are proportional to concentration gradient.</strong><br>
This means two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The higher the difference in the <strong>concentrations</strong> between the blood and the other tissue, the higher the rate and extent of diffusion will be.</li>
<li>This process doesn't depend solely on the total amount of the substance taken; it depends on concentration.</li>
</ul>

<p>And since: <strong>c = amount/V</strong></p>

<p>we can see that, if we dissolve the same amount of a substance if different volumes (of blood e.g.) we will get different concentrations. Which brings us to the fact that <strong>blood volume is important</strong>. Among other factors, <strong>blood volume depends on body mass</strong>. The mass of the blood amounts for roughly 7% of our body mass, and the volume is proportional to that.*</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Bigger body mass => higher blood volume => lesser substance concentration => lesser the rate and the extent of diffusion into the target organ (such as the brain)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>When the substance gets into a tissue, depending on its chemical structure it can: find a target protein and have an effect (note that this doesn't have to be the ""desired"" effect); it can dissolve in fat tissue; it can bind to proteins or other structures such as bones. Again the strength of these bonds depends on the chemical structure of the substance (among other factors) - it can bind reversibly and soon be on its way again or it can get deposed in a tissue it has chemical affinity for. We say that the substance is distributed to various compartments**. If the size of these compartments is bigger, than there is more ""room"" for the substance to be distributed, and potentially ""stored"", so to speak.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><em>Bigger body mass => (usually proportionally) bigger mas of many tissues => bigger volume to distribute the substance and potentially bigger deposing capacity.</em> 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VsCm9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>
</ol>

<p>Source: ref. 4</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The catch</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Things get complicated because many substances in our blood bind to plasma proteins (usually albumin) and the bound fraction is in equilibrium with the unbound (free fraction). It is only the free fraction of the substance that can diffuse through cell membranes (protein-substance complex is too large). Various substances have different binding potential, and they compete with each other for the same binding sites, and affect each other's kinetics. What's more, Liberation, Absorption and Distribution are followed by Metabolism and Excretion (the so called LADMER system). All these processes happen simultaneously after a (usually short) lag time. </p>

<p>This means that <strong>the concentration of a substance in blood depends on many factors</strong>. We calculate most of these factors in, based on information we get from testing on animals and from clinical trials, and use mathematical models and computer simulations to determine the dose and dosage which would achieve and maintain the concentration of a substance in blood in a certain range, and assume that this will have a predicted effect. <strong>All these calculations are approximations. Although body mass is an important factor in them, calculating a dose of a substance based only on total body mass is a very rough approximation.</strong></p>

<p>Another catch for controlled substances: there is significantly less data on the kinetics of these substances than on medicines (which are intended to cure or manage a disease). So the ""calculations"" are limited. On the other hand when these substances reach other parts of the body, and are metabolised, aside from their psychoactive effects they can affect other organs as well, causing liver or kidney failure, for instance.</p>

<hr>

<p>*Gender, body structure (especially lean body mass), age and other factors determine the exact mass and volume of the blood; still total body mass is strongly correlated with the amount of blood in the body.</p>

<p>** The division into compartments is theoretical, designed to make the calculations easier. It is based on the fact that the concentrations of a substance change differently in different compartments. In reality, all ""compartments"" are connected, and interact with each other at all times. </p>

<p>*** This explanation is simplified for general public. The equation above is for concentration in general. Blood concentration of a substance is never equal to simple quotient of the quantity and volume (remember to take point 2 and the catch into account). The theoretical term <em>volume of distribution</em> or <em>apparent volume of distribution</em> is not equal to blood volume - it is calculated by considering various factors. </p>

<p>If that doesn't seem like an answer to you, I'll put it in plain English, but first an aside.</p>

<p>The Romans (well, <em>maybe</em> limited to the middle class and up), who had soap to wash garments with, did not use soap on their skin. Instead, they bathed in hot water, then were coated with an infused olive oil (say, lavender), then the oil was scraped from their skin with a scraper, taking away the old and (?)foul smelling, and leaving behind some of the nicer, new stuff. A couple of additional steps and they were clean. That was good skin care.</p>

<p>No one today washes that way. It would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. By habit, many people would not feel clean, either, because they equate ""bubbles"" with ""clean"".</p>

<p>Your Cetaphil is trying to do that - replace oil removed with oil deposited - while still foaming and acting as a wash, which people expect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it because, in general, it still remove your skin oil? Therefore, after all I still need to apply moisturizer. In that case, what is the different to use normal soap and then use moisturizer after that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, soap and detergent are different things. I'll assume you mean soap.</p>

<p>A very high quality soap (which you can't buy commercially) will attempt to do the same thing by <em>superfatting</em> the soap using oils with a great skin care profile: Jojoba oil, Macademia Nut oil, Shea butter, Cocoa butter, etc. to the point of almost not foaming (no bubbles). You would find the Cetaphil and the soap would leave you feeling about the same.</p>

<p>Regualar soap strips the skin of all fats and sweat, dirt, etc. Then you replace the oils stripped with new oils and the other ingredients in your moisturizer.</p>

<p>Does it matter? You can answer that yourself. In one scenario, you strip your skin of oils then add them back. In another, you have some good oils on your skin and you add to that. Which sounds healthier for your skin?</p>

<p><sub>If you wonder why I am so opinionated on the matter, it's because I used to make skin care products for health care professionals, who often developed nasty hand dermatitis from hospital supplied skin cleansers. When my husband developed a rash that wouldn't go away - winter or summer, on vacation, using other soaps, etc., - and under a dermatologist's care for two years, biopsied twice and using steroids and other topical meds, I decided I could do better. I learned everything I could about skin health, and made some wonderful soaps and lotions that cured my husband's and others' dermatological problems. I studied skin care for about six years, and made products for five, always improving my formulas. In that very narrow area, I'd pit my knowledge against any but the best dermatologist's. In every country I've visited, their most expensive soaps are no where close to mine. They might be quadruple-milled, but they still are basically oil-stripping soaps.</sub></p>

","<p>Precisely because developed countries have better air quality, nutrition, sanitation, healthcare, etc. life expectancy is higher and cancer is more likely in these countries. 
This is because cancer is caused by mutations in DNA which accumulate over time. 
Since life expectancy in general is higher in developed countries, there is more time for mutations to accumulate and for cancer to develop in these people. 
Less developed countries have lower life expectancy, which means diseases and issues which developed countries have solved or are able to successfully deal with kill large enough portions of populations in undeveloped countries before mutations in DNA can accumulate in these people.
For this reason, cancer is often referred to as the problem -- in large part -- of the developed world. </p>

","<p>Collagen is not an easy-to-digest protein and generally requires collagenase for efficient digestion. Without digestion, it cannot be absorbed. Moreover, collagen has to be deposited in the right site.</p>

<p>So irrespective of whether collagen is completely digested or not, it cannot be specifically useful for replacing the lost collagen in the joints. </p>

<p>There are two modified amino acids in collagen- hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, which are essential for the structural integrity of the protein. Vitamin-C is involved in natural production of these amino acids in the body from the unmodified amino acids and hence the deficiency of Vit-C results in scurvy. </p>

<p>Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, given as supplements may have some positive effects in healing of injuries <sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15338346"" rel=""nofollow"">[ref]</a></sup> (I am not too sure about this). In general, a good diet would be sufficient and talking collagen as a supplement is, IMO, <strong>not useful</strong>.</p>

"Should i start drinking coffee or tea for health reasons?","167","","<p>I'm in my mid thirties.  For all my life, the only beverage I liked was water.  I always disliked drinking anything that had flavor like juice, hit chocolate, soda etc... I disliked coffee and teas even more because they are bitter. Alcohol is even more foul and unusual than everything else.  Water is the best because it has no flavor and I can gulp it down quickly.</p>

<p>Recently, some of my employees ( computer programmers) suggested I start learning how to drink coffee for health reasons.  I looked on website and there seems to be just as many opinions on how coffee is good and bad for you.</p>

<p>I would say that I am quite healthy.  I usually eat home cooked meals and avoid eating out.  I am always energetic and only feel tired at the end of twelve hour work days.  I snap out of bed every day and rush to computer to start work before I even brush teeth or daily grooming ( my life is pretty fast paced because I run my own software company).  I am quite athletics from thirty years of martial arts training and boxing and I routinely train with and fight professional fighters , so my conditioning is pretty good.</p>

<p>Will I see long-term improved health benefits, long-term improved work performance and long term improved athletic performance if I force myself to routinely drink coffee or tea?</p>
","<p>I am not an expert, but I am going to write up what I think. Note that there is a <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"">Coffee Stack Exchange</a> if you later have non-health related questions about coffee.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-10-2013/coffee-for-health.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Caffeine has some positive effects, but also some negative effects</a>.</p>

<p>The positive effects seem to be linked to better mood and concentration, and preventing a number of cancers and Type II diabetes. It also improves athletic performance a tiny bit, especially when working out in the morning.</p>

<p>Ironically, the same article mentions that caffeine may decrease people's mood by making them anxious and disrupting sleep patterns if you take it too late in the day. It raises blood pressure levels make it harder for people with Type II diabetes to manage their insulin levels. Coffee is also a mutagenic.</p>

<p>So whatever health positives there are, there seems to be a risk for the opposite to occur, which is a bit paradoxical. Coffee contains antioxidants, but it's also a laxative which may inhibit uptake of nutrients. It may upset your stomach. It may stain your teeth over time. There are also some other effects (good and bad) you can read about.</p>

<p>There is also the finding in rat subjects that <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5897375/coffee-makes-over-achievers-slack-off"" rel=""nofollow"">coffee only makes the ""lazy"" motivated, but already motivated subjects are actually hampered by the stimulant</a>.</p>

<p>The health benefits your friends are referring to, I think are dubious. If you don't even enjoy coffee, I think the net effect may even be negative for you. There is usually a peer pressure around drinking coffee (because it is a stimulant drug), and maybe they just want you to join in.</p>

<p>I am a coffee drinker, and the main reason I drink it is because it gets me alert in the morning (and I have learned to enjoy the taste, which is a positive). I also use it as a short-term mood booster to get back to work, if my morale starts to wind down. But on the negative side is that it can make you jittery and anxious, and the motivation gained is followed by a ""crash"" where your concentration and mood will slip. </p>

<p>Coffee does not provide concentration over an extended time, so any cognitive performance increase will be short-lived. Basically, caffeine will only help you work longer <em>if you are already tired</em>, but it will <em>not</em> improve cognitive performance if you are already energized. Think of it as a 2 am quick fix, not an 11 am booster. It will however probably improve physical performance a bit whenever.</p>

<p>From your description of yourself, I would <em>not</em> start. You do not seem to need it, in any practical way.</p>

<p>Regarding tea, it usually contains some caffeine (there are caffeine-free teas), but it may also provide more antioxidants. It may be a better health choice than coffee.</p>

","<p>Ps:myopia is condition your cousin is having most likely.</p>

<p>children's bodies grow, so do the eyes, which may cause a gradual increase in myopia. And just as bodily growth can be in uneven spurts, the changes in myopia may be similarly uneven. During adolescence, the change can be rather rapid and require a new, thicker eyeglass correction more than once a year, but when body growth slows or stops (usually by age 18), the myopia tends to stabilize. There is normally no reason to worry about the frequent changes in lens correction that occur during adolescence. Almost never is there any real danger to eyesight, and vision can almost always be corrected to 20/20 or better with eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>

<p>Note: There is an extremely rare type of myopia, called malignant progressive myopia, which is a serious condition and leads to gradual structural damage to the eye. This type needs regular clinical evaluation. It is not related to ordinary myopia and does not develop from ordinary myopia.</p>

<li>For your cousin, it may be the correct time for his eyeball to stop growing . Ask him to do check up regularly. </li>

"What is the time frame of developing adrenal suppression when taking oral corticosteroids?","165","","<p>I was prescribed a short-term prednisolone therapy. From my research, it seems that many of the side effects are associated with prednisolone replacing the natural corticosteroids produced by the body, and changes to the adrenal-pituitary axis. But I couldn't find a source which explains how long it takes until the glands cease producing hormones. </p>

<p>I am of course interested in a yes/no answer for my specific case (a total of 500 mg prednisolone over 7 days, starting at 100 mg and tapering after day 3) but also would like to learn more about the time dimension of the side effects of corticosteroids. </p>
","<p>This question arises from your (correct) understanding that administration of exogenous (i.e. not produced by the body) glucocorticoids (GCs) can suppress the body’s ability to produce its own GCs in the adrenal glands. In order to understand the answer, a little background is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the body become unable to produce cortisone?</strong><br>
As in many endocrine systems, negative feedback maintains homeostasis. Exogenous GCs exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a series of hormones starting in the hypothalamus) that normally stimulates GC production in the adrenals. This negative feedback is almost immediately reversible. However, with extended administration of exogenous GCs, the lack of stimulation via the HPA axis leads to atrophy of the adrenal gland, and it becomes unable to produce the horomone <em>even when the feedback suppression is removed</em>. Your question is, <strong>how much exogenous GC is required to produce this effect?</strong></p>

<p>It’s a very practical question because it affects how doctors prescribe steroids. <em>If</em> adrenal suppression is expected, they must be tapered slowly. <em>If not</em>, a “burst” can be administered and then immediately stopped. Because it’s such a practical question, people thought to study it quite a while ago, and the relevant literature is mostly pretty old (relative to most biomedical data, at least). (See below.)</p>

<p>The time required to achieve suppression depends upon:  </p>

<ul>
<li>the dose; </li>
<li>the length of time administered; and  </li>
<li>factors unique to each patient, probably resulting from (ultimately genetic) differences in their rates of GC metabolism.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who is likely to be suppressed: some general guidelines</strong></p>

<p><strong>Not suppressed</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>GC treatment (any dose) for less than three weeks.   </li>
<li>Treatment with less than 10 mg total daily dose (prednisone equivalents) for any time period.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Suppressed</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Oral GC treatment of >20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >3 weeks  </li>
<li>Any patient with clinical Cushing’s syndrome (see <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/307/165"">this answer</a> for description)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Uncertain suppression</strong>: The degree of suppression in this intermediate group is related to individual metabolism parameters that are not (yet!) established in a way that can be measured and used clinically.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Less than 20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >3 weeks.</li>
<li>Any dose for >3 weeks administered every other day.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rule of thumb I learned (which is fairly conservative): >10 mg for >3 weeks requires tapering.  </p>

<p>In those patients who fall into the uncertain category, there is something called a ""cosyntropin stimulation test” that helps make the distinction. In this test, a doctor administers a hormone (cosyntropin, a.k.a. ACTH) that stimulates the adrenal gland and measures plasma cortisol concentrations to see if it responds appropriately.</p>

<p>I’ve been talking in prednisone “equivalents.” There are <a href=""http://www.medcalc.com/steroid.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">steroid equivalent converters</a> around. In general, prednisolone and prednisone have a 1:1 dosing relationship. </p>

<p>The answer to your question, then, is <strong>no</strong>. Seven days is a common prescription for a steroid “burst”, and tapering is generally considered to be unnecessary. </p>

"What is the ideal amount of salt intake (daily)?","164","","<p>What amount of daily salt intake is ideal for a person? Does increased consumption cause any adverse effects on the health of the person?</p>
","<p>The recommended daily intake of salt varies, but Nutrition Australia recommends 1.15-2.00 grams per day.  </p>

<p>When you consume more salt than this, your blood pressure increases as a result of the body's compensatory mechanism for controlling the increase in plasma sodium.  The body prefers to have higher blood pressure than to have a higher sodium concentration, as a high sodium concentration can be catastrophic and can lead to seizures and coma.</p>

<p>The mechanism behind the increase in blood pressure in order to control sodium concentration is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The increase in plasma osmolarity due to the increased plasma sodium causes the osmoreceptor cells located in the anterior hypothalamus near the supra-optic nuclei to shrink.  This shrinkage of the osmoreceptor cells causes them to fire, sending nerve signals to nerve cells in the supra-optic nuclei, which eventually transmit signals to the posterior pituitary.</p></li>
<li><p>This results in increased release of the hormone ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) from the posterior pituitary.  This ADH hormone then enters the blood stream, moves to the kidneys and increases the permeability of the collecting tubules to water, resulting in increased water resorption in the kidneys, leading to urine being more concentrated.</p></li>
<li><p>The net result is an increase in water resorption and an increase in blood volume and blood pressure.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>High blood pressure is associated with many adverse health effects, particularly cardiovascular disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.</p>

","<p>After researching alot into EMR shielding, it seems the answer is twofold; for very low frequency Iron or Steel works fine,for higher end of low frequency Mu-Metal or Nickel filaments/sheets, or Graphite and even carbon will do. I did not find their maximum Ghz,but from the first study linked in the original question, ferromagnetics could reach probably a few ghz and maybe more,but with strong magnetic field they would be useless.</p>

<p>Although Ferromagnetic work they are limited to low frequencies, if the frequency is high enough it will just pass the shield,it will also conduct the waves making the problem worse.  And I've been told(did not confirm yet) that they could not shield magnetic near fields.</p>

<p>The thing that really repulse the magnetic field are Superconductors that work via Meissner effect. So far the best I've found are Graphene Superconductor( can be homemade from graphite),and also Graphite or Pyrolytic Carbon can work,there does not seem to be an other material. This covers the magnetic shielding, but probably needs to shield the electric aspect of the wave aswell, so a dielectric compound must be added to the shield or perhaps just electricity absorber with a insulator material.</p>

<p>And for carbon materials, either plain or modified Graphite/Graphene could be better than anything else,considering a Graphene Superconductor would provide both natural shielding effect coupled with the Meissner effect.</p>

","<p>You should attempt to lower the surrounding <strong>temperature</strong> and <strong>restrict the amount of light</strong> entering the room you're sleeping in. Eye masks are a cost-effective solution to reducing excessive light from entering your eyes.</p>

Remember to take proper care of your body -and mind- as this will result in better overall health. <strong>Eating ""properly""</strong> (enough energy, nutrients and hydration, all in proper quantities) before bed will also improve your quality of sleep. Feeling bloated is a great way to stay awake for unnecessarily long periods of time.</p>

<p><strong>Regular exercise is rewarding</strong>. Going to bed and falling asleep might be easier if you've exerted your body and have a tangible feeling of accomplishment. This is your body telling you to get rest, because it needs to repair the tissue damage and rebuild your body after a workout. As to how much and when you should exercise, I cannot answer. That is something that varies greatly from person to person. Personally I've found that early morning runs pre 06:00 (AM) are a great way to start off a day with full of energy.</p>

<p>Yes, it's possible in that he may not <em>believe he's qualified</em> to prescribe HRT for a transitioning female. Treating transitioning females hormonally is not a common occurrence, and doctors are allowed to refuse to treat conditions they're unfamiliar or (medically) uncomfortable with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transsexual patients often have difficulty finding care because many physicians are not comfortable prescribing appropriate hormone regimens. Management of hormones for transsexual patients is not difficult, and these medications are safer than many therapies routinely prescribed by the primary care physician. <em>The diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) must be established by an experienced mental health professional prior to consideration for hormonal management.</em></p>

<p>Once this has been done, a specialist can easily communicate the treatment regimen to be followed, but it's really up to the individual physician to do so. Most will. Some won't. In that case, a reasonable physician will refer to a colleague who does do so.</p>

","<p>In general, it is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"">basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the organism</a> which in a person who doesn't exercise more than average, consumes <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/5/941.full"">most of the calories of the daily intake</a>. It is dependent of age, sex, population and fat-free mass, i.e. the mass of muscles in your body, which consume a lot of energy just for maintenance. Studies show that it can vary individually <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280423"">between 1000 and 2500 kcal/day</a> within just one population. Many factors and energy consumers contribute to the basal metabolic rate, but approximately 70% of it <a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/contents/3079f916-ceb8-591d-90da-02738d5b0739/M2845E00.HTM"">is used for maintenance of the body's main organs</a>, and the rest is used for physical activity (in an average human) and for thermogenesis and digesting your food.</p>

<p>It is not known why exactly the BMR decreases with age. While it can be partly attributed to lifestyle changes after early adulthood with decrease in exercise and physical activity, studies show that it is <a href=""http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/259/2/E233.short"">not the only contributing factor</a>. Part of it may be attributed to ""an alteration in tissue energy"". But when you compare age 40 with age 20, another part is that human adolescence and body growth are active until approximately <a href=""http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/227.1.long"">age 17.5 in women and age 19 in men</a>, which <a href=""http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/30408.pdf"">also heavily contributes to BMR</a>.</p>

","<p><em>Just as a small background before answering your question</em>: as suggested in the previous answers, <strong>the menstrual cycle is regulated by complex interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis and the uterus.</strong> The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (<strong>GnRH</strong>), which stimulates the release of follicle stimulating hormone (<strong>FSH</strong>) and luteinizing hormone (<strong>LH</strong>) from the pituitary gland. These so called gonadotropins (LH and FSH) stimulate the ovary to release an oocyte that is capable of fertilisation if it encounters a spermatozoid. In the same time, hormones are secreted by the ovary in response to FSH or LH. These hormones influence the endometrium (= the inner layer of the uterus)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OtIb0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OtIb0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>the follicular or proliferative phase (D4-D14 of the cycle)</em></strong>: it is
characterised by the recruitment of a cohort of follicles and the
ultimate selection of a “dominant” preovulatory follicle.
Additionally, this phase shows increasing levels of estradiol which
stimulate the proliferation of endometrium. This proliferation takes
time (approx 10 days) as cells composing the endometrium replicate
intensively (mitosis) in order to enhance the thickness of the
endometrium (remember, the endometrium has to be “prepared” for a
possible implantation of a blastocyts (= first stage of an
embryon)). The figure below shows the change in the structure of the endometrium.</li>
<li><p><strong><em>the luteal or secretory phase (D14-D28):</em></strong> the production of
progesterone leads to a differentiation of the endomterium which
reaches its full maturity. Here again, time is needed, to gain the
level of complexity found in the endometrium of the luteal phase: the
glands and the arteries in the endometrium begins to entwine, the
connective tissue show oedematous changes. Everything is prepared to help the blastocyst to develop in the case of an implantation</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>the menstruation phase (D1-D4):</em></strong> when implantation does not occur, the
amounts of estradiol and progesterone drop significantly, leading to
a constriction of the arteries found in the endometrium. This results
to the expulsion of the so called “functional layer” of the
endometrium.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does my body gauge that amount of time? Is there some kind of
  external factor (wake/sleep cycles, etc) or is there some kind of
  internal timer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore <strong>the duration of the menstrual cycle is defined by the time needed for all these changes to occur</strong>: the proliferation of cells of the endometrium, the development of arteries and the differentiation of glands in the endometrium etc… Similar example would be the time needed for wound healing for example (where the proliferative phase is characterised by fibroblast migration, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, migration of new cells) or lung tissue recovery after a pneumonia.</p>

<p>Why the duration of cycle is different from one woman to another is dependent, as you have already suggested, on internal factors (the concentration of hormones, the presence of a concomitant chronic disease for example) and external factors (stress, drugs,…)</p>

<p>The body gauges the amount of time necessary for the cycle, ie the time necessary for all the endometrial changes to occur (in a woman:  approx 28-32 days) through a complex feedback from the hormones produced in the ovary/endometrium which “signal” the hypothalamus and the pituitary on whether a change in the secretion of LH/FSH should occur or not. <strong>This hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis is the “metronome” for the menstruation cycle</strong> (see figure below for an overview of the HPO axis)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIDnb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIDnb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Several studies have investigated the effect of menstruation cycle phases on sleep and reported that menstrual cycle alter sleep organisation at different menstrual phases. Also, disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with disturbances in menstrual function. For example, female shiftworkers compared to non-shiftworkers are more likely to report menstrual irregularity and longer menstrual cycles. This is likely due to a change in the circulating hormone, <em>strengthening the role of “metronome” of the HPO in the time regulation of the menstruation cycle.</em></p>

"Smoking just after a workout","161","","<p>I smoke a cigarette just after workout at gym. Can that be more dangerous than smoking at a more ordinary time? For example, can it cause sudden cardiac arrest?</p>
","<p>Smoking in general is unhealthy.  Smoking can result in emphysema, COPD, pulmonary hypertension and other ugly diseases [1,2,3].  After a workout your heart and respiration rates are higher than at basal levels.  Although I do not have data to back me on this, based on scientific evidence on cardiopulmonary effects [4] after a workout and the hazards of smoking [1,2,3], I would deduce you would have higher nicotine intake, as well as other terrible chemicals that are in cigarettes.  I am not sure if cardiac arrest would be a primary concern with smoking but rather a secondary event to pulmonary hypertension [2,3]. In short I would seek advice and support on quitting smoking.</p>

<p>I have seen a urologist and other physicians and have had testing done. They confirmed that I have no physical issue.</p>

<p>I have elevated prolactin, which my psychiatrist says is caused by Soltus, which I take for depression.  He has recommended to reduce and stop it.</p>

<p>I also used to inject myself with testosterone.</p>

<p>I think I have porn-induced erectile dysfunction and am on day 40 of abstaining.</p>

<p>I tried Viagra like medicines but no effect.</p>

<p><strong>I am asking whether there are any drugs for ed which do not require sexual stimulation to work, as viagra-like drugs require sexual stimulation to get an erection.</strong></p>
","<p>We can't give medical advice here.  But I can guide you in how to approach talking with your doctors, and add another doctor/specialist you haven't mentioned but should see.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You have already told us that you have elevated prolactin - which
has a known association with erectile dysfunction.</p></li>
<li><p>You have already told us that you have depression, which has a known
association with erectile dysfunction.</p></li>
<li><p>You have already told us that you have recently started to refrain
from high porn use, which is known to sometimes have an association
with erectile dysfunction.</p></li>
<li><p>You have already told us that you used to inject yourself with
testosterone and now levels are down, so you've been messing with
your hormones exogenously.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So you have 4 <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/444220-differential"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">possible reasons for erectile dysfunction</a>: two hormonal, two neuropsychological.</p>

<p>None of these issues are resolved yet, so I might recommend talking with your doctors and working on those before trying to find a medication that could have additional side effects.  A pill might not exist for the purpose you're seeking.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Did you talk with your urologists about whether there are other medication options? They need to guide you as they are DOCTORS who specialize in this!  Make sure they know about all of the other factors as well, including your psych meds, depression, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>As your psychiatrist has already said, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amisulpride"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amisulpride</a> is</p>

  hormone, prolactin (thereby potentially causing the absence of the
  menstrual cycle, breast enlargement, even in males, breast milk
  secretion not related to breastfeeding, impaired fertility, <strong><em>impotence</em></strong>,
  breast pain, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so talk with your psychiatrist about options for your depression - he already recommended considering it! BUT note that soltus is an uncommon medication for unipolar depression, so <strong><em>do NOT adjust your medication without your psychiatrist's careful guidance.</em></strong>  </p></li>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>I recommend you <a href=""http://www.apa.org/topics/sex/treatment.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see a psyCHOLogist/counselor/therapist</a></strong> as soon as you can get in.

  <p>You may believe that you will have difficulty with this forever or that is not solvable unless you take medication for the problem but a pill may not fix all of the trouble.
  Here's why.... For most men, erectile problems are caused by an
  anxiety issue, not a medical issue. While prescriptions such as
  Viagra, Levitra and Cialis may help to solve the problem of getting
  your penis hard, you may not get to the core of why your penis is
  having difficulty getting hard in the first place. By then you are
  committed to taking prescriptions and ""timing"" when we are sexual for
  the rest of your sexual relationship. Getting to the core of the
  anxiety and taking back control of your body is what we will be

"Long-term effects of lens removal as the vitreous ages?","154","","<p>In a case of pediatric cataract surgery where the lens was not replaced, there is no lens to serve as a barrier between the aqueous and the vitreous.  I once asked an ophthalmologist what keeps them from mixing together in that case -- are they of different viscosities, like oil and water, for instance?  She said it's something like that, but that with aging the vitreous gradually thins (causing floaters, among things) and they end up blending together.  She said this isn't really a problem in practice, as each humour's main function is to deliver nutrients to the right parts of the eye and they can still do that.</p>

<p>I understand that the aqueous drains through a duct, so that part isn't a closed system.  But the vitreous usually is a closed system, as I understand it, which is why floaters don't go away.  A remedy for floaters that is sometimes brought up is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"" rel=""nofollow"">vitrectomy</a>, but that carries risk of retinal detachment (according to Wikipedia, and I think I remember hearing that from an ophthalmologist too).</p>

<p>Putting all of these together, it seems possible that with aging, as the vitreous becomes less distinct from the aqueous, some of the vitreous might end up draining through the same duct that the aqueous drains through, in an eye with no lens to serve as a barrier.  Is that the case?  And if it is, does it carry with it a higher risk of the things that can go wrong with vitrectomy (especially retinal detachment)?  Or does the risk that comes with that procedure not arise with a slow, gradual aging process?</p>

<p>Update: I've seen a reference to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_membrane"" rel=""nofollow"">hyaloid membrane</a>, which, in addition to the lens, sits between the vitreous and aqueous.  I don't know if this membrane is also removed when a lens is removed or if it remains.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>...it seems possible that with aging, as the vitreous becomes less distinct from the aqueous, some of the vitreous might end up draining through the same duct that the aqueous drains through, in an eye with no lens to serve as a barrier. Is that the case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a normal (i.e. lens intact) eye, that would, I think, be a problem.</p>

<p>The aqueous humor is a self-replenishing system, whereas the vitreous humor is made and completed before birth. There is no replenishment of it, although, because it is near a capillaries bed, there is diffusion of small molecules like glucose back and forth that takes place between the blood and the vitreous humor.</p>

<p>You're correct that the vitreous humor (initially a very well organized gel-like substance) liquifies as aging occurs, but the predominant effect of this is floaters (vitreous detachments*), retinal pulls, tears, hemorrhages and detachments.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GcKKZ.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Fluid (aqueous humor) is produced by cells in the ciliary body (which is part of the ciliary muscle, with ligamentous connections to the edge of the lens) behind the iris. This fluid-filled space is called the posterior chamber. The fluid then passes from behind the iris into the anterior chamber, between the iris and the cornea, and finally drains through a permeable network (the trabecular meshwork) near the base of your the anterior part of the iris. So, there is constant production and drainage of aqueous humor, keeping the fluid level balanced.</p>

<p>When too much fluid is made, or not reabsorbed, the anterior chamber bulges, deforming the shape of the vitreous humor and placing pressure on the optic nerve. There is no fluid exchange between the two unless there is disease of the posterior chamber.</p>

<p>When the vitreous humor liquifies, the volume stays the same. If it could drain out of the trabecular meshwork, I would imagine there would be a much greater risk of more serious vitreous detachments and subsequent  retinal detachments.</p>

<p>In the case of a lens removed in childhood, the vitreous humor, being a highly organized gel, is probably little affected by lens removal. With age, because liquifaction happens from the middle of the vitreous; the effect of loss of the lens is still probably small, but I imagine - I'm not an opthalmologist - it might be different for someone who has had a lifetime to accommodate. </p>

<p>(I might have to read and edit this answer again.)</p>

"Are afternoon naps healthy?","153","","<p>I live in a hostel and I observe that in weekends, some of my friends are very desperate for an outing or a day trip. But there are some exceptional ones who like to sleep after their lunch, and it results in taking small naps in lectures too.</p>

<p>According to some people, they feel fresh after those naps. Health wise, is it good to sleep after lunch?</p>
","<p>Below are reasons why afternoon naps are healthy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Provides a memory boost
In one study, participants who napped regularly for 10-, 20-, and 30-minute periods improved their performance on cognitive tests of memory and vigilance conducted in the subsequent two and a half hours. While those who napped more than 20 minutes suffered from grogginess, the 10-minute nappers experienced an immediate boost in performance. Other studies have shown similar findings.</p></li>
<li><p>Lowers blood pressure
A study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that the “siesta habit” is associated with a 37 percent reduction in coronary mortality, possibly because of reduced cardiovascular stress associated with daytime sleep. While they admit that they don’t know whether the benefit came from the nap itself, a reclined position, or merely just the expectation of a nap, they concluded that this decrease in blood pressure may be why lower coronary mortality has been found in those who take naps.</p></li>
<li><p>Calms your nerves:
A University of Berkeley study found that a 90-minute nap can potentially keep you calm. When study participants were shown faces that expressed anger, fear and happiness at noon, and then again at 6:00 p.m. They found that the subjects were significantly more upset by angry and fearful faces later in the day; but not if they had a 90-minute lunchtime nap in which they experienced REM sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Improves alertness
Well it's not much of a surprise here, but nonetheless, the National Sleep Foundation reports that a NASA study on sleepy military pilots and astronauts found that a 40-minute nap improved performance by 34 percent and alertness 100 percent. While you may not be driving a rocket ship, the foundation recommends a quick nap before driving your car to reduce the risk of a drowsy driving car crash.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhances creativity
The mind loves a nap. Daytime sleep can, “enhance creative thinking, boost cognitive processing, improve memory recall and generally clear out the cobwebs,"" James Maas and Rebecca Robbins, co-founders of Sleep for Success, wrote in The New York Times.</p></li>

"Current Theories on Ice vs. Heat for injuries","153","","<p>So I will preface this by saying I've heard a couple of things that I will list out for legibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Ice should be used for Acute injuries and Heat for Chronic injuries""</li>
<li>""Ice restricts blood flow therefore slows healing while Heat enhances blood flow and immune response.""</li>
</ul>

<p>For the sake of argument lets say an Acute Injury is defined by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharp well-defined pain upon using or pressing area</li>
<li>Constantly present</li>
<li>Possible bleeding/bruising</li>
<li>Occurred within the past week</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets also say a Chronic Injury is defined as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dull pain upon using or pressing area that becomes sharp with prolonged agitation</li>
<li>Lasting longer than a week</li>
<li>Comes and goes depending on activity</li>
<li>No bleeding/bruising present</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at such cases what has research shown is the most effective way of tackling such injuries? I would guess that they are treated differently seeing as they are considered different types of injury. </p>

<p>If two patients sprained their left ankle in the exact same manner I imagine the one who sprained his yesterday will be treated differently than the one still experiencing problems from a month old sprain.</p>

<p>Since this is something that does cover a broad spectrum of issues I will coalesce it into four relatively specific questions of what I am looking for.</p>

<p>Are there studies/data showing that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat improves healing response for injuries, while Cold reduces it.</li>
<li>Icing acute injuries gives better outcome than heating or doing nothing at all.</li>
<li>Heating chronic injuries gives better outcome than icing or doing nothing at all.</li>
<li>The RICE method is truly effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>For simplicity sake consider the question of this post to be: ""Are there any conventional theories/study/data that prove whether Ice or Heat is better for injury treatment?""</p>

<p>EDIT: For clarity I should note I am not asking if pain is reduced but the underlying issue causing the pain. I am looking for studies/data showing what is the best <em>treatment</em> for enabling recovery.</p>
","<p>There is only marginal evidence of RICE (rest, ice, elevation and compression) improving recovery in injuries. </p>

<p>For example, in a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754753"" rel=""nofollow"">review of 22 studies of ankle injuries</a>, ice and elevation had only marginal effects on recovery. </p>

<p>In another review of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18212134"" rel=""nofollow"">six studies in soft tissue injuries</a>, there was no evidence that ice was effective. </p>

<p>In a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11403116"" rel=""nofollow"">review of 45 sports medicine textbooks</a>, the advice on the use of ice varied in the textbooks. </p>

<p>Some individual studies such as <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23364294"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> do show evidence for decreased pain and some increased range of motion earlier for ice used in the first 72 hours. </p>

<p>Importantly, studies don't seem to suggest there is a harm. The short answer, which we often use to guide decisions in medicine, is ""Can't hurt. Might help.""</p>

<p>The ""can't hurt"" is conditional as only if done properly: don't ice directly on the skin as that is known to have caused frostbite. Wrap the ice in a cloth. Don't ice longer than 20 minutes. (Some studies say 10 minutes.)</p>

"Rheumatoid arthritis heritability","151","","<p>Is there any scientific information available on how likely it is that a child with one parent with rheumatoid arthritis will have the same condition? I know there's probably not going to be any hard numbers available, but are there any studies at all on this? </p>
","<p><strong>Odds vary.</strong></p>

<p>The most straightforward study I could find was <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9263145"" rel=""nofollow"">Koumantaki et al. (1997)</a>, which found several odds ratios for developing rheumatoid arthritis:</p>

<ul>
<li>4.4 for individuals having a first degree relative with the disease.</li>
<li>5.4 for individuals having a female first degree relative with the disease.</li>
<li>7.0 for females having a first degree relative with the disease.</li>
<li>4.8 for females whose mother has the disease.</li>
<li>8.6 for individuals whose mother has the disease.</li>
<li>1.1 for females whose father has the disease.</li>
<li>1.9 for individuals whose father has the disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>An odds ratio of X means that a person is with the given characteristic is X time more likely to have the disease than a person without it. The higher the odds ratio, the greater the chance of the individual inheriting the disease. From this, it is easy to see that those with mothers with rheumatoid arthritis were more likely to inherit it, especially if the individuals were female.</p>

<p>A different study, <a href=""http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.123251!/file/GORA-Newsletter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">the GoRA study (summary)</a> found that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if one of your parents, or a sibling (one of your brothers or sisters) has RA, your risk of developing RA will be slightly higher (around a 16% chance) than someone that does not have a family member affected with this illness (around a 0.8% chance).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would seem to give an odds ratio of about 20 - much higher than any of the other results.</p>

<p>In addition, I've found numbers from <a href=""http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/arthritis-and-daily-life/pregnancy-and-arthritis/what-are-the-chances-of-my-child-having-arthritis.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Arthritis Research UK</a> (no studies cited) which says that the probability of a child getting rheumatoid arthritis from a parent is about 1-3%.</p>

<p>Going even further, a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/rheumatoid-arthritis/print.html"" rel=""nofollow""><em>New York Times</em> Health article</a> claims that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people may inherit genes that make them more susceptible to developing RA, but a family history of RA does not appear to increase an individual's risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also goes along with Koumantaki et al.'s findings that women are more likely to get the disease than men.</p>

<p>It seems like the jury is still out on this, although most studies of the genetics behind rheumatoid arthritis focus on which genes might be transferred, or related hypotheses. Many authors conclude that more research on the subject is needed, especially as the origins of the disease are not well known.</p>

<p>Children will tend to play sports much earlier than they can strength train. Those sports and basic calisthenics teach motor control, discipline, and physical prowess. This will provide a great base if you move into supplemental strength training as they become older and can pay attention to training and form elements. In any case, as long as the exercise is age appropriate (Such as don't have your 10 year old squatting 250) and supervised, there shouldn't be an impact.</p>

<p>From there, you have kids who are:</p>

<li>Used to moving their bodies.</li>
<li>Used to drills/skills: activities that are not sports themselves, but necessary for helping sports.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also consider the following two study excerpts:</p>

  <p>Experimental training protocols with weights and resistance machines and with supervision and low instructor/participant ratios are relatively safe and do not negatively impact growth and maturation of pre- and early pubertal youth.</p>

<p>With all of that, there is the possibility that pushing children in exercise programs without paying attention to rest and nutrition needs could possibly result in growth impairment due to overly high stress levels or malnutrition.

"Does wart treatment (such as freezing) kill the wart or only triger the bodies natural immune reaction?","150","","<p>I’ve heard competing claims about (plantar) wart treatment. Some doctors say freezing it with liquid nitrogen is to kill the wart, while trying to minimize the damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Other doctors say it is just to irritate the body enough to stimulate the natural immune system response, and that’s what gets rid of the wart. Can the body’s own immune system be enough to get rid of the wart?</p>

","<p><strong>It does both</strong>. </p>

<p>The center of the wart is weakened/killed with the acid/nitrogen(cold), while the periphery is damaged (both the wart and the skin around it). </p>

<p>Because the wart is weakened, the body's natural reparation process slowly replaces the missing skin (under and around the wart) faster than the wart can grow, while the immune system prevents it from spreading within the area. </p>

"Green Tea: Would it cause any harm?","149","","<p>I've recently started to drink green tea and I enjoy it a lot. I drink about 3 cups daily but I feel like being kind of addicted to it. I've got an oddly strong desire to drink more like 7 or 8 cups. Is that harmful? Could it hurt me?</p>
","<p>Aside from its wonderful taste, green tea (obtained from the plant <em>Cammelia sinensis</em>, (L.) Kuntze, Theaceae) contains caffeine, and this might be the reason for your possible addiction. Studies have shown that caffeine withdrawal symptoms exist and that their intensity is correlated to the amount of caffeine that was being used previously, and the frequency of use. That being said, tea contains other ingredients: catechins, flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives etc. While tea has been proven to have many beneficial effects (there have been extensive clinical studies in China and Japan, which have proven that tea consumption is correlated with decreased risk of some types of cancer)</p>

<h2>7 - 8 cups of tea per day is way too much!</h2>

<p>Why? There are two main reasons:</p>

<h2>Caffeine</h2>

<p>Aside from being addictive, too much caffeine can cause an overdose. Possible symptoms are: restlessness, tremor and elevated reflex excitability. An overdose can also cause headaches or dizziness, abnormal hearth rhythms, dehydration or sleep problems. According to PDR overdose occurs in doses corresponding to 300 mg of caffeine (approximately 5 cups of tea as a beverage). Even in ""regular"" amounts, caffeine can affect blood pressure, so people with these problems ought to be careful.
Tea is, of course, not the only source of caffeine, so when deciding on the daily amount of tea, all sources of caffeine should be taken into account.</p>

<h2>Possible anemia</h2>

<p>Tannines in tea precipitate iron. If this happens in your digestive system it means that iron becomes insoluble, and cannot be absorbed. This decreases the effective uptake by your body, while regular loss via excretion and  desquamation remains the same, so over time you start having less and less iron at your body's disposal, which can lead to anemia. There were several studies that have proven this effect - many were epidemiological and observational. There was a clinical trial involving patients with haemochromatosis which also proved that drinking tea reduced iron absorption from the GIT.</p>

<hr>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>

<p>Drinking decaf tea might solve the first problem, but won't solve the second. Moderation is the key. Also, drinking tea with or right after meals (especially those which are the greatest source of iron) should be avoided most of the times. Drinking tea is an indulgent ritual for many, so perhaps switching one or two cups a day for a herbal tea might help.</p>

<hr>

<p>An interesting aside: PDR cites studies which have proven that tea mouthwashes can reduce growth of some cavity-associated bacteria and reduce formation of plaque (the 2nd goes for oolong). But tanines can deposit on your teeth causing them to turn yellow, so rinsing your teeth with tea is a double-edged sword.</p>

The sleep-wake cycle follows a regular pattern (circadian rhythm) and when you sleep “too much” that pattern shifts. Circadian rhythms are the patterns of repeated activity associated with the environmental cycles of day and night that are repeated every 24 hours.
Once our body clocks start to tell our body the wrong time we feel it in lethargy and fatigue. The clock says one thing and your body says another, very similar to jet lag. 
The average sleep cycle lasts between 80-120 minutes (the average is 90 minutes) and the average person has five of these every night (totaling about 7.5 hours of deep sleep).<br>

"Cancer development probability with age","148","","<p>What is the relation between age and cancer development probability? I have heard that cancer is rather rare at younger age groups.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The National Cancer Institute</a> states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advancing age is the most important risk factor for cancer overall, and for many individual cancer types. According to the most recent statistical data from NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66 years. This means that half of cancer cases occur in people below this age and half in people above this age. One-quarter of new cancer cases are diagnosed in people aged 65 to 74.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer all have median ages of diagnosis between 61 and 70 years. That said, the NCI does note that some cancers occur more often in younger age groups, citing bone cancers (where the most at-risk age group is adolescents under 20) and leukemias.</p>

<p>The NCI also provides a bar graph showing the percentage of new cancers in various age groups, broken down mostly in ten-year increments:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rSEYFtb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/rSEYFtb.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>This would seem to indicate that your cancer risk goes down after about the age of 70. However, this is clearly misleading, because fewer and fewer people survive to reach these higher age groups. Thus, with fewer people in that group alive, there is going to be a significant drop in the percentage of cancers that occur in that group.</p>

<p><a href=""http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2012/results_merged/topic_lifetime_risk.pdf#13"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">More accurate tables</a> exist, which show the chance of developing cancer within a certain amount of time at a given age (data from 2010-2012). Table 2.12 in the linked document shows that the chances of developing cancer within 10, 20, or 30 years increases with age (although long-term data is not available for the higher age groups, as most people at the age of 80 do not live for 20 or 30 more years.</p>

<p>An interesting effect, though, is that the chance of ever developing cancer does change, increasing by small - negligible, even - amounts from the age of 0-30, and decreasing by the same small amounts from there, until there is a sharp drop-off at the age of 60. The table shows that if, for example, you're 70 years old, then you're less likely to get cancer during the rest of your life than someone 40 years old. The reason for this, of course, is more morbid: other diseases that are more common or more deadly in old age will set in at older ages. Less time to live implies less time to develop cancer.</p>

<p>To make this less confusing, at younger ages, your risk of developing cancer within a small amount of time - your instantaneous risk - steadily increases. At ages past 30, however, your risk of developing cancer throughout the rest of your life steadily decreases.</p>

"Is it true that alcohol is the only ""drug"" one can die from during a drug-withdrawal? What are the symptoms of the withdrawal?","147","","<p>Is it true that alcohol is the only ""drug"" one can die from during a drug-withdrawal? Someone recently told me they heard this from rehab, but it doesn't resonate as true... but then again, I'm not expert in health matters. </p>

<p>What are the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal?</p>
","<p>In addition to alcohol, benzodiazepines and the opiates (rare), another class of drugs that can cause lethal withdrawal symptoms is the barbiturates. In fact, they present the most dangerous withdrawal of all. Their use has largely been replaced with the benzodiazepines, so abuse is much less common today than it was in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Withdrawing from Barbiturates</strong></p>
  
  <p>Within 2 to 3 months of consistent barbiturate use, a person can
  develop a tolerance and addiction. Once this has happened, it is
  important to understand that a doctor or rehab for barbiturates should
  be [employed] to come off of the medication. As a “GABAergic” drug;
  <strong>barbiturate withdrawal can produce life threatening effects, like
  seizures, which are similar to those of delirium tremens and
  benzodiazepine withdrawals. However, the barbiturate withdrawal can be
  even more severe than the aforementioned making it one of the most

  the longer acting the barbiturate drug is, the less severe the

"What is the relation between the sensation of being full and the ability to fall asleep?","147","","<p>I struggle with insomnia. Sometimes if I'm not able to fall asleep, one of the best ways to resolve this is to munch until I feel full, and I get so sleepy that I almost can't make it to the bedroom without passing out. The meal would be less than only 500 calories, so I don't think this is the same as the effect you get on thanksgiving.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>...I don't think this is the same as the effect you get on thanksgiving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it probably is, and soon some people will be able to get that same sleep-inducing effect in the form of a pill.</p>

<p>Your sleepiness after a meal is caused by the <s>presence or absence</s> decrease of peptides in your brain called orexins (aka hypocretins).</p>

<p>In 1998, two groups of researchers simultaneously discovered 2 small neuropeptide hormones that regulate, among other things, wakefulness and feeding behavior. </p>

<p>One group discovered them while searching for molecules that could bind to ""orphan"" receptors, that is, a brain receptor with an unknown ""binding"" molecule (called a ligand). They found that the prohormone <em>prepro-orexin</em> was found in a very small area of the hypothalamus which had been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis; this suggested the possibility that the neuropeptides might be involved in the regulation of food intake. When administered into free-feeding rats' brains, one of these peptides (orexin A/hypocretin 1) stimulated food consumption in a dose-dependent manner (with attention to light and dark periods, i.e. the circadian rhythm), with a lower dose increasing rat feeding about 2-fold, and the higher dose inducing a 3+-fold increase in feeding compared to rats injected with a solution without the peptide (the other stimulated feeding to a lesser degree). The effect persisted for 4 hours. Furthermore, fasting rats produced more than twice as much orexins as rats feeding freely. For this reason, the molecules were names ""orexins"", after the Greek word <em>orexis</em>, which means ""appetite"". They speculated that the orexin-secreting neurons might somehow be modulated by glucose.</p>

<p>At the same time, another group of researchers using a completely different approach found that the same group of hypothalamic neurons were stimulated by a peptide hormone similar in composition to the gut hormone <em>secretin</em>. They identified the same prohormone and its two peptides, naming them <em>hypocretins</em> for ""hypothalamus"" and ""secretin"". They found that at least one of the peptides had a neuroexcitatory activity in specific areas of the brain (they mapped effects in the hypothalamic neurons, the posterior hypothalamus, the septal nuclei in the basal forebrain, the preoptic area, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the colliculi, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract) suggesting that the peptides acted within the central nervous system as homeostatic regulators with a role in nutritional homeostasis.</p>

<p>Scientists have not decided on whether to call them <em>orexins</em> or <em>hypocretins</em> yet, so both are used. They are found in all vertebrates.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b3FeV.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><sub>Mammalian orexin A sequences thus far identified (human, rat, mouse, pig, dog, sheep, and cow) are all identical, whereas the sequences of orexin B show some differences among species. From <em>Orexin/Hypocretin: A Neuropeptide at the Interface of Sleep, Energy Homeostasis, and Reward System</em>, Natsuko Tsujino and Takeshi Sakurai </sub></p>

<p>In 1999, a group of scientists found that narcolepsy (a sleep disorder characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness) was caused by a lack of a hypocretin/orexin receptor 2 gene in certain dogs, therefore establishing that they play a very important part in the regulation of wakefulness.*</p>

<p>Since then, an enormous body of work has shown that orexins/hypocretins (O/H from here on in) are involved in the regulation of a wide range of behaviors, including wakefulness and vigilance (needed to find food), systems that regulate emotion and reward (including drug-seeking behavior when stressed and eating for pleasure - ""consumption beyond homeostatic needs"" - leading to obesity), and more.**</p>

<p><strong>What does eating have to do with sleepiness?</strong></p>

<p>Several studies report that the firing rates of O/H neurons are influenced by serum glucose, triglycerides and amino acids. </p>

<p>In English, and in your case: You are awake (O/H is being secreted by O/H neurons in your hypothalamus). You eat. Your serum glucose rises. The elevated glucose causes depolarization of inhibitory neurons <em>that hyperpolarize O/H neurons decreasing the amount of O/H. released.</em> Result: wakefulness decreases. (You can barely make it to your bed, in your case!)</p>

<p><strong>What about Thanksgiving in a pill?</strong></p>

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved suvorexant (Belsomra) for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The (prescription only) drug is an <em>orexin receptor antagonist</em> and is the first approved drug of this type. It blocks the effect of orexin in wakefulness (isn't science grand?) Unlike benzodiazepines and other hypnotics, rather than promoting sleep, suvorexant inactivates wakefulness, and rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were not observed when suvorexant was discontinued after 3 months or 12 months of <em>nightly</em> use. It does have risks and side effects, but so far its safety profile looks pretty good.</p>

It was only later that I realized that it was muscle pains near my shoulder that was causing my headache and that I should've taken ibuprofen instead.</p>

<p>Is it safe to take ibuprofen (200mg) if I've already taken paracetamol 5 hours before?</p>
","<p>Yes, it is safe. The mechanism that ibuprofen and paracetamol use are different and don't interact negatively. In fact, the two drugs (medicines) can be used in conjunction for a synergistic effect so that it will provide greater pain relief than either drug alone. With that said, still follow the standard dosing instructions for each drug. That means don't take more than 3000 Mg of paracetamol in one day (24 hours) (this is a strict limit, can cause permanent damage  if you exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours) and don't take more than 1200 mg of ibuprofen in any 24 hour period or you risk stomach bleeding.

<p>How can gut bacteria be increased? Are there any medications for this?</p>
","<p>You have no lack of gut bacteria, that much is very safe to say. Everyone has gut bacteria in spades. The gut bacteria that you do have may not be the optimal, but <em>no one even knows what the optimal gut microbiome/microbiota is.</em> The study of the effects of different populations of gut flora is in its infancy. The most intensive studies are being carried out in animal models, and their applicability to humans is not yet guaranteed.</p>

<p>Can a person change their microbiome with probiotics? Researchers are still dubious. There is a lot of research that indicates that the intestinal flora you carry throughout your life is largely determined in early infancy. Others believe that the microbiome changes over time; this has been shown to occur especially due to illness or antibiotic use.</p>

<p>The two areas of greatest study in humans is <em>obesity</em> (associated with certain strains of gut bacteria in certain populations) and as a treatment for Clostridium Difficile colitis, and none of the findings can be generalized yet to the ""normal"" population. Inflammatory Bowel Disease had been studied as well, and some other disorders, to a lesser extent. But how to change our microbiomes is far from a known fact.</p>

<p>However, what scientists who study the gut microbiome do agree on is that <em>a healthy diet is a better way to cultivate a healthy gut microbiome than taking supplements or eating a particular kind of food</em>. Most specialists do not recommend, for example, eating yogurt as an effective way to ingest probiotics. Most yogurts (including those with live cultures) don't have enough CFU's/serving to make a difference, and don't have a diversity of active cultures.</p>

<p>By a healthy diet, they mean a diet rich in plant-based foods, low in processed foods, and (using the average Western diet as a basis) decreased amounts of red meat, high-fat food, and sugars.</p>

<p>In other words, a probiotic is not proven or even likely to help you, whereas a healthier diet is. </p>

<p>Of course, you should seek the opinion of a doctor for your digestion problem. In the meantime, a food/symptom diary is a good idea. There may be a food allergy or sensitivity at the root of your problem, and a food/symptom diary could help determine that.</p>

<p>I have personally lost almost 20 pounds in just 24 hours in a weight loss experiment - just to prove how much water weight can be lost (without burning off almost no body fat). And guess what...all that lost weight came back after just 2 days on my normal diet.</p>

<p>In other words, those 100 grams could easily mean you drank 1 extra dl of water, or that you didn't visit the toilet before weighing, or something similarly insignificant.</p>

<p>The only way to be sure whether or not you're gaining/losing actual body fat would be if you actually measured your body fat percentage...but even in this case, the measurements would not be precise enough to confirm what's actually happening if your weight changes by mere 100 grams.</p>

"How long a certain food takes for making intestinal gas?","143","","<p>I've some symptoms of IBS. I want to know some stuff on the basis of my symptoms that I've observed. I know Apples, Melons or milk can cause gas. </p>

<p>For <strong>instance</strong>, before quitting milk, when I would drink milk after dinner and sit for half an hour Computer work, I would feel pain in my abdomen, most probably because of gas and then I would sleep to feel comfort.</p>

<p>On <strong>another occasion</strong>, I eat melon a few days ago and I felt gassy during next 24 hours. Also, recently I was eating vegetable made from Raw Melon (it's know in my area, don't know about others) and I felt slightly more gassy.</p>

<p>As my gastroenterologist doesn't know much and doesn't tell me much, I want to know the TIME after taking/eating them when we feel gas, just to make sure if Milk, and these fruits and vegetables are actually causing gas.</p>

<p>Wherever I asked the question about lactose/fructose intolerance, they suggested me to check myself by eliminating foods. So that's what I'm doing these days. I see improvement but not much.</p>

<p>Is it just after 1-2-3 hours of taking these products (this is related to my milk related issue)? If yes then how is it possible because things take at least 15-20 hours to reach large intestine? (I'm asking this because some sites say milk can cause gas after a few minutes of taking it!)</p>

<p>Or is it actually when it reaches large intestine, undigested after 15-20 hours?</p>

<p>I request you to further elaborate the time that my take especially milk, melon and apples in causing gas, so that I would properly know these are the real culprits.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>The average bowel transit time - the time needed for a food to travel from mouth to stool - in a healthy person is probably around 12-14 hours. Source: <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003887.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">MedlinePlus</a></p>

<p>When a certain food or nutrient (lactose, fructose) irritates the bowel, the bowel transit time can be much shorter and it could very well be just 2-3 hours. But abdominal pain, gas or loose stools in IBS can appear even faster than that concluded from the bowel transit time, for example as soon as 15 minutes after a meal. This is because the stool and gas you excrete does not come from your last meal but more likely from your previous meals.</p>

<p>It is gastrocolic reflex that causes the movements of your large intestine, when the food reaches your stomach. This is why breakfast helps to have a bowel movement in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Apples and mangoes are high in ""net fructose,"" which means they contain more fructose than glucose. When a person has less symptoms after removing foods high in net fructose from the diet, it means he can have fructose malabsorption (FM), which is described in detail here <a href=""http://www.nutrientsreview.com/carbs/monosaccharides-fructose.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Foods high in <strong>net fructose</strong> (to avoid in FM): apples, pears, mangoes, agave, watermelon, honey, beverages sweetened by high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), carambola, feijoa, nance, guava, grapes (for more detailed list see the link above).</p>

<p>Additionally, a person with FM can have gas and loose stools after eating foods high in <strong>sorbitol</strong> and other sugar alcohols (polyols), such as <strong>xylitol, maltitol or mannitol,</strong> which can be found in ""sugar-free"" chewing gum, certain low-calorie drinks, prunes, grapes, sweet cherries, apricots and peaches.</p>

<p>Additionally, a person with FM can get gas after eating foods high in <strong>fructooligosaccharides (FOS):</strong> Jerusalem artichokes, red onions and bananas.</p>

<p>NOTE, that not all foods high in fructose should be avoided, but only foods high in ""net fructose"" (described in the above link).</p>

<p>If a person who has fructose malabsorption as the only or main gastrointestinal problem, eliminates foods with nutrients marked in bold above, he should see an obvious improvement within <strong>48 hours</strong> and more improvement within a week. After improvement, a person can try to introduce certain less suspicious foods back (but only one food in 48 hours to be able to identify eventual symptoms).</p>

<p>A person who has FM, often has a slight problem in absorbing lactose due to <em>temporary</em> lactose intolerance, so it can help if he avoids milk, curd, yogurt, ice cream (cheese and butter should be fine).</p>

<p>Elimination of all nutrients mentioned above at once is called a <a href=""http://www.nutrientsreview.com/carbs/fodmaps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">low-FODMAP diet</a>.</p>

<p>So, when someone thinks he has FM, he can start with a low-fructose diet or a bit more thorough low-FODMAP diet.</p>

<p>People who have FM often think they have IBS. If one wants to be officially diagnosed, he can ask a gastroenterologist to perform a ""hydrogen breath test with fructose."" The condition is usually life-long.</p>

<p>Fructose malabsorption should not be confused with a rare hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), which can cause much more severe symptoms after consumption of even minute amounts of fructose.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I did not diagnosed anyone here with FM, but this post can help people who have IBS-like symptoms (gas, loose stools, vague abdominal pains).</p>

<p>Similar conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Food allergies usually cause <em>itching and tingling around the mouth</em> within few minutes of ingestion. An allergologist can make a diagnosis on the basis of the skin test.</li>
<li>Intestinal parasites can cause various abdominal symptoms. A gastroenterologist can make a diagnosis from a stool test.</li>

","<p>There are a couple variables, let me explain. </p>

<p>An ulcer itself is not contagious. It is just an open sore that won't heal properly. What exactly causes an ulcer to occur needs to be determined by a physician. Contact lense wearers and individuals whom scratch the cornea are more susceptible to ulcers and bacterial issues. The short answer is no the ulcer is not contagious. HOWEVER if the ulcer is a result of bacterial infection it very well could be. Bacteria is non discriminatory, so you could possibly pick something up if you come into contact with any objects or non sterile material that someone else touches or has. </p>

<p>Rubbing eyes, or sharing contact lense solution could possibly transfer bacterium. Nothing is contagious as long as you take the proper medical precaution. It's best to practice very good hygiene.</p>

"What is the best cooking oil for a person with ischemic heart disease?","143","","<p>My grandmother has atherosclerosis and suffers from cardiovascular disease (ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease). </p>

<p>The doctor recommended her not to eat butter or ghee. </p>

<p>Which type of oil (maize oil, sunflower, olive oil) could be considered as alternative in her case?</p>
","<p>To make it simple: There are two types of fat: unsaturated (""good fat"") and saturated and trans fat (""bad fat"").</p>

<p>Current dietary guidelines (American Heart Association, WHO) suggest that saturated fats should be limited to &lt;10% (5-6% for those who would benefit from lowering of LDL cholesterol), and trans fats to &lt;1% of energy or as low as possible. The main purpose of these restrictions is to reduce risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke.</p>

<p>WebMD (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/features/cholesterol-and-cooking-fats-and-oils?page=2"">http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/features/cholesterol-and-cooking-fats-and-oils?page=2</a>) provides an exhaustive list, where unsaturated and saturated fat can be found:</p>

<p><strong>Unsaturated fat:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Monounsaturated fat</strong> is the primary type found in olive, canola, and sesame oils, as well as in avocados and avocado oil, and in nuts
  and their oils. <strong>Polyunsaturated fat</strong> is prevalent in corn, cottonseed,
  and safflower oils; sunflower seeds and sunflower oil; flaxseed and
  flaxseed oil; soybeans and soybean oil; tub margarine and soft
  spreads; and seafood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Saturated fat:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coconut oil, palm, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter supply large
  amounts of saturated fat, too, but are cholesterol-free. (...) Trans fat is
  found in stick margarine, some tub margarine, and in shortening, as
  well as in some processed foods such as cookies, crackers, and pastry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly a recent meta-analysis published (aggregation and synthetising of different studies) in the BMJ  (<a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978"">http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978</a>) has somehow questioned the ""negative effect"" of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease. But considering that their results were associated with a high heterogeneity (= how consistent the effect across the combined studies is, ie in this case low), larger studies are needed to confirm their results.</p>

<p>To your question: I have not found any study comparing directly different ""good fat"" oils together, so probably, considering one of the oils which contains unsaturated fat would be a wise choise (if you respect the dietary guidelines). Although, olive oil has been increasingly associated with reduced cardiovascular risk (<a href=""http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-78"">http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-78</a>), depending on your geographic location, this oil can be difficult to find.</p>

"Can the HPV vaccine be effective if you are already infected?","142","","<p>I was just wondering about this subject, when I did a blood exam today and I picked a paper about available vaccines and I saw HPV, the same my mom always bothered me to take it. </p>

<p>I'm an adult man with active sexual life, so would I benefit from taking a HPV vaccine? </p>

<p>According to Wikipedia : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HPV is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States.</p>
  
  <p>The American Social Health Association reported estimates that about 75–80% of sexually active Americans will be infected with HPV at some point in their lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The HPV vaccine is <em>most</em> effective when preventing you from initial infection. While common, it's possible you haven't been infected with HPV. Even if you are, there is some benefit to still being vaccinated if you're HPV positive. The reason for this is that there are a number of different types of HPV virus, and the vaccine should provide you some protection against types you have not already acquired. From <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6305a1.htm"">this MMWR report</a>, ""Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the phase III trials, among females aged 16–26 years who had HPV
  vaccine type DNA detected at study enrollment (either seropositive or
  seronegative), there was no efficacy against progression to disease or
  impact on clearance of infection of that type (114,120). However, HPV4
  had 100% efficacy for prevention of CIN2+ attributable to types not
  already acquired (120). Among persons seropositive to the relevant HPV
  type but HPV DNA-negative, too few cases were detected to evaluate
  efficacy, but disease incidence was low and all cases occurred in the
  placebo group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HPV vaccination can provide protection against infection with HPV
  vaccine types not already acquired. Therefore, vaccination is
  recommended through the recommended age for females regardless of
  whether they have an abnormal Pap test result, and for females or
  males regardless of known HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer
  lesions, or anogenital warts. Females who have abnormalities on
  cervical cancer screening are likely to be infected with one or more
  genital HPV types. With increasing severity of Pap test findings, the
  likelihood of infection with HPV 16 or HPV 18 increases (70), and the
  expected benefit of vaccination decreases. Females who have had HPV
  testing as part of cervical cancer screening might have information
  about their HPV status. Males or females with AIN are likely infected
  with HPV. The presence of anogenital warts or a history of anogenital
  warts indicates present or past infection with HPV, most often HPV 6
  or HPV 11. Although vaccination is still recommended, patients should
  be advised that vaccination will not have any therapeutic effect on an
  existing HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer lesion, cancer, or
  anogenital warts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: It is likely still worth getting vaccinated to protect you from other strains of HPV.</p>

"Itchy miscolored inflammed bump on elbow","142","","<p>For the past 48 hours, I've had a miscolored, raised patch of skin on my elbow that has been itching non-stop.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UXjDr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've applied topical diphenhydramine hydrochloride (2%), which seems to have no affect on the itchiness.  The only way to stop the itch has been to wrap it with an ice pack.</p>

<p>What are the possible causes of this?  Could it be serious enough that I need to consult a dermatologist?</p>
","<p>A proper diagnosis would require more questions for your particular situation.  For example:
 - Do you have, or have you had, a fever since you noticed this bump? 
 - Do you any other skin reactions anywhere else on your body? 
 - Did you have any scratches or broken surface of the skin in the area of the bump before you noticed it and the swelling started? 
 - Do you know of insects, ticks, or spiders that may be common in your area? If so, do you feel you may have been exposed to these?</p>

<p>It appears one possibility is a localized reaction resulting from an insect bite. The symptoms you are noticing are common after an arthropod bite, such as local discomfort or pain; pruritis (itchiness); and erythema (redness). Because there is blanching in the center with a ring of erythema around this, it may suggest a bite.</p>

<p>Another less likely possibility is cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous layer of tissue just below the skin. This can result from trauma to the skin such as a cut or a bite, when bacteria are able to enter through the disturbed skin surface. However, accompanying symptoms also include tenderness/pain at the site; chills; fever; and swollen lymph nodes near the site.</p>

<p>Ibuprofen (e.g. Motrin) taken orally should help decrease inflammation around the site of the swelling, thereby alleviating some of the itching and discomfort. The topical corticosteroids available over the counter may not be in the strength you need to counter an inflammatory or allergic reaction.  Due to this, it would be prudent to consult your health care provider if this does not start to resolve within the next 24 hours as it sometimes may two to three days for the initial symptoms to subside if this resulted from a bite. Also, if you develop other symptoms such as fever, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, or hives you should see your provider right away.</p>

<p>My question is, what are the differences between Triceba and Toujeo?  Do they have significant differences in effectiveness, side-effects, and ease of use?</p>
","<p>Triceba is actually Tresiba. It is a very long-acting basal insulin, that you take once a day. It is probably the best basal insulin today for people who do not have fast-changing basal needs like athletes: very insensitive to when you are taking it. </p>

<p>Toujeo is a 3x concentrated version of insulin glargine -- i.e. 3x Lantus. It acts roughly like Lantus, but its increased concentration gives it slightly different properties in terms of timing. The most interesting aspect of Toujeo is that it does not appear to wane ""too early"" as Lantus often does with many users (Lantus can wane sometimes in as little as 18 or 20 hours for some individuals). <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4790523/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This research paper</a> shows more sustaining power for Toujeo vs Lantus.</p>

<p>Both Tresiba and Toujeo are modern insulins that are superior in some ways to the old ones. One can be better than the other depending upon your need:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you need A LOT of insulin, then Toujeo is superior to Tresiba, because of its concentration. </li>
<li>if you have a significant waning problem with basal insulins, Toujeo would probably be better than any except Tresiba. Tresiba is the ultimate duration-optimized insulin.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a waning problem with Toujeo (rare but not impossible), approach your doctor and ask him for a letter of medical necessity, to explain to your insurance that the only insulin you can use really is Tresiba.

<p><strong>The mechanisms by which ultraviolet-A (UVA) (320–400 nm) and ultraviolet-B (UVB) (290–320 nm) induces photosensibility are however different.</strong> Following picture provides a good overview of our current understanding:</p>

"Is there any health benefit or detriment from bathing?","140","","<p><em>I want to begin by making it clear that I shower at least once per day, wear deodorant at all times, and while I am not a neat freak, I take care of my personal hygiene.  I am asking this question out of curiosity, not in an attempt to justify being filthy.</em></p>

<p>I would imagine that humans have been in the habit of bathing frequently for a relatively short period of time, and that prehistoric humans rarely, if ever, bathed their entire bodies, and only washed specific parts of their bodies when it was actually necessary (i.e., if they had to remove mud, blood, etc).</p>

<p>Even today, we tend to bathe for reasons that have nothing to do with health.  We do it out of habit, and for social reasons (e.g., not wanting to smell bad).  These are aesthetic and cultural motivations, not related to health.  </p>

<p>To be clear, I am not asking about washing hands, which obviously does have positive effects;  I am interested in the question of whether bathing <strong>the entire body</strong> is beneficial or detrimental.</p>

<p>Is there any health benefit or detriment, whether related to skin health, hair care, internal health, or anything else, from bathing the entire body?</p>

<hr>
","<p>One big problem here is that it's difficult to do double blind studies. One is then forced to use more theoretical arguments, but because medical science is not  a hard science like physics, such arguments are not very reliable. The best we can then do is argue from biological plausibility, in this case we should take serious the fact that Homo Sapiens evolved more than 200,000 years ago while people only started to take baths relatively recently. The adaptation via natural selection over hundreds of millions years since the first land animals evolved is thus still relevant for us. The human microbiome consisting of all the microbes that live on our skins, in our intestines is known to play non-trivial roles, but we don't know a lot about how this impacts our health (from rigorous randomly controlled trials) </p>

<p>This means that the null hypothesis should assume that never washing, bathing or taking showers is beneficial for health over even occasionally doing so. You should need strong evidence to overturn this null hypothesis. Such strong evidence is lacking, what evidence there is there is consistent with this null hypothesis. E.g. we can <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-28934415"">read here</a>:</p>

<p>I doubt there is much of a placebo effect at work, since most of these either did or did not work when I first took them, without having expectations either way.</p>

<p>Whenever I have a head ache, I take an APC. I suspect it's actually the aspirin in there that does the job, since when I take <em>just</em> paracetamol, it doesn't do squat. As a kid I got children's aspirin, which worked.</p>

<p>I once had a severe back ache. I was prescribed diclofenac (a larger dose than the over the counter version), which didn't work. I was then prescribed tramadol &mdash; same results. I then tried naproxen, which worked rightaway.</p>

<p><strong>Why do some pain killers work for me while others don't?</strong></p>

<p>Is there an underlying mechanism, that explains why some of these work for some people while others don't? Does that predict if pain killers that I haven't had to use yet will work?</p>

","<p>I viewed your question in the Biology Stack and I think the answers you received are quite good. I´ll try sum up those long answers in the Biology Stack and present them more clearly.</p>

<p>Major factor influencing to the presumed effects of any drug is the first pass effect <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wikipedia)</a>. That means that every substance taken orally must absorb from intestine to the surrounding blood stream. All this blood with all absorbed substance (incl. sugar, fat, protein from food) are transported to liver. Liver then processes all the substances in the blood.</p>

<p>There are dozen of enzymes in the liver which processes the substances in the blood. One enzyme family particularly processes all the foreign substances (inc. drugs) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wikipedia)</a>. Liver aims to remove all foreign substances from the blood, but some of the absorbed substance always escapes the liver to the systemic circulation. Only those molecules which escape liver without processing are transported to the tissues and afterwards can bind to their receptors in the tissue thus eliciting the proposed actions (ie. reducing pain).</p>

<p>Enzymes in the liver processes the foreign molecules in a way that they are secreted to bile and eventually to feces. For example enzyme CYP2E1 processes paracetamol <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wikipedia)</a>. There are three different CYP-enzymes which processes diclofenac molecules <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871048"" rel=""nofollow"">(PubMed)</a>. And for naproxen two CYP-enzymes exist <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8866821"" rel=""nofollow"">(PubMed)</a>. </p>

<p>One major reason why diclofenac does not help you but naproxen does, is the different action of these enzymes. DNA in our cell nucleus defines how each protein is expressed in our body. These enzymes are these proteins. In your case it seems that enzymes responsible for processing diclofenac are expressed in large number in your liver, resulting to very low concentration of diclofenac molecules in your bloodstream. In other word the level of diclofenac in your blood stream is out of therapeutic window to elicit any responses in the body <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window"" rel=""nofollow"">(Wikipedia)</a>. In contrary, your liver may express enzymes responsible for the processing of naproxen very little and thus many naproxen molecules may escape liver to the systematic circulation resulting the therapeutic level to elicit tissue responses.</p>

<p>This only one player in this topic, although very important and influential. There are also factor influencing after the first pass effect (receptor, expression of genes responsible for receptors, binding affinity ec.) </p>

"Why is thalidomide a current drug on the market?","140","","<p>Given the thalidomide birth defect disaster of the 1960s, why was it later approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of leprosy (1996) and of multiple myeloma (2006)? Presumably, the teratogenic issues and problems with permanent nerve damage didn't go away, as the liver can convert the ""good"" enantiomer to the ""bad."" Thalidomide affects even non-pregnant women, so why approve a drug with known severe complications?</p>
","<p><strong>Because leprosy and multiple myeloma are conditions for which other treatment options are limited.</strong></p>

<p>All treatments have side effects, some more debilitating than others. The trick with pharmacology is to balance the benefit of treatment with the hazards of the side effects.</p>

<p>Take cancer chemotherapy. The drugs we use for cancer chemotherapy are <em>horrible</em> poisons. We literally use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_mustard"" rel=""noreferrer"">derivatives of chemical weapons</a> to treat cancer. Why do we deliberately poison cancer patients with what amounts to a weapon of mass destruction? Because if we don't, the cancer will kill them. </p>

<p>In pharmacology there's a concept of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"" rel=""noreferrer"">therapeutic window</a>. That is, there's a particular amount of compound that will cause death or other severe disability. There's another (hopefully lower) level of the compound that will effectively treat the disease. In treating, we hope to hit that middle ground: enough to treat the disease, but not enough to kill the patient.</p>

<p>Different drugs have different therapeutic window. The window for over-the-counter drugs like asprin is rather large: the amount needed for severe side effects is many times higher than what people take to treat headaches. That's why we can allow untrained people to self-dose. (Though look at acetaminophen/paracetamol as an over-the-counter example where the window is not as large as it probably should be.) </p>

<p>In contrast, the threaputic window for many chemotherapy drugs is rather narrow. To make sure we hit that window, they're typically dosed by licensed professionals in a very controlled environment.</p>

<p>Back to thalidomide. The side effects of thalidomide are pretty severe. But to some extent they're controllable. If you scrupulously avoid exposing pregnant women or women who may become pregnant to thalidomide, you can avoid the teratogenic consequences. For the other consequences, you're back to the theraputic window: you want to hit a level of drug that is effective in treating the disease, but minimizes side effects.</p>

<p>That's why thalidomide has been approved. It's a cost/benefit analysis. The approving authorities took a look at the hazards of leaving leprosy and multiple myeloma untreated (or treated with other methods) versus the hazards from exposure to thalidomide. On the whole, they felt that the risks of thalidomide could be mitigated enough that it was the ""lesser evil"" than leaving the diseases untreated.</p>

<p>That said, if someone came out with a wonder drug that was as effective as thalidomide in treating these diseases but had fewer (or more benign) side effects, doctors would drop thalidomide like a hot potato, and the FDA might even revoke its approval. (Similar arguments hold for other potentially hazardous drugs like the nitrogen mustard chemotherapeutics.)</p>

<p>Several years ago, a scholarly report was published.

<h1>The advice given</h1>

<p>The report advises:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whenever you do laundry, add some <strong>activated oxygen bleach (AOB)</strong>.

<ul>
<li>Notes: You can use standalone AOB, or a detergent with AOB included. This is available in most supermarkets, but you have to know what to look for. See <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12053/if-you-have-fungus-e-g-athletes-foot-its-wise-to-add-activated-oxygen-blea"">this link</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If possible, also do laundry at <strong>140 °F (60 °C)</strong>.

<li>Note: This may shrink and/or destroy certain items. <a href=""https://www.sudsuplaundry.com/understanding-laundry-temperatures-know/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a> Read their care labels.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the <strong>regular cycle</strong>. Don't enable ""quick wash"", ""water saving"", or any other environmentally-friendly options.</li>
<li>Make sure each item goes through the rinse and spin cycles <strong>at least twice</strong>. Preferably three times.</li>
<li>It's best to wash items belonging to the infected family member in <strong>separate loads</strong> from everyone else's laundry.</li>
<li>If you can also dry the items in <strong>sunlight</strong>, this is an extra bonus.</li>
<li>The report also gives <strong>other advice</strong>; please see <a href=""https://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/system/files_force/publications/Effectiveness_of_laundering_IFHreport_21102013.pdf#page=52"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</li>

<h1>Water temperature</h1>

<p>In some countries (including the US and certain others), if you want to wash clothing at 140 °F (60 °C), there's a problem.</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://bottomlineinc.com/laundry-error-to-blame-for-persistent-athletes-foot-and-toenail-fungus/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> on the Bottom Line Inc. website states that, in these countries,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>household water heaters typically are set to 120 °F [50 °C] to minimize the risk of scalding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article suggests three possible workarounds.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One (<strong>dangerous</strong>) workaround would be to raise your water heater's temperature to 140 °F (60 °C). But this is a dangerously-high setting. <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/03/28/175584883/many-hot-water-heaters-set-too-high-upping-burn-risk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a> It may also be illegal in your jurisdiction. <a href=""http://inspectapedia.com/plumbing/Hot_Water_Temperature_Laws.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a> Water at 120 °F (50 °C) takes 5-10 minutes to cause a third-degree burn; but water at 140 °F (60 °C) takes just 3-5 seconds. <a href=""http://www.terrylove.com/forums/index.php?threads/honeywell-am-1-thermostatic-mixing-valves-water-heater-tempering.45651/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a> Third-degree burns sometimes kill people. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/28j9zp/eli5_why_when_someone_is_badly_burnt_do_they_die/cibgrh9/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source.)</a> Maybe I should email the Bottom Line Inc. and suggest that they revise their article.</p></li>
<li><p>Another workaround might be to pour a <strong>kettleful of boiling water</strong> into your top-loading washer shortly before it's finished filling.</p></li>
<li><p>A third workaround is to use a washing machine with a <strong>water-temperature-boosting feature</strong>, ""such as the Whirlpool Front-Load Washer with Deep-Clean Steam, model #WFW86HEBW, which can get the water up to 150 °F [65 °C]"".</p></li>

"Can the milk of a breastfeeding mother taking Ibuprofen make a baby sleepy?","138","","<p>I read some facts that Ibuprofen is safe to take during breastfeeding as it transfers in very little amount into the breast milk. Can the milk of a mother  taking motrin/advil or some other ibuprofen make a baby sleepy?</p>
","<p>As a general rule of thumb this concern for safe lactating (breast feeding) is of course entirely legitimate:
<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2015.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nonpharmacological approaches are always first-line treatment, and should also be used to complement any required drug treatment.</a> </p>

<p>And the connection of ibuprofen and sleepiness may not be unfounded either:
""<a href=""https://www.drugs.com/sfx/ibuprofen-side-effects.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unusual tiredness or weakness, sleepiness or unusual drowsiness (rare), and extreme fatigue (rare)</a>"" <em>are</em> listed as possible side effect of ibuprofen.</p>

<p>This sounds scary unless one takes into account that these effects are listed as rare and: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02735557"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">As weak acids, NSAIDs [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] are excreted in small amounts into human breast milk with little risk for adverse effects in the suckling infant.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get some hard numbers on this one might considers these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002937884901959"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Concentrations of ibuprofen in breast milk and serum were compared in 12 patients who had ingested one 400 mg tablet of ibuprofen every 6 hours over a 24-hour period for relief of post-cesarean section pain. Samples of breast milk and blood were obtained simultaneously over a 34-hour period beginning just prior to the first dose of ibuprofen. Gas-liquid chromatography assay methodology capable of detecting 1 μg/ml was used to determine concentrations of ibuprofen in serum and breast milk. Ibuprofen was present in the serum with a half-life of approximately 1.5 hours. No measurable amounts of ibuprofen were found in the samples of breast milk. <strong>The conclusion drawn is that, in lactating women who take up to 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours, less than 1 mg of ibuprofen per day is excreted in breast milk.</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And reach the following conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~MxKkGI:1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Because of its extremely low levels in breastmilk, short half-life and safe use in infants in doses much higher than those excreted in breastmilk, ibuprofen is a preferred choice as an analgesic or antiinflammatory agent in nursing mothers.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These conclusions are in generalised form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217187"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to our review, AMDs [anti-migraine drugs] safe during breastfeeding are as follows: low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ibuprofen, sumatriptan, metoprolol, propranolol, verapamil, amitriptyline, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, acetaminophen, caffeine, and metoclopramide. AMDs compatible with breastfeeding but warranting caution are as follows: diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, most new triptans, topiramate, valproate, venlafaxine, and cyproheptadine. Finally, high-dose ASA, atenolol, nadolol, cinnarizine, flunarizine, ergotamine, methysergide, and pizotifen are contraindicated.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what now about the sleepy baby at hand? Babies are just sleepy in general and after feeding especially:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><a href=""http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/breastfeed-sleep.html#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""> My baby falls asleep while nursing. What can I do?<br>
  Newborns often fall asleep at the breast, especially after feeling satisfied from a good feeding.</a> </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely normal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a553835/sleep-and-breastfeeding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Breastfeeding and sleep often overlap in the early weeks, when your baby spends more time asleep than awake. Dozing off mid-feed and waking for more milk a short time later is normal for newborns.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this period will pass:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://breastfeedingusa.org/content/article/what-about-sleepy-baby"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Each baby is unique. While some mothers worry that their baby isn’t sleeping regularly enough during the early weeks and months, you may have concerns that your baby is too sleepy. Experience has shown, however, that most babies develop more of an established sleep pattern after the newborn period. Enjoy this special time with your baby.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taken together this should read as: minimising drug intake is always a good idea, a sleepy baby is probably not a reason of big concern. If the infant seems highly unusual it is presumably still a good idea to present the case to a doctor.</p>

"Is high fructose corn syrup bad for you?","138","","<p>There are a lot of conflicting messages on high fructose corn syrup. In popular media, it is frequently demonized as a hidden danger or silent killer that should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://drhyman.com/blog/2011/05/13/5-reasons-high-fructose-corn-syrup-will-kill-you/"">5 Reasons Why High Fructose Corn Syrup Will Kill You</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When used in moderation it is a major cause of heart disease, obesity, cancer, dementia, liver failure, tooth decay, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you'd expect, the corn industry argues otherwise and says HCFS is as safe as table sugar. Besides industry responses, though, there are some studies that found little ill effects, such as this one: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991323/"">Health implications of fructose consumption: A review of recent data</a>, Rizkalla SW (2010).</p>

<p>Is there enough high-quality evidence to determine if high fructose corn syrup is, in fact, dangerous?</p>
","<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term ""high fructose corn syrup"" is not a good descriptor of its
  composition, but the term was mandated to distinguish the newly
  developed fructose-containing corn syrup from traditional all-glucose
  corn syrups. Factors that may account for the different effects of
  fructose alone or a mixture of fructose and glucose could be its
  gastrointestinal effects and absorption characteristics. (5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>Today we have too much access to energy that we don't need. This leads to the problem of obesity when people consume too many calories, pointing towards higher risks of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p><strong>The Possible Culprit</strong></p>

<p>High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) contributes to this problem because when consumed, it does not stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. In animal models, it even induces insulin resistance, leading to diabetes (1).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""the long-term consumption of diets high in fat and fructose is likely
  to lead to increased energy intake, weight gain, and obesity"" (1).</p>
  
  <p>Additionally, when ingested by itself, fructose is poorly absorbed
  from the gastrointestinal tract, and it is almost entirely cleared by
  the liver since it's absorbed through a different system than glucose.
  This puts more work on the liver. (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, HFCS </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""did not suppress circulating ghrelin, a major appetite-stimulating
  hormone"" - (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even though you're taking in a massive amount of energy and overworking your liver, you don't feel full, which causes you to keep eating and drinking.</p>

<p>For runners and other endurance athletes, this is ideal. They can store up massive amounts of energy without the need to stuff themselves until their stomachs are nearly exploding. For people who burn a massive amount of energy on a regular basis, HFCS comes as a good source for replenishing and preparing that energy for usage, but for everyone else who doesn't burn high levels of calories, this indicates a high influx of potential energy without anywhere to go. </p>

<p><strong>The Counter</strong></p>

<p>This short-term study notes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There were no differences in energy or macronutrient intake on day 2.
  The only appetite variable that differed between sweeteners was desire
  to eat"" (4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another study notes that most of the testing has been done on rats, whereas in humans, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for people with insulin resistance, diets
  with 50 grams or more per day (high consumption) may result in
  elevated triglycerides, but there is no effect with normal levels of
  fructose consumption. (5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Caution</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fructose is poorly absorbed from the digestive tract when it is
  consumed alone, but absorption improves when fructose is consumed in
  combination with glucose and amino acids. In addition, the principal
  sweetener in soft drinks in the US, HFCS, is not pure fructose but a
  mixture of fructose (55%) and glucose (45%). HFCS is predominately
  present as HFCS-55 (55% fructose, 41% glucose, and 4% glucose
  polymers) or HFCS-42 (42% fructose, 53% glucose and 5% glucose
  polymers) (5).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studies on humans hasn't been substantial enough to develop hard evidence. In fact, one of the studies indicates that fructose increased appetites while another claimed it inhibited appetite! </p>

<p>If there's one thing that seems highly possible right now, it's that high fructose corn syrup gives energy, whether you need it or not. Since most people don't, that contributes to possible obesity (3).</p>

"What are the dangers of screening tests in overdiagnosis and overtreatment?","138","","<p>I have recently seen a number of articles in the lay public print on overdiagnosis, for example in the New York Times, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/health/study-warns-against-overdiagnosis-of-thyroid-cancer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Study Points to Overdiagnosis of Thyroid Cancer</a>.</p>

<p>In the article, they state that while the thyroid cancer rate in the United States has more than doubled since 1994, in South Korea, it has increased fifteenfold in the past two decades. As stated in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although more and more small thyroid cancers are being found, however, <em>the death rate has remained rock steady</em>, and low. If early detection were saving lives, death rates should have come down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a bit confusing to think of ""overdiagnosing"" cancer. Sloan-Kettering in New York obviously agrees, as they now offer patients with small thyroid tumors the option to wait and see if the tumor grows, but so far, not many patients have chosen this option.</p>

<p>This seems to imply in the US at least (and even more so in South Korea), there is too much screening and too much treatment occurring.</p>

<p>What is overdiagnosis? What is overtreatment? Should the average person  stop getting screened? Isn't screening a good thing?</p>
","<p>Overdiagnosis is not the same as misdiagnosis (for example, many people are concerned that ADHD is often misdiagnosed, but call it <em>overdiagnosis</em>.*) </p>

<p>Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are intertwined. Diagnostic tests are considered ""useful"" if treatment decisions are affected by the results. Although it is extremely difficult to assess when overdiagnosis has occurred in an <em>individual</em>, it is relatively easy to assess when over diagnosis has occurred in a population. Rapidly rising rates of testing and disease diagnosis in the setting of stable death rates are suggestive of overdiagnosis.</p>

<p>There is some debate about how to best describe the problem, but narrowly defined, overdiagnosis can occur in at least three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>when screening tests become increasingly sensitive, identifying abnormalities that are minor, non-progressive, or likely to resolve on their own</p></li>
<li><p>when the definition of a disease changes such that conditions formerly to be thought ""compatible with normal"" are now classified as disease identifying as ""at risk"" people who will never suffer ill-effects from their condition</p></li>
<li><p>when tests performed unnecessarily show an abnormality for which the threshold of ""normal"" is unknown</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Having a <strong>diagnosis</strong> makes well people think they're ill (overdiagnosis). If they are then treated for this overdiagnosis, they are <strong>overtreated.</strong></p>

<p>An example of the first is in the newer, more sensitive tests for screening for thyroid cancer discussed in the NYT article. The overtreatment in this case is the unnecessary surgery (and complications thereof) because of the diagnosis.</p>

<p>An example involving changing definitions pertains to diabetes. When the official definition of diabetes changed from having a fasting blood sugar (FBS) of ""X or greater"" to an FBS of ""(X-y) or greater"" (a bit oversimplified, but still a good example), 1.6 million new diabetics were instantly <em>diagnosed</em>, some of whom are not likely to ever develop symptoms and complications and are not likely to benefit from treatment. </p>

<p>An example involving tests performed unnecessarily would be getting a head CT scan on a young, healthy person for a single seizure which could easily be explained by circumstance (e.g. being supported in an upright position during a feint), and finding an unrelated (and, say, benign) lesion, which someone then wants to biopsy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...[We] are in the midst of an <strong>epidemic of diagnosis</strong>. Conventional wisdom tells us that finding problems early saves lives because we have the opportunity to fix the problems early. [That t]here is no risk in finding things early. The truth is that early diagnosis is a double-edged sword; while it has the potential to help some, it has a potential to harm us. Such <em>overdiagnosis</em> leads to <em>overtreatment</em> when these “pseudo-diseases” are conventionally managed and treated as if they were real abnormalities; because these findings have a benign prognosis, treatment can only do harm. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prostate cancer is the poster child for overdiagnosis. Until we started widely screening for it with the prostate-specific antigen test, it was considered a disease with a uniformly bad prognosis. Only once screening (and treatment of detected tumors) was well underway did it come to light that the majority of prostate cancers detected by screening are clinically unimportant.  </p>

<p>Overdiagnosis should not be confused with false-positive results, that is, a positive test in an individual who is subsequently recognized not to have cancer. By contrast, an overdiagnosed patient has a tumor that fulfills the pathological criteria for cancer. Studies now estimate that 1 in 2 prostate cancers, 1 in 3 breast cancers, and 1 in 5 lung cancers are most likely overdiagnosed.</p>

<p>The impact of false-positive test results is largely transitory, but the impact of overdiagnosis can be life-long and affects patients’ sense of well-being and their ability to get health insurance; overtreatment impacts their physical health, and even their life expectancy.</p>

<p>What can be done? Resistance to overdiagnosis needs to be multi-pronged. The medical community, through testing and experience, needs to raise the threshold to label a test as “abnormal” or raise the threshold to intervene. (This has been done with the Prostate Specific Antigen test for prostate cancer.)</p>

<p>The other is harder. Many doctors believe patients can't make informed decisions in this area. However, studies (with women who've been diagnosed with breast cancer detected on screening) have shown that patients can make good decisions when presented with the appropriate facts.</p>

<p>When your doctor recommends <strong>screening</strong> for a particular cancer because of age or other demographic factors (e.g. you're a smoker), <strong>ask</strong>. Ask how you're likely to benefit from the test if it comes back positive, ask if there is any controversy about the screening test, ask if there are hand-outs explaining the risks and benefits of the screening test. </p>

<p><sub>N.B. <strong>This does not pertain to all tests ordered by physicians.</strong> Not all screening tests are bad, and tests need to be done when you have symptoms.<sub>  </p>

<p><sub>Cancer overdiagnosis may have of one of two explanations: 1) The cancer never progresses (or, in fact, regresses) or 2) the cancer progresses slowly enough that the patient dies of other causes before the cancer becomes symptomatic. Note that this second explanation incorporates the interaction of three variables: the cancer size at detection, its growth rate, and the patient’s competing risks for mortality. Thus, even a rapidly growing cancer may still represent overdiagnosis if detected when it is very small or in a patient with limited life expectancy.</sub>  </p>

"Do all hand sanitizers contribute to antibacterial resistance?","137","","<p>Some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizer"">hand sanitizers</a> contain triclosan to kill bacteria. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16922622"">Triclosan has been found</a> to contribute to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance"">antibacterial resistance</a>.</p>

<p>I'm trying to reduce my use of products that contribute to antibacterial resistance, but hand sanitizers are convenient when hand washing is unavailable. If I switch to a hand sanitizer with Isopropyl alcohol, will that still effectively kill germs without contributing to antibacterial resistance?</p>
","<p>The safest hand sanitizer from the perspective of reducing antibiotic resistance is the alcohol-based sanitizer. It's effective against a wide variety of microorganisms. </p>

<p>Remember, though, that hand sanitizers don't remove dirt and chemicals from your skin, and all of the ingredients in hand sanitizers are left to fully absorb into your skin. Alcohol makes the skin a bit more permeable to chemicals, so the current recommendation in hospital workers is to wash with soap and water after a few uses of hand sanitizer. (See the first reference for the rest of us.)</p>

<p>Hand sanitizers should primarily be used only as an optional follow-up to traditional hand washing with soap and water, except in situations where soap and water are not available. In those instances, use of an alcohol-based sanitizer is better than nothing at all. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer are about equal in their ability to remove or kill germs on hands, shown in many studies including one small one involving influenza:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hand hygiene with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub is highly effective in reducing influenza A virus on human hands, although soap and water is the most effective intervention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Soap and water eliminated more virus than the three alcohol-based hand rubs, although the difference between these strategies was not great.</p>

<p>While in theory this remains possible, research so far has not found evidence that use of triclosan leads to bacterial resistance. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The [FDA] said there is no evidence to date suggesting that triclosan is hazardous to humans, but several studies have found that triclosan can contribute to the development of bacterial resistance (Aiello AE et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2007;45[suppl 2]:S137-S147). In addition, animal studies have found that the chemical can interfere with thyroid function (Paul KB et al. Toxicol Sci. 2010;113[2]:367-379). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pediatricians are recommending that it be avoided in homes with children. It has become almost ubiquitous in the environment, so it should probably be avoided in hand-cleansers, as most of it ends up not on out hands, but in our water supply, etc.</p>

<p>The evidence is a only a bit clearer for quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride) because of a bacterial genetic element called an <em>integron</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent decades, various genetic mechanisms involved in the spread of resistance genes among bacteria have been identified. Integrons – genetic elements that acquire, exchange, and express genes embedded within gene cassettes (GC) – are one of these mechanisms. ...Initially studied mainly in the clinical setting for their involvement in antibiotic resistance, their role in the environment is now an increasing focus of attention. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is some evidence that QAC's may cause a selection pressure for bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance integrons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Class 1 integrons are genetic elements that carry antibiotic and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes that confer resistance to detergents and biocides. ...We show that prevalence of class 1 integrons is higher in bacteria exposed to detergents and/or antibiotic residues...</p>
  
  <p>Resistance toward QACs is widespread among a diverse range of microorganisms... Development of resistance in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria has been related to application in human medicine and the food industry. QACs in cosmetic products will inevitably come into intimate contact with the skin or mucosal linings in the mouth and thus are likely to add to the selection pressure toward more QAC-resistant microorganisms among the skin or mouth flora.</p>

"Why doctors have different opinions and diagnosis for the same patient?","137","","<p>I really wonder why different doctors have different opinions or diagnosis!! I've experienced many situations. For example: I went to ten doctors to see what's wrong with my eye, Some of them said I'm OK. Some said its very dangerous and I should take specific medicines. Also, When I measure my blood pressure I get different results from different doctors within the same hour. Once, I nerves doctor said I've a serious disease and I should take Syringe immediately while another doctor said that I don't have this disease at all. My parents and grandparents tell me about situations like that. I just would like to figure out why there are great variations in doctors opinions?</p>

<p>As an electrical engineer, I can say devices in general can have error and It can produce unclear and sometimes wrong information. Is that the reason?</p>

<p>I live in Egypt where education is not good. Do not doctors know how to use these devices and how to treat people?</p>

<p>Are doctors make exaggerate to earn more money?</p>

<p>I just would like to know the real reason to be careful and to know how to behave.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>
","<p>People are more complicated than machines. First, imagine a condition like ""high blood pressure"" or ""underactive thyroid."" It's not just a case of measuring one number about you and comparing it to one ""correct"" number. There is a normal <strong>range</strong> for healthy people. Imagine some measurement that for normal people is between 10 and 12. Imagine that you genuinely have a shortfall in this number; and you vary between 8 and 10. One doctor sees you on the day you measure 10 and tells you that you're fine. Another doctor sees you on the day you measure 8 and tells you there is a shortfall. So that's one explanation.</p>

<p>But life is actually more complicated than that. Some doctors might think 9-13 is actually normal for that number, so if you measure 9 they'll say you're fine. Others might think that it depends on some other reading, so if you measure 10 but the other number is low, they'll say you're ill, while another will insist that a reading of 10 means you're fine.  And doctors vary on how urgent they think certain conditions are: some think they can advise you to change your diet or to exercise, while others want to start you on medications, even when they both agree you have a particular condition.</p>

<p>Then on top of all of that there's the matter of how the doctors get paid. Some want to recommend particular treatments or tests as much to ensure an income for themselves as to actually fix you. We of course all hope that such people are few and far between, but they do exist, and you may have met a few of them in your time, or your relatives may have.</p>

<p>How should you behave? You have two choices. One is to focus on your symptoms: you're tired, or your eye hurts, or whatever, and ask your doctor to help you learn why and help you fix that so you feel better. If they do a measurement and say that it's fine, you ask them to do some other measurement or test so that they can suggest things to do that will help with your symptom. The other approach is to learn more about the condition you think you may have. Say you think you have high blood pressure. Learn what a normal range for each number is. When your doctor measures yours, ask what the measurement was. Learn the things you can do - how you sit, for example, that can affect the measurement. Ask the doctor's conclusion about the measurement - is it high? is it fine? - and if your conclusion is different, ask why. Why is that high? Don't people normally vary between x and y over the course of a day? Or why is that fine? Learn some of the thought processes your doctor is going through.</p>

<p>Getting a second opinion is a fine strategy. But ""Dr A says I need a medication and Dr B says I do not"" is nowhere near as valuable as ""Dr A measured 8 and says normal is 10-12 so I need this medication to raise it, but Dr B measured 10 and says normal is 9-13 so I don't.""  You can now go and learn more about what a normal range is, the consequences of being low, the side effects of the medication, and so on, then make an informed decision, including which doctor you want to work with over time to maintain your health. </p>

"Why might lab test results be normal when thyroid nodules are present and there are symptoms of hyperthyroidism?","137","","<p>By ultrasound there are many nodules in Thyroid gland but all thyroid tests (TSH,T4,T3, microsomal and thyreoglobulin antibodies) are within normal range but there is clear heperthyroidism signs like hair thinning,anxiety,irritability,cardio neurosis,fatigue etc. Why lab tests don't show any disfunction? What is the cause of these overactive thyroid signs? </p>
","<p>This constellation may result from at least five reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hypothesis #0: Both conditions (thyroid nodules and symptoms of
hyperthyroidism) are independent. Hyperthyroid symptoms including
anxiety, hair loss, fatigue and palpitations are unspecific.
Although they are typical for thyrotoxicosis, they may also result
from other conditions, e.g. masked depression or pheochromocytoma.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis #1: The nodules represent fully compensated toxic
adenomas, where somatic mutations lead to constitutive activation of
TSH signaling. Since autonomic production is fully compensated,
concentrations of thyroid hormones remain within their respective
reference ranges. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis result from deviation
of free T4 concentrations from the personal set point of thyroid
homeostasis. It is well known that the intra-individual variation of
TSH and free T4 concentrations is much smaller than inter-individual
variance (see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889165</a> and
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567792</a> ). This is a consequence
of an individual set point of the pituitary-thyroid feedback control
mechanism, which is encoded as TRH signaling from the hypothalamus.
Deviations of thyroid hormones within the reference range may still
lead to symptoms if they are far from the personal set point. See
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635726"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635726</a> for a review article

reconstructing the personal set point.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis #2: This is somewhat similar to hypotheses #1. The
nodules represent fully compensated toxic adenomas (like in
hypothesis #1), but they predominantly produce T3, which results
from intracellular hyperdeiodination (ensuing from constitutive
activation of TSH signaling and consecutive stimulation of the
distal part of the TSH-T3 shunt). T3 concentrations remain within
their reference ranges, but are above the range of concentrations
that are appropriate for the personal receptor sensitivity. See
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23339744/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23339744/</a> for a discussion of
this topic. It may be helpful to calculate the sum activity of
peripheral deiodinases (SPINA-GD), see also
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375554</a> for a methodological
overview.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis #3: The thyroid nodules produce non-classical thyroid
hormones (e.g. 3,5-T2, a highly active T4 metabolite), which
destabilize the heart rhythm and exert other symptoms of
hyperthyroidism. This is an understudied topic. One of the few
papers discussing this condition is
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279999"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279999</a> .</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis #4: T3 is secreted episodically from thyroid nodules, so
that it is missed from diagnostic work-up. This is also an
understudied topic. See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2045066"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2045066</a>
for more details.</p></li>

<p>It may be beneficial to determine concentrations of free T3 and free T4 (rather than total T3 and total T4) in order to avoid false negative results due to low plasma protein binding.</p>

<p>So what would be used to measure what and how?</p>
","<p>The absolute key to know if <strong>ANY</strong> treatment is working would be to find out that things get better after such treatment started, in this particular case, you want hair-loss to <strong>decelerate</strong>.  </p>

<p>In order to register a change, you need to first register the previous state of affairs, so you'd have to <strong>calculate</strong> hair-loss rate both before and after the treatment was started.<br>
<strong><em>First of all</em></strong> you wanna be sure it is actually a problem or if it isn't at all.<br>
If the rate of hair loss is not accelerating in a way that indicates some pathological problem, then there wouldn't be anything to worry about because humans normally lose some hair and grow some new.<br>
<strong><em>Otherwise</em></strong>, if the hair is falling in an accelerating manner and the amount of new hair does not correlate, then a diagnose of the <em>cause</em> and a treatment may be necessary.  </p>

<p>The <em>cause</em> is beyond the scope of this question so <strong>I'll stay on topic by elaborating on measurement and calculations</strong>.</p>

<p>This calculations shouldn't be done by means of human perception (e.g. photographs or simple observation) you want a method that's less fallible, there are other suggested ""practical"" methods like wearing a cap all day and then count the amount of hair that stays on the cap when you take the cap off and when you take a bath, this kind of methods are messy and there are multiple chances where mistakes can be made, so I'd say error-prone methods like this are useless. Not to mention, wearing a cap at all times is not practical and may even make things worse.  </p>

<p>I found some very interesting articles licensed under <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Creative Commons</a> in the National Library of Medicine.
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938572/"" rel=""nofollow"">The first one</a> describe a variety of methods, ranging from non-invasive to semi-invasive to invasive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Non-invasive methods</p>
  
  <p>e.g., Questionnaire, daily hair counts, standardized wash test, 60-s
  hair count, global photographs, dermoscopy, hair weight, contrasting
  felt examination, hair feathering test, phototrichogram and
  TrichoScan.</p>
  
  <p>Semi-invasive methods</p>
  
  <p>e.g., Trichogram and unit area trichogram (UAT).</p>
  
  <p>Invasive methods</p>
  
  <p>e.g., Scalp biopsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A scalp biopsy seems way to invasive and not suitable to be doing it frequently in order to calculate a rate of acceleration/deceleration, so I investigated further on the Thrichogram option; it turns that method has been used and approached from different angles <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2688520"" rel=""nofollow"">since the 80s</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This personal technical adaptation gives an easily obtainable definition of five <strong>quantitative parameters</strong> analysing the hair on a given area of the scalp: density of implantation, telogen percentage, growth rate, mean anagen diameter and percentage of fine hair less than 40 mu in diameter. In the normal male adult our measurements gave the following results on the vertex: density 204 +/- 10 hair per square centimeter, telogen percentage 17.8 +/- 2.8 p. 100, growth rate 0.35 +/- 0.03 mm p. day, mean anagen diameter 76 +/- 5 mu, percentage of fine hair 9.2 +/- 1.8</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there seems to have been <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681107/"" rel=""nofollow"">some progress recently</a> in the development of <strong><em>instruments</em></strong> to aid in such methods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To properly assess the progression and treatment response of alopecia, one must measure the changes in hair mass, which is influenced by both the density and diameter of hair. Unfortunately, a convenient device for hair mass evaluation had not been available to dermatologists until the recent introduction of the <strong><em>cross-section trichometer</em></strong>, which directly measures the cross-sectional area of an isolated bundle of hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article mentions one particular trademarked device but there must be others. So there you have it, I'll venture to state with some confidence that the best approach is to use some device like that one and measure your scalp at least one time a day. And for security sake and professionalism sake, I'd recommend some expert assistance from a dermatologist. But if you have a <strong>Scientific Mind and a Hacker Spirit</strong>, do it yourself, why not.<br>
(Just the measurement part, don't diagnose yourself.)</p>

<p>So in this particular case, if vitamins don't decelerate your hair loss rate, then to hell with vitamins, you may need something else, so go to a doctor and get properly diagnosed.</p>

"Why are two influenza vaccinations required for people under a certain age?","136","","<p>According to the CDC, people under 8 who have never had the flu vaccine or flu should get 2 doses at least 28 days apart. The reason given is that ""the first dose 'primes' the immune system,"" but as far as I know ""primes"" is not a medical term in this context.</p>

<p>What exactly does ""'primes' the immune system"" mean here? And what is the interaction between the first and second doses that provides immunity?</p>
","<p>It's just empirical data <em>suggesting</em> that the weaker <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">immune system</a> of young humans is typically not 'yet <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">finished</a>' reacting to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vaccine</a> with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">building</a> <em>enough</em> anti-bodys (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">and the rest</a>…) after just one <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flu shot</a>. Being ""primed"" might be perceived as a popularising phrase but it is not that far off either. One shot was observed to be not as effective in the past while two were apparently seen as similar effective as compared to shots for people older than children.</p>

<p>The relevant excerpt from the CDC for the upcoming season is really quite comprehensive and I cannot dump all the studies <em>they considered</em> in reaching this conclusion:

Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2016–17 Influenza Season</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Children aged ≥6 months typically develop protective levels of antibodies against specific influenza virus strains after receiving the recommended number of doses of seasonal IIV (101,105,131–134). Immunogenicity studies using the A(H1N1)pdm09 monovalent vaccine indicated that 80%–95% of vaccinated children developed protective antibody levels to the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus after 2 doses (135,136); response after 1 dose was 50% for children aged 6–35 months and 75% for those aged 3–9 years (137).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Studies involving seasonal IIV among young children have demonstrated that 2 vaccine doses provide better protection than 1 dose during the first season a child is vaccinated.</strong> In a study during the 2004–05 season of children aged 5–8 years who received IIV3 for the first time, the proportion of children with protective antibody responses was significantly higher after 2 doses than after 1 dose of IIV3 for each antigen (p = 0.001 for influenza A[H1N1]; p = 0.01 for influenza A[H3N2]; and p = 0 0.001 for influenza B) (138). <br> 
  <strong>Vaccine effectiveness is lower among children aged &lt;5 years who have never received influenza vaccine previously or who received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination than it is among children who received 2 doses in their first year of being vaccinated.</strong> <br><sub> A retrospective study of billing and registry data among children aged 6–21 months conducted during the 2003–04 season found that although receipt of 2 doses of IIV3 was protective against office visits for ILI, receipt of 1 dose was not (139). Another retrospective cohort study of children aged 6 months through 8 years, the majority of whom received IIV3 (0.8% received LAIV3), also conducted during the 2003–04 season, found no effectiveness against ILI among children who had received only 1 dose (140). In a case-control study of approximately 2,500 children aged 6–59 months conducted during the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, being fully vaccinated (having received the recommended number of doses) was associated with 57% effectiveness (95% CI = 28–74) against LCI for the 2004–05 season; a single dose was not significantly effective (too few children in the study population were fully vaccinated during the 2003–04 season to draw conclusions) (141). </sub> <br> The results of these studies support the recommendation that all children aged 6 months–8 years who are being vaccinated for the first time should receive 2 doses separated by at least 4 weeks.

<blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, during 2011–12 and 2012–13, vaccination with IIV3 reduced the risk of outpatient medical visits for ARI associated with influenza virus infection by about half. Vaccinations received in previous seasons had preventive value in subsequent seasons in the form of residual protection for those who missed vaccination in and priming which boosted the benefit of IIV. <strong>Most notably, children primed with 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the previous same season appeared to enjoy even greater preventive benefit from IIV3 and may have reduced their risk of A(H3N2) illness by two-thirds.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Immunization of previously unvaccinated children against influenza is thought to require two doses of vaccine. There is currently no general consensus regarding the age cut-off for a two-dose vaccination regimen. <strong>A second vaccine dose in previously unvaccinated children appears advisable because of the limited immunogenicity of a single dose of influenza vaccine in young children. […] These recommendations are based on the premise that a significant proportion of these children are immunologically na ̈ıve…</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone who was exposed to the antigens of the viruses develops some residual immunity. This limited immunity further weakens over time since the viruses change so much and so rapidly. Thus people might require 'an update' to these antibody information for the immune system based on the 'currently trending' virus strains. Young children have a weaker adaptive immune response and <em>presumably</em> no residual immunity. Both points are thought to be addressed by the two vaccination regimes.</p>

"What is the medical difference between physical and mental sleep?","134","","<p>Today I spent several hours doing hard, grueling, completely mindless physical labor. It's nowhere near my bedtime, but I'm physically exhausted, my back hurts, and all I really want to do is sit in bed until I go to sleep.</p>

<p>On other days, particularly at work, I do nothing but sit in a chair all day programming. I am not at that point physically tired, but I may become mentally tired due to the mental work I'm doing, stress of dealing with coworkers etc.</p>

<p>From this, I know that there appears to be a difference between the two types of exhaustion. One leads to me mindlessly walking around the office playing pokemon, and the other leads to me asking interesting questions on stack exchange sites that I've never been to before.</p>

<p>That being said (TL; DR)</p>

<p><strong>Is there a recognized medical difference between physical and mental exhaustion?</strong></p>
","<p>Mental fatigue:</p>

<p>Those who routinely obtain less than 7-9 hours of interrupted sleep per 24-hour period will have a high homeostatic drive for sleep as the body struggles to restore balance. In addition, scheduling inconsistencies often lead to a high circadian drive for sleep at exactly the wrong times of day as well as to sleep-initiation problems at night.</p>

<p>So, when athletes lose sleep due to any number of factors, when they’re unable to stick to a consistent bedtime due to travel or social engagements, and when they have to train or play at the “wrong” times in a new time zone, they’ll be faced with both a high homeostatic and a high circadian drive for sleep. The result will be impaired judgment, reaction time, and situational awareness—the hallmarks of poor mental effectiveness.</p>

<p>Physical fatigue:</p>

<p>Physical effectiveness, or energy, is different. It’s a function of non-sleep and circadian-related factors such as the type, intensity and volume of exercise (or physical labor) as well as muscle fiber composition, neuromuscular characteristics, high energy metabolite stores, buffering capacity, ionic regulation, capillarization, and mitochondrial density. Physical energy can be viewed as the capacity to perform a certain amount and intensity of physical activity for a given period of time. Elite athletes, who routinely engage in high-intensity training, are far less susceptible to physical fatigue than those who are sedentary. They run faster, lift more weight, and perform for longer periods of time due to their enhanced physical conditioning.</p>

<p>Naproxen EC/DR is prescription only, while the other is not.  I've googled the title of this question and didn't really find anything helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> My doctor has finally written a prescription for naproxen EC/PR for me. If nobody posts an answer to this in, say, a week, I'll post my own experience.</p>
","<p><em>Summary:</em> There are studies showing a difference in gastrointestinal problems and studies where no difference was observed. At least some of the effect it has on the stomach is not related to whether naproxen is released in the stomach or small intestine. </p>

<p>There are two very small studies here:</p>

<p>that concluded that the negative gastrointestinal effects were lessened in the coated form. However, they don't disappear, pointing towards there being both a systemic and local effect of naproxen for the stomach, independent of how it's delivered. </p>

<p>A slightly larger (though still small) study <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1185/03007999109111664"" rel=""noreferrer"">The efficacy and tolerability of enteric and non-enteric coated naproxen tablets: a double-blind study in patients with osteoarthritis</a> found no significant differences in either efficiency or tolerability, meaning that gastrointestinal problems appeared for both forms. </p>

  <p>[...] These studies indicated that EC­
  NAPROSYN and NAPROSYN showed no significant differences in efficacy 
  or safety and had similar prevalence of minor GI complaints. Individual 
  patients, however, may find one formulation preferable to the other. </p>
  
  <p>Five hundred and fifty-three patients received EC-NAPROSYN during long­
  term open-label trials (mean length of treatment was 159 days). The rates for 
  clinically-diagnosed peptic ulcers and GI bleeds were similar to what has been

","<p>Lowered brain activity in a PET scan isn't necessarily bad. It depends on what <em>part</em> of the brain is less active than usually and whether this is a <em>permanent</em> or <em>transient</em> state. Our brains are less active during sleep - that isn't a bad thing. </p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>Dry rice, when cooked with water, grows quite substantially. A single cup of dry rice might become 2-3 cups or more of cooked rice.</li>
<li>Alternatively, a single serving of cooked (and thus wilted) spinach is often sold in containers that require moving equipment to get out to my car.</li>
</ul>

<p>When reading nutrition tables and other statistics about food, should volumes be understood as pre-preparation, or post?  And is the answer standardized across all (or at least most) platforms and info sources, or does it change from place to place?</p>

<p><strong>If I cook 1 cup of dry rice with water and it becomes 3 cups of cooked rice, and I eat it all, did I just eat 1 cup of rice, or 3?</strong></p>
","<p>In the US, <a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.12"" rel=""nofollow"">21 CFR 101</a> provides reference amounts for serving sizes, which are usually followed somewhat closely (I wasn't able to determine if they are required by law) by food manufacturers.</p>

<p>In the specific case of rice, the standard serving size is ""140 g prepared; 45 g dry"" listed in the format ""_ cup(s) (_ g)"".</p>

<p>Usually, the nutritional label on the actual product package (no comment on databases on random websites and apps) will provide information about whether it is referring to prepared or ""raw"" state, or will provide both. The prepared state may include ingredients not provided in the package.</p>

<p>For example, Cheerios has a serving size of ""1 cup (28 g)"", dry, and additionally provides a column with values for ""with 1/2 cup skim milk"".</p>

<p>Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner gives the serving size as ""2.5 oz (70 g / about 1/2 box) (Makes about 1 cup)"", and provides columns for ""as packaged"" and ""as prepared"". Different pictures I found of the nutrition information and directions varied widely as to the calories of the ""as prepared"" column and the amount of butter called for; presumably these will match on any given box.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to find any pictures of real nutrition labels for packages of plain rice.</p>

<p>Google allows you to specify ""raw"" or ""cooked"" when searching for the nutrition information of rice - according to it, 100 grams of cooked long-grain brown rice has 111 calories, and 100 grams of raw long-grain brown rice has 370 calories. When the measure is switched to one cup, the calories are 216 and 684 respectively, with the weights being 195 and 185 grams. So, if your app doesn't say, it should be easy to figure out which numbers track better with how many calories it actually says a cup of rice has.</p>

"Why is it a bad idea to re-heat drinking water?","133","","<p>Out of laziness sometimes I re-heat the water in kettle we use to make formula milk for our daughter, but the health visitor said it's a bad practice to re-boil water over and over. Any specific reason for that? </p>
","<p>Water isn't pure H<sub>2</sub>O; there are all kinds of dissolved substances in it: minerals, chemicals, etc. This is why scientists use only distilled water in experiments (often twice-distilled).</p>

<p>Some impurities will boil off (some volatile organic compounds, for instance) but some will remain behind. With each boil, you lose some of the water to steam, leaving a more concentrated solution of those contaminants which do not boil off.</p>

<p>For example, add a teaspoon of salt to two cups of water; boil away one cup of water, and you'll be left with water that's almost twice as salty as you started with. (Some small amount of salt may be splashed out while boiling.)</p>

<p>This is why you should always start out with fresh water; otherwise you're feeding your daughter water which has more contaminants than fresh water. If you want to do that for yourself, that's your choice, but your baby deserves better.</p>

"How can one protect themselves from toxic substances released from fatty tissue during weight loss?","132","","<p>It is well-known that obesity is associated with many health risks and obese persons are advised to follow a healthy diet and increase physical activity to lose weight and improve their overall health.</p>

<p>However, adipose (fatty) tissue accumulates lipophilic toxic substances, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl"" rel=""nofollow"">poly chlorinated biphenyls</a> (PCBs) and other <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"" rel=""nofollow"">persistent organic pollutants</a> (POPs). <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11093288"" rel=""nofollow"">Studies</a> have shown that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Body weight loss increases plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in obese subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, the review on <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569688/pdf/ehp.1205485.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Toxicological Function of Adipose Tissue: Focus on Persistent Organic Pollutants</a> cites research to support the claim that plasma concentrations of POPs increase with weight loss, and cites animal studies which have shown that weight loss promotes POPs redistribution to other lipid rich tissues, such as the brain and the liver. This implies that losing weight, especially rapidly, could have toxic effects on the patient.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>If we stipulate that a person is losing weight <em>gradually</em>, are there any protective/precautionary measures they could take, to protect themselves from harmful effects of toxic substances stored in their adipose tissues, which are released on losing weight?</li>
<li>Is there a way to promote POPs excretion instead of redistribution, and how can this be achieved?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Alas, you cannot protect yourself from these toxic substances once they are in your body. Further, as currently phrased this question is awfully broad. We have managed to produce a gigantic amount of different harmful substances and covering them all in this answer is really not possible. Instead this answer tries to generalise about fat-soluble and long term stable materials that get liberated in weight loss. Any substance mentioned in citations is meant as one example, most examples do not generate generally applicable advice.</p>

<p>There are some options to consider to protect you from the harm these substances do. For obvious ethical reasons most of the following is based on experimental data <em>in vivo</em> and not nearly enough on human trials.</p>

<p>The good news is, these substances are generally very stable, but not indestructible. They do accumulate in fatty tissues and are hardly excreted or broken down. But eventually some of them are broken down or just excreted.</p>

  This study shows that PCB11 is completely absorbed after inhalation exposure and is rapidly eliminated from most tissues. Phase II metabolites dominated with a slower elimination rate than the PCB11 or phase I metabolites and thus can best serve as urine biomarkers of exposure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dynamics of POP release and damage are still investigated and indeed worrisome:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107350"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Dynamics of persistent organic pollutants in obese adolescents during weight loss:</strong></a></p>
  
  <p>In general, POP levels raised by 1–3.5% per kilogram weight loss. The increase in the POPs levels during weight loss did not affect the profile, which remained similar over time. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease the risk of weight-related health problems. However, the results of the present study indicate that the increase in the levels of POPs released in blood during weight loss might be of concern since literature suggested that they can be associated with endocrine disturbances. The clinical significance of the weight loss induced serum pollutants levels observed in the present study is, however, as yet unknown. Beneficial health effects of weight loss are generally expected, however, the increase in the internal exposure may adversely act on health since metabolism and/or elimination of POPs may be altered in adolescents as compared to adults. Further studies are therefore needed to address this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To minimise the damage they will do there are a few routes open, all of them weak and some of them based on preliminary results and reasonable speculation:</p>

<h2>Slow down their release</h2>

<p>Although it was already priced into the original question, the slower the weight loss the slower the release of persisten organic pollutants (POPs). The dosage makes the poison and therfore slowing the release of these unwanted materials is all the better.  </p>

<h2>Increase excretion and elimination</h2>

<p>As should be obvious highly lipophilic substances like those in question are not easily deposed of. But the body does eliminate them, very slowly, once they are mobilised from the fatty tissues.</p>

<p>That means drinking a lot helps, sweating a lot helps and loosing blood helps. Speeding up the metabolism, exercising or even going to a sauna seem quite beneficial. </p>

<p>The loosing blood needs special mention since it would be unethical to go donating blood if anyone does it to get rid of toxic substances. Yet it seems strange to advise blood-letting again, even when this involves a round of the venerable <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirudo_medicinalis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hirudo medicinalis</a> treatment. But once the substances are mobilised they are transported via blood to areas you want to to avoid them ending up. Extracting this contaminated blood is not the strangest of ideas then.</p>

  Conclusion. Blood testing provides only a partial understanding of human PBDE bioaccumulation; testing of both blood and perspiration provides a better understanding. This study provides important baseline evidence for regular induced perspiration as a potential means for therapeutic PBDE elimination. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the infamous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olestra"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Olestra</a> and its kind may have a role of value:</p>

<blockquote>

Further studies are needed to assess its efficiency in larger animals such as ruminants, where only nonabsorbable lipid supplementation in well-fed growing lambs or lactating cows and goats was tested. With regard to CLD, which accumulates in the liver rather than in AT, undernutrition seems not to represent a valuable strategy because of its probable deleterious effect on liver size and metabolic activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Limit the damage the substances can do</h2>

<p>There were a few theories proposed for certain mechanisms of action for these substances, one of them being endocrinal disrupters another being promoter of oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Especially the latter has received some attention and the old adage of food being your medicine came to life again.</p>

<p>While ""eat healthy"" seems like a no-brainer on this front it is currently the best practical advice available. These findings are very limited by their nature. Popular ""anti-oxidants"" have usually a very low bioavailability and even in those experimental settings used to study them in regard to POPs with scaffolding mechanisms their effectiveness was greater than zero, but still not very great.</p>

<p>Curcumin, resveratrol, CoQ10, NAC and just about all of the usual suspects for such a scenario showed some promise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28975503"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>The environmental pollutant, polychlorinated biphenyls,
  and cardiovascular disease: a potential target for antioxidant nanotherapeutics:</strong></a>
  A final consideration to be made in the use of antioxidant therapies is that of the route of administration. Given their size and use, most studies have focused upon i.v. injection of nanocarrier systems. Yet, such intervention strategies are likely to be limited to acute and subacute exposures, as prolonged i.v. administration is highly undesirable. As such, exploration of alternative delivery methods, includ- ing inhalation, intratracheal, intraperitoneal, and topical administration, is needed. All of these methods have been tried for the delivery of antioxidant in free form. Clinical trials employing oral delivery of antioxidants such as curcumin in free form have been conducted several times, with variable dosage towards suppression of oxidative stress-induced inflammation. […]<br>
  Chronic exposure of environmental pollutants remains a significant health concern. Even now, PCBs pose a contin- uous threat to the health and safety of our population. As a result, we need a wide array of tools and strategies to counteract these potential risks. While effective and healthful nutrition is likely to be a major player in our strategies to minimize health hazards, as seen by clinical trials of antioxidant interventions, it is unlikely that nutrition alone is enough to treat or prevent all PCB exposure-induced disorders. As such, strategies that can reduce body burden, enhance antioxidant delivery to target cells, and capture PCBs before entering the body can potentially be used to provide defense against PCB toxicity. Furthermore, we know from other treatments, such as NAC for acetamino- phen toxicity, where antioxidant therapy can be an effective antidote. In order to enhance antioxidant therapy, strategies for effectively delivering antioxidants, such as nanocarriers, are likely required. Further studies for ideal candidates will be needed to best assess which compounds will be most effective at countering the toxicity of co-planar and non-coplanar PCBs. Finally, while studies with injectable nanocarriers provide some promising results, such routes of administration are not likely acceptable for chronic delivery systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best treatment is of course preventing any new harmful material from entering your system. For that it might be worth considering decrease animal fat consumption:</p>

<p>Does this mean that essential oils are a good alternative to alcohol-based disinfectant products for everyday use?</p>
","<p>There are many essential oils and each can work differently and on different micro-organisms. They could affect the skin and mucous membranes in ways that are valuable or harmful.</p>

<p>For example steam-distilled <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_oil"" rel=""noreferrer"">eucalyptus oil</a></strong> is used as a primary cleaning/disinfecting agent added to soaped mop and countertop cleaning solutions, however there are hundreds of species of eucalyptus and dozens are used as sources of essential oils, so products of different species differ greatly in characteristics and effects and also the products of the very same tree can vary grossly<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil#Eucalyptus_oil"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some other <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15824699"" rel=""noreferrer"">studies</a> show that <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_tree_oil#Medical_use"" rel=""noreferrer"">tea tree oil</a></strong> is capable of killing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRSA"" rel=""noreferrer"">MRSA</a> in a laboratory setting, however there is insufficient evidence. A 2012 review by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIH"" rel=""noreferrer"">NIH</a> rates Tea tree oil as ""possibly effective"" for: treating acne, fungal toenail infection or symptoms of athlete's foot. Which indicates its antibacterial properties only against certain infection.</p>

<p>On the other hand some other essential oils generally should not be applied directly to the skin in their undiluted or ""neat"" form, as can cause potential danger such as severe irritation, provoke an allergic reaction and, over time, prove <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxic"" rel=""noreferrer"">hepatotoxic</a>. Some other, including many of the citrus peel oils, are photosensitizers, increasing the skin's vulnerability to sunlight.</p>

<p>In summary, <strong>non-therapeutic grade essential oils are never recommended for topical or internal use</strong> (including animals, which could cause extreme hepatotoxicity and dermal toxicity), unless specific essential oil has pharmaceutical properties and you know they're safe for use, however they're not good alternative to alcohol-based disinfectant products.</p>

  <p>Secondary outcome measures were use of rescue medications as recorded in a daily diary; withdrawal rates; occurrence of adverse events; and routine safety laboratory tests, including testing for glucose homoeostasis assessed by fasting glucose concentrations at yearly intervals in all patients still receiving the study treatment. </p>

  <p>Most patients reported at least one adverse event: 93% with placebo and 94% with glucosamine sulphate. There were no substantial differences between groups in frequency or pattern of events. </p>
  
  <p>In about half the cases, these events were referred to the gastrointestinal system (mainly including abdominal pain and disturbed defecaton) and may be also referred to the rescue medication, without differences between groups. </p>
  
  <p>Routine laboratory tests did not show any great abnormalities in system organs or metabolic functions in the two groups during the study. There was no change in glycaemic homoeostasis, with fasting plasma glucose concentrations decreasing slightly in the glucosamine sulphate group (data not shown). </p>

"What are the risks of vitiligo, and how should I keep myself safe?","131","","<p>I have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo"">vitiligo</a>, and have done for the last couple of years. I am not worried about how it looks, and I know about camouflage makeup - I chose not to use it.</p>

<p>I am concerned, however, about the risk of sunburn and possibly other illnesses caused by that (for example, some skin cancers).</p>

<p>I would like to know what extra precautions I have to take to keep myself safe - other than the basics that everyone does of suncream if it is sunny.</p>
","<p>There is no cure for vitiligo, but there are treatments that may reduce the discoloring in your skin and possibly  even restore skin color. The main treatments used by doctors are either restoring the skin to normal color, or bleaching the skin, so that all of the skin is an even color. They do these things in a number of ways, including topical treatments and some surgical treatments.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>There still might be some side-effects, though. Some people might suffer from psychological distress, but as you said, that doesn't affect you. There is also an increased risk for sunburn and even skin cancer when exposed to the sun. Vitiligo can also cause inflammation of the iris, causing you to have eye problems. There is also a chance of hearing problems. Lastly, as a side-effect of any treatments you might be receiving, you may get dry skin and feel itchy.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>To help prevent these side-effects (besides the last one) there are many things you can do other than getting treatments. The most important thing is to protect yourself from UV light. It is recommended that you use sunscreen with at least 30 SPF(Sun Protection Factor). Try to be in the shade whenever possible and wear clothing that will protect your skin from the sun (ie: long sleeve shirts, pants, hats, etc.). Covering up will help with most side-effects, especially the sunburn and the skin cancer, which you are a higher risk for than eye or hearing problems. Also, <strong>never</strong> get a tattoo. Getting a tattoo will cause more damage to your skin, which can make more patches of vitiligo to appear on your skin.<sup>3</sup></p>

"What forms of prevention of STIs are there?","131","","<p>Other than the condom, are there any other methods of preventing contracting STIs?</p>

<p>If so, do any of these also provide an effective form of contraception?</p>


","<p>The CDC lists two:  <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/brief.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">complete abstinence, and being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner</a>.</p>

<p>Sexual intercourse naturally introduces microtears (small tears in the the epithelial layer) through which diseases can transfer between partners.  One might think that additional lubrication would help with this, but <a href=""http://www.catie.ca/en/pif/spring-2011/research-update-are-lubes-safe-anal-sex"" rel=""noreferrer"">the jury is most definitely out on that.</a></p>

<p>I think it's pretty safe to say that if there was another clinically verified way of preventing STDs, the CDC would have put it on <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this list</a>.  (For example, they note that there are specific things you can be vaccinated against, namely hepatitis B and HPV.)  It strains credulity to think that there is a mechanism available that the CDC just forgot to mention there.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, I'll just mention the fact that there are a variety of types of condoms.  If you are in a situation where you need to use them (e.g. non abstinent and not in a long term monogamous relationship), you might be able to find a brand or type that works better for you.</p>

<p>EDIT:  A comment has pointed out that a cervical barrier method can reduce the risk of transmission of certain types of STIs.  Since that does not show up on the CDC list I mentioned, I feel that it's worth bringing up.  By no means is that a ""safe substitute"" for a condom (and I don't think anyone is implying that it is).  However, as a risk <em>reducer</em>, it should be added to the list.</p>

<p>•Very young or old age</p>

<p>•Pregnancy</p>

<p>Hereditary factors make some people more susceptible to the toxic effects of certain drugs. Certain diseases can alter drug absorption, metabolism, and elimination and the body's response to drugs, increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions.

"Pain after root canal treatment","130","","<p>Can there be pain in a tooth which has undergone root canal treatment about 3 years ago, due to breaking the crown of the tooth? </p>

<p>I would think that it should not, because the root nerve to the tooth is completely removed and has got nothing to do with crown breaking. Am I correct?</p>
","<p>Although a root canal removes the pulp from the tooth (and the nerve along with it), that doesn't make the tooth immune to infection and the resulting pain. If the tooth or crown is broken or cracked, that can provide a pathway for bacteria to reinfect the tissues beneath and surrounding the tooth, as shown in <a href=""http://www.aae.org/patients/treatments-and-procedures/endodontic-retreatment-explained.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the image below</a>:</p>

<p>As explained at the link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New decay can expose the root canal filling material to bacteria, causing a new infection in the tooth.</p>
  
  <p>A loose, cracked or broken crown or filling can expose the tooth to new infection.</p>
  
  <p>A tooth sustains a fracture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you might imagine, the new infection at the base of the tooth could cause pain since the nerves surrounding the tooth remain intact. Obviously, only a dentist or endodontist can tell you if this is what happened and how it should be treated. Loss of the tooth is possible, especially if you delay care.</p>

"Can honey help with diabetes?","129","","<p>Honey may increase the blood glucose level. However, it may also contains some ingredients that give relief for diabetic patients. Is this true?</p>
","<p>One of the main constituents present in honey that contributes largely in exhibiting antidiabetic effect is fructose. There is evidence that fructose tends to lower blood glucose levels in rodent models of diabetes.
Mechanisms responsible for this may include a prolongation
of gastric emptying time,reduced rate of intestinal absorption and reduced food intake. In addition to fructose, oligosaccharides such as palatinose (isomaltulose) present in honey have been reported to delay digestion and intestinal absorption of glucose resulting in reduced glycemia</p>

<p>Additionally, fructose has also been shown to stimulate glucokinase in hepatocytes which plays a significant role in the uptake and storage of glucose (as glycogen) by the liver.</p>

<p>Likewise, Honey contains a number of mineral elements such as zinc, selenium, copper, calcium, potassium, chromium, manganese and so on. Some of these minerals such as chromium are recognized for their role in the reduction of elevated blood glucose, maintenance of normal glucose tolerance and insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cells.</p>

<p>Honey as an antidiabetic agent is likely to be more effective and beneficial if combined with conventional antidiabetic therapy.  If combined with conventional antidiabetic drugs or insulin, the use of honey may necessitate lower doses of these synthetic drugs or insulin to achieve similar glycemic control.</p>

"Will I lose weight following this diet?","129","","<p><em>I am 24 years old female. Height 5.3"" and Weight 58kg.</em> </p>

<p>I want to reduce my weight especially belly and thigh fats. I have just changed my routine to make it possible but I am not sure this will work or not.</p>

<p>Here an overview of my day: I get up at 7.00 am in the morning and do some workout including rope skipping and some other exercises for 30 mn. Then I take a hard boiled egg. In the office, at 9.30 am I take a large cup of black coffee (without milk and sugar) with two hands full of nuts (cashew nuts, pistachio, walnut, and almond). During my break time, I take a bowl full of fruits (two peaches, two apples, 1 pear) at 4.00 pm I take another cup of black coffee. For dinner, I take half piece of roti (bread) with any vegetable or meat.</p>

<p><strong><em>Is this routine healthy in losing weight and will this lead to weight loss?</em></strong>  </p>
","<p>The common thought here is to lose weight you need to have more calories going out than coming in (basically, just eat less).</p>

<p>Your TDEE (number of calories you should eat per day to stop any weight change is <a href=""https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=metric&amp;g=female&amp;age=24&amp;kg=58&amp;cm=160&amp;act=1.375&amp;f=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">around the 1600 mark</a></p>

<p>Lets look at your diet, your exercise is not worth accounting for.</p>

<p>It looks a little like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/28Z59.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/28Z59.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>A quick analysis says that if you follow that diet exactly and not pile on sauce onto your dinner then you will lose weight as your calories out > calories in.</p>

<p><em>HOWEVER</em> You are cutting out protein and fats to lose weight which can work but is not optimal. Carbs, which make up most of your diet are not very ""filling"" </p>

<p>It's well established that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1558S.long"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">protein generally increases satiety to a greater extent than
  carbohydrate or fat and may facilitate a reduction in energy
  consumption</a> - <em>Protein, weight management, and satiety, Douglas
  Paddon-Jones, Eric Westman, Richard D Mattes, Robert R Wolfe, Arne
  Astrup, and Margriet Westerterp-Plantenga</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while your diet will work, you will probably feel more hungry than if you met your protein and fat intake and cut carbs.</p>

"Is it true that our earlobes and noses elongate because of gravity -- not necessareily cartilage growth?","128","","<p>I always thought and assumed it truth that earlobes and noses continued to grow because cartilage doesn't stop growing, but I've heard it's actually due to gravity. Which one is true? Or do both contribute? </p>
","<p>According to a common misconception, your ears keep growing because of the cartilage, which supposedly keeps growing your entire life. </p>

<p>In reality cartilage doesn’t keep growing in size your entire life, the real reason why our ears – and also our noses! – keep growing is the result of gravity, and a special kind of cartilage in your ears. In our body there are three different forms of cartilage; Hyaline, Elastic, and Fibrocartilage. The difference between the three types lies in the kind of protein fiber, their amount and the way it’s constructed. </p>

<p>Elastic cartilage and gravity are the reason why it seems our ears keep growing </p>

<p>The type of cartilage that can be found in our ear is the elastic variety. And as the name elastic cartilage already implies, its main component is elastic fibers – which give your ear more flexibility. As with all collagen and elastin fibers in our body, they begin to break down when we age. This is causing them to stretch and sag, making them appear longer.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the actual cause of our seemingly-swelling snout is gravity. When we age, the collagen and elastin fibers that make up cartilage begin to break down. This causes them to stretch and sag, making them appear longer. Our skin giving structural support to cartilage also contains collagen and elastin fibers that droop over time. This compounds the lengthening problem.</p>

"Water vs. Coffee when hungry at work","128","","<p>On occasion I will not have time to eat breakfast or forget to pack a snack before work. While sitting at my desk, I can hear my stomach rumbling and I have a higher tendency to daydream or lose focus on my work.</p>

<p>My only two options before lunchtime are to buy a <strong>coffee</strong> from the vending machine or to drink enough <strong>water</strong> to fill me up (in addition to the 700mL I usually drink in the morning). </p>

<p>Which of these options would <em>better for curbing hunger pangs and improving concentration</em>?</p>

<p>Note: obviously the solution to my problem is to be a real adult and make sure I have enough food, but I'm just curious about this.</p>
","<p><em>Short answer</em>:</p>

<h2>A pack of raisins.</h2>

<p>Yes, I've read your question through and through. Please, bear with me for a while, to see the <em>longer answer</em>:</p>

<p>The problem with concentration when you haven't eaten arises primarily because of the lack of nutrients, i.e. glucose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain, except during prolonged starvation. The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose. [...] Fatty acids do not serve as fuel for the brain, because they are bound to albumin in plasma and so do not traverse the blood-brain barrier. In starvation, ketone bodies generated by the liver partly replace glucose as fuel for the brain. (1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, you can't focus because <strong>your brain lacks fuel</strong>. It's somewhat similar to a car: yes, you can add water to the radiator (and need to), and yes you can add sparks to make your engine start, but without fuel it just won't run.</p>

<p><strong>Caffeine will not only fail to solve your problem, but can actually be harmful on an empty stomach.</strong> It can hurt both your stomach and can make you feel even less focused after a short while.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion. (2).</p>
  
  <p>Caffeine may increase an individual's sensitivity to hypoglycemia through the combined effects of reducing substrate delivery to the brain via constriction of the cerebral arteries, whilst simultaneously increasing brain glucose metabolism and augmenting catecholamine production. [...] Under laboratory conditions, acute ingestion of caffeine markedly enhances the symptomatic and sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia in both healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 diabetes. (3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum it up - caffeine will make you more alert for a short while, but it will eat up little fuel that you had left, and leave you almost completely without it. For the half hour, 40 minutes perhaps, you will feel better, but then the problems will start - even stronger sense of hunger, worse problems with focusing on your work and possibly light-headedness and hand trembling might occur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heartburn is the most frequently reported symptom after coffee drinking. It is demonstrated that coffee promotes gastro-oesophageal reflux. Coffee stimulates gastrin release and gastric acid secretion [...] Coffee induces cholecystokinin release and gallbladder contraction[...] (4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caffeine will stimulate the release of gastric acid and bile, which are meant to digest food. But, since there will be no food to digest it will begin to ""digest"" your stomach instead (well, not literally, but it can cause you pain and problems, especially if you make a regular practice of it).</p>

<p>Water might leave you feeling fuller for a while, but it won't solve the underlying problem (lack of brain fuel), and large quantities of water, drank in a relatively short time span, on an empty stomach, might leave some feeling a bit sick (the smaller the stomach volume, the worse it gets). It's not dangerous, but can be uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>The solutions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Do you ever forget your keys? Your mobile phone? Well <strong>make a habit of not forgetting your snacks.</strong> It is simply a matter of priorities, and health is a priority. (And do make sure that the snacks are as healthy as possible).</li>
<li>Have a contingency snack plan: keep a bag of raisins (e.g.) in your purse. If you change purses, keep a bag of raisins in every purse, or next to something that you won't forget (e.g. your keys).</li>
<li>Keep a pack of raisins (or something similar) at work (in your desk perhaps).</li>
</ol>

<p>For 2 and 3 - just remember to occasionally check those places and expire dates - no one likes to find a 10-month old bag of raisins in their purse/desk/key drawer.</p>

  eye fluid buildup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How to use Tea Bags for Dark Circles:</p>

<p>Soaked and cooled tea bags can be placed directly on dark circles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Process 1:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Steep 2 tea bags (green or white or black) in a glass of hot water    for few minutes.</li>
  <li>Squeeze the bags to remove any liquid.</li>
  <li>Place in a refrigerator for about 15 – 20 minutes to cool.</li>
  <li>Wash your face with cool water and pat the skin dry.</li>
  <li>Lie down and place the chilled tea bags on eyes.</li>
  <li>Leave for 15 – 20 minutes before removing.</li>
  <li>Rinse your face with cool water to reduce inflammation.</li>
  <li>Repeat 2 – 3 times daily.</li>
  <li>Or you can place the tea bags in cool water rather than the fridge    and use them directly.</li>
  <li>Alternately, place unused teabags in freezer and apply this on the    eyes.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Follow the above process for all tea bags. Here are the properties of different tea bags to know how effective they are to treat dark circles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Chamomile Tea Bag</strong> Chamomile tea has anti – oxidant, anti – allergenic, astringent, anti – inflammatory, bleaching, saturating and
  cleansing properties that lightens up the skin around the eyes and
  reduces fatigue. This is the only herbal tea bag you should use.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Green Tea Bag</strong> Green Tea is rich in antioxidants and tannins that help to lighten the dark circles. It also reduces the puffiness and
  swelling and tightens the skin around the eyes. It has an astringent
  nature that constricts the blood vessels and capillaries under the
  eyes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Black Tea Bags</strong> Black tea has lots of caffeine and tannins that helps to tighten the skin and draws out the excess water to relieve
  dark circles and puffy eyes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Peppermint Tea Bags</strong> A cold peppermint tea compress on your eyes will help to cleanse and reduce swelling with its cooling effect. It
  has a strong menthol aroma that causes eyes to water and the sinus to
  tingle to prevent dark circles caused by skin allergies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tips and Precautions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>You should not get tea in your eyes during treatments.</li>
  <li>Never use tea bags that are still hot. Use cold tea bags to reduce    the inflammation and blood circulation.</li>
  <li>Apply tea bags right after taking them from a fridge for best    results.</li>
  <li>Always apply new tea bags for each treatment.</li>
  <li>Chronic eye puffiness is a sign of some serious medical conditions.    So, make sure to consult your doctor if you get no relief from this<br>

","<p>Some of the oils in coffee (terpenes, in particular kahweol and cafestol) are believed to be the source of its effect on cholesterol.<sup>[<a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol/"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA401225/Does-Coffee-Raise-Cholesterol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>, <a href=""http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/11/3/586.long"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a>, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n9/full/1601668a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a>]</p>

<p>There are two ways to cut down on intake of cholesterol-influencing terpenes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Switch to filtered coffee.</strong> </sup> The terpenes are mostly retained in the paper filter instead of going into your drink. At the same time, cut down on the cream and sugar, as you already noted ;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quit drinking coffee completely.</strong> Even filtered coffee still has <em>some</em> terpenes present, and therefore can still impact cholesterol levels. Filtered coffee is a significant improvement — ""serum cholesterol raising effect of unfiltered coffee ... is reduced by about 80% in filtered coffee""<sup>[<a href=""http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n9/full/1601668a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a>]</sup> — but if you're being very rigorous about watching your dietary cholesterol intake, it may be time to quit.</p></li>

So how is it that I got a cut (it resembles a cut from a knife; straight and no width) on my head from being elbowed? I felt a little bit of pain that felt like it was coming from the bone, as I've felt that pain before and could recognize it, right after being elbowed.

<p>There's a few different reasons that this could occur, but basically it's because the skin was suddenly stretched or compressed beyond it's ability to hold shape, and a tear results. You can see a few different <a href=""http://www.injuryinformation.com/injuries/lacerations.php"" rel=""nofollow"">laceration causes at this page</a>. This can be fairly common in the head, as the skin is very close to the bone in most areas of the face and head.</p>

"Are there health benefits associated with avoidance of gluten?","126","","<p>Some people have <a href=""http://celiac.org/celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease"">celiac disease</a> and are instructed to avoid eating gluten, a protein found in certain grains. However, food manufacturers market gluten-free products to the general public as if gluten was detrimental for everybody. Are there proven health benefits of avoiding gluten for those without celiac disease? </p>
","<p>There are two main reasons why foods are made (or advertised) as gluten free. In short it is partially to meet the needs of a small but growing group of people who are allergic to gluten and also to catch people who are taking part in the gluten free fad.</p>

<p>The main reason is that there are different conditions out there that cause a person to have issues dealing with gluten one of them is a condition called celiac diease (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/celiac-disease/celiac-disease"" rel=""nofollow"">WebMD</a>/<a href=""http://celiac.org/celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">Celiac.org</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Celiac disease -- also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy -- is a digestive and autoimmune disorder that results in damage to the lining of the small intestine when foods with gluten are eaten. Gluten is a form of protein found in some grains. The damage to the intestine makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients, especially fat, calcium, iron, and folate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something that can be a very serious issue for people that have it</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Celiac disease can leave a person susceptible to other health problems, including:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Osteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones and leads to fractures. This occurs because the person has trouble absorbing enough calcium and vitamin D.
Miscarriage or infertility.
Birth defects, such as neural tube defects (improper formation of the spine) caused by poor absorption of such nutrients as folic acid.
Seizures.
Growth problems in children because they don't absorb enough nutrients.
Cancer of the intestine (very rare).</p>

<p>People with one of these conditions need to avoid all foods with gluten in them in order to avoid the effects of the condition</p>

<p>The second reason that food are made this way are because going gluten free has become a fad and food manufacturers are just cashing in on the latest trend.</p>

<p>Now when it comes to gluten free food there are some things that you need to remember. First there are types of gluten free food.</p>

<ol>
<li>Foods that are naturally gluten free and just need to be advertised as such</li>
<li>Foods that have gluten in them but easy changes can be made to remove it</li>
<li>Foods that have are based primarily on gluten based products and need to be changed drastically in order to be gluten free.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason that knowledge is important is that people who have a sensitivity to gluten can easily have issue from cross contamination. An example of this would be if a pizza place was making a gluten free pizza but they used the sauce and ladle that is used on normal pizza which will bring in contaminates to the gluten free food.</p>

"Can pathogens be transmitted from smelling something?","126","","<p>Long story short, when visiting neighbors the other day, a young child playing outside in the lawn stepped in some fresh animal fecal matter,  and not knowing what it was, ended up taking off their shoe and put it within about 2 inches from their face to sniff it.  The mother panicked, and after two calls to both poison control and the pediatrician, was told by both that as long as the child hadn’t swallowed any of the fecal matter, there was no need to worry about anything.</p>

<p>This made me curious.  By putting something as pathogen-laden as animal fecal matter (or vomit, etc) that close to your face smelling it, wouldn’t you essentially be inhaling all kinds of bacteria, viruses, parasites, etc, assuming they were present?  Or is the vacuum created by smelling something at that distance not strong enough to do this?  </p>
","<p>First, it is unlikely that the fecal matter was in fact pathogen-laden, but as a general statement should be treated as such.  Further pathogens that would be in fecal mater are mostly transmitted through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal-oral_route"" rel=""nofollow"">fecal-oral route</a>.  That's why on an individual case you have little to worry about without any symptoms, but as a general case we wouldn't recommend going around taking big sniffs of feces (I'm enjoying the ad campaign for this in my head). </p>

<p>But you mention ""vomit, etc,"" and it's worth pointing out there are pathogens that can infect through the respiratory tract from infectious fluids. This is mostly limited to things that can infect both your GI tract and respiratory tract, and that's not a long list (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus#Replication_cycle"" rel=""nofollow"">EBV</a> is a good example).  Further ""smelling something"" with an infectious respiratory virus (rhino, influenza, etc) can certainly cause an infection.  I would highly discourage sniffing used tissues.</p>

<p>A bigger concern are pathogens like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"" rel=""nofollow"">norovirus</a> which are so infectious, possibly down to 10 virions to cause infection (instead of 1000s or more), that it could enter your oral tract without your even knowing it.</p>

<p>Even if it was infectious, there's really nothing to be done until symptoms arise that can be treated.  Do feel free to discourage sniffing feces if that doesn't seem to be a self-correcting behavior.</p>

"Why do people infected with rabies have a fear of water?","125","","<p>Hydrophobia comes to mind when thinking of individuals infected by rabies... But is there a scientific/medical explanation as to <strong><em>why rabies, specifically, causes a fear to water, specifically?</em></strong> </p>

<p>Is it because swallowing is hard when one has rabies, and since water requires swallowing, they have hydrophobia? </p>

<p>Or does the fear of water also extend to fears of drowning? </p>

<p><strong>What exactly are they fearing of water? And how does rabies cause a fear specific to <em>water</em> and not just... everything?</strong></p>
","<p>When the rabies virus is spread to a new host, it first attacks muscle cells, which prevents the host's immune system from recognizing the invasion. Next, it binds to neurons at neuromuscular junction. Rabies virus is neurotropic, thus it binds preferentially to neurons, specifically the acetylcholine receptors on neurons. After binding the neuromuscular junction, it uses retrograde transport to travel up the neuron axon. When the virus reaches the neuron cell body, it rapidly spreads to the central nervous system, where it replicates in motor neurons and quickly reaches the brain. Next, it travels to the peripheral and autonomic nervous system and then finally reaches the salivary glands.</p>

<p>So, why does the rabies virus cause hydrophobia? The virus is accumulated in the salivary glands of the host so that it can be transmitted to the next host, often through wounds inflicted by a bite. As the virus spreads through bites, drinking water or swallowing would decrease transmission (by reducing quantities of infected saliva present in the mouth). To prevent this, the rabies virus causes painful spasms in throat and larynx. This causes saliva production in the host to be greatly increased, and also means that drinking, or even thinking about drinking, causes painful spasms in the throat. Since the muscular movements that occur while drinking are involuntary, and the virus has already infected autonomic nervous system and motor neurons, this is what enables it to control the involuntary muscle movements of throat and larynx in the host. This association of swallowing with the excruciating pain, and an inability to swallow, leading to choking, is what leads to fear of water.</p>

<p>Thus the term 'hydrophobia' in this case is somewhat misleading - bathing or a body of water might wouldn't trigger a hydrophobic response (unless ingestion of water was a possibility), as the fear is more specifically fear of choking on liquids due to impaired swallowing. </p>

  <p>Well, it overcomes colds in an hour or so, overcomes flu in less than 12 hours, overcomes pneumonia in less than 12 hours, cures more cancer than any other treatment by hundreds of times, cures hepatitis A, B, and C.

Appendicitis is an inflammation of the bowel. These are wildly different things, and that's not counting the ""hundred other diseases"". The two probably most potent medicines we have, antibiotics and steroids, don't even claim to be effective for all of these. </p>

<p><strong>MMS and autism</strong></p>

<p>Does MMS cure autism? Science doesn't usually say ""we are 100 percent sure this doesn't happen"". But in this case, it's probably pretty close. </p>

<p>All that the belief is based on are anecdotes, there are no scientific studies on this at all. There is also no proposed - MMS is a disinfectant, but autism isn't caused by an infection. </p>

<p>Autism doesn't stay constant. For example, there is a question here on Health.SE about autism and fever - <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3302/why-do-80-of-children-with-autism-appear-to-improve-when-they-have-a-fever#"">autism symptoms improve when patients have a fever</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Treatment of autism</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Autism spectrum disorder is a wide field of syndromes</a>. From high-functioning individuals to people who need constant caregiving. There are no cures. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/treatment.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Treatment includes various options.</a></p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/Pages/medication-treatment.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Medication</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently, there is no medication that can cure ASD or all of its symptoms. But in many cases, medication can help treat some of the symptoms associated with ASD, especially certain behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These behavioral issues are, for example, anxiety, repetitive behavior, hyperactivity and loss of focus, seizures (which one third of people with autism have), etc. </p>

<p>There are studies being done on more treatment options, for example on whether <a href=""https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/researchers-launch-study-oxytocin-nasal-spray"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oxytocin could help</a>. </p>

<p><em>Behavioral Therapy</em></p>

<p>Behavioral therapy is a big focus in the treatment of autism. Much of this is focused on children. I'm just going to link to and summarize a few of the resources on this. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A notable treatment approach for people with an ASD is called applied behavior analysis (ABA). ABA has become widely accepted among health care professionals and used in many schools and treatment clinics. ABA encourages positive behaviors and discourages negative behaviors in order to improve a variety of skills. The child’s progress is tracked and measured.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scientific studies have demonstrated that early intensive behavioral intervention improves learning, communication and social skills in young children with autism. While the outcomes of early intervention vary, all children benefit. Researchers have developed a number of effective early intervention models. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Other Treatments</em></p>

<p>Two other often mentioned treatments for ASD are dietary changes, especially a gluten free diet, and chelation. </p>

<p>A Cochrane review titled <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010766.pub2/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chelation for autism spectre disorder</a> summarizes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>no clinical trial evidence was found to suggest that pharmaceutical chelation is an effective intervention for ASD. Given prior reports of serious adverse events, such as hypocalcaemia, renal impairment and reported death, the risks of using chelation for ASD currently outweigh proven benefits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, chelation shouldn't be used. </p>

<p>Another, titled <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorder</a> summarizes the research on the most popular dietary restriction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research has shown of high rates of use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) for children with autism including gluten and/or casein exclusion diets. Current evidence for efficacy of these diets is poor. Large scale, good quality randomised controlled trials are needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cure</strong></p>

<p>I wrote before that autism can't be cured. However, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Growing evidence suggests that a small minority of persons with autism progress to the point where they no longer meet the criteria for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the diagnosis of autism isn't based on the presence of a virus or something, therapy and treatment can actually mean a person progresses to the point of no longer meeting all diagnostic criteria. </p>

You have supply of free drinkable water, utensils for cooking food and access to delivery of groceries from average-priced store. If you have to be able to negate all consequences of your diet, what is the optimal strategy for nutrition aimed at spending as little money as possible?</p>
","<p>There are several varieties of food stuffs that you could possibly pick from.</p>

<p><strong>PROTEINS</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Pinto beans</strong> (Price: $0.30 per 1/2 cup, $3 per can): Apart from the fact that it's cheap, pinto beans has a lot of <a href=""http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/pinto-beans-healthy-3779.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">health benefits</a> attached to it. A 1-cup serving of pinto beans contains about 250 calories. Pinto beans are small, but they contain impressive doses of certain vitamins and minerals. With just 2.5 grams of fat per 1-cup serving, pinto beans are a low-fat addition to your healthy eating plan.</p>

<p><strong>2. Eggs</strong> (Price: $0.19 per egg, $3.50 per dozen): When in need of some protein, eggs are a quick fix. Eggs are a <a href=""http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-eggs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very good source</a> of inexpensive, high quality protein. More than half the protein of an egg is found in the egg white along with vitamin B2 and lower amounts of fat and cholesterol than the yolk.

"Acne underneath skin","123","","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Okay, I've almost won my war. The battle, its almost won... However, I must still claim victory in my final battle. The battle against the little enemies, the ones that have fought with my blade of benzoyl peroxide <em>every single day.</em></p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Through spot treatments I have been able to fell every single one of these spots, but only the ones <strong>on</strong> my face. I've been using a spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide in, which has worked really well for me. However, my issue comes here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are spots underneath my skin, I think. The areas where they come through are a bit red.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, because there is still slightly red skin on my face, and I think this is causing my acne to constantly return. I need to stop this, and end my war once and for all.</p>

<h2>What I've tried</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Washing my face with a rag and sponge every day, three times a day</p></li>
<li><p>Changing my pillow case every day</p></li>
<li><p>Using a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing how much I touch my face</p></li>
<li><p>Not interfering with the spots with my fingers, not picking at them, not playing with them. Just letting spot creams eradicate them.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Seriously, this driving me up the wall. I spot cream in the evening, by the time tomorrow has ended and its time for a shower, they've all come back. Its like they're coming in waves, damn waves! I must put an end to this.</p>

<p>So, how can I prevent acne from coming back within the <strong>space of a single school day</strong>? How can I get rid of these once and for all? What types of measures could I try? I have no reason to visit my doctor, its only acne, but I have no idea what I can try now.</p>

<p><em>Is there even a point in me trying? I acknowledge that I am a teenager, but no others that I know seem to have acne/spots like I do.</em></p>
","<p>Currently, the only real way to ""get rid of acne once and for all"" is through the use of the prescription medication <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotretinoin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">isotretinoin</a>. It works to reduce sebum production and thusly decreases the incidence of new spots.</p>

<p>Warning: It's a serious medication with serious side effects -- for me most notably it was severely dry skin on every inch of my body. I've also personally done 2 rounds, as the dosage on the first go was not high enough to achieve desired (permanent) effects. Having said that, after the second course of treatment my skin improved dramatically and I only get a rare tiny pimple or two each month. It was (and can be) life-changing.</p>

<p>Do your resarch and speak with a doctor about options available to you specific to your personal skin situation.</p>

"Awkward: TWINS, but from DIFFERENT DADS? How rare is heteropaternal superfecundation (statistics)?","123","","<p>This is not a Jerry Springer headline -- despite all the sizzling, implicit drama involved -- <em>heteropaternal superfecundation</em> is a fertilization term when a woman is successfully impregnated by different/multiple men in the same ovulation cycle. </p>

<p>We all know that kitten and puppies from the same litter can be fathered by multiple males (yay for a variety of breeds!)... And we don't typically associate human pregnancies in the same boat because... to be fair... this is quite rare. <strong>But how rare is it?</strong> Statistics?</p>

<ul>
<li>So the infants are <strong>fraternal twins AND half-siblings</strong>? Is there a <strong>term</strong> that comprises this relationship.</li>
<li>What is the <strong>history</strong> behind <strong>identifying this fertilization process?</strong> <strong>When was it officially documented?</strong> Did they have any suspicions before DNA (like if children born different races)? </li>
</ul>
","<p>From this answer on Biology.SE (given and researched by me):</p>

<p>Yes, this is possible through something called heteropaternal superfecundation (see below for further explanation).</p>

<p>Of all twin births, 30% are identical and 70% are non-identical (fraternal) twins.</p>

<p>Identical twins result when a zygote (one egg, or ovum, fertilized by one sperm) splits at an early stage to become twins. Because the genetic material is essentially the same, they resemble each other closely.</p>

<p>Typically during ovulation only one ovum is released to be fertilized by one sperm. However, sometimes a woman's ovaries release two ova. Each must be fertilized by a separate sperm cell. If she has intercourse with two different men, the two ova can be fertilized by sperm from different sexual partners. The term for this event is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1488855"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heteropaternal superfecundation</a> (HS): twins who have the same mother, but two different fathers.</p>

<p>This has been proven in <em>paternity suits</em> (in which there will be a bias selecting for possible infidelity) involving fraternal twins, where genetic testing must be done on each child. The frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation <em>in this group</em> was found (in one study) to be 2.4%. As the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1488855"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study's authors</a> state, <strong>""Inferences about the frequency of HS in other populations should be drawn with caution.""</strong></p>

<p>So, to answer specifics, it's rare, the offspring are half-siblings without any further specific name, and yes, before (and since) DNA testing, there were cases of different race children, but as it is rare, there are not many. </p>

"I want to repair my digestive system","123","","<p>I've been experiencing diarrhea every morning for the past 8 months.</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>
","<p>8 months is a long time, so should see a doctor. Write down everything you have noticed that has changed (e.g. you may be losing weight, you may have heart palpitations, you may be eating a lot more or your appetite may be a lot less than what it used to be, etc. etc.). Then go to the doctor and mention everything that has changed. The doctor will likely ask a lot of questions, but if you have thought about your symptoms in advance then you are more likely to give the right answer. A potential problem is that when complaints have existed for long, you may get used to certain things causing you to give a wrong answer relating to changes in your body. </p>

"What causes smelly feet?","123","","<p><em>I suffer from smelly feet, which is very annoying particularly because I am in a new relationship.</em>
I have tried many OTC/home remedies to prevent this, but this doesn't really help.</p>

<p>According to this website (NHS) 
<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/foothealth/Pages/smellyfeet.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/foothealth/Pages/smellyfeet.aspx</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You're also more likely to have foot perspiration if you're on your
  feet all day, if you're under a lot of stress or if you have a medical
  condition called hyperhidrosis, which makes you sweat more than usual.
  Fungal infections, such as athlete's foot, can also lead to bad foot
  odour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have any of the conditions mentionned above (I am healthy and my GP told me I don't have hyperhidriosis or fungal infections). Also, I am not on my feet all the day. I did follow all the recommendations (changing socks and shoes every day, keeping my toenails short) without success.</p>

<p><strong>What are the causes of smelly feet? Could it be genetic? Or are there any other reasons (for a healthy individual)?</strong></p>
","<p><strong><em>This is an interesting question. You are certainly not an isolated case.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>The ""origin"" of foot odor has been examined in many studies.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3145263"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This study conducted by Marshall et al</a> focused on the microflora
found on normal feet (no foot odor) and compared it to feet with foot
odor. They reported a <strong>higher population densities of staphylococci and
aerobic coryneform bacteria in the feet with foot odor</strong>. They also
reported that these feets had higher exo-enzymes (lipase, protease,
and callous degrading enzymes) than the other feet.</li>
<li>During the same period, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2232162"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kobayashi et al</a> showed <strong>staphylococcus epidermidis</strong> was linked to the presence of foot odor or not</li>
<li>Some years later, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2369557"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a japanese group led by Kanda</a> analysed socks (!) and feet from two group of people (with/without odor) using a  gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). They reported that <strong>short-chain fatty acids</strong> were the primary components of foot odor</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In 2006, a very interesting study was conducted by a group of canadian researchers: their aim was to identify microorganisms that are involved in producing unpleasant odors and examine plant extracts and fragrant agents which would inhibit the routes of production of these substances.</em></p>

<p>Here first an overview of the <strong>fatty acid they have found ( acetic acid is responsible for the odor of sweat, isovaleric acid, propionic acid,
isobutyric acid, and butyric acid are involved in foot odor)</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mn5U9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mn5U9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then they looked at a difference in organisms distribution and found that <strong>bacilli were significantly different between the groups:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FR2c4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FR2c4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They then examined the possible role of naturally occurring materials using leucine dehydrogenase activity as an index (which is involved in foot odor), and obtained <strong>citral, citronellal, and geraniol</strong> as good competitive inhibitors. <strong>So these fragments are likely to inhibit foot odor.</strong></p>

<p>Why different bacteries are present in some individuals and not in another might be multifactorial and precipitated by diseases (fungus, endocrine disorders,...). I haven't found any study suggesting it might be genetic.</p>

<p><strong>Now, there are indeed many websites suggesting many different possible ways of treating foot odor. The only <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3810/psm.1996.08.1517?needAccess=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">peer-reviewed paper</a> I could find is was on <em>The Physician and Sportsmedicine</em> .

"Can a giant gummy bear (approx. 5 x 2 in.) give me diabetes?","122","","<p>I was given a giant gummy bear for my birthday.
I ate it in one sitting, just a few days ago.

<p>Now, there are three things troubling me.</p>

<p>Soon after I ate the giant gummy bear, I felt very tired - a symptom of diabetes.</p>

<p>From the day after I ate the gummy bear, I noticed my breath was slightly sweet. It usually smells really bad before I brush teeth in the morning. It stayed like that, which got me worried.</p>

<p>Today, my cough worsened. I had a drink. After brushing teeth, I coughed in the sink, which caused the drink to go up my nose and mouth - basically, I threw up. It could a symptom of diabetes, or just an effect of coughing with my head down like that.</p>

<p>Now, those three are symptoms of diabetes and I'm getting seriously worried. Should I tell my parents or my doctor? If so, how would I explain it to them? </p>
","<p>There are multiple questions here so I'll tackle them one by one. </p>

<p>Your initial question: Can a gummy bear give me diabetes?</p>

<p>One giant gummy bear, alone, is very unlikely to give you diabetes. I don't want to say indefinitely, because nothing in health is a definite. However, the likely hood is so close to 0% I would consider it insignificant. </p>

<p>Next, you stated that immediately following the ingestion of a cute gummy bear, you felt tired and the next morning your breathe smelled sweet. </p>

<p>The reason for both of these symptoms can very well be due to your sugar levels becoming drastically high. In the medical field, we call this DKA. (Diabetic ketoacidosis). Essentially, your body recognizes a sharp increase in blood glucose levels and is trying everything in the books to expel the glucose. Your body does this by releasing ketones from your respiratory system. DKA is most notably recognized by sweet smelling breathe. Almost like juicy fruit gum.</p>

<p>DKA can actually be a very serious emergency which, if unchecked, can lead to a diabetic coma. However, for individuals without diabetes, and a properly working pancreas, your sugar levels should be back to normal by now. </p>

<p>I believe your incident with the cough is completely unrelated. </p>

<p>To recap. No I do not think you have developed diabetes due to a single gummy bear. However, it never hurts to be checked for the disease. You could very well already have diabetes, and the gummy bear threw you into DKA. Because I cannot see you, nor properly perform any tests. To cover myself for any legal issues I will say that 1. I am not a doctor and 2. Go get it checked. </p>

<p>In regards to telling your parents. Just say you had some candy and you felt really weird afterwards and you're nervous that you might have diabetes. Any sensible parent will at least set you up with a doctors appointment. </p>

<li>Secondary progressive</li>
</ol>

<p>Severity, clinical manifestations and treatment options differ across these types. The most common type is RR. </p>

<hr>

<h2>RR therapeutic approach</h2>

<p>For RR there are two sorts of treatment:</p>

<ol>
<li>Treatment in an acute <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"" rel=""noreferrer"">relapse</a>, where short-term corticosteroid treatment is used to stop the attack</li>
<li>Disease modifying treatment - which is used regularly in order to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, and improve prognosis.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is the second group, where chemotherapy can be used, but, as mentioned above not as a first-line treatment. This means that other therapeutic options should be tried first. These are predominantly glatiramer acetate or interferon beta. If they don't work some other medicines are considered. Only if they don't work either, the next option is using chemotherapeutic agents.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How would a chemotherapeutic work in MS?</h2>

<p>There are, again two approaches. The first one is to use these medicines, at lower doses than to treat cancer, to suppress the immune system. Since MS is an autoimmune disease, immune suppression reduces the inflammation and damage to the myelin sheet. Another approach is to use these medicines to ablate the immune system prior to autologous stem cell transplant, where the patient's bone marrow is replaced with their stem cells. This line of treatment is, however, still in experimental phase and has not been approved. There are many complications, difficulties and side-effects of this procedure, and thus far the risks outweigh the benefits. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Some sorts of chemotherapeutic agents that have been used or tested for MS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cladribine has been tested for MS and even approved in some countries, but after it was rejected by the FDA and EMeA on the basis of lacking evidence for benefits outweighing the risks, the manufacturer stopped marketing applications, since new clinical trials would be costly. </p></li>
<li><p>Cyclophosphamide has also been investigated. Efficacy in aggressive form of disease was reported, but so were some serious adverse effects. Further research in necessary, and official guidelines, such as those by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) do not recommend use of cyclophosphamide in MS treatment. </p></li>
<li><p>Methotrexate has shown no significant efficacy in primary progressive MS, and was less effective than interferon beta in RR.</p>

<hr></li>
</ul>

","<p>Insulin resistance and obesity are both symptoms of type 2 diabetes, although they also occur at a prediabetic stage, before the diabetes diagnostic criteria are met. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014067369292814V"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Insulin resistance is highly predictive of diabetes</a>. In the <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giovanni_Targher/publication/13533291_Prevalence_of_insulin_resistance_in_metabolic_disorders_the_Bruneck_Study/links/00b4951dd5f59ca7d2000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bruneck study</a>, less than 10% of the insulin resistant subjects had no other metabolic disorder. But still, the exact relationship between insulin resistance and obesity is unclear, as they could</p>

<ul>
<li>have a common cause, or </li>
<li>one of them causes the other, or </li>
<li>be coupled in a positive feedback cycle, or</li>
<li>all of the above. But we know that they are highly correlated in untreated patients. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxrsV.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is the prevalence of insulin resistance in adolescents from <a href=""http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/11/2427.full#F1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NHANES</a>, with white circles denoting normal weight adolescents, black squares denoting overweight adolescents and black circles denoting obese adolescents. </p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/diabetes-003/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one of the theories</a> for the progression to diabetes is that the capacity of the body's usual fat depots is overtaxed, leading to having too much fat where it does not belong (e.g. intraabdominal fat deposits), resulting in lipotoxicity and finally diabetes. This would be a potential argument for obesity leading to insulin resistance. A common cause could be searched e.g. in <a href=""http://www.diapedia.org/metabolism/glp-1-defects-in-diabetes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reduced incretin secretion</a> or <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lufen_Chang/publication/11022576_A_central_role_for_JNK_in_obesity_and_insulin_resistance/links/5481cee20cf2941f830a02bd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">increased JNK activity</a>. But given the difficulty of finding a clear mechanism, and the complexity of the pathways involved, the connection is probably multifactorial.  </p>

<p>Weight loss is one of the goals in diabetes management. Exercise and dieting delay the progression of prediabetic stages to diabetes. They reduce both obesity and insulin resistance. So, to answer your question directly, <strong>if you had insulin resistance, and you managed to lose weight, it is very likely that your insulin sensitivity has increased.</strong> </p>

<p>The above assumes that the patient is not taking any metabolic treatment. If he is taking diabetes medications, their effect on insulin sensitivity and weight will be independent. Some medication classes like <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952301"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GLP 1 agonists</a> will reduce both obesity and insulin related effects, as will <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bariatric surgery</a>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Metformin</a> will improve insulin sensitivity without affecting weight much, while <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazolidinedione"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the glitazones</a> reduce insulin resistance but lead to weight gain. </p>

"Myelin regeneration in Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (Children)","120","","<p>Does myelin fully regenerate after a demyelization disease as ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis)? Does myelin always get damaged after an ADEM?</p>
","<p><strong>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)</strong> is an inflammatory disorder, which often follows an infection or a vaccination. It is the <strong>most frequent demyelinating disorder of the CNS in children</strong>. </p>

<p>In case of an infectious aetiology, some epidemiological studies suggest that ADEM is more frequently associated with upper respiratory tract infections in countries with significant advances in infectious disease control, whereas in poor or developed countries, ADEM often occurs after childhood infections such as measles. Below a table with a list of the possible aetiologies for ADEM (from Garg et al).</p>

  with high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with complete
  recovery, and tapering over more than 3 weeks, with a lower rate of
  relapses. MRI lesions could persist even in asymptomatic patients; in
  particular, periventricular lesions tended to disappear later than
  others.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit (after additional information was submitted by the OP)</em></strong></p>

<p>Probably yes, or at least that full remyelination has not completely finished. Concerning your question about the potential of remyelination: There isn't much information available on ADEM and remyelination, but at it shares some common features in terms of pathogenesis with multiple sclerosis (MS), let's take some evidence concerning remyelination in MS:</p>

<p>We know that the treatment of MS aims at two things (1,2):</p>

<ul>
<li>Prevent further damages by modulating the inflammatory processes. This is normally achieved with immunomodulatory therapies.</li>
<li>Repair the demyelination which resulted from the pathological inflammatory process by stimulation remyelination, ie the regeneration of new myelin sheats.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the first has showed some interesting results thanks to growing number of immunomodulatory therapies on the market (among which glucocorticoids, which are also used in ADEM treatment), the second has still to be proven. </p>

<p>Although some immunomodulatory therapies might indirectly stimulate remyelination, current therapies directly targeting regeneration of myelin sheats have yet to be proven. Furthermore, the presence of axon degeneration despite immunomodulatory therapies, suggest that axon integrity and protection may occur through mechanisms independent of inflammation (3,4).</p>

<p>Huang et al provide a good summary of <strong>current approach for remyelination</strong> (5):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The principal source of new remyelinating cells is an abundant and
  widely distributed population of cells in the adult CNS traditionally
  called oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In the adult CNS, these
  cells are both self-renewing and multipotent, having been observed to
  give rise to certain neurons, astrocytes (albeit rarely), and Schwann
  cells, as well as oligodendrocytes in vivo, and so can reasonably be
  regarded as a type of adult neural stem cell. The response to
  demyelination causes OPCs to become activated, a morphological change
  accompanied by upregulation of genes not normally expressed in the
  resting state. Activated OPCs proliferate, migrate and rapidly fill up
  the demyelinated lesions at a density that far exceeds that in normal
  tissue. To complete the remyelination process, the cells exit the cell
  cycle and differentiate into myelin sheath-forming oligodendrocytes,
  which is a complex process involving axon engagement, ensheathment and
  formation of compacted myelin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article by Huang et al also provides a good review (it is open access) on the current pharmacological targets for remyelination as well as the barriers of remyelination (among which age, probably explaining while cases of ADEM in the adults show a worse outcome that cases in children).</p>

<p>Hope this brings some clarification!</p>

"Pulmonary diseases and oxygen therapy","120","","<p>The <a href=""http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/fr/Le-ministere/Securite-civile/Documentation-technique/Le-secourisme/Les-textes-reglementaires"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">team first aid guidelines in France</a> say that for an adult victim, a saturation (SpO2) below 94 triggers the administration of 9L/min of oxygen using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rebreather_mask"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-rebreather mask</a>. We first aid guys are not doctors, so we strictly apply this rule before reporting to the medical control.</p>

<p>However, I noticed that when the victim is known or suspected<sup>1</sup> to have certain pulmonary diseases<sup>2</sup>, we are instructed to reduce the oxygen flow to 2L/minute or so, even if the SpO2 is still low<sup>3</sup>. This happens either when we contact the medical control or when a doctor arrives on the scene by request. </p>

<p>I find this interesting, so the following questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a precise pulmonary diseases list that require oxygen therapy to be handled that way ? </li>
<li>Why could a high O2 flow be deleterious for these particular diseases and not others?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just curiosity. I mean by this that I won't try to anticipate should such a case occur again in the future: it's only up to the doctor to order an oxygen flow that doesn't appear in the first-aid guidelines.</p>

<hr>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> We don't determine that by ourselves, a doctor does.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Not completely sure of what kind. Thanks to <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/users/169/anongoodnurse"">@anongoodnurse</a>'s heads-up I could determine that some of them were diagnosed or suspected COPDs, and some of them unknown to us (we were just not told what was precisely diagnosed or suspected).</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> The doctor can instruct us to do this, even if not according to the first-aid guidelines, as he/she has a higher competence.</p>
","<p>The basic idea is that <strong>people with pulmonary diseases that involve chronic hypoventilation rely on mild hypoxia to stimulate respiration.</strong></p>

<p>To understand this, consider a basic homeostatic feedback loop that controls respiratory drive. During a breath hold, carbon dioxide levels rise and oxygen levels fall. Carbon dioxide diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and causes a decrease in CSF pH sensed at central chemoreceptors in the brainstem. The peripheral serum pH may also be depressed, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. In normally ventilating people, these ""hypercarbic indicators"" are the primary mediators of the drive to breath.</p>

<p>In patients with chronic hypoventilation, PaCO<sub>2</sub> is chronically elevated. Common hypo-ventilatory diseases include:</p>

<ul>
<li>COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)</li>
<li>obesity-hypoventilation syndrome</li>
<li>neuro-muscular weakness syndromes (generally only in later phases when the diaphragm is affected: Becker/Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The old theory goes that because these folks have chronically elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub>*, the hypercarbic respiratory feedback loop described above “acclimates” and is no longer the primary driver of breathing. Instead, they rely on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxic_drive"">hypoxic respiratory drive</a>, which is secondary in normal people. These individuals may have a usual SpO<sub>2</sub> ~88-90%. When a non-rebreather mask is applied and suddenly drives their SpO<sub>2</sub> up to 100%, their respiratory drive decreases because their blunted hypercarbic response mechanisms do not respond normally to the progressive rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>There are data in support of this theory. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645328/#bib42"">One study in COPD patients</a> administered 100% oxygen to patients with COPD and observed a 18% decrease in ventilation after 15 minutes that returned to baseline when oxygen was removed (Aubier). However, these authors also showed that two other factors were at play explaining the observed rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>About 30% of the  increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> associated with high-flow oxygen administration was attributable to the <a href=""http://www.interactive-biology.com/6717/the-haldane-effect-and-uptake-of-carbon-dioxide-from-tissues/"">Haldane effect</a>, which is basically an offloading of CO2 by hemoglobin (due to a rightward shift of the carboxyhemoglobin dissociation curve), increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in blood but not reflecting a true change in ventilation. </p></li>
<li><p>An additional 48% of the increase in hypercapnia was due to dead space ventilation. The simplified idea is that the vessels in the lung compensate for hypoxia by vaso-constricting areas with low oxygen tension, so-called ventilation-perfusing matching. When high-flow oxygen is administered, the vaso-constriction is released so perfusion of poorly ventilated areas increases. Now a higher percentage of the blood is not being cleared of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is called ventilation-perfusion  &#8203;<strong>mis</strong>&#8203;matching. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1087886"">Something similar has been demonstrated in patients with obesity-hypoventilation</a> (Wijesinghe). In light of this, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645328/#bib42"">a recent study</a> investigated the best strategy for oxygen administration in patients with chronic hypoventilation (Kim). They found that a strategy titrating oxygen administration to achieve SpO<sub>2</sub> 88% to 92% minimized the risk of worsening hypoventilation while achieving adequate relief of shortness of breath and adequate oxygenation.</p>

"Difference in pain perception between women and men?","119","","<p>Recently, I joined my wife for the delivery of our first child.
At the end of the delivery, I told the midwife ""<em>that looked pretty painful</em>"". And she replied to me ""<em>it's painful for a woman, so you can imagine how painful a man would find it!</em>"" She and the obstetrician (who was a woman) added ""<em>pain sensitivity really differs between men and women</em>"".</p>

<p>It is not the first time I hear the last claim.</p>

<p><strong>I am wondering: is there any scientific evidence suggesting that pain perception varies between women and men?</strong></p>
","<p><em>As an addendum (with some contrasts) to the previous answer (To be honest, I had the same feeling that women have definitely a different pain threshold compared to men.)</em></p>

<p>According to WebMD (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/chronic-pain-conditions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/chronic-pain-conditions</a>),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is now widely believed that pain affects men and women differently.
  While the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone certainly play a role
  in this phenomenon, psychology and culture, too, may account at least
  in part for differences in how men and women receive pain signals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But interestingly, studies showed that men have a higher pain threshold than women:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>male experimental animals injected with estrogen, a female sex
  hormone, appear to have a lower tolerance for pain-that is, the
  addition of estrogen appears to lower the pain threshold. Similarly,
  the presence of testosterone, a male hormone, appears to elevate
  tolerance for pain in female mice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that the pain killing system in women and men work differently, as suggested by some studies showing that some painkiller (such as kappa-opioids, which are used in labour) work better in women than in men <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898754"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>.</p>

<p>The exact reasons for this difference in pain perception is, however still unknown.</p>

<p>Here extracts from the abstract of a study, which browsed the literature concerning pain perception in men and women:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, sex hormones influence pain sensitivity; <strong>pain threshold
  and pain tolerance in women vary with the stage of the menstrual
  cycle</strong>. Imaging studies of the brain have shown differences between men
  and women in the spatial pattern and intensity of response to acute
  pain. <strong>Among rodents, females are more sensitive than males to noxious
  stimuli and have lower levels of stress-induced analgesia.</strong> (...) <strong>Research on transgenic mice suggests
  that normal males have a higher level of activity in the endogenous
  analgesic system compared with normal females</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So probably, differences in pain perception between women and men is multifactorial: psychological, cultural and biological.</strong></p>

"Top medications to treat symptoms of Lupus?","119","","<p>Being new to the Lupus world, I am hearing conflicting views from all sorts of physicians (living both in Canada and the USA). What are the top medications to treat the symptoms of Lupus? I heard Lyrica and Cymbalta are great, but another doctor told me that the other doctor was misinformed, but neglected to tell me an alternative (just bad mouthed the other doctor). What are the typical, common, top medications used to treat the symptoms of Lupus? Thanks! </p>
","<p>Your question is difficult to answer (but still interesting) because lupus is a highly heterogeneous condition which can present various symptoms and organ involvement. <strong>Choice of therapy will be tailored on the patient symptoms and his disease activity and severity.</strong></p>

<p>Here a broad overview of the current management strategies of lupus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most frequent used of therapy in lupus patients (with any degree
of disease activity) should be <strong>hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine</strong>
(which are actually antimalarial drugs). These two drugs are associated with
symptoms relief and reduction of lupus flares, thrombotic events and
organe damage.</li>
<li>Other therapies can be used, depending on the severity of the disease
and the activity such as NSAID, prednison (short term therapy) or
steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy such as azathioprine or
methotrexate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and rituximab have been increasing used as long term therapy in lupus patients.</p>

<p>Finally, depending on the organ system involved, additionally strategies can be used. I don't know your case and why Lyrica (=pregabalin) or Cymbalta (=duloxetine) have been suggested by your physician. Some studies suggest that both pregabalin and duloxetine can be used as second line treatment in arthritis-related pain.</p>

<p>All above mentioned treatment should be started by a health professional as most of them need close monitoring and blood/radiological tests before some of these drugs are started.</p>

<p>I would suggest following website, which contains very useful information for patients with lupus:

"Does photographic (eidetic) memory exist or is it a medical myth?","118","","<p>I was always under the impression that photographic, aka eidetic memory (from the Greek word for ""form""), was a genuine, realistic condition. It's referenced in pop-culture a lot. As a child in grade school, I was always envious of the people somewhere out there that had this condition because I always wanted it for my math, spelling, history, geography, etc. tests. </p>

<p>However, this idealized ""photographic"" memory has seem more and more of a myth. Sure, some are born with a keen sense of memory than others, but they aren't just born with a photographic memory, but that this is something that they have to train their brains to do (I'm not sure if their memory/brain exercises will ever reach the degree of ""photographic"" -- does anyone know)? Anyway, is this a correct realization? <strong>Or does photographic/eidetic memory actually exist from birth?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Or is photographic memory only achieveable through memory exercises such as the ""memory palace""?</strong></p>

<p>I know that there is the condition of hyperthmesia, where individuals are able to recall vivid details from their own personal life, but that's not quite the same as seeing thousands of numbers and memorizing the order. But <strong>is hyperthemsia a real condition too?</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sv2Za.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sv2Za.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>Yes, both eidetic memory and hyperthemsia exist. And photographic memory has never been proven to exist. But they aren't what pop culture advertises them as. </p>

<p>Hyperthemsia first. It is the ability of a person to remember extremely detailed events from most of their life. But it is of limited use. It is an extremely self centered memory condition. Most people can only remember in great detail events that are important to them. Other things they they encountered along the way, they won't remember any better than the rest of us. And they are just as susceptible to false memories as the average person. Given a date they can generally give very detailed descriptions of personally important memories from that date. </p>

<p>Eidetic memory is the ability to look at an object once and remember everything about it for a short duration afterwards. A person with eidetic memory can glance at a long paragraph for a handful of seconds, then close his/her eyes, and, using the brain's ability to remember the image just seen, read it word for word back to you. Five minutes later mistakes will be made in the recall. 30 minutes later he/she will be able to give an extremely detailed summary of the paragraph. Very few can reproduce it perfectly after a few hours. About 2 to 10 percent of children below the age of 12 have this ability and it gradually fades away as they get older. Very few adults claim to have it. This is a short term memory ability. There are no proven cases of someone with a long term eidetic memory.</p>

So, can grapefruit seeds adversely affect Cialis the same way grapefruit juice does?</p>
","<p>Your question took me a while to research; it goes beyond basic medicine and delves into biochemistry, pharmacology, and physiology.  The short answer is: Yes!  It can; however, as you will see in the studies that are linked, it's <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12953340?dopt=Abstract"">dose dependent</a>.  From what I found, the primary culprit of drug interactions in grapefruit juice lies in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8485024"">naringenin</a>; however, other <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16338240"">compounds</a> play a role as well. Naringenin is a natural compound (a flavonoid) found in fruits such as grapefruit, oranges, and tomatoes. The concentration of naringenin can be viewed in the following studies.</p>

"How to deal with pale fingers in cold weather?","118","","<p>What is this condition called when one or more fingers go pale every time when being in a cold environment?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d9YPwm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is it something that can be handled without having to relocate to exotic countries? </p>
","<p>The phenomenon you are describing and the one shown in the picture is known as Reynaud's phenomenon.  In cold temperatures, the body constricts the peripheral blood vessels to prevent losing heat from the blood to the outside air.  In Reynaud's phenomenon, this constriction is exaggerated  and may prevent blood flow to the fingers or toes (and sometimes other areas) giving rise to the pale appearance shown in your picture.</p>

<p>Reynaud's phenomenon can be classified as primary or secondary.  </p>

<p>Primary Reynaud's phenomenon, often simply referred to as Reynaud's disease is where the phenomenon is not associated with any underlying disease, and the cause is ideopathic (unknown).  Primary Reynaud's phenomenon is considered to be a benign condition.</p>

<p>Secondary Reynaud's phenomenon occurs when there is an underlying disease that is causing the condition, the most common of which are connective tissue disorders such as lupus (SLE).</p>

<p>For treating the phenomemon, your doctor will first want to ensure that you do not have secondary Reynaud's phenomenon, and if you do, the treatment will vary depending on the underlying disease.</p>

<p>If you are found to have primary Reynaud's disease, then there are also a variety of treatment options available that should be discussed with your health care provider.  Some of the options include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vasodilators - Vasodilators relax blood vessels increasing blood flow.  Creams such as nitroglycerin cream applied to base of fingers may help heal ulcers.</li>
<li>Calcium channel blockers - Relax and open small blood vessels in your
hands and feat, decreasing frequency of attacks.</li>
<li>Alpha blockers - These drugs counter the actions of noradrenaline, a
hormone that acts to constrict blood vessels.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, your doctor will likely advise you to not smoke (as smoking is associated with lower skin temperature due to constriction of blood vessels), exercise more (as exercising can increase circulation) and control stress (which may help avoid attacks).</p>

"What is the safety margin on duration of an antibiotics (levofloxacin) treatment?","118","","<p>Recently I was prescribed an antibiotics (levofloxacin) treatment of 500mg daily for 7 days. Being in Indonesia the doctors generally don't give any information and I took my first dose at exactly the same time as a high dosage vitamin/mineral supplement. Later I read that this actually may have pretty much voided the first dose entirely, see <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14495-8235/levofloxacin-oral/levofloxacin-oral/details"">WebMD</a>  concerning ""taking other products that may bind to it"" or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When levofloxacin is taken with anti-acids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts that are difficult to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is taken with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this enough reason to buy an extra dose on my own and continue for 1 more day or is there enough safety margin built into these treatments that account for some incorrect usage?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, what you read about chemical interactions of levofloxacin with polyvalent cations is correct - the medicine binds to the cation to form a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex#Nomenclature_and_terminology"" rel=""nofollow"">coordination complex</a> in the gastrointestinal tract, which then cannot be absorbed. </p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/24624"" rel=""nofollow"">SPC of levofloxacine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levofloxacin absorption is significantly reduced when iron salts, or magnesium- or aluminium-containing antacids, or didanosine (only didanosine formulations with aluminium or magnesium containing buffering agents) are administered concomitantly with levofloxacin tablets.. Concurrent administration of fluoroquinolones with multi-vitamins containing zinc appears to reduce their oral absorption. It is recommended that preparations containing divalent or trivalent cautions such as iron salts, zinc-salts or magnesium- or aluminium-containing antacids, or didanosine (only didanosine formulations with aluminium or magnesium containing buffering agents <strong>should not be taken 2 hours before or after Levofloxacin</strong>  [...] administration. Calcium salts have a minimal effect on the oral absorption of levofloxacin.*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the length of therapy, the same source recommends different duration, depending on the diagnosis (from 3 days for urinary tract infections up to 8 weeks for antrax; the most common therapy duration for respiratory infections is 7 to 10 days (depending on the severity).</p>

<p>This is the most important factor that determines for how long you should take the medicine, but there are other factors: the severity of the condition, your progress, the strain of bacteria (some are more sensitive then others) and also the dose (levofloxacine can be given by mouth in doses of 250 mg daily, but this depends on the condition, your body mass, liver and kidney function etc.).</p>

<p>In conclusion, I'm sorry to say, but this would be a question for your doctor. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>All the way down there's also a point about the manner of preservation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""24. Different preservation methods could result in the formation of
  carcinogens (e.g. N-nitroso compounds), but whether and how much this
  contributes to the cancer risk is unknown.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WHO doesn't go this far, but based on compounds in some processed meat that are carcinogenic by itself (smoke and N-nitroso compounds), I'd assume a large part of the carcinogenic risk of processed meat can be explained by the presence of these compounds. </p>

<p>The sodium triphosphate that's in your chicken is technically a preservative. However, sodium triphosphate preserves the meat by retaining water, slowing down the drying process. </p>

<p>Sodium triphosphate itself is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_triphosphate"" rel=""nofollow"">perfectly safe</a>, I think the limits on the quantity that you can add are present mainly because it can be used to cheaply increase the weight of meat/fish.

<p><strong>I include the following note/disclaimer because 1) it shows my point of view on the question asked, and 2) it will hopefully cut of some comments I suspect are likely to come from such a post.</strong></p>

<p>As I'm sure it will come up, it certainly could be true that additional cannabinoids will come up to be medically significant, perhaps in certain combinations, and that may require inhalation as a delivery route.  I'm happy for that research to be conducted, and I wait to see what comes out as scientifically valid.  </p>

<p>I note that burning and inhaling of a raw plant, with all the chemicals that are produced in the process, is not something I would recommend to any patient.  That goes from tobacco, to cannabis, to grass clippings.  We have nebulizers to aerosol drugs that need to be inhaled.</p>

<p>This is where taking traditional medicine as a start, and then advancing it to ""Western Medicine"" comes in.  The scientific method has born out in pharmacology, and needed active ingredients from plants/animals can be identified, derived, purified, and normalized so that they can be safely and consistently applied in ""Western Medicine"" (which can be called ""traditional"" by the people practicing it). </p>

"Wrong region for accumulation of fat","116","","<p>I am a female in my mid 20. I am 5 ft(sadly, very short about which I do feel insecure all the time) with a weight of 48 kg approx. Now as you can imagine, I am very thin.<br> Infact my collar bones are so clearly visible that my mum often think that i am suffering from malnutrition. Somehow most of the fat in accumulating near thigh and belly region, but not where it should be like hands(I have skeletal hands) and near the collar(collar bones give a skeletal effect). 
<br>Is there anything I can do to avoid accumulation of fat in the wrong region and make it accumulate in the right region. Also I have heard that fat accumulation near the lower body area might lead to gynecological problems.<br> Tell me what should I do.</p>
","<p>I think there is only so little you can do about the fat accumulation. These things are work of natural evolution and genetics.</p>

<p>From the <em>Female body shape</em> article in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_body_shape"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Estrogens cause higher levels of fat to be stored in a female body than in a male body. They also affect body fat distribution, causing fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs, and hips in women, but generally not around their waists, which will remain about the same size as they were before puberty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the problem you are having is a matter of female hormones and associated genetic, which cannot be altered.</p>

<p>Due to the same facts, the issue is different in males:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android fat distribution describes the distribution of human adipose tissue mainly around the trunk and upper body, in areas such as the abdomen, chest, shoulder and nape of neck. This pattern may lead to an ""apple-shaped"" or central obesity, and is more common in males than in females. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_fat_distribution"">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My most sincere ""answer"" to you is that you start doing some weight lifting. Focus on the whole body. With appropriate training, your buttocks and thighs will become firmer. When working on your whole upper torso (back + arms) your skeletal muscle will become also firmer which will have on huge influence on your looks. Moreover, with weight lifting and general fitness exercise your posture will become better, also affecting on your looks. Moreover, will intensive enough training you´ll lose fat from the same region it has been accumulating.</p>

<p>Try to rest it as much as possible and keep the limb elevated above the heart as much as you can until you have professional medical advice.</p>

<p>In my situation:</p>

<p>I saw the orthopaedic specialist today. The conclusion from the x ray is that yes, it's fractured... But the ""good"" news is that I only have a fracture boot and can load bear on my heel as much as pain allows.</p>

<p>The summary is that there's a lateral metatarsal ligament that binds the knuckles of the metatarsals together, and as long as only 1 of the central metatarsals is fractured, it is in effect supported in position by that ligament and the two either side act as splints.</p>

<p>In that the bone is in the correct position, it'll not drop back (if more than one was fractured, the ligament would pull it back) and it'll be 3 -4 weeks before I can start to weight bear and 6 weeks should be back to <strong>ahem</strong> normal. No pins or plates required.</p>

"What will happen if you keep running? What will eventually cause you to stop?","115","","<p>A more specific form of my question would be, ""Barring mental barriers, what will lead to collapse after extended cardiovascular exercise?""  I was considering asking this in the worldbuilding SE, but I figured that I would get more detailed or realistic answers here.</p>

<p>When you do cardiovascular exercise for an extended period of time, the typical process (pretty much as roughly speaking as possible) is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the exercise.</li>
<li>Make the conscious decision to stop doing the exercise once you're sufficiently exhausted or once you've exercised for a sufficiently long time.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can make the argument that there are some exercise routines that swap step 2 for ""Get to the point where you can't do the exercise anymore and stop there,"" in which case the decision to stop wouldn't exactly be a conscious decision.  I suspect, however, that even with an exercise routine like that, if someone pointed a gun to your head and told you to keep exercising, then you could probably keep going.  Those mental barriers are just too strong: at some point, your brain will say ""No more!"" before your body does and you will stop prematurely.</p>

<p>In stories that I write, I occasionally run into the scenario of characters in a ""run for your life"" sort of situation, where something is perpetually on their tail that they need to escape from.  They can't slow down or stop: they have to go as fast as they can for as long as they can in order to escape danger.  In this sense, it's like the hypothetical I described: a gun is basically being pointed to their heads and they're being forced to keep running.  At this point, mental barriers are thrown out of the window in order to prevent premature death, so they're not going to get in the way.</p>

<p>But something will eventually.  At some point, the hero will collapse, and I'm interested in knowing what's going on in the body when that point finally happens.  Do the muscles cease their functionality due to a deficiency of ATP?  Do you briefly black out or pass out due to lack of oxygen (or rather, a surplus of CO2) being distributed through the body?  Or is it <em>still</em> going to be a mental barrier that inevitably causes collapse (in other words, will something kick in the brain before other parts of your body fail that will force you to stop running regardless of external stimuli)?</p>

<p>We can assume that prior to the extended sprint, the character is well-rested and hydrated.  If different cardiovascular exercises are expected to yield different results, we can limit things to just running, since that's what I'm primarily interested in.  Also, since many people can jog pretty much indefinitely provided the jog is slow enough, we can assume that the character is continuously exercising at the peak of his or her capabilities.</p>
","<p>It's been my understanding that a buildup of lactic acid (aka lactate) eventually causes the muscles to stop being able to process glucose. <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-lactic-acid-buil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This article</a> from Scientific American describes the processes the muscles use to convert to an anaerobic process as muscle performance outpaces oxygen supplies.

"If a human is irradiated, how contagious are they?","114","","<p>If a human is exposed to radioactive materials but later they are removed from their body, does the human remain capable of contaminating others? Is there a decay curve for the risk of contagion, possibly correlated with the half life of the radioactive substances?</p>
","<p>This is an excellent question.  </p>

<p>Let us give an example of a procedure that some humans really need to be exposed to - and that is  <a href=""http://www.oncolink.org/treatment/article.cfm?id=35"" rel=""nofollow"">Radiation Therapy</a>.  </p>

<p>Radiation therapy is usually given to cancer patients to destroy a tumor. Technically, there are two methods of giving radiation to a patient for therapeutic purposes - <a href=""http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/radiation-therapy/what-radiation-therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">External and Internal radiation therapy</a>. </p>

<p>When we talk about <strong>External Radiation therapy</strong>, we are talking about radiation administered through a beam to a specific region of the body. Basically, it is non-invasive because it uses only a machine with a beam that directs radiation to the specific body part containing the tumor.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the radiation is given in relatively
  small doses, patients who receive external radiation therapy are not
  considered radioactive and do not need to take any special precautions
  during the time they are being treated. It is safe for friends,
  family, and children to be around them - <a href=""http://www.oncolink.org/treatment/article.cfm?id=35"" rel=""nofollow"">OncoLink</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, patients undergoing <strong>internal radiation therapy</strong> (<a href=""http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/diagnosis-and-treatment/radiation-therapy/brachytherapy/?region=on"" rel=""nofollow"">brachytherapy</a>) get radioactive implants to destroy the tumor. This procedure is considered invasive because doctors need to put the radioactive implants inside the body where the tumor is located. Commonly used radioactive substance in implants are <em>cesium, gold, iodine, iridium, and palladium</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Different radioactive materials have different half-lives. This
  information helps the radiation therapy team to choose the type of
  material to use and plan the treatment regimen. It also determines how
  long radiation safety precautions must be taken following treatment -  <a href=""http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/diagnosis-and-treatment/radiation-therapy/brachytherapy/?region=on"" rel=""nofollow"">Canadian Cancer Society</a>.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, if high dosage is being used in the therapy, expect that a small amount of radiation will be left in the patient's body after the implants removal. As the <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/radiation/understandingradiationtherapyaguideforpatientsandfamilies/understanding-radiation-therapy-internal-radiation-therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">American Cancer Society</a> states that, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With internal radiation therapy, your body may give off a small amount
  of radiation for a short time.</p>
  
  <p>If the radiation is contained in a temporary implant, you will be
  asked to stay in the hospital and may have to limit visitors during
  treatment. You also may be asked to stay a certain distance away from
  them. Pregnant women and children may not be allowed to visit you.
  Your body fluids are not radioactive. Once the implant is removed,
  your body will no longer give off radiation.</p>
  
  <p>Permanent implants give off small doses of radiation over a few weeks
  to months as they slowly stop giving off radiation. The radiation
  usually doesn’t travel much farther than the area being treated, so
  the chances that others could be exposed to radiation is very small.
  Still, your health care team may ask you to take certain precautions
  such as staying away from small children and pregnant women,
  especially right after you get the implants. Again, body fluids and
  the things you use will not be radioactive.</p>

"Do you need to consume iodised salt?","113","","<p>I don't eat table salt anymore except on very special occasions when I'm eating out or something like that, but in my home I prefer to use herbs and other things to add taste to food and avoid using salt when possible (e.g I don't add salt to eggs or french fries).</p>

<p>Do I need to worry about not getting enough iodine? Is it healthy to only get the sodium you need from food, provided you eat a healthy Westerner diet? </p>
","<p>Iodine is absolutely an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_element"" rel=""noreferrer"">essential mineral</a>, and is required for proper functioning of your body. It is a component of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"" rel=""noreferrer"">thyroid hormone</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"" rel=""noreferrer"">triiodothyronine</a> (also known as T3) and its precursor form T4 (thyroxine). This hormone is involved in quite a few processes in the body, and acts on nearly every cell in it. </p>

<p>A deficit of iodine can cause a number of diseases, including <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"" rel=""noreferrer"">goiter</a> (swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"" rel=""noreferrer"">hypothyroidism</a> (can cause increased sensitivity to cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and depression), <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642482"" rel=""noreferrer"">gastric cancer</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretinism"" rel=""noreferrer"">cretinism</a> (presents as severely stunted development and growth, both physical and mental, but unlikely to affect a healthy adult).</p>

<p>Now, iodized salt is not the only source of iodine in one's food. It can also be found in fish, shellfish, and kelp products, milk and eggs from iodine-sufficient farm animals, and plants grown on iodine-rish soil. The <a href=""http://iom.nationalacademies.org/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRI_Elements.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">recommended intake</a> of iodine varies between 150 &micro;g per day for healthy adults to 250-290 &micro;g/day for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. Children require somewhat lower amounts. On the other hand, the recommended upper limit is around 1100 &micro;g (1.1 mg) per day for adults. </p>

<p>A quarter teaspoon (1.5g) of the iodized sea salt in my cabinet provides ""45%"" of the recommended daily value of iodine (the label doesn't provide mass). Assuming they're using the 150 &micro;g value, that's 67.5 &micro;g iodine in a serving that provides one quarter of your sodium for the day. The table in <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iodine-HealthProfessional/#h3"" rel=""noreferrer"">this section</a> of the Health Professional Fact Sheet for iodine from the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements provides some values for iodine levels in various other food sources:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wlDvz.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wlDvz.png"" alt=""iodine levels""></a></p>

<p>So, bottom line, you are likely getting sufficient iodine in your daily diet, even without using iodized salt. Now, I don't want to discourage the use of it at all, as there is absolutely nothing wrong with it from a health perspective (except from overconsumption, but that applies to most everything). Not everyone (especially in America, the UK, and some other countries) eat very healthy diets, but since the use of iodized salt in restaurants and for food manufacturers is required by law, Westerners are not likely to be under-iodinated.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to tell is to go to your primary health care provider, explain your situation, and ask if they'd be willing to order a thyroid function blood test. It looks at the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, from the pituitary gland) along with thyroid hormone itself. However, as long as you aren't experiencing any of the symptoms of hypothyroidism and don't have a goiter, you're probably OK.</p>

"Does oral consumption of animal cancer cells increase your chance of getting cancer?","113","","<p>I came across of this question when I was cooking a beef dish the other day. </p>

<p>If the beef I used for cooking came from a cow that had cancer, and even worse, if part of the beef I used in a dish actually contained cancer cells, could consuming the dish increase my chances of getting cancer? </p>
","<p>For any reasonable risk, the answer is no.  Virtually all tumors are non-transmissible under normal (non-laboratory) circumstances (three exceptions, discussed below, none in humans), so you could not possibly get the cancer the animal had.</p>

<p>However some cancers arise because of environmental factors which may still be present in the animal.  For example, an animal exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) would be at a higher risk of developing cancer, and PCBs also tend to stay around in the animal for some time.  It is at least possible that environmental exposure which gave the animal cancer is still around to increase the risk to you.  In general, this is probably a pretty low risk from any one instance of eating a tumorous animal.  However if you were to eat animals which were routinely contaminated with something carcinogenic, it could become a problem.  </p>

<p>A similar story could be told about oncoviruses, that is viruses which can cause tumors or cancer.  However all the oncoviruses known to date are restricted to humans.  Further, if there were an hitherto unknown oncovirus which caused the tumor in the animal and still could cause an infection and neoplasm in humans, it would have to survive cooking and consumption.  This route seems improbable.</p>

<p>The least probable route would be a directly transmissible tumor.  There are two such tumors known: Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease and canine transmissible venereal tumor.  A third variety was discovered this year (<a href=""http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674%2815%2900243-3?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415002433%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"" rel=""noreferrer"">Metzger 2015</a>), which is found in clams.  None affects humans.  Further, the chances of such a disease being able to transmit across species seems very improbable.  Finally, food preparation is almost certain to kill off the tumor cells.</p>

<p>In summary, it is very improbable that eating an animal which had a neoplasm would pose any risk.</p>

","<p>My Grandmother died of a ischemic stroke (TIA followed by blockage) after weaning herself off of blood thinners because she didn't <strong>""need the medicine""</strong>.</p>

<p>Huge issue with his advice - the large majority of strokes are due to a clot or another form of vessel blockage. The rest caused by a hemorrhage (you'll have the worst headache of your life) while bleeding profusely internally.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That advice literally makes me mad <strong><em>(not at you)</em></strong> -- but whoever wrote it.
   <br><em>Physiologically it makes no sense.</em>  In most cases that would kill someone.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Below is Advice According to the MayoClinic.org</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>

<hr>

<p>Watch for these signs and symptoms if you think you or someone else may be having a stroke. Note when your signs and symptoms begin, because the length of time they have been present may guide your treatment decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trouble with speaking and understanding.</strong> You may experience confusion. You may slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg.</strong> You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Similarly, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.</p></li>
<li><strong>Trouble with seeing in one or both eyes.</strong> You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.
Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate you're having a stroke.
Trouble with walking. You may stumble or experience sudden dizziness, loss of balance or loss of coordination.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><strong>When to see a doctor</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Seek immediate medical attention</strong> if you notice any signs or symptoms of a stroke, even if they seem to fluctuate or disappear.</p>

<p><em>Think ""FAST"" and do the following:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Face. Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?</li>
<li>Arms. Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?
Or is one arm unable to raise up?</li>
<li>Speech. Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is his or her
speech slurred or strange?</li>
<li>Time. If you observe any of these signs, call 911 immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Don't wait to see if symptoms go away. Every minute counts. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability.</p>

<p>If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Causes</strong></h2>

<p>A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die.</p>

<p>A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ischemic Stroke</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). The most common ischemic strokes include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thrombotic stroke.</strong> A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your
brain. A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up
in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other
artery conditions. </li>
<li><strong>Embolic stroke.</strong> An embolic stroke occurs when a    blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain — commonly in    your heart —
and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in    narrower brain
arteries. This type of blood clot is called an    embolus.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hemorrhagic stroke</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or
   ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that
   affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure
   (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in
   your blood vessel walls (aneurysms).</p>

<p>A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal
   tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation)
   present at birth. Types of hemorrhagic stroke include:
 - <strong>Intracerebral hemorrhage.</strong> In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain
   tissue, damaging brain cells. Brain cells beyond the leak are
   deprived of blood and also damaged.</p>

<p>High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Subarachnoid hemorrhage.</strong> In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space
between the surface of your brain and your skull. This bleeding is
often signaled by a sudden, severe headache.</p>

<p>A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the bursting of a
small sack-shaped or berry-shaped outpouching on an artery known as
an aneurysm. After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain
may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell
damage by further limiting blood flow.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Transient ischemic attack (TIA)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — also known as a ministroke — is a brief period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke. A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which often last less than five minutes.</p>

<p>Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your brain. A TIA doesn't leave lasting symptoms because the blockage is temporary.</p>

<p>Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up. Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-blown stroke, causing permanent damage later. If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart.</p>

<p>It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms. Up to half of people whose symptoms appear to go away actually have had a stroke causing brain damage.</p>

","<p>just a short answer, since no-one has responded yet:</p>

<p><strong>Diaphragm</strong></p>

<p>Except from deepening your breath by expanding the volume of the lungs down towards the belly,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the diaphragm is also involved in non-respiratory functions, helping to expel vomit, feces, and urine from the body by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, and preventing acid reflux by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the esophageal hiatus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm#Function"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>But this is only one aspect of many more, others are</p>

<ul>
<li>posture -> since the diaphragm inserts at the lower ribs and the vertebrae it influences the way you spine is aligned</li>
<li>lung volume -> when the diaphragm contracts during inhalation, it expands downwards and gives way to the lungs to expand as well. thus you have a bigger volume and can breath in more air.</li>
<li>slower breathing -> the more air you breath in, the slower you breath, this may lead to a relaxation during stress situations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nasal breathing</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is often considered superior to mouth breathing[6][7] for several reasons. Air travels to and from the external environment and the lungs through the nasal passages, as opposed to the mouth. The nasal passages do a better job of filtering the air as it enters the lungs. In addition, the smaller diameter of the nasal passages creates pressure in the lungs during exhalation, allowing the lungs to have more time to extract oxygen from them. When there is proper oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, the blood will maintain a balanced pH. If carbon dioxide is lost too quickly, as in mouth breathing, oxygen absorption decreases. Nasal breathing is especially important in certain situations such as dehydration, cold weather, laryngitis, and when the throat is sore or dry because it does not dry the throat as much.</p>

"Body's response to rapid ingestion of water?","112","","<p>As we are all aware, if you drink a large quantity of water in a short time period, you will  likely have to go to the toilet not too long afterwards.</p>

<p>The body detects the increase in fluid volume (or more precisely in this instance the decrease in sodium concentration) and kicks off the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway.</p>

<p>This ultimately results in a decrease in anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) which in turn decreases water absorption from the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubule in the kidney.</p>

<p>So my question is, if we rapidly consume a large volume of water in a very short period of time, could the resulting decrease in ADH hormone overshoot the mark and result in the body eliminating more water than what is ideal.</p>

<p>That is, could drinking a large amount of water in a short time actually have a dehydrating effect?</p>
","<p>I don't belive it is possible for the body to produce too much ADH.  The body will likely produce insufficient ADH to eliminate the ingested water, thus you will still remain in a state of hyponatremia even after the body's ADH response.</p>

<p>The body will then return to homeostatus by reducing thirst.</p>

<p>This means of course that if you ingest too much water (ignoring your lack of thirst) you can create serious health problems for yourself.</p>

"Should we all eat more Protein?","112","","<p>A health conscious person might wander around these days and see a lot of advertising going on, that says: ""Eat More Protein!""</p>

<p>If you go to a site that calls itself healthline you are even presented with the title:  ""<a href=""http://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-to-eat-more-protein"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10 Science-Backed Reasons to Eat More Protein</a>""</p>

<p>Is this really the case? For everyone? What are scientifically valid reasons that might object to such a broad and general advice?</p>
","<p>It depends on the diet and the person. However, protein myths abound because people look at extreme ends of the scale, and assume that outlier needs are suitable for the masses.</p>

<p>If you are looking for homeostasis and general maintenance, then the upper limit that has been shown in studies to be beneficial is 1.6g/kg/d, or about .73g/lb/day. 1g/lb/day is a little bit of overkill, but is an easy mark to remember. Where the outlier comes in is people using steroids for bodybuilding, which allows greater protein use than in a naturally training person.</p>

<p>If you are looking for weight/fat loss with lean mass maintenance (i.e. losing as little muscle as possible while cutting calories), then a higher rate of protein intake is recommended to help make up for caloric deficits in carbohydrates. It is also noted that the higher the level of athlete, the <em>less</em> you need the protein (i.e. elite level athletes need less protein than beginners, as counterintuitive as that sounds).</p>

<p>From a <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2011.619204?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meta analysis by Philips and Loon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our consensus opinion is that leucine, and possibly the other branched-chain amino acids, occupy a position of prominence in stimulating muscle protein synthesis; that protein intakes in the range of 1.3–1.8 g · kg−1 · day−1 consumed as 3–4 isonitrogenous meals will maximize muscle protein synthesis. These recommendations may also be dependent on training status: experienced athletes would require less, while more protein should be consumed during periods of high frequency/intensity training. Elevated protein consumption, as high as 1.8–2.0 g · kg−1 · day−1 depending on the caloric deficit, may be advantageous in preventing lean mass losses during periods of energy restriction to promote fat loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That article is an excellent read, and contains many links and references to studies on various protein intakes for low to elite level athletes and body builders.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another very well written article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To check if maybe there still isn't a slight benefit of going higher in protein that all these studies couldn't find, I co-authored a meta-analysis with some of the world's leading fitness researchers. We again a cut-off point at exactly 1.6g/kg/d beyond which no further benefits for muscle growth or strength development are seen.</p>
  
  <p>Based on the sound research, many review papers have concluded 0.82g/lb is the upper limit at which protein intake benefits body composition (Phillips &amp; Van Loon, 2011). This recommendation often includes a double 95% confidence level, meaning they took the highest mean intake at which benefits were still observed and then added two standard deviations to that level to make absolutely sure all possible benefits from additional protein intake are utilized. As such, this is already overdoing it and consuming 1g/lb ”˜to be safe' doesn't make any sense. 0.82g/lb is already very safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examining the article you link in the question, the end includes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though a higher protein intake can have health benefits for many people, it is not necessary for everyone.
  <strong>Most people already eat protein at around 15% of calories, which is more than enough to prevent deficiency</strong>.
  However, in certain cases, people can benefit from eating much more than that, or up to 25-30% of calories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>It then links to an article on ""how much protein you should be eating"", which notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A common recommendation for gaining muscle is 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, or 2.2 grams of protein per kg.
  Numerous studies have tried to determine the optimal amount of protein for muscle gain and many of them have reached different conclusions.
  Some studies show that over 0.8 grams per pound has no benefit (13), while others show that intakes slightly higher than 1 gram of protein per pound is best (14).
  <strong>Although it's hard to give exact figures because of conflicting results in studies, 0.7-1 grams (give or take) per pound of body weight seems to be a reasonable estimate</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>So while all the articles agree that a general intake of around 1g/lb/day is the upper limit of beneficial, they also agree that in specific diets and goals, increasing the amount of protein can aid in weight loss and lean mass retention. I believe that is the intent of your original article, despite the somewhat click bait title.</p>

"Do all neurodegenerative diseases show up on an MRI scan?","111","","<p>Do all neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc. show up on an MRI scan?</p>
","<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms (memory impairment for Alzheimer Disease/ bradykinesia, tremor and rigor for Parkinson Disease) +/- neuropsychological tests. </p>

<p><strong>The current role of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of neurogenerative diseases such as Parkinson Disease or Alzheimer Disease is mainly supportive</strong>, it can be used</p>

<ul>
<li>to confirm a high suspicion for the disease (due to typical clinical
presentation for example)</li>
<li>to exclude possible other diseases when the clinical diagnosis is unclear</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>None of the current dignostic criteria for AD or PD rely solely on neuroimaging studies.</strong></p>

<p>There are some signs on MRI scan which <strong>may indicate</strong> the presence of AD or PD but patients with advanced stages of the disease may show limited signs of the diseases on MRI.</p>

<p>In <strong>AD</strong>, patients typically present hippocampal atropy (craked walnut sign, see image below) or medio temporal atrophy. However, as hippocampal atrophy is also present with age, some age-specific criteria are needed to differentiate between a age-related hippocampal atrophy and an AD-related hippocampal atrophy. Other signs may be present such as white matter anomalies. But these signs do not correlate necessarily with the severity of the disease.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZWYz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZWYz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In PD, the role of MRI is very limited and is mainly used to help when a differential diagnosis for the symptoms is present. It can also help diagnosing between an idiopathic PD or a vascular PD for example (if signs of cerebrovascular diseases are present on the MRI).</p>

<p>Recently, <strong>advanced techniques of neuroimaging</strong> (non exhaustive list: functional brain imaging with [18F] FDG-PET, functional MRI (fMRI), perfusion MRI, SPECT, amyloid PET tracers (F18-florbetapir, F18-flutemetamol, F18-florbetaben) in AD and MR spectroscopy (MRS), magnetization transfer imaging, diffusion-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, and high-resolution imaging (eg, MRI at 7 Tesla) for PD) have been suggested to help in the diagnosis of AD and PD. However, most of the studies rely on a small number of patients so further studies including a larger sample size are needed to confirm the encouraging results.</p>

"What are the effects of routine and daily meditation and physical exercise on pregnancy?","111","","<p>There are various studies with supporting data on <strong>what not to do</strong> during pregnancy, with many actions and/or situations that can negatively impact the growing human during pregnancy. </p>

<p>However, I am looking for studies on <strong>what to do</strong>, for achieving more optimal and positive benefits, on a developing human during pregnancy.</p>

<p>To narrow down this question better for this site's format:</p>

<p>I'm interested to know; what are the effects on a developing human during pregnancy, when the mother performs a routine and daily meditation practice, in addition to a daily and routine aerobic and anaerobic physical exercise practice (say most days of pregnancy, like weekdays).</p>

<p>To add context, this can be contrasted to the differences in pregnancy styles, as asked in <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/22056/will-a-mothers-crazy-work-hours-affect-child-development-in-the-womb"">this</a> question. Here the mother's priority is stressful work, on most days of pregnancy.</p>

<p>If there are other items that are notable for positive outcomes, please do mention them. </p>

<p>*Note: This is non-religious meditation, with focus on mindfulness, self-awareness, etc.</p>
","<p>I wasn't able to find a study that looked at both meditation and exercise - besides ones about yoga - but I was able to find many that looked at each separately and seemed to indicate that combining the two is simple and effective.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>One of the best sources was a thesis by Nikelle Holbrook Hunsaker entitled <a href=""http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/honors/105/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>""The Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy""</strong></a> (pdf <a href=""http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1119&amp;context=honors"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). It is a meta-analysis of other studies in the literature. Some do not fit your criteria (e.g. some looked at exercise three times a week but not daily), but given that most recommendations do not include physical activity seven days a week, I've mentioned some here.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Boinpally &amp; Jovanovic (2009)</strong> wrote that 30 minutes of physical activity (aerobic or anaerobic) five a days a week before and during pregnancy greatly reduces the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM directly affects the mother, but can easily lead to side effects in the child. Preventing GDM can reduce the risk of such conditions as macrosomia and congenital diseases. This conclusion agrees with the results of <strong>Liu et al. (2008)</strong>.</li>
<li>A similar exercise program can reduce the risk of type II diabetes, according to <strong>Kim et al. (2010)</strong>. This makes sense, because of the similarities between GDM and type II diabetes.</li>
<li>In general, exercise can decrease the risk of preeclampsia, which can cause the death of the mother and of the fetus. <strong>Sorensen et al. (2008)</strong> found that regular recreational exercise reduced the risk of preeclampsia. The greater the intensity of the exercise, the lower the chances of preeclampsia.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thesis discussed and/or cited other studies, but most did not match your criteria. Some involved one-time physical activity.</p></li>
<li><a href=""http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7674866"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Sternfield et al. (1995)</strong></a> divided a group of 388 women up into four levels depending on the amount of exercise they got on a weekly basis (the highest group involved aerobic activity for at least 3 20-minutes+ sessions per week). They found no difference in the effect of exercise on the children, but did notice that the mothers experienced reduced pain and discomfort.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603201"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>May et al. (2015)</strong></a> noted that regular exercise during pregnancy lowered heart rate and reduced symptoms from related disorders. However, they recommended that more research be done on the relation between exercise and certain other conditions.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.hss.edu/conditions_exercise-during-pregnancy.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>A page from the Hospital for Special Surgery</strong></a> gives a variety of recommendations regarding exercise during pregnancy:

<ul>
<li>Athletes can continue to exercise during the first trimester, with no adverse effects.</li>
<li>Aquatic aerobics reduce joint stress and fluid retention.</li>
<li>Multiple activities should be used to reduce stress if the mother exercises more than four days per week (this might explain why most studies don't cover daily exercise).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>

(2012)</strong></a> is a meta-analysis of studies from the PubMed database from 1970 to 2011. The results were not entirely conclusive, but the studies found two results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Women who regularly (frequencies varied) performed yoga during pregnancy enjoyed reduced pain/discomfort throughout pregnancy.</li>
<li>Babies of women who regularly preformed yoga during pregnancy had a slightly higher birth weight - nothing serious or significant, though.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26256135"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Davis et al. (2015)</strong></a> found that an eight-week yoga intervention greatly reduced depression and anxiety in women with depression, supporting the idea that yoga and meditation reduce anxiety.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873115"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Oakley &amp; Evans (2014)</strong></a> state that breathing exercises and meditation increase maternal relaxation.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Yoga is perhaps the most studied of all the meditation regimens out there. Indeed, a considerable number of the studies I looked at focused on the meditative component of yoga. This type of exercise should also be compatible with aerobic/anaerobic exercise, even for pregnant women. However, it is clear that during a pregnancy, women should be careful when it comes to exercise.</p>

<p>To summarize the main findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exercise can reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes, and preeclampsia, as well as general pain and discomfort from the pregnancy.</li>
<li>Meditation/yoga can reduce pain, discomfort, and stress levels.</li>

"When is a stomach ""empty"" for the purpose of taking medication?","111","","<p>Some medication (certain antibiotics, thyroxine, PPIs) need to be taken on an ""empty stomach"". For most patients, that just means they take them after sleeping. However, certain circumstances can lead to that not being feasible. </p>

<p>How long after the last meal should these drugs generally be taken to be sure? </p>
","<p>In my experience most anesthesiologists use 5 hours as the minimum time necessary for the stomach to be sufficiently empty to make it safe to administer anesthesia. However, their criteria is quite stringent because the consequences of the stomach not actually being empty can be severe (aspiration of vomit). </p>

<p>The National Health Service (UK) offers <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/861.aspx?categoryid=73&amp;subcategoryid=103"" rel=""nofollow"">this guideline</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a general rule, medicines that are supposed to be taken on an empty
  stomach should be taken about an hour before a meal, or two hours
  after a meal.</p>

<p>I've seen that guideline used in medication instructions so I believe it is widely accepted.</p>

"Does cooking food prevent the body from efficiently absorbing minerals?","110","","<p>It is true that we absorb minerals from cooked food less efficiently, because the membranes of our cells are made up mostly of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_ion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hydrogen ions</a>, therefore cooking food lose its anionic charge and it become more cationic? So in other words, it makes the food less healthy?</p>

<p>This can be demonstrated by Kirlian photography of cooked food which capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOmsl.png"" alt=""Kirlian photography, cooked food""></p>

<p><sup>Image found at: <a href=""http://thetaoofdana.com/post/74865712793/the-energy-of-your-food-dramatically-affects-your"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Tao of Dana</a></sup></p>

<p>Which gives the impression of reduction of anionic charge. Therefore if alkalinity is altered due to cooking, it could influence the structural, functional and enzymatic aspects of the food making the nutritions less absorbable.</p>
","<p>Cell membranes are made out of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid"">phospholipids</a> and a lot of proteins, not of hydrogen ions. A membrane of hydrogen ions doesn't make any sense chemically in any way.</p>

<p>Cooking doesn't change the overall charge of molecules in food, you can't create or destroy charges out of thin air. To change the charges, essentially the pH of your solution, you need to either add acid or base. Of course you do that quite often in cooking, but the cooking process itself can't change any charges by itself. And even if it did, stomach acid has a very low pH and will change the charges of food anyway. </p>

<p>The Kirlian photography is pretty, but that's it. The strength of the effect is <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/194/4262/263"">sensitive to moisture</a> for example, there are all kinds of reasons why cooked and raw food could look differently in these images. </p>

"How does forehead cooling affect me?","110","","<p>Sometimes I have headaches. I've heard that they're caused by the pressure of veins in my brain (not anything more). I found out that if I cool my forehead or eyelids with water, the pain stops.</p>

<p>Am I actually healing the cause or just cloaking the symptoms?</p>

<p>(It does not hurry, I'm just interested ;)</p>
","<p>You are possibly reducing some of the causes of the symptoms, but for numerous reasons and maybe a secondary diagnosis the headaches themselves may return. Head cooling is a typical treatment for headaches and migraines.</p>

  <p>Ice packs have a
  numbing effect, which may dull the sensation of pain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heat works as well. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hot packs and  heating pads can relax tense muscles. Warm showers or baths may have a
  similar effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.excedrin.com/migraines/treatment/ice-pack-for-migraines/"" rel=""nofollow"">How it works possibly:</a></p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>It is thought that cold constricts the blood vessels (a process known
  as vasoconstriction), possibly creating decreased downstream blood
  flow and lessening the pain you may feed. A cold pack may also reduce
  edema (swelling).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>The potential neurologic effects of cold therapy on migraine may be
  rooted in the fact that the cold inhibits your ability to feel the
  pain, a process called analgesia.</p>

<p>So applying cold is not just masking the symptoms, but may also be working at the root of the problem. </p>

"Inferring vitamin D level from levels of parathyroid hormone, vitamin B6 and calcium","110","","<p>Given a blood test that contains the levels of parathyroid hormone, vitamin B6 and calcium, how to infer the level of vitamin D?</p>
","<p>Exposure to adequate sunlight is a better predictor of vitamin D levels than PTH, B6, and calcium.  It's unlikely that a solid enough correlation exists between those and D.  If you're rarely exposed to sunlight wearing bathing suit attire during peak UVB hours (11am - 1pm in most of North America), and you also don't take a supplemental form, you're very likely to be on the low side, if not outright deficient.  </p>

<p>The only way to know for sure is to have your 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels checked via bloodworm.  If you like, you can <a href=""http://www.grassrootshealth.net/daction"" rel=""nofollow"">go here</a> to participate in a study that will let you measure your levels a couple times a year for 60 dollars.  </p>

<p>Vitamin D is arguably the most important vitamin to supplement with for most people in developed countries.  Now being called a 'master hormone' by some researchers, it controls over 10% of the human genome through epigenetic influences.  Correction of vitamin D levels has been associated with improvements in a wide variety of illnesses, from depression to autoimmune disorders to hormonal imbalances.  </p>

<p>Optimal dosage is anywhere from 5,000 ius per day to as high as 20,000 ius for some people, though this is excessive for most.  </p>

"Are PCOS & endometriosis linked? How to know if menstrual pain is atypical to warrant testing?","109","","<p>I was diagnosed with PCOS about 5 years ago and take Metformin for it (although the symptoms are still at large). But lately, despite taking birth control, my period causes me an immense amount of fatigue both the week before and during, causes an extreme amount of heavy bleeding that last for about 7 days, and of course comes with abdominal pains (cramping, bloating, diarrhea), but the worst is the vicious nausea and vomiting. Occassionally, I get two periods a month, which means I'm sick the entire month. Are these symptoms of PCOS or could it also be related to endometriosis? </p>

<p>If you have PCOS are you more likely to have endometriosis? </p>

<p>How do you know if your pain is atypical? Because all women suffer from their periods, and it's a pain for everyone so I don't want to appear like a hypochondriac if I approach my doctor about this (because I do have a lot of other conditions).</p>

<p>While doing an ultrasound for something else, they did note that I had an anteverted uterus (but I don't think that's worrisome), but also that I had a 2.2 x 2 cm cyst on my right ovary. The report said it was benign, but that seems awfully large and could be causing me a lot of pain? Is that normal? And how do they know it's benign? Is this all PCOS stuff or is it endometriosis too? </p>
","<p><em>I think your question contains many personal parts which I can't answer and should be addressed by your gynaecologist. However, I will try to bring some clarifications to some of your raised issues:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If you have PCOS are you more likely to have endometriosis?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, two studies have investigated this.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2797642"" rel=""nofollow"">first study</a> was conducted in 1989 and included 91 women. Here the results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pelvic endometriosis was observed in 15 of 91 women (16.5%) with
  laparoscopically confirmed polycystic ovary syndrome.</strong> There were no
  significant clinical differences among those with and those without
  endometriosis. The groups were of similar age, parity, and ponderal
  indices and had similar incidences of oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, and
  infertility; the serum concentrations of LH, FSH, LH/FSH, prolactin,
  testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were also similar in
  each group. However, <strong>women with polycystic ovaries and endometriosis
  presented more frequently with regular menses (40 versus 14.5%; P =
  .05) and less frequently with secondary amenorrhea (0 versus 38.2%; P
  = .05) and galactorrhea (0 versus 9.2%; P = .05) than the women with polycystic ovaries alone.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors concluded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Endometriosis <strong>appears to be a coincidental finding in polycystic ovary
  syndrome, and its development does not modify significantly the
  clinical picture or biochemical profiles of these patients. However,
  menstrual patterns seem to be affected.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, <a href=""http://www.j-endometriosis.com/article/coexistence-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-and-endometriosis-in-women-with-infertility"" rel=""nofollow"">a second study</a>, conducted in 2014, reported *a significant association between endometriosis and women with PCOS with pelvic pain and/or infertility.</p>

<p><strong>So to conclude: while a causal link has still to be determined, presence of endometriosis and PCOS is not uncommon. The latter study showed an odds ratio of 19.7 (95% CI, 9.6-40.2) of finding endometriosis in PCOS (p&lt;0.0001)</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Now the <strong>diagnosis of PCOS relies on the Rotterdam criteria</strong> ie two out of three of the following are required to make the diagnosis: oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.</p>

<p>While the <strong>diagnosis of endometriosis relies on histologic evaluation of a lesion biopsied during surgery</strong> (typically laparoscopy).</p>

<p>As a side note, according to uptodate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is often delayed because the
  <strong>symptoms of endometriosis are vague</strong>, the symptoms overlap with a
  number of gynecological and gastrointestinal processes, and a surgical
  diagnosis entails risk. Studies have reported an average diagnostic
  delay of 7 to 12 years in women with endometriosis.</p>

<p>Were these ranges constructed based off established science connecting these numbers to health, or are the ranges arbitrary?  If they are based off peer reviewed research could you please provide as much detail as possible.</p>
","<p>Generally, for determining normal range of any parameter, a reasonably large sample of apparently healthy population is tested for that parameter. The normal range is then taken to be 2.5th to 97.5th percentile value. Values above and below this range are categorized as abnormal (abnormally low or high). </p>

<p>For some parameters, e.g. eyesight, one side of range is better than normal and may be called super-normal and not abnormal.</p>

<p>Round, convenient values are often taken as limits of normal ranges and mild/moderate/severe categories, so that they can be easily remembered and applied in busy clinics. Some of the blood sugar, blood pressure and BMI cutoffs follow this principle. </p>

<p>For some parameters, prospective studies of outcome (life expectancy, morbidity and mortality) may show a particular range to be the best or optimal and such range may be used to determine normality. Yu Chen et al (<a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5446</a>) found a U shaped association between BMI of Asians and cardiovascular deaths.</p>

<p>How does caffeine block the adenosine receptors? How does it stimulate the autonomic nervous system?</p>
","<p>Caffeine is an antagonist at adenosine receptors 1 and 2A. This means it binds to said receptors without activating them. The presence of caffeine at the adenosine receptors prevents adenosine (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) from binding (and producing a response), thereby causing stimulation (1) . This activity also induces neurotransmitter release (2) .</p>

<p>Caffeine is structurally similar to adenosine. (3) This underlies it ability to bind to the same receptors. </p>

Later, that day while I was cleaning my nose, I realized air goes out. It can hear as well as my other ear, but when I use headphones it has no sensitivity to bass sounds. My question is, can my ear repair itself? Or should I have a small surgery? Are there any other options?</p>
","<p>Perforated eardrums (or ruptured tympanic membranes) are a problem older than mankind. The majority of cases (reported/observed, ~80%) heal spontaneously with little residual hearing loss or other problems, usually in a few weeks.</p>

<p>It is acceptable practice, therefore, to only observe traumatic TM perforations for healing.</p>

<p>If you are still experiencing hearing loss, however, you should see an ear specialist (ear, nose and throat if in the US). They will determine if your hearing loss is due to a chronic perforation (one that has not healed itself), or middle-ear bone damage (or another possible cause) which occurred during the traumatic event. In most cases, there are surgical treatments. If the perforation is still present, a simple patch may be all that's needed. If a bone was injured, the surgery (bone repair or replacement) is more involved. Other injuries are treated dependent on case.</p>

<p>Edited to add: During healing, care should be taken to keep water out of the ear (no swimming; baths or showers with protection from water in ear), and, though I have not seen a study on it, I would recommend against headphones except at a very low volume. The healing membrane isn't as tough as the original. </p>

"What are effective lifestyle modifications for people with gastric acid reflux?","109","","<p>As many as 7% of Americans suffer from heartburn every day, and many more suffer it at least weekly. In the ""old days"", people with heartburn were advised to eat smaller meals, drink less alcohol, smoke less, eat less ""spicy foods"", avoid chocolate, coffee, acidic (e.g.citrus) drinks, and more; for symptomatic relief, antacids were prescribed. In the case of <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/basics/definition/con-20030640"">hiatal hernias</a>, elevation of the head of the bed was the most common recommendation.</p>

<p>Now we have proton pump inhibitors that lower gastric acid secretion, which takes care of the symptoms of a large number of sufferers, not to mention newer drugs affecting lower esophageal pressure, etc. But drugs are not without side effects.</p>

<p>In this age of evidence-based medicine, what lifestyle modifications have been shown to really help gastric acid reflux symptoms or GERD? </p>
","<p>It sounds like you know that some lifestyle modifications have been shown to be beneficial with patients who have mild to moderate GERD and that these interventions are typically preferable to pharmacological intervention.  Right on!</p>

<p>The definitive information on management of GERD can be found on <a href=""http://gi.org/guideline/diagnosis-and-managemen-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">the website of the American College of Gastroenterology</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the specific section that you're looking for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Weight loss is recommended for GERD patients who are overweight or have had recent weight gain. (Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence).</p></li>
<li><p>Head of bed elevation and avoidance of meals 2–3 h before bedtime should be recommended for patients with nocturnal GERD. (Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence).</p></li>
<li><p>Routine global elimination of food that can trigger reflux (including chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, acidic and/or spicy foods) is not recommended in the treatment of GERD. (Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In my personal experience, all three of these are worth trying.</p>

"Does sweat expel toxins?","108","","<p>The internet is full of websites and people saying ""sweating is a good way to expel toxins.""  An example is <a href=""http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-15166/why-sweating-is-the-best-way-to-get-rid-of-toxins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a>.</p>

<p>What is the truth behind this claim?</p>

<p>For the scope of this question, toxins include substances like chemicals and heavy metals. And from Wikipedia ""In the context of alternative medicine the term is often used to refer to any substance claimed to cause ill health, ranging anywhere from trace amounts of pesticides to common food items like refined sugar or additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG).""</p>

<p>Given the large amount of toxins, I just want to know if sweating can expel <strong>any</strong> toxin at all.</p>
","<p>The generally accepted medical wisdom seems to be that sweat is an insignificant mechanism for toxin elimination. However, there have been studies that suggest that wisdom may not be entirely correct.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213291"" rel=""nofollow"">Genuis et al.</a> found that some toxic elements were preferentially excreted in sweat, including elements that were not found in blood serum. That suggests those elements are bound in tissues and therefore not readily removed by the liver and kidneys. </p>

<p>They conclude that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sweat analysis should be considered as an additional method for
  monitoring bioaccumulation of toxic elements in humans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that they do <strong>not</strong> conclude that sweating plays a significant role in toxin elimination. </p>

<p>Note also that the sample size in this study was very small, and the author has numerous publications based on this single study.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2012/184745/"" rel=""nofollow"">literature review</a> of the subject found support for the idea that certain toxins are excreted in sweat, sometimes in higher concentrations than urine. They also noted as Genuis did that concentrations of some elements can be found in sweat that aren't detected in plasma.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In individuals with higher exposure or body burden, sweat generally
  exceeded plasma or urine concentrations, and dermal could match or
  surpass urinary daily excretion. Arsenic dermal excretion was
  severalfold higher in arsenic-exposed individuals than in unexposed
  controls. Cadmium was more concentrated in sweat than in blood plasma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I cannot find is research showing that sweating produces any clinically significant benefit. Just because a compound can be found in sweat does not necessarily mean that sweating more will have a beneficial effect, and in fact no benefit to excessive sweating is known while there are known negative consequences, including potentially lethal ones.</p>

<p>I conclude from my research that the question can't be answered at this time, but there is sufficient evidence to justify additional research. I suspect that the most likely outcome will be new and/or improved testing methods rather than treatment methods.</p>

"Does tea cause gags?","107","","<p>It's been a personal experience. I am at home now and take tea twice a day. For 2 months now I have been having acidity problems, which, my doctor told me, were the main reason I have been getting gags the whole day. I had quit taking tea <em>ceterus paribus</em> and have noticed that frequency of getting gags has <strong>drastically reduced</strong>. I am curious: can tea or any particular component of it cause acidity which eventually causes people to feel like retching?</p>
","<p>I haven't found any studies that would directly link retching and the consumption of tea. However, this would be a rather narrow research, so the lack of it is no surprise. Your doctor told you that your acidity problems may be caused by tea and that this might be causing your gags, and they are correct.</p>

<p>It has been proven that consumption of tea is directly related to increased secretion of gastric acid (1):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The gastric acid response to a 200-ml cup of tea was measured [...] Tea resulted in an acid secretory response which was almost equal to that after a maximal dose (0.04 mg/kg) of histamine. The effect of tea was mainly due to its local chemical action on gastric mucosa. Tea without milk and sugar resulted in an acid response higher than that evoked by a maximal dose of histamine. The concentration of tea brew that had the greatest effect on gastric acid secretion was 15 g/200 ml, which was three times as much as that in a palatable cup of tea. Tea is a potent stimulant of gastric acid, and this can be reduced by adding milk and sugar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This effect of tea is most likely caused by caffeine, which was proven to increase gastric secretion in animals and humans. (2, 3)</p>

<p>Therefore tea can have some adverse effects (4):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Green tea and green tea extracts contain caffeine. Caffeine can cause insomnia, anxiety, irritability, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, or frequent urination in some people.</em></p>
</blockquote>

"Water and wrinkled skin. Is being under water for long dangerous?","106","","<p>After spending extended time in a bath, humans develop wrinkled skin. <strong>Is wrinkled skin the only effect of the immersion?</strong> Could a human spend extended time periods in water without causing some permanent damage? For sake of the question, let's say 7 days, or a month.</p>
","<p>Wrinkling is an adaptative response of the skin, allowing for better grasp on objects when the skin is wet. The skin is a barrier of stacked cells mostly made of keratin and lipids. It is covered in aqueous and oily secretions (sweat, sebum) containing salts, acids, peptides, squalene, steroids, etc, as well as bacteria forming a biofilm and that defend you against pathogens. </p>

<p>If you are soaking continuously in water, these components are being washed away. One problem I immediately think of is fungal infection. 
Also, in warm water the skin is only semi-permeable, which is the basis of balneotherapy (absorbing minerals through the skin).</p>

<p>With time, water would disrupt the statum corneum, making the skin permeable, resulting in irritations, ulcerations, infections, loss of electrolytes, etc. </p>

<p>Look up ""trench foot"" or ""immersion syndrome"" , eg.  <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1999.tb06990.x/abstract;jsessionid=A71258961B2A73795CF1A2282A8AFB26.f02t02"" rel=""nofollow"">How irritant is water?

"How to lose water weight? Or prevent water retention?","105","","<p>Lately, I have been feeling very bloated and it appears that my body is retaining water extensively. Although I know water weight is only a couple of pounds -- I find that it is very noticeable. <strong>Is there a way to prevent water-retention or lose water weight?</strong> I know that sodium is a big culprit for water-retention so I've been cutting it out completely, but it doesn't seem to budge. <strong>Are there other ways to lose water-weight?</strong> </p>
","<p>For a healthy individual there are 2 main ways to lose water weight:</p>

<ul>
<li>To decrease sodium intake (this may take several days to become effective).</li>
<li>A low-carb diet that results in ketosis (in as little as 2 days). This means that you burn all glycogen you have in the liver and muscles. If you have 500 grams of glycogen stores and if each gram of glycogen can bind up to 4 grams of water (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-1716.1970.tb04764.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">Wiley Online</a>), you can lose 2,000 grams (~4 pounds) of water. I'm not saying I recommend this.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other cause of ""bloating"" is abdominal fat.</p>

<p>The other real cause of abdominal bloating (abdominal distension) is excessive production of gas in the bowel. This usually occurs after consumption of foods high in soluble fiber (oats, legumes, fruits and some vegetables) (<a href=""http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic_Gas"" rel=""nofollow"">Cleveland Clinic</a>) or after drinking milk (in people with lactose intolerance) or consumption of fructose (in those with fructose malabsorption).

</ul>

<p>That's a bit of an overreaction to what these studies found. </p>

<p>Study 2 found that in mice, cinammon bark extract led to the formation of less aggregates of amyloid beta proteins, something that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. The mice also showed improvement in cognitive function. Mice are often used as model organism's in Alzheimer's studies, because we have transgenic mice that show symptoms of nerve degeneration. For some reason, this research used a different strain of mice that shows nerve degeneration as early as two months. Usually in Alzheimer's studies in mice, another strain is used that shows symptoms much later. That doesn't need to be a bad thing, just something I found interesting. The authors are optimistic about their study, but do recommend caution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These characteristics could be a disadvantage for evaluating drug candidates that are moderately efficacious and could be overlooked when tested in such an aggressive model, as opposed to the common more moderate models which may recapitulate the slower progression of AD in humans. However, (...) dramatically improved their cognitive performance suggests that CEppt may be likewise effective in the more typical AD mice models and in human patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other study, which from what I found received even more press attention, was an <em>in vitro</em> study, so done on cells in a laboratory. In that setting, compounds found in cinnamon reduced the formation of aggregates of the protein tau, which is also involved in the <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrn/posters/ad/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">formation of Alzheimer's</a>. </p>

<p>Basically, both studies suggest that some ingredients in cinammon can reduce two factors that we believe are involved in how Alzheimer's Disease progresses : 
accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide, and formation of  neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein. </p>

<p>It's promising, but so far, no study in humans has been done and we can't say for certain whether these compounds can slow down or even halt the progression of Alzheimer's. We especially can't say in what doses an effect would occur. </p>

So he is  going to treat me as if I have endometriosis. Looking at my medical history (all the pain/vomiting/nausea/PCOS, but yet having a clear Colonoscopy and Endoscopic Ultrasound and no food allergies) in addition to pressing on trigger points on my abdomen and inside cervix, he believes I have endometriosis.</p>

<p>He believes that endometriosis may be contributing to my fatigue, extreme nausea, abdominal pain, migraines, digestive issues, etc. So to solve that he wants to insert an IUD into my uterus in two weeks. You can read about general IUDs <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Basically, it's a contraceptive that is inserted directly inside me. But it should help with all the symptoms associated with my period by getting rid of my period. It can last for up to 5 years. I can remove it (if I ever were to try and have kids). He thinks this is far superior to treating my pain than regular birth control. </p>

<p>The one he wants me on is called Mirena. You can read about it <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mirena/basics/definition/prc-20012867"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

<p><em>Wolf P. The role of nonpharmaceutic conservative interventions in the treatment and secondary prevention of epilepsy. Epilepsia. 2002;43 Suppl 9:2-5.</em> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12383271"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></p>

<p>It says (I have kept the essential parts):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The first step is the identification of factors facilitating the
  occurrence of seizures. In the second step, strategies to control
  these factors are developed.</strong> Most common are disturbances of the
  sleep-wake cycle, especially reduction of sleep. <strong>Patients should
  follow a regular sleep schedule with deviations of not >2 h.</strong> Sometimes
  a sleep calendar is helpful. Night shifts are not compatible with
  seizure prevention in these cases. (...) O<strong>ther nonspecific
  facilitators of seizures include uncontrolled use of alcohol and
  extraordinary stress. Patients must learn how to cope with stressful
  events.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also provides some preventive measures for specific types of epilepsies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In <strong>reflex epilepsies</strong>, specific precipitants of seizures are the
  targets of interventions. Thus, most patients with primary reading
  epilepsy begin to have, with prolonged reading, perioral reflex
  myoclonias, which enable them to stop reading and thus to avoid a GTC
  seizure. In <strong>photosensitive patients</strong>, seizures are often precipitated
  by television. These can be avoided by viewing from a distance and
  using a remote control, small screens in a well-lit room, and
  preferably with a 100-Hz line shift. Environmental flicker stimulation
  often comes unexpectedly, and it is advisable that the patients always
  wear sunglasses in brightly lighted surroundings. Polarized glasses
  seem to be more protective than plain sunglasses. <strong>If the patient has
  only photically induced seizures</strong>, treatment by specific prevention
  alone may be sufficient, but if spontaneous seizures also occur, drugs
  must be given in addition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

"Taking Supplements - space out my Vitamin A? And the others?","104","","<p>Each day I take a multi-vitamin and a cod liver oil tablet (along with creatine and L-Glutamine). Both of these tablets claim to contain 100% RDA (Recommended Daily Amount) of Vitamin A. I take these last thing at night (except the creatine which is before/after workout).</p>

<p>I believe that too much Vitamin A is not good for you, and going above the RDA by twice as much of anything probably isn't a good idea. But there is no way to avoid it as both capsules have 100% RDA.</p>

<p>Am I risking damaging my kidneys by giving them too much Vitamin A to process in one go? Should I take the cod liver oil in the morning, and the multivitamin in the evening? Or vice-versa?</p>
","<p>Unless you're doing something stupid like eating polar bear liver, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_A"" rel=""noreferrer"">hypervitaminosis A</a> is the result of long-term overconsumption: taking one supplement in the morning and one in the evening is no more or less dangerous than taking both at once.</p>

<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, the level of <a href=""http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h8"" rel=""noreferrer"">vitamin A overconsumption</a> that presents a long-term risk to a healthy adult depends on the form that the vitamin is consumed in.  For pre-formed vitamin A (retinoids), the upper level is about three times the RDA, while for vitamin-A precursors (carotenoids), there is no known toxic effect for overconsumption, though it may raise the lung cancer risk of smoking or working with asbestos.</p>

"What are some health consequences of low cholesterol?","104","","<p>I was told about low cholesterol in an off-handed comment by my doctor while he was inspecting an FBT for the cellulitis I am treating that low cholesterol is bad for you.</p>

<p>Is this true? Is it bad to have low cholesterol?</p>
","<p>In the following, I assume you meant total cholesterol and not HDL or LDL-cholesterol. </p>

<p>Low cholesterol can be found in some rare genetic diseases, and in people affected by other illnesses. For example, hyperthyroidism will cause low cholesterol because it fastens the metabolism and increases the use of lipids in general. Any illness that involves inflammation will be likely to lower the cholesterol blood level as well. </p>

<p>People affected by metabolic disorders and who have to follow a strict diet (especially hypoprotidic ones, like phenylcetonuria) will often have low cholesterol.</p>

<p>Additionally, children often have low cholesterol because cells use cholesterol to expand and multiply, and the growth period therefore use a lot of cholesterol.</p>

<p>As for the risks associated with low cholesterol, there is still little research on the subject. Low cholesterol seem to be a bad prognosis factor for severely ill patients, and associated with stroke, infections or mental illnesses. However, it is unclear if the cholesterol level is just a marker of the risk (a consequence) or a cause.</p>

<p>Like all biological factors, it'd be probably interesting to do another test to see if this low cholesterol happened just once or if it's a trend. Since you're being treated for cellulitis, it's likely that this infection is responsible for your current low cholesterol (which would be confirmed if your cholesterol returns to normal after treatment). </p>

<p>Sadly I can't be more precise than this answer as there is, as far as I know, no specific study on cholesterol levels in people treated for cellulitis.</p>

"What type of liver is richest in Vitamin D?","104","","<p>My test reports show that my Vitamin D - 25H (Hydroxyvitamin D) is <strong>6.16 ng/ml</strong> whereas the normal range is <strong>30 - 100 ng/ml</strong>.</p>

<p>So, I read a few articles (e.g. <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d_deficiency/article.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">medicinenet</a>, <a href=""https://patient.info/in/health/vitamin-d-deficiency-including-osteomalacia-and-rickets-leaflet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">patient.info</a>) on the internet and they said that liver is a good source of Vitamin D.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, which liver i.e. chicken, lamb, beef etc is best for me?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The older the animal, the greater the amount of vitamin D stored in the liver. While liver is a <em>somewhat</em> good source of vitamin D, it's also <strong>very</strong> high in vitamin A. A person eating liver  more often than once or twice a week could possibly overload on vitamin A. Especially in the amount youd need to correct a vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin A is toxic in larger amounts.</p>

<p>Just one serving of 100 grams of beef liver contains 26,000 IU of vitamin A. 100 grams is roughly the size of a woman's palm. The US Institute of Medicine gives an upper limit of 3,000 IU of vitamin A per day. Vitamin D content in beef liver, however, is only 49 IU. The USDA Nutrient Database doesn't even list vitamin D in chicken or lamb liver.</p>

<p>Why not take vitamin D tablets? They're available as D3 (cholecalciferol) and it's converted to calcitriol, the active metabolive used in the body. It's inexpensive and the dose can be better controlled than by eating liver. Your doctor would be best suggesting how much D to take. </p>

"Could we cure HIV through transplantation of white blood cells resistant to HIV?","103","","<p>So, I came across following website (<a href=""http://www.delta-32.com/ccr5-delta32.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delta-32.com/ccr5-delta32.html</a>) talking about these 1% of the population being resistant to HIV. </p>

<p>According to this website</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The virus HIV normally enters a cell via its CCR5 receptors,
  especially in the initial stage of a person becoming infected. But in
  people with receptors crippled by the CCR5-delta32 mutation, entry of
  HIV by this means is blocked, providing resistance to HIV for people
  with delta 32 mutation on both genes (called homozygous carriers) and
  greatly slowing progress of the disease in people with a delta 32
  mutation on one of the two genes (called heterozygous carriers).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my question is whether it would be possible to take those cells from HIV resistant people and ""transplant"" them to patients with HIV?</p>

<p>I am probably missing a point (I am not a biologist) and I apologise in advance if the question is silly.</p>
","<p>This is not a silly question. While <strong>transfusing white blood cells</strong>, with the CCR5 mutation <strong>isn't a solution</strong> because these cells will be rejected by the recipient's body (and also because those cells have a limited life time), <strong>transplantation of so called ""stem cells"" have provided promising results</strong> in HIV+ patients with blood cancer undergoing stem cell transplantation. </p>

<p>So to summarise (the protocol is quite complicated but since you mentioned you are not in the biomedical field, I will try to explain it in a simple way), these patients receive an ablative chemotherapy (+/- total body irradiation) in order to destroy all their ""cancerous"" cells. They then get transplanted with stem cells from a donor which has the CCR5-delta32 mutation. These cells then replace the previous population of white blood cells (which have been killed during the ablative phase) leading transplanted individuals to become HIV resistant. </p>

<p><em>So, now, you must wonder while this has not been more used?</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Because this method is very <strong>toxic</strong> and <strong>associated with several complications</strong> (ex: patients undergoing this high risk ablative therapy are at risk of developing infections during the process as their immune cells get destroyed)</li>
<li>Patients need to take immunsuppresive therapy for a long time to avoid rejection of the transplanted stem cells and theses drugs are also associated with side effects</li>
<li>Studies have still to show whether this method is at least as effective (in terms of short and long term outcomes) as taking HIV drugs (which become more and more efficient) in <strong>healthy individuals</strong> (remember that this method was used in HIV+ patients with blood cells cancer, who, anyway, needed a chemotherapy)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this provides some clarification to your question!</p>

"How does resting influence the recovery time of a common cold?","103","","<p>It seems to be self-evident: If I have a cold, I stay at home, snug under my bed cover, drink a lot of tea and either sleep and let myself be distracted by a book or a movie, until I don’t feel weak anymore.</p>

<p>But is there evidence that this actually speeds up the recovery? To what extent? Is it only necessary to rest physically (e.g. stay in bed, but do work there), or should I relax completely for a quick recover?</p>
","<p>There is no evidence to suggest that rest has any influence on rate of recovery. However, fluids do help. </p>

<p>There are almost no 'cures' for common cold. However, a variety of remedies do work to lessen the symptoms that we are only too well aware of (malaise, aches, fatigue, irritation, etc). And these remedies are not universal. People have sets of highly personalised and mostly diet based remedies that seem to take the edge off the unpleasantness associated with cold. </p>

<p>Hot teas, tea with lemon and/or honey, chicken soup have all been documented anecdotally to contribute to early recovery.
And like your own experience, taking rest and your mind off the cold do helps 'hasten' time before you get well again. </p>

"Is combining silicone plasters and silicone gels for scars effective?","103","","<p>I have a question. As far as I know, <strong>silicone gels</strong> and <strong>silicone plasters (aka sheets or patches)</strong> are used to optimize wound healing and minimize scarring. I purchased a silicone plaster <strong><em>Mepiform</em></strong> and silicone gel <strong><em>Strataderm</em></strong> against the scars. </p>

<hr>

<p>Can they be used <strong>simultaneously</strong> to enhance their positive effect? That is, first you put the silicone gel on skin, let it dry and then on top of the dried gel you attach silicone plaster. </p>

<p>Will it be more effective?</p>
","<p>There are many factors that can determine how well an individual will heal and scar. While many treatments have been suggested for the treatment of scars, only a few of them have been supported by prospective studies with an adequate control group. As a result, the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids remains an unsolved problem in the process of wound healing. An abstract titled, ‘<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9810992?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The use of silicone occlusive sheeting (Sil-K) and silicone occlusive gel (Epiderm) in the prevention of hypertrophic scar formation</a>' confirms,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this reason, a successful treatment to prevent excessive scar formation still has yet to be found. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, as it relates to the <em>effectiveness</em> of topical scar treatments -- there isn't one particular type that is <em>completely effective</em>. The potential for achieving results from a topical scar treatment is usually dependent on the age, thickness, and location of the scar. </p>

<p>However, clinical support of topical gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the ""internationally recommended first-line form of scar management"", though there continues to be ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. '<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486716/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Use of Silicone Adhesives for Scar Reduction</a>' explains,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas occlusion and hydration may also be achieved by other scar care products, '<a href=""http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2989813;jsessionid=B8FC345F5F30BF514B5D53722310AA86"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">An Evaluation of Evidence Regarding Application of Silicone Gel Sheeting for the Management of Hypertrophic Scars and Keloids</a>' recognizes the benefits of silicone gel sheeting, stating it   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…has been clinically proven to also address pruritus, skin pigmentation changes, and primary prevention...Hypertrophic and keloid scar-related physical discomfort ranging from itching to pain have been seen to improve dramatically upon SGS treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additional benefits include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...no skin stripping, and no painful skin or hair pulling; but another advantage also lies in the fact that...unlike alternatives, have a low viscous component that limits their flow and consequently their readiness to absorb materials at the surface of the skin such as stratum corneum cells and lipids.  The adhesive surface...remains relatively clean and can be removed, reused and cleaned repeatedly without diminishing its integrity.</p>
  
  <p>...used in scar treatment for more than 30 years, demonstrating safety and efficacy recognized by wound care professionals.</p>
  
  <p>...silicone gel sheeting has been demonstrated to reduce incidence of hypertrophic scars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same abstract references several topical silicone-containing scar care products and, when comparing <strong>silicone gel</strong> and <strong>silicone gel sheeting</strong>, the limitations of silicone gel sheeting specifically </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...can be cumbersome to keep on the scar, with some patients showing an aversion to wearing SGS in visible areas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, silicone gel was said to have </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…a higher compliance than gel sheeting, due primarily to ease of use and convenience...[but] A few studies have suggested no significant difference between the gel and gel sheeting. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the abstract also confesses that additional studies are needed with all therapies used to treat scars, your question is still addressed to some degree. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…<strong>silicone gel sheeting can be employed, especially as an <em>adjunct in combination</em> with other hypertrophic scar and keloid treatments.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the provided information, you can <em>technically</em> use both topical scar treatments at the same time but may not receive an added benefit from the combination. Thus, using one or the other should be just as effective. The effectiveness of using one or both products will likely depend on your individual biology because (as with any therapy), individual responses and results may vary. </p>

<p>In conclusion, it is always in your best interest to consult with your primary care physician or dermatologist to discuss the best treatment option(s) for your specific condition and individual needs.</p>

"Truth or myth to get white teeth?","103","","<p>I've read in some forum that coconut oil or hydrogen peroxide could help to remove plaque and stains from teeth and will got white teeth.

When there was saying it'll help to have fresh breath. </p>
","<p>Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda</p>

<p>Here's your best approach:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use less baking soda than hydrogen peroxide, and make sure your paste isn't gritty.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine about two tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide with one tablespoon of baking soda.</p></li>
<li><p>Stir it into a paste and start brushing.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the paste stand about a minute and then rinse.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's always important to thoroughly rinse your mouth afterward so no hydrogen peroxide or baking soda is left over. And above all, limit use of your paste to two or three times a week. Excessive use of baking soda can have the reverse effect of cleaning, breaking down your enamel over time and causing sensitivity in your teeth. So, make sure you maintain your regular oral care regimen.</p>

<p>Coconut Oil Rinse</p>

<p>It won’t make a difference by “bleaching” per say, but lauric acid in coconut oil can rid your teeth of bacteria found in plaque that can make them yellow. It is also supposed to promote gum health, and help keep your breath fresh. </p>

<p>You will need…
-About a tablespoon of coconut oil</p>

<p>Directions
 In the morning, before you brush your teeth, scoop out a tablespoon or a little less (depending on the size of your mouth) of coconut oil. You can either soften it, or just put it in your mouth. Push, swish, and “pull” the oil through and around your teeth for 10-15 minutes, then spit it out, rinse with water, and brush your teeth.</p>

<li>What is in the product that is applied to the hair?</li>
</ol>

Each follicle has its own life cycle that can be influenced by age, disease, and a wide variety of other factors. This life cycle is divided into three phases: 1. Anagen -- active hair growth that lasts between two to six years 2. Catagen -- transitional hair growth that lasts two to three weeks
  3. Telogen -- resting phase that lasts about two to three months; <strong>at the end of the resting phase the hair is shed</strong> and a new hair replaces it and the growing cycle starts again.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially in males going <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bald with age</a> is very common. </p>

<p>If it is this kind of genetic fate <em>or</em> because of underlying medical conditions (toxins, too much supplements…) asking questions on the web is no the best course of action. For that a medical examination is needed and prescriptions for <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/men-hair-loss-17/slideshow-men-hair-loss-treatment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">finasterid or hair transplants</a> are equally unsuitable for 'the cloud'.

<p>That means it is not an unrealistic assumption that indeed the product just causes trouble. It is a conglomerate of questionable ingredients. But that is far from certain! All of these substances are allowed in cosmetics after all. None of them is listed as directly causes premature hair loss. </p>

<p>One explanation to consider is the perceptual issue of an aging man in panic finding these hairs: As stated earlier, hairs are constantly falling out. If some of them were glued together with gel before falling out that might just mean they did not increase in number; but that they only became much more noticeable that way.</p>

The thing is that I've been playing piano for a years, but I unfortunately my hands aren't big (just a regular ones, or probably even a little bit smaller than average male hands), however I would like to take wide chords, I need to do something to increase the length of my fingers a little bit (3-7mm for each finger should give me +1cm for a hand span [probably a little bit more]), and I try to find a way to do that using science.</p>
","<p>As an adult, no, there's no safe way to lengthen your bones.  The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate"" rel=""nofollow"">epiphyseal plates</a> at the ends of your bones have ossified, so hormonal treatments have nothing to operate on.</p>

<p>There is a technique for lengthening bones in adults, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction_osteogenesis"" rel=""nofollow"">distraction osteogenesis</a>, where the bones are intentionally broken and then stretched during the healing process.  I've never heard of it being used on the fingers (as opposed to the leg bones or the jaw), and it's got a <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00180230?LI=true"" rel=""nofollow"">relatively high complication rate</a>.</p>

"Switching hot and and cold water while taking bath","102","","<p>I have a habit of toggling between hot and cold water while taking shower. Does this result faster wrinkle (or faster aging of skin) of skin, because hot water cause expansion and cold water cause contraction of skin (applying the effect of temperature on other material) .</p>

<p>I want to know whether these parameter has any effect on skin or skin health depend solely on vitamin and protein intake.  </p>
","<p>Skin wrinkles are generally caused by <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-collagen#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a breakdown of the collagen framework within the skin</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collagen is a key part of your skin's structure. It forms a network of fibers within your skin that acts like a framework.</p>
  
  <p>In young skin, the collagen framework is intact and the skin remains moisturized and elastic. Over time, the support structure weakens and the skin loses its elasticity. The skin begins to lose its tone as the collagen support wears down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrinkles and other signs of skin ageing <a href=""http://www.webmd.boots.com/healthy-skin/guide/ageing-skin-do-you-look-older-than-you-should"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can be influenced by habits and behaviours during a person's life</a>. Avoiding some risk factors for premature skin ageing can help keep skin looking younger for longer.</p>

<p>As well as smoking causing premature skin aging,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wrinkles at the corners of the eyes (crow's feet) or between the eyebrows (frown lines) are thought to be caused by small muscle contractions. Over a lifetime, habitual facial expressions like frowning, smiling or squinting leave their mark on our skin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first link states that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using your facial muscles -- smiling, frowning, or squinting, for instance -- is part of expressing yourself. That's normal, but it does stress the collagen in your skin. Over time, that stress adds up and contributes to facial lines and wrinkles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To answer your question concerning hot and cold showers or baths, the processes within the body which help with <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/z4khvcw/revision/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">homeostasis</a> could have an effect on the collagen framework.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/z4khvcw/revision/2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Vasoconstriction and vasodilation</strong></a> are the processes which take place to alter the amount of blood flow throught the capilliaries of the skin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blood vessels leading to the skin capillaries become narrower — they constrict — letting less blood flow through the skin and conserving heat in the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question would be <strong>would vasoconstriction and vasodilation have such a big impact on the collagen framework?</strong>  I cannot find any articles which answer this and therefore I would say that this is open to opinion.  On the other hand, another aspect of bathing is that the skin wrinkles in baths, and in the shower if you're in there long enough.</p>

<p>The epidermis, or outer layer of the skin, is <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-fingers-wrinkle-in/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">made up of cells called keratinocytes</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>which form a very strong intracellular skeleton made up of a protein called keratin. These cells divide rapidly at the bottom of epidermis, pushing the higher cells upward. After migrating about halfway from the bottom of this layer to the top, the cells undergo a programmed death. The nucleus involutes, leaving alternating layers of the cell membrane, made of lipids, and the inside, made largely of water-loving keratin. The outer layer of the epidermis, called the stratum corneum, is thus composed of these alternating bands.</p>
  
  <p>When hands are soaked in water, the keratin absorbs it and swells. The inside of the fingers, however, does not swell. As a result, there is relatively too much stratum corneum and it wrinkles, just like a gathered skirt. This bunching up occurs on fingers and toes because the epidermis is much thicker on the hands and feet than elsewhere on the body. (The hair and nails, which contain different types of keratin, also absorb some water. This is why the nails get softer after bathing or doing the dishes.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This skin bunching happens in hot <strong>and</strong> cold water, and it can lead to damage to the collagen framework just like any other skin movement through frowning, smiling etc.</p>

"What are ibuprofen alternatives without the side effects","102","","<p>Came across an <a href=""https://qz.com/944231/ibuprofen-has-some-nasty-side-effects-that-doctors-have-known-about-for-a-while/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> saying that Ibuprofen blocking COX-1 and COX-2 has side effects: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They work by inhibiting enzymes called cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and 2
  (COX-2). These are involved in a number of internal pathways that
  result in production of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins,
  which promote inflammation and increase pain perception.</p>
  
  <p>Animal studies have shown blocking COX-2 and the subsequent pathway of
  prostaglandin production may have the unwanted effects of increasing
  the tendency of blood to clot inside arteries, and a reduced ability
  of the heart to heal after a heart attack. In the early 2000s, a
  number of large studies found a significant association of negative
  heart events, such as heart attack and stroke, with the use of
  selective COX-2 inhibitors. This resulted in two of these drugs,
  Valdecoxib and Rofecoxib or Vioxx, being withdrawn from the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They talk about a lot of products doing the same and taken off the shelves.</p>

<p>However they don't propose any alternatives with same benefits and no side effects. </p>

<p>I'm no expert and no doctor, so I'm coming here to ask about what soft pain killer should I use instead to avoid those side effects and have the same pain killing effect, even if it's less strong? Tylenol ? </p>
","<h1>Are ibuprofen side effects something to worry about?</h1>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: maybe.</p>

<p><strong>Longer answer</strong>: As with a lot of health questions, it depends on how they are being taken. If, for example, you hurt yourself playing a sport and want to take a painkiller for some short-term relief, ibuprofen <em>probably</em> won't do you much harm in the short term.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you are in chronic pain (or inflammation, as another answer notes) the situation is a little different. If you are taking an <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anti-inflammatories-non-steroidal/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">NSAID</a> - ibuprofen is one of several in this class of drug - on a regular basis it's worthwhile watching out for some side effects. One mentioned in the article you linked are <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Peptic-ulcer/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">stomach ulcers</a> as NSAIDs can have an effect on the protective lining of the stomach. Usually some form of '<em>gastroprotection</em>' is offered to offset this, such as a PPI (proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole).</p>

<p>As another example, if you are taking ibuprofen for recurrect headaches (eg migraines), you can counter-intuitively end up getting another kind of headache, called a [medication overuse headache(<a href=""https://www.migrainetrust.org/about-migraine/types-of-migraine/other-headache-disorders/medication-overuse-headache/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.migrainetrust.org/about-migraine/types-of-migraine/other-headache-disorders/medication-overuse-headache/</a>) (MOH). </p>

<p>The bottom line is that any long-term use should be discussed with a medical professional; who can assess relative risks and check for interactions with any other regular medications.</p>

<h2>But ibuprofen/NSAIDs can't be safe! Vioxx was taken off the market...</h2>

<p>Quite true. From <a href=""https://qz.com/944231/ibuprofen-has-some-nasty-side-effects-that-doctors-have-known-about-for-a-while/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the article you quoted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the early 2000s, a number of large studies found a significant association of negative heart events, such as heart attack and stroke, with the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors. This resulted in two of these drugs, Valdecoxib and Rofecoxib or Vioxx, being withdrawn from the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Vioxx controversy was a pretty big deal, and resulted in compensatory payouts and fines. The <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200011233432103#t=article"" rel=""noreferrer"">VIGOR study</a> demonstrated a 4-fold increase in heart attack risk on rofecoxib (Vioxx) versus naproxen. This was attributed to the 'cardioprotective' effect of naproxen. This was incorrect, and another trial (<a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa050493"" rel=""noreferrer"">APPROVe</a> was stopped early because selective COX-2 inhibitors demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events. There was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib#Litigation"" rel=""noreferrer"">raft of litigation</a> relating to the sale of Vioxx, with payouts and fines in the billions of dollars.</p>

<p>If you are interested, the Vioxx controversy created lots of discussion ongoing to this day- from editorials, to book sections, entire books themselves and arguments relating to tort reform. It is clearly beyond the scope of this question! </p>

<p>That said, not all NSAIDs are Vioxx; and as noted above, it is possible to take them (even ibuprofen) relatively safely.</p>

<h2>What are the alternatives to ibuprofen?</h2>

<p>As another answer comments, it depends on what you are taking ibuprofen for. As mentioned above, you may be fine continuing to take ibuprofen, depending on circumstances.</p>

<p>Alternatives include:</p>

<ul>
<li>naproxen (another NSAID, but with <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019238/"" rel=""noreferrer"">lesser risk / may be protective</a>)</li>
<li>paracetamol / acetaminophen (ie Tylenol, as you say)</li>
<li>NSAID cream / gel, eg for joint pain</li>
<li>tramadol may help for some kinds of pain, but there are issues with addiction and constipation</li>
<li>alternatives, such as exercise, acupuncture, meditation etc can all potentially reduce pain</li>

"Effects of commuting on health","101","","<p>I've been trying to figure out whether or not my commute may be affecting my health in a major way. Does commuting have an effect on health in any way? If so, does it matter how long the commute is, what kind of transportation (bus, train, or car), or the time of day when commuting?</p>

<p>I tried googling this but while I found several news articles, I haven't found links to studies and solid research.</p>
","<p>When studied from a physiological point of view, commuting is generally divided into two categories: active and non-active. The former involves modes of transportation such as walking and bicycling, where the commuter is actively getting exercise. The latter involves modes of transportation such as cars, buses, and trains, where the commuter is getting virtually no exercise.</p>

<p>Many studies compare modes of transportation that fall into different categories; I chose to put them into one or the other based on which mode was focused on more. Other studies focused solely on one type of commuting. If you want to skip the specifics, you can go all the way to the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Cardiovascular health from exercise and exposure to air pollution are the two main effects of commuting, although commuting may have minor effects on stress and mental health. Cyclists and walkers had much better cardiovascular health than non-active commuters in cars, buses, trains, and subways. This may lead to lower risks of obesity and diabetes.</p>

<p>Exposure to air pollution varied. Commuters using the subways were exposed to different levels of different air particles than aboveground commuters. Commuters in some buses were exposed to high levels of air pollution; however, walkers and cyclists were exposed to high(er) levels in some cases. This exposure can lead to respiratory problems, although this has not yet been studied in great detail.</p>

"Effects of eating too much salt","101","","<p>I have been reading up on the effects of eating too much salt as I have literally been addicted to salt. I found out few side effects and it all matches up with my body. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>High blood pressure </li>
<li>Facial bloating </li>
<li>Frequent urge to urinate.</li>
<li>Calcium deficiency </li>
<li>Hypertension </li>
</ol>

<p>However, I found conflicting theories about urination. My question is if too much sodium makes your kidneys retains water, then what explains frequent urination?</p>

<p>If my body is retaining water shouldn't I feel more thirsty and pee less? I, however rarely feel thirsty and urinate more than a usual amount.</p>
","<p>In short: Increased sodium intake may or may not result in water retention, but it does result in increased urination.</p>

<p>Let's say you are consuming 5 grams of salt per day during a certain period. Then, one day you increase salt intake to 10 grams per day. This <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19173770"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">may or may not result in <strong>water retention,</strong></a> which will develop fully within few days and become stable at a certain level, so on the end you will have, for example, 2 liters more water in your body than before.</p>

<p>Another thing is, that your body wants to maintain blood sodium at a certain level, so your kidneys will excrete the extra sodium. Since the kidneys can excrete sodium only together with a certain amount of water, you will also <strong><a href=""http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/38/3/317"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">excrete more water (urine)</a>.</strong> Also, with increased salt intake you probably drink more water, which you will again need to excrete (urinate more).</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> After an increase of salt intake, water retention will occur as a single event developing to its highest level within few days and than stabilize. On the other hand, your kidneys will continuously excrete the extra sodium (accompanied by water), so you will urinate more during the entire period of your increased salt intake. This is how you can have water retention and increased urination at the same time.</p>

<p>About <strong>thirst.</strong> With increased salt intake, you usually become more thirsty, but some people have <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989478/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">weak sense of thirst</a>, so you might not be able to make reliable conclusions from thirst alone.</p>

","<p>Persons with 20/40 (0.5) visual acuity need 2x magnification.  This does not mean, however, that they have lost 50% of their visual abilities.  Clinicians have long used the expression “lines gained” or lines lost” to indicate changes in visual ability.  The Visual Acuity Score (VAS) provides a convenient scale to estimate visual abilities.  On this scale 20/20 is rated as 100; on charts with a logarithmic progression each line is worth 5 points and each letter read is 1 point.  50 VAS points stand for 20/200; it is reasonable to estimate that at this level the average person has lost 50% of visual ability. Zero is reached for 20/2000, a level at which it is difficult to speak about visual acuity, since 100x magnification is needed for detail recognition.</p>

<p>In the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (5th and 6th edition) the VAS scale is used in the calculation of visual disability.  A study has shown that the AMA calculations provide better ability estimates than scales that were used previously.</p>

"What is the test for Endometriosis","100","","<p>My girlfriend (44, never had kids) has very severe pain and cramps during her period. Her gynaecologist just gives her pain killers.
What tests should she do to figure out if she has Endometriosis?</p>
","<p>The most common ways to diagnose endometriosis are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Palpation/physical exam</li>
<li>Imaging test (MRI, Ultrasound)</li>
<li>Laparoscopy*</li>
</ul>

<p>Laparoscopy, where the doctor makes a small incision to insert a camera tube into the pelvic area for a visual examination, is the only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis. In each case, the doctor is looking for cysts or scars outside the uterus, due to tissue (endometrium) growing where it shouldn't.</p>

<p>If you suspect that she has this, I would suggest talking to her doctor and asking specifically about exams to rule it out, especially given her age and pain during menstruation. (I would also suggest it if the pain is new. If she has had painful menstruation all her life, it's less likely but still can't be ruled out.)</p>

<p>I wash the tomatoes before consuming, aiming to remove any pesticides (or other surface contaminents).</p>

"Can oral contraceptives prevent ovarian cysts from forming?","98","","<p>I wanted to know if there are any ways or any preventive measure that a female can take to prevent the formation of ovarian cyst. In many websites I found that using oral contraceptives prevents the formation of ovarian cyst. </p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>[I]s it logical/healthy to take in oral contraceptives on a regular basis even if one is not engaged in intercourse?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several reasons to take oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that have nothing to do with contraception. In that way, they can be considered medications to treat medical conditions, not contraceptives.</p>

<p>In the case of women who bleed heavily during their periods, or those have their periods too frequently or irregularly, OCP's can reduce the amount of bleeding preventing anemia and can ""regulate"" cycles. </p>

<p>When a woman has <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/975/"">excessive pain with menstruation</a>, OCPs can decrease the pain significantly. If women suffer from debilitating premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms (aka PMS), OCP help considerably.</p>

<p>OCPs have been used to treat acne, hirsutism (excessive body hair, especially facial), and significant menstrual-related migraines.</p>

<p>In women with premature menopause, OCP's can decrease the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>Interestingly, OCPs are not considered a good treatment of functional ovarian cysts, though intuitively one would think they were. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most patients are unaware of these health benefits and therapeutic uses of oral contraceptives, and they tend to overestimate their risk. Counseling and education are necessary to help women make well-informed health-care decisions ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with any medication, discussion about the risks of OCP use should take place with the prescribing physician, and in the case of the benefits outweighing the risks, the choice to treat the condition with OCPs is quite logical. </p>

"How does gallbladder removal affects fat digestion?","98","","<p>If I understand correctly, the sole purpose of the gallbladder is to store extra bile that is opportunely released in order to properly digest fat.</p>

<p>When the gallbladder is removed, <strong>what happens when there's not enough bile to digest a given amount of fat?</strong> And particularly, <strong>what happens with the fat that does not get digested?</strong></p>

<p>I had my gallbladder removed a few weeks back and I've heard that consuming a relatively high amount of fat might produce problems such as diarrhea, gas and bloating, but I haven't experienced these (fortunately, or perhaps I haven't consumed a meal high enough in fat yet). In addition, I don't understand if the undigested fat is excreted or just stored in the body—as opposed to being properly used as a nutrient (I Googled this and there are mentions and accounts of both weight loss and gain; I didn't find proper research papers or a reliable source).</p>
","<p>The bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. After a meal, fats trigger gallbladder contraction, which results in the release of the bile into the small intestine. The bile helps to digest fats.</p>

<p>The liver is connected to the small intestine by the common bile duct. When your gallbladder is removed, the bile will flow from the liver via the bile duct directly into the small intestine. This continuous flow of the bile can irritate the intestine and trigger diarrhea.</p>

<p>After gallbladder removal, the bile is still delivered into the intestine, so all the fat should be properly digested as before.</p>

<p>Sometimes, during gallbladder removal, a small stone accidentally passes into the common bile duct and blocks the flow of the bile through it. This prevents fat digestion. The undigested fat moves further into the colon, where it is partially broken down by normal intestinal bacteria (which results in gas) and partially excreted in the stool (which results in smelly, floating and pale stools) (<a href=""http://slu.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=617&amp;pid=1&amp;gid=000263"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adam</a>).</p>

So chances are, if you're not careful, you will overshoot your daily requirement of protein by eating other food (which also has some protein). Too much protein not only can overload your kidneys (which are desperately trying to get rid of the excess) but will also be stored in your body as fat. This is especially true because protein powders are very concentrated, and you don't need much of it when you're not working out.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, it's not a bad idea if you meticulously keep track of exactly what and how much you eat per day to meet your nutrient requirements and not overshoot them. You also need to have knowledge of your body type, rate of metabolism and other factors. Its just much more inconvenient to do this when you're not working out, so I wouldn't recommend it personally. </p>

<p>If you were thinking a protein shake can replace a meal, then absolutely not. You could make some super-shakes containing a large fraction of the nutrients you need with some crafty planning, but you won't escape eating something along with it anyway. Do yourself a favor a find some time for a nice lunch. If you're really low on time, prep the food at home and carry it with you, but when it comes to food - be nice to yourself.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

","<p>Answer for the US and Canada:</p>

<p>Call 911 and explain the situation. They will be able to either forward your call or give you a number to call faster than you can find it on your own. Dispatch centers contact each other all the time so they know in advance how to do so.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work for some reason, grab google and type in ""[Somewhere] Idaho Police Department"" and call them directly. Next attempt: Idaho State Police.</p>

","<p>Ear tubes do many things to help ear infections. The most important things they do are draining the ear of fluid and ventilating the ear. Overall, this will help your child hear better. The tubes also stop fluid from building up behind the ear drum, which should help prevent the ear infections.</p>

<h3>Stuff to watch out for</h3>

<p>There is always the possibility of ear infections coming back after the 6-12 months that the tubes will be in. There is also a minor chance of hearing loss because of scarring of the ear drum. The tube can become blocked, stopping it from working. To help prevent these complications, you will have to routinely visit the doctor for a systems check.</p>

","<p><strong>Firstly is it definitely eczema and is it only eczema?</strong></p>

<p>The discharge of pus suggests a bacterial infection (probably staphylococcal). Now this could be superimposed on eczema (which causes the skin barrier to break down causing an infection) or simply just a skin infection/abscess. Either way, if it really is an infection this usually requires antibiotics. Thus you should see a doctor.</p>

<p><strong>If it is eczema, once the infection is treated:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Self care techniques - is there a trigger? Avoid it and avoid as much as possible the compulsion to itch</li>
<li>Steroid creams - these reduce the inflammation and are very helpful</li>
<li>Moisturising creams - these maintain the skin barrier. Use them for a long period of time even when the skin looks completely healthy</li>

"Severe asthma and autoimmune skin reactions with no relief","95","","<p>I have lived almost my entire life in Ross County, Ohio, <a href=""http://scorecard.goodguide.com/env-releases/hap/county.tcl?fips_county_code=39141#rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">which is quite polluted</a>. I remember smelling the <a href=""http://scorecard.goodguide.com/env-releases/facility.tcl?tri_id=45601MDCRP401SP#maps"" rel=""nofollow"">paper mill</a> when I was young, I don't even smell it anymore, but people comment about it when they are in Chillicothe. Much of my childhood involved using wood stoves or kerosene heating in the winter. I remember the year 2000 when my father had plastic wrap up instead of a wall and used kerosene for heating. When I was young, I was never able to run like everyone else, and my breathing bothered me from time to time. By the time I was in high school I no longer participated in any sports. But it wasn't until a few years ago, when I joined the Army, that I was diagnosed with asthma. It meant I could never meet the physical requirements and I was sent home from basic half way through, since the inhaler didn't help enough. But since then, it seems to be getting even worse. Two years ago we partially heated the house with a clothes drier, since it was very cold and the heater wasn't working at low temperatures, and I ended up in the emergency room a few times for my breathing difficulties, I could hardly stand at times. The doctor believed the clothes drier caused it because of the extra particulate matter. </p>

<p>Last year I moved to Warsaw, Poland, to attend a university (it is far, far cheaper and the cost of living is extremely low, so I was able to afford it), but my breathing got so bad I had to return to the US. While in Poland, a skin issue started to appear. It appeared on my legs, arms, and especially on my hands. I just realized it is only the areas that are generally exposed (below the knees, near the elbow and lower). I saw numerous dermatologists, which proscribed me multiple fungal creams, antibiotics, and finally steroids. It seems to get better and worse, but it has never gone away. At its absolute worse, it would randomly bleed, appear red, and itch. The skin remains dry. I now have a powerful steroid (“Halcinonide Cream, USP 0.1%”). I have been using it for 5 or 6 months, off and on (when it gets better and worse), but it never goes completely away. Recently it has covered almost the entire top part of my arms, from a bit above the elbow, to my knuckles, and the front of my legs, from the knees to my ankles. I also have a lot of dandruff now, which I never had before. </p>

<p>I returned to Warsaw for the summer, arriving in early may, and I am about to fly back to the US. With the lower cost of living, and the very low cost of medical care, it actually saved me to come here for the summer. I also met the woman I love here, and we got married this summer, which is the primary reason I came back! I plan to come back in December and have two teeth removed (with airline tickets, it is still cheaper than in the US). In the US, I live with my mother, close to a busy road. In Poland, the road isn't too busy, but pollution is high, and there is a bus terminal along the building, and a lot of buses come and go (which I'm sure releases a lot of DPM).</p>

<p>My wife was recently told that our pet guinea pig likely exacerbates my asthma and caused my skin problem. We got him when it started getting cold (my breathing always gets worse at that time) and this is when my skin problems and breathing began to get worse. I ended up on strong steroid inhalers but it didn't help much. I constantly felt like I was drowning. In the spring, I stopped using the steroid inhaler because it wasn't helping all that much and I was back to my almost normal state. But I hate this normal state. I honestly can't remember the last time I didn't feel like something is stuck in my throat, like peanutbutter that won't go down. Sometimes I can't sleep and I feel tired for days. In the winters, I can hardly walk to my car without feeling like I'm suffocating. I didn't have heat in my car for awhile, which made things even more difficult. </p>

<p>I can't afford to move out of my mom's house. I don't know what else I can do about my breathing and my skin. I thought about buying a HEPA air filter, but they are very expensive, and I don't know how much that can help. I really don't know what more I can do, the doctors I have seen haven't helped much, and it is expensive and takes a lot of time I don't have. What options do I have? What should I try to do to help with my asthma and skin? (I almost never use the ""rescue inhaler"" unless I really <em>really</em> need to, but recently I need it more) Would the HEPA filter help me with this? </p>

<p>I just wish I could sleep and breathe</p>
","<p>There are numerous causes and sources of irritation for Asthma exacerbations.  Your objective is finding out whether it's irritants (smoke, chemicals, lint, etc) or allergies (pollen, pet dander) that is setting you off.  Once you identify the source, you can then take steps to prevent it.  It also appears that you've been exposed to poor air quality for a majority of your life, and you're STILL being exposed to it.  I don't imagine this will be easy, but you need to find a residence that IMPROVES your ability to breathe.  </p>

<p>In terms of medications, Asthma is generally managed with both alpha agonists (ex: Albuterol) and corticosteroids (ex: Prednisone).  You need to work closely with your primary care provider (MD, NP, PA, etc) or with a specialist (Pulmonology/Allergist/Immunology) to determine what medication regimen will provide the best results while also limiting the amount of medications you NEED to take.  This is also true for your skin condition.</p>

<p>In short, you need to identify what causes your flares for both your Asthma and skin condition.  No one will work more diligently than yourself, and in my experience, it is the patients that are involved in their care that are often the best managed. So, keep a log when your flare ups occur.  Include the following:</p>

<p>DATE
TIME
What were you doing when it occurred? (At rest or duing activity?  Cooking? Eating? Sleeping? Etc)
Where did it occur? (Urban/Rural, Indoors/Outdoors, Specific area?)
How long did it last?  (If the duration last days, go back and record it)
Did anything make it better or worse?  (Resting? Medication? Sleeping? Etc)</p>

"What are plasma donations used for?","95","","<p>While a lot of blood donor websites online tell you what plasma is composed of, they don't seem to go into what it's used for. </p>

<p>What are some potential applications of plasma donations, and is there anything you do with them that you can't/wouldn't do with whole blood donations? </p>
","<p>As you might very well know blood contains following substances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plasma proteins (albumin, globulin, fibrinogen etc.)</li>
<li>Clotting factors</li>
<li>Glucose</li>
<li>Electrolytes</li>
</ul>

<p>All these are essential for body homeostasis. Human body can suffer from the lack of any of these substances.</p>

<p>Lack of plasma proteins results to swelling of the feet (fluid escapes blood vessels) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"" rel=""nofollow"">ascites</a> (intra-abdominal fluid) due to low <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncotic_pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">colloid osmotic pressure</a>. They are many albumin products available which can be used to substitute the lack of albumin in blood.</p>

<p>They are not that many indications to give frozen plasma to patients (<a href=""http://reference.medscape.com/drug/ffp-octaplas-fresh-frozen-plasma-999499"" rel=""nofollow"">Medscape</a>, <a href=""http://www.bcshguidelines.com/documents/FFP_28020604.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">British Committee for standards in haematology</a>). The main indication to frozen plasma is the treat the lack of clotting factors. <strong>Clotting factors cannot be synthesized compared other substances in the plasma and therefore frozen plasma is manufactured and given to patients.</strong></p>

<p>Common reason for lack of clotting factors is major bleeding (trauma etc.) Therefore frozen plasma is routinely given to patients with major trauma and subsequent bleeding. Patients with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia"" rel=""nofollow"">haemophilia</a> or coagulation factor deficiency and treated with frozen plasma. Third common indication for frozen plasma transfusion is any kind of liver disease. Liver is responsible for manufacturing coagulation factors and therefore patients suffering fro <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"" rel=""nofollow"">severe liver disease</a> do not have normal levels of clotting factors in their blood.</p>

<p>Of course there many other indications for frozen plasma transfusion but I think those cover the most important one and give some insight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Green tea is good for cavity protection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Cavity prevention</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Because green tea controls bacteria and lowers the acidity of saliva and dental plaque, it may be a useful tool in preventing cavities. A recent Egypt-based study tested people before and after they gave their mouths a five-minute rinse with green tea. The test subjects had less bacteria and acid in their mouths, as well as reduced gum bleeding. Other research has found that drinking green tea shows promise when it comes to preventing tooth decay.</p>

The question has three parts really, they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is green tea really good against cavity?</li>
<li>How much? Is it even worth mentioning?</li>
<li>Do you have some reliable source? (big medical research, world respected dentist, or something like these)</li>

","<p>Green tea, or any real tea made from the Camellia sinensis plant, has many advantages as a go-to beverage.</p>

<p>It itself does <em>not</em> contain significant amounts of sugar, it has an enamel preserving pH level (that is: it is non-acidic). Some compounds (like the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19397954"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">poyphenols</a>) have shown some activity against harmful bacteria causing gingivitis or caries.</p>

<p>The most significant part plays the sometimes enormous amount of fluoride tea contains. Fluoride hardens the enamel against acids from bacteria metabolising around. In fact tea has often <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5497633/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">so much fluoride that this is much more likely to be a health concern</a> than the caffeine content some hysterics worry about. (<a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/do-fluoride-levels-in-cheap-tea-pose-a-health-risk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Or not?</a> Since everyone should only buy tea that was tested for pesticides,  radioactivity, and other contaminations, why not demand a chemical analysis sheet as well?)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Green tea is tooth friendly. It does not cause or aggravate tooth decay. On the contrary, it usually makes your teeth stronger (and stains them, alas) – Green tea will not stop or reverse caries.</p></li>
<li><p>Every sugar drink replaced by tea helps. How much tea is needed for the effects of fluoride to be significant depends on other dietary factors, water fluoridation and tooth paste used. The amount of tea is therefore impossible to gauge exactly but an upper limit is dependent on how much tea a user can take (if the fluoride content is kept well below a dosage causing problems like fluorosis) since caffeine and tannins are not equally well tolerated by everyone.</p></li>

  Assam tea has stronger biofilm inhibition activity against S. mutans than green tea. A substance of &lt;10kDa in mass in Assam tea had a high concentration of galloylated catechins and a stronger biofilm inhibiting activity than green tea. In contrast, substances >10kDa in mass from green tea included higher concentrations of polysaccharides composed of galacturonic acid, such as pectin, that enhance biofilm formation.<br>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong>
  The higher concentrations of galloylated catechins in Assam tea may assist in prevention of dental caries, whereas in green tea, this mode of inhibition was likely offset by the presence of pectin. Purification of catechins in partially fermented Assam tea with lower-molecular-weight polysaccharide than pectin may be useful for developing oral care products such as toothpaste and oral care gel pastes.</p>

"Is it unhealthy to steam my eyes in order to cure Blepharitis?","94","","<p>In order to treat my Blepharitis, I put a towel over my head and allow steam from a bowl of water to clear the sebaceous glands between my eye lashes, which glands deliver oil to the surface of the eye. </p>

<p>The surface of the eye needs not only moisture, but a small amount of oil in order to form a film across the eyeball. If the oil is not properly delivered, the water in the eye forms a droplet and dribbles out, causing, paradoxically, not only a leaking eye but a dry eye.</p>

<p>My question is, am I damaging my eye by steaming it ?</p>

","<p>No one can answer your question whether you are ""damaging your eye by steaming it"" because it depends on your methods whether it's harming the eyeball.</p>

<p>Your eye does need moisture, which is the purpose of the oil glands.  If your <a href=""https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/blepharitis-treatment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blepharitis</a> involves clogged oil glands, then they're not putting out the oil that they should.

"Which type of chair is best to avoid back pain?","94","","<p>I'm aware that such chairs are called ergonomic chairs. But what things does one have to consider while buying these chairs? Height, arm rest, back rest, etc?</p>

<p>I'll be thankful if you could post some images for the explanation. Also what should be the height of table to keep your laptop and operate it? </p>

<p>Images would be very helpful.</p>
","<p>I can share my personal experience with you. I'm a 31 year old guy with a sedentary job where I need to spend hours on my computer. I developed lower back pain around 6-7 years ago and more recently upper back and neck pain. I went for Physiotherapy and felt relieved from the pain. So my answer will be based on recommendations of my physiotherapist.</p>

<p>Before telling about the chair I would share about the ideal posture with the help of the following <a href=""http://www.dual-monitors-guide.com/guide-to-comfortable-and-ergonomic-computer-station.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">figure</a><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1y3ko.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1y3ko.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This figure appeared in a google search and is closest to the physiotherapist's recommendation.</p>

<p>Based on this posture the points to note when choosing a chair is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Height should be adjustable such that your eye level is as indicated in the figure. In addition your feet must be flat with thighs supported on the chair and parallel to the floor. With a laptop, maintaining eye level can be a problem. IMO, you can use a wireless mouse and keyboard and keep the laptop at a suitable height.</li>
<li>Arm rest may not always be good. It should not be so high that it blocks you from moving closer to your desk. Ideally you should be close enough to the desk so that your elbows rest on the desk. Height of the desk should be such that shoulders are relaxed and don't feel pushed up by the desk. Sometimes if you rest your arm on the arm rest and use a mouse placed on the desk, the edge of the desk can put unnecessary pressure on the wrists.</li>
<li>Back rest should be flat with slight curve for supporting lumbar back. If needed you can use a lumbar back support or a cushion for the purpose. The ideal angle for the backrest (from horizontal) should be around 100 degrees so that you are almost upright. </li>
<li>In addition the seat should not be too hard as it can put unnecessary pressure on the hips.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, I was recommended not to slouch or lean forward. For this the screen should be at a right distance and font size should be large enough for you to read while sitting straight (leaning back on the chair). Moreover take regular breaks from work and walk around a bit.</p>

<p>Note that this is what my physiotherapist told and I felt benefited. I haven't read any studies on this, so scientific references are welcome.</p>

Can they be maintained if skills are utilized often?","93","","<p>Babies have extraordinary instincts upon their arrival just into this world. It just happens naturally. One of these is of the swimming variety as witnessed in this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mr47DJIuTc"" rel=""noreferrer"">Underwater Baby Divers</a>. Who knew!?! </p>

<p>The trait we just witnessed in this video is  described in this article,
<a href=""http://www.livescience.com/20802-newborn-baby-skills.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Life Science: 5 Incredible Baby Skills</a>, known as: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the <strong>""diving reflex,""</strong> also known as the <strong>bradycardic response</strong>; also
  exhibited by seals and other aquatic animals, the instinct may be a
  vestige of our ancient marine origins.</p>
  
  <p>It works like this: Infants up to 6 months old whose heads are
  submerged in water will naturally hold their breath. At the same time,
  their heart rates slow, helping them to conserve oxygen, and blood
  circulates primarily between their most vital organs, the heart and
  brain. The survival response keeps accidentally submerged babies alive
  much longer than adults would survive underwater.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another astounding video to watch is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU-LRUc8TSE"" rel=""noreferrer"">Babies Swimming</a>, but it is almost 4 minutes long and has uber cheesy music in the background. </p>

<p>A scientific/medically based article is found here: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12022304"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bradycardic response during submersion in infant swimming</a></p>

<p>Now these infants aren't engaging in synchronized swimming extravaganzas or anything of that nature, but what they are capable of doing just on instincts is incredible!!!  I imagine this is a vestige of a positive evolutionary trait. For example, if an infant slipped into a lake while mother was bathing nearby, etc. etc. etc. </p>

<p>NOW TO MY QUESTIONS: </p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Why do infants lose these instincts around 7ish months?</strong> </p>

<p>--- Is it because they are not <strong>as</strong> vulnerable?</p>

<p>--- Or that they are larger and have more strength and their reflexes don't work the same? </p>

<p>--- Or they simply forget because their minds are being filled with other important pieces of information?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> If under the watchful eye of a professional trainer, lifeguard, parent, etc., the infant <strong>utilized these skills frequently, would they be able to maintain their ""diving reflex"" beyond the 7ish month period?</strong> </p>

<p><sub> To be clear I do not advocate at anytime that these infants have advanced swimming capabilities to swim alone... so <strong>never leave a baby or child unattended near a body of water</strong> </sub></p>
","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>First of all, the study should not be trusted too much. Thirty six test subjects does not seem very much to me in order to make such a claim. However, &amp;AtlLED's opinion in the comment differs from this.</p>

<p>From the abstract (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Thirty-six</strong> infants were studied during diving exercises in infant swimming. [...] Although the bradycardic response gradually decreases, the study shows that a clear-cut response exists in children older than has previously been reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I think it is clear that the heart-rate does seem to slow down. There is nothing to very little studies available so the rest of my answer is somewhat <strong>educated speculation</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Frontal Lobe</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The frontal lobe is also the most common place for brain injury to occur. Damage to the frontal lobe can create changes in personality, limited facial expressions, and difficulty in interpreting one’s environment, such as not <strong>being able to adequately assess risk and danger</strong>. (<a href=""http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/frontal-lobe/male"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">healthline.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, an infants frontal lobe is not well developed at the age of 3 months or less. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The volume of the hippocampal formations increased sharply until the age of 2 years, and continued to increase slowly thereafter. (<a href=""http://www.ajnr.org/content/20/4/717.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Study</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a look at this <a href=""http://www.ajnr.org/content/20/4/717/F3.large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neat graph</a> and notice the huge jump from 0 years to 2 years. The steepest growth is presumably around 0,5 years (just guessing from approximation the tangent).<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OvKcN.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OvKcN.gif"" alt=""&lt;code&gt;[Source][3]&lt;/code&gt;""></a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It seems therefore fairly reasonable to me to conclude that around the age of 6 months, the frontal lobe is well developed so that the infant is able to correctly address the risk of drowning. And as any normal human, they would start to <strong>panic</strong> when they <em>realise that they are drowning</em>.<br>
This panicking will cause an increase of heart rate and is the opposite of a bradycardia response.   </p>

<h2>A bit on evolution</h2>

<p>Evolutionary speaking, it makes sense to have a survive-by-all-means mechanism that will be triggered as soon as one is in serious danger. Such a mechanism can be counterproductive in a very few examples, like here when the bradycardia response is reversed. Nevertheless, it is very useful in most cases and therefore, we have this mode. </p>

<p>I would therefore conclude (again, educated guessing) that the bradycardia response of babies was never ""intended"" (1) and is just a side product of them not being able to judge a situation correctly.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>A ""standard"" newborn male infant weighs around 3kg, is about 48cm tall and its head circumference is roughly 34cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Assuming the body is cylindric, this would give us a density of 5.8g/cm^3 (V = π r^2 h, density = V / mass) (<a href=""https://intergrowth21.tghn.org/site_media/media/articles/newbornsize.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Values taken from the Intergrowth.21 study</a>).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qkk93.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qkk93.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I weigh roughly 70kg, am about 180cm tall and my head radius is maybe 30cm, which means my density is about 103.8g/cm^3.<br>
 Concluding, an infants buoyancy is significantly larger than mine. As the infant grows and gains weight, the buoyancy will decrease until the density reaches the density of a full grown human during adolescents. </p>

<p>This does not explain why the heart rate is so low, but it is another factor as to why infants are quite good at swimming.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>(1): Intended is a pretty bad word here. I mean, the argument was about evolution and not creation. I meant by this that the bradycardia response is just a side-product of multiple factors: The survive-by-all-means mechanism in adults and the baby's inability to correctly asses danger.</p>

"Do light boxes effectively mimic the effects of natural sunlight to produce vitamin D?","93","","<p>Since moving to Seattle a few years ago, I'm wondering if I get vitamin D deficiency during the dark rainy months of the year. There are available <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/art-20048298"">light boxes</a> that are used for treated seasonal affective disorder. I’m wondering if these are also effective to prevent vitamin D deficiency when there is inadequate natural UV exposure.</p>

<p>Are artificial lamps able to substitute for natural sunlight to produce vitamin D in the skin? Or can this be replaced effectively by oral supplementation?</p>
","<p>Only two things affect the synthesis of vitamin D, and those are the amount of UVB photons penetrating the skin and the person's age. See my <a href=""http://What%20determines%20the%20amount%20of%20vitamin%20D%20synthesized%20by%20the%20body?%20Solely%20the%20amount%20of%20UVB%20photons%20penetrating%20the%20skin%20and%20the%20person&#39;s%20age:"" rel=""nofollow"">previous answer</a> for an explanation and citations.</p>

<p>So if we disregard age the only question becomes do light boxes supply adequate UVB to synthesize adequate vitamin D? From what I can tell from a review of the products out there, the answer is probably not. Lights adequate to treat SAD aren't adequate to generate vitamin D, and a light that supplied adequate UVB would be dangerous if misused. </p>

<p>But in my mind the final nail in the coffin for light therapy is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10888476"" rel=""nofollow"">this study</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All subjects receiving vitamin D improved in all outcome measures. The
  phototherapy group showed no significant change in depression scale
  measures. Vitamin D status improved in both groups (74% vitamin D
  group, p &lt; 0.005 and 36% phototherapy group, p &lt; 0.01).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, although phototherapy improved vitamin D levels, it did so only half as well as supplements, and unlike supplements it had no effect on depression.</p>

"Effect of antibiotics on breastfed infant","93","","<p>My 9-month old son has been diagnosed with mild bronchiolitis and prescribed 5 days of Azithromycin (not so much to cure a virus-induced bronchiolitis, but in order to prevent possible pneumonia).</p>

<p>Taking aside an obvious concern on prescribing antibiotics for a mild disease (and i have already heard wildly conflicting opinions on this from fellow pediatricians, to the point of me being completely confused), my question is this:</p>

<p><strong>How does breastfeeding impact the negative influence of antibiotics on the infant body, e.g. gut flora? Are there any studies made?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>It would appear that breast feeding allows the infant gut flora to rapidly normalize after the course of antibiotics whereas this can be a problem for artificially fed infants who can suffer with post antibiotic diarrhoea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Savino et al., (2011) studied the gut bacteria of exclusively-breastfed infants, with an average age of 4 months, who were admitted to hospital with pneumonia and treated with the antibiotic, ceftriaxone. As expected, they found a negative effect of antibiotic exposure on faecal bacterial numbers with 5 days of antibiotics significantly reducing faecal bacteria to the point where Lactobacilli were undetectable.</p>
  
  <p>In these exclusively-breastfed infants, faecal bacterial counts returned to pre-antibiotic levels by 15 days after the end of antibiotic treatment. This reflected a rapid reestablishment of commensal bacteria in the infant’s gut. Importantly, there was also no change in stool frequency and no antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in these infants which is a common problem when artificially-fed infants are exposed to antibiotics</p>
  
  <p>Despite being given doses of an antibiotic which has a detrimental effect on gut bacteria, these exclusively-breastfed infants did not suffer from antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and this finding was attributed to exclusive breastfeeding (Savino et al., 2011).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unrelated to the question, breastfed infants also appear to need fewer courses of antibiotics.</p>

"Healthy way to become numb","93","","<p>What can I do to enter a numb state of being so that I don't feel constantly dragged down, fatigue, stress, and all the other downs people experience? For years I've tried exercising, eating healthy, etc. It works to some degree. I get plenty of sleep. I believe the issue is mental. For example, this morning I have a truck load of science experiments to build, but as I sat down to start building them I was swamped with horrible feelings, making it feel like I was carrying a mountain on my shoulders. At least one issue is that I get stressed due to fear of failure. I would much rather spend my entire day thinking. To leave my inner world of thought and actually do physical stuff feels like climbing a tall mountain. It's painful. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to numb such sensations? Sometimes I want to be a robot who feels no pain. Perhaps coffee is the answer. Or meditation. Or electric shock therapy lol. Or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Or joggers high. Or some kind of psychological therapy or hypnosis.</p>

<p>The reason I ask about becoming numb is that twice when life became incredibly horrible I suddenly had the most wonderful blissful sensation of numbness sweep over me. There are no words to describe how wonderful this numbness felt. It didn't last long, about 10 minutes, but during those 10 minutes I could do anything without pain /stress / sadness / fatigue / fear / feeling down. It would be great and more productive to be able to feel like that during my work hours. Thank you so very much for any help!</p>

"How to overcome addiction to sweet sugar foods?","93","","<p>I have developed addiction to sugar sweet flavoured food intakes. I am worrying as I believe it can lead to severe consequences.</p>

<p>How should I overcome this addiction ?</p>
","<p>Here are some ways to tame those sugar cravings.</p>

<p><strong>Give in a little.</strong> Eat a bit of what you’re craving, maybe a small cookie or a fun-size candy bar, suggests Kerry Neville, MS, RD, a registered dietitian and ADA spokeswoman. Enjoying a little of what you love can help you steer clear of feeling denied. Try to stick to a 150-calorie threshold, Neville says.</p>

<p><strong>Combine foods.</strong> If the idea of stopping at a cookie or a baby candy bar seems impossible, you can still fill yourself up and satisfy a sugar craving, too. ""I like combining the craving food with a healthful one,"" Neville says. ""I love chocolate, for example, so sometimes I’ll dip a banana in chocolate sauce and that gives me what I’m craving, or I mix some almonds with chocolate chips."" As a beneficial bonus, you'll satisfy a craving and get healthy nutrients from those good-for-you foods.</p>

<p><strong>Go cold turkey.</strong> Cutting out all simple sugars works for some people, although ""the initial 48 to 72 hours are tough,"" Gerbstadt says. Some people find that going cold turkey helps their cravings diminish after a few days; others find they may still crave sugar but over time are able to train their taste buds to be satisfied with less.</p>

<p><strong>Grab some gum.</strong> If you want to avoid giving in to a sugar craving completely, try chewing a stick of gum, says nutrition advisor Dave Grotto, RD, LDN. ""Research has shown that chewing gum can reduce food cravings,"" Grotto says.
Reach for fruit. Keep fruit handy for when sugar cravings hit. You'll get fiber and nutrients along with some sweetness. And stock up on foods like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, says certified addiction specialist Judy Chambers, LCSW, CAS. ""Have them handy so you reach for them instead of reaching for the old [sugary] something.""</p>

<p><strong>Get up and go.</strong> When a sugar craving hits, walk away. ""Take a walk around the block or [do] something to change the scenery,"" to take your mind off the food you’re craving, Neville suggests.</p>

<p><strong>Choose quality over quantity.</strong> ""If you need a sugar splurge, pick a wonderful, decadent sugary food,"" Moores says. But keep it small. For example, choose a perfect dark chocolate truffle instead of a king-sized candy bar, then ""savor every bite -- slowly,"" Moores says. Grotto agrees. ""Don’t swear off favorites -- you’ll only come back for greater portions. Learn to incorporate small amounts in the diet but concentrate on filling your stomach with less sugary and [healthier] options.""</p>

<p><strong>Eat regularly.</strong> Waiting too long between meals may set you up to choose sugary, fatty foods that cut your hunger, Moores says. Instead, eating every three to five hours can help keep blood sugar stable and help you ""avoid irrational eating behavior,"" Grotto says. Your best bets? ""Choose protein, fiber-rich foods like whole grains and produce,"" Moores says.</p>

<p>But won't eating more often mean overeating? Not if you follow Neville's advice to break up your meals. For instance, have part of your breakfast -- a slice of toast with peanut butter, perhaps -- and save some yogurt for a mid-morning snack. ""Break up lunch the same way to help avoid a mid-afternoon slump,"" Neville says.</p>

"Is mint oil an effective remedy for headaches?","93","","<p>Mint oil is often refered to as a remedy for headaches, especially for migraine. </p>

<p><strong>Are there studies and/or scientifical proof to back up the claim that mint oil is an effective remedy for headaches?</strong></p>
","<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>Peppermint oil combined with ethanol may be useful when applied topically for tension headaches.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>A review (Kligler) found two studies that looked at peppermint oil when combined with ethanol for the treatment of <strong>tension headache.</strong> They rated the evidence a ""B"" for <strong>""inconsistent  or  limited-quality  patient-oriented  evidence""</strong></p>

<p>In my own search I only found the same two studies listed in the review. The studies were placebo controlled, double blinded, and random crossover in design, so can be considered good quality experimental design, but they were limited in the number of subjects (one studied 32 patients and the other 41 patients). They did find that <strong>the topical application of peppermint oil and ethanol reduced headache severity.</strong></p>

<p>These studies only considered tension type headaches, so the results may not be applicable to other types of headaches.</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>
","<p>The recommendation to stop eating lemon and limes to prevent tooth decay is likely due to their acid content. </p>

<p>The primary nutritional benefits of citrus fruits are mainly vitamin C (ascorbic acid), <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/x2650T/x2650t03.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">though many other useful nutrients are also provided</a>.  Luckily, it appears that according to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847730/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research</a> the bio-availability of ""artificial"" vitamin C is not markedly reduced, and so supplements can be used.</p>

"How does a late term abortion work?","91","","<p>Imagine this situation: A woman is pregnant with a baby in the 8th month and the doctors notice the pregnancy is affecting the health of the woman - so there has to be an abortion, for it is sure that the baby will die in the birth process (so you don't have a chance to save the baby)
Which method of abortion can be used in this case and how exactly will the surgery be done?</p>
","<p>8th Month is ~ 32 Weeks, pregnancy is usually ~40 weeks</p>

<p>Up to 15 weeks' gestation, suction-aspiration or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion. (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112"" rel=""nofollow"">Healthwise, 2004</a>) Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary.</p>

<p>From the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. Dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) consists of opening the cervix of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by intact dilation and extraction (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called ""partial-birth abortion"", which has been federally banned in the United States. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Methods"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia, 2016</a>)</p>

<p><strong>In the third trimester of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by intact dilation and extraction or by hysterotomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.</strong> (<a href=""http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553899/Abortion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">McGee, Glenn; Jon F. Merz, 2009</a>)</p>

<p>In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary (<a href=""http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443"" rel=""nofollow"">Borgatta, L, 2014</a>). This is sometimes called ""induced miscarriage"". This procedure may be performed from <strong>13 weeks gestation to the third trimester</strong>. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries (<a href=""http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Society of Family Planning, 2011</a>).</p>

<p>Only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction(<a href=""http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Society of Family Planning, 2011</a>). Unlike D&amp;E, labor induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor induced abortion is legally risky in the U.S.(<a href=""http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Society of Family Planning, 2011</a>).</p>

<p>Note, unless there are severe medical complications, an induced birth will be the option because at 32 weeks there is a <a href=""http://www.spensershope.org/chances_for_survival.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">>95% chance</a> it will live. </p>

<p>I have, in the past, suffered from major depression, and while I learned to control this seemingly normal state of mind, it seems that much of my brain is still ""off"" leading me to believe that neuron firing in my brain may be inhibited.</p>

<p>Now, I have considered a number of methods for dealing with this problem amoung which are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>SSRIs: The problem doesn't seem to be seratonin deficiency, which prompted me to stop. </p></li>
<li><p>Marijuana: While it does help with the depressive mental states, it only replaces them with vegetative states which is not optimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Cocaine: Ruled out due to high costs and risk of addiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Various epinephrines: Ruled out due to the potential shut down of natural epinephrine production in the brain.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All these drugs are seemingly unworkable and in fact, music is the only thing capable of producing excitatory responses in my brain, though they happen rarely and seldom last for longer than a few hours, however the very fact that they happen may be indication that a more permanent excitatory state is possible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I would like to place what you've read thus far into context, I am not looking for a permanent ""high"" which you might associate with some of the aforementioned drugs, while that may be a dream state for a drug addict, it is not for me.
I am simply looking for methods with which I may increase the excitability of my neurons to a point which I deem acceptable for daily life.</p>

<p>Whether those methods include psychoactive drugs, psychtropic drugs, dietary plans, meditation or any other method I may have thus far not thought of.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would appreciate any scientifically founded information or useful methods on the matter.</p>
","<p><strong>What worked for me (and many others!) was exercise.</strong></p>

<p>After trying many antidepressants, I tried running. What got me motivated was an old article that I read about a clinical trial done by the University of Wisconsin around 1980. (Sorry, I could not find it today). IIRC, half of the group was given Prozac with no exercise, and the other half ran but was not given any pills. At the end of 10 weeks, the runners were less depressed than the other group.</p>

<p>After reading that, I decided to try running in the morning before work. I ran as far as I could until I was out of breath, and then walked back home. I made myself run a little further each time. One day, I could run much further; I didn't get out of breath, my legs just got tired. After only 6 weeks, I was amazed at how GOOD I felt! My depression and anxiety vanished. </p>

<p>You get a <em>runner's high</em> when you get in shape. That's a well known benefit.</p>

<p>Eventually, I regularly ran between 3 and 4 miles, 4 or 5 days a week after work. And I did that for several decades, before I slipped on some ice and injured my ankle and lower leg.</p>

<p>Before you try it, <em>educate yourself</em>. You can injure your feet without the correct technique (such as stretching your leg muscles beforehand) and suitable running shoes (I used Nikes). See an appropriate physician and read some good running/jogging books first! And if you feel real pain, stop running and just walk that day.</p>

<p>These days, I alternate walking with running. It does wonders for my mental health, as long as I can stay motivated.  </p>

"Too much sitting as bad as smoking?","91","","<p>I have heard that when you sit very long times every day that it is as bad for your health as smoking cigarettes. Especially, it is bad for your metabolism and especially the lungs get into a bad condition on an equal level. Is that true?</p>
","<p>If we compare the average increase in all-cause mortality due to sitting (approximately 50% according to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3827429/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meta-study</a> published on NHS) and the average all-cause mortality due to smoking (aproximately 300% increase according to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDC data</a>), siting does not appear to be nearly as bad.</p>

<p>Yet, because of how broadly you worded the question it is possible that smoking is not as bad as sitting. According to the same publication by CDC that I linked above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quitting smoking before the age of 40 reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related disease by about 90%.</p>

<p>Therefore, for smokers who quit before the age of 40 on average the all-cause mortality due to smoking would be just 30%, lower than 50% for caused by sitting.</p>

"What happens when a hemophiliac woman gets her period?","91","","<p>If there was a woman who is also a hemophiliac/bleeder, what happens when she gets her period? Does her condition affect said period in any way, and if so, how? Would it be troublesome (more than usual) for her, and would she have to face any serious issues?</p>
","<p>""Luckily"" haemophilia only occurs in men*; women may be carrier of the disease but their bleeding tendency is in general less severe.</p>

<p>However, haemophilia carriers and women with other bleeding disorders (such as von Willebrand disease or platelet problems, e.g. Glanzmann) may experience very heavy menstrual blood loss. In general the menstruation won't take more days, but the blood loss can be much more severe. This could lead to anaemia and <em>potentially</em> death.</p>

<p>To minimise this blood loss, one could suppress the period (e.g. oral contraceptives or an intra-uterine device). Other options would be administration of the part that's missing or malfunctioning (clotting factor or platelets) or blood transfusion to treat anaemia.</p>

<p>* based on the comments below I want to add that it is possible that a woman is a true haemophiliac, but that this is very rare. Haemophilia is an X-linked disorder; because men inherit XY one affected X chromosome will cause the disease. Women have XX, which means that they can ""compensate"" the effect of one affected X chromosome by the activity of the other X chromosome. She is then a carrier of the disease: there is a 50-50 chance of her son (to whom she gives one X) is a haemophiliac. A woman could inherit two affected X chromosomes if her father is a haemophiliac and her mother is a carrier (and inherits the affected X chromosome). This makes true haemophilia much more rare in women than in men.</p>

"Seeking advice on dubious Pregnancy","90","","<p>A girl i slept with recently is pregnant and insists that i am the father, however her dates do not seem to match up for her or myself and the fact that it is mine is very much in doubt for me.</p>

<p>The facts are:</p>

<ul>
<li>She was in a relationship with her ex boyfriend up until the 26/27th december 2016.</li>
<li>We slept together the 5th and 10th of january 2017.</li>
<li>Her last period was on or around the 23rd. We both tried to work out possible conception dates and came up with dates a week or two before we actually slept together. A midwife came to the same conclusion.</li>
<li>The ultrasound scan taken 13/03/2017 said she was 12 weeks along</li>
</ul>

<p>She is refusing to go to a midwife with me to figure this out. 
Can a medical professional or someone with experience in these things please tell me what the likelihood of me being the father is based on the facts.</p>
","<p>The gestational age as given by the ultrasound tells how far the pregnancy is from the last menstrual period (not the conception date). According to <a href=""http://www.ultrasoundcare.com.au/services/pregnancy-ultrasound-5-17-weeks-dating-and-viability.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.ultrasoundcare.com.au/services/pregnancy-ultrasound-5-17-weeks-dating-and-viability.html</a>, first trimester ultrasounds are generally within 3-5 days of accuracy if performed during the first 8-11 weeks and about 10 days accurate if performed in 12th-22nd wks of pregnancy.</p>

<p>Let's break down your dates for a clearer picture. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>UTZ date: Mar 13</strong></li>
<li><strong>Age of Gestation:12 weeks</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this ultrasound, her LMP should be around Dec 9 (give or take 10 days), and the baby was conceived sometime around Dec 23 (give or take 10 days). So from the ultrasound, you can infer the ff:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Possible LMP dates: Nov 30 - Dec 19</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Possible conception dates based on UTZ: Dec 13 - Jan 2</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember though that these dates are just estimates and are only based on what the statistics are of the general population. </p>

<p>Her LMP, as you said, was around Dec 23, which is only four days from the estimated possible LMP; so the LMP she is declaring is very much plausible. If we follow her LMP and we assume that her menses are regular in length as with the general population, we can assume that the conception happened around 14days from that period (give or take).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>LMP: Dec 23</strong></li>
<li><strong>Possible date of conception based on LMP: Jan 6 (+/-5days) so January 1 to Jan 11</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So let's go to the final question:</p>

<p>Are you the father? Based on her LMP, it's possible.</p>

<p>Are you not the father? It's also possible. You haven't given us other details about this scenario. Are you the only person she's sleeping with at that time? Is she sure about her LMP? </p>

<p>So what should you do to be sure? From where I'm from, a paternity test could be requested. You can request this after the baby is delivered or while the baby is still in utero (although this latter suggestion has some risks involved). I'm not very sure though about how your relationship can be tilted with you requesting this and how the mother would take this suggestion. Good luck and I hope you can talk this through and sort this out soon.</p>

","<p>Cyanosis occurs when the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin is high (greater than 5g/dL), because deoxyhaemoglobin absorbs differing wavelengths of light than oxyhaemoglobin and looks bluer.</p>

<p>Central cyanosis occurs when there is high deoxyhaemoglobin levels in the arterial blood, caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shunt of deoxygenated blood into the systemic arteries</li>
<li>Impaired oxygen uptake through the alveolar membrane</li>
<li>High levels of overall haemoglobin overwhelming oxygen diffusing capacity (eg <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia_vera"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">polycythaemia rubra vera</a>)</li>
<li>Low delivery of blood to the alveolar capillaries</li>

<ul>
<li>Localised low blood supply (eg peripheral vasoconstriction)</li>

He says it is healthier to eat the same meals spread apart throughout the day. Now to avoid comparing Apples to Ice Cream, let's say the 3 meal diet and the 6 meal diet contains the same food in the same quantity. Will the 6 meals really be healthier than the 3? And what are the actual health benefits of the 6 meal diet oppose to eating the same food in 3 meals?</p>
","<p>Both these schedules, ie., 3 meals a day and 6 meals a day, can work well for different type of people.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the benefits of eating 3 meals a day first</p>

<p>This schedule often works well for most of us in the long term as we are used to the breakfast-lunch-dinner that we eat at home. Mostly, people do not want to eat immediately upon waking up (generally it’s a couple of hours after waking up). More often than not, most of us do not feel like eating after breakfast till it is lunchtime. Three-meal schedule allows you to eat bigger meals and this is where six meals a day theory becomes a problem for those who love to eat big and are trying to lose weight. Six small meals will never make you feel that you have eaten enough; you might feel like you are just snacking and it makes you crave for more. So, three-meal schedule teaches you to take control of your hunger better whereas eating six times a day tends to make you eat more, as you end up eating every 2-3 hours irrespective of the fact that you are hungry or not. </p>

<p>Now, let’s look at the benefits of 6-meals-a-day schedule </p>

<p>It could be an ideal plan when you are required to a lot of calories to gain weight or if you are a sports person who burns a lot of calories. Also, it’s something you want to follow if you are someone who needs to consume high amounts of protein as our body can only assimilate and absorb between 30-40 grams of quality protein per meal. Therefore, this schedule is ideal for people who want to limit protein intake to about 15-40 grams per meal. Another benefit of 6-meal-a-day plan is when you are required to consume large amounts of carbs. It can also help you to maintain your sugar levels. For some, especially diabetics, it could be a tough ask to go on for more than 3-4 hours without eating anything and smaller frequent servings would work well to maintain stable energy/sugar levels.</p>

<p><em>Yellow Fever</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus, and the mosquito is the primary vector. It carries the virus from one host to another, primarily between monkeys, from monkeys to humans, and from person to person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yellow fever can cause high fevers and jaundice. It's responsible for an estimated 30,000 deaths a year, out of 200,000 infections. Numbers are increasing, and about 900 million people live in countries where they are at risk. Yellow fever is not chronic. </p>

<p><em>Rift Valley Fever</em></p>

<p>Transmission through mosquitos isn't the primary source of infection for Rift Valley Fever - it is mostly transmitted through </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a few more mentioned at the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/list_mosquitoborne.htm"">CDC list for mosquito-borne diseases</a>, for example:</p>

<p><em>Japanese Encephalitis</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, meaning it is related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This affects 24 countries with about 70,000 cases being treated each year, up to 30 percent of which result in death. Japanese Encephalitis is not chronic. </p>

<p><em>Chikungunya</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The virus is transmitted from human to human by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Most commonly, the mosquitoes involved are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, two species which can also transmit other mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This disease had several large outbreaks in Africa within the last two decades. Since 2005, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases. Some patients develop chronic joint pain. </p>

"Why do people still get hungry if they're overweight","89","","<p>So, I recently learned about how exactly obesity is formed. I learned that if you consume too many calories but don't burn enough of them, your body will start to form fat. Then how come that people still get hungry even if they have plenty of engergy stored by fat? </p>

<p>In other words; Why does the body still need extra food even though it has plenty of energy?</p>
","<p>Hunger is far more complicated than ""my weight is below normal for my height, I should eat now."" It's not some sort of correction mechanism that turns on and off to make your weight go up and down.</p>

<p>On a first approximation, you feel hungry because your stomach is empty and/or your blood sugar is low. People can drink water or eat lettuce to fill up their stomachs, and that works a little. Often, if you eat something very high in sugar, not mediated by anything slower to digest, you will be even hungrier afterwards because of your body's insulin response. The web is full of ""foods that make you hungry"", ""what to do instead of eating when you're hungry"" and such like, some of which have a grain of truth in them, and that certainly demonstrate how complicated hunger is in humans.</p>

<p>Studies have been done showing that people can get hungry for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with their current weight. Here's <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3894001/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a review</a> of various papers relating to insulin levels and cognitive factors such as looking at or thinking about food.</p>

"Wound care specialist says “it has healed too much, now it can’t heal”","89","","<p>I had three surgeries this summer, the last surgery was 11 weeks ago. The incision is small, about 2 inches, and started to heal fine at one end. The other end rejected 3 stitches which were pulled and drained for 3-4 weeks. Since, the wound has been healing very slowly (it is still bleeding slowly and is open). The surgeon has said that it is progressing the entire time, but progress has been very slow. They recommended me to a wound care office. </p>

<p>Yesterday at the wound care office they treated the unhealed part with Silver Nitrate and prescribed a silver based ointment to put under their bandage. </p>

<p>When I pressed the doctor on what was happening that slowed the healing process and required the nitrate treatment, she wouldn’t give any specifics. She only said “the wound has healed too much, and now it can’t heal anymore without knocking it back first.” I asked for more details and got a similar response back. </p>

<p>Can anyone give me some clarification as to the biological process going on and what the nitrate treatment is supposed to accomplish? </p>

<p>Thanks  </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>“the wound has healed too much, and now it can’t heal anymore without knocking it back first.” I asked for more details and got a similar response back. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talking to patients is an art. This doctor lacks that art to some extent.</p>

<p>Wounds left to heal on their own - without stitches - heal by <a href=""http://woundeducators.com/three-types-of-wound-closure/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>secondary intention</em></a>, that is, the wound fills in with a temporary tissue called granulation tissue. The best outcome is that enough granulation tissue is laid down to cover the wound, then, within the tissue, the normal components of skin, such as epithelial tissue and blood vessels grow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epithelialization and neovascularization result from the increase in cellular activity. Stromal elements in the form of extracellular matrix materials are secreted and organized. This new tissue, called granulation tissue, depends on specific growth factors for further organization to occur in the completion of the healing process. This physiologic process occurs over several weeks to months in a healthy individual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this is somewhat of a ""dance"" dependent on how much of what kinds of signals the injured tissue sends out, and sometimes the granulation tissue grows too much, and actually impedes the process of epithelialization. In that case, the excess granulation tissue (or even all of it) needs to be removed so the process can start over (the process is dependent on the right amount of the right signals (e.g. growth factors). </p>

<p>This is what was meant by the doctor.</p>

<p>As to why silver nitrate was used, it destroys granulation tissue, but so does just picking it off and other methods.</p>

<p>Your wound specialist really should have this talk down pat enough to give the answer in under a minute. But patients ask questions, and time is getting shorter and shorted for doctors to spend with patients (blame insurance companies for that.) So one way to save time is to avoid answering questions. You'll heal just as well without the information, but it doesn't engender much trust in the doctor.</p>

"Are there studies of detriments to using deodorants?","88","","<p>Specifically, I'm looking at Old Spice and Axe sprays. The labels warn that users should not inhale the fragrance (ironic given its purpose), but what are the consequences of prolonged inhalation?</p>
","<p>I can't speak for Old Spice, but Lynx/Axe is basically just a solution of perfume in ethanol. The ethanol kills the skin bacteria that generate the malodour (though the population quickly recovers!) and the perfume just makes you smell nice.</p>

<p>Pure/concentrated ethanol will destroy cell membranes, which is how it kills skin bacteria, so it's more dangerous than its widespread use in drinks would suggest (though fortunately diluting ethanol with water greatly reduces the damage to cell membranes). The solvent in Axe is about 95% ethanol and this is concentrated enough to cause damage. There isn't very much ethanol in a typical few seconds of spray, but I suppose if you pointed the can up your nose and inhaled as you sprayed you might cause some real damage. I suspect the intense pain it causes would mean most people will do this only once!</p>

<p>But I would guess the most dangerous ingredient in the deodorant is the perfume. Perfumes are an unholy mixture of terpenes, alcohols, ketones and lots of other stuff, and many of these chemicals are irritating to skin. Handling flasks of pure perfume is done in a fume cupboard with gloves and protective eye wear. Getting any large amount of perfume onto a mucous membrane like the eyes, throat or lungs would cause irritation and pain. But again, the amount of perfume in a few seconds of spray is small and you'd have to work at it to do yourself any serious harm.</p>

<p>I suspect the warnings not to breathe the spray are largely just being cautious and/or a way of being protected from being sued. Though in principle the contents of the spray can cause harm this would take exceptional circumstances, and even then the result is likely to be local irritation rather than any serious damage.</p>

<p><strong>Later:</strong></p>

<p>To my considerable surprise I have found a <a href=""https://www.menards.com/msds/113571_001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">safety data sheet for Axe deodorant online</a> (note that this is a 55KB PDF). The sheet gives the formulation though it omits the perfume concentration. I would guess this is because the perfume concentration is below the level where it has to be disclosed. The section on toxicology states:</p>

"Can you measure insulin resistance?","88","","<p>I want to know whether insulin resistance can be quantified. If so, does this quantification allow us to compare different individuals? Does it allow us to compare insulin resistance in one individual at different moments in time or under different circumstances? What sort of clinical test/exam/measurement is necessary?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://insulinnation.com/treatment/medicine-drugs/beyond-bmi-and-a1c-measuring-insulin-resistance/"">InsulinNation</a> gives a good overview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pre-diabetes can exist for a long time in your body without triggering the most common outward signs of diabetes (continual thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, etc). And standard methods of detecting insulin resistance or pre-diabetes using glucose tolerance tests or an A1C percentage often show false negatives; that’s because the pancreas is still able to produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is also good at hiding itself; it is common that someone diagnosed as a Type 2 has already had the disease for five years, which makes the battle for control an uphill climb even before it begins.</p>
  
  <p>Fortunately, there are other ways to identify insulin resistance using biomarkers in blood drawn from patients as a normal part of an annual or semi-annual general checkup. These biomarker data can be plotted against what is considered normal, and as a result, place the person at a specific point along the path to pre-diabetes or to Type 2 diabetes itself.</p>
  
  <p>Tools to detect insulin resistance include</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Tests showing the degree of pancreatic output and what could be defined as “pancreatic stress”. These include both fasting insulin and fasting glucose, a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) that measures beta cell function and insulin sensitivity, a C-Peptide test and a pro-insulin test;</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements of lipid hormones such as leptin and adiponectin. These biomarkers can give insight into a person’s unique communication between fat metabolism and insulin.</p></li>
<li><p>Tests that evaluate a person’s degree of inflammation.These biomarkers include a cardiac-specific C-reactive protein measurement (CRP) and a sedimentation rate.</p></li>

"How long does it take for a body to get rid of blood clots and bubbles inside a cannula?","88","","<p>The blood clots and the small bubbles that are stuck inside my cannula enters my body. I asked a doctor and he said its OK if the bubbles are small and clots are not dangerous.</p>

<p>My question is: Are these bubbles and clots accumulate each day? Will they become dangerous in few days? Is body able to get rid of them? </p>

<p>How long does it take to have a healthy (good) blood again?</p>

<p>Thank you very much,</p>
","<p>First, notice that bubbles are stopped by the drip chamber on the IV, or if there's an infusion pump instead of a drip chamber, the pump itself will detect it and stop the flow.</p>

<p>If there is a small bubble or two in the line after the drip chamber or pump, notice that it doesn't go anywhere. It just sits there and doesn't move with the fluid so it never enters your vein.</p>

<p>If the person administering the IV made the serious mistake of not allowing fluid to fill the entire line before attaching it to you, it would still require a very large volume of air to do you any harm, on the order of 100 ml (an entire syringe full of air). This is because bubbles can't travel from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation where they would be dangerous. They will be trapped by the lungs and then slowly reabsorbed. A huge volume of air could cause a ""vapor lock"" in the right ventricle, which would be dangerous, but small bubbles in an IV are nowhere near enough to do that.</p>

<p>The exception to the above would be in people who have a patent foramen ovale (an opening between the right and left sides of the heart), which could allow air bubbles to pass from right to left. However, a patent foramen ovale is normally covered by a flap of tissue except when you bear down hard. So if you're just laying there in a bed, there is virtually no risk presented to you by air bubbles.</p>

<p>Having a small bubble or two in your venous circulation doesn't make your blood unhealthy or ""bad."" They're harmless and will be absorbed and disappear within hours.</p>

","<p>Using these ""visuals"" is mostly a way for <em>you</em> to better understand and present the situation and condition of the patient. These preparations should help you to have everything ready and accessible when asked for by your doctor.</p>

<p>The first problem with these pictures is indeed that they are a first draw and that they might get streamlined into a cleaner illustration. That means having printed text in a consistent design.</p>

<p>The anatomical aspects are only helpful to you, an analog watch seems unnecessary, so from an cognitive ergonomics perspective (your UX part) I'd separate  this onto the left side of a two facing pages design.</p>

<p>It depends on many different things how well this will go: first thing to consider is the practitioner you visit and her preferences. Some really do not like being buried in details while others delight in as much detail as is possible and really devour files and information presented <em>in that style</em>.</p>

<p>Prepare two identical brochures. One for you, one to present the doctor. She may then chose to use it or to ignore it and you can still refer to it in your answers to the anamnestic questions she will have on top of what you present to her.</p>

<p>That <em>style</em> is the key part here:</p>

<p>Doctors are trained to make the best of their and your time to cut to the chase efficiently and effectively. Taking a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">medical history</a> and proceeding to  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagnosis</a> to arrive at a possible treatment.</p>

<p>The doctor chooses to read through the stuff you have prepared not only based on her preferences, but also on the current situation and setting. But further, how well presented your info is. That means two different but interconnected things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the guidelines other <a href=""https://www.google.de/search?q=example%20medical%20history%20form"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doctors or institutions use</a> in what to include, when to include and where to include it in the flow of information.</li>
<li>Choose a consistent layout with a clear hierarchy of information to present (headlines, paragraphs etc.; aim for minimalism).</li>
</ol>

<p>One <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history#Process"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a> is in the Wikipedia article, since it is not really suited to this case, there are <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/specialty_areas/moods/patient_information/docs/Pt_medi_history_form.doc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">others</a> to orient your file design and content on.  Another might go as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>S</strong>   Symptoms: especially pain and discomfort. 
  When did it start, what hurts, where does it hurt, how did it proceed, how long, how intense did it hurt etc. <br></li>
  <li><strong>A</strong> Allergies: known, confirmed or suspected<br></li>
  <li><strong>M</strong> Medications: This includes really everything he takes or took: prescribed meds as well as self-chosen over the counter meds, supplements, unusual dietary habits or ingredients. These need to be clearly listed in one place, possibly ordered in tables if they are many. Every medication, every supplement, herb, vitamin, mineral. (Everything that has an effect likely has side effects and maybe interactions.)<br>
  <br></li>
  <li><strong>P</strong> Patient's history: Prior illnesses and conditions, previous diagnosis or treatments. For example hypertension, diabetes, operations etc.

<p>May I use the techniques I am certified for here in other countries without legal issues? I'm not so much speaking about civil issues, but penal, as I could be considered non-certified outside my country. </p>
","<p>It does differ from country to country. For example, in France (As I'm sure you are aware), if a person <em>fails</em> to render assistance to a person in danger then they can by held liable. This falls under the ""duty to rescue"" concept.</p>

<p>Here in the United States (and elsewhere), this is covered by something called the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law"">Good Samaritan Law</a>"", which is intended to remove the fear of litigation preventing someone from aiding another in times of distress.</p>

<p>However, it is not a blanket immunity from someone suing. One of the concepts that I was taught when I was a first responder and ER medic in the Armed Forces, is that you are pretty much safe if you act in a manner consistent with either your own training or the training of the general person on the street.</p>

<p>While it is not a guarantee, if you stick within the scope of your training and provide assistance, then you should pretty much be protected. You may still be sued, as there is no bar against a lawsuit being brought, but the Samaritan concept should protect you.</p>

<p>Note, this is not something that covers everything. For example, I was trained and certified in starting IV fluids. US protocol, however, provides that this can only be done when there is contact with a medical control available, and transport to a facility. If I came upon a hiking accident and whipped out an IV, I could still be held liable since that is out of protocol, and I would be considered to be acting outside the scope of common practice.</p>

<p>If you are traveling, your best bet is to look up the laws of emergency responders in the country you are going to. In some countries if it becomes known that you have the certification and you passed by an accident, you can then be held liable and possibly removed from certification because you failed in your duty to act.</p>

  <p><strong>Laughter triggers the release of endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good chemicals</strong>. Endorphins promote an overall sense of well-being and can even temporarily relieve pain.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Laughter protects the heart</strong>. Laughter improves the function of blood vessels and increases blood flow, which can help protect you against a heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Laughter burns calories</strong>. OK, so it’s no replacement for going to the gym, but one study found that laughing for 10 to 15 minutes a day can burn about 40 calories—which could be enough to lose three or four pounds over the course of a year.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Laughter lightens anger’s heavy load</strong>. Nothing diffuses anger and conflict faster than a shared laugh. Looking at the funny side can put problems into perspective and enable you to move on from confrontations without holding onto bitterness or resentment.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Laughter may even help you to live longer</strong>. A study in Norway found that people with a strong sense of humor outlived those who don't laugh as much. The difference was particularly notable for those battling cancer.</p>

<p>Other internet sites including <a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/laughter-cure-illness.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How Stuff Works — Science</a> states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Laughter sets off a chain reaction throughout the body that promotes physical and psychological health. Regular and frequent guffawing can both prevent illness and help you get well. Laughter lowers your body's hormone and cortisol levels. (Cortisol is a stress-induced chemical that can lead to heart disease, high blood pressure and excess belly fat.) Laughter also strengthens your immune system because it increases the production of antibodies in your saliva and in your bloodstream to stave off bacteria, viruses and parasites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laughter also helps with skin conditions. People suffering from eczema noted improvement in their complexions after consistently watching funny movies. When allergy patients laugh regularly, it reportedly shrinks their welts (<a href=""http://www.jpsychores.com/article/S0022-3999(08)00290-0/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kimata, 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Some cancer treatment centres incorporate laughter therapy sessions into a patient's treatment plan to increase the positive thinking and happy feelings that support the healing process (<a href=""http://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CTCA, n.d.</a>)</p>

<p>As for laughter curing diabetes, I don't know about curing diabetes, but as How Stuff Works — Science states that laughter reduces cortisol levels which can lead to excess belly fat <a href=""http://www.health.com/health/condition-article/0,,20188164,00.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">getting rid of belly fat may lower Type 2 diabetes risk</a>.

"What's this about Chemical-Warfare?! Nerve agents?!

I haven't heard of it... and apparently not very many others have as well? </p>

<p>VX is part of a group of nerve-agents (organophosphates) that have been created and used as chemical warfare as ""weapons of mass deconstruction."" It can be diseminated via liquid or vapor that has neither scent nor taste, which makes it so terrifying. Watch and learn more about the history of VX <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0DXV210OhQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on the History Channel clip.</a></p>

<p>But I don't understand <strong><em>how VX differs from Sarin</em></strong> (another nerve-agent used for Chemical Warfare but possibly in Syria and Iraq)? I don't understand how they differ in their symptoms and manifesting themselves. </p>

<p>Why is VX so much more potent?</p>
","<p>Both are organo-phosphorous/phosphate compounds, and both act by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, leading to sustained muscle contraction and usually death by asphyxiation. </p>

<p>Sarin however is much less stable due to the phosphorus-fluorine bond being easily broken by water or basic/nucleophilic materials.  The products of this hydrolysis are relatively non-toxic phosphonic acids.  Not all of the VX hydrolysis products appear to be fully non-toxic, which likely adds to it's designation as ""deadliest"".</p>

<p>Additionally, there's the measured LD50 of the two, with Sarin being 172 μg/kg (rat, intravenous) and VX being <em>only 7 µg/kg</em>.  I don't know the exact chemical reasons for this, but one could assume the differences in structure lead to different and possibly more efficient binding affinity for VX or some other ""advantageous"" feature that makes it so deadly.</p>

<p>And finally, the two agents have different levels of volatility.  Sarin is much more volatile, and so can be ""cleared"" much more easily.  VX is likely to stick around in contaminated materials since it doesn't evaporate out of them as easily, and this could arguably make it more ""deadly"" over time.</p>

"Afterload during Cardiac failure?","87","","<p>So one of the clinical signs of Cardiac insufficiency is a low blood pressure, and to treat cardiac insufficiency we try to decrease the Afterload.
what I don't get is that the Afterload is defined as being the force that opposes cardiac ejection and is represented by the blood pressure, and during Cardiac insufficiency we have a low blood pressure doesn't that mean the Afterload is already low ?? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: When treating cardiac insufficiency the key focus is increasing stroke volume. To do this we don't just decrease afterload but we also lower preload and sometimes increase contractility.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong></p>

<p>So cardiac insufficiency is all about cardiac output (CO) and CO = stroke volume(SV)* heart rate (HR). The key problem in cardiac insufficiency is the lowered stroke volume, i.e. the amount of blood that is ejected from the heart on each heartbeat. HR can sometimes be relevant but let's focus on the SV for now.</p>

<p>SV is mostly dictated by three factors afterload, preload and contractility. The Frank-Starling mechanism regulates the relationship between these factors. </p>

<p>There is an inverse relationship between afterload, the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to eject blood, and stroke volume that is represented by the force/tension curve. So in the setting of cardiac insufficiency and high blood pressure the lowering of afterload is key.</p>

<p>There is however a more complex relationship between preload and stroke volume. Stroke volume increases with increased preload up until a certain threshold where the preload pulls the sarcomeres of the cardiac muscles to wide. At this point increased preload decreases the stroke volume even further. This is sometimes referred to as the Starling mechanism (see fig 1). In the setting of fluid overload as we see in cardiac insufficiency blood backs up in the pulmonary blood stream leading to increased preload to the point where it is so high as to decrease the stroke volume. This is where decreasing preload is helpful in increasing stroke volume.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> The Starling mechanism (note that Ventricular end-diastolic volume is</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2AJin.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2AJin.jpg"" alt=""The Sterling Mechanism""></a></p>

<p>The relationship between preload and stroke volume is even further determined by the hearts contractility. An increased contractility leads to a greater increase in stroke volume with each unit of preload (see fig 2). In cardiac insufficiency contractility is usually decreased leading to lower stroke volume in relation to preload. Sometimes, especially in a critical care environment contractility is increased by giving inotropic medication.</p>

<p>So when we treat cardiac insufficiency we can manipulate all those factors to alleviate the key problem of a low stroke volume.</p>

"Can the cysteine from onions assimilated by the body?","87","","<p>I read somewhere that cysteine is present in onions. But my teacher told me that the cysteine in onions is denatured by the harsh stomach acids. Is this true? If not , are onions viable source of cysteine for a healthy person?</p>
","<p>Cysteine is an amino acid. It is true that it is denaturated in the stomach, but this means only its secondary structure (""shape""), but not the chemical bonds, are changed. So, the cysteine from onions will be absorbed as proper cysteine.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any special health benefits of cysteine in otherwise healthy individuals, though.</p>

<p>Also, vegetables are in general low in protein and hence in cysteine. They are high-protein foods (meat, fish, eggs, nuts) that are <a href=""https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report/nutrientsfrm?max=25&amp;offset=0&amp;totCount=0&amp;nutrient1=507&amp;nutrient2=&amp;nutrient3=&amp;subset=0&amp;sort=c&amp;measureby=m"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high in cysteine</a>. </p>

<p>(NOTE: There is a typo in USDA.gov: they have wrongly written cystine instead of cysteine)</p>

<p><em>N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)</em> is a supplement that acts as a ""prodrug"" for L-cysteine, which means NAC is converted to cysteine in your body.  </p>

<p>It is true that cysteine is converted to glutathione and more cysteine would provide more glutathione. But ""more glutathione"" as such is not already better for health. Further, you would need to know which exact health effect you want to achieve.</p>

<p>My conclusion: Although, onions are viable, they are relatively poor source of cysteine.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A switch of emphasis occurred early in the 1900s from promoting corn flakes as a health food to a breakfast food that ‘tastes good’. This occurred especially after barley malt extract and sugar were added to enhance the flavor of the basic toasted corn flakes. Cereal producers in those early 1900s also turned to prominent artists to paint scenes of ‘the wholesome life situations’ that always included the product being advertised in a prominent position. […]<br><br>
  Market forces also drove the quest for more nutritious cereals. The emphasis was aimed at stressing the importance of breakfast as the day’s most important meal in a world whose pace was beginning to accelerate faster and faster. A ‘vitamin’s horsepower’ race soon evolved where manufacturers and marketers tried to outdo each other with vitamin additions and marketing strategies. […]<br><br>
  We will limit our discussion here on liquids blending to the four basic flavor materials; water, sugar, salt and malt. The workhorse mixing vessel for these has been, and still is, the steam jacketed kettle. Liquid sucrose, dry salt, and liquid malt extract are slurried in water in a kettle equipped with agitation, and a steam jacket sufficient in capacity to heat the mix to 125°F (52°C). This is a high enough temperature to make a good useable slurry of such viscosity for ease of handling.

<p>Cornflakes are not 98% corn. Just using dry weight ratios of the finished product: The amount of salt, malt and sugar alone is above 10%. Another  ""official"" recipe for typical corn flakes is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Formulation:</strong>
  The basic raw material for the traditional corn flake is derived from the dry milling of regular field corn. Dry milling removes the germ and the bran from the kernel, and essentially what is left is chunks of endosperm. The size needed for corn flakes is one half to one third that of the whole kernel. […]<br><br>
  A typical formula for corn flakes is as follows: corn grits, 100 lb (45 kg); granulated sugar, 6lb (3.7 kg); malt syrup, 2lb (1 kg); salt, 2lb (1 kg); and water sufficient to yield cooked grits with a moisture content of not more than 32% after allowing for steam condensate.

</blockquote>

<p>Compared to the corn going into these machines: Fibre content removed, heated several times, sugar and carbohydrates ratio increased. Everything pulverised and only afterwards baked together into something resembling solid food. Although on a much lower level this is of course also true for anything grain based, like good old bread, the level of processing is much higher in these flakes.</p>

<p>Further steps in processing: Mixing, Cooking, Dumping, Delumping, Drying, Cooling and Tempering, Flaking, Toasting, which then usually results in: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The moisture content of flakes is usually in the range of 1.5–3%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not bet your farm on these numbers, products differ in one and the same assembly line and even much more so in <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/76/1/5/T1.expansion.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">different markets</a>!</p>

<p>The amount of processing leads to some very minor enhancements in availability of the remaining nutrients, removal or destruction of many other nutrients:</p>

  The effects of different processing methods on nutrient content in maize, from field to plate, indicate that, generally, the fresher and less processed the maize is, the more nutrients it retains. […] Losses to micronutrients during processing can be mitigated by changes in processing methods or reduction in processing, and also by encouraging consumption of whole-grain maize products over degermed, refined products. When losses cannot be mitigated and populations consuming the product are at risk of specific micronutrient deficiencies, these can be potentially reduced through fortification </p>

<p>This leads to the gycemic index and its differences <em>even</em> in seemingly similar foods:</p>

<blockquote>

  […] It is also important to emphasize that many low-GI foods are relatively less refined than are their high-GI counterparts and are more difficult to consume. The lower energy density and palatability of these foods are important determinants of their greater satiating capacity. […]<br><br>
  <strong>WHY DO GI VALUES FOR THE SAME TYPES OF FOODS SOMETIMES VARY?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Many people have raised concerns about the variation in published GI values for apparently similar foods. This variation may reflect both methodologic factors and true differences in the physical and chemical characteristics of the foods. One possibility is that 2 similar foods may have different ingredients or may have been processed with a different method, resulting in significant differences in the rate of carbohydrate digestion and hence the GI value. Two different brands of the same type of food, such as a plain cookie, may look and taste almost the same, but differences in the type of flour used, in the moisture content, and in the cooking time can result in differences in the degree of starch gelatinization and consequently the GI values. In addition, it must be remembered that the GI values listed in the table for commercially available processed foods may change over time if food manufacturers make changes in the ingredients or processing methods used.</p>
  
  <p>Another reason GI values for apparently similar foods vary is that different testing methods are used in different parts of the world. Differences in testing methods include the use of different types of blood samples (capillary or venous), different experimental time periods, and different portions of foods (50 g of total rather than of available carbohydrate). Recently, 7 experienced GI testing laboratories around the world participated in a study to determine the degree of variation in GI values when the same centrally distributed foods were tested according to the laboratories’ normal in-house testing procedures (31). The results showed that the 5 laboratories that used finger-prick capillary blood samples to measure changes in postprandial glycemia obtained similar GI values for the same foods and less intersubject variation. Although capillary and venous blood glucose values have been shown to be highly correlated, it appears that capillary blood samples may be preferable to venous blood samples for reliable GI testing. After the consumption of food, glucose concentrations change to a greater degree in capillary blood samples than in venous blood samples. Therefore, capillary blood may be a more relevant indicator of the physiologic consequences of high-GI foods.</p>
  
  <p>Although it is clear that GI values are generally reproducible from place to place, there are some instances of wide variation for the same food. Rice, for example, shows a large range of GI values, but this variation is due to inherent botanical differences in rice from country to country rather than to methodologic differences. Differences in the amylose content could explain much of the variation in the GI values of rice (and other foods) because amylose is digested more slowly than is amylopectin starch (32). GI values for rice cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of the size of the grain (short or long grain) or the type of cooking method. Rice is obviously one type of food that needs to be tested brand by brand locally. Carrots are another example of a food with a wide variation in published GI values; the oldest study showed a GI of 92 ± 20 and the latest study a GI of 32 ± 5. However, the results of an examination of the SEs (20 compared with 5) and the number of subjects tested (5 compared with 8) suggest that the latest value for carrots is more reliable, although differences in nutrient content and preparation methods contributed somewhat to this variation.</p>
  
  <p>An important reason GI values for similar foods sometimes vary between laboratories is because of the method used for determining the carbohydrate content of the test foods. GI testing requires that portions of both the reference foods and test foods contain the same amount of available carbohydrate, typically 50 or 25 g. The available or glycemic carbohydrate fraction in foods, which is available for absorption in the small intestine, is measured as the sum of starch and sugars and does not include resistant starch. Most researchers rely on food-composition tables or food manufacturers’ data, whereas others directly measure the starch and sugar contents of the foods.</p>
  
  <p>This difference in the accuracy of measurements of the carbohydrate content might explain some of the variation in reported GI values for fruit and potatoes and other vegetables. Food labels may or may not include the dietary fiber content of the food in the total carbohydrate value, leading to confusion that can markedly affect GI values, especially those for high-fiber foods. Consequently, researchers should obtain accurate laboratory measurements of the available carbohydrate content of foods as an essential preliminary step in GI testing. The available carbohydrate portion of test and reference foods should not include resistant starch, but, in practice, this can be difficult to ensure because resistant starch is difficult to measure. There is also difficulty in determining the degree of availability of novel carbohydrates, such as sugar alcohols, which are incompletely absorbed at relatively high doses.</p>
  
  <p>Measuring the rate at which carbohydrates in foods are digested in vitro has been suggested as a cheaper and less time-consuming method for predicting the GI values of foods (33). However, only a few foods have been subjected to both in vitro and in vivo testing, and it is not yet known whether the in vitro method is a reliable indication of the in vivo postprandial glycemic effects of all types of foods. It is possible that some factors that significantly affect glycemia in vivo, such as the rate of gastric emptying, will not change the rate of carbohydrate digestion in vitro. For example, high osmolality and high acidity or soluble fiber slow down the gastric emptying rate and reduce glycemia in vivo, but they may not alter the rate of carbohydrate digestion in vitro. It is difficult to mimic all of the human digestive processes in a test tube. In fact, research results from our laboratory have shown that GI values measured in vivo can be significantly different for the same foods measured in vitro. Until we know more about the validity of in vitro methods, it is not recommended that they be used in clinical or epidemiologic research applications or for food labeling purposes because of the potential for large over- or underestimates of true GI values.</p>

<p>As any grain from grasses maize <em>needs</em> some form of processing to be really palatable and nutritious for humans. Corn flakes may be actually one of the better choices among those horrid cereals, being relatively low in added sugar compared to other cereals and mainly raising concerns for their high amount of salt. But the destructive processing removes the taste along with the vitamins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/23/food-book-extract-felicity-lawrence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The managing director of Kellogg's Europe Tony Palmer confessed that 'if we'd known you could take out 25 per cent of the salt and make cornflakes taste even better, we would have done it earlier. But it's also about the interaction with the sugar – as you take the salt out, you've got to reduce the sugar because it starts to taste sweeter.' But isn't the target to reduce sugar consumption too? Why not just cut down on salt and sugar, we wondered. Well, sugar helps keep the crispness and is part of the bulk, so that would be difficult, we were told. Mr Palmer's eyebrows started working furiously as he answered: 'And the risk is, if you take the salt out you might be better off eating the cardboard carton for taste,' he said.</a> </p>

I would have thought though that adding salt to your water while loading up for a fast day would help you absorb more of it because it will counteract some of the water (meaning it will say in you and not be excreted). </p>

<p>How should one consume salt and water in the days leading up to a fast?</p>
","<p>OK, so this seems to be a 24 hour fast.</p>

<p>Salt (sodium) and glycerol, after drinking water, prolong the time in which the water is excreted from the body, but they both work only for few hours. </p>

<p>The idea of hyperhydration to delay dehydration sounds interesting for marathon runners (in order to avoid the need to drink during the race), but according to <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2007/02000/Exercise_and_Fluid_Replacement.22.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American College of Sports Medicine</a>, only few hours after hyperhydration, you will likely lose the excessive water.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attempting to hyperhydrate with fluids that expand of the extra- and
  intracellular spaces (e.g., water and glycerol solutions) will greatly
  increase the risk of having to void during competition...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glycerol can also have side effects, such as diarrhea.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any nutrient, supplement or food that would keep the water in your body in any meaningful manner in a 24-hour fasting scenario.</p>

<p>The effect of fasting is that you <em>feel</em> the lack of benefit of food. The resulting hunger can then remind you of things, other than food, that are important for you. Resisting from food alone (while drinking water) can already have this effect. Hyperhydration before fasting would cancel the effect of resisting from water, so what's the point of this, anyway.</p>

<p>Saying that, I am not promoting or suggesting anyone to resist from drinking water for any amount of time, because it could be potentially health- or even life-threatening.</p>

<p>If one has to survive for 24 hours without water and food, the means to avoid dehydration can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep yourself well hydrated before fasting.</li>
<li>Avoid <a href=""https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6#133"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alcohol and caffeine</a> before fasting because they can promote the excretion of water through the urine.</li>
<li>Avoid/limit anything what promotes sweating, such as exercise, exposure to sun and excessive clothing.</li>

"Is 2nd hand smoking worse than 1st hand smoking","87","","<p>I have heard many things about smoking and a main issue as of one being that 2nd hand smoking is worse than 1st hand smoking itself? <strong>(I do not smoke I am just around someone who does smoke)</strong></p>

<p>Is this rumor true? If <em>so</em> why is this, and what should I do if I can smell it or if I am around them when they light the cigarette?</p>
","<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Yes, if one was to inhale the same amount of smoke passively as smokers inhale actively, it would be more dangerous. This is hardly the case though.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Risk of Second Hand Smoking</h2>

<p><strong>Risk of developing cancer</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exposure to secondhand smoke raises the risk -- <strong>by as much as 30 percent [1.3 times]</strong> -- that others will get lung cancer and many other types of cancer, it can lead to emphysema, and it is bad for your heart. </p>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/effects-of-secondhand-smoke"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebMD</a>, Emphasis Mine, Annotation Mine</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lower risk of developing cancer is because passive smokers don't inhale the same amount of smoke - you usually walk past a smoker and not stand right next to them until they have finished their cigarette.</p>

<p><strong>Inhalation of toxic fumes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are 2 types of tobacco smoke:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Mainstream smoke, which is directly inhaled through the mouth end of the cigarette </li>
  <li>Sidestream smoke, which comes from the burning tip of the cigarette </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Second-hand smoke is made up of sidestream smoke and
  exhaled mainstream smoke, mixed with the surrounding air.</p>
  
  <p>Sidestream smoke is about <strong>4 times more toxic than mainstream smoke,
  although people inhale it in a more diluted form</strong>. This is because
  sidestream smoke contains much higher levels of many of the poisons
  and cancer-causing chemicals in cigarettes, including:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>At least 3 times as much carbon monoxide</li>
  <li>10-30 times more nitrosamines</li>
  <li>Between 15–300 times more ammonia </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/smoking-and-cancer/passive-smoking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cancerreaserchuk.org</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the total amount of toxic fumes passive smokers inhale is less than what smokers inhale, because the former are not exposed to smoke as often as the latter.</p>

<p><strong>Risk of Developing Heart Diseases or Strokes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Breathing secondhand smoke can cause coronary heart disease, including
  heart attack and stroke. Know the facts:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Secondhand smoke causes nearly 34,000 early deaths from coronary    heart disease each year in the United States among 
  nonsmokers.</p></li>
  <li><p>Nonsmokers who <strong>breathe secondhand smoke at home or at work increase<br>
  their risk of developing heart disease by 25–30%.</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>Breathing secondhand smoke interferes with the normal functioning of    the heart, blood, and vascular systems in ways that increase
  your    risk of having a heart attack.</p></li>
  <li>Even briefly breathing secondhand smoke can damage the lining of    blood vessels and cause your blood to become stickier. These changes<br>
  can cause a deadly heart attack.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/heart-disease-stroke.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cdc.gov</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the risk is lower than the risk of smokers because it is <em>only</em> an exposure during work or at home and are not expected to inhale the same amount of smoke as bystanders as smokers do.</p>

<h2>Risks of smoking</h2>

<p><strong>Risk of developing cancer</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who smoke cigarettes are <strong>15 to 30 times more likely</strong> to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day, the more risk goes up.</p>

<p><strong>Toxic fumes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cigarette smoke is a mixture of over 4000 chemicals, many of which are
  harmful to the human body. All currently available tobacco products
  that are smoked deliver substantial amounts of toxic chemicals to
  their users and those who breathe their smoke.</p>
  
  <p>Of the more than 4000 chemicals present in cigarette smoke, more than
  60 have been identified as cancer causing chemicals, 11 of which are
  known to cause cancer in humans and 8 that probably cause cancer in
  humans.</p>
  
  <p>With approximately <strong>one non-smoker dying due to secondhand smoke
  exposure for every eight smokers dying</strong> of smoking-related disease it
  is no surprise that secondhand smoke has been designated a known human
  carcinogen (cancer-causing agent). Further, <strong>about half of regular
  smokers will die of a smoking-related disease</strong> and have a <strong>reduced life
  expectancy of about 13 to 16 years</strong> as compared with non- smokers.</p>

<p><strong>Risk of Heart Diseases and Strokes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you smoke, your chance of dying from a heart attack is <strong>2 to 3 times
  greater</strong> than that of a person who does not smoke. About <strong>1 out of 4
  heart attacks is believed to be directly related to smoking</strong>. Smoking
  is a much more important risk factor for a heart attack than high
  cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure, or stress.
  A person who smokes is twice as likely to die from a stroke as a person who does not smoke. </p>

<h2>If you have children</h2>

<p>Second hand smoking is especially damaging to children:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every day millions of children in the UK are exposed to secondhand
  smoke, which puts them at <strong>increased risk of lung disease, meningitis
  and cot death</strong>. Treatment, hospital and GP visits for secondhand smoke
  related illnesses cost the NHS more than £23.6 million each year.</p>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/childrens-health-up-in-smoke"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gov.uk</a>, Emphasis Mine</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Early exposure to chemicals is a lot more damaging than during adulthood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passive smoking causes lasting damage to children's arteries,
  prematurely ageing their blood vessels by more than three years, say
  researchers.</p>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-26432111"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BBC.com</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can lead to early heard attacks and other coronary diseases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exposure of unborn children to tobacco smoke may also increase the
  risk of miscarriage, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome
  (SIDS), or ‘cot death’. There is strong evidence that the babies of
  mothers who smoke after birth have more lung diseases in their first
  year of life and have double the normal risk of serious airway
  infections.</p>

<p>If you have kids, you definitely should follow the advice below.</p>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can protect yourself and your family from secondhand smoke by:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Quitting smoking if you are not already a nonsmoker</li>
  <li>Not allowing anyone to smoke anywhere in or near your home</li>
  <li>Not allowing anyone to smoke in your car, even with the windows down</li>
  <li>Making sure your children’s day care center and schools are tobacco-free</li>

"Testing intestinal flora in transverse colon","87","","<p>I have a theory that the transverse colon can be overpopulated with intestinal flora that, when fed sugar, overproduce CO<sub>2</sub> and cause bloating/pain specifically in and around the hepatic flexure.</p>

<p>Has this theory (or anything similar) been documented? I couldn't find any literature. </p>

<p>More importantly, how could this theory be vetted? A low sugar diet could be a candidate, but there are plenty of other sugar/metabolizing-related conditions that such a test would rule out as well (diabetes, etc.). I am looking for a way to target this particular theory. For example, perhaps the bacteria that typically colonizes the transverse colon gives off a particular byproduct that might be detectable with blood or urinalysis, etc.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>While I consider this hypothesis unlikely, but possible, there are things that could be done to investigate this idea directly (most likely at consuming a significant amount of personal funds if you are willing to find anyone to do them).</p>

<p>First, yes bloating or excessive intestinal gas disorders/diseases exists.  While not a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Journal_of_Gastroenterology"" rel=""nofollow"">great journal</a>, and one that uses industry standards that differ from more established guidelines, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25339827"" rel=""nofollow"">here is a review</a> that should be more approachable to the public.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious would be to look for excessive intestinal gasses.  This would be noted by increased <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence"" rel=""nofollow"">flatulence</a>, or if in an extreme case, a local build-up would be noticeable in a CT or X-ray.  The fact that it is not moving around, but staying in your upper right abdomen, would mean that a local build up would be more likely, and thus more likely to be found in radiology.  The fact that these tests were done, but did not yield results is evidence against the idea.</p>

<p>If you really want to test the output <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolome"" rel=""nofollow"">metabolome</a> of your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"" rel=""nofollow"">intestinal flora</a>, you're probably better suited to test the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound"" rel=""nofollow"">volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</a> found in your flatulence.  <a href=""http://www.enose.nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">A group</a> in the Netherlands, who own the design to a particular <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_nose"" rel=""nofollow"">electronic nose</a> called <a href=""http://www.enose.nl/rd/technology/"" rel=""nofollow"">eNose</a>, published the idea of <a href=""http://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v6/i4/111.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">using feacal volatiles to</a> ""considerably improve screening, diagnosis and disease monitoring for gastro-intestinal diseases.""</p>

<p>This is certainly not an FDA approved method, and again it was published in the same low-impact journal that caters to companies publishing about their own tech.  The idea has merit, however a large database of samples correlated with successful diagnoses via other means would need to be established before this was of any practical use.</p>

<p>Finally, biopsies and swabs of the colon could be taken during an endoscopy, and the microbes present could be tested for.  This could be compared to some growing databases of individual microbiomes from NIH's <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/43021"" rel=""nofollow"">Human Microbiome Project</a>.</p>

<p>I do not think that trying to starve your gut flora via lower sugar diet is likely to have any noticeable effects.  Your GI specialist would have recommended any diagnostic diets to try if there was a likely test that could have been done (all liquid for example).  Testing feacal volatiles or comparing your microbiome would be human medical research/experiments at best (beyond the care you would be able to get in most countries outside of a medical study like <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/212594"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>).</p>

<p>Under the assumption that you are asking this here, that you are not interested in other diagnoses, and your other questions regarding polyps and GERD, I'm going to assume that this a theory that your GI specialist didn't put forward or one they didn't agree with.  They should be able to screen for the causes of your pain if it arises from an issue with your GI tract.  On the idea that they haven't (and therefore this specific hypothesis), <strong>I would highly suggest you seek treatment from a pain specialist, to test for things <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"" rel=""nofollow"">neuropathic pain</a></strong>.</p>

"What happens to a woman if she takes testosterone?","87","","<p>I'm interested in the changes that happen to the female body (let's say this person is 20) in the short (year one to five) and in the long term (20+ years).</p>

<p>Let's assume that the dose of testosterone is high enough to reach the typical levels that a man has. </p>

<p>Are there any studies, especially for the long term changes and effects?   </p>
","<p>The long-term impact of testosterone on women's health is still not clarified enough, so it's not easy to predict them exactly.
Some common <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3971358/"" rel=""noreferrer"">side-effects of high testosterone level</a> are acne and increased oiliness of the skin and hair. High level of testosterone con also lead to infertility and are commonly seen in polycystic ovarian syndrome.
There're side-effects related to high-dozage intake of testosterone: liver-damage, hirsutism, masculinization.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the 20 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examined the risk of liver disease in women receiving androgens and showed no change in hepatic enzymes. In the literature, this has been reported only in cases in which the blood testosterone levels increased to supraphysiological levels.</p>
  
  <p>Other adverse effects of the use of testosterone in women, such as hirsutism, deep voice, and an enlarged clitoris, should not be neglected. However, the most common adverse effects are acne and increased oiliness of the skin and hair, which were also reported in 3 of the studies shown in Table 1. In addition, 10% of patients receiving 1.25 mg/day or 2.5 mg/day of methyltestosterone and 45% of those receiving 10 mg/day of the same were reported to have experienced these side effects.</p>
  
  <p>Masculinization is rare and is due to the administration of high doses of androgens. Implants containing up to 300 µg/day of testosterone initially produce supraphysiological blood peaks, although these are transient and do not induce virilization.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel great about that feeling . So my question is does giving anesthesia to patients cause addiction .</p>
","<p>Addiction has both psychological and physical components.</p>

<p>Many sedatives, such as benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam or diazepam), do have a potential for both.  </p>

<p><strong>Physically</strong>, it takes more than one administration to create a chemical dependence, so that is not likely to have happened.  </p>

<p><strong>Physically</strong>, <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1413427-overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nitrous Oxide</a> is not known to create a chemical dependence - I cannot find that in the literature.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, <strong>psychologically</strong>, one of the things that many people with substance use disorders say is that they ""will do anything to achieve that feeling again."" They often think about the pleasure they feel when they are on the drug and have a powerful desire to feel it again.  This can be true for both of the above.</p>

<p>Nitrous Oxide IS actually used as a street drug where it's called ""Whip-Its"" and has harmful side effects.  Benzos and other sedatives are sold on the street as well, and also have serious side effects and potentially fatal withdrawal.</p>

<p>If you're worried whether you're physically addicted because they gave it to you once, no.</p>

<p>If you're just thinking ""that felt nice,"" that's not addiction either.</p>

<p>But if you're considering finding a way to achieve that feeling again (via Nitrous Oxide or another chemical), then you're starting the walk down the path to psychological addiction.  </p>

"Applying ice to tendinitis: how cold should it be?","85","","<p>One common way to treat a tendinitis is to apply <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tendinitis/expert-answers/tendinitis/faq-20057872"" rel=""nofollow"">ice</a>. How to judge whether the ice is not too cold, not too warm (so that it is effective)? If tendon-dependent, assume it is a tendinitis at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_compression_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">cold compression therapy</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studies have shown that the body activates the hunting response after only <strong>10 minutes of cryotherapy, at temperatures less than 49F (9.5C)</strong>. The hunting response is a cycle of vasoconstriction (decreased blood flow), then vasodilation (increased blood flow) that increases the delivery of oxygen and nutrient rich blood to the tissue. Increased blood flow can slow cell death, limit tissue damage and aid in the removal of cellular debris and waste products. Under normal circumstances the hunting response would be essential to tissue health but only serves to increase pain, inflammation and cell death as excess blood is forced into the area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but does not reference of the claim.</p>
","<p>Ice (cryotherapy) is a treatment for the inflammation which is secondary to the tendon injury its self. The inflammation is what usually causes the pain and can lead to additional compression injury of the surrounding tissue or chemical irritation of surrounding cells. With all of that said inflammation is a normal part of the healing process and should be controlled, not eliminated.</p>

<p>The way that ice treats inflammation is by numbing pain and constricting blood vessels to reduce the amount of fluid flow to the area thus decreasing the amount of swelling. There are risks to using ice as with any treatment. <a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007506.htm"">The risks being that of cold exposure such as frost bite, blisters, pain, etc...</a> </p>

<p>To avoid this risk is not usually a matter of temperature (<a href=""http://www.jospt.org/doi/pdf/10.2519/jospt.1983.5.2.66"">the goal often being a reduction of 10-15 degrees Celsius</a>) so much as duration of exposure. It is true that the duration will vary based on the temperature, but when using ice in a clinical setting the temperature is usually 0 degrees because the ice is melting. To further reduce that risk it is often recommended that ice directly from a freezer never be placed directly on the skin, but should be wrapped because it could be colder than 0 degrees.</p>

<p>The general rule for cryotherapy is to apply ice until the area is numb or 20 minutes, which ever comes first. There is no definitive research out there regarding cryotherapy, and there are many <a href=""http://www.nycc.edu/webdocs/ic/IQA/IQAFiles/Protocols/Chapter4/Cryotherapy4_1.pdf"">different modalities</a> and techniques used clinically.

"Can eye drops cure dry eyes?","85","","<p>When waking up on every morning it takes several minutes before I can clearly see (I have to blink quite a lot). During the day it's common to feel irritation, like I had soap on my eye. I've tried over dozen eye drop brands suggested by professionals, none having <em>any</em> discernible effect, bringing only temporary relief. I currently think I shouldn't spend money at all on eye drops. </p>
","<p>Most over the counter eye drops only provide temporary relief for dry eyes by actually adding liquid to the eye. Once the liquid added evaporates, gets absorbed, or is removed in one way or another your eyes will feel dry again unless your eyes are able to adequately lubricate themselves. So most eye drops aren't treating any underlying cause, just the temporary symptoms of dry eye. If this is a frequent problem I'd look to see if any other medications you're taking could be causing the dry eyes as a side effect. If you're not taking any other medications that could be causing this, seeing an optometrist or ophthalmologist sounds like a good idea.</p>

<p>Edit: I should also mention, there is a medication approved for chronic dry eye called Restasis. It is prescription only however.</p>

"How does sensitivity on teeth heal?","85","","<p>When teeth become sensitive I suppose it's because of enamel wearing away. Isn't this permanent? If so, then how come sensitive teeth eventually 'heal'?</p>
","<p>What Causes Sensitive Teeth? - <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/tooth-sensitivity"" rel=""nofollow"">WebmD</a></p>

<p>Things that cause this usually break down your teeth so that other things reach your pulp or tooth root which cause pain when touched. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dental cleaning</p></li>
<li><p>Tooth Grinding </p></li>
<li><p>Tooth Decay </p></li>
<li><p>Age </p></li>
<li><p>Tooth whitening products, etc</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So it is wear, as explained here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get it when your gums pull back and expose the surface beneath,
  called the dentin. This soft layer has thousands of tiny tubes that
  lead to the tooth's nerve center (the pulp). They allow the hot, cold,
  or sweet food to reach the nerve in your tooth, which kicks off your
  pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the above is just one scenario of how it can happen, the way your nerve reacts is not specific to that. Tooth sensitivity can be stopped by <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sensitive-teeth/faq-20057854"" rel=""nofollow"">several methods</a> depending on circumstance. Flouride can be used to help build the enamel of the tooth back, root canals can be used to eliminate problems in your root canal and are one of the most successful treatments for this. Also, there are grafts which cover the exposed root canal desensitizing root canal by applying resins. Using desensitizing toothpastes also help and preventing further wear of enamel is always on the treatment plan. The reason why sensitive teeth can get better is because the root canal is exposed and recovering enamel or desensitizing the nerve fixes the problem or makes it less sensitive to pain.
While in this answer I may have used different terminology the word pulp, root canal and root are referring to the nerve in your teeth.</p>

"How much Vitamin D does the body produce if you are outdoors a whole summer day?","85","","<p>How much Vitamin D does a person who's out the whole day in the summer and who's tanned enough that they don't get sunburn produce in a way that's bioavailable (measured in IU)?</p>

<p>To get a more specific scenario, let's take the average Summer day in Berlin where an average sized male wears pants but nothing about the waistline. The amount of tan is the amount that the average inhabitant of Berlin develops if he's out constantly over the summer in the same outfit. </p>

<p>I'm also happy about other specific examples. </p>
","<p>Vitamin D is produced in the skin by UV irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. But vitamin D in the skin is also broken down by UV irradiation and this leads to a maximum equilibrium level of vitamin D in the skin of the order of 25,000 IU (different sources will give different figures of this maximum value, <a href=""https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/how-do-i-get-the-vitamin-d-my-body-needs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The vitamin D council says it's between 10,000 and 25,000 IU</a>).</p>

<p>But this does not mean that you can get 25,000 IU per day from the Sun, because it takes a few days for the vitamin D in your skin to be transported to the liver where it gets converted to calcidiol. The maximum daily dose of vitamin D you can get from the Sun is estimated to be about 10,000 IU/day, <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/69/5/842.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see e.g. here</a>. So, if you expose your body to UV radiation from the Sun for the first time since last summer, then you can produce 25,000 IU in your skin, but by the next day only 10,000 IU will has been taken away from there, this means that with 15,000 IU still left in the skin you can only add 10,000 IU until you're back at the maximum of 25,000 IU.</p>

<p>This also means that to get a high dose of vitamin D, you don't need to expose your skin to the Sun every day. If we pretend that lower amounts of vitamin D in the skin don't affect the speed at which it is removed, then the body would be able to extract 20,000 IU in two days from the 25,000 IU, the amount of vitamin D left under your skin is then 5000 IU, exposing your skin to the Sun will add back that 20,000 IU. In reality, with lower amounts of vitamin D in the skin you'll extract less from it per unit time, so you won't get 10,000 IU/day if you go into the Sun every other day, but it's not going to be a factor of two lower as one could naively expect. </p>

"Standing up while deeply inhaling can cause a blood pressure fall?","84","","<p>Someone told me a few months ago of a technique to stop hiccups. When I followed the simple instructions given to me at that time it was extremely effective.</p>

<p>Recently, I <strong>tried</strong> to reproduce the technique:</p>

<ol>
<li>breathed in while squatting down, placing the knees against the chest;</li>
<li>slowly breathed out while standing up with the arms stretched forward;</li>
<li>hold the breath for about one minute.</li>
</ol>

<p>The hiccups didn't stop this time, so I thought I must have mistaken the breathing order. Therefore I tried reversing:</p>

<ol>
<li>breathed out while squatting down;</li>
<li>slowly breathed in (until full lung capacity) while standing up;</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I stood up, I immediately felt symptoms described in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Orthostatic hypotension</a> (found this page through a comment to <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1380/about-to-faint-when-standing-up"">another question similar to mine</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>dimmed vision with flashes and momentary blindness;</li>
<li>generalized numbness/tingling and fainting;</li>
<li>headache.</li>
</ul>

<p>I squatted down again after approximately 3-5 seconds and the symptoms subsided (with the exception of the headache, which lingered for a while), and I still had the hiccups.</p>

<p>I gave up on the technique and later managed to stop the hiccups while having some yogurt in my mouth and drink it with the head down (close to my knees).</p>

<p>I'm assuming that in the second sequence the blood flows rapidly to the legs and at the same time to the diaphragm to help filling the lungs, causing a blood pressure fall, and the head, in this case, is primarily affected. I'd like to confirm if this makes any sense.</p>
","<p>There seem to be a couple different issues under discussion. I will attempt to explain the relevant physiology and respond to the query in the title.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hiccup interruption</strong>. Most physical techniques involve stimulating efferent vagal tone. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25055206"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">These are effective.</a><sup>1</sup>  Commonly used methods (similar to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7416025"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">those used to abort supraventricular tachycardia</a>) include:    </p>

<ul>
<li>cold stimulation of the nasopharynx (upside down with ice water in the mouth will do it),  </li>
<li>carotid sinus massage, and</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Valsalva maneuver</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, a sudden <em>increase</em> in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">afterload</a> could also stimulate vagal tone via baroreceptors. When you describe squatting and breath-holding maneuvers, this is reminiscent of techniques that affect afterload and preload,<sup>2</sup> namely:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>squatting (vs. standing) increases both preload and afterload;  </p></li>
<li><p>deep inspiration increases preload to the R heart but decreases venous return to the L heart and thus systemic (including carotid sinus) pressure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, squatting and exhaling would be the combination that most effectively increases afterload and could theoretically trigger a vagal response. However, I’m not aware of any data suggesting that these are practically effective for termination of hiccups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orthostasis</strong>. You have outlined an effective method of temporarily depriving your brain of adequate blood flow and eliciting symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.<sup>3</sup> This is due to decreased preload to the L heart, most marked upon inspiration occurring simultaneous with standing from the squatting position. This tends to trigger the <em>sympathetic</em> nervous system rather than the <em>parasympathetic</em>. It is the latter that is associated with vagal tone helpful for terminating hiccups.   </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In summary</strong>:
Yes, standing up while inhaling will cause systemic blood pressure to fall with resulting decreased cerebral perfusion. This is generally unpleasant and does not come highly recommended. This is unlikely to be effective for hiccups.</p>

"Mechanical cardio resuscitation for asystole","83","","<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/q/5874/843"">We have great machines for shocking a heart out of various malfunctions</a>.</p>

<p>But my understanding is that the only ""machine"" indicated for restarting a heart that has completely stopped (i.e., ""flat-lined"") is manual compression.  I.e., even if you're a patient in a Level 1 trauma center, if you flat-line then all the machines get pushed aside and one person is going to start pushing on your chest above your heart to try to get it started.  (And you might get a does of epinephrine.  Oh, and if you're really ""lucky"" and they have your chest torn open then they'll reach in and compress the heart directly.)  Is this accurate?</p>

<p>If so, isn't this weird?  Pushing on the heart through the rib cage to get it to spontaneously start seems like trying to rescue someone drowning by standing on the shore and poking them with a stick.</p>

<p>We can electrically stimulate every muscle to contract.  I understand that a functional heartbeat requires a <em>coordinated</em> series of contractions.  An electrocardiogram can <em>monitor</em> the sequence of contractions in a functional heartbeat.  Why can't it (or something like it) pump current back through its electrodes to <em>stimulate</em> a perfect heartbeat?</p>

<p>Or, if one could place arbitrary electrodes directly on a heart, could an electronic device force it to beat &ndash; indefinitely &ndash; when it has flat-lined?  Or is there some reason that is not technically or medically feasible?</p>

<p>Again, it just seems weird that when the heart stops the current best practice is basically to just try ""nudging"" it to start.</p>
","<p>""Giving"" electrical current to the heart does not necessarily translate to mechanical contractions.
The excitation-contraction coupling(as the sequence of electrical activation an muscle contraction is officially called) , is not always a guarantee.</p>

<p>A cardiac arrest in many cases mirrors severe malfunction on the level of the micro-structures of the heart and a biochemical disarray in general. If you don't restore the pumping of the heart in seconds to minutes(even if this is crude and primitive-looking), the patient may not only die, but even worse they may ""live"" with severely depressed or completely absent brain function.</p>

<p>The only way, a ""modern"" way  would help a ""stopped"" heart is if some futuristic nano-device could be employed rapidly to either correct micro anatomy and microphysiology in minutes, or replace and collaborate with the patient's native structures.</p>

<p>However , primitive it may seem to you , external manual compressions, if properly performed can make the difference (at a great percentage) between life and death.</p>

<p>The ""electrical current- modern"" approach works for patients with severe arrhythmias or conduction problems. In these cases the ""mechanical part"" of the heart is intact and you only replace the electrical function of a problematic conduction system or problematic natural pacemakers.</p>

<p>Even in this case, a properly performed placement of a temporary pacemaker is an awkward process that can take several minutes until successful(transcutaneous or transvenous)placement is established. If the patient is asystolic or almost asystolic(no-pulse) , ""primitive "" compressions should be done until the pacemaker safely paces.</p>

<p>Unless a super enhanced swarm of nano-machines, that can navigate safely through the human body and correct problems rapidly and at will, emerges ,no ""sophisticated machines"" will replace manual compressions. In fact, during resuscitation they have been proven much more valuable than artificial breathing, which is reflected in the change in the guidelines during the past 15 years.</p>

<li>Exactly you’ve already outlined above. as this is an actually
difference in length some type of external intervention is required.</li>
<li>Unfortunately when dealing with a True LLD anytime the brace,
orthotic etc. is removed the underlying kinematic imbalance will
reappear.</li>
<li>Not surprisingly you’ll see frontal plane devations toward the
affected (shorter) side - such as a lateral pelvic tilt, scoliosis etc..</li>
</ul>

due to improper positioning -- they are never structural.</li>
<li>There’s a whole battery of orthopedic tests used to narrow down the
cause and type of LLD, I will not be going into this in any depth.

<h2>Musculature Details</h2>

<p><strong>Iliopsoas</strong>
  -  Unilateral - when the pelvis and femur are fixed the iliopsoas will
produce ipsilateral FB of the lumbar spine with contralateral RO.
The FB of the spine relative to the pelvis will decrease lumbar lordosis
Bilateral contraction of iliopsoas produces ant pelvic rotation and takes the sacrum along </p>

<p><strong>Rectus Femoris</strong>
 - when pelvis is fixed,  flexes the thigh on the pelvis
 - thigh and lumbar spine are fixed – and pelvis is free to move – it can cause ant innominate torsion ipsilaterally </p>

<p><strong>Hip Abductors / Adductors</strong>
 - Directly influence SI jt thru the pubic symphysis - since the gluteus medius tends to pull the ilium away from the sacrum- almost a distraction effect
 - Create stress through public symphyisis 
 - Adductors- create stress thru pubic symphysis
 - Abductors sartorius may have an anterior torsion effect on the innominate when the hip is extended and the knee is slightly flexed abductor </p>

<p><strong>Piriformis:</strong> 
-Bilateral contraction of the piriformis produces a nutation effect on the sacrum 
– Unilaterally get a rotational effect toward contralateral side</p>

<p><strong>Gluteus Maximus:</strong> Bilateral contraction of the maximus- post pelvic rotation – unilateral contraction – causes ipsilateral post torsion </p>

<p><strong>Hamstrings:</strong> Tightness can cause post innominate torsion</p>

<p><strong>Transversus Abdominis:</strong>  Contributes to the stiffness of the SI jt</p>

<p><strong>Quadratus Femoris</strong> - bilaterally contraction-stabilizes the lumbar spine and can result in sacral nutation</p>

<p><strong>Multifidus</strong> – it is considered an anticipatory stabilizer of the LS spine 
the multifidi are recruited as a stabilizer before the Lower and Upper limbs  move 
Co contraction of multifidus and the TrA – further increase stiffness of the SI jt.  Ipsilateral side bending will increase the shearing stress to the ipsilateral SI jt </p>

<p>In order for an aneurysm to occur, conditions must be present that cause <strong>degradation</strong> or <strong>abnormal development</strong> of the structural components of the blood vessel wall.</p>

<p>We can list out common causes into those two categories:</p>

<h3>Degradation/Degenerative factors</h3>

<p>The usual suspects.</p>

<p>These factors all contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and biomechanical wall stress in blood vessels like the aorta. This damage to the structural integrity of the aortic wall can lead to an aneurysm.</p>

"When should I drink from the sea?","83","","<p>Just out of curiosity, consider the following situation. I'm going to die out of thirst and there is no source of water, but sea water.</p>

<p><strong><em>Should I drink it</em></strong>? <strong>OR</strong> <strong><em>it will just make things worse</em></strong> and make me more dehydrated? </p>

<p>In other words, at which point should I consider drinking, <strong><em>maybe just a small sip?</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Please reply according to scientific facts or true experience.</em></p>
","<p>In the attempt to prevent or treat dehydration you should not drink sea water.</p>

<p>In short: By drinking seawater you ingest excessive amount of sodium chloride, which needs to be excreted by urine in order to maintain normal blood sodium concentration. Since the human kidneys have a limited ability to concentrate urine, the amount of water lost by urine in order to excrete sodium chloride is greater than the amount of water in the drunk seawater. This results in a net water loss. </p>

<p>Detailed explanation is below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=krLSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=kidney%20urine%20concentration%20ability%20seawater&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZBnVktECYW&amp;sig=yJ7xaF3POeo_UjRyTnoATKszmy8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=kidney%20urine%20concentration%20ability%20seawater&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">E. Hall, Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 13th edition, 2016 (p. 373) </a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The limited ability of the human kidney to concentrate the urine to
  only 1,200 mOsm/L explains why severe dehydration occurs if one
  attempts to drink seawater.</p>
  
  <p>Sodium chloride concentration in the oceans averages about 3-3.5% with
  an osmolality between about 1,000 and 1,200 mOsm/L.</p>
  
  <p>Drinking 1 liter of seawater...would provide a total sodium chloride
  intake of 1,200 mOsm. If maximal urine concentration ability is 1,200
  mOsm/L, the amount of urine needed to excrete 1,200 mOsm would be...1
  liter.</p>
  
  <p>The kidneys must also excrete other solutes, especially urea, which
  contribute about 600 mOsm/L when urine is maximally concentrated.
  Therefore the maximal concentration of sodium chloride that can be
  excreted by the kidneys is about 600 mOsm/L. Thus for every liter of
  seawater drunk, 1.5 liters of urine volume would be required to rid
  the body of 1,200 mOsm of sodium chloride ingested in addition to 600
  mOsm of other solutes...This would result in a <strong>net fluid loss of 0.5
  liter for every liter of seawater drunk.</strong></p>

"Can optic neuritis be recovered 100%?","81","","<p>I had inflammation in the optic nerve. There was deficiency in my field of vision. That's because of multiple sclerosis (ms).

</ul></li>
</ol>
","<p>There's no reason to expect a full recovery within a short period of time. Optic neuritis takes some time to heal - if it does - and usually leads to effects lasting for months or longer. Many studies have found that vision will eventually return to average levels:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12493277"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hickman et al. (2002)</a>:</strong> ~85% of patients eventually reached levels of 20/25 or better in the affected eye, with improvements beginning to show within several weeks.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that these results are for acute demyelinating optic neuritis; I don't know if that was what you had. Additionally, this is data from the primary episode. The ONTT found that 35% of patients suffered a recurrence within 10 years. Further episodes could lead to longer (or incomplete) recoveries.</p>

<p>Again, though, don't expect the symptoms to go away quickly, especially if you have multiple sclerosis. While certain factors can lead to a quicker recovery, especially in children, this is seldom the case. Finally, consult your doctor before doing the exercises you list.

Many of the studies focused on different medications/dosages and assessed performance in different ways. There's no easy way to assess total mental ""improvement"" with these medications; you have to have certain tasks that you can quantify. So while these medications may help in some areas (reaction time, logical reasoning, attention based tasks) they might not provide any benefit in others (critical thinking, articulating thoughts, imagination). </p>

"Fainted history in both myself and my father. Can it be related?","81","","<p>I am a twenty five year old male, pretty fit, no known conditions. I fainted last night for a few seconds and although I will get it checked out, it has to wait for a week or two so I thought I'd get an opinion here. </p>

<p>A very similar incident also happened a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>In both cases, I was sitting on the floor/lying down for twenty or more minutes. I got up and within about ten seconds, I felt dizzy and lost consciousness and fell down. I regained it within ten seconds and was completely okay. I remembered everything upto the feeling dizzy part. </p>

<p>The thing that worries me is that my dad has also had fainting spells of about one every year for the last three years (although not due to standing up suddenly). I'm not sure what his diagnosis is. </p>

<p>Given a fainting history on standing in a young, otherwise healthy male, and a fainting history in his father, can the two be related? What might be the causes?</p>
","<p>There is, unfortunately, no yes or no answer to this, especially not on-line. However, these information can help:</p>

<p>There can be various underlying causes of fainting, mostly cardiovascular or neurological. It is important to note that same pathophysiological mechanisms may be a part of different clinical syndromes. Some of these (classification adjusted for laypersons) include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>vasovagal syncope (neurocardiogenic syncope)</p></li>
<li><p>orthostatic syncope (usually caused by orthostatic hypotension) - this is a subset of syncope caused by peripheral circulatory impairment</p></li>
<li><p>various cardiac problems</p></li>
<li><p>hypoglycaemia</p></li>
<li><p>hypoxia</p></li>
<li><p>reflexive anoxic seizures (RAS)</p></li>
<li><p>loss of consciousness can be caused by an epileptic seizure or even a stroke, and should be distinguished from a syncope.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>The fact that you faint after standing up is certainly one component of it, but as <a href=""http://tulane.edu/som/departments/neurology/programs/clerkship/upload/wch8.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> suggests, even that can be classified under different clinical syndromes (peripheral circulatory impairment or neurocardiogenic syncope, e.g.). This is why it is best practice to have this condition checked by a physician. Diagnosis cannot be made on-line.</p>

<p>To answer your other question, whether the condition is hereditary, it may, but doesn't have to be. The only way to determine this is to find the cause of fainting in both cases, that is in your and in your father's case.</p>

<p>On a general note, conditions caused by genetic disorders (i.e. mutations) may be monogenic (mutation is found on a single gene) and polygenic (mutations are on several genes, and one has to inherit more than one, for a condition to manifest). Than, there is a matter of a pattern in which the condition is passed on - whether the condition is dominant or recessive (i.e. whether the condition will manifest itself if you have the gene for it from one parent, or only if you inherited a certain mutation from both parents). In the end, there are multy-factorial conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Very few health conditions are only caused by genes – most are caused by the combination of genes and environmental factors.</em> (from NHS).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The claim <em>very few</em> is, as anongoodnurse noticed, proportional to overall number of diseases, but there are still a lot of conditions that are genetic.</p>

<p>So the matter of whether the conditions in a parent and child are connected isn't always straight-forward, but the place to start is definitely to determine the aetiology  in both cases, which can be done by a physician (in person).</p>

"How is myocarditis diagnosed?","81","","<p>How is inflammation of the hearth muscle (myocarditis) diagnosed? What are typical symptoms? What is it commonly mixed up with? How do you differentiate reliably?</p>
","<p>Diagnosis of myocarditis</p>

<p>To diagnose myocarditis, your doctor may conduct a physical examination, and discuss your medical history and any signs or symptoms you may have. If your doctor suspects myocarditis, he or she might order one or more tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of your condition, including:</p>

<p>MRI. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show your heart's size, shape and structure. This test can show signs of inflammation of the heart muscle and help make or confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis.</p>

<p>Echocardiogram. Sound waves, or ultrasound, can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram might detect enlargement of your heart, poor pumping function, valve problems or fluid around your heart.</p>

<p>Cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. In this test, a small tube (catheter) is inserted into a vein in your leg or neck and then is threaded into your heart. In some cases, doctors use a special instrument to remove a tiny sample of heart muscle tissue (biopsy) for analysis in the lab to see if there are signs of inflammation or infection.</p>

<p>Symptoms of myocarditis</p>

<p>The most common symptom of myocarditis is shortness of breath during exercise or exertion.</p>

<p>Other symptoms may include fatigue, heart palpitations and chest pain or pressure. The legs also may swell. Rarely, myocarditis causes a sudden loss of consciousness that may be due to abnormal heart rhythms. In summary, patients may experience some, all or none of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat, sudden loss of consciousness.</p>

<p>Can myocarditis be confused with other heart diseases?</p>

<p>Yes. For example, the symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath, fatigue, inability to tolerate exercise, and associated with difficulty breathing while laying down/sleeping are common to many heart diseases besides myocarditis.  One feature that distinguishes myocarditis from other causes of heart failure is that it often follows an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection and is due to a specific immune response against the heart itself.</p>

In the days before head CT scanning was widely available, the only way to know if someone had life-threatening brain bleeding (which occurs in less than 0.1 percent of those with concussion) was to observe him for a decrease in his level of alertness that resulted from the blood pressing on vital brain structures. This usually happened within six hours of injury. It was thought that if you could keep someone awake you could prevent him from lapsing into coma, which of course did not work.</p>

<p><strong>While <a href=""http://15answers.com/does-keeping-someone-awake-keep-them-from-dying-like-in-movies/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some people on the internet</a> claim</strong> that someone awake with a higher blood pressure and a faster pulse will have better survival chances, (actually, this would mean that they bleed more, not less), there is no scientific evidence that this will indeed improve survival chances.</p>

"Am I overweight? Bad self image...?","80","","<p>Alright, I'm a fourteen-year-old male freshmen in high-school. I weigh 120 pounds, and I am around 5'5 - 5'6. Am I overweight? </p>

<p>I am on the cross-country team, so I run thirty-five miles a week (usually around six miles a day), and I try to eat well. Am I considered overweight for my age? I am currently trying to diet by only eating a few protein bars for breakfast and lunch, but I do slip at times and eat desert. I also love carbs. Any advice?</p>
","<p>No, you are <strong>not</strong> overweight at all, and whoever told you it was a good idea to even consider a ""diet"" was very mistaken. Don't listen to them.</p>

<p>At 120 pounds and 5'5"", your <a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Body Mass Index</a> is 20.0, which is about the middle of the normal range -- an excellent place to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>BMI Categories:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Underweight = &lt;18.5</p>
  
  <p>Normal weight = 18.5–24.9</p>
  
  <p>Overweight = 25–29.9</p>
  
  <p>Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you're running 35 miles a week tells me you're in no danger of slipping into being overweight anytime soon. And of course you love carbs! Everyone loves carbs, but you can afford to enjoy them, so don't worry about it as long as you stay away from soft drinks and crap fast food.</p>

<p>In fact, as an athlete, you need carbs. Running 6 miles a day requires a significant amount of energy, and carbs are generally the best way of supplying that before and during your runs. Carbs before/during and protein after is usually the best approach. The carbs supply immediate energy for the run, and the protein after supplies the materials your body needs to build muscle.</p>

"Bitten by a Hobo Spider. How serious? Going to off-hour clinic tomorrow, but should I go to the ER now?","80","","<p>Sometime last night I was bitten by what appeared to be a Hobo spider! I live in Vancouver, British Columbia (Pacific Northwest). At first, the bite didn't hurt too much, but hours later, the punctured site get swollen and redder and redder, and the pain began to increase. Soon a blister formed around it. </p>

<p>Now the redness has radiated and a line stems from it continuing down my body. The blister has since burst and there is a scaley brown ulcer that has emerged. The redness are also dry and flaky and hot to the touch. Also, the pain feels deeper? The bite is on my chest, and it hurts when I breathe. </p>

<p>It's the weekend so the doctor offices are closed, but I'm determined to go to the off-hour clinic tomorrow morning. However, should I be more concerned and go to the ER now? I'm not sure whether I'm under reacting or over-reacting. </p>
","<p>So I didn't die during the night, but the pain did awake me with a jolt at about 5am, and I went to the Urgent Care Clinic promptly at 6am, and it's a good thing because the inflamed site had grown significantly. The Doctors were able to incise/cut out the bite site and take a syringe and suck out the venom/blister/pus that was festering underneath. They applied antibiotic cream over that and bandaged it up. They swabbed it and are running a culture test on it to know which medications are best to treat this. They think they got all of it, but want to make sure it didn't enter my bloodstream, etc. </p>

<p>Apparently during the fall, the Hobo Spiders are extremely aggressive/active at night as it is their mating season and while their bite is not always venomous (it depends whether they inject it at the time), sometimes it is, and in this case it was. The symptoms of a Hobo Spider bite are akin to a Brown Recluse, although not as a potent. But the wound site does take several months to recover/heal completely and will probably leave a scar. </p>

<p>If the bite is venomous or it just becomes infected, it can become pretty serious, especially for those with poor immune systems. </p>

<p>So just be aware of the Hobo Spider if you are in the Pacific Northwest!  Or if you are concerned about any spider bite, just speak to your physician -- don't hesitate. </p>

"Off-label prescribing of drugs","80","","<p>Is off-label prescribing completely prohibited? Can a drug be prescribed by doctors for a disease or condition for which FDA has not approved it and hence this condition is not listed on the label? It is presumed that this disease or condition is not explicitly listed as a contra-indication, i.e. when the drug is clearly stated to be avoided since it may be harmful.</p>
","<p>Off-label prescribing of medicines - that is, prescribing medicines for indications, age groups or other circumstances for which they are not approved, is not prohibited by the FDA. FDA regulates approval of medicines for marketing, but it does not regulate the practice of medicine. Hence, once the medicine is on the market for certain indications it is up to physicians how they will describe them. (1,2).</p>

<p>However, this is not an unregulated field. The FDA does state that <strong>off-label use must be distinguished from clinical trials</strong> - which means when physicians prescribe medicines under off-label circumstances they are not experimenting on their patients. Furthermore, FDA stresses that <strong>this practice must benefit the patient and be in line with Good medical practice</strong>. In their own words (3):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Good medical practice and the best interests of the patient require that physicians use legally available drugs, biologics and devices according to their best knowledge and judgement. If physicians use a product for an indication not in the approved labeling, they have the responsibility to be well informed about the product, to base its use on firm scientific rationale and on sound medical evidence, and to maintain records of the product's use and effects. Use of a marketed product in this manner when the intent is the ""practice of medicine"" does not require the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) or review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). However, the institution at which the product will be used may, under its own authority, require IRB review or other institutional oversight.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though such practice isn't prohibited and is in fact sometimes necessary (1, 4), it still opens physicians to potential liability. Legal complaints are usually phrased as medical malpractice due to negligence or due to lack of an informed consent, which is recommended, but not mandatory (1, 2). </p>

<p>What physicians can do to protect themselves from liability is take care that their off label prescribing is (2):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>made with the 
  patient’s knowledge that a drug is being 
  prescribed for an off-label use; </p></li>
  <li><p>principally motivated by a desire to diagnose, 
  treat and directly benefit the patient for whom a drug is prescribed; </p></li>
  <li><p>based on the doctor’s own expert medical opinion; </p></li>
  <li><p>supported by reputable peer reviewed literature reflecting sound scientific evidence; </p></li>
  <li><p>generally supported by the opinions of the physician’s local colleagues</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The situation is, however, different with the industry - promotion of off label use of medicines is prohibited. FDA has issued a draft document on it's viewpoint on industry providing information about off label use of their medicines. The request for information must be unsolicited (i.e. the company or its permanent or temporary employees should not prompt these requirements), and whether the request is public or not, the information should be provided in one-on-one communication (5). Furthermore, this document states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>FDA has long taken the position that firms can respond to unsolicited requests for information about FDA-regulated medical products by providing truthful, balanced, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific or medical information that is responsive to the specific request, even if responding to the request requires a firm to provide information on unapproved or uncleared indications or conditions of use.</em></p>

<p>But as I walked home, I kept thinking about that folder because it seemed so bizarre to me. Was this a thing that happens a lot that necessitated a guidebook? </p>

<p>I had never considered <strong>what would happen if you were strapped into the MRI during the wake of an earthquake? Was there actually an official safety protocol for this?</strong> Except... try to wriggle your way out and go somewhere safe? </p>
","<p>I never performed MRI scan in the past but I had experience of several quite big earthquakes within the last 10 years. So I provide my thought on this for your reference.</p>

<p>I have to say that you probably already in the safest place during an earth quake in a building for two reasons: </p>

<p>1) rooms for big scanners are usually build with solid concrete and very likely to be strengthened further comparing with standard concrete building for accomodation or office. That makes the room very unlikely to collapse during an earth quake. </p>

<p>2) MRI machine is basically a giant piece of metal. If earth quake strikes during your scan, you have already surrounded and protected by this heavy and strong metal structure. This makes your situation even safer as you will be well protected even the building collapse. </p>

<p>Based on my personal experience on earth quakes, I think you will be pretty safe even there is a magnitude 8 or less earth quake happen during your MRI scan. For the quakes that more than magnitude 8, shallow and close by, well, good luck.</p>

<p>After some time, my back usually starts to feel weird and I have the urge of stretching my lower back. <strong>@Omu</strong> explained the symptom very well in a comment. This also occurs for me when walking for a very long time.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Appendices</h2>

","<h1>How can I deal with standing for long periods?</h1>

<h2>I have an odd sensation, like pins and needles</h2>

<p>The technical name for that kind of altered sensation is <a href=""http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/numbness-and-tingling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paraesthesia</a>. It can have a <a href=""http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/1077/diagnosis/step-by-step.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">number of causes</a>; so much so that if you are getting this and it's bothering you the usual response applies: <em>go and seek medical advice</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you are still a bit reticent and want to try other things first, there are a number of options.</p>

<h2>Stand right!</h2>

<p>Postural problems <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3629399"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can cause nerve compression</a>. An <em>anterior pelvic tilt</em> is relatively common:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XCwad.png"" height=""300""></p>

<p><em>(credit: <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PostureFoundationGarments04fig1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anonymous - Posture &amp; Foundation Garments</a>, public domain)</em></p>

<p><em>Posterior</em> pelvic tilt can happen too:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tS8AZ.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tS8AZ.gif"" alt=""posterior tilt""></a></p>

<p><em>(credit: <a href=""https://spscgym.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/anterior-pelvic-tilt-lets-talk-about-your-curvy-low-back-and-forward-tipped-pelvis/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SPSC Crossfit</a>)</em></p>

<p>So if you are standing for long periods, make sure your posture is good:</p>

<ul>
<li>head level (not forward)</li>
<li>chin parallel to ground</li>
<li>chest high</li>
<li>shoulders level and relaxed</li>
<li>abdomen flat, held up and in</li>
<li>lower back flat and tucked under</li>
<li>legs straight, knees relaxed</li>
<li>feet parallel, toes forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check your footwear</h2>

<p>Related to the above, differences in footwear <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.386/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">may affect posture</a> (NB, small <em>n</em>). Interestingly, high-heels <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1910649"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">may not be as bad as many think</a> in this area.</p>

<p>The main point is to wear relatively 'neutral' footwear where possible; and support/take account of high/fallen arches if appropriate.</p>

<h2>Take Breaks / Exercise</h2>

<p>If you are able to take a break to sit down for a while, or at least move in a way that is different to how you stand, this movement can grant some relief.</p>

<p>Squats (supported by a wall if needed), simple weight transfers - either leg-to-leg, or forefoot-to-hindfood - and pelvic tilting exercises can assist.</p>

<p>This may be a point to ask a physiotherapist for advice (as below), as it is easier for someone else to observe your posture and where the sensation is; then make recommendations based on that!</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<h3>Ask for Help</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't want to bother my doctor with issues of no concern</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a general point: if something is causing you issues, then it is of concern. You don't have to have to be terribly unwell to see a doctor! I understand where you are coming from, but if you are suffering as a result of something it may be worth running it past them.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could <strong>consult a physiotherapist</strong> for their opinion and suggestions for exercise. Here, it is possible to self-refer to physios (although there was a significant wait last time I used that service); but there are usually reasonably-priced private options too.</p>

<h3>Use a Foam Roller</h3>

<p>Since you asked for suggestions backed by personal experience and not just the usual sources, I would be remiss in not putting this forward. Anecdotally (<em>n=3</em>), using a foam roller has helped and given relief for back stiffness (with its attendant altered sensation) and pain. The <em>n</em>s in this case are myself, my father, and a close family friend.</p>

<p>They are fairly simple things in and of themselves:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5EBde.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5EBde.jpg"" alt=""foam roller""></a>
<em>(credit: self)</em></p>

<p>and decent relief can be achieved by lying perpendicularly on top of them positioned near your power back, and rolling back and forth. More info can be found elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is highly anecdotal and I haven't yet found good sources to back them up- but lots of (trendy) health mags like them. That might be a positive or a negative thing, depending on your perspective.</p>

<h2>Further Disclaimer</h2>

<p>If you start having significant other issues, like numbness, issues with continence, severe pain, weight loss or other <a href=""http://www.gloshospitals.nhs.uk/en/Wards-and-Departments/Departments/Pain-Management/Different-Pains/Back-Pain-Draft/Red-Flags-in-Back-Pain/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">red flag symptoms</a>; <strong>definitely see a doctor</strong>!</p>

<p>Given the problem you are having, you probably already knew that. You probably also know some of the recommendations for back pain, but they are worth restating, in brief:</p>

<li>try <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Backpain/Pages/low-back-pain-exercises.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exercises geared towards back pain</a></li>
<li>anti-inflammatory painkillers may help; but if you have stomach issues or are going to be taking them longer-term the you definitely should have a conversation with your doctor about that</li>
<li>hot and cold compression packs can give relief</li>

"Max heart rate questions","79","","<p><strong>Max Heart Rate</strong>
How accurate really is the 220 -minus my age = max heart rate formula? I don't even come close no matter what I do. My max should be 187. Most blogs say I'm just not exercising hard enough. Today I tested this theory: Sprinted for 3 minutes. Then, slowed down to a brisk walk (139). Then did it again (145). Finally, I started at a good clip, nearly a sprint and kept it up for 8 minutes and ended with an all out sprint for about 50 yards (155). Is this cause for concern? Seems oddly low for someone who really isn't in the greatest shape right now.</p>
","<p>Currently, there is no definitive way to predict maximum heart rate for a single individual. There are formulae that can give an approximation, but about the only way to get a good estimate on a personal level is to do a maximal treadmill test with monitoring.</p>

<p>As far as the 220-age, that is a bad myth, and wasn't based on a study, but simple observation of 11 different references of both published and unpublished research. This <a href=""https://www.cyclingfusion.com/pdf/220-Age-Origins-Problems.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF writeup goes through the history</a> of the 220-age origins, and gives some alternate ways to calculate maxHR.

So instead, I ask a more general one as entitled above.</p>

<p>I am conjecturing that the body has methods to detect the excess of <em>Propionibacterium acnes</em> bacteria. If correct, then e.g., why cannot the body open skin pores to unclog oil?<br>
Surely the body can do something better than forming pimples and pus? </p>

<p>You can see that there is no muscle to control the size of the pore where the hair exits the skin, so there is no way that the body can control normally the size.</p>

<p>The primary problem is not with the Propionibacterium acnes but with <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/basics/causes/con-20020580"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">excessive oil production</a> which then causes a blockage in conjunction with dead skin creating a fertile environment for the bacteria to proliferate.</p>

<p>Commensal bacteria on the skin are not controlled by the immune system ( white cells, antibodies, complement etc can't migrate through intact skin to reach the bacteria ) but by competition with <a href=""http://www.dermnetnz.org/bacterial/microorganisms.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other bacteria</a>, moisture etc.</p>

<p>Oil or sebum production is driven by <a href=""http://www.dermnetnz.org/acne/sebum.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sex hormones testosterone, 5-testosterone (DHT) and 5-androstene-317diol</a>, and unless there's some evolutionary advantage to do so, there won't be any selection for those individuals who less likely to produce excessive oil.

"Best type of flu shot","78","","<p>This October I am going to new Doctor who is close to my home. Old Doctor passed away. </p>

<p>In general:</p>

<p>What type of vaccine would be good for healthy lady in mid-30s?</p>

<p>What type of vaccine would be good for elderly who are somewhat active, doing stuff around the house, but suffer the regular aches and pains, who are early 70s?</p>
","<p>The 2015 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not express a preference for use of any particular product over another for persons for whom more than one type of vaccine is appropriate and available.</p>

<p>The major recommendations concern age, state of health, allergies (some vaccines are specifically recommended for people allergic to eggs or to previous vaccines, pregnancy, etc.), fear of needles (there are multiple ways now to receive influenza vaccines including microneedle intradermal doses, intramuscular jet, and nasal, along with the routine IM injection), timing of the vaccine (especially in the elderly and young).</p>

<p><em>A previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, regardless of the component suspected of being responsible for the reaction, is a contraindication to future receipt of the vaccine.</em></p>

<p>Basically, if the vaccine (in the US) is FDA approved, it should be fine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What type of vaccine would be good for healthy lady in mid-30s[?]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that you're <strong>not pregnant</strong>, in the absence of data (recent studies including the 2014 flu season) demonstrating consistent greater relative effectiveness of the current quadrivalent formulation of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), preference for LAIV over Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) is no longer recommended. </p>

<p>In your age range and state of health, you should <em>avoid</em> the LAIV if</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>you've experienced severe allergic reactions to the vaccine or any of its components, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine</li>
  <li>you have a history of egg allergy</li>
  <li>you've taken influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours</li>
  <li>you care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you live with someone with bad asthma, you might want to consult your doctor about which vaccine is better for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What type of vaccine would be good for elderly who are somewhat active, doing stuff around the house, but suffer the regular aches and pains, who are early 70s?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, they should avoid the LAIV. In addition, they should consult their doctor if they have any medical conditions, and for information about the timing of the vaccine (the optimal timing for those over 65 varies from continent to continent and even country to country.) </p>

<p>Given all the above, I have only ever been asked, ""Are you allergic to eggs?"" before getting a flu shot!</p>

"Can someone explain these cancer names?","78","","<p>I am looking at the death certificate of a relative, and I do not understand these names.</p>

<pre><code>Colon Carcinoma
    due to or as a consequence of
Abdominal Carcinomatosis
    due to or as a consequence of
Liver &amp; Lung Metastatic Carcinoma
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The causal sequence indicated here doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Having signed many death certificates, I can sympathize with the doctor who signed off on it. Generally, these have to be typed up in <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/death11-03final-acc.pdf"">a form</a> (in my experience, on a typewriter....). Someone other than the doctor usually does that, which means there is some verbal communication between the doctor and an administrative person about what should go in the blanks and... it doesn’t always come out exactly perfectly. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/basics/definition/con-20031877"">Colon carcinoma</a> is generally used to indicate a <em>primary</em> tumor of the epithelial cells of the colon. That is, the cells lining the inside of the colon underwent a mutation of some sort that caused a cancerous growth. </p>

<p>Abdominal carcinomatosis is what happens when cancer cells fall off (basically) the tumor and “seed” the <a href=""https://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_5/chapter_26.html"">peritoneal space</a>, which is the area outside the gut but inside the abdomen. The cells land in various places and start growing more tumors. Often, this is accompanied by secretion of fluid which results in <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/170907-overview"">ascites</a>, and the cancer can also spread by falling into this fluid and landing elsewhere. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/what-is-cancer/metastatic-fact-sheet"">Metastatic carcinoma</a> (here to lung and liver) is what happens when the cancer cells get in the bloodstream or lymphatic system and spread to ‘distant’ organs. There they set up new tumors, but the cells can still be identified as having originated from the colon. </p>

<p>The causal sequence is then:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>colon carcinoma &#8594; abdominal carcinomatosis<br>
      colon carcinoma &#8594; metastatic carcinoma (sites: liver and lung)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally it would also be possible to state a more proximate factor that directly resulted in death. For cancer metastatic to lung, that might be ‘hypoxemic respiratory failure’ (lack of oxygen).</p>

"Pimples: Causes and Cures?","78","","<p>I am thirteen years old and have quite a few pimples. I have a couple of questions:</p>

<p><strong>1. What causes them?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. When I pop them(I try not too) they ooze out sticky fluid. What is it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. How can I stop them? Every morning and night, I rinse my face, then     wash my face(with soap) and rinse again, then scrub with sugar, then put on some medicine.</strong></p>
","<p>Simply put - skin cells, sebum and hair can clump together into a plug, this plug gets infected with bacteria, resulting in a swelling. A pimple starts to develop when the plug begins to break down.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia: 
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimples</a>
“A pimple is a result of a blockage of the skin's pore. 
 Inside the pore are sebaceous glands which produce sticky sebum. When the outer layers of skin shed (as it does continuously), the dead skin cells left behind may become 'glued' together by the sticky sebum. This causes a blockage in the pore. The sebaceous glands produce more sebum which builds up behind the blockage, and this sebum harbours bacteria (P.Acnes bacteria). Since the body's natural defence against bacteria is primarily phagocytes (white blood cells), these rush to the site behind the blockage (where the bacteria are). This is what gives some pimples the 'whiteheads' (unless the Phagocytes are deeper in the skin, which means you can't see the 'white' caused by them). The white blood cells then destroy (by phagocytosis) the bacteria to prevent infection.”</p>

<p>Over-the-counter medications</p>

<p>Common over-the-counter medications for pimples are benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid and antibacterial agents such as triclosan. Both medications can be found in many creams and gels used to treat acne (acne vulgaris) through topical application. Both medications help skin slough off more easily, which helps to remove bacteria faster. Before applying them the patient needs to wash his or her face with warm water and dry</p>

<p>Home-remedies</p>

<ol>
<li>Dab some lemon juice on it</li>
</ol>

<p>Lemon juice can help get rid of breakouts for a number of reasons. It is rich in vitamin C, which is good for all types of skin, and it’s a citric acid, so it helps ‘exfoliate’ the skin as well. Most importantly though, it is an astringent. An astringent will cause a contraction of body tissues, and will therefore dry out the blemish itself.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The land of milk and honey (or yogurt)</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason it is suggested that milk would cause acne is because of the extra hormones in it-but unless it’s ingested, this doesn’t really do much. For the most part, it just soothes the irritated skin, and helps tone down the redness.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Whip up some ‘whites</li>
</ol>

<p>Egg whites are an easy and affordable way to help reduce acne and fade scars left by unfortunate blemishes. The reason people have found egg whites to be helpful for their skin is because they’re chock full of proteins and vitamins that both combat acne, and help to rebuild your skin cells.</p>

<p>It is impossible - literally* - to test every batch of ice cream, spinach, frozen hamburger, etc. that is shipped out to supermarkets for sale.

If they do not, they are held responsible for damages inflicted on the public, as well as punitive damages and fines.</p>

<p>In the example of ice cream, the FDA has guidelines for the facilities that produce the product based on years of studies and experience. They include cleaning recommendations, temperatures at certain stages, the amount of time the product must spend at certain temperatures, etc. The facilities are inspected routinely, and when a product ends up contaminated, the FDA does a new inspection and reviews the previous inspections for evidence that previous recommendations were ignored, or might have prevented what occurred.

  <p><strong>Why are inflammations painful in the case of a tendinitis?</strong></p>
  
  <p>When suffering from tendinitis, does the inflammation itself cause any
  pain, and if so why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the <a href=""http://patient.info/health/tendonitis-and-tenosynovitis"" rel=""nofollow"">definition of tendinitis</a> actually meaning <strong>inflammation of a tendon</strong>, what's typically associated with this condition, and the body's immune system response with it stimulating nerve cells and triggering pain, <strong>inflammation can and does cause pain</strong>.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tendinitis/basics/definition/con-20020309"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Definition <sub>(1)</sub></strong></a></p>
  
  <p>Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon — any one of the
  thick fibrous cords that attaches muscle to bone. The condition causes
  pain and tenderness just outside a joint. <sub>(1)</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When swelling occurs and the immune system responds accordingly, this process can also stimulate nerves and trigger the pain effect so based on this, that is WHY inflammation causes pain with tendinitis or any other condition for this matter with the human body.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>WebMD - Inflammation <sub>(2)</sub></strong></a></p>
  
  <p>When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells
  are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body
  from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood
  flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and
  warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues,
  resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves
  and cause pain. <sub>(2)</sub></p>

"Anxiety and panic attack relieves","76","","<p>What are the best advices on how to get rid of anxiety and panic attacks? 
It seems like there are so many advices out there that is hard to know which ones are good and which ones are bad. Any suggestions or personal opinions that anyone wants to share?</p>
","<p>I have suffered from health anxiety for the last couple of years and let me share some of the things I find helpful.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong>: Drinking loads of water instantly relieves the tightness in your throat and definitely helps alleviate anxiety. If you think you're about to have a panic attack start drinking till your stomach is full and think about the movement of water inside you. This will help you alleviate some of the anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Take Deep Breaths</strong>: When you get anxious, flight and fight hormones are released into your bloodstream that causes muscle tightness and increased metabolism, elevated heartbeat rate etc. You must start taking deep controlled breaths as soon as you feel anxious. Also by counting backwards from 10 to 1 as you breathe it will help your mind achieve relaxation more quickly</li>
<li><strong>Hypnosis &amp; Meditation</strong>: This is the long term solution to attack the anxiety itself. There are youtubers like Michael Sealey and Jason Stephenson who have wonderful meditation/hypnosis video guides that will help you learn how to control your anxiety and have a more positive outlook. Don't try to meditate when you're having a panic attack as this may irritate you further. Make it a routine to meditate on a daily basis for at least 40-50 mins. While it may not cure your anxiety it will definitely help you and motivate you to practice more meditation and ease your anxiety.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember if your anxiety has a psychological source such as some kind of pain or worry then it may be useful to address those issues first. Ask yourself questions like why am I anxious? Is there a specific reason? Identify the reason and act accordingly. If you have a generalized anxiety disorder then meditation on a daily basis should rid you of anxiety once and for all. </p>

Twenty-seven patients (75%) showed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which in 22 of these cases was the reason for seeking consultation. Children without SVT, 9 (25%), did not need any form of treatment. Twenty-four (889) of the patients with SVT required treatment to prevent recurrence. In the 27 studied episodes of SVT, Verapamil IV (55%) and vagal manoeuvres were the most efficient treatments.

","<p>Unless you live on an area known for having deposits of heavy metals, or you suspect that you have been exposed (in which case you should go see a doctor), your kidneys should be able to take care of the small amounts of heavy metals present in your diet and environment. That being said, heavy metal intoxication can be treated with chelation therapy if needed. There are many drugs for this, most of them target a different metal selectively. This is not exempt of risks and by no means should be performed without medical supervision.</p>

"How can I calculate the daily recommended % value of calcium based on the information I have?","76","","<p>Essentially based on the calcium information I have on these brands of water bottles brands, how can I calculate the daily % value of calcium they give?</p>

Evian water = 78mg/L Calcium</p>
","<p>For calcium it depends on age and gender, as shown in <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/calcium-supplements/art-20047097"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this chart</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yg0rK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yg0rK.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So for a male aged 19-50, 1 liter of Fiji water would be:</p>

<pre><code>17 / 1000 = .017, or 1.7% of the RDV
</code></pre>

<p>And 1 liter of Evian would be:</p>

<pre><code>78 / 1000 = .078, or 7.8% of the RDV
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, if you're looking for calcium in bottled water, you're looking in the wrong place. It's the most expensive possible source of calcium you could choose and not a very good one.</p>

<p>As Mayo notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your body doesn't produce calcium, so you must get it through other
  sources. Calcium can be found in a variety of foods, including:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Dairy products, such as cheese, milk and yogurt</li>
  <li>Dark green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli and kale</li>
  <li>Fish with edible soft bones, such as sardines and canned salmon</li>
  <li>Calcium-fortified foods and beverages, such as soy products, cereal and
  fruit juices, and milk substitutes</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To absorb calcium, your body also needs vitamin D. A few foods
  naturally contain small amounts of vitamin D, such as canned salmon
  with bones and egg yolks. You can also get vitamin D from fortified
  foods and sun exposure. The RDA for vitamin D is 600 international
  units (15 micrograms) a day for most adults.</p>

"How to breath better when you live in a big city?","76","","<p>We know that big cities have bad effects on health, due to their poor quality of air.</p>

<p>The main pollutants we find in the air are PM10, nitrogen dioxyde and ozone. These three pollutants hazardous to health, can cause respiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases , lung cancers and lead to early death (2 million people die each year because of pollution in large cities).</p>

<p>My question is: how can I avoid or reduce the risks of having my health deteriorated because of a bad quality of air?</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>does leave open the window of my room all day is dangerous for me ? </li>
<li>should I avoid walking or running along traffic queues ?</li>
<li>does having indoor plants can benefit me ?</li>
<li>Is wearing a mask the days of high pollution really useful? </li>

<p>I would like to group under this topic the best tips and tricks to breathe better every day . If the subject becomes too big, I will divide it into several questions.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Leave open the window of my room all day is dangerous for me ? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. There are even more particles in a confined room that there is outside.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I avoid walking or running along traffic queues ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes indeed. Forests and parcs are recommended. Trees eat up CO2 during night, so the air is a bit healthier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does having indoor plants can benefit me ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, for the same reasons I mentioned previously. However, don't expect too much...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is wearing a mask the days of high pollution really useful?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the mask, I guess. It should be able to retain at least some of the particles. But I am no expert in pollution mask. Some <a href=""http://respro.com/pollution-masks"" rel=""nofollow"">companies</a> appear having developed high end technology in that.  </p>

<p>The improvements you can get depends on how much you put efforts in this, the way of life (lot of sports ?) and the quality of your city air. However, risk isn't reduced that much.</p>

<p>A bit of an arbitrary example:</p>

<p>Risk of lung cancer (RLC) in a not so polluted city = 1%</p>

"Is the heart disease risk arising from salt mediated entirely by blood pressure?","76","","<p>High salt intake appears to be well-established as a risk-factor for cardiovascular disease, usually cited as being due to its effect of increasing your blood pressure. I want to know if that's the whole story, or if there's evidence that salt affects heart disease risk through other pathways (perhaps not yet identified). For instance, studies might have looked into the risk of salt intake <em>while controlling for blood pressure,</em> but I can't find any.</p>

<p>I'm interested in this because I'd like to consume salt with impunity, and I'm willing to track my blood pressure regularly, so if blood pressure is the whole story then I can just adjust my salt intake later if I find a problem. But if salt is dangerous in ways that I won't be tracking then that's probably not a good plan.</p>
","<p>I think you are onto something.  In the past few years, there have been much research that questions or contradicts the supposedly well-established concensus that we should eat less than 2.3 grams of sodium (included in table salt) per day and preferably even less (1.5 grams per day).  There are several excellent NYT articles on the subject including <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/health/study-linking-illness-and-salt-leaves-researchers-doubtful.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">Study Linking Illness and Salt Leaves Reserachers Doubtful</a> and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/health/panel-finds-no-benefit-in-sharply-restricting-sodium.html"" rel=""nofollow"">No Benefit Seen in Sharp Limits on Salt in Diet</a>.  Thus, based on those mentioned studies within the NYT articles you can probably feel comfortable taking in more sodium (included in table salt) than the standard recommendations.  One of the NYT articles mentioned that review of extensive research indicated that the most favorable health outcomes were associated with sodium intake ranging from 2.645 to 4.945 grams per day.  That's about twice the recommended range mentioned above.  </p>

<p>However, independent of high blood pressure alone, sodium/salt does play a role in kidney health.  The following study has some information on this issue <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12113591"" rel=""nofollow"">Salt Intake and Kidney Disease</a>.  If you belong to a ""salt-sensitive"" demographic group (defined in the study as ""elderly, obese, diabetic or black patients"") you may have to watch out your salt intake somewhat more carefully.  Otherwise, you may be just fine intaking sodium/salt within the mentioned range by the NYT article.    </p>

<p>I understand that lots of pathogens transmit through hands, whether it is through hand shacking or door knobs. However, <strong>it is unclear to me whether our hands carry significantly more pathogens after going to the washroom than before that</strong>.</p>

<p>Is the advice <code>Wash you hands after going to the washroom</code> useful because...</p>

<ul>
<li>our hands are filthier after going to the washroom?</li>
<li>it is just a good way for someone to not forget to wash its hands 5-8 times a day?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Hands play a major role especially in the transmission of blood-borne, fecal, and respiratory tract viruses. </p>

<p><strong>Hand washing after use of bathroom aims at preventing the transmission of pathogens, which rely on faecal-oral transmission</strong>, such as rotavirus, noroviruses, enteroviruses in some cases hepatitis A virus (1). It prevents those pathogens from reaching the kitchen for example where it could lead to subsequent ingestion.</p>

<p>Recently a systematic review (2) identified a total of 2881 unique publications addressing this question.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this study found a varying prevalence of hand-washing after contact with extcreta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We estimate that 19% of people worldwide wash their hands with soap
  after contact with excreta. The regional mean prevalence of
  handwashing with soap ranges between 13% and 17% in low- and
  middle-income regions, and between 42% and 49% in high-income regions</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>However, the authors reported a 40% reduction in the risk of diarrhoea from the promotion of handwashing with soap (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.53–0.68) suggesting that hand-washing impact on faecal oral transmission and reduces risk of diarrhoea.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normally, all the parts of your body are pushing on each other because of the constant force of gravity. But in the ""free-fall"" state of plummeting down a hill, there is hardly any net force acting on you. In this case, the various pieces of your body are not pushing on each other as much. They are all, essentially, weightless, each falling individually inside your body. This is what gives you that unique sinking feeling in your stomach -- your stomach is suddenly very light because there is less force pushing on it. The same thing happens when you drive down a dip in the road in your car or descend in an elevator moving at high speed.</p>

"Can the blood accumulated after stroke be cured?","75","","<p>Recently my uncle had a stroke. He is now in rest and taking medicine. 
He has his right leg paralyzed, although the condition is improving. </p>

<p>The doctor said that ""blood is accumulated in the brain"".</p>

<p>Someone told me that the accumulated blood will not cure totally. But I thought, taking proper medicine can remove the blood. </p>

<p><strong>What does having a stroke mean? What are the outcomes of strokes? Are there any medications to take in case of a stroke?</strong> </p>

<p>EDIT:
Here the findings from the CT Scan
""Subacute infarction in left middle cerebral artery territory""</p>
","<p><em>First of all, I am going to stay quite “general” as I understand you are not from the field. The aim of my post is really to provide some clarifications to your question.</em></p>

<p>There are <strong>two types of strokes</strong>: <strong>ischemic</strong> (approx. 85%) and <strong>hemorrhagic</strong> (approx 15%). As you are speaking of “blood accumulated in the brain” I understand that you mean hemorrhagic stroke (also know as intracerebral hemorrage).</p>

<p>There are different causes for ICH (see table below for an exhaustive list), among which <strong>ruptured aneurysm</strong> (=balloon-like bulge in the wall of a blood vessel), <strong>arterial hypertension</strong> (which leads to chronic modification of the structure blood vessels, which becomes weaken) and <strong>cerebral amyloid antipathy</strong> (= deposition of amyloid which renders the vessel weak and increases its risk of rupture. This occurs often in the elderly)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HYu7V.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HYu7V.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Depending on the location of the ruptured vessel, the brain region and hence the associated clinical symptoms vary.</p>

<p><strong>What happens to the accumulated blood in the brain parenchyma?</strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t stay for ever in the brain. Like in any other regions of the body, the hematoma becomes necrotic over time (=blood cells die). The presence of these cells in the parenchyma leads to an inflammation (+ presence of oedema). In particular, specialised cells (called macrophages) arrive into the zone and start “eating” the dead blood and dead neuronal cells. Below is a table which summarises the change occurring after an ICH:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3LNS.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3LNS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Finally regarding your question on the <strong>outcome</strong>. Well, this depends on several factors. ICH generally show poorer outcomes than ischemic stroke but as I don’t know your uncle’s case it is not possible to give you a prognosis (and probably nobody can, as it depends on so many variables). </p>

<p>However, what has been proven in the literature, is that recovery after a stroke is dependent on the capacity of the brain to “reorganise” and to “adapt” to the neuronal loss. I don’t know in which country you are, but in general, patients with ICH are generally quickly hospitalised in a so called ""stroke unit “ (if no neurosurgical intervention is needed) where intensive physiotherapy is done in order to quickly “train” the brain to develop new neuronal pathways.</p>

<p>Drugs have no impact on accumulated blood. Their main aim is to try to reduce ""further damages"", for example by reducing the hypertension.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (after complement of information from the OP)</strong></p>

<p>So according to the report attached, your uncle suffers from an ischemic stroke (""subacute infarction in the middle left cerebral artery""). This shifts the diagnosis from an hemorrhagic stroke (as you suggested with your description of ""blood accumulated in the brain"") to an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is caused by a ""clot"" which occludes the vessel.</p>

<p>The middle cerebral artery is a common source of ischemic stroke. The most frequent cause is atrial fibrillation (=abnormal rythm of the heart, which makes the heart pump ""inefficiently"" leading to accumulated blood clots to be ejected to the brain).</p>

<p>As from the report, it looks like your uncle had a subacute stroke (= some hours ago), probably your uncle was outside the so called ""lysis"" time, which is the time were lysis (= destruction of the clot which occludes the vessel) can be undertaken.</p>

<p>The therapy is similar to what I have described regarding ICH (particularly regarding physiotherapy). Though, one major difference is that probably a cause for the ischemic stroke will be investigated. Probably he will have a heart rythm investigation and a carotid doppler (= look at the carotid in the neck to see whether there are some stenosis (narrowing of vessel) or plaques). They might also start some drugs which depend on your uncle's situation (anticoagulation, statins,etc...)</p>

<p>Hope this brought some clarification!</p>

","<p>Yes of course ! You can control your angry. But instead of controlling it, you can show it in a peaceful way or forget it. I experienced it lot. Before few years, I used to get angry often. Showing your anger towards others should be in a peaceful manner if you want to show your angry. Count numbers in your mind from 1..10 when you get angry. </p>

<p>Try these simple steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm. Breathing from your chest won't relax you, so picture your breath coming up from your ""gut.</li>
<li>""Slowly repeat a calming word or phrase, such as ""relax"" or ""take it easy."" Keep repeating it to yourself while breathing deeply.</li>
<li>Use imagery. Visualize a relaxing experience from your memory or your imagination.</li>
<li>Try non-strenuous, slow exercises. Yoga and similar activities can relax your muscles and calm you down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Practice these techniques daily. Eventually, you'll be able to use them automatically when you're in a tense situation.</p>

"Increase vision clarity with eye exercices?","75","","<p>I haven't worn my glasses in a like a year and put them on today. I noticed that vision in one eye is slightly ""off"" as in, the glasses rated -2.5 power aren't correcting it fully. The difference isn't staggering but it's definitely noticeable. Is it possible to increase the clarity of my vision by wearing my glasses and doing eye exercises so that I can get back to -2.5 power from whatever it's at right now (possible a little more)? I don't have any knowledge of optometry so apologies if this is a blatantly stupid question.</p>
","<p>I've changed eyeglass prescriptions in the past, which is equivalent to what you're doing. Your eyes are no longer currently accustomed to having that kind of lens in front of them, so it feels the same way it did when you put glasses on for the first time.</p>

<p>I would guess that the -2.5 power is the lens which makes a more significant correction to the lens of one of your eyes. I don't remember the numbers for the lenses of my glasses, but my left eye is further off (more nearsighted) than my right eye, so if I were to not wear glasses for a few days, my left eye would notice it more when I put my glasses back on.</p>

<p>I think it was after I had not worn glasses for a while - maybe months - that my vision was evaluated again, and both eyes had changed. My left eye was less nearsighted and my right eye was more nearsighted. So, I would guess that not wearing glasses makes your eyes exercise harder at focusing, which might change the shape of the lenses in either direction.</p>

<p>Maybe after wearing your old glasses for a couple weeks, giving your eyes a chance to get used to them again, if that eye is still not focusing satisfactorily, you should go to the optometrist and have them see if your eyes have changed. (Two weeks is a rough estimate, but I think it's a good amount of time.)</p>

"The Common Cold - what does the name refer to?","75","","<p>My mother, a school science teacher, is of the opinion that the common cold gains its name from the fact that you can acquire a cold virus more readily when you yourself feel cold. For example, in her view, if you were to spend a day in a cold temperature with inadequate clothing, or spend a long time standing in a rainstorm, you'd increase your chance of catching a cold.</p>

<p>I can see the potential for this to be true - if your body is at an inadequate temperature, it might be more susceptible to catching a cold (or anything for that matter) as your body is busy trying to keep you warm rather than protecting you from disease.</p>

<p>I argue with her, however, as I understand the name of the Common Cold to be referring to the most common symptom of it, in that it makes your body feel cold, causing you to wear extra clothing.</p>

<p>Could someone please enlighten me as to how the Common Cold actually takes its name, is it one of the above alternatives, or something else entirely? As a bonus, is there actually any merit to my mother's logic - is it actually easier to catch a cold when you're physically colder than your body would prefer?</p>
","<p>The thing to recognize is that until the past century, they didn't know that a cold was a virus, but may well have associated it more with actual effects caused by the cold.  Indeed, this line at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> agrees with that:</p>

<p>The name ""cold"" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.</p>

<p>And it references this listing at <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Etymology Online</a> supporting this thinking.</p>

<p>So it's neither based upon the fact the cold can help you catch the virus, as your mom suggests, nor the feelings during the cold.  Instead, it was an archaic belief that the cold made the disease itself.</p>

<p>As to your question on whether cold can help encourage the common cold, <a href=""http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2014/the-reason-for-the-season-why-flu-strikes-in-winter/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Blog from Harvard</a> appears to goes into great detail on the related question for the flu.  They mention the theory that altered human habits in winter very much benefit communicability; we are less active, stay inside more, and have school and large indoor holiday gatherings.</p>

<p>But the summary also references studies investigating direct impacts of temperature.  There were indications that the flu spreads well at any temperature... if the air is dry.  But it only does well in moist air if it is cold.  So it's not all about the temperature, but the moisture/temperature combination.  The blog does mention that there were some oddities to this thinking, though (in tropical locations, they get the flu the worst when it is rainy and slightly cooler).<br>
So a bit of confusion on some points, but additional studies did show that the flu survives in the air better at cooler temperature.</p>

<p>However, the big answer directly to your question is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Palese tested the immune systems of the animals to find out if the
  immune system functions poorly at low temperatures and low humidity,
  but he found no difference in innate immunity among the guinea pigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So, long story short, studies on the flu suggest that the temperature doesn't weaken your body (though certainly it seems likely it would if you were exposed for extreme periods of time!), but that it does offer some conditions which help the germs survive better.</strong></p>

1-My wife (virgin, early 20's) have a thick hymen (my guess).
First three times we tried to have intercourse she felt so much pain and each time she bled (not much), till now each time we try penetration she feel intolerable pain and screams VERY loudly (to the point that i get scared for her well-being).
I tried to insert my finger there, it went smoothly with some minor discomfort on her side, then i tried 2 fingers, it went through also with some minor pain.
We tried to apply an Anesthetic Gel (Lidocaine) on her hymen area, but it didn't help the pain.
Also we tried ""Durex Play"" lube but she felt very bad burning (obviously ""Play"" does not Play nice with cuts)
At this point i'm out of ideas and don't know what to do.</p>

<p>2-My second problem is: We take our time during foreplay, mostly i give her oral (around 15-20 mins), during that time i'm rock hard, when she gets really wet and i try to penetrate, the moment i approach and get in the right position, i got flaccid  :( it is like magic ! It is happening every time now !</p>

<p>Any help regarding the 2 problems would be much appreciated :(</p>
","<p>Disclaimer: Health Stack Exchange is for educational purposes. I speak about these problems in general; I cannot give you health advice.</p>

<p>There are several possible causes for insertional pain like you described. Women with these symptoms may have anatomical issues that make penetration painful and/or difficult (such as a thick hymen). If there are any lesions in the vaginal area, such as warts, sexually transmitted diseases, or (perhaps most likely here) unhealed areas from earlier intercourse, these all can definitely cause pain.</p>

<p>Lastly, some women experience involuntary muscle spasms with penetration, which makes penetration VERY painful to her. This is often involuntary, and it isn't ""just in your head"", however it is most frequent in women with anxiety about sex, holding personal taboos or having an upbringing with strong social/cultural taboos against sex, or a history of physical or emotional trauma. Having that kind of history is not required though. Treatment involves psychotherapy and techniques to gradually help her relax those muscles (it does not happen overnight).</p>

<p>As L.B. said, perhaps there are cuts there from earlier, in which the best thing may be to let them heal before irritating that area. Any of the other causes can definitely benefit from seeing a gynecologist, as doctors can help all of these issues.</p>

<p>Sounds like sex has been stressful for you both! I hope you are able to relax, smile, and accept that this may take some time before it goes smoothly.</p>

"Normal for menstruation blood to be brown/black at the start?","74","","<p>Lately, in addition to the more intense abdominal pain than usual, my period is manifesting itself in dark brown/black (tarry-like) blood from the start and staying like that for almost 5 days until it finally turns the bright red. </p>

<p><strong>Is this something to be concerned about? Does menstrual blood change in colour during menstruation?</strong> </p>
","<p><strong>Menstrual blood is composed of a mixture of blood (blood cells), vaginal secretions, endometrial cells and inflammatory cells.</strong></p>

<p><em>I have found no study investigating the change in colour of mentruation blood .</em></p>

<p>However, the presence of endometrial cells (mucosa lining of the uterus) and necrotic cells (from the endometrium) is supposed to be highest during the first days of menstruation where the stratum functionalis gets cleaved from the stratum basalis in the endometrium.</p>

<p>During the end of menstruation most of these cells have been expulsed and the new lining of the endometrial wall has developed, slowly ""covering"" previous bleeding vessels from the underlying mucosa. 
This could possibly explain the change in colour you are mentionning. </p>

<p>Some weeks ago, I have answered a question on the menstrual cycle including some points regarding the uterine wall and its changes during the cycle:

"Prepare tea directly in water boiler - dangerous?","74","","<p>Is it dangerous to prepare tea directly in a water boiler?

How often should you clean the container thoroughly using strong detergents? </p>
","<p>Although the initial question seems crazy enough from the start, the preamble to this answer has to make it clear that you should not use a water boiler with tea – or anything else but water – in it. This answer has to assume that the question is about: only green tea or plain water used directly in the boiler. </p>

<p>Boiling <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/tea-fact-sheet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tea</a>, and especially <a href=""https://nccih.nih.gov/health/greentea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">green tea</a>, will absolutely ruin the <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/how-to-brew-green-tea-where-to-buy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">taste</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steeping too hot or for too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to go the convenience path that seems to have inspired this idea: put your <a href=""http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/tea#safety"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tea</a> into a cup and put that into <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/23/never-boil-water-twice-making-cuppa-tea-guru-warns/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a microwave</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, extraordinarily, Mr Gorman advocates something which - had they been invented - Orwell would surely have balked at; using a microwave to make tea.
  Mr Gorman, whose organisation represents tea packers, brokers and importers, said: ""Usually when people's tea goes cold they reboil the kettle and make another cup. But doing this you are guaranteed to give yourself a dull cup of tea. You need freshly drawn water for a good cup because reboiling it takes out all the oxygen and nitrogen out of it.”</p>
  
  <p>He added: ""A better solution is to put it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds. When you microwave tea all you're doing is from a scientific point of view is just moving the molecules around and getting it back up to a decent temperature. It is not impacting the flavour at all.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cleaning the water boiler with strong detergents <a href=""http://oem.bmj.com/content/41/2/279.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">may leave some of these detergents behind</a>. That is presumably the most dangerous health problem with the approach outlined in the question (provided that the kettle itself is really fit for food grade application).</p>

<p>If the discolouration bothers you or starts to impact the boiling efficiency: soak it in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">soda</a>. Tea stain will then come off so easily that you might use a very mild and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25560657"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eco-friendly</a> simple soap to keep it shiny clean. Rinse thoroughly.</p>

<p>You won't attempt brain surgery with shards from your kettle? So it becomes an argument of common sense that you will not need absolute sterility. Boiling <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3545/why-is-it-a-bad-idea-to-re-heat-drinking-water"">fresh water</a> of <a href=""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/B:RESB.0000040010.64651.f9.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decent quality</a> will kill enough microorganisms (that will be in there in very small numbers to begin with). <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/should-you-sterilize-your-babys-bottles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Even baby bottles are now free from this germ-o-phobe advice.</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that high quality tea like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyokuro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gyokuro</a> or Fancy White should be prepared with a water temperature of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea#Brewing_and_serving"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>below</em> 70°C</a>! Tea can also be <a href=""https://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cold brewed</a> (no sterilisation at all).</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tea_in_China"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inventors of tea</a> have the following to say:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixing_clay_teapot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yixing clay teapot</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yixing teapots are meant for use with black and oolong teas, as well as aged pǔ’ěr tea. They can also be used for green or white tea, but the water must be allowed to cool to around 85 °C (185 °F) before pouring the water into the pot. Yixing teapots absorb a tiny amount of tea into the pot during brewing. After prolonged use, the pot will develop a coating that retains the flavour and colour of the tea. It is for this reason that soap should not be used to clean Yixing teapots. Instead, it should be rinsed with fresh water and allowed to air-dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://verdanttea.com/how-to-season-yixing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Season an Yixing Teapot</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other info: Never use anything but water to clean an yixing pot. Soap will be absorbed and create a permanent soapy flavor in the tea you steep. Always allow your yixing pot to dry completely between uses, and before replacing the lid and storing. A teapot stored wet with the lid on will mold. If your teapot molds, reboil for 10-15 minutes and re-season. Take a picture of your pot when you start using it so that you can compare in a year to see how it has grown. </p>

"Preventing diabetes mellitus","74","","<p>I am 16 year old boy. My father as well as my relatives have diabetes mellitus. If i start going to gym, get into some body building and maintain a healthy lifestyle from now on, can i prevent it?</p>
","<p>Generally, Diabetes Mellitus is categorized into Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational diabetes.The type that you are concerned with is type 2 in which genetic factor plays a major role.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 2 diabetes is a disease that is fundamentally caused by a mismatch between our genetic makeup and our lifestyle choices, namely diet and physical activity. Numerous genes have been identified as risk factors. Among them about 10 genes are thoroughly studied for their causative etiology. Variations in these genes confer some impairment in insulin secretion and/or utilization, glucose and/or lipid homeostasis.<a href=""https://www.gbhealthwatch.com/science-portal-diabetes-genes.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or the onset delayed, through positive lifestyle changes. It is estimated that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be reduced by up to 58% by maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active and following a healthy eating plan.
There are numerous ways of preventing the diabetes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining a healthy weight</p></li>
<li><p>Regular physical activity</p></li>
<li><p>Making healthy food choices</p></li>
<li><p>Managing blood pressure</p></li>
<li><p>Managing cholesterol levels</p></li>
<li><p>Not smoking.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Talking about exercise, it helps to decrease obesity, helps your body increase its sensitivity to insulin. Muscular activity induces glucose entry into muscle cells without the need for insulin. As such, exercise has insulin sparing effect.</p>

"Why don't leave HIV infected people in aseptic environment until they're cured?","74","","<p>Sorry if the question is silly, but this is something that has been around my head for years:</p>

<p>As far as I know, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HIV</a>irus <em>feeds</em> itself out of the inmune cells (from Wikipedia, emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system</strong> such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. <strong>When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I thought that HIV victims die out of diseases that they will survive if they weren't infected by HIV. In other words: HIV destroys the immune system and then the person dies because of a different cause.</p>

<p>If this is true, why isn't posible to keep HIV infected people in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Boy_(film)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aseptic environments</a> waiting for the virus to consume all the immune cells and ""<em>die out of starvation</em>""?</p>
","<p>There are three major reasons why we can't just keep someone in an aseptic environment and wait for their CD4 count to drop to zero and - presumably - for HIV to have consumed itself to extinction in the patient:</p>

<ol>
<li>Time. In the Pre-HAART era in a middle-income country like <a href=""https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-014-0599-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brazil</a>, the median survival time for someone with AIDS was 1.1 years, but that can be a very long tailed distribution. That's <em>extremely</em> expensive, and the logistical capacity to keep someone in perfect isolation and containment for that period of time doesn't really exist on a population scale. And keep in mind you'd have to be <em>perfect</em> that entire time, with no room for errors of any sort, as you're essentially allowing people to become extremely immune compromised. That's not at all practical, even on a theoretical level.</li>
<li>Native flora, cancers, etc. An HIV+ individual still has their own native flora, which may become dangerous due to a compromised immune system, such as <em><a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/814253"" rel=""noreferrer"">C. difficile</a></em>. They may have been previously infected by a dormant herpes virus. And they're at <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hiv-fact-sheet"" rel=""noreferrer"">higher risk of cancers</a>, only some of which are infectious in origin and thus could be prevented in a perfectly sterile environment.</li>
<li>HAART. HAART therapy is awesome, and while not a cure for HIV/AIDS, is an extremely effective treatment for the disease. Any amount of money used keeping people in perfectly sterile isolation for years on end is likely better spent increasing screening and access to HAART.</li>

<p>Yes. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For years, flu vaccines were designed to protect against three different flu viruses (trivalent). This included an influenza A H1N1 virus, an influenza A H3N2 virus and one B virus. Experts had to choose one B virus, even though there are two very different lineages of B viruses that both circulate during most seasons. This meant the vaccine did not protect against the group of B viruses not included in the vaccine. Adding another B virus to the vaccine aims to give broader protection against circulating flu viruses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quadrivalent flu vaccine is also just as safe as the trivalent one. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studies have shown that vaccines made to protect against four flu viruses have a safety profile similar to seasonal flu vaccines made to protect against three viruses, with similar—mostly mild—side effects</p>

<p>Now why would people choose the trivalent one? </p>

<p>For one, the quadrivalent flu vaccine is more expensive. According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">CDC</a> the difference is more than 50 percent. This probably means there is a market for it, so it still gets produced.</p>

<p>Also, some patients (and some doctors) will be cautious about anything they perceive as new and ""untested"" and thus prefer the old one for a few more years. That's another reason to still produce and ship the trivalent flu vaccine. </p>

<p>If the quadrivalent flu vaccine is not available (for example because not enough was ordered), taking the trivalent flu vaccine is recommended over waiting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t delay getting a flu vaccine if you cannot locate a quadrivalent vaccine. The important thing is to get vaccinated against influenza. </p>

<p>I've been working with the same company for almost 11 years. The first 2 and a half years I was at another building until they moved my department to another one. My health at that building was never in question, didn't seem like anything effected me at all.</p>

<p>I know ever since coming into this building my allergies started getting worse and my sinuses would bother me really bad as well. Literally I could walk into the building and my eyes would turn bloodshot red because of whatever is in the building.</p>

<p>Lately when I've been coming into work, I feel so tired/fatigued after being in the building for about 10-15 minutes or so, and it doesn't go away. <em>I know they found mold in the building before when they stripped down the wallpaper.</em> </p>

<p>Can mold in a building cause fatigue?</p>
","<p>Yes, it's certainly possible that there is mold or other agents in the building that can be either causing or contributing to allergy and fatigue symptoms.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sick-building-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a writeup</a> on what is called sick building syndrome (SBS) from National Health in the UK. <a href=""http://drhoffman.com/article/molds-mites-and-pollens-common-causes-of-allergic-fatigue-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a writeup</a> on various agents that can cause the same symptoms from a doctor's blog.

<li>nausea </li>
<li>aches and pains </li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>poor concentration   </li>

"Does the body adapt to recurring blunt force trauma?","73","","<p>If skin is constantly scraped or rubbed, callouses form and the body better deals with future scrapes and rubs.</p>

<p>Is there any process in which we adapt to being hit by blunt objects?

<p><strong>These are your skin's layers and components.</strong> When being hit by something, everything you see gets either damaged or destroyed. 
Bruising is caused by the blood that escapes the broken capillaries.</p>

<p>In a ""recurring blunt force trauma"" those capillaries are not allowed to heal.</p>

<p>Same thing happens to everything you see above including the sensory nerve fibers and in the long run, touch sense is affected. You might call this an ""adaptation"" but it's certainly not beneficial.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now regarding the <strong>bones</strong> underneath all this, there's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolff's law</a> which states that bone in a healthy person or animal will adapt to the loads under which it is placed. If loading on a particular bone increases, the bone will remodel itself over time to become stronger to resist that sort of loading.</p>

<p>Load though doesn't mean hit, so it doesn't apply to that!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, your body certainly kind of adapts to situations like ""being hit blunt objects"" by losing the sense of touch, but you don't ""get better at it"", you just feel the damage a little bit less because you've already destroyed a lot of sensory nerves.</p>

"Is it OK to snack on salted nuts for a high-fibre diet?","73","","<p>I like to snack on nuts as part of ensuring a high-fibre diet, but I prefer the taste of salted nuts over non-salted.  Will eating salted nuts cause me significant dehydration or other health issues?  Is it likely to cause me to have too high a daily salt intake?  Or is it basically OK?</p>
","<p>Like most foods, salt should be consumed in moderation. Your body needs salt, but a good idea would be to try and cut down salt from some other parts of your diet. For example, get unsalted fries or no ketchup. Check the daily recommended value for an estimate of how much salt you're intaking. Furthermore (thanks to Carey Gregory for pointing this out), drinking water may NOT be the best idea to offset the sodium intake. According to dietitian Monica Reinagel(from LiveStrong link), </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""drinking some extra water after a high-sodium meal may help flush
  some of the sodium from your body and may also help get rid of some
  retained water to reduce bloating...</p>
  
  <p>Just drinking more water, however, is <strong><em>not a solution for a long-term
  high-sodium diet</em></strong>, says Reinagel. The increased blood volume that
  results from your body holding onto the excess water is what <strong>raises
  your blood pressure</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So depending on the rest of your diet, you could better judge for yourself whether salted nuts are ok, or maybe unsalted would be better.</p>

<p>If you happen to have a high-sodium diet and don't like the taste of unsalted nuts, it would be a good time to look into alternative sources of fiber.</p>

"Pre diabetic after fasting blood work?","73","","<p>So I have been feeling very lethargic the past year and went in to get some blood work.  I fasted for 12 hours prior to test, with the exception of mint that I had that morning hour before test that had sorbitol and less than a gram of sugar.</p>

<p>I'm in terrific shape and have a squeaky clean diet (FODMAP for the past 2 years because its easy on my stomach) yet my blood sugar levels came back at 106 mg/dL and that is considered pre diabetic when you're fasting.  Normal is 65-99 mg/dL.</p>

<p>So do you believe that the mint heightened my blood sugar that much that I should retake the test?  </p>

<p>I have not spoken to my doctor about it yet (results emailed to me) and have been trying to do some research prior so I can be prepared to have any additional questions.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Not sure if it matters, but I'm 185 lbs, 7.5% body fat and workout 6 days per week.  From all that I read, it looks like the results indicate that I'm moving towards type 2 diabetes?  Better yet, the best way to prevent it is to eat healthy and exercise more.  I could break down my diet easily since I eat the same thing daily and record calories, fat, carbs, protein and it's all low on the glycemic index :(</p>
","<p><strong>Retest</strong></p>

<p>I generally retest and don't base decisions on a single reading. Although the impact of the mint would seem minimal, the abnormal result itself deserves repeating.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, insulin resistance has become a huge problem and I see it all the time in clinical practice and am no longer surprised when a fit appearing person or an athlete I work with has abnormal glucose metabolism.</p>

<p>Another test(s) to consider would be a fasting insulin and a 2 hour glucose tolerance test. An A1C can be useful combined with other tests.</p>

<p>The approach to figuring out your actual question - Am I pre-diabetic? hinges on the viewpoint of the treating physician.</p>

<p>From a functional medicine approach, normal is often pathologic.  For example, using a normal A1C to exclude insulin resistance and prediabetes will miss a large number of people already in trouble. </p>

<p>Glucose tolerance testing is considered gold standard by many functional medicine experts. A 2-hour reading of 120-139 indicated >60% loss of pancreas Beta cell function (decreased insulin production). A 1-hour 120 or above indicates insulin resistance. </p>

<p>Lipids are also important in determining the risk and using a ratio of triglycerides to HDL (good cholesterol) can help identify insulin resistance.</p>

<p>These silicones are the same stuff which you get in hair conditioner.

Do nuts carry too many carbohydrates to be considered a good snack while conforming to a ketogenic eating philosophy?</p>
","<p>It depends on the nut. Almonds and macadamia nuts tend to be staples in the keto diet due to low carbs and high fat, especially the macadamia nuts.

<p>Is this true?</p>

","<p>Cold water definitely doesn't cause arthritis but it certainly helps to release muscle stress. Infact hot and cold therapy is suggested to patients with arthritis. When you run you cause wear and tear in your muscles and also sweat causing your body temperature to rise. Cold water brings your heated muscles back to homeostasis faster than your body will. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of joints which is caused by excessive wear and tear and unless you allow your body(immune system) to heal those microtrauma in your leg muscles caused by running you might eventually cause inflammation which is what arthritis is. A healthy immune system is protective. It generates internal inflammation to get rid of infection and prevent disease. But the immune system can mistakenly attack the joints with uncontrolled inflammation, potentially causing joint erosion.</p>

","<p>Yes, it can.</p>

<p>The ""master clock"" of your body is the <strong>suprachiasmatic nucleus</strong> of the hypothalamus. It receives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Neuronal input from the retina, through the retino-hypothalamic tract.</li>
<li>Hormonal input, as the suprachiasmatic nucleus expresses melatonin receptors. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in response to the absence of light. The pineal gland itself does not contain light receptors, but it received information indirectly: the retino-hypothalamic tract sends the information from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. From there, the information is sent to the intermediolateral column of the spine cord, where there are synapses with pre-ganglionic neurons which also synapse with post-ganglionic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion. The superior cervical ganglion then sends the information through the carotid plexus and to the pineal gland [Retina -> Suprachiasmatic Nucleus -> Intermediolateral Column -> Superior Cervical Ganglion -> Carotid Plexus -> Pineal Gland].</li>
</ul>

<p>Through these signals, the suprachiamastic nucleus is capable of setting the circadian clock. In the absence of these input, the internal circadian clock is actually 25,3 hrs long, instead of the usual 24 hrs that our day has.

<p>But I'm still a little scared because I had sex without a condom after the week and I'm just paranoid. So can someone tell me how effective this pill is and the percentage of pregnancy risk and any other facts I need to know about the pill?</p>
","<p>In essence there is a very good answer already provided here:
<a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28942/does-taking-birth-control-pills-make-you-99-9-protected-from-pregnancy"">https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28942/does-taking-birth-control-pills-make-you-99-9-protected-from-pregnancy</a></p>

<p>The effectiveness of the ""pill"" in terms of birth control will depend largely on how accurately you are following the advice given by your doctor / pharmacist on how and when to take it.</p>

<p>Technically, if you are following the procedure correctly, it should be a very effective method of birth control and works in up to 99.9% of cases:
<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills</a></p>

<p>Now, that is not 100% and certainly there are different studies out there, which will provide different results. Essentially, what this means is that you can still get pregnant this way. I don't want to scare you and the probability is low, but you should know that it is still possible. If you forget to take it one day, the probability obviously increases ...</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>

<p>You also absolutely need to know that the ""pill"" does not protect you from any sexually transmittable diseases! I trust you know this and your partner knows this, too.</p>

<p>A little off-topic:</p>

<p><em>If either of you hasn't gotten a HIV test - don't be naive - go and get it done! You need to know that it can take 3 months before this blood test may reliably detect HIV, so if either of you had a different partner in the last three months, it's not worth it - don't risk it!
You need to be sure about this. The number of new HIV infections is actually <strong>increasing</strong> in the western world, even though free HIV tests are available to many. This is true all across the US, Australia and Europe: <a href=""http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2015/11/highest-number-of-new-hiv-cases-in-europe-ever"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2015/11/highest-number-of-new-hiv-cases-in-europe-ever</a></em></p>

"How to clean out all the earwax buildup in ears from hearing-aids if hearing-impaired? Q-tips are unsafe, right?","70","","<p>I was born with congenital bone fusions in several places in my body, one of those places are in the set of three small bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) in both my ears. Because they are fused, they don't vibrate. I've had several ear surgeries, which have unfortunately only caused nerve-damage and scar-tissue so I'm hearing-impaired. Bottom-line: <strong>I've been wearing hearing-aids my entire life.</strong> </p>

<p>Growing up, I would always use a Q-tip to clean out the earwax buildup in my ears <strong>(hearing-aids are constantly in my ears so they don't allow my ears to ""breathe"" and trap in a lot of bacteria)</strong>. However, as research became more available as the years went by, audiologists and doctors alike have told me that Q-tips are not the best way to clean out your ears. In fact, they have the potential to cause further damage to your ears because you may just be jamming the earwax further down your ear canal, which can lead to infections/inflammations/loss of hearing, etc. </p>

<p>So the alternative method to cleaning out my ears with a Q-tip was to blow-dry them when I got out of the shower. I did this for a few years until the audiologists said that even though the blow-dryer doesn't sound too loud to me, I could be causing a lot of damage to my ear drums. </p>

<p>I don't recall what the alternative cleaning method has since been. <strong>How do I clean out my ears on a regular/daily basis?</strong> Yes, I am fully aware that a doctor can flush out the earwax, but I don't have the time nor the money to constantly be seeing the doctor since I have earwax everyday due to my hearing aids. I have a lot. </p>

<p><strong>What is the safest, most effective, yet realistic/practical method?</strong></p>
","<p>I am not aware of any evidence based research looking at the efficacy of at home ear wax removal. In general the goal is not to make your ear canals 100% free of wax at the microscopic level. Rather, the goal is remove blockages and NOT damage the ear canal. The <a href=""http://www.entnet.org/content/earwax-and-care"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Academy of Otolaryngolgoy</a> recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.</p>
  
  <p>Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The VDRL and RPR, respectively, are reactive in 78 percent and 86 percent of patients with primary syphilis. They become positive within approximately four to six weeks after infection or one to three weeks after the appearance of the primary lesion. Thus, these tests can be negative in early syphilis, when patients have lesions. </p>

<p>This means that a test could be incorrectly negative if:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The person is not in the 78% (VDRL) or 86% (RPR) of people with the disease that the test is able to identify correctly</p></li>
<li><p>The test is done before the body has made enough antibodies for the test to detect them yet</p></li>
</ol>

<p>FTA-ABS is <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/229461-workup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">often used as a confirmatory test</a> after a positive VDRL or RPR.  Sensitivity is 84% in primary syphilis and nearly 100% in later stages. Its specificity is 96%.</p>

<p>Usually clinicians start with a screening test like RPR, then if it's positive, follow up with a confirmatory test.  </p>

<p>Ideally screening tests should be highly sensitive (rule out); confirmatory tests should be highly specific (rule in).</p>

"Blue cheese antibiotics","69","","<p>If someone eats blue cheese (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_cheese"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">which is manufactured with some variety of the penicillium mold</a>) while they are sick, does this a have any effect on creating antibiotic resistant bacteria? </p>
","<p>Well, yes, but don't worry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New antibiotics that are active against resistant bacteria are required. Bacteria have lived on the Earth for several billion years. During this time, they encountered in nature a wide range of naturally occurring antibiotics. To survive, bacteria developed antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have become resistant to most of the natural antimicrobial agents that have been developed over the past 50 years. This resistance increasingly limits the effectiveness of current antimicrobial drugs. The problem is not just antibiotic resistance but also multidrug resistance. [From: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/ja/journal/v62/n1/full/ja200816a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microbial drug discovery: 80 years of progress</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium_roqueforti"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Penicillium roqueforti</a> is in a constant fight with bacteria since 'forever' using its antibiotics to gain the upper hand when used in cheese. Those bacteria responsible for any infection coming into contact with those antibiotics and surviving the encounter will be somehow more resistant to those chemicals than before the encounter. They may have very well been resistant to those before. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.springer.com/de/book/9780387708409"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">These survivors may be naturally resistant to the antibiotic ingested, or they may have acquired resistance during therapy. Sometimes the patient was already colonized with resistant organisms before treatment had even begun.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is of a very small concern because blue cheese mould are not producing antibiotics or other chemicals of use as a medical agent for pathogenic human infections with bacteria. Those <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefortine_C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chemicals</a> are either <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arved_Lompe/publication/291983856_Die_gesundheitliche_Unbedenklichheit_von_Penicillium_caseicolum_P_camemberti_and_P_roqueforti_II_Biologische_Prufung_auf_Toxinbildungsvermogen_an_Zellkulturen_The_harmlessness_to_health_of_Penicillium/links/56af4d9308aeaa696f2fe2ce/Die-gesundheitliche-Unbedenklichheit-von-Penicillium-caseicolum-P-camemberti-and-P-roqueforti-II-Biologische-Pruefung-auf-Toxinbildungsvermoegen-an-Zellkulturen-The-harmlessness-to-health-of-Penicill.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very weak</a> or in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2231314"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very low</a> concentrations.</p>

<p>Penicillium is a very large group of species and not every member of this family produces useful drugs. Resistance to antibiotics is an evolutionary process and evolution favours minimalism in regard to developing new features. Eating these cheeses, if properly prepared and stored, should not increase resistance against prescription drugs we use currently under the term antibiotics. </p>

<p>So, after detailing some very nit-picky technicalities let me clarify my opening statement to: No.  These cheeses will not cause problems with resistance to prescription drugs.</p>

"Can i do pranayama when i am suffering from asthma?","69","","<p>I have asthma. I heard that Pranayama is a remedy for asthma. So, what type of  precautions would I need to take? And in how many days would you see expect to see the results?</p>
","<p>I'm a physical therapist and do yoga in my free-time. So I'll provide some of the information I have.</p>

<p>Pranayama exercises and active/passive techniques that are used in physical therapy to treat asthma are very similar.</p>

<p>You cannot cure asthma with any of those two methods, but it can lead to bettering of the symptoms and it gets easier to deal with asthmatic attacks, when you know some techniques that help you get over an asthmatic attack. </p>

<p>Concepts, that are used:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Consciousness for your breathing</strong> - Pranayama uses different approaches to make you more conscious of your breathing (where do you feel movement, when you breath? stomach? ribcage? shoulders? how fast do you breath? do you breath through mouth or nose? ...) and helps you breath more deeply or let's say effectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breathing techniques</strong> - Pranayama uses exercises to help you deepen your breath.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Body postures</strong> - differents asanas (well this is not pranayama itself, but yoga after all) stretch the respirational muscles (pectoralis major and minor, scm, and so on) and the intercostal muscles - this makes breathing easier and deeper. Your muscles get tense, when you have asthma/asthmatic attacks, so stretching helps your muscles relax so they can work more efficiently.
Example asanas: <a href=""http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/tias-little-sidebending-sequence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/tias-little-sidebending-sequence/</a> - but please find an instructor to help you with this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Body in space</strong> - the way your body is seated in the 3 dimensions, affects your lungs. The lower half of the lung is supplied better with blood (due to gravity) and the upper half is better ventilated. So lying on your right side, doing some breathing exercises has a different effect on either side of your lungs.
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation/perfusion_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation/perfusion_ratio</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd recomment to find a competent yoga instructor, who can provide you with more information and can lead you through some exercises.</p>

<p>I have worked with long-term patients, who profitted from weekly sessions and exercising at home daily. Sessions can last between only a few minutes up to an hour, where the above mentioned concepts are combined.
E.g. you start on your back and get conscious of your breathing. afterwards you are lying on your right side, lay your arm over your head, so the left ribcage is stretched and you do a breathing technique(pranayama). after a few minutes you turn on your back and feel teh difference between your two body sides and how your breathing has changed. then do the same exercise for your other side.
But again, find an instructor to help you with this.</p>

<p>As I said it does not provide a remedy, but helps you deal with the symptoms.</p>

<li>I've heard that a few people have actually been <strong><em>born</em></strong> with the <strong><em>tailbone appendages</em></strong> -- is this accurate? I suspect that they were surgically removed when the baby was born. What is the name for when someone is born with the actual tailbone appendage? </li>
<li>Also, is the condition of <strong><em>spina bifida</em></strong> the condition were the
fetus started to grow a tail, but it never fully developed?</li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>1.</strong> You are right, the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail, but still not entirely useless.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/309486-overview#a4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eMedicine</a>, it is an important attachment for various muscles, tendons and ligaments—which makes it necessary for physicians and patients to pay special attention to these attachments when considering surgical removal of the coccyx. Additionally, it is also a part of the weight-bearing tripod structure which acts as a support for a sitting person. When a person sits leaning forward, the ischial tuberosities and inferior rami of the ischium take most of the weight, but as the sitting person leans backward, more weight is transferred to the coccyx.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> It's not actually accurate for a child to be born with a tailbone appendage. <a href=""https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aorth/2011/153797/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The dorsal cutaneous appendage, or so-called human tail</a> is a rare congenital anomaly with a prominent lesion from the lumbosacrococcygeal region. It is also often considered to be a cutaneous marker of underlying occult dysraphism. You are right again, there has been a report of a 9 - month old healthy male infant brought for consultation for a “tail like” structure in the lumbosacral area since birth. </p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> No, it isn't. Spina bifida is a condition where the spine does not develop properly, leaving a gap in the spine. The spine consists of the spinal column, which is a solid structure made up of bones (called vertebral bodies) separated by discs of fibrous tissue.  Behind this is an enclosed space called the spinal canal, which contains the spinal cord. The spinal cord connects all the nerves in the body to the brain. The canal is surrounded by arches of bone attached to the backs of the vertebral bodies. </p>

<p>In cases of spina bifida, something goes wrong and the arches of bone do not fully close. Sometimes there is only a gap in the bony arch, but at other times the spinal cord is also involved and does not form properly either. The skin over the arch can also either be intact or have a gap as well.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of information, to explain what I mean with an ""abnormal amount"":</p>

<ul>
<li><p>visibly seeing the moisture on hands and feet (there doesn't seem to be a pattern as to when this occurs, though)</p></li>
<li><p>sweat hindering normal day-to-day functions: reading books, writing, shaking hands, playing sports (tennis racket slipping, ...), etc. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What is this called, what causes it, and how common is it? </p>

<p>Is there a standard way to treat / handle it, permanently or temporarily?</p>
","<p>What you are describing is most likely <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis"" rel=""nofollow"">hyperhidrosis</a>, a disorder that causes excessive sweating. It  This sweating usually occurs on the underarms (axillary) or the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar). </p>

<p>There is also another type of classification for hyperhidrosis. Primary hyperhidrosis (more common) is excessive sweating not related to another medical condition or medication, while secondary hyperhidrosis <em>is</em> related to a medication or medical condition. Some other differences are that sweating from primary hyperhidrosis does not typically occur while sleeping and that primary hyperhidrosis onsets earlier than secondary hyperhidrosis.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21334095"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup> If you don't have another medical condition or take any medications that may cause the sweating, then the condition you most likely have is primary palmoplantar hyperhidrosis.</p>

<p>The cause of primary hyperhidrosis is mostly related to your genetics, rather than any external causes. Overactive sweat glands are the most common cause and hyperhidrosis is known to run in the family. What actually triggers the sweating to occur is much harder to pin down. Heat can be a trigger, as well as anxiety, but the sweating can occur randomly at nearly all times.</p>

<p>Besides sweating, there are some other possible side effects of hyperhidrosis. One study<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19395123"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></sup> concluded that patients with hyperhidrosis were at an increased risk of skin infection. This can be dealt with by treating your hyperhidrosis, though.</p>

<p>Treating primary hyperhidrosis can be as easy as using prescription or even over-the-counter antipersperants. If those don't work, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iontophoresis"" rel=""nofollow"">iontophoresis</a> has been known to help, especially with palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, which would be especially useful in your case. In incredibly drastic circumstances, surgery is available as a last resort. This surgery would involve removing some of the sweat glands. The surgeries have been known to be safe and effective.<sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7601951"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9013011"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a></sup></p>

"Getting rid of white spots on front teeth","69","","<p>Wearing braces can lead to some very visible color changes.</p>

<p>Very often some parts are darker than others and ""white spots"" appear.</p>

<p>Heavy brushing of the teeth is not a good idea since this will not work well and also erodes too much of the enamel.</p>

<p>If a professional teeth whitening performed by a dentist is not preferred or not an option then other remedies that are often recommended include special toothpastes, sodium bicarbonate or over the counter whitening strips.</p>

<p>These options may be unsafe or ineffective.</p>

<p>What options do exist to improve the aesthetics of the teeth in such a situation?
Mainly this means: how were these spots formed and how to get rid of the white spots safely?</p>
","<p>Currently, there are three options to deal with white spots in frontal teeth after orthodontic treatment: </p>

<ol>
<li>remineralization,</li>
<li>micro-abrasion, and </li>
<li>resin infiltration.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are several case report about micro-abrasion and resin infiltration, and some clinical trials about all, but a recent <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27030284"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">systematic review</a> found the evidence of effectiveness was rated as low, that means that the results are inconsistent or there is a high risk of bias, i.e. the manufacturers of the products published the results. </p>

<p>The three options are different: 
<strong>Remineralization</strong> uses fluoride aiming to add something to the surfaces layer of the tooth.   There are some clinical trials showing positive results (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887683) and others showing no effect (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27480987). But the advantge of a non invasive therapy is that there is no loss of enamel surface, hence there is no irreversible alteration to the tooth surface. </p>

<p><strong>Microabrasion</strong> on the other hand smooth irreversibly the surface of the eroded enamel with an acid. </p>

<p>Finally, <strong>infiltration</strong>, also irreversibly treatment, use an acid to remove a small layer of the eroded enamel and then add a resin layer. From the esthetic point of view this solve the issue immediately, but the lack of prospective studies add an interrogation mark to the long term results. </p>

<p>Hence, from all the three options, currently the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27907894"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">remineralization</a> is the only that is non-invasive. </p>

<p>Are all flatulence/gasses passed comprised of methane (and potentially flammable)? Or is that dependent on the food we eat and the type of gut-microbiota we have to break down and digest the food? Or how long the food ferments in our GI tract? </p>

<p>Is burpring/belching comprised of the same elements? Or is that mainly trapped air? I'm assuming that it wouldn't have methane or flammable qualities, correct? </p>

<p>P.S. It isn't my intention to have a juvenile discussion about this (I know this is a social taboo -- not proper etiquette), but I sincerely would like to know the answer to this, and I apologize if this offends anyone. </p>
","<p>Most of the gas you produce from swallowed air is made up of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The bacteria in your intestines give your farts their unique smell and makes them flammable. Methane and hydrogen in these bacteria-produced farts are the flammable chemicals that make the exploding fart possible.</p>

<p>A fart contains the gas methane produced during digestion of food in the lower gastrointestinal tract. However burbs are a result of air that is taken down the oesophagi and/or carbon dioxide dues to gastric acid reacting with a base (alkaline) in food. </p>

<p>Carbon dioxide isn't flammable but Methane is.</p>

<hr>

<p>What vitamins (dietary supplements or some other substances) for internal taking will be useful for the skin? Thanks.</p>
","<p>The process of wound healing is extremely complex and combines several processes that occur after the injury. According to '<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=m_etDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;ots=IlPeqkIMJm&amp;dq=normotrophic%20scar%20healing&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q=normotrophic%20scar%20healing&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bioengineering In Wound Healing: A Systems Approach</a>,'</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These processes include coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, fibropalacia, epithelization, contraction, and remodeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wound healing is not always a linear process, as it depends on multiple local, system, and environmental characteristics. When the healed wound completely restores the anatomy and function of the initial tissue, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the regeneration is complete and scarless. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration are not favorable in mammals. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the wound must close fast to enable survival and thus, in most cases in mammals, a tick fibrous tissue — a scar — is formed at the injured site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although several systemic and genomic studies have identified potential cellular and extracellular factors that mediate the formation of scars, the exact mechanism that induces proliferative scar tissue formation instead of healthy tissue is unknown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current data show that alterations in coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, contraction, remodeling, mechanical tension correlate with the formation of scars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inflammation plays an important role in the body’s response to the injury and in all stages of wound healing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The inflammatory response includes the response of local inflammatory cells and recruitment of inflammatory cells from the circulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multiple studies show that inflammation continues to play a critical role in wound remodeling,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…probably leading to scar formation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wounds create damage at the system’s protective layer and provides a new, nutrient rich ground for microorganisms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microbiota play a role in both wound-healing abnormalities: chronic, non-healing wounds and hypertrophic scars, and also healing improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Advances in molecular biology have allowed for an improved understanding of wound healing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For optimal healing, complex molecular processes must be appropriate and precise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The depth of injury is of particular interest as it determines if a wound heals with scarring or not. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Injury that is restricted to the epidermis is referred to as an erosion; if the injury were to go deeper, involving the dermis, then it is referred to as an ulcer…Erosions heal without scar, while dermal injury often heals with scar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many factors influence the time needed for a wound to heal…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…by secondary intention: wound depth (i.e. deeper wounds take longer than shallow wounds), anatomic location (e.g. concave surfaces do better than convex surfaces), vascular supply, shape (I.e. the narrower the diameter, the faster the closure), underlying comorbidities (e.g. Diabetes, tobacco use), and secondary infection...the balance between degradation and synthesis determines if a scar will be normal or abnormal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your ""normotrophic"" scar type is said to cause the least harm and typically forms as a result of an adequate reaction of the body to an injury. A chapter on Normotrophic Scars in the ‘<a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-29196-8_3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Atlas of Scar Treatment and Correction</a>’ states the following,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the wound passes all stages of cicatrization without deviations, a normotrophic scar is formed. <strong>In time, such scars become level with the skin, assume a whitish color, become thin, and do not pose any physical discomfort to their bearers. Normally, they do not require correction except for aesthetic improvement of the scar appearance, its surface effacement, and acceleration of the color normalization process</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What vitamins (dietary supplements or some other substances) for internal taking will be useful for the skin?</strong> </p>

<p>There isn't one specific vitamin, supplement, or ""some other substance"" that is useful for the skin. However, your nutritional status in general can greatly influence wound healing, as wounds increase the energy, vitamin, mineral, and protein requirements necessary to promote healing. In fact, without adequate nutrition, the process of wound healing can actually be negatively impacted. </p>

<p>According to ‘<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27447105"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nutrition in Wound Care Management: A Comprehensive Overview.</a>’ </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The role of nutrition in wound healing may be overlooked in the wound care patient…it is often multifaceted, with many nutritional components playing a variety of roles in the wound healing process. <strong>Suboptimal nutrition can alter immune function, collagen synthesis, and wound tensile strength, all of which are essential in the wound healing process.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above abstract determined that <em>nutrition is a common denominator for all wound patients</em>, regardless of the type of wound. In summary,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…it appears that some nutrients are necessary only if deficient, whereas others may become conditionally essential and serve a therapeutic role. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nutrition also influences <em>skin structure</em>. An abstract titled ‘<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832138"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Effects of Dietary Macronutrient Balance on Skin Structure in Aging Male and Female Mice.</a>’ evaluated the associations between macronutrients, energy intake, and skin structure in mice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We evaluated the associations between macronutrients, energy intake and skin structure in mice fed 25 experimental diets and a control diet for 15 months using the Geometric Framework, a novel method of nutritional analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skin structure was associated with the <em>ratio of dietary macronutrients eaten</em> and the nature of the effect differed between the sexes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In males, skin structure was primarily associated with protein intake</strong>, whereas <strong>in females carbohydrate intake was the primary correlate</strong>. In both sexes, the dermis and subcutaneous fat thicknesses were inversely proportional. Subcutaneous fat thickness varied positively with fat intake, due to enlarged adipocytes rather than increased adipocyte number. We therefore demonstrated clear interactions between skin structure and macronutrient intakes, with the associations being sex-specific and dependent on dietary macronutrient balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An abstract on '<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217039/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nutrition and Chronic Wounds</a>' discusses nutrition as related to the patient with chronic wounds. The review provides knowledge of basic nutrition, the epidemiology of malnutrition in the chronic wound patient, and how to screen patients for malnutrition. It also recognizes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…even obese patients may suffer from protein and micronutrient malnutrition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Macronutrients are discussed in detail:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macronutrients are defined by ASPEN Guidelines and Standards as “<strong>nutrients present in the body and required in the greatest amount (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids).”</strong> Amino acids are the building blocks of protein throughout the body. Some individual amino acids (arginine, glutamine, and methionine) have been supplemented in addition to the protein in the diet as adjunct pharmacologic nutrients for wound healing. Carbohydrates may be used to provide carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis but only for those amino acids that are nutritionally dispensable (nonessential). Indispensible (essential) amino acids must be provided in the diet as a component of protein fed or as a keto-acid for all indispensible amino acids except lysine, threonine, and histidine. Fatty acids and cholesterol are nutrients that can be catabolized via beta oxidation to form cellular energy (ATP) and have important cellular functionality such as insulating membranes for nerve axons and are also necessary to form the lipid bilayer essential for organelle and cell membranes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Micronutrients are also discussed in detail:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Micronutrients are defined as “nutrients present and required in the body in minute quantities (e.g., vitamins, trace elements).”</strong> Micronutrients include the vitamins and certain minerals. These minerals are often referred to as trace elements. Certain minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus (macrominerals), which are present in large quantities in the bone and other tissues, are not considered trace elements. One of the most common functions of micronutrients, and some macrominerals, is to serve as necessary cofactors for enzymatic reactions. Essential (or indispensable) nutrients are those that cannot be synthesized in the body, such as vitamin C and minerals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>'<a href=""https://mynutrition.wsu.edu/nutrition-basics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nutrition Basics</a>' by Washington State University, outlines specifics related to macro- and micronutrients including role in the body, recommended daily allowance, and food sources. This might be a useful resource in determining appropriate macro- and micronutrient related food choices that may promote wound healing and possibly reduce the appearance of scarring.</p>

<p>Additionally, '<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12070399/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The importance of patients’ nutritional status in wound healing</a>,' concurs,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wound healing is dependent on good nutrition and the presence of suitable polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet.</strong> Protein deficiency has been demonstrated to contribute to poor healing rates with reduced collagen formation and wound dehiscence. High exudate loss can result in a deficit of as much as 100g of protein in one day. This subsequently needs to be replaced with a <strong>high protein diet</strong>. <strong>Vitamins are also important in wound healing</strong>. Vitamin C deficiency contributes to fragile granulation tissue. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it is possible that you may not achieve complete scar prevention, the information described above may provide some insight about the role of nutrition in wound healing and scar appearance. Because your injury is located on your face, it is also important to be conscious of simple facial movements, as this may also affect the healing process and contribute to scar formation. However, as with any health-related question or concern, it is always best to consult with your primary care physician or treatment specialist before making any drastic changes to your normal dietary regimen.</p>

"When doing static (traditional ""lean and hold"" type of stretching), how long should we hold the stretch?","69","","<p>I was doing some muscle stretching after my daily run (the idea is to stretch to have flexible muscles) and it got me to think: is there a minimum amount of time required for the stretch to be effective? Is there a maximum time, in which past that limit we risk inducing injuries?</p>
","<p>The general consensus on the internet and among various physical trainers is that static stretching in 20-30 second segments is sufficient to increase range of motion (ROM) in a muscle. This is corroborated by two studies (Very similar in nature, conducted by the same people), where <a href=""http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/77/10/1090.short"" rel=""nofollow"">one study</a> showed that there was no difference when time was increased from 30 to 60 seconds and performed multiple times per day, and <a href=""http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/74/9/845.short"" rel=""nofollow"">another that showed</a> no gains when solely increasing from 30-60 seconds per stretch.</p>

<p>However, if your goal is to increase flexibility, then you may want to also look at adding proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) type stretching once or twice a week. The most basic form of this is to get into a stretch, and then isometrically contract (joint/muscle stay static, rather than moving) against the stretch. This is, however, an advanced stretching technique and should only be done after proper instruction. <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2011/11000/The_Acute_Effects_of_Different_Stretching.8.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">This study</a> showed that PNF stretching also was the only one that produced performance enhancement.</p>

<p>Ballistic stretching (lean and bounce) type stretching has been much maligned, and is still contraindicated because of the tendency towards producing injury. (It tends to activate the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch_reflex"" rel=""nofollow"">stretch reflex</a> in muscles and produce tears/strains). However, <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2006/11000/Ballistic_Stretching_Increases_Flexibility_and.12.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">there is some indication</a> that it may aid in jumping type performances.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>Dynamic stretching before workouts (active movement that mimics the motions of the sport), and static stretching after (30 seconds, and I personally do a stretch and hold, relax, repeat even deeper type of cycle for each muscle) produce some of your best gains for the typical everyday person. PNF can get even greater gains if needed. However, it has not been proven yet (Despite claims) that any type of stretching produces better injury prevention or reduces muscle soreness after workouts. Also, static stretching before performance has been shown to negatively impact performance.</p>

","<p>It is difficult to know if your friend will experience adverse health affects associated with shift work, as everyone has different levels of tolerance for the effects of shift work.

<li><strong>Mental Health</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>There have been reports of increased anxiety and depression among shift workers.  The question of whether shift work <strong>causes</strong> increased psychiatric morbidity however is still an open question, as correlation doesn't always imply causation.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Cardiovascular Disorders</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Scandinavian studies show that shift workers have a 40% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including angina, hypertension and myocardial infarction.  It is thought this increase risk may be associated with disturbances in the circadian rhythm, increased stress, poor diet and lack of exercise.  </p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong>Reproductive Disorders</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>There is increasing evidence that shift work may lead to increased risk of spontaneous abortion, low birth weight and prematurity.</p>

<p>The risks of developing any of these adverse health affects from shift work may also depend on age, sex and personality.  Evidence shows older people are able to tolerate shift work less than younger people.</p>

It seems to be getting worse with age (I'm now 35), but doesn't disrupt my life in any significant way, but I am eager to see if there's a treatment, particularly living in Abu Dhabi, where everyone lives on floors 5 and above!</p>

<p><strong>Are there any physical treatments that have been shown to be effective to treat acrophobia?</strong>  I want to avoid just masking the problem (anti-anxiety drugs, etc.).</p>
","<p><em>Behavioral therapy</em> works well. Behavioral therapists initially focus on teaching what anxiety is, helping the client to identify anxiety responses, teaching relaxation techniques, setting goals, discussing methods to achieve those goals, and helping the client to visualize phobic situations.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One behavioral therapy often used to treat phobias is <strong>systematic
  (serial) desensitization</strong>, in which the therapist progressively exposes
  the client to the threatening object in a safe setting until the
  client’s anxiety decreases. During each exposure, the complexity and
  intensity of exposure gradually increase, but the client’s anxiety
  decreases. The reduced anxiety serves as a positive reinforcement
  until the anxiety is ultimately eliminated. - <em>Videbeck Psychiatric
  Mental health Nursing 5th edition</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other behavorial therapy that can be used is <strong><a href=""http://www.simplypsychology.org/behavioral-therapy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Flooding</a></strong> (<strong>implosion therapy</strong>). It works by exposing the patient directly to their worst fears. For example, standing in a glass room in a height of 1000 feet or letting a person to be submerge in a pool for hydrophobic patients. At first the person would experience extreme panic, but later on their anxiety will subside because they have no choice but to confront their fears until they'll realize that it will do them no harm.  </p>

<p>However, <em>flooding</em> is rarely used because it can be dangerous if the therapist is not careful. The patient may experience extreme panic that can further lead to seizure, paralysis, or even death. </p>

<p>I, too, an acrophobic and having a hard time to get over with this fear even though I am a nurse and I know how to treat it. In your case, you can use the <strong>desensitization</strong> method and expose yourself in extreme heights gradually, but I advised you to have someone or a psychologist or psychiatrist with you to assist you when something goes wrong. </p>

"Take and analyse blood samples at home","68","","<p>Is there a method/device for a person to analyze the basic characteristics of her blood without going to the doctor?</p>

<p>Background motivation: A patient has reoccurring symptoms that appear at random times. So far they were never present when the blood was taken and analyzed in the hospital and the blood tests showed nothing wrong. The idea is to have the patient take and analyze her blood samples while the symptoms are showing and present those to the doctor to aid diagnoses.</p>
","<p>Probably not. </p>

<p>Few things that people can check by just looking at their own blood under the microscope, if they take some time to learn the skill. Counting red and white blood cells, for example. But without a lot of practice, those numbers could be very wrong. Also, you probably won't be able to differentiate between the types of white blood cells.  </p>

<p>There are also some things that can be done using tests that you can buy at a pharmacy (and maybe even a supermarket), for example blood sugar. These are usually very easy to use so people can use them at home. When in doubt, ask a pharmacist or doctor. </p>

<p>Some bacteria can be stained and identified with equipment that can be purchased from specialised businesses. Again, this takes practice. It's easy to get something wrong. </p>

<p>And unless we are talking about diabetes or leukemia, both of which would also show up when being tested at a doctor's office, these tests are not helpful in your scenario. Almost all other medical tests, like testing antibodies, hormones, vitamins, CRP, need specialized lab equipment and people with training. </p>

<p>There would be the possibility of taking blood and having it analyzed later. But while <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22823600"" rel=""nofollow"">blood can be stored in a cold environment and analyzed later</a> (most doctor's offices I know only deliver to a lab once a day, storing the blood in a fridge before that), most people aren't trained at taking whole vials of blood,  and even people who are don't usually take their own blood. </p>

<p>The patient's best bet in this scenario is to have some doctor take the blood while the symptoms are occurring and send the sample to the lab. Doesn't necessarily have to be the treating specialist - one of mine is 70 kilometers away, so I have my blood tests done by my GP I can walk to. </p>

<p>As a bit of an aside, I have a hard time coming up with anything that would show up in the blood sample while showing symptoms, but fail to show up in one taken a few hours later after symptoms subside. Then again, I am not a doctor.</p>

"Weight increase after quitting smoking","68","","<p>In clinical setting, weight gain after quitting smoking is a complain that many patients have.</p>

<p>Which evidence do we have and what's the reccomended approach to treat this condition?</p>
","<p><em>The literature regarding smoking cessation and weight gain is abundant and probably I won’t be able to go through all the points in my post.</em></p>

<p>Some years ago, a paper published in Obesity Reviews by Fizolof et al (Obes Rev. 2004 May;5(2):95-103) provided a excellent overview on the topic. 
As it is not open access, here are some interesting extracts which should bring some clarifications</p>

<p>First, regarding the evidence for weight gain smoking cessation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whereas numerous studies have found evidence that smoking cessation is
  associated with weight gain, there is controversy regarding the
  consistency and magnitude of this weight gain.</strong> Although most
  will gain less than 4.5 kg, as many as 13% of quitters may gain at
  least 11 kg. African Americans, people under the age of 55 and
  heavy smokers (those smoking more than 25 cigarettes per day) are at
  elevated risk for major weight gain. Besides, low
  socio-economic status was also associated to higher weight gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, studies often showed some <strong>methodological limitations</strong> such as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the use of self-reported height and weight, failure to biochemically
  validate smoking status, a tendency to report point prevalence vs.
  continuous abstinence and limited follow-up periods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What are the possible mechanisms associated with weight gain?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mechanism of weight gain include increased energy intake,
  decreased resting metabolic rate, decreased physical activ- ity, and
  changes in adipose tissue-lipoprotein lipase (AT-LPL) activity and
  lipolysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no clear evidence based recommendations to avoid weight gain after smoking (probably due to the lack of a clear consensus regarding weight gain and smoking cessation).</p>

<p>Filozof reviewed some studies which investigated either pharmacological or behavioural/diet interventions in smoking cessation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Nicotine replacement – in particular nicotine gum</strong> – appears to be
  effective in delaying post-cessation weight gain (1). However, once
  nicotine gum use ceases, the quitting smoker gains an amount of weight
  that is about the same as if she or he had never used gum (1).</p>
  
  <p><strong>1 mg of nicotine (contained in a chewing gum)</strong> has a pronounced
  thermogenic effect that could be increased by 100% by adding 100 mg
  caffeine (2).</p>
  
  <p>Assali et al. reported no prevention of weight gain by <strong>transdermal
  nicotine replacement patch</strong> (3)</p>
  
  <p>Compared with placebo, mean body weight gain at the end of treatment
  was significantly lower in patients receiving short-term <strong>bupropion</strong>
  300 mg d-1 who had been continuously abstinent (4), long-term
  bupropion (5) or bupropion plus nicotine patch (5)</p>
  
  <p>Danielsson et al. (5) reported higher rates of success for smoking
  cessation by combining the smoking cessation programme with an <strong>intervention diet.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Some studies (7,8) reported that <strong>exercise</strong> might minimize weight gain
  after smoking cessation.</p>

<p>If your friend had no illicit drug use before the drug test, there will not be a false positive result (paper doesn't contain drugs.)</p>

<p><em>False positives</em> are a valid concern, therefore there is much attention paid to such results. Further tests are usually done on positive urine samples to insure that they're true positives, such as gas chromatography, etc. </p>

<p>Some bad bacteria (anaerobic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis) may live in the gap, as I read from a dentist's article.</p>

<p>However, most famous dental implants are still two-piece system, although I found that many small manufacturers produce one-piece system.</p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of one-piece system? Are there any guidelines for helping patients decide between one-piece and two-piece implants?</p>
","<p>The simplest answer is that <strong>both types of systems are more or less equal</strong>.</p>

<p>Long answer:
It's actually the dentist that needs to be aware of a few concepts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The angle of the bone in which the implant is placed relative to the position of the crown that will be on top of it. they are not always in line. The ideal scenario is second from left, while the worst one is 3rd from the left. Nobody wants a screw to show up in the front of the crown! To remedy this problem it is possible to use the second stage in a 2-piece system to reangulate the crown.

<li><p>Amount of gingival tissue between the bone and the mouth. If the gingiva isn't very thick, it might be advantageous to remove the intermediate step, so that as little as possible metal shows through the gingiva.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability of the bone to endure immediate loading of the implant. If both the implant and the platform come in one piece, the implant will be exposed to forces in the mouth immediately after being placed, while the two piece option permits us to temporarily bury and avoid putting immediate stress on the implant, thereby enabling it to better integrate the bone, especially if the later is of poor quality. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>To address your concern about a micro crack appearing between the two pieces, it is most often due to the insufficient tightening of the screw</strong>. At least 15-25 Newtons need to be applied, using an implant screw, to sufficiently tighten the the pieces to avoid the appearance of a micro crack and further of the screw.</p></li>

<p>Are there any other major side effects of putting my laptop on my lap while using it?</p>
","<p>The main energy emissions (i.e. ways of affecting its surroundings) of a laptop computer are—</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sound</strong>: Unless your laptop has extravagant bass speakers that can physically rattle your organs hard enough to be painful, this will have no effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heat</strong>: A laptop can run quite hot, and <a href=""http://malecontraceptives.org/methods/heat_biology.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heating the testes can be used as a method of contraception</a>, as the ideal temperature for sperm to survive is a little lower than your body temperature otherwise.  The effect is not permanent—heat strong enough to cause lasting damage would be physically painful.</p>

<p>However, I think the effect of a laptop on the user's testes is likely to be negligible.  A usual sitting position puts lots of room between the testes and the laptop, allowing most of the heat to dissipate (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inverse-square law</a>).  If you are trying to conceive, and your laptop runs very hot, and you use it in your lap for a large part of your waking hours, <em>then</em> its positioning may be worth considering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Radio waves</strong>: Computers use low-power non-ionising radiation for WiFi communication channels.  Such radiation has <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1178/are-wifi-waves-harmful"">not been shown to damage human tissue in any way</a>.</p>

<p>I see no way a laptop could cause skin discoloration, except unless ⓐ the skin was burned because the laptop was hot, or ⓑ if the skin's blood supply was cut off due to long-lasting pressure from a very heavy laptop in the same position.</p>

<p>Once these malignant cells are in the circulation, they have to repeat the above mentioned steps at a remote site. Additionally, in order to survive in a foreign tissue, they need to find a ""hospitable niche"", where they must avoid detection by host defences and warrant blood supply by inducing the growth of new blood vessels. </p>

<p>As you see, the metastatic process is complex and depends on several factors. The rate-limiting step in the metastatic process is the ability for tumor cells to survive and expand in a novel microenvironment. Not all cells have this faculty (so called “metastatic phenotype”) and current evidence suggest that probably only small fraction of tumor cells have this capacity. </p>

<p>Studies have shown that chemokine receptors play a role in the metastatic capacity of a malignant cell. Also, recently, some candidate metastasis-suppressor genes, whose loss of function was associated with metastasis have been identified. Further studies are ongoing in order to understand the genetic and molecular pathways underlying the metastatic process.</p>

<p>So as suggested in one of the comment, the metastic process (and therefore spreading areas) in lung cancer (but also in other type of cancer) is dependent on the malignant cells and on their genotype/phenotype.</p>

<p>I was wondering, considering I have bronchitis at the moment could that further the illness in any way? </p>
","<p>If you look at the factors that cause an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"">acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</a> (such as bronchitis), you will find that</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The cause can not be identified in one third of the cases. In the ones with identifiable causes, they may be</p></li>
<li><p>Respiratory infections (bacterial and viral)</p></li>
<li><p>Allergy</p></li>
<li><p>Toxins</p></li>
<li><p>Non adherenace to medications. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>When I read through the technique you were talking about, I found that there is no such risk factors in that technique. However, you should take the following precautions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Avoid this exercise when you have an active acute exacerbation of the disease. Fast breathing causes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_resistance"">airways to collapse</a> by Bernoulli's principle, and hence you will have more difficulty breathing. Even though it can potentially clear your airway, it is better avoided at that times.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that you sit in a place with clean air when you do this exercise. You don't want allergens, toxins or even pathogens in the air entering your lungs when you are breathing like that.</p></li>
<li><p>No cold exposure. Cold exposure can trigger a vasovagal attack and can cause constriction of airways. This can even precipitate an acute attack. So a big no no to that. </p></li>
<li><p>Even though it is a no brainer, it is important that you monitor yourself all the time. If you feel not so good, stop immediately. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other than that, it is generally considered a safe practice to do breathing exercises, and are sometimes adviced to patients of bronchitis. If you follow these precautions, you should be fine. </p>

","<p>The T-spot blood test for tuberculosis is an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA or  IFN-γ assay). There are two of these tests (Quantiferon and T-spot) with small differences, but <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing/igra.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">the basic mechanism</a> is the same and they are treated the same for the CDC, <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">which writes</a>:</p>

"Resistance of Bacteria to Antibiotics after fall-back","66","","<p>If an infection comes back a few weeks after taking antibiotics, because the full dose and prescribed amount of antibiotics wasn't taken, does this mean that the bacteria is now immune to that antibiotic? Or can it still be treated the same way?</p>
","<p>First of all, nothing is immune to anything, just resistant, and resisitance itself varies. If you develop a bacterial or viral disease, your body will develop antibodies against it. This makes you resistant to the bacteria or virus, but not immune. If you are exposed to a sufficient quantity of that same agent, you will develop the disease again. This is true for antibiotic-resistance, as well.<br><br>So...when you take antibiotics for some bacterial disease, some small percentage of those bacteria may be naturally resistant to the bacterium simply because of genetic mutation, may have developed strategies that allow it to mutate in response to environmental stimuli, or have borrowed it from cross-breeding<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4888801/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><sup>1</sup></a>. When you start taking the antibiotic, it kills off the non-resistant bacterial population first, which is generally the vast majority if it. Normally, you are prescribed a sufficient amount of antibiotic to kill off the whole bacterial population. The problem arises when people stop the antibiotic regimen because they're feeling fine and see no reason for taking the remaining prescription. This leaves behind the resistant bacteria. And if your immune system doesn't take care of the rest, you will redevelop the disease, and it will then be resistant the that antibiotic. Not only that, but you will then spread that antibiotic-resistant bacteria to others.<br><br>Depending on the strength of the bacteria's resistance the disease may nor may not need to be treated with a different antibiotic, but most likely it will. If treated with the same antibiotic, the dosage and/or duration will need to be increased.<br><br>Here's a <a href=""http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/05/superbug"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decent article</a>.<br><br>Note: by mentioning viruses I do not mean to imply that antibiotics may be used to treat viral infections.

<li>What is done to diagnose someone with venous leak?</li>
<li>Are there effective treatments, such as surgery?</li>
<li>At what stage surgery is needed?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I will answer your questions in turn</p>

<h2>How does venous leak develop?</h2>

<p>WebMD <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/guide/vascular-disease-ed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in the linked article in your question</a> states how Venous Leak can happen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It may happen with <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/vascular-disease#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vascular disease</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vascular diseases affect blood vessels. They lower blood flow to organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. If they cut blood flow to the penis, they can cause erectile dysfunction. These diseases may be the cause of ED in as many as 50% to 70% of men who have it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s also linked to diabetes, Peyronie's disease (a buildup of scar tissue in the penis that leads to curved, painful erections), some nerve conditions, and even severe anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is done to diagnose someone with venous leak?</h2>

<p>For medical diagnosis, <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/guide/diagnosing-erectile-dysfunction#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebMD states</a> that as well as your medical and sexual history, your doctor will check your penis and testicles to make sure they look normal and their nerves work as expected. He may also look for hair loss and larger-than-normal breasts. Both of these can be signs that you have a hormone problem.</p>

<p>He may also check your pulse at your wrists and ankles to see whether your blood flow is normal,listen to your heartbeat to make sure it sounds right, and take your blood pressure.</p>

<p>Based on your physical exam, as well as looking at your medical and sexual history, your doctor may want to order certain blood or urine tests, or even an overnight erection test.</p>

<p>If it looks more likely that a mental or emotional issue is the source of the problem, your doctor will ask you standard questions about your mental well-being. They help him/her check for depression, anxiety, and other common causes of erectile dysfunction.</p>

<h2>Are there effective treatments, such as surgery?</h2>

<p>WebMD <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/guide/erectile-dysfunction-treatment#1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at this page</a> gives a list of possible treatments depending on the results of the medical examination, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Counselling</strong> - for depression or anxiety related problems</li>
<li><strong>Medications</strong> - Tadalafil, Sildenafil etc.</li>
<li><strong>Pumps</strong> - vacuum devices</li>
<li><strong>Surgery</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>At what stage surgery is needed?</h2>

<p>This as a last resort (if all else fails).  These can include placement of an implant (prosthesis) in the penis or vascular reconstruction surgery to improve blood flow to or reduce blood leakage from the penis and surrounding structures. This procedure works in very few cases.</p>

"How many different dialects of sign-language are there? And braille for the blind? Is it a different system for each language?","65","","<p>I know that there are several versions of sign languages out there for the deaf, hearing-impaired, and mute individuals (like we have American Sign Language -- ASL:, which must mean we have other dialects of English Sign language, correct?), but <strong>how many languages of sign language do we actually have?</strong> I understand the need to have different signs for different letters in different languages that don't use the same alphabet so that spellings can be different for their respective native tongue, but... <strong>is there an entire new system of sign language for each language?</strong> </p>

<p>I know nothing about braille, but was <strong>wondering how many different forms of braille there are?</strong> Since it's reading letters... I imagine it would have a different system for each alphabet system, right? Or is it more complicated than that? </p>

<p>Please do enlighten me on this. I do feel very ignorant because even though I was born hearing-impaired and wore hearing aids my entire life and gone through speech therapy and had an interest in sign language... I never learned it. </p>
","<p>This question sounds more appropriate for the Linguistics SE. I'll answer it here anyhow.</p>

<p>ASL is based on French Sign Language, the first sign language teacher came from France. AFAIK, the Franch sign language formed spontaneously as soon as there were cities and communities of deaf children. When there is no sign language, but other people who are deaf, the children will spontaneously begin to sign and create a new language. Abroad, many countries got their first language from teacher from the US, so for example Philippine's Sign Language is based on ASL. </p>

<p>These languages have almost no relationship to the speaking communities language. ASL's grammar is more similar to Chinese than to English. But what about fingerspell? Yes, that is one way that English can be encode with your hands. Attempting to write English with your hands is mind-numbingly slow. To communicate at a normal rate, you have to use strategies that prevent 1:1 compatibility with English. This doesn't stop well wishing amateurs from suggesting some sort of ""manual English"", SEE (Signed Exact English) is one current contender for a ""English-fied"" sign language.</p>

<p>Regarding dialects of ASL, there are a certain number of Deaf schools. Community differences in signing vary by which school you attended. One famous example is the many regionally different ways to sign Pizza in ASL.</p>

<p>Braille on the otherhand is <em>English</em>. The blind can hear and speak English just fine. So their community is the English speaking community &amp; can read it just fine. For the Deaf community, where ASL is their first language, often they don't learn English as well. This creates a massive cultural war between those who want to force English on the Deaf (at the expense of ASL) and those who favor bilingualism. AFAIK, no one is advocating ASL-only, the Deaf need to deal with the hearing community all the time and it's uncontroversially valuable to be able to understand English, the more fluent the better.</p>

<p>It is. Your brain constantly grows until you are 25.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to recent findings, the human brain does not reach full maturity until at least the mid-20s. (See J. Giedd in References.) [...] <sup><a href=""http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/brain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup>

<p><strong>2) If so, what negative effect, if any, will having a single beer 3-4 nights out of the week have on my brain development and my health? Will I have to suffer the consequences of these decisions as I continue through adulthood?</strong></p>

<p>I can't cite an exact study right now as I haven't found one but several sites hint that there shouldn't be a problem if alcohol is taken in moderately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you choose to drink alcohol, do so only in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger. [...] <sup><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551?pg=1"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I found a study trying to unveil the links between alcohol consumption and its effects and the age in which drinking starts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First use of alcohol at ages 11–14 greatly heightens the risk of progression to the development of alcohol disorders and therefore is a reasonable target for intervention strategies that seek to delay first use as a means of averting problems later in life. <sup><a href=""http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.745"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you age, the probability of developing an alcohol addiction shrinks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] Ten years after their first drink 13.5% (49 of 363) of the respondents ages 11 and 12 and 13.7% (155 of 1,129) of the respondents ages 13 and 14 had progressed to a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, compared to just 2.0% in the reference group (19 and older) [...] <sup><a href=""http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.745"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an excerpt of a study I didn't have access to. The study, however, seems to represent some relevant data if you can access it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] Discouraging alcohol consumption until neurobiological adulthood is reached is important for minimizing alcohol-related disruptions in brain development and decision-making capacity, and for reducing the negative behavioral consequences associated with underage alcohol use. <sup><a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10673229.2012.714642"" rel=""nofollow"">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Finally, I found a PDF concluding a lot of relevant data <sup><a href=""http://www.talkitoutnc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AdolescentBrainStudyFINAL-PRINT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">6</a></sup>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adolescent alcohol use sets up a persistent increase in activation of brain signals that contribute to inflammation. The consequences of this are unclear, but similar changes have been associated with depression in adults, and suggest that early alcohol use may set kids up for mood problems in adulthood. <sup><a href=""http://www.talkitoutnc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AdolescentBrainStudyFINAL-PRINT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The PDF should give a good insight about the topic. It concludes several other things aswell. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find an exact study to meet your requirements. But I guess I could say that drinking in moderation is okay, but it's always better to stop it completely <sup><a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/quit-drinking-alcohol-for-a-month#1"" rel=""nofollow"">7</a></sup>.</p>

"I'm afraid of going to dentist","65","","<p>I've a cavity in a tooth. It's very small but it seems that it's deep because I feel pain when I eat sugar on this tooth or when I do much stress for chewing.</p>

<p>I've heard that refilling a cavity is a painful process. That's why I don't wanna go to a doctor. I'll brush my teeth regularly and increase calcium intake trying to prevent more damage.. Will this work? </p>

<p>For me, it's better to remove the entire tooth (if it becomes too bad) than refilling it because that's less painful. Am I making the right decision?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,</p>
","<p>When you go to the dentist the first thing she will do is not to fix that cavity, but an inspection of your teeth. This will give you a chance to meet and talk to the dentist before anything gets serious and you can ask all the questions you want. </p>

<p>The truth about the pain is, filling cavities used to be extremely painful in the long gone days before anaesthetics were invented. These days you get a jab, the part of your mouth with the sick tooth will go numb and you will not feel a thing during the treatment. Even after the anaesthetic wears off there won't be any pain as there is only pain during the cleaning of the cavity but it stops right after the tools are removed from the tooth, this is where teeth are different to flesh wounds. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if you wait too long you will be in for a lot of pain. From your description I would think that your teeth are overall rather healthy. A healthy tooth can be very sensitive even with a small hole that is not very deep. This means there is a lot of potential for the pain to become worse. At some point it will become permanent. This can happen suddenly. You may wake up in the middle of the night and will be in pure pain, as if you had a glowing hot iron in your mouth and you can't get rid of it. Also there will be no one close by to give you any real help (like a dentist could). </p>

<p>So, if you think going to the dentist is scary, not going is a lot scarier.</p>

<p>How do I know all this? From experience. From my mothers side I inherited teeth that are prone to cavities so I had regular treatments starting with my milk teeth. The only dentist in the area believed in treating children <em>without anaesthetics</em> so they would remember the pain and look better after their teeth. This was forty years ago and any dentist with this kind of attitude today would not have their license for very long (or so I hope). This left me scared of dentists too and as an adult I didn't go for a couple of years, until one of my teeth became so sore as I described above. The pain was a lot worse than getting treated even without anaesthetics and there was no end to it. </p>

<p>Today I am more scared of <em>not</em> going. Because of the condition of my teeth there was a time where I have been more frequently to the dentist than to the hairdresser and these days, having been to <em>sane</em> dentists ever since, I am not scared of going at all. </p>

"Is a general vaccine against getting a cold possible?","65","","<p>While the common cold is a broad disease, is it possible to get vaccinated? Is it possible at least in some future, or is it even in theory not possible? </p>
","<p>The problem with treating ""the common cold"" is that it's really a large collection of similar illnesses caused by completely different strains of virus. The effects are similar, but the causes are different. Any treatment for one type would likely be ineffective against many of the others.</p>

<p>Here are some stats from <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/cure-for-common-cold-vaccine-2016-10"" rel=""noreferrer"">a Business Insider article</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>A ""cold"" can be caused by over 200 different viruses.</li>
<li>20-30 types of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>rhinovirus</em></a> - the most common class of culprit - can be in a given area in a certain period.</li>
<li>It's likely that a different set of viruses will be in that area the next year, meaning people would need to be vaccinated annually, at the least.</li>
<li>It's impossible to predict what strains will pop up next.</li>
</ul>

<p>To have a completely effective vaccine, you'd need to have as many strains as possible in either a single vaccine or a series of them, and that's simply not easy. It could be impossible.</p>

<p>That said, there are ongoing efforts, as always. A couple different paths have been taken; I've given an example for each.</p>

<h2>The brute force approach</h2>

<p>One technique is to simply stuff as many strains into a vaccine as possible. An attempt I've seen mentioned quite a lot is <a href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12838"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Lee et al. (2016)</strong></a>. They tested a vaccine on macaques (monkeys, not too different from humans) and found that certain antibodies were produced in response to types of human rhinovirus. They attempted to use 50 strains at once in the vaccine, which is quite impressive, and got good results for 49 out of those 50.</p>

<h2>The alarm approach<sup>1</sup></h2>

<p>There have also been other attempts in recent years. <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/WO2014122220A1?cl=en"" rel=""noreferrer"">One group</a> went on a different path, using a specific protein found when viruses invade cells as a vaccination in mice. This has the advantage that it can be used to train the immune system against many different strains; one protein can serve as a vaccine against dozens of types of viruses.</p>

<h2>The cell sacrifice approach</h2>

<p>A few years back, a group at MIT (<a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022572"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Rider et al. (2011)</strong></a>) developed a technique called Double-stranded RNA [dsRNA] Activated Caspase
Oligomerizer (DRACO). DRACO essentially gets infected cells to shut themselves down - killing themselves - to stop the infection from spreading. After all, viruses need cells to reproduce. So far, DRACO has worked in mice, defeating over a dozen types of viruses.</p>

<hr>

<p>All of these approaches need testing! Human subjects have not yet been used; the closest any have gotten have been macaques, as well as isolated human cells. Additionally, no treatment has been tested against more than a fraction of rhinoviruses and other strains. There's absolutely no guarantee that any of this will work, but it's certainly steps in the right direction.</p>

<hr>

"Is it healthier for the children to have the heater on or off during the night?","65","","<p>A friend of mine claims that children should never have the heater on during the night because it helps viruses and bacteria to grow.</p>

<p>An other person claims the opposite and the child should never feel cold.</p>
","<h3>Cold is good for slowing pathogens, but not the cold we like</h3>

<p>Bacterial growth isn't going to be sufficiently slowed at temperatures that humans are comfortable with. One of the reasons the bacteria that infect us are still around causing us problems today is because they like a lot of the same conditions we do! Many infectious bacteria are <em>mesophilic</em>, meaning they like temperatures between 20C and 40C - the human body is normally at 37C.<sup><a href=""http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3409800375.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup></p>

<h3>Other reasons not to keep it too cold</h3>

<p>A problem with cold temperatures is that the child may have a harder time breathing due to bronchospasm - a condition where the airways become narrower - and cold dry air causing irritation.<sup><a href=""http://www.circumpolarhealthjournal.net/index.php/ijch/article/download/18237/20930"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></sup> Colder air can also cause the shell on the influenza virus to harden, making it more infectious<sup><a href=""http://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-scientists-offer-explanation-winter-flu-season"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Don't forget about humidity</h3>

<p>Another consideration that you didn't mention is relative humidity. Both heaters and air conditioners can change our body's ability to dissipate moisture. When the moisture evaporates too fast, we can have irritation to our skin, nose, and throat.<sup><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/women/home-health-and-safety-9/dry-indoor-air"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a></sup> </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It's probably best to keep the temperature and humidity at a level where the child is comfortable sleeping, within reason.</p>

"Mitigating / Stopping hiccups","65","","<p>Hiccups can be annoying. I've heard about ways to stop them including breath holding, drinking warm water, and breathing really quickly, but these don’t seem to be consistently effective.  <strong>What sorts of interventions can be helpful for mitigating or even stopping hiccups?</strong></p>
","<p>I summarized the mechanism of hiccups in <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/21865/9268"">a question on biology.SE</a> a few months ago. That may be useful background information for the answer to this question about what interventions work.</p>

<p>Regarding the available data, as usual a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=23440833"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cochrane Review</a> provides the best meta-analysis, and as usual they conclude that there is insufficient evidence for anything. However, in practicality there are <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=8947969"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decent</a> observational <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=2024799"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">data</a> available.</p>

<p>Because hiccups stem from a reflex arc involving the vagal nerve, physical maneuvers that stimulate the vagus often abort hiccups.</p>

<p>These may include:   </p>

<ul>
<li>Breath holding</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6565684"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Valsalva maneuver</a> (exhaling against a closed glottis)</li>
<li>Stimulating the nasopharynx or glottis (e.g. gargling cold water; upside down is often (reasonably) recommended to route water up into the nasopharynx where is is more likely to cause vagal stimulation)</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of these is successful, medications are occasionally used. The oldest and most well-established treatment is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=13221413"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chlorpromazine</a> (a.k.a. Thorazine), a first-generation antipsychotic. Although it is approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of hiccups, even that has only been studied in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=13221413"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">small case series</a>, mostly in patients with hiccups due to cancer. Other medications that are sometimes used off-label include <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=25069531"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metoclopramide</a> (a.k.a. Reglan) and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=7758557"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">baclofen</a>. Although the studies of these medications are small, they do appear to be effective.</p>

<p>Most often, hiccups are benign, often triggered by gastric distention from over-eating or carbonated beverages. However, particularly intractable hiccups have been associated with serious conditions including intracranial problems such as stroke or encephalitis as well as many different kinds of cancer. If hiccups are occurring very frequently or are difficult to resolve, you should consult with a doctor. </p>

"Calculating HRV from heart rate","64","","<p>I don't have ECG graphs and R-R peaks. I need to calculate the HRV(heart rate variability). Is it possible from the heart rate alone?</p>
","<p>Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. The heart rate (HR) is the number of heart beats in some unit time (generally expressed as the number of beats per minute). In general, because measures of HR are an average over time, it will smooth out the variability in the heart rate. The amount of HRV cannot be estimated from a measure of the HR at a single time point. Estimating the amount of HRV from multiple measures of HR at different times is possible, but will be corrupted by changes in the average heart rate over time. So in summary, no HRV cannot be estimated from measures of HR.</p>

"Differences between MD vs DO regarding computational research?","64","","<p>I'm nearing graduation from university, at which point I'll have a degree in computer science (bioinformatics) with a minor in mathematics. My intention is to specialize in computational medical research, perhaps applying various A.I. techniques to studying/modeling medical data.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>is there an inherent difference between MD vs. DO regarding the ability to perform research?</strong> Are there more resources available for one more than the other? Does the industry, in general, promote/value research of DO more than MD? Other way around?</p>

<p>Any insight is greatly appreciated, as I need to start thinking about MCAT and applying to programs. </p>
","<p>MDs and DOs are both physicians.  Both learn at least a core medical curriculum, then take exams demonstrating that level of knowledge (USMLE vs COMLEX). Both can apply for residencies for any specialty, and they take the exact same specialty boards in order to practice medicine.  Both can go into research or any other branch of medical science, with or without going through a residency.</p>

<p>The core medical curriculum is offered in all.  So I honestly feel that what you learn and your exposure to research is highly institution-dependent, and the differences between MD schools can even be greater than between MD and DO schools. (Except that <a href=""http://medschool.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=1158&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=1019"" rel=""noreferrer"">OMT</a> is not offered in most MD schools to my knowledge.)  There are some generalizations, like that DO schools tend to be more holistic in philosophy, but even that is institution-dependent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, historically, and even still in some circumstances/regions/fields, DOs have had a more uphill battle to reach the positions and recognition that they deserve in this MD-dominated medical field.  But within the medical field, I feel that the vast majority of MDs and DOs today finally see each other as equal colleagues, as they should.  </p>

<p><em>Certainly</em> a doctor's skill as a clinician or researcher is more dependent on their individual learning, mentorship and experiences that they seek out than anything else!</p>

<p>Which is probably the most important factor for someone going into research: what the affiliated UNIVERSITY is doing.  What research can you be involved in during medical school? What can it offer you in strength of opportunities and mentorship? </p>

<p>I would approach it by exploring the difference between SCHOOLS rather than degrees. Figure out who is doing what you want to do, and who offers the most opportunity to explore what you're interested in.  Then apply accordingly.  Also, I recommend contacting both an MD and a DO in a similar field of research and ask them for their perspective on their experience, and advice as someone coming into the field.</p>

<p>No you are not reading it right, but your mistake is very a common misunderstanding of statistics.  </p>

<p>The key point to remember is: correlation does not imply causation. </p>

<p>That means that just because two things appear to coincide, you can't conclude that one causes the other - or even that they are related at all.</p>

<p>This is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cross-sectional study</a>.  They are looking at these variables at a single point in time.  This kind of study allows you to say ""interesting, many people who own red cars have cats."" Correlation. But what it doesn't do is allow any inference of which causes the other - you can't say that people who have cats are likely to get red cars, or the other way around.  </p>

<p>To attempt to establish causation, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">study design</a> that manipulates or strictly observes factors across time is required.  Of these designs, the <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=45858"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Randomized Control Trial</a> design is generally the strongest for that purpose - but that is a discussion in and of itself.</p>

<p>This is a <a href=""http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">humorous website</a> that I share to emphasize the key message to take from this - just because the prevalence or incidence of two variables coincides, you can't say anything about whether there is causation or relationship at all.</p>

<p>To answer your question, in review of the study, there is absolutely no evidence to support that one causes the other, or that they are in any way related.  Any theorizing about why they correlate would have to be tested in another study design in order to hold weight.</p>

 edited by Barbara Lacher.</p>

<p>The other problem with you calculating the dose yourself is that the concentration is expressed as mass fraction, from which one can calculate the total mass of the preparation to be taken. On the other hand the measuring spoon provided (at least according to the attached leaflet) is scaled in milliliters and measures volume. To convert mass to volume you need the density of the preparation, which is not given in this document. This bit is probably known to your physician/health care team.</p>

<h1>Causes</h1>

<p>You can try a Google search, and look at some of the results, to learn <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=why+phobias+develop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">why phobias develop</a>.</p>

<h1>Treatment</h1>

<p>Like all phobias, and like all other anxiety disorders, your fear is treatable. See <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/specific-phobias/diagnosis-treatment/treatment/txc-20253354"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If it's only a tiny problem, maybe you can treat yourself; post a new question asking how. Or you can pay a psychologist the full hourly rate to do the treatment.</p>

<p>If it's a bigger problem (e.g. if you're a primary-school teacher who's just been asked to teach an astronomy unit to your students), your medical insurance will likely cover the treatment. See your doctor.</p>

"Systemic effect of topical diclofenac","63","","<p>Topical diclofenac (as Voltaren gel, for example) is a popular choice for quite a few things, <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/diclofenac-topical-application-route/description/drg-20063434"">from osteoarthritis to sports injuries</a>. </p>

<p>Diclofenac itself can be hard on the body, especially the stomach, but not just because it's taken orally. How much systemic effect does topical diclofenac retain? Is there any rough ""dosage equivalency"", like ""x grams of topical gel a day equals one 15mg tablet in terms of the systemic effect""? </p>
","<p>Not a lot, it seems, which reduces side effects, but of course also makes the effect more local instead of systemic. </p>

<p>The pharmacological study 
<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0091270009336234/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">Systemic Bioavailability of Topical Diclofenac Sodium Gel 1% Versus Oral Diclofenac Sodium in Healthy Volunteers</a> concludes </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Systemic exposure with diclofenac sodium gel 1% was 5- to 17-fold lower than with oral diclofenac. Systemic effects with topical diclofenac were less pronounced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is conclusive with an earlier study <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9794502"" rel=""nofollow"">In vivo bioavailability and metabolism of topical diclofenac lotion in human volunteers</a>, which measured a systemic absorption of around 7 percent (around a 15-fold decrease). </p>

<p>Most side effects from topical diclofenac affect the skin, gastrointestinal system are much lower than when a comparable oral dose is given. For example, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648310"" rel=""nofollow"">in a study on 200 elderly patients</a>, no gastrointestinal issues were reported. A <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21681001"" rel=""nofollow"">meta analysis of 14 studies</a> concludes that it has a low incidence of gastrointestinal issues, with the main complaints being nausea. </p>

<p>However, as the first referenced study also says, topical diclofenac  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 less than oral diclofenac</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And therefore </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Systemic effects with topical diclofenac were less pronounced</p>

"What are the online blood testing services that allow to pick and choose exactly what test you want?","63","","<p>I know there are now several competitive online blood test companies that offer a menu of bundled blood test services in the US.  I am looking for a US based service that would disaggregate their bundled services so you could pick and choose what test you want.  I know Theranos offers that service through Walgreens stores at specific locations.  But, they are nowhere near where I live.</p>

<p>I actually did find such a company about a month ago.  I did not bookmark the site.  And, I have googled searched for it very extensively for a very long time with no success.  It seems this company disappeared.  Maybe someone knows of a similar company.   </p>
","<p>Somehow today I had a bit more luck in addressing my own question.  It seems that many of the online blood testing services do offer tests on a disaggregated basis.  Their more popular products are bundled tests that include some of the typical overall blood tests for an annual physical.  But, several of those enterprises also offer unbundled tests of more esoteric yet very important tests such as for C-Reactive protein and Fibrinogen.  The latter is a very good check to see how granular can you go in terms of specific independent blood tests you can order from such services.  Today, I found two companies that passed that check.  One is Accesa Labs that operates through Quest Diagnostics.  The other one is Health Tests Direct (HTD).  HTD is actually very interesting because they operate through both Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp.  As a result, HTD allows you to do some comparative shopping in terms of test prices between those two market leaders.  </p>

<p>Although the above answer is reasonably inclusive, it does not preclude that others may uncover specific companies that could be equal if not superior to the two I mentioned above. </p>

<p>This is a short update as of December 2017.  As we know Theranos has run into all sorts of legal and regulatory troubles since I first wrote this answer.  They are now I think very much out of this business.  After considering many online lab testing providers I recently chose Personalabs.com.  They allowed you to select your blood test on a disaggregated basis as well as any other online competitors.  What differentiated them is that their website and their blood test selections were so much clearer than competitors.  They operated through Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp just like the other better services.  Interestingly enough, I got my lab test results through Personalabs.com within 5 days.  Yet, over 10 days later, I still could not get the same from Quest Diagnostics (QD).  I am still interested in getting the results from QD just to check that their interpretation of the results (healthy acceptable range of values) are the same as for Personalabs.    </p>

"Why does the flu only happen in winter?","63","","<p>I can understand that our immune system may be weaker when we are cold (?), but since these viruses live inside a human body which internal temperature is constant over the year, why does the season make a difference?</p>

<p>Moreover, we are never sick from the flu in summer, like it does not exist, yet the viruses reappear as soon as the cold season is back. If nobody was sick before winter, where are the viruses coming from?</p>

<p>Do people with a constantly weakened immune system (e.g. AIDS) catch flu in summer too ?</p>
","<p>This is a really interesting question, because it really isn't as easy as people being a bit more susceptible in the winter. There's no definitive answer yet.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jvi.asm.org/content/81/11/5429.full"" rel=""nofollow"">Influenza Seasonality: Underlying Causes and Modeling Theories</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In temperate climates, flu infections at whatever level of intensity are characterized by a flu season. In these areas, the disease is thought to exist at a low level throughout the year but exhibit a marked seasonal increase, typically during the winter months. Influenza epidemics and outbreaks occur in tropical areas as well, although the timing and impact are not as well defined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exact reason why this flu season happens are not known, but a few things come together that are good for influenza:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870528/"" rel=""nofollow"">Vitamin D is thought to help against infection</a> - during the winter, vitamin D production by the body is lower. </li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are debated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crowding and being inside more might be a factor, with people being closer together because they spend a lot of time indoors.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the second question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If nobody was sick before winter, where are the viruses coming from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there's a whole different hemisphere ""down"" from where you probably are, where they have the flu season while the Northern Hemisphere is mostly healthy :) <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145127/"" rel=""nofollow"">Air travel is convenient for influenza.</a> Even without it, we'd still have influenza during the winter, though - as mentioned above it <em>does</em> occur in tropical areas and can spread from there. Also, humans aren't the only species to carry around influenza - <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/transmission.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">wild birds are one of the primary sources of influenza</a>.</p>

<p>Well, everyone can - it's unlikely, <a href=""http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/4/595.full"" rel=""nofollow"">but it does happen</a>. And as flu season passes, there just aren't many people around that you can catch it from.</p>

I take a codeine tablet when i have an attack, or 2 when the pain is really excruciating. </p>

<p>My question is, is it possible to get addicted to this drug by taking about 4 tablets each month? The tablet is made of 300mg acetaminophen and 20mg codeine phosphate.</p>
","<p>Addiction occurs due to chronic or frequent use, which means a lot more often than you're taking it. Since you're going weeks between doses, and you're taking very small doses, there's no danger of you developing a dependence because of the gaps between doses. Your body simply isn't getting it often enough to develop a physical dependence. The danger would come from using it daily or abusing it for recreational purposes. Don't do that and you should be fine.</p>

<p>I've tried to find sources to support the above, but it's actually very difficult to find hard numbers. Nobody wants to put their finger on an amount that leads to addiction since it's going to vary from person to person, but the examples of addiction you can find will always involve daily or near daily use. Infrequent use as you're doing is never how addictions begin as long as they stay infrequent.</p>

"Which foods increase the brain activity?","62","","<p>Are there any foods which can increase the brain activity, and can make you instantly more ""clever""?</p>
","<p>I dont know if our diet can make us cleverer or not but I do know how our food habits can improve the overall functioning of the nervous tissue like memory,reflexes etc.</p>

<p>You see the well being of the nervous system based solely on diet tactics can be undertaken in 5 steps:</p>

<p>1)The neurons communicate with one another via synapses and the working rate of the synapses depends on the availability of neurotransmitter.Neurotransmiter depletion is the main cause of fatigue at the synapses.
Intake of tryptophan rich food like milk ,,egg yolk and legume help in the formation of neurotransmitter serotonin which is thought to be involved in the memory pathways.Intake of choline containing food like eggs,liver,peanuts,spinach,beet,wheat,shell fish etc helps improve acetylcholine formation.</p>

<p>2)The neuronal tissue is broadly segregated into white matter and grey matter.
Compounds like galactocerebrosides are more common in the white matter composition and gangliosides in the grey matter.
Intake of galactose rich food like milk,
essential fatty acids like linolenic acids,rich in walnut oil,soyabean oil,marine fish oils and linolenic acids in safflower and peanut oils help improve the functioning of these tissues.</p>

<p>Also amino acids like cysteine,methionine and serine are essentially helpful in maintaining the health of the nervous system.</p>

<p>3)The nervous system can generate ATP for conduction of impulses only from glucose.So the proper intake of glucose plays an important role too in reducing fatigue.</p>

<p>4)Electrolytes like Na+,K+ are important for conduction of impulses.So they should be considered for intake but in proper quantities.</p>

<p>5)Vitamin B1,B6 is essential for a healthy nervous system.Food like yeast,liver,cereal grains,lentils,fish are rich in both of them.</p>

</ul>

<p>I'd appreciate including source in your answers or just pointing me to any material that would help me understand this in depth. What I'm ultimately interested in is finding the ""time period"" of each nutrient. </p>

<p>I can try to explain more if this is not clear, please leave comments before downvoting. </p>
","<p>Good question(s). I can't answer all of it by I'll try to en light.</p>

<p>Your body obviously needs vitamins, minerals, proteins etc. 
First of all, it needs those in different quantities at different times. Example, need more water if its hot and your exercising. You need more folic acid when you are pregnant (because the new forming child needs it for DNA synthesis). </p>

<p>Secondly, some of those can be stored very in large quantities and for a long period, while others can't. Example, if you have a normal diet your body has a storage of vitamine B12 to last 2 years. As you pointed out, you only last a few days without water intake. </p>

<p>Thirdly, your body can synthesize some nutrients by itself. Vitamine D3 is produced in the skin from cholesterol using UV light. Some aminoacids are synthesized by your body (non-essential amino acids), while others need to be supplied by diet (essential amino acids).</p>

<p>Then another factor of the DRI is how well your body can absorb those nutrients. Example, iron absorption from meat is much better than iron absorption from vegetables. However, water is absorbed for almost 90%.</p>

<p>Also important: There is a huge difference in how well your body can tollerate shortage (deficiency) or overdosis (intoxication) of different nutrients. Example, you can handle enormous amounts of vitamine C, glucose (sugar), fats, proteins and more. However, it can't handle large quantities of iron or tablesalt (actually, the body can regulate its salt levels very well, but eat 6 tablespoons of salt and you need medical care) can be very bad for health.</p>

<p>And last but not least, most of those factors are very different per individual.</p>

<p>So there are numerous factors (and i hardly described them all) that play a role in how much nutrients you can and should take in.</p>

<p>Your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similarly, what are the absorption limits so that if someone tries to cheat by not taking a nutrient for a few days and then trying to make up for it every so often? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As said, that depends on which nutrient. Some you can skip for months (years!) and some you don't. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming Vitamin-A requirements are weekly, does this mean that I'm
  getting about 2.68 times of it? OR (the more likely scenario) that
  some of the carrot vitamin-A is not being absorbed and I'm just
  managing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your body can store vitamine A very well. I can't tell how much days you can ""skip"". The DRI are ""avarage intake"" over a period. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I'm ultimately interested in is finding the ""time period"" of each nutrient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can't be answered. You would need to know for every (which is unknown) nutrient you need:
- how much you as a person need, which differs per individual
- how much of every nutrient is in all foodstuff (which is unknown and differs per appel/tomato/carrot etc)
- how well your individual body absorbs those nutrients
and then calculate it for every nutrient, which are very much.</p>

<p>I'm not a health professional nor diet guru. But my advise: do not worry to much. Wanting to know what you need to eat and what is healthy is a very good custom. But I think you want to calculate everything and that is unhealthy, since it will take you too much time and stress. </p>

<p>Your national dietary guidelines are based on the latest knowledge and research. Try to keep up with them and you will be safe. And have a varied diet! Always eating tomatoes and carrots is not necessarily healthy, as you could miss some less well known proteins and minerals. </p>

"Exercises to stop Muscular Atrophy","61","","<p>My question is straight forward.</p>

<p>How to stop <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_atrophy"" rel=""nofollow"">Muscle atrophy</a>? Does light exercises help??</p>
","<p>Muscle atrophy doesn't have to be bad. Your body tries to fit the situation by decreasing your muscle mass and thus to decrease the needed energy to maintain your body. However, in order to prevent possible muscle atrophy, there have been several methods.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in muscles containing high proportions of type II or fast-twitch fibers. <sup><a href=""http://jap.physiology.org/content/69/3/1058.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you shouldn't know what different muscle fibers are and how they are distributed in your body, I've got you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humans have basically three different types of muscle fibers. Slow- twitch (ST or Type I) fibers are identified by a slow contraction time and a high resistance to fatigue. [...] Most activities of daily living use ST fibers. Fast-twitch (FT or Type II) fibers are identified by a quick con- traction time and a low resistance to fatigue. [...] Fast-twitch fibers are further divided into fast-twitch A (FT -A or Type IIA) and fast- twitch B (FT -B or Type lIB) fibers. FT -A fibers have a moderate resistance to fatigue and represent a transition between the two extremes of the ST and FT -B fibers. [...] Fast-twitch B fibers, on the other hand, are very sensitive to fatigue and are used for short anaerobic, high force production activities, such as sprinting, hurdling, jumping, and putting the shot. [...] <sup><a href=""http://www.coachr.org/fiber.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></sup>
  <hr>
  The distribution of different fiber types varied within the muscles, as a function of depth, with a predominance of type 2b fibers at the surface and type 1 fibers in deeper regions of the muscle. <sup><a href=""http://www.jbiomech.com/article/S0021-9290(04)00514-7/fulltext?mobileUi=0"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it's possible to prevent muscle atrophy in type II muscle fibers by simply exercising.</p>

<p>If you suffer from a serious illness or are physically-challenged, you can maintain your muscle mass by using functional electrical stimulation. The idea is to stimulate your cells so that they keep their current state or to provoke hypertrophy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] Previous research shows that neuromuscular or `functional' electrical stimulation (FES), particularly FES-cycle ergometry (FES-CE) can cause muscle hypertrophy in individuals with chronic SCI (&gt;1 year post-injury). However, the modest degree of hypertrophy in these already atrophied muscles has lessened earlier hopes that FES therapy would reduce secondary impairments of SCI. [...] <sup><a href=""http://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=13624393&amp;AN=8920398&amp;h=l1r6pnlQ8Nst%2BAM28ruDSzOOgOHEZmaVWGVO2zu20aU%2FzQSJZpl%2BbU0mD36uKOHpifwBXAGne4KeQCXtfC263w%3D%3D&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26profile%3Dehost%26scope%3Dsite%26authtype%3Dcrawler%26jrnl%3D13624393%26AN%3D8920398"" rel=""nofollow"">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a short search, I was able to find some experimental studies with rats to investigate muscle atrophy more deeply. It should be obvious that you shouldn't take in Clenbuterol without a consultation with your doctor and of course not solely on the results of the study.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clenbuterol attenuated the decrease in muscle mass and single fiber cross-sectional area in both age groups. By preventing the loss of muscle mass, clenbuterol administered early in rehabilitation may benefit severely debilitated patients imposed by inactivity. [...] <sup><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999301377882"" rel=""nofollow"">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The University of Hull did some research and found out that basic stretching for 30 minutes each day can prevent muscle atrophy in immobilized muscles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] It was found that periods of stretch as short as 1/2 h daily were sufficient not only to prevent loss of sarcomeres but actually to cause an increase in the number of sarcomeres in series. [...] Such short periods of stretch were also found to prevent much of the muscle atrophy normally associated with immobilisation in the shortened position. <sup><a href=""http://ard.bmj.com/content/49/5/316.short"" rel=""nofollow"">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll end up with a study regarding the loss muscle mass in the elderly and how to promote muscle hypertrophy in them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] Strength training appears to elicit effective countermeasures in elderly individuals even at a very old age (>80 years) by evoking muscle hypertrophy along with substantial changes in neuromuscular function, respectively. [...] <sup><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01084.x/full"" rel=""nofollow"">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So long story short: The best way is to simply exercise to keep your muscles and yourself pumped, as @TheEnvironmentalist already said. There are indeed ways to do this by not exercising but the chemical idea as well as the functional electrical stimulation are still in progress. Nonetheless, you should read the corresponding Wikipedia article <sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"" rel=""nofollow"">8</a></sup> to FES to inform yourself in this regard.</p>

"How can I prepare my body for a trip by boat and don't get motion sickness?","61","","<p>I have just made a 3 hours trip by boat and it has been horrible. I have felt sick for the whole trip. I took a pill for motion sickness and although I think it worked at the beginning I just finished the last hour in the toilet.
I don't want to feel it again and I have to take the same trip back in 3 days.<br>
I would like to know if I should eat something special before the trip, or don't eat anything at all. If I should do some exercise. If I should drink water or not?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>Motion sickness is a complicated process, and as you've noticed, different people are affected to different degrees.</p>

<p>People can and do become habituated to vertigo-inducing motion, but it takes a long time. Similarly, the <em>potential</em> benefit you might gain from any exercises you do (they would be similar to those one does when experiencing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) would take weeks to acquire.</p>

<p>There is nothing you can do in this short time span to naturally decrease the probability of having a recurrence. Your best hope is in getting a good drug to prevent it.</p>

<p>Astronauts often experience motion sickness, and the reference I used is from space aviation literature (it is available in full online but as a PDF), and is a pretty thorough treatment of the condition.</p>

<p>There are a few things which (in addition to drugs) might help:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Decrease the motion of your eyes as much as feasible (no reading, people watching, etc.) Instead, look at the horizon. This is because a disparity between brain signals from your eyes and those from your vestibular system often do not correlate well, which is one of the proposed mechanisms of motion sickness.</li>
  <li>If possible, stay outside, or at least where you're getting some fresh air.</li>
  <li>Try to find a spot mid-ship (where there is the least rolling/pitching) and sit, don't stand.</li>
  <li>Try to avoid heavy/greasy meals before travelling, and to avoid strong odors while traveling.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Scopolamine is one of the most effective anti-motion sickness drugs available. Note that a transdermal scopolamine patch doesn't hit it's peak effect until 6-8 hours after it's been applied. Scopolamine isn't for everyone. Ask a pharmacist for drug information if it's available without a prescription where you are.</p>

<p>If you opt for an antihistamine, dimenhydrinate, cyclizine, meclozine, and promethazine are the antihistamines most widely used for prophylaxis and treatment of motion sickness. Since you already tried the dimenhydrinate, you might try a different one. Please note, however, that they should be taken long before the voyage starts to be effective. This might be why yours didn't seem to last. One usually needs to build up to something a bit closer to a steady state.</p>

<p>Cinnarizine is very popular in Europe but it is not available in the United States.</p>

<p>A very small study found ginger (a natural anti-emetic) helpful, but this has been disputed.</p>

<p>This is a presentation of some of the available literature. You need to discuss your specifics (age, medical conditions, etc.) with a doctor or pharmacist.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

"How to loose weight as a 17 year old?","61","","<p>I'm a 17 year old male teenager. Currently my weight is around 95 kg and my height is 175 cm.
This year I need to focus most on my studies and because of this I don't get time to exercise. Also exercising makes me very tired because of which much of my precious time is wasted. I follow a strict vegetarian diet (including dairy products). Sometimes when I have some spare time I do some push-ups and do a little bit of exercise in my room and I'm comfortable doing that. I currently aim to get my weight around 75 kgs. I do walk around 10k steps daily.
So if anyone has some spare time and any suggestion or tip to tell me  they are very much welcomed.🙂
THANK YOU.</p>
","<p>I randomly found your question and I couldn't help but type an answer even though I am no expert (but I have dealt with that issue at times, actually at your age). I do not know what the deal is with this deserted stack exchange, but I will try my best because I found it worrying what you wrote.</p>

<p>You do not have time for some moderate Cardio 30 minutes three times a week? Cardio, not some walking. Forget trackers for the amount of steps, they do not work. You have to do your sport in your room? How is it a waste of time if you want to lose weight? How does one even study with that intensity? Here is my advice: Track every calorie you eat and try to end up with a deficit of 300-500 every single day. There are a couple of apps that can help or you can do it the old school way with pen and paper. You will not lose weight unless you are at a deficit. </p>

<p>I really wonder what you have to study so hard for. I ended up with almost perfect grades at your age and still had the time to lose more than 30 kg with sport, but I also grew up in a Western country where school is really easy. Push ups burn almost no calories, be aware of that. Just walking does a little bit, but it is all too easy to just eat what you have burned in a couple of hours. You will even see that in the long run, instead of making you tired that sport will help you study. Your life has just begun, in 20 years you will run into some serious problems if you do not run enough now. </p>

<p>Also, do not expect fast results. First you lose water and so on and not fat and then your weight will no longer change for a while. This will take some time - we are talking about almost a year here.</p>

<p>So long story short: Track everything (except your steps). This isn't rocket science. If you are a hard studier, you should have no problem with doing some simple calculations.</p>

"Can stem cell (msc) injections regrow damaged (articular / hyaline) cartilage if injected to joint?","60","","<p>I have read that fixated stem cells (mixed with glue, growth factor and fixated in the cartilage defect under low oxygen conditions) will regrow into articular and hyaline cartilage with type II collagen. This type of cartilage is naturally present in joints and is very resistant. </p>

<p><a href=""http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149861"" rel=""nofollow"">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149861</a></p>

<p>But what about stem cell injections? The stem cells with growth factor is injected into joint space and just let to float around.</p>

<p>Naturally cartilage defects in joints will heal with fibrocartilage and type I collagen, which is a lot weaker. So will stem cell injections (with growth factor) just promote the growth of more fibrocartilage and type I collagen in the damaged joint? Or the the very resistant articular cartilage?</p>
","<p>First I should state I'm not in ortho, but have worked some on tissue engineering.  The use of allogenic stem cells (cells from another person) brings a lot of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26328017"" rel=""nofollow"">practical concerns</a>, particularly in the need for <a href=""https://bethematch.org/for-patients-and-families/finding-a-donor/hla-matching/"" rel=""nofollow"">HLA matching</a>, but is the direction of a lot of interesting research.</p>

<p>As may have noticed in the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149861/"" rel=""nofollow"">review</a> you cited, much of the work on joint repair focuses on delivering the patient's own stem cells in a ""patch"" directly to the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17901396"" rel=""nofollow"">injury site</a>.  The main concerns in doing so are that the actual injury site gets repaired (as apposed to a ubiquitous smaller tissue growth) and that teratoma formations or other erroneous and harmful growths don't occur.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the advantage of just being able to inject cells (+factors) would be the simplicity of the procedure.  It has been done in one <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18523506/"" rel=""nofollow"">case patient</a> and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26365972"" rel=""nofollow"">in rats</a>, but the more common procedure is to use <a href=""http://thesteadmanclinic.com/bone-marrow-cell-concentrate-platelet-rich-plasma.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">bone marrow cell concentrate (BMCC)</a>.  </p>

<p>BMCC's do not have the concentrations of stem cells that cultures specifically sorted/selected then expanded do.  It is still exceedingly costly and difficult to culture a patient's mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's).  You look at MSC's wrong and they differentiate.  It is however, to the point where it can be reliably done.</p>

<p>So why use bone marrow concentrate instead?  It can be produced much faster and with equipment/techniques most hospitals already have on hand.  And if we're going to move to an injection over surgical placement of a patch, then we have to make it significantly easier to justify not treating the damage directly.</p>

"Deafness and hearing aids and cochlear implants","60","","<p>I would like to know, <strong>what is the difference between a hearing aid and a cochlear implant</strong>, and <strong>what factors would determine whether you could have one and if so, whether you would want one</strong>?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>The <a href=""https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing-aids#hearingaid_01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIDCD</a> defines a hearing aid as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hearing aid is a small electronic device that you wear in or behind your ear. It makes some sounds louder so that a person with hearing loss can listen, communicate, and participate more fully in daily activities. A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. However, only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one.</p>
  
  <p>A hearing aid has three basic parts: a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. The hearing aid receives sound through a microphone, which converts the sound waves to electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier. The amplifier increases the power of the signals and then sends them to the ear through a speaker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things are a little messy because most people consider <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_trumpet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ear trumpets</a> as an early for of hearing aid despite being completely passive. Additionally, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone-anchored_hearing_aid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bone Anchored hearing aids</a> work in a totally different manner from most hearing aids. The <a href=""http://earlens.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">earlens</a> is also pushing the boundaries of what a hearing aid is.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants#a"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIDCD</a> defines a cochlear implant as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A cochlear implant is very different from a hearing aid. Hearing aids amplify sounds so they may be detected by damaged ears. Cochlear implants bypass damaged portions of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve. Signals generated by the implant are sent by way of the auditory nerve to the brain, which recognizes the signals as sound. Hearing through a cochlear implant is different from normal hearing and takes time to learn or relearn. However, it allows many people to recognize warning signals, understand other sounds in the environment, and understand speech in person or over the telephone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://american-hearing.org/disorders/hearing-aids/#aids"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hearing aid indications</a> are generally <em>mild or moderate bilateral hearing loss, who has experienced a noticeable communication handicap</em>. There is a push now to fit hearing aids to anyone, especially children with communication difficulties (e.g., this <a href=""http://www.audiology.org/news/amplification-normal-hearing-children-apd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AAA report</a>).</p>

<p>As to whether you would want a hearing aid or cochlear implant is a deeply personal question. Those in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deaf Culture</a> tend to be against auditory assistive devices. Hearing aids are low risk and have a limited commitment. Apart from money if you decide you do not like them, you have lost nothing. Cochlear implants are much more expensive, require surgery, and destroy all/most residual hearing. If you do not like the result of the cochlear implant, you cannot go back.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>Does protein powder make you feel full?</strong></p>
","<p>In the last decades, several studies investigating the effect of protein on satiety showed that under most conditions, protein can be more satiating than isoenergetic ingestion of carbohydrate or fat.</p>

<p>This effect has been observed both after a single meal and over 24h. The effect of protein on satiety may be dependent on the type of protein ingested (animal protein, whey vs casein)</p>

","<p>One reason the mouth heals quickly because it's very well vascularized (meaning it has a lot of blood vessels). Yes, the mouth does have a lot of bacteria, but so does the rest of you: humans contain 10x more bacterial cells than human cells, and a lot of those bacteria are extremely helpful to have around. Natural bacteria alone will not reduce healing. Infection with ""bad bacteria"" can reduce healing, but unless a person has poor oral hygiene, there is no reason to suspect they will have ""worse bacteria"" in their mouth compared to anywhere else on their body.

"What exactly is fever?","60","","<p>Pyrexia (or fever) is mostly considered just high temperature, most often caused by infections. Especially in this time of the year, influenza infections that cause fever are quite common.</p>

<p>I would presume that the body heats up in order to kill off bacteria (similar as to why we boil water, and cook food). This doesn't really make much sense when it comes to viruses, as they do not have a similar metabolism. 
Still, one symptom of influenza is pyrexia, so I conclude that pyrexia is triggered in some part of the immune system which does not differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection. I imagine pyrexia to be the body's standard response to an intruder of any kind.
Am I right here?</p>

How does our body increase the temperature?

Also, pyrexia can be achieved by getting exogenous pyrogens, substances from the bacterial debris that can create the same response. Those substances then interact with one part of the brain that regulates the temperature.<br>
That part of the brain serves as a thermostat, meaning it sets the ""default"" body temperature higher in these states. By doing that, the body employs mechanisms to raise the temperature, which result with shaking of the muscles, increase in the metabolic rate, sweating etc. What is interesting is that often people with pyrexia or before the onset of pyrexia feel cold (the default temperature is set to higher point, so the organism feels the current temperature as low).<br>
The point of the fever in this context is not fully discovered, but there is evidence that it provides boost to the immune system production capabilities (increased production of cells to fight the infection etc.) and it might hamper the growth of some infectious organisms that are sensitive to temperature changes.     </p>

<p>To be hyperconcise - fever implies immune system activation against antigen OR presence of exogenous pyrogens released from some bacteria (not all bacteria).    </p>

<p>About failsafe mechanisms - the thermostat here is enough to coordinate between heat production and heat release. If the temperature goes above the ""default"", then the organism has many ways to release excess heat (sweating, inactivity, reducing of the metabolism etc.).  </p>

"Blood donor restrictions (Mad Cow Disease) in Australia/France for people who lived in Britain, is it justified?","59","","<p>I have found out recently that in Australia and France you are not allowed to give blood if you spent more than one year in the UK between 1980 and 1996 because of mad cow disease.</p>

<p>I am wondering why? and if it is reasonable to have this restriction in place? As I'm not really aware of what issues could crop up from this. It is quite frustrating as I was a frequent donor when living in the UK, but now as I am in France I'm not allowed. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","<p>Blood donor restrictiction aims at preventing the transmission of the <strong>variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</strong> (also known as Mad Cow Disease for a layperson), which is a prion disease that leads to irreversible neurodegeneration. Affected patients present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms and eventually die.</p>

<p><em>Here some historical background to understand the rational behind the blood donor restrictions:</em></p>

<p><strong>The first description of the vCJD in human occured in 1996</strong> and was quickly followed by more than 22 others mainly in the UK. Clinical symtoms varied from the previously known sporadic/familial/genetic Creutzfeld-Jakob diseases leading to the definition of a <strong>variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</strong>. Additionally as most cases reported <strong>followed an epidemy of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (the animal variant of the disease)</strong>, a direct link between the diseases (and an animal-human transmission) was made.</p>

<p><em>The issues and the rational for blood donor restrictions:</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>Approximately <strong>50,000 infected cattle are estimated to have entered
the human food chain</strong></li>
<li>at least <strong>five cases of transfusion transmission of vCJD have been reported in the UK</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>limits of 1980 and 1996</strong> have been chosen because the first
descriptions of the BSE have been reported in the 80's. After 1996,
due to strict governmental regulations (such as the prohibition on
ruminant-derived proteins in feeds for all animals and poultry and
the banning of consumption of animals over the age of 30 months) a significant decline in BSE cases was noted, limiting the possibility of an animal-human transmission.</li>
<li>the <strong>current prevalence of vCJD in the originally affected countries is unknown</strong> and hence makes it difficult to decide on the best approach. In the UK population some studies have suggested that it might be between 120 to 237 per million inhabitants but those values are highly debated (some suggesting it might be lower)</li>
<li><strong>the incubation period of vCJD is long to very long</strong> (several years to decades) so people who are infected might be asymptomatic at the time they donate blood.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Blood donor restrictions vary between countries, some beeing more restrictive than others according to their respective public health policy.</strong></p>

"Do the derivatives of cannabis have the same effect on the brain?","59","","<p>grass, hashish, hash oil... I've read THC is the active ingredient in all these. But I've heard people saying they have different mental effects. Can you please explain?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hemp</a> has a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986974"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">highly heterogenous</a> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915313"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chemical composition</a>. <sup>∆9</sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tetrahydrocannabinol</a> (THC) is just one of many active substances. Although THC is the most psychotropic 'ingredient' in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cannabis</a> it is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28120229"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by far</a> not the only <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cannabinoid</a> responsible for different experiences with different preparations.</p>

<p>The most important difference in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">outcomes</a> of hemp consumption is from the different <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875990"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">overall concentrations <em>and</em> ratios</a> of mainly THC and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cannabidiol</a> (CBD) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cannabis_foods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">route</a> of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cannabis_smoking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">administration</a> (not to discount the other chemicals present).</p>

<p>That means it is more dependent on the strain used than the preparation in question. Only when using the same plant for different preparations you might reason that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grass</a> is just dried and cured flowers (with a concentration of molecules as produced by nature), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hashish</a> is then a 'step up' with higher concentration (but with roughly the same ratio of chemicals from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichome"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trichomes</a>) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_oil"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oil</a> as the highest concentration (made through a highly chemical extraction process).</p>

<p>So, there is not really much of a difference (assuming e.g. that with oil there are no solvents left in the finished product): </p>

<ul>
<li>It is depends on the source material</li>
<li>It depends on the quality standard of preparation</li>
<li>It depends on the amount of active chemicals delivered, their ratio to one another, the route, and speed of uptake</li>
</ul>

<li><a href=""https://www.rxlist.com/marinol-side-effects-drug-center.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">THC isolated</a> on itself can be <em>quite</em> <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8774-1840/dronabinol-oral/dronabinol-solution-oral/details#side-effects"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nasty</a>. People talking about ""Cannabis overdose"" are mostly talking of too much of <em>this</em> cannabinoid. You can get too high.</li>
<li>To mitigate these unwanted effects of THC (and other cannabinoids working like this) a certain level of CBD is needed. While CBD will not be making you ""high"", it is <em>technically</em> <a href=""https://herb.co/2017/03/24/cbd-psychoactive/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">psychoactive</a> in having (among others) a certain relaxing effect and more importantly modulating the effect of THC. They work synergistically.</li>
<li>Returning to the problem of <a href=""https://www.projectknow.com/research/marijuana-overdose/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">overdose</a>: eating and drinking are slower to set on – smoking, vaporising have a faster onset. But with inhaling the effects are usually  felt within seconds compared to up to hours when ingesting the material. That means a user smoking can stop much sooner once she approaches or oversteps hers limits. Eating on the other hand needs very careful testing and dosing: once is is swallowed then that is the ride you booked and paid for, no refunds. And that brings us back to oil extracts. Smoking oil, made from fairly THC rich material to begin with or ending up that way, might overwhelm you on the first draw.</li>

"Does conscious sleep impair immunity?","59","","<p>It's common knowledge that getting insufficient sleep makes people immune-compromised.</p>

<p>However, what about light rest? In particular, if you spend a significant amount of sleeping hours conscious (but sleeping by every other part of the definition) does that impair immunity?</p>

<p>For reference, this condition could be caused by sleeping disorders or other health conditions.</p>
","<p>This is currently a researchable topic in neuroscience.
Actually its not about light sleep or deep sleep or resting.Neuroscience prefers to describe sleep in the context of the immunity into mainly two stages: REM(Rapid Eye movement)sleep and non-REM.</p>

<p>Every sleep cycle occurs broadly in the given stages:
wakefulness ->rest ->non REM->REM-> non REM/wakefulness</p>

<p>You see every stages has varying hours in total sleeping duration and is different at different ages.
The REM sleep is the also called paradoxical sleep because the EEG records are similar to that of wakefulness and it is during this stage that we dream.
It is actually this stage of sleep that is responsible for boosting immunity.That is why it has been experimentally determined in rats that when they are deprived of REM sleep continuously for a few days they die.</p>

<p>Like I said REM sleep is still under study and  is a matter of greater reasearch.</p>

<p>Lately I've been using an app to measure my heart rate using my phone. In the few that I've tried they only say that it works putting your index finger over the camera and flash but they don't give any further explanation. How does this determine your heart rate? </p>

"How to determine if a pill needs to be taken with food?","59","","<p>Some supplements state e.g. that the pills should be taken with a small amount of peanut butter. My understanding is that this is because the particular supplement is fat-soluble.</p>

<p>Some other supplements on another hand do not say anything about the need to take the pill with any kind of food. Sometimes this is of course because the pill does not need to be taken with any food.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, is there a way to check whether a particular substance should be taken with some form of food to help the body absorb it?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I wanted this question to be as generic as possible, so that it is applicable to <strong><em>any</em></strong> substances that humans may take for ""health"" reasons. Examples of these kinds of substances include <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0019LWV92"" rel=""nofollow"">Glutathione</a> and <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0013OUQ3S"" rel=""nofollow"">Nac-Acetyl Cysteine</a>.</p>

<p>On another hand I am not asking for anyone to create a list that indicates which substances are fat soluble and which are not; rather I am looking for a generic way to determine this.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this question, the answer may be as simple as checking the information in some specific book or website. This would be an acceptable answer, as long as that source is viewed as authoritative on this subject and name/URL is provided.</p>
","<p>The FDA requires labeling of prescription medications. Pharmacies will often attach a label on the bottle for patient-dependent behaviors. Therefore the easiest way (in the US) to tell if you need to take a medication with food or on an empty stomach is by reading the prescription bottle:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJCCJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJCCJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>A patient can also ask for a <em>package insert</em>, which will contain much more information.</p>

<p>For OTC medications, a readable label is also required with quite a lot of the necessary information.</p>

<p>However, supplements are not governed by the FDA, therefore, the makers are under no obligation to include pertinent information, relying on the consumer to know the particulars for that supplement.</p>

<p>The only practical way to know whether your particular supplement should be taken with food is to look up that information yourself. </p>

<p>In the case of glutathione, for example, a reliable source of information will be hard to find, because anyone can make any claim about a supplement and often will (for monetary gain.)</p>

<p>Even so, there exist some resources, such as Examine.com and PubMed. From PubMed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research suggests that glutathione is not orally bioactive, and that very little of oral glutathione tablets or capsules is actually absorbed by the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it doesn't seem to matter if it's on an empty or full stomach.</p>

<p>From Examine.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is, currently, no known benefit of orally ingested glutathione that cannot be more readily mimicked by supplementation of N-acetylcysteine and couldn't theoretically be aided by a high protein diet including dietary sources rich in L-cysteine (whey protein).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, for <a href=""http://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">N-Acetylcysteine</a>, Examine.com gives this advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does Not Go Well With

<blockquote>

<p>In scientific terms, this is known as the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448690/"">hygiene hypothesis</a>. It was proposed in 1989 by Strachan and is about whether people who have been exposed to a lower amount of pathogens in their childhood are more likely to develop autoimmune or hypersensitivity (allergy) disorders later in life. Strachan actually didn't propose it in the context of hygiene, but in the context of families having less children and thus <a href=""http://thorax.bmj.com/content/55/suppl_1/S2"">children being exposed to their siblings' infections less often</a>, though. He found that children with fewer siblings had a higher incidence of asthma and hayfever and came up with the hypothesis to explain his observation. The name has stuck, though.</p>

<p>Is it true? Possibly.</p>

<p>Chromic inflammatory diseases are in fact <a href=""http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/2013/1/46"">more prevalent in the so-called developed world</a>. As Ghana got richer and presumably 'cleaner', the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1808098/"">rates of allergies and asthma increased</a>.</p>

<p><em>The role of vaccinations</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>letting your kids get low-risk childhood sicknesses like mumps, rubella or chickenpox is ""training"" their immune systems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, no, even despite the hygiene hypothesis.</p>

<p>First of all, whether these are not low-risk diseases is in fact debatable, but outside the scope of this question, I think. Mumps and measles can end in encephalitis. Since you can not guarantee that every child who isn't vaccinated will get the disease 'naturally', not vaccinating compromises <a href=""http://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/"">herd immunity</a> and can lead to the more vulnerable members of society (small children, immunocompromised patients, pregnant women) being exposed, which can lead to severe consequences.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which all of this works is a lot more complicated than that the immune system needs to be kept <strong>busy</strong>, though. It depends on <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5567/490.short"">what the infections are, when they are, and what kind of immune response they raise</a>.</p>

<p>Scientists have tried to determine <em>which</em> pathogens play a role in the hygiene hypothesis, and the result is now called the <em>old friends hypothesis</em>. From the summary of the <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04133.x/full"">99<sup>th</sup> Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The most relevant organisms are those that co-evolved with mammals, and already accompanied early hominids in the Paleolithic.</li>
  <li>More recently evolved ‘childhood infections’ are not likely to have evolved this role, and recent epidemiology supports this contention.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Pathogens usually indicated in research are <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5567/490.short"">worm/parasite infections</a>, and general exposure to bacteria from the environment.

<p>We have a friend who was dairy free with her son, and since she stopped breastfeeding and could consume dairy again she's had trouble with dairy products.</p>

<p>Is there any way to maintain lactase production while going dairy free, without having to consume dairy? Or a proven way to restore lactase production back to original levels when she does start consuming dairy?</p>
","<p>First, let me highly commend your wife.  The <a href=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">WHO recommendation</a> for breastfeeding up to 2yr is not for show.  It really can help prevent a whole slew of problems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no there are no ways to maintain lactase production in a prolonged lactose free diet.  She may get extremely luckily and maintain the bacteria that are needed on her own, but she should not attempt to reintroduce dairy into her diet without the go-ahead from your pediatrician (assuming she's still breastfeeding).</p>

<p>In regards to the second question, can lactase production be regained, my answer is not yet but soon.  The textbook and <a href=""http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/lactose/conditioninfo/Pages/managed.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">US-FDA approved methods</a> for dealing with lactose intolerance are mostly to avoid dairy and take lactase supplements or tilactase (which will not increase lactase production on their own).</p>

<p>There is, however, a drug currently being studied called <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=GOS%2FRP-G28"" rel=""nofollow"">RP-G28</a> (I'm sure they will come up with a nice trade name if it makes it to market).  The results were promising.  Further, there have also been some <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20391953"" rel=""nofollow"">promising studies</a> with probiotics, in particular <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_reuteri"" rel=""nofollow"">Lactobacillus reuteri</a>, as a possible solution.

<hr>

<p>As a small warning, you have to be very careful when you are shopping for probiotics.  It is unfortanitely not well regulated, and the way in which the bacteria are packaged can greatly effect if they are useful or not.  For the most part you are going to want live cultures, and if they are reduced to a pill form, you want them lyophilized not heat treated or dehydrated.  Many times it can be difficult to get this information from the manufacturer, so please be very careful when shopping.  It may be best to ask a medical professional what is available in your markets (including online markets if you have access).</p>

","<p>I have found that I did not have weak quads but that my abs were not doing enough work and this was placing more stress on my left quad initially which became injured and placed more stress on my right quad subsequently.</p>

<p>The injury was occurring from my <strong>teeth</strong>. I have realised, from consultation with a qualified physiotherapist and wearing a mouth guard, that I tend to bite or grind my teeth throughout the day and hold my breath. This closes my airways. Over a long period of time this has negative effects on my abs as my lungs are not expanding to their potential and in turn not keeping my abs activated. My abdominal muscles, particularly on my right side due to there being more internal organs on that side of the body, were shuting off.</p>

"MD-PhD vs DVM-PhD","58","","<p>I am a high school senior planning to attend university this Fall and major in Biomedical Engineering.  </p>

<p>I plan to perform biomedical research as a career after my PhD. My objective is to push the treatment and cure of diseases forward - I would like to see human suffering diminished and eliminated as much as possbile during my lifetime.   </p>

<p>I have been advised that a practical doctorate would help me achieve my goals, so I am considering earning a DVM or an MD alongside a PhD.  <strong>My question is, which should I choose?</strong> </p>

<p>In other words, what sort of research and application will I perform with a DVM-PhD vs an MD-PhD, and how substantially will my work affect human health?  I ask because I have recieved mixed signals when questioning vets and doctors in the same manner.  </p>

<p>They usually said that 'the DVM would be good for animal modeling of human diseases, while the MD would be good for direct application to humans.'  But in the professional world this seems much more convoluted - for instance, a DVM-PhD at my university of choice is the leading researcher for human regenerative medicine at that particular institution.  </p>

<p>I need to make a decision within a year as to which 'track' I will pursue becuase each degree has slightly different undergraduate couse commitments, volunteering requirements, etc.  </p>

<p>If anyone is knowledgeable on this subject, I would deeply appreciate all the help I can get!</p>
","<p>This is a complicated question, as there are likely few people (I am not one of them) who are fully knowledgeable in the scope of both DVM and MD or DO (which is the other type of physician degree) in combination with PhD, and I do not know if someone with that knowledge will see this question.  But your question is a very good question - I would recommend you seek out and ask MD PhDs, DVM PhDs, MDs, and PhDs to explore your options.  It's an important decision.  </p>

<p>I can help from the perspective of an MD/MPH (Masters in Public Health) who has done some research, and I have colleagues who do many different types of research with varying combinations of degrees. MD or DO alone, MD or DO + PhD, or just PhD (e.g. in fields like biomedical engineering).</p>

<p>There are a number of MD-PhD or DO-PhD combined programs where usually you do 2 years of med school, then complete the PhD (which often is 4 but can be much more), then return for the last 2 years of medical school - and may or may not go on to complete residency.  Some MD/DO PhDs practice clinical medicine, whether they do research or not.  I imagine this is much the same for DVM-PhD programs.</p>

<p>But more to the point, what is most important is for you to reflect on your ultimate goals.  Are you specifically interested in working on animal models?  Or do you want to obtain the education that provides you the most possible options, so that you can determine along the way where you feel you can make the greatest impact?</p>

<p>There are vast numbers of ways to engage in research that improves the health of humans, and animal models is only a subset of the diverse possibilities.  </p>

<p>The potential advantages of DVM over an MD/DO is something I had not previously considered, and I can see how expertise in the animal models would be beneficial in some research.  But again, are you sure you want to focus primarily on animal models?  Consider that DVM may limit your scope of what you can do in clinical research involving human subjects.  </p>

<p>The other paths include MD or DO alone, MD PhD, DO PhD, PhD alone (in fields like Biomedical Engineering etc), PharmD (pharmacy doctorate), or others.</p>

<p>Of the two you mentioned, the MD-PhD (or PhD alone) may open more doors for you in research overall, since animal research is only one section of medical research.  The MD/DO when combined with PhD does give advantages over PhD alone in some circumstances, from what I understand, but is not always necessary.</p>

<p>What an MD/DO can give you is a thorough grounding in both the fundamentals of human physiology/pathophysiology AND its clinical management.  Completing a residency in clinical medicine also gives you the experience and skills to actually <em>practice</em> medicine in addition to doing research.</p>

<p>Again, I recommend talking with people with the degrees and combinations I mentioned.  Your school's advising counselors should be able to help arrange that, or contact a local university with a med school or phd program to request to speak with their advisors, or with researchers.  They may help you as a prospective student.</p>

<p>As a parting thought, you might also consider public health if you are aiming to do what you say here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>see human suffering diminished and eliminated as much as possbile during my lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Public health is sometimes overlooked, since people don't necessarily know about it as a field - but they definitely know the effects of it.  Public health is all about improving the health of entire populations through multiple angles, including many branches of research.  It incorporates (and offers specializations in) epidemiology, biostatistics, disease prevention, education, program design and analysis, population management, policy and administration, and other elements.  Vaccinating the population has been a joint effort of medical research and public health. </p>

<p>Read about public health and maybe talk with the department at a university - it's actually a really rich and diverse field with lots of opportunities.  </p>

"Does the rate of ethanol absorption into blood stream slow down as you drink more?","57","","<p>My coworker and I were having a discussion over the rate of alcohol absorption.  He argued that after you reach x number of drinks, your body stops passing as much ethanol into the bloodstream because it ""knows"" when your blood is too saturated with ethanol. He didn't say that ethanol would not be entirely blocked from entering the blood stream, just that the rate would slow down the more you drank. </p>

<p>Is there any truth to this? </p>
","<p>Alcohol is absorbed from the stomach and small intestine by diffusion. Most absorption occurs from the small intestine due to its large surface area and rich blood supply.</p>

<p>However, above a certain alcoholic concentration, the rate of absorption may decrease due to the delayed passage of alcohol from the stomach into the small intestine.</p>

<p>The maximum absorption rate is obtained with the consumption of an alcoholic beverage containing approximately 20-25% (by volume or v/v) alcohol solution on an empty stomach. The absorption rate may be less when alcohol is consumed with food or when a 40% (v/v) alcohol solution is consumed on an empty stomach. The rate may also slow down when high fluid volume/low alcohol content beverages, such as beer, are consumed.</p>

"Eradicating HIV","57","","<p>If HIV is spread by intercourse, then it is completely under our control if diagnosed people just don't have sex. Why is that so hard? We could soon eradicate the disease from at least the developed world.</p>
","<p>It's quite easy to be infected with HIV and not know it. HIV is notoriously stealthy, often producing no symptoms for months or even years, and in the meantime the person can transmit the disease. That scenario describes a large percentage of the people who have transmitted the disease. </p>

<p>Then there are the people who don't even know it exists, much less how to prevent it. A lot of the world isn't educated and doesn't have access to modern health care. </p>

<p>Intercourse isn't the only way to transmit it. Sharing needles is a common route of infection among drug addicts, and in third world countries where medical supplies are scarce, needles are sometimes reused. Infections have also occurred via organ donations, accidental exposure to body fluids (usually medical personnel), and from mother to child both in vitro and via breast milk. </p>

<p>Thousands of people died of AIDS due to HIV infections they acquired from blood transfusions and organ donations before HIV was recognized and screened for. That probably still happens in third world countries where they don't have the money or facilities to screen adequately.</p>

<p>And of course, there are the sociopaths who just don't care. There are people who know they are HIV+ and will still go out and have unprotected sex without informing their partners. </p>

<p>And finally, you might want to consult a few religions about convincing people not to have sex. Several of them have been trying to do that for thousands of years and every one of them has failed miserably.</p>

<p>So it's a nice idea, but it would take a large coordinated effort by most countries around the world (lasting many years and costing many billions) to eradicate it entirely. As you might imagine, the political, financial and logistical difficulties such a program faces are rather large.</p>

<p>If he starts brushing his teeth with fluoride toothpaste, will the toothpaste help in slowing down his tooth decay, and/or have other positive and negative side effects? </p>
","<p>This is usually seen in clinical settings: a child is left with an untreated enamel caries. Then the lesion progress and the lesion is cavitated. The dentin then start to react, ocludding the dentinal tubules. When the saliva (+ minerals) reach the dentin, the caries process start to slow down and the dentin change from dark brown to almost black. At the same time, the change in color represents a change in the surface composition, changing from a soft surface to a hard one. </p>

<p>This occurs with the minerals of the saliva. If you add fluoride, you will enhance this process. Hence, <strong>the fluoride of the toothpaste will slow down the caries process in the dentin</strong>. </p>

","<p>They can both be bad; it depends greatly on the type of wound.  Dogs are responsible for the vast majority of bites, hospitalizations, and deaths, but there's some suggestion that when cats do bite, it's more likely to cause serious problems, but the numbers of cat bites are small, so it's hard to say for sure.</p>

<p>Statistically, dogs are are the cause of 85% - 90% of bites in the US, and ~50% of those bites are unprovoked.  Cats are responsible for 5% - 10% of bites, and close to 100% of those bites are provoked.  </p>

<p>Neither cats nor dogs are known for their dental hygiene, so both cat and dog bites are at high risk for infection.  There's also a chance, especially in older animals, that some portion of the tooth breaks off and is left in the bite wound.  It seems that cat bites are more likely to be deep puncture wounds than dog bites, and, as such are more likely to cause a serious infection, but cat bites are also much rarer than dog bites.</p>

<p>With cat bites, some people can go into anaphylactic shock, which is less likely with dog bites.  </p>

<p>In the human body (and generally in nature) there are only physical and <strong>biochemical mechanisms</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>All behaviours</strong> that are described by the behavioural sciences (e.g. psychology) can be interpreted by biochemical mechanisms. For example, if you suddenly feel threatened then your heart rate will increase and you will feel the urge to either run away or get very aggressive and stay put. That's because a chemical reaction in your brain triggered the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fight-or-flight response</a> and cortisol is having a party with adrenaline and all your internal organs are invited.</p>

<p>You won't be a coward if you run away and not evil if you decide to fight... it doesn't matter how you were raised or what you believe in because even if you are a pacifist, you will try to protect yourself if you have to and chemistry is on your side.
The same principle applies to everything else, including 
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression#Physiology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aggression</a> which can be influenced by numerous hormones that themselves are influenced by numerous situations and of course <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_of_aggression"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">genetics</a>.</p>

"Can acidic water be a pure water substitute","56","","<p>I have never really liked water that much. I always drank water because of it's importance to the human body. However, I mostly see myself drinking two glasses of water a day sometimes one to none. </p>

<p>At my Job we have sparkling water with some bottles of concentrated lemon. So I usually drink a glass of water with a few drops of concentrated lemon. I love the taste and it motivates me to drink even about 6 glasses a day (two glasses earch @ 9am; 12am 3am). </p>

<p>So my question is, are there any dangers of drinking lemon mixed water and can this be a substitute for pure water ?</p>
","<p>As you can see lemon juice is something that can adversely affect your enamel (<a href=""https://www.pronamel.us/tooth-erosion/causes-of-acid-erosion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>). Acid affects your teeth because it leeches calcium from them (<a href=""https://www.deltadentalins.com/oral_health/acid_wear.html"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>). When this happens your enamel breaks down making your teeth are more vulnerable to bacteria and plaque which then leads to decay. Pure lemon juice is not something you should be downing constantly throughout the day if you want to protect your teeth. That being said it probably isn't enough acidity to affect your stomach enough to cause acid reflex.</p>

<p>However you are drinking very dilute amounts of lemon juice which probably makes the effects negligible. I can't find any research to support this (there isn't much on this topic) but unless you are also drinking something very acidic on top of the lemon water I'm sure you will be fine.</p>

<p>Just to keep an eye out you should look for signs of tooth decay, <a href=""https://www.deltadentalins.com/oral_health/acid_wear.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is a good place to check for signs/symptoms. However ignore the advice that ""all carbonated drinks"" harm your enamel. This is simply not true since not all carbonated drinks contain high amounts of acidic compounds. However, this is true of all soft drinks (aka a ""soda"").</p>

<p>To ease your mind, lemon juice with mineral water is a traditional drink in Italy and across most of Europe. I personally have grown up drinking it, along with all of my relatives, and have never experienced any enamel weakening. In fact my dentist regularly comments that I have incredibly strong teeth.</p>

<p>Still this simple breakdown of highly acidic beverages may help you avoid damaging your enamel too much, if you are worried of such things(<a href=""http://www.daterdentistry.com/News/ID/246/Drink-This-Not-That-Top-Most-Acidic-Drinks-Healthy-Alternatives"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).</p>

","<p>I checked myself and found that yes, prediabetes is also a risk factor for coronary heart disease.</p>

<p>Prediabetes is the condition when fasting blood sugar is 100-125 mg/dl or 2 hour blood sugar is 140-200 mg/dl (more than 125 fasting or >200 after 2 hours will be diagnostic of diabetes).</p>

<p>A number of longitudinal studies have shown that prediabetes is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease which may cause angina, heart attack and sudden death.</p>

<p>Hence, lifestyle modification is advised to all persons with prediabetes. These include regular exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, stopping smoking,  keeping blood cholesterol and blood pressure under control.</p>

<p>Persons who have other risk factors of coronary heart disease also, such as high blood pressure, obesity, increased blood lipids etc, may also be treated with metformin, a commonly used drug for control of diabetes.</p>

<p>These interventions reduce the risk of progression to diabetes and occurrence of its complications including coronary heart disease.</p>

<p>Some also recommend use of aspirin and/or statins for persons at high risk for coronary heart disease.</p>

"Catch a cold from the grass?","56","","<p>Every time I play with the dogs in the backyard, then the next day I get what feels like a 24-hour head cold. I've verified this at least 7 times.

"Does ""Hot soup on a hot day keep you cool""?","56","","<p>I don't know if I should ask this question on skeptics.se first, but I guess I'll try here first:</p>

<p>When I was a kid in summer camp, they served hot soup every day during lunch, even during a heat wave, with temps in the 100s. The head counselor would announce ""Hot soup on a hot day keeps you cool"". Was he just trying to get us to eat or is it true? And, my main question is, how does it work?</p>
","<p>Surprisingly when I was looking this up, I figured out it was true. Due to <a href=""http://m.jap.physiology.org/content/116/8/1088"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recent research</a>, the below was realised.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we’re hot, we naturally cool our bodies primarily by sweating, or more specifically by having the sweat evaporate from our skin (that’s important!). Our bodies sense changes in tissue temperature by a network of thermosensors located in the skin and in more central parts of our body, which send input to our brain (specifically, the hypothalamus), which then initiates sweating.</p>
  
  <p>When we take in a hot drink, it appears that the thermosensors located in the stomach become overactive, and send strong signals to our hypothalamus that we are hot. In turn, the hypothalamus reacts by initiating an over-compensatory sweating response. So, when this sweat evaporates from our skin, the heat energy we lose due to evaporation exceeds the heat energy gained by drinking the hot drink. In other words, it is because our body overacted to the hot drink that we end up cooler in the end</p>

<p><strong>I have several bowel motions in the morning – the first may be before breakfast (immediately after awakening). Subsequent bowel motions may be only 20-30mins apart and are usually looser and looser each time up to 3 times before lunch. Subsequent bowel motions are followed by large intestinal pain around rectum or Abdominal pain,  usually in the lower abdomen</strong></p>

<p>This problem leads to less focus in my work and daily life stuff.</p>
","<p>Although the best thing to do is to go and see a doctor there are a few factors which you could work on to determine what causes your symptoms. </p>

<p>It might be that some kinds of food make you feel worse, for example spiced foods, foods with lots of fats, processed red meat, foods too rich in fiber like legums or vegetables and diary products are more likely to irritate your bowel. Similarly, drinking fizzy drinks, alcohol, coffee or tea can also cause irritation. <strong>So keeping an eye on what food you consume could help improve your lifestyle.</strong></p>

<p>Another thing which can cause IBS is stress along with anxiety, which can both lead to an increased mobility of the colon (the place of the bowel where thousands of bacteria like e. coli process your food). This will then cause abdominal pain, especially if gas is formed inside your bowel. There are some kind of <strong>tablets sold in pharmacies which target IBS symptoms</strong> and reduce pain due to gases. <strong>Taking on a sport activity might be helpful as it often reduces stress.</strong></p>

<p>Mind that, unless you have been diagnosed with IBS, your symptoms could also describe a food intolerance.  </p>

<p>As of today, there is no agreement among the scientific community on the causes of IBS, and there is no known ""cure"". Moreover, there is a lot of information on the Internet regarding which foods one should eat to ease symptoms but you might find that even following a diet might not help you, especially if your condition is determined by psychological factos such as stress. <strong>Engaging in relaxing activities and taking bacteria supplements usually helps</strong>. You might need to find out on your own which foods are good and which ones are not, so <strong>keeping a diary of what you eat</strong> might be useful. </p>

<p>Also, if you symptoms are affecting your life so much it would be a good idea to go talk to a doctor to ask if they can give you any tablets to reduce the inflamation.   </p>

<p>As for the rectum pain, it might be because the irritation has spread from your colon to the rectus or because of friction, either way you should see a doctor who then could prescribe you some <strong>lotion</strong> to apply there.  </p>

"What is the amount of caffeine in the human body over time?","56","","<p>Let's say I know how much caffeine I drank and when. Just knowing my sex, weight (and maybe height), what is the best estimate for how much caffeine is in my system now?</p>

<p>For example: Suppose I drank 180 mg of caffeine 5 hours ago, another 180 mg of caffeine 2 hours ago, I'm female and weigh 140 pounds.</p>

<p>I'm guessing food intake may also have a lot to do with it, but let's ignore that. Is a good estimate available?</p>

<p><em>Motivation:</em> I am logging my blood pressure and want to know if it's correlated with the amount of caffeine in my blood. Rather than just write down how much caffeine I had that day, I wondered if there might be a better measure of how much caffeine I have at the time of measurement.</p>

<p>Knowing the above plus how much caffeine you've ingested will allow you to plot caffeine levels over time. Given the wide variation in half-life, I'm going to ignore the 99% absorption and treat it as 100%. Using your example we get:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 180 mg you ingested 5 hours ago is now down to 90 mg.</li>
<li>The 180 mg you ingested 2 hours ago is now down to 136 mg. </li>
<li>Therefore, there are now 90 + 136 = 226 mg in your system. </li>

  Rapeseed oil contains very high levels of erucic acid, a compound that

<p>Edit to take count of the article you cited:</p>

<ul>
<li>According to the Mayo Clinic article cited previously, it's the reverse, rapeseed oil is dangerous while canola oil isn't.</li>
<li>Canola oil can be hydrogenated, like all oils, but it's not always the case. Here, the pill bottle indicated 0g of trans fat, which indicates that the oil used in the pills isn't hydrogenated. But the law in the US allow companies to write 0g as long as it's under 0,5g so it might not be really trans fat-free. The term cold-pressed normally means the oil hasn't been heated, and thus isn't hydrogenated.
Finally, I can't find a clear mention of whether indicating if an oil is hydrogenated is mandatory in the US or not, but the FDA (which banned trans fats in June) and the Mayo Clinic do recommend checking it to avoid trans fats, which seem to mean it's mandatory.
Based on all this, I would think the canola oil in these pills isn't hydrogenated.</li>
<li>There is no GMO labeling in the US.

"Dangers of smoking hookah","55","","<p>In my country, hookah just became insanely popular.
Government agencies alongside health organizations mobilized and started to forbid smoking under the pretense that it is as unhealthy as cigarettes, <strong>or maybe even more unhealthy</strong>.</p>

<p>But that's gonna be a lie right? No one died from hookah.
So my question is smoking hookah really unhealthy and if so, how unhealthy it is?</p>
","<p>Well, it isn't healthy.
It will not provide you vitamins, or cure you from cold.</p>

<p>TL;DR
But it isn't <em>very</em> unhealthy. What that means is that there are health <strong>risks</strong> you must take into account and decide whether it worths it. Smoking hookah can also be very beneficial in terms of the way you feel. For some people, those benefits overly exceed these on cigarettes, which is one of the reasons they quit smoking, which is a good thing, because cigarettes are more harmful than hookah, but they can also be less harmful than hookah. It depends on how much you smoke. The more you smoke the more the risk increases. People have tendency to abuse cigarettes more than hookah, partially because smoking cigarettes is easier, cheaper and more practical.</p>

<p>So, generally there are much more harmful chemicals in generic tobacco, but we will discuss the top 3 most hazardous of them. Videlicet:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/240820.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nicotine</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(tobacco_residue)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tar</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/1209952-co-and-co2-what-s-the-difference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carbon monoxide (and dioxide when oxygenation)</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's start off with the nicotine.</h2>

<p>Not all hookah is prepared with a tobacco that contains nicotine. It could still be tobacco, but wiped out tobacco, soaked in water even boiled, until its full purification. I would still not give my bets on that though as it may still contain some levels of nicotine, which immediately turns it into an unhealthier product. You can also smoke shisha gels, shisha fruits, steam stones and Hookah Creams - all of these do not contain nicotine unless explicitly added.
Although there is insufficient evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, there is an ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. Almost all hookah tobacco (like Al. Fakher, Gazi and whatever) contain approximately .05% nicotine. If it says .5%, that is probably a typo. Nakhla shisha is the only brand that boast .5% approx.
these percentages will stay the same regardless of whether you load a 20g bowl or a 100g bowl. That means if you buy 50grammes you will be smoking 0.025mg of nicotine around 5 times. Note that this is the general content of nicotine not the actual amount, being absorbed from the organism. The smoker inhales smoke, by which the nicotine absorbs. Hookah is something to be shared with a company, so very often it is being shared from 2 to even up to 10 people, distributing the total nicotine intake, but eventually exposing all to the secondhand smoke. How much of the substance you would get is determined by variety of different factors such as how long you smoke, how much smoke you inhale, how often you inhale. Some people think that because of the huge amount of smoke the hookah produces it is by any chances loading you with much higher levels of nicotine, which is not true, because 1. 50% of the smoke being produced is actually a vegetable glycerine and 2. Because the nicotine level will not magically increase, specially for your bigger clouds. Bigger clouds only means overtoasting the tobacco, which ultimately leads to a reducing time of use. At least pleasurable time. Almost all the times bigger clouds means shorter hookah session lifespan. One hookah session can vary but people generalize it to between 45 minutes and one hour. So there is still some nicotine you will absorb, which makes it unhealthy. Lots of people smoke cigarettes for 45 minutes too, smoking much cigarettes that contain much higher density of poison.
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928221/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nicotine leads to addiction</a>. Adding good flavors only make it more charming and more addictive.</p>

<h2>Tar</h2>

<p>The tar is a known carcinogen.
Sometimes, this substance is even more dangerous, because unlike the nicotine, which absorbs in your body fast, the tar does not and it produces dense accumulation over time, that kills the pulmonary tissue. It may also cause cancer. (<a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=743063"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Support Reference</a>)
The process of purifying tobacco removes some of the tar, but not completely.
Cigarettes take advantage of some 3 centimeter filter of ""foam"" while the hookah gives you a few hundreds of water filtration, which ""wash"" the smoke itself.
And it works a-okay. As the time goes and you smoke, you can notice that the water becomes more yellowish. Some people wrongly assume that's all tar, but it is proven that it contains so much more, including molasses and solid particles /heavy metals. The water does not only filter, but it also cools down the smoke and when the smoke is cooled down, it is lighter and when it is lighter it is easier for your lungs to aspirate it.
So a good practice is to put ice in the water phial. You can also try one of those <a href=""https://www.hookah-shisha.com/p-18164-sultana-add-reducer-4-pack.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">water enhancers</a>. Manufactures claim that it empowers the water with special molecular level filtration abilities. I haven't encounter scientific studies remotely related to this product yet, but from using it I can not tell.</p>

<h2>Carbon monoxide and dioxide</h2>

<p>This is what is being produced from the process of burning. It is being released by the charcoal. When smoking cigarettes you are exposed to a direct burning of a tobacco set on fire, which gives you a lot of carbon mono and some dioxide. When you smoke hookah, the shisha does not burn. It bakes. On a temperature of anything around 100C. But, I shall tell you that, the carbon monoxide released from angry lighter coal might exceed that from cigarettes and cigs, mainly because of the duration of your drag. Carbon monoxide might be the least of your problems. It causes dizziness, caused by the blood vessels (arterial) tightening, whereat the heart rate increases to compensate the blood delivery to your brain.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summerize:
Nicotine is in very low levels and density - there is a slight but existing risk of developing cancer and increase of cholesterol levels and even greater risk of addiction. Smoking inside somewhere may lead to a nicotine exposure equal to or greater than that if you were smoking, it depends on the place, its ventilation, air flow and how much people smoke.</p>

<p>The tar is in low levels and density, the more you smoke, the higher levels of it you accumulate. Smoking way too frequent leads to more tar being accumulated, which may damage everything between your mouth and lungs and cause cancer.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide isn't risky - it WILL violate human internal processes.</p>

<p><strong>So it is unhealthy, obviously. Not so unhealthy to lead to death or cause irreversible consequences as such haven't been documented, to my knowledge.</strong></p>

studying more interesting in my opinion)</em></li>

<li><strong>Histopathology:</strong> studies the impaired organisation of    cells and

"A diabetic contact of herpes zoster patient","54","","<p>Should a patient of herpes zoster who successfully take medications for a month (pain and rash disappear) avoid contact with a diabetic patient and what are the precautions when dealing with each other ?</p>
","<p>According to the CDC it depends if the virus is active or not, and they define active as: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CDC also comments on transmission risk of active shingles: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/transmission.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's</a> the CDC info that also includes recommendations for preventing transmission of shingles.</p>

<p>They don't mention any specific precautions (other than the general ones on their site) for diabetics.</p>

"How do steroids work in treating a multiple sclerosis relapse?","54","","<p>I have been trying to find this out with no luck. I understand that they don't affect the long term progression of the disease so don't seem to affect the demyelination, but I'm not sure how they relieve the symptoms during a relapse.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
","<p>Steroids are used as treatment for acute attacks/flares in many diseases because they reduce inflammation. </p>

<p>In multiple sclerosis, they are given to reduce inflammation of the nerves that occurs when the immune system attacks the nervous system. This inflammation may be one mechanism that causes the nerve damage in multiple sclerosis, although this seems to still be a subject of research.</p>

<p>After treating the inflammation, symptoms are reduced and recovery takes less time. However, why, we don't really know yet. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not fully understood how steroids speed up your recovery from a relapse, but they are thought to suppress your immune system so that it no longer attacks the myelin in your central nervous system. They may also help reduce the amount of fluid around any nerve fibre damage.</p>

"How to decide which kind of rice to prefer?","54","","<p>I have the word-of-mouth idea that brown, or at least parboilt rice is nutritionally better for you than white rice. But then I read </p>

<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/407/is-there-any-downside-in-eating-whole-grain-rice-instead-of-white-rice"">Is there any downside in eating whole-grain rice instead of white rice?</a></p>

<p>and there's also the more exotic kinds of rice, like black or red. Now, since I appreciate essentially all kinds of rice (with just a weak preference for Basmati for its taste) - how should I decide which kind of rice to prefer?</p>
","<p>Rice can be primarily distinguished as:</p>

<p>A)polished termed as ""white rice""</p>

<p>B)unpolished(whole)termed as ""brown rice""</p>

<h2><strong>HOW ARE THEY PRODUCED:</strong></h2>

<p>When only the outermost layer of a grain of rice (the husk) is removed, brown rice is produced.</p>

<p>When the next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm,white rice is produced.</p>

<h2><strong>WHY BROWN RICE IS NUTRITIONALLY BETTER THAN WHITE RICE:</strong></h2>

<p>Several vitamins ,dietary minerals and essential fatty acids  are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process.Vitamins lost are-B1,B3 ,traces of vitamin A and E.Minerals lost are iron,magnesium etc.Essential fatty acids in the bran oil and fibres are also lost.</p>

<p>Germinated brown rice is nutritionally better because germination activates various enzymes in the rice, giving rise to a more complete amino acid profile, including GABA.</p>

<h2><strong>MEASURES TAKEN TO IMPROVE WHITE RICE:</strong></h2>

<p>Fortified rice has been produced with the help of biotechnology which is fortified with traces of the lost minerals,vitamins and other substances into the starchy grain matter itself.Such bio fortified white rice may be nutritious.One such is called <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">golden rice</a> which is fortified with added micronutrients.</p>

<p>Another measure is parboiling the rice before polishing.Parboiling helps the minerals and vitamins to be impregnated to some extent into the  starchy grain.</p>

<h2><strong>CONCERNS ABOUT ARSENIC CONTENT OF RICE:</strong></h2>

<p>FIRSTLY,it depends on the type of soil,pesticide used during farming and varies from place to place.
Indeed it possess more threat to people eating brown rice than those eating parboilt, fortified white rice.</p>

<p>SECONDLY several measures are being taken to prevent such casualties.(pls check the reference below)</p>

<p>THIRDLY,researchers have discovered a transporter protein in rice that sequesters arsenic in vacuoles, preventing the toxic element from traveling into grains.</p>

<h2><strong>WHY IS COLOURED RICE GRAIN MORE NUTRITIOUS THAN THE WHITE:</strong></h2>

<p>The genetic colouration of the grain is due to the higher iron,anthocyanin and other antioxidant concentration,absent in white rice.</p>

"Is it safe to get a flu shot when living with an elderly person?","54","","<p>I share a house with a healthy nonagenarian. I know the flu can be dangerous for people of advanced age, so I'm considering getting a flu shot this year.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea? Are there any risks I could pose after being vaccinated? I've heard (anecdotally) that you can be mildly contagious for a brief time.</p>
","<p>There are two types of flu vaccine - inactivated influenza vaccine (which uses 'killed' influenza virus) and live-attenuated vaccine (which uses a more mild virus that should be asymptomatic).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vaccine_safety.htm"">According to the CDC</a>, among the contraindications for the live-attenuated vaccine is: ""Children aged &lt;2 years or adults aged ≥50 years"". This is likely because, as you mentioned, it's possible for you to shed said live virus and infect others, and while the attenuated flu strain <em>should</em> be harmless, it's not a great idea to test that on high risk groups.</p>

<p>The inactivated vaccine carries no such contraindication. It is however something you should certainly bring up with your medical professional.</p>

"Should my tongue literally be pink when I stick it out?","54","","<p>When I stick out my tongue, it is always at least a bit yellow (if my mouth has been really fry for ages, it is totally coated in yellow bacterial stuff).  I don't think I have a major problem with oral hygiene, but I'm wondering what a healthy tongue should look like when stuck out.  Should it basically be pink all the way up, or is it normal to have some yellow coating?</p>
","<p>A tongue may have this appearance due to build up of <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/yellow-tongue/basics/definition/sym-20050595"" rel=""nofollow"">dead cells</a> on the surface.  And then it's worse after not being used as there is no friction from food removing dead cells that might be trapped between the papillae.  Some tooth brushes have another side that can be used to brush the tongue to remove these cells.</p>

"Suffering from Gout problem need help?","54","","<p>I am 17 years old teenager, recently my joint at ankles got swollen, I thought its normal but next day I was unable to walk due pain in joint. So we wentt to Doctor using mine blood reports and in reports mine C-Reactive protein level was 61.7mg/L, Uric acid level was 7.5mg/dl and ESR was 39 mm 1st hr. So he told me that I have gout and prescribed Febutaz 80mg , Pantocid and Acyproxyum ( last two are painkillers while 1st is for reducing uric acid)  also gave diet restrictions (low purine diet) , however after 6th day my swelling was lowered I was still following diet restrictions and medication, but as soon as I head on 10th day swelling again returned ( my painkiller dosage was done before), What do I do? Cuz I have Exam in 2 months and is it enough to treat it? For your information On 8 the day I eat Ladyfinger and Raw pineapple and 7 glasses of water. </p>
","<p>You need to have some synovial fluid drawn from the joint and examined for Crystals. If none are present the condition is not gout. 
Other possible causes of symptoms are psoriatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis septic (infectious arthritis).
The high CRP number indicates an autoimmune condition. </p>

<p>Ask for steroid injection in ankle.
That may give you some relief while you try to adjust your diet to one focused on reducing inflammation.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for other symptoms like skin rashes that are also caused by auto immune inflammation  causing disorders. </p>

<p>I had extreme ankle pain and swelling for 2 months finally got injection. Within a day ankle  was much better.
Has not recurred for 4 months.
But now I have a skin problem diagnosed as psoriasis.</p>

<p>My symptoms began during a high stress time in my life ( death of my sister).
Anything that helps lower stress like meditation, yoga,exercise,healthy foods will help.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
