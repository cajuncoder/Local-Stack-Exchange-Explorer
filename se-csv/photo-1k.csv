"What does STM mean on a Canon lens?","364150","","<p>The <a href=""http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_40mm_f_2_8_stm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon EF 40mm f/2.8</a> has a designation of STM on the lens. What does this mean? What are the advantages of having it and does it replace an older technology?</p>

<p>We have a <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/496/what-do-all-those-cryptic-number-and-letter-codes-in-a-lens-name-mean"">terminology thread</a> that usually covers these questions but this is not yet addressed in it.</p>
","<p>STM stands for <b>St</b>epper <b>M</b>otor and is a applied to a new range of Canon lenses which feature a new design of focus motors which, along with a new iris mechanism are designed to eliminate (auditory) noise during video recording. </p>

<p>Canon haven't revealed any information about how the new design works but it's probably the same type of motor used in mirrorless camera lenses. It's a more precise version of a regular DC motor but still has the same direct connection to the lens focus group, which means manual focus has to be implemented using a <strong>focus-by-wire</strong> arrangement whereby moving the focus ring by hand sends a signal to the motor to move the focus group. </p>

<p>In comparison an ultrasonic motor (like Canon's USM) consists of a pair of concentric rings which vibrate at high frequency to rotate back and forth, an arrangement which permits the user to move the focus ring to directly move the lens element, achieving full time manual focus without damaging the motor.</p>

<p>Stepper motors are better at producing smooth, precise incremental movements, such as those required by contrast detect AF, and AF during video. Ultrasonic motors are better at jumping to the right focus point as part of a phase detection system. See <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/20474/what-is-the-practical-difference-between-phase-detect-and-contrast-based-autofoc"">What is the practical difference between phase-detect and contrast-based autofocus?</a></p>

"How do I convert lens focal length (mm) to x-times optical zoom?","300038","","<p>What is the rule to convert the 'mm' notation to the 'optical zoom' notation? I searched a bit and found this one:</p>

<pre><code>optical zoom = maximum focal length / minimum focal length
</code></pre>

<p>For example a 18-55mm lens would have a 3x optical zoom, and a 18-200mm lens would have a 11x optical zoom. Is that right?</p>
","<p>The ""times zoom"" notation is simply the big number divided by the small one, so the examples you give are correct. <strong>""3x zoom"" simply means the longest focal length is three times the shortest.</strong></p>

<p>This number really isn't very useful, though. On point and shoot cameras, it became popular because the starting focal length was generally about the same across all models — a wide-normal field of view. That makes the times-zoom a reasonable indicator of how far one can zoom in to get a closer view of a distant subject. But with interchangeable lenses, a similar widest angle is rarely the case, so it's not really so useful on its own. <strong>There is no standard ""base"" number that the ""×"" starts from; you go from whatever the widest focal length on that particular lens happens to be.</strong> An 18-55mm and a 70-200mm are both about ""3x zoom"", but a very different range.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the zoom ratio does give you an idea of how much focal length flexibility the lens has, and usually higher numbers are a clue that there will be more compromise on image quality (and/or price, size, and weight). </p>

<p>Photography is a field with a lot of jargon and a lot of numbers to learn. That can be intimidating to would-be photographers who want to concentrate on images, not ""tech stuff"". A simple number, without any metric-system units, is far less intimidating than needing to learn all about <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/103/what-is-focal-length-and-how-does-it-affect-my-photos"">focal length</a> and <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/5917/what-is-angle-of-view-in-photography"">angle of view</a>, so I don't think the marketers are all wrong to focus on this number for basic cameras.</p>

<p>For interchangeable lens cameras, like digital SLRs or mirrorless compact system cameras, in some ways the complexity of using focal lengths is a selling point. Intermediate and advanced users may prefer to be given the straightforward facts instead of having to decode more-removed numbers like <em>times-zoom</em>. In some ways, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1592/why-do-we-talk-about-focal-length-when-frame-sizes-are-different"">giving the angle of view instead of focal length</a> might be preferable, but that hasn't really caught on — probably because it's really not very hard to get a sense for what different focal lengths mean for field of view on your own camera, once you get over the initial learning bump.</p>

"What can be done using a 18-55mm lens?","266948","","<p>I have a Canon EOS 1000D with 18-55mm kit lens (entry level, as many say). Whenever I go out for a shoot, I always end up feeling handicapped because of the limited zoom range.</p>

<p>Most of my friends keep suggesting I get a 'good lens' sometime. I agree on the need for a long range lens, but I am not quite ready to quit on this lens <em>just</em> because of the zoom range. And I am also sure that good photography would still be possible with an 18-55mm lens.</p>

<p>I have tried shooting flowers, close-range portraits, still-life and I liked the photos it gave.</p>

<p>I need pointers about where this lens is most useful. How can I make it work wonders ?</p>
","<p>All <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YH0Li.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>text in blue</strong></a> &lt;- <strong>like this</strong>, is linked to images - whether or not thumbnails are provided.<br>
 Thumbnails are not live linked. </p>

<p>All these things can be done with your kit lens:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn to minimise depth of field in a given situation (max aperture, max zoom, foot zoom to fit) to see how much background defocusing you can achieve. Not an ideal lens for this but results will please you. Try selecting between two objects in mid distance but at different distances. Can you get pleasing differentiation.</p></li>
<li><p>Set lens to minimum aperture. Use tripod or place camera on a wall etc. Take photos at night of street lights etc. Note halo/coma effect. What photos can you [produce using this. </p></li>
<li><p>""Through the bars"": Find some ""bars"" - birdcage etc, put front lens element almost touching bars<br>
(as close as possible). Experiment with what you can achieve.<br>
Can you make the bars vanish? How can you use this ability?<br>
<a href=""http://public.fotki.com/RussellMc/srs/through-the-bars.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Larger version of ""through the bars"" here</strong></a>     / thumbnail below:</p>

<p>This was taken through cage bars. <strong>Can you see them?</strong>

</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3biHu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In both cases this is achieved by placing the lens front element as close to the bars or mesh as you can manage so that they are well inside one focal-length of the lens centre and so are dispersed rather than focused. Your kit lens can achieve this same result allowing to to produce pictures of apparently uncaged beasties or birds or ... .  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Super Macro: Do you have ANY other lenses. Using even an old lens from another camera that does not fit your mount, set spare lens to ""wide open"", invert so front elements of it and yours are adjacent and almost touching. Maybe tape together. Now point at something small and very close and well lit. Note massive macro effect possible. Experiment with focal length setting on each lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Set to small aperture, low ISO. Tripod or brace and photograph falling water and fountains. </p></li>
<li><p>Set to small aperture and low ISO and use flash. Photograph  fountains that have streams of drops or blobs of water in the air. Experiment with flash level and ISO. Be amazed.<br>

"Is camera flash actually harmful to infants or newborns?","256197","","<p>I just got a new off-camera flash, and the instruction manual says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Never fire the flash unit closer than 1 meter from infants.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Can a camera flash harm an infant's eyes?</p>
  
  <p>A: No, it cannot. Actually infants have more protection from a flash than adults since they are usually not interested in being photographed and do not look right at the camera. Also, they typically have smaller pupils. This means less light reaches the retinas. -- Don Bienfang, M.D.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So what's going on here?  Are the makers of the flash just avoiding a lawsuit?  Is this a myth?  Or are the doctors just thinking about little on-camera flashes and neglecting to think about more powerful flashes?</p>

<p>(And if it's NOT a myth, can I assume that bounce flash is acceptable?)</p>
","<p>I think you've answered the question yourself pretty well, with citations and everything. There's little real risk, and the flash manufacturers are erring on the side of caution in order to protect themselves from litigation. To add to the background, here's a quote from the website of a <a href=""https://www.ormc.org/hospital_services/NICU_Parenting_Baby.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neonatal intensive care unit</a> — if there'd be a case where it might matter, presumably at-risk newborns would be the most vulnerable. But they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We encourage you to take pictures of your baby. Flash cameras are allowed and will not harm your baby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For further citation, see <a href=""https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/125560-can-a-camera-flash-really-damage-a-baby-s-eyes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this other Q&amp;A site</a>, where ophthalmologist Dr. Richard Bensinger (a graduate of the highly-regarded Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>In brief</strong>: No effect</em>; the light from a flash is too unfocused and of low intensity that it cannot damage a baby's eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question has other doctors saying the same thing, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Note that neither of these statements are couched in wishy-washy covering-all-bases language, but instead say unequivocally ""<em>no effect</em>"" and ""<em>will not harm your baby</em>"".</strong> </p>

<p>That said, I don't think being flashed right in the eyes with a bright flash is very <em>nice</em>, especially from up close. And I'm not even a baby. Bounce (or otherwise diffused) flash is the way to go for this and for a number of other reasons as well — it's an easy way to provide nicer-looking light and more natural shadows.</p>

<p>Personal notes:</p>

<p>I use Lightroom 4 where I have a custom export with auto image sizing for web set up with compression settings I am happy with. I don't go with the 2048 px because I don't want my online photos to be this large and I upload the same photos to facebook, flickr, 500px and my website so I just found a ""happy"" optimum size which works for me and diplays relatively fast in places that do not have fast internet connection. </p>

<p>My preferred ""HQ"" setting in LR4 is Short Edge: 900 px, resolution 96 PPI, standard screen sharpening.  </p>

<p>It seems to work fine on Facebook. Take a look at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/jakubsisakphotography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>my Fan Page.</strong></a> - all photos there are uploaded with the HQ setting on. </p>

<p>As a side note...
As for the COVER photo, I believe that it needs to be exactly 851x315 and less then 100K in file size.  (I also have an exporter in LR4 set up for just Facebook cover photo with the ""Limit size to 100K"" option set) This ensures crisp sharp cover photo image. I had several cover photos that did not comply with the standard and the cover page looked bad. </p>

<p>Should I convert the images to JPG or TIFF? I know TIFF is higher quality but is it really that much better? Is the difference noticeable?</p>
","<p>These two formats are different:</p>

<h2>JPEG general info</h2>

<ol>
<li>JPEG is used to store images on smaller disk space</li>
<li>JPEG compression algorithm changes image data while converting it. Amount of change can be controlled but not its location which is <em>always</em> around sharp colour changes</li>
<li>JPEG is primarily an RGB format</li>
<li>If you saved and opened the same image several times, you may end up with an unusable image. <strike>because for each save, the compression would generate some additional changes.</strike> Quality of the image should stay fine only if you'll use the same software with each save, <strong>always</strong> use same compression level and maybe just make some local image changes (a tiny portion of the image would get changed). In all other cases image quality will degrade.</li>
<li><strong>But</strong>: Photographic image material is especially well suited for JPEG format, because it contains lots of different colours and nuances. Since JPEG's compression changes these things they become rather <em>invisible</em> in the image. That's why the most prominent parts with JPEG artefacts are very sharp contrast changes as shown in the below image example.</li>
</ol>

<h2>TIFF general info</h2>

<ol>
<li>TIFF is primarily used in press</li>
<li>It's perfectly natural for a TIFF file to save image data in CMYK colour space which is used in press</li>
<li>TIFF can also compress image data but uses an algorithm that doesn't change source data (lossless compression)</li>
<li>TIFF format also supports <em>alpha</em> channel (transparency) which is also relevant in press</li>
<li>If you opened and saved the same TIFF file, you'll end up with exactly the same image as source. Nothing would change in terms of image data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Saving</h2>

<p>If you want your images to stay as true to original as possible I'd rather go with TIFF format (with compression) because I can later open it, manipulate it, etc. and not take the risk that the resulting image (once again saved) would become useless with each save.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Since RGB -> CMYK conversion used to be bad on prepress machines it was perfectly normal to prepare all images in CMYK format and saved in TIFFs. Since I used to do prepress a couple of decades ago I feel natural using TIFF whenever preparing anything for press/print because I can easily control the outcome.</p>

<p>Nowadays these things are more similar yet I'd still rather use TIFF/CMYK because of lossless (saved image is same as original) compression and output control.</p>

<p>You can more or less always tell that a certain image was saved as a JPEG because in areas with strong contrast you can see the JPEG compression artefacts. The stronger the compression the more JPEG <em>noise</em> or artefacts. If you'd use maximum JPEG quality these would be minimized but still not none. So some image is still distorted due to JPEG compression.</p>

<p>This is an example of an exaggerated JPEG artefact. First the original and then the low quality JPEG so you can see the difference.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BNBh5.jpg"" alt=""Artefact free"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1rf5B.jpg"" alt=""Artefact""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>sidenote</strong>: both of these images are JPEGs although the <em>original</em> is saved with maximum JPEG quality (22.5kb) and the bad one uses lowest possible JPEG quality (20.1kb). Size difference would be significant when images are big (or even huge) and contain lots of colours and nuances. But as previously stated, it's harder to see JPEG artefacts in nice gradients than around sharp contrast transitions. And since every lens is more or less soft at pixel level there are less sharp contrast/colour transitions that would enhance JPEG artefacts.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>If you have already maxed out your RAM and storage options, I would then decide which program speed and efficiency are more important to you. For example if you are a much heavier user of Lightroom, I would choose processor over GPU. If you are much heavier user of Photoshop, it is a harder decision, and really gets into the specific processor model and GPU model(which I won't go into here, and would be better suited for superuser.com). If it is a desktop model, I personally would go with the CPU over GPU since it is likely you can upgrade the GPU anyways.</p>

<p>To answer your secondary question, if you are using an older version of Photoshop that does not have heavy requirements on the GPU, you still need a graphics card to handle things like Windows and the actual display on your monitor, it just won't be used by Photoshop to offload the heavy tasks it does with many new features.</p>

<p>The lens doesn't even start to open, doesn't make any sounds of trying even.</p>

<p>What can I do to fix this?</p>
","<p>Lens errors are fairly common. Usually it's sand or grit interfering with the lens extension mechanism. Or the camera's been dropped with the lens extended. Or the camera has been powered on, but the lens had been blocked preventing its extension.</p>

<p>I have written a blog post about <a href=""http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/fixing-lens-error-on-digital-camera.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some things</a> that you can do to try to correct it. They only seem to work for about 50% of lens errors, but they're worth a try. The list includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the batteries and wait a few minutes</li>
<li>Try pressing and holding the Menu, Function, Function Set, or OK while turning on the camera, or otherwise find a ""factory reset"" option.</li>
<li>Try turning the camera on <em>without</em> a memory card inserted</li>
<li>Place the camera flat on its back and turn it on while holding down the autofocus button, to try to cause the camera to attempt autofocus while the lens is extending</li>
<li>Blow compressed air in any gaps around the lens — or use a shop vac</li>
<li>Use a thin piece of paper or a needle to dislodge any visible bits of grit</li>
<li>Gently tap the camera in an attempt to realign jammed mechanics or dislodge particles (obvious warning: could cause further damage)</li>
<li>Gently push or pull the lens barrel, as a last resort (again, potential for further damage).</li>

"How do I set the proper exposure for nighttime moon photos?","127711","","<p>All my attempts to get a good shot of the full moon with my DSLR result in an overexposed circle on a black background.  I've tried using a tripod, remote shutter release, low ISO, and long exposure, but nothing has worked so far.</p>

<p>What combination of ISO and exposure time that will produce good results? </p>

<p>I particularly want to catch a full moon with the reddish effect when it is close to the horizon.</p>
","<p>The moon can be a tricky subject. It is a very bright subject compared to the rest of the night sky. It is also a moving subject, and it moves just fast enough that it can be problematic. Its luminosity changes depending on the time of the month. If you wish to capture any other elements in a scene with the moon, exposure can become fairly complicated. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5cc4R.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The above shot was taken this past November 8th, at about 7pm...a fairly new moon. It was shot with a Canon EOS 450D using the Canon EF 100-400mm L series lens @ 400mm, f/7.1 and ISO 800 for 1/2 of a second. That exposure time was necessary to expose the clouds enough to create a silhouette of the foreground treetops, and not overexpose the moon itself. It was a fairly tricky shot, and in the end part of the crescent did get a little over exposed.</p>

<p>Determining which settings to use boiled down to a maybe two things. What I wanted to compose my scene with, and how much time I had to take the shot. At 400mm, the motion of the moon across the sky is heightened quite a bit, and at most you have about 0.8-1 second before that motion blurs detail. I wanted to expose long enough that the clouds obscuring the moon were bright enough to show silhouettes of the tree tops. I also wanted to get some earthshine on the dark part (a desire that was really pushing it...and, I ended up choosing an exposure that was a bit too high in this case, as 1/4-1/6th of a second would have probably been better, or perhaps ISO 400 rather than ISO 800.)</p>

<p>There is no single correct set of exposure settings that will always expose the moon correctly. Its luminosity depends on a couple factors, primarily its phase, its position in the sky, and what exactly you want to expose (i.e. just the moon, or the moon with some earthshine.) Here is a table of base exposure for digital cameras, assuming an aperture of f/8, based on some of my experience (note that the difference between each phase is not exactly one stop, the scale tends to get skewed a bit as you reach full moon):</p>

<pre><code>Base Aperture: f/8

ISO  | Crescent | Quarter |   Half  |  Gibbous  | Full Moon |
-------------------------------------------------------------
100  |    1/2   |   1/4   |   1/8   |    1/15   |   1/30    |
200  |    1/4   |   1/8   |   1/15  |    1/30   |   1/60    |
400  |    1/8   |   1/15  |   1/30  |    1/60   |   1/125   |
800  |    1/15  |   1/30  |   1/60  |    1/125  |   1/160   |
1600 |    1/30  |   1/60  |   1/125 |    1/160  |   1/300   |
</code></pre>

<p>From that table, it is easy enough to make extrapolations for special scenarios. If you want some earthshine, you will want to expose for longer. I would say that getting even a hint of earthshine requires an exposure around 0.8-1 second. This often blows out the lit part of the moon, so its only really viable with a crescent. </p>

<p>If you want to capture any foreground details, you will usually also want an exposure time of around 1s for silhouettes, or longer for anything else (usually, you will want a double-exposure...one for the moon, one for the foreground.) </p>

<p>Blue moons, orange moons in crescent hung just above the horizon, etc. will all be dimmer than a white moon in the middle of the sky. Slightly longer exposures, maybe by a stop or two, will be necessary to compensate. When it comes to exposing the full moon, however, the reverse tends to be true...shorter exposures by up to a stop may be necessary.</p>

<p>To capture the full moon with that orange glow near the horizon, you will probably want to use the following:</p>

<p><strong>ISO 200, f/8, 1/40-1/50s</strong></p>

<p>Compensate as necessary for any other compositional factors.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I've recently been photographing the moon a lot. Having taken numerous shots of the moon, in its crescent, half, gibbous, and full phases, during eclipses and perigee, I think it is important to make a significant note: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The moon does <strong>not</strong> follow any
  specific pattern, and there are, in
  the end, few rules that you can follow
  to take a good exposure. The table
  above is a good baseline, and can work
  as a starting point, however as you
  expand your efforts and target more
  dramatic moonscapes, exposing the moon
  is much like exposing anything else:
  You need to get a feel for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is a link to a small video I've been working on, a composition of some of my moon photographs and time-lapse videos taken over the last six months:</p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>Time for another update. Given my work week, and the amount of time I have to spend working on my house in one way or another while there is daylight, most of my recent photography has been of the moon. My previous update holds true, however I've learned another useful bit of knowledge regarding moon photography. The moon is a bright, white object. Outside of its crescent phase, it is possible to push exposure VERY far without actually overexposing, even though it may appear overexposed on a camera's live view. (Note: The histogram is not particularly useful when photographing the moon, so use it sparingly and only as a basic guideline.) To demonstrate what is possible with moon exposure, here are some images of the same exposure...one original, and one auto corrected and one manually tuned in lightroom:</p>

<p><strong>Original exposure:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Exposure -> -0.05</li>
<li>Recovery -> 1</li>
<li>Fill Light -> 50</li>
<li>Blacks -> 0</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Manually tweaked for best detail in Lightroom:</strong><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hGHg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">  </p>

<li>Exposure -> -2</li>
<li>Blacks -> 100</li>
<li>Contrast -> 50</li>
<li>Curves:

<ul>
<li>Highlights -> +51</li>
<li>Lights -> -12</li>
<li>Darks -> -14</li>
<li>Shadows -> -44</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sharpening -> 78</li>
</ul>

<p>The original photo was pushed about as far as I could in-camera, such that it appeared as a nearly uniform white disc in my 450D's live view. Lightroom's histogram feature that shows overexposure displayed the following for the original image above:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LOJ6C.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>From the manually tweaked image, you can see that the only ""actual"" overexposure is a small spot just above Tycho crater (bright spot surrounded by a very light gray, lacking any detail.) When it comes to moon photography, excluding crescents, don't be afraid to push exposure. You will capture more detail, with less noise, and corrections during post-processing are quite simple. While it may not look like much in-camera, the amount of detail you can extract from a bright white disc can be astonishing. </p>

"What is the difference between EF and EF-S lenses?","126551","","<p>This is specific to Canon, but what is the difference between EF and EF-S lenses?</p>
","<p>EF-S lenses are specifically designed for APS-C digital bodies and optimized for the fact that they have smaller sensor and mirror. EF-S lenses are marked with a white square on the mount instead of a red dot that EF-glass has, and can be only used on EF-S compatible bodies (almost all of smaller-sensor Canon DSLRs, up to EOS 7D).</p>

<p>Film and larger-sensor digital cameras (5D, 1D, 1Ds) take only EF lenses. If you have a camera with EF-S mount support (such as EOS 7D, 50D or 500D), you can use both EF and EF-S lenses.</p>

"What is aperture, and how does it affect my photographs?","126064","","<p>How does aperture affect my photographs?</p>

<p>Why should I care about the aperture with which a photo was taken?</p>
","<p>The aperture affects not only the amount of time required to take a photo, but also the depth of field within it.</p>

<p>With a wide aperture (so a low number, like f/1.8) gives a shallow depth of field - sometimes less than a millimetre with a macro lens. Because a lot of light is reaching the sensor (be it film or digital), this allows for fast shutter speeds</p>

<p>With a narrow aperture (so a high number like f/22), the depth of field is much greater, which is useful for things like landscape photography - it will limit the amount of light reaching your sensor, so you will get slower shutter speeds, which makes a tripod handy.</p>

"What causes an SD card to go corrupt?","125687","","<p>One of my cheap SD cards goes corrupt from time to time and the camera demands it needs to be reformatted. </p>

<p>It's frustrating, but I want to know what might be the reason that makes it go corrupt and why this might be linked to cost. It can hold close to the advertised capacity of 16gb for months sometimes and other times it gets corrupt after a couple of snaps.</p>
","<p>There are several ways in which an SD card can go bad.</p>

<h1>Physical Damage</h1>

<p>First, cards can be actually physically broken. You can bend them in half pretty easily if you try, but in general they're actually pretty resilient. Many are effectively water-proof even if not marketed that way. I've sent cards through the laundry, and once I dropped one full of precious baby photos right into hot coffee — no problem! Now, I wouldn't recommend pushing your luck, but if you're careful, this is unlikely.</p>

<p>Electrostatic discharge could also damage the electronics, although again most cards are surprisingly well-resistant. (Try to intentionally destroy a card with static and your success rate will be low.)</p>

<p>Flash isn't particularly light-sensitive, so airport x-rays aren't a real risk (longer exposure to high-energy x-rays is another story). It's also surprisingly heat-resistant — the plastic housing is probably at more risk than the memory itself.</p>

<h1>Filesystem and File Corruption</h1>

<p>Physical damage is at the most basic level. At the higher end, you can have corruption and data loss without anything <em>fundamentally</em> going wrong. The firmware in cameras and card readers (that is, the mini-os and software that runs on the device) can make mistakes, or be caught in situations it can't handle.</p>

<p>The most obvious is that you can mess things up if you pull out the card while trying to write to it. Don't do that. (And remember that with caching, that can happen quite a while after you think the data transfer is done.) With SD or Compact Flash cards, it's usually reasonably safe to remove the card from a reader while it's mounted for read access; beware that if you happen to have an xD card device that this is <em>not</em> safe.</p>

<p>A bug could happen in deleting files, or if the card fills up. And, it's theoretically possible that if you format the card on a computer conflicting filesystem bugs will cause issues.</p>

<p>Presuming you avoid the yank-the-card-out scenario, and don't have a hardware failure, these are also pretty rare, because the filesystem implementations used in cameras have been around for a long time and are very well tested.</p>

<p>It's also possible that bad cables, bad USB ports, or problems in the computer itself could corrupt files on transfer. Trying again on another system is always a good first diagnostic.</p>

<p>In all of these cases, the card itself is really fine — reformat and you can use it again.</p>

<h1>Bad Blocks</h1>

<p>Then, there's the SD card <em>really</em> going corrupt.</p>

<p>This happens in two major ways:</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Defects</h2>

<p>There's a lot of pressure to produce small, cheap, high-capacity devices. In order to do this, manufacturers have learned to not worry about perfection, and ship devices with something like 2-5% of the memory <em>already bad</em>, right out of the factory. These initial bad blocks are masked out and shouldn't affect anything, but actually do have a long term effect — see below. </p>

<p>And it's possible that a particular card will have a lot more than it's supposed to, including blocks which weren't properly masked out. This is much more likely with cheap cards.</p>

<h2>Accumulated Failure</h2>

<p>Flash memory inherently has a limited number of write/erase cycles. Inevitably, electrons get trapped where they're not wanted, and the voltage levels shift, eventually causing read or write failure. Any given bit of flash memory is specified for a certain number of cycles before failure, but really it's a random process and there could be a problem long before the numbers would predict on average.</p>

<h2>Coping Mechanisms</h2>

<p>Because these things are inevitable, SD cards are designed to minimize the damage. In addition to the masking out of bad blocks initially, they detect and mask out new bad blocks as they appear. They're made with excess capacity initially, and as blocks wear out, spare blocks are transparently substituted, so everything keeps working. The flash card's built-in controller will use error correction to prevent the errors from corrupting data as they occur.</p>

<p>But, cheaper cards may have less sophisticated error correction, and are likely to have less spare capacity for covering up for bad blocks. </p>

<p>Flash devices also use <em>wear leveling</em>, so that writes are spread across the whole device, not just always using the same area over and over. Here again, cheap cards may do a worse job of this.</p>

<h1>So, Overall...</h1>

<p>It's worth it to buy high-quality name-brand cards because of the inherent issues in the last section. Even then, failure is inevitable (like death and taxes), so don't place all of your eggs in the same basket — make sure you have backups. Other than that, the main advice is to be careful when writes are occurring.</p>

"What does f-stop mean?","125044","","<p>What does f-stop mean? Is it the same thing when people say ""2 stops"" for example?</p>
","<p>An f-stop is kind of a combination of two terms. First off, f/N is generally the notation used to indicate the size of the diaphragm opening, or aperture, in a camera. Let me give a little detail about how that notation came about, before I go on to explain the meaning of a <em>stop</em>.</p>

<h2>Aperture Values and f/Stops</h2>

<p>Aperture openings are measured as fractions of the focal length of a lens. That is what the 'f' stands for in the aperture rating, 'focal length'. Assuming we have the epitome of lenses, the 50mm, with an aperture of f/2.8, we can determine the actual diameter of the aperture opening like so:</p>

<p>50mm / 2.8 = 17.85mm</p>

<p>If we open the aperture up to its maximum of, say, 1.4, we can measure that as well:</p>

<p>50mm / 1.4 = 35.71mm</p>

<p>The difference between an aperture of f/2.8 and an aperture of f/1.4 is a difference of four times as much light...or two <em>stops</em>. We know this because the area of the aperture opening itself is four times as large at f/1.4 (1001.54 mm<sup>2</sup>) as it is at f/2.8 (250.25 mm<sup>2</sup>). A stop in photography nomenclature means a difference of one <em>exposure value</em>, which is the doubling, or halving, of the amount of light reaching the sensor. There are a few standard ""full stops"" that f-numbers are rated in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These aperture settings all differ by one full exposure value, or one full ""stop"", and create the full <code>f-stop scale</code>. When you close down your 50mm f/1.4 lens from its maximum aperture of f/1.4 to an aperture of f/2.8, you are ""stopping down"" by two full stops.</p>

<p>It should be noted that most cameras these days offer a two additional f-stop scales beyond the standard full stop scale: a half-stop scale and a third-stop scale. Most cameras default to a fractional scale rather than the full stop scale, so it is important to learn and memorize the full stop scale so that you are making the proper adjustments when you change your aperture setting on your camera.</p>

<p><strong>Half-stop Aperture Value Scale</strong></p>

<h2>Relationship with Shutter Speed</h2>

<p>An important relationship exists between aperture and shutter speed. Both are rated in stops. While aperture differences are often denoted in 'f/stops', shutter speed changes are usually simply called 'stops', or possibly exposure values. </p>

<p>Back to our example with the 50mm lens. Assuming we are shooting on a bright sunny day, with an ISO of 100. We have the aperture set to f/16, and the shutter speed set to 1/100th. (This is called the ""Sunny 16"" setting, as photographic theory indicates that an f/16 aperture, with a shutter speed matching the ISO speed, will produce a proper exposure in bright midday sunlight.)</p>

<p>Assuming we need to shoot something that is moving very fast, and we need a higher shutter speed. We can easily calculate the proper aperture value, assuming we know how many stops of additional shutter speed we need. If we increase our shutter speed to 1/200th, that is a difference of one whole stop. Shutter speed and aperture are inverses of each other, so if we increase shutter speed by one stop, we must open the aperture by one f/stop, to f/11. Despite the difference from the original settings, the new settings will produce the same exposure. The same applies if you are using a half- or third-stop scale...any half or third stop adjustment of one setting requires an similar inverse adjustment of the other.</p>

"How do I calculate the distance of an object in a photo?","112874","","<p>If I took a picture of a windmill on the horizon — given that I know the sensor size and the focal length of the lens and other factors to do with the shot — could I calculate how far away an object is from the photographer?</p>
","<p>The only other factor you need is the height of the object in real life (otherwise you could be photographing a model which is much closer to the camera).</p>

<p>The maths isn't actually that complex, the ratio of the size of the object on the sensor and the size of the object in real life is the same as the ratio between the focal length and distance to the object.</p>

<p>To work out the size of the object on the sensor, work out it's height in pixels, divide by the image height in pixels and multiply by the physical height of the sensor.</p>

<p>So the whole sum is:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BDistance&space;to&space;object%7D(mm)&space;=&space;%5Cfrac%7Bf(mm)%5Ctimes%5Ctext%7Breal&space;height%7D(mm)%5Ctimes%7B%5Ctext%7Bimage&space;height%7D(pixels)%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7Bobject&space;height%7D(pixels)%5Ctimes%5Ctext%7Bsensor&space;height%7D(mm)%7D"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ajKph.png"" alt=""Distance to object equation""></a></p>

<p>Let's sanity check this equation.</p>

<p>If we keep everything else constant and increase the focal length then the distance increases (as focal length is on the numerator). This is what you would expect, if you have to zoom your lens to make one object the size another equally sized object used to be, the first object must be further away.</p>

<p>If we keep everything else constant and increase the real height of the object then again the distance increases as if two objects of different real heights appear the same height in the image the taller one must be further away.</p>

<p>If we keep everything else constant and increase the image height, then the distance increases, as if two objects (of the same size, remember we're keeping everything else constant) appear the same pixel size in a cropped and uncropped image then the object in the uncropped image must be further away.</p>

<p>If we keep everything else constant and increase the object height in pixels then the distance <em>decreases</em> (we're on the denominator now): two equally sized objects, one takes up more pixels, it must be closer.</p>

<p>Finally if we keep everything else constant and increase sensor size, then distance decreases: two equally sized objects have the same height in pixels when shot with a compact (small sensor, where 20mm is a long lens) and shot with a DSLR (large sensor where 20mm is a wide lens), then the object in the DSLR image must be further away (because it appeared the same size but with a wide lens).</p>

<h2>What to do about mold/fungus in a camera lens?</h2>

<p>by <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/7240/yuttadhammo"">Yuttadhammo</a></p>

<p>I am living in a tropical country where humidity is pretty high.  I never thought it would be possible that something could grow inside a lens, so I haven't been so careful with my canon camcorder.  Now I see there is a white spore growing on the inside of the camera lens (see photo below).  Is there any way, short of finding a camera shop (doubtful there are any in the country that can handle this), to remove this?</p>

<p>The spore is the white dot in the centre (it's opaque), and the dusty patch on the right of the lens is also on the inside, must be the same stuff.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHhCb.jpg"" alt=""fungus spore on lens""></p>
","<p>For all the following:  YMMV*, caveat emptor, no responsibility taken for advice given, you decide whether to try this at home. It may even work :-). Be aware that damage may already be fatal and/or that fatal (to the lens) damage may occur along the way. Best attitude is to regard the lens as a writeoff now, with anything you can gain from it by the methods below being a bonus. </p>

<p>Fungus in a lens will <strong>always</strong> degrade the image <strong>but</strong> the amount of degradation may be invisible to mere mortals or may make the lens completely unusable by any standards. Often even a very visually significant lens defect - such as a chip or scratch, will not be instantly obvious in final images to a casual observer. Experts will usually be able to detect almost any defect (or say they can - mere mortals will not be able to tell if they are correct :-) ). Also, lens settings will affect how much a given defect affects a given image. </p>

<p>In some cases the advice given in 1a and 1b below will transform results from generally unacceptable to generally acceptable. In other cases they won't. Only trying it will tell you how good a method will be.   </p>

<p>The best advice (but too late :-( ) is to never let it happen. Fungus only grows in moist conditions. Keep your lenses in a well ventilated dry location with dessicant sachets. However - </p>

<p>If it's inside the lens there are two options (apart from disposal). Unfortunately, while either may work, neither is certain to work well.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1(a) Shining UV (ultraviolet) light into the lens for an extended period will ""discourage"" the fungus, how well and how long is uncertain. Simply leaving a lens with iris fully open on a sun facing window ledge in a dry location for weeks to months may produce good results. Cap lens at rear, and tilt so that sun shines into lens during sunnier parts of each day. (Be ware that sun shining directly along the axis of the lens or close to it <strong>may</strong> focus light onto end cap and melt it - unlikely but check point and degree of focus.) I tried this procedure with an extremely old Minolta 50mm f1:1.4? manual lens and achieved tolerable results. I simply left the lens as above for many months and when I next looked found that mold presence had been very substantially reduced.</p>

<p>1(b) Light from a <strong>germicidal</strong> (short wavelength) UV lamp may be used in place of sunlight. This sort of light can blind you or damage your eyes permanently if looked at for substantial periods and can cause ""arc eye"" - painful but usually temporary inflammation of the eye. This does not mean you should not use such lights at all - simply that they need to be used with due respect. These lights are available from many sources for many purposes and can be very low cost. </p>

<p>Note that ""black light"" UV light is not suitable for this purpose. It is longer wavelength and not very biologically active. </p>

<p>Note also that the short wavelength high energy UV (which is why you are using it) from germicidal UV lamps will also degrade other materials such as some plastics and miscellaneous other material - including, possibly, parts of a plastic lens housing. This depends on material, distance, light energy and exposure time. YMMV but caveat emptor - ie know that you are using a tool with sharp unguarded blades (even though you can't see them) and use with due caution. </p>

<p>All the above may put some people off UV germicidal lamps. If so, that's good. They are a great and useful tool but not suitable for use by careless or unthinking people. </p></li>
<li><p>2 .  Dismantle and clean. If the lens is so degraded that it is unusable and if the method above does not work well enough then the lens must be dismantled. If the lens is otherwise a 'writeoff"" and you are competent mechanically you may wish to try this yourself. Reassembly of a lens capsule is considered to be an expert task and realignment on reassembly may require arcane knowledge. This is why qualified lens servicing people are still in business and cost money to use. </p>

<p>Fungus often attacks lens surface coatings and may etch the glass itself so the lens may be noticeably or fatally degraded regardless. How much the may/may/may applied in your case is tbd. Some lens cleaning works very well indeed. An aficionado and a good MTR test will probably tell you that something has happened but the results may be very tolerable in practice.</p>

<p>You will find articles on the internet on lens cleaning methods. I read a paper by either Zeiss or Leitz that suggested that cigarette ash makes an excellent fine cleaning compound (!!!).</p></li>

","<p>I don't have Photoshop, but there's an ancient open source project called <a href=""http://refocus-it.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">refocus-it</a> (for iterative refocus), which uses some of the same techniques as Photoshop's new-in-CS6 <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/21077/how-does-photoshop-cs6s-deblur-feature-work"">deblur feature</a>. This should give better results than sharpening with unsharp mask or a high-pass filter.

<p>There are a few weird flat artifacts on the faces, and some clear jaggies around the edge of the flag, but this was a really quick pass. Plus, I'd be surprised if the decades-newer technology in Photoshop can't do a better job. In any case, I think it's at least better than the sharpened result overall. If you don't mind spending a lot of time at it, I might try one approach in one layer and the other in a different layer, and selectively (and softly) erase so  that you get the best result in each area of the photo.</p>

<p>But there are several ways of taking 'selfie' photos:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could set the Hero to timelapse mode, ie taking a photo every
0.5, 1 or 2 seconds. Press the shutter, and it will start taking a series of photos. So you can then get in position for the selfie, and it will get a number of photos of you.</li>
<li>You can do a similar thing in video mode. ie just record a video clip. Then you can get a still photo by taking a snapshot from the video (VLC media player is useful for this). This image won't be as high quality as the photo mode, videos are a bit lower resolution. But probably still good enough for sharing online.</li>
<li>You could use the camera in standard single photo or burst mode, using a remote control to press the shutter. Either the GoPro Wifi Remote, or the GoPro app on a phone or tablet. Though this means you need to have a suitable remote control, and be holding it while you take the selfie.</li>

","<p>Well, Facebook isn't going to handle NEF anyways. However, if you have CS5, that means you have Adobe Bridge and the batch functionality to perform image conversion from there. The short example would be...</p>

<ol>
<li>Open bridge and find an image directory to work on.</li>
<li>Select the images to modify.</li>
<li>Select on the menu: ""Tools -> Photoshop -> Image Processor""</li>
</ol>

<p>This is going to run Photoshop. From there you will be presented with a dialog that provides a number of options for batch processing including using the first image as the basis for further changes, file type to save as, etc. You may want to experiment a little with a small set of images, but be aware that Raw conversion to JPEG is seldom, if ever really, a consistent change. </p>

<p>Personally, I would never do this for final images. I've only ever done it for proof images where I've totally controlled the light used in the shoot, but for anything else, including images I intend for display on the web or in print, the editing is done image by image. This is generally because white balance changes, sharpening changes, and a host of other little tweaks that vary as a result of settings, light, and more.</p>

<p>By the way, if you haven't a lot of Photoshop experience with photographs, I'd recommend Scott Kelby's ""<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321703561"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Adobe Photoshop CS5 Book for Digital Photographers</a>"" as a good place to start (Google if the link doesn't work).

<p>Therefore I would like to know: <strong>which materials are good as diffusers and which materials should I avoid</strong>? Are there any useful rules of thumb in selecting the diffuser (besides experimenting with various materials)?</p>

<p>In particular, if I wanted to actually invest $5 in a diffuser, what kind of material should I buy? I would prefer a paper-like material, something that resembles wax paper or tracing paper.</p>
","<p>The best diffuser I ever found was two-side-matte drafting film (either mylar or acetate). You get excellent diffusion and minimal light loss. The only problems with it are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it burnishes, so you have to be careful with pressure and rubs when transporting or storing it; and</p></li>
<li><p>it's relatively stiff, so there are fewer options when constructing things out of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another good material is frosted window film -- the sort of thing you'd use for privacy. You actually get a couple of different options here: frosted film gives very good, flat diffusion; while something with a micro-beaded texture gives a gradual radial fall-off with hotter highlights. This stuff is available by the foot at any home center.</p>

<p>If you want something that can be thrown casually into a bag without too many consequences, then a translucent white plastic shower curtain is a cheap option. It may be the last thing you want to have hanging in your bathroom, but it's good for photography.</p>

<p>I'd give muslins (beedsheets and so forth) a pass for most applications. Excellent diffusion, but they tend to block too much light. There's not a lot of point saving a couple of bucks on diffusers if you need to make up for it with tens or hundreds worth of more expensive lighting. That being said, it may be worth a trip to a fabric store to buy a couple of yards/metres of a white synthetic -- often they are woven of transparent yarns, and rely on the thread size/texture and weave density to give them the appearance of whiteness. Take a flashlight with you. You need to hit the right store at the right time of year, but you can often pick up something that's just as good as the expensive commercial products at a real bargain price in widths you can't get with paper products or drafting film. But if the fabric is in season or <em>en vogue</em>, it'll be on the pricey side.</p>

"So my iPhone 6 camera lens is as wide as my full frame 35mm DSLR lens?","94052","","<p>I am trying to understand what is the deal with ""full-frame"" and what difference it makes, so did a silly test:</p>

<p>I sat at my bed and aligned the <em>iPhone 6</em> camera with the door of the room and took a picture... then aligned my <em>full frame</em> camera with its prime 35mm lens and took the same shot, and compared the area that is covered in both pics. And actually, the iPhone 6 covered a little more.</p>

<p>So now I am confused. Can someone please explain what is happening? 
Does that mean the room is small, and for that distance the 35mm is acting more of a zoom lens that the iPhone? and if I go outside in an open area and do the test, I can see the difference?</p>
","<p>You're right that the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/5917/what-is-angle-of-view-in-photography"">angle of view</a> of the iPhone camera is a little bit wider than a 35mm lens on a full-frame film camera. Up until this point, you're not really confused. But the part after that, about the small room and zoom and distance — <em>definitely</em> confused. :)</p>

<p>""Zoom"" means the ability to <em>change</em> the field of view — it isn't magnification. See <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/11164/what-is-the-difference-between-a-telephoto-lens-and-a-zoom-lens"">What is the difference between a telephoto lens and a zoom lens?</a> or <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/54190/how-do-zoom-magnification-and-focal-length-relate"">How do zoom, magnification, and focal length relate?</a> for more. Your 35mm prime lens (by definition, since it is a <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1922/what-is-the-definition-of-a-prime-lens"">prime lens</a>) does not zoom, so the angle of view does not change. Moving outdoors won't affect that. The iPhone also has a prime lens, but a smaller one, with a much shorter focal length — but, because the imaging area (the sensor) is also much smaller, the field of view captured is also much smaller — to the point where we call the lenses ""equivalent"" for the different sensor sizes.</p>

<p>Hopefully this diagram will make things more clear:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ni9ZE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ni9ZE.png"" alt=""focal length comparison""></a></p>

<p>Based on the specs I found online the focal length should actually be a little different, but that's just details. The key thing you can see here is that even though the lens and sensor pairs are different sizes, they form (roughly) <strong>equivalent angles</strong>. That means it doesn't matter what you're pointing at — they'll roughly get the same field of view (with, as you observed, the iPhone showing just a little bit more).</p>

<p>Imagine moving the blue line up so that it's at the 4.15mm focal length, same as the red iPhone line. Redraw the blue dotted lines from the edges of that through the point, and you can see that if you somehow used that lens on your bigger sensor, it would result in a <em>very</em> wide angle. (There's an added complication in that the iPhone lens isn't designed to cover that whole full-frame area with its <em>image circle</em>, because it doesn't need to, and in fact it would be practically impossible to make a 4.15mm lens which did, but in the world of <em>theory</em>, that's an entirely separate issue. It's only the part of the image cone which is <em>recorded</em> which matters.)</p>

<p>Or, imagine moving the red line down, using a true 35mm lens with the iPhone sensor. This would result in a very narrow cone.</p>

"Should I buy an original manufacturer battery, or is a generic brand OK?","91744","","<p>I need another LP-E5 type battery for my Canon 450D. Should I buy an original Canon battery or one of the many generic brands available?

<p>I should add that the new battery will be added to my existing Canon battery in a battery grip.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience (good or bad) of using generic batteries?</p>
","<p>One of the easiest choices is to buy brand name batteries. From batch to batch the manufacturer takes quality and performance very seriously. You know and I know that in general there will be no lemons. Generic batteries can be made by any number of manufacturers and they all take on the challenge with different perspectives. And as a result if you were to buy from a e-retailer www.dealextreme.com (which has been selling generic batteries from many manufacturers for years) you'll note that customers leave reviews indicating that one generic marque is better than another. One marque will hold almost as much charge as a Canon/Nikon marque for example.</p>

<p>But because generic battery manufacturers often just copy-cat the design and don't really take special care in being faithful to copying everything, they'll miss something that is non obvious. For example there are several cold weather expeditions to Antartica, mountaineering, and ocean faring where photogs discover generic brands to give out all too quickly, rendering the whole trouble of carrying them moot. They all chimed in wishing they had packed genuine brands. So you can imagine a generic battery maker using thin plastic shields without weather sealing because they could shave off a couple of cents and improve profits--not knowing what they are about to do to some of your most important photographic adventures.</p>

<p>Batteries are also intimately connected to the electronics in your camera, you don't want to be in an uneviable situation where Canon or Nikon disclaim their responsibility to repair your camera because they've discovered that the electronics may be busted due to a generic vertical grip, charger, or battery. That could be quite costly.</p>

<p>But do what you must, and do it smartly. For example, you might have some bust up out of warranty camera you bought at a garage sale and you just need to find some el cheapo battery to go with it. So that you can take out the IR screen of the old busted camera's sensor and do some art projects. No harms done and your wallet won't feel all too much lighter.</p>

Of course I cannot generate new pixel information, only smoothen it etc. so that the pixelation is not so much apparent in full views and prints. Example, one effect popular with photographers is to copy the image into a second layer, set its blending mode to overlay or soft light etc., then apply a blur to it. This somewhat smoothens the image. But it also changes its appearance into a glowy kind of look (which is the aim, usually). </p>

<p>I want a treatment that will fake the appearance of a higher-res smooth image <em>without</em> too many side-effects.</p>

","<p>Taking direct photos of the sun can destroy your camera, not to mention your eyes.

"How to change Shutter Speed and Aperture on Canon T2i?","85857","","<p>I have a Canon T2i and I am having a hard time figuring out how to change the shutter speed and aperture.  I have tried reading the manual but it seems to be a little unclear. Can someone please point me in the right direction? </p>
","<p>For changing the shutter speed, put the mode dial on Tv (as in the image below: make sure the white line corresponds to the letters <em>Tv</em> ), and turn the wheel high-lighted in red below (excuse my crappy images, I edited all this as something quick and dirty).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWN0v.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On your LCD screen, you can see the below screen (let me know if you don't know how to get to this screen). The <strong>1/200</strong> is in seconds - you can go anywhere between 1/4000th of a second to 30 seconds. When you turn the wheel, the number changes, which indicates the change in shutter speed. Make sure you have enough lighting when you choose a very fast shutter speed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hrZ9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>Similarly, for changing the aperture, put the mode dial on Av (as in the image below: make sure the white line corresponds to the letters <em>Av</em> ), and turn the wheel high-lighted in red below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpehp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On your LCD screen, you can see the below screen. The number you see here is actually the denominator (F2.8 actually means f/2.8) For Aperture, the minimum and maximum varies with the lens you have attached. I have a Sigma 18-50 f/2.8-4.5 lens attached on my camera, so you'll see that my aperture is f/2.8. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TjHdY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There is more to the F numbers, but since I don't want to confuse you with all the jargon, I will keep the things simple.</p>

<p>A smaller f number is also called a wide aperture, and a larger f-number is also called a narrow aperture. </p>

<p>The smaller f number like an F.1.8 or F/2.8 is useful when - </p>

<ul>
<li>If you are shooting in low light - the lower F number allows lots of light to enter into the picture, so that will be useful (that is why it's called <em>wide aperture</em>). </li>
<li>If you want a very shallow depth of field (e.g.: foreground in focus, but background blurry - imagine you are taking a picture of a flower, and you want only the flower in focus, and the leaves in background to be out-of-focus).</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose a higher F number like F8 or F11 - </p>

<ul>
<li>If you want small amount of light to enter (that is why it's called <em>narrow aperture</em>) - for now I would say don't worry about this, you can learn more once you become more familiar with photography. </li>
<li>If you want a deep depth of field (e.g.: everything in focus - think of a scenario where you are taking a picture of your friends with a far-way mountain, and you want your friends and also the mountain sharp).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Finally, one thing to keep in mind is the aperture and shutter speed change in effect to one-another. For simplicity (and skipping the jargon), when you select a fast shutter speed, the aperture will change to a higher f-number, and when you select a slow shutter speed, the aperture will change to a smaller f-number.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you select a small f-number (wide aperture), the shutter duration will increase (slower speed), and selecting a high f-number (narrow aperture) will decrease the shutter duration (faster speed).</p>

<p>The IS in the 55-250mm is nothing great and since you have the ISO advantage its worth taking the risk of the 70-300mm and you would have more range too. Don't worry about the lost 55-75 range.

","<p>Like many things when it comes to designing hardware for photography, there are always tradeoffs to be considered and made.</p>

<p>STM lenses sacrifice a little speed in order to be quieter and smoother (no jerky starts and stops). This is important when using Autofocus while recording video.</p>

<p>Lenses with USM focus designs are built for speed first and quiet operation second. Since they are optimized for still images, the jerky starts and stops that help them get there faster are of no consequence.</p>

I like to keep a good quality but it wouldn't make sense to keep a JPG that will be almost as big as the original RAW, so is there any guideline to select a particular JPG quality for particular uses? I am mostly interested in Internet sharing and ordering prints online.</p>
","<p>To be frank, it is <strong>entirely anecdotal</strong> that a JPEG image should be exported at a certain compression level all the time. The amount of JPEG compression should really depend on the usage purpose for the JPEG, and the contents of the JPEG.</p>

<p>The quality level one should choose when exporting an image to JPEG is highly dependent upon the kind of detail contained within the image. An image of a smooth blue sky or a sunset sky with large areas of orange gradient should probably use a high quality setting, 90-100. An image that contains nothing but complex detail could probably get away with a quality setting of 50-60, possibly even lower. There is no single ""best"" JPEG compression setting, and depending on the type and complexity of detail (or lack of complexity and detail), you may find yourself using 40-60, 70-80, or 90-100 as appropriate for the photo(s) you are exporting.</p>

<p>An excellent visual resource for how JPEG compression affects IQ can be found here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/jpeg-quality"">An Analysis of Lightroom JPEG Export Quality Settings</a></p>

<p>This site demonstrates JPEG compression from the lowest to highest settings in discrete ranges for a series of sample images of differing content. You can clearly see, by observing each image at each compression level, why a higher setting such as 90-100 may be required in some cases, and a lower setting such as 40-60 is entirely acceptable for others.</p>

<p>As a side note, if you are saving a JPEG for any kind of print purpose, or for viewing on-screen at a large size (i.e. as a wallpaper for a 30"" 2560x1600 screen), there is no reason not to use the best quality setting available. When saving for web, compress as much as you can without introducing visible compression artifacts. Different classes of images will regularly fall into certain JPEG compression levels (the site linked above can help learning what fall where)...so it can quickly become second nature to know what compression level to use when saving various images for the web.</p>

","<p>As per other answers, it is usually <strong>marked with the ⌀ symbol</strong> on the front and, if not, on the barrel. Some specialty lenses do not accept filters, in which case you won't find any markings.</p>

<p><strong>For your lens, <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/lens.php?id=169"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the thread is 67mm</a></strong></p>

A step-up ring costs about $12, so if you buy 77mm filters and have a 58mm, 67mm and 77mm lens, you need 2 step-up rings: 58->77 and 67->77.

<p>Please talk to me like I'm stupid. :) I am hoping for a completely lay explanation.  In particular, I'd like to understand in what situations I'd use a telephoto lens, and in what (other) situations I'd use a zoom lens.</p>
","<p>The focal length of a lens determines its field of view on your camera. If it has a long focal length, it has a narrow field of view, making the things in front of you appear large in the photograph. If it has a short focal length, it has a large field of view--it's a ""wide angle"" lens that takes in a large area, making objects appear small.</p>

<p>A ""zoom lens"" is a lens whose focal length can change. You twist the barrel, or push a switch on the camera, and it takes in a narrower or wider field of view, making objects appear bigger or smaller.</p>

<p>The term ""telephoto lens"" has a particular technical meaning in terms of lens design, but in common usage it refers to a lens with a long focal length.</p>

<p>A zoom lens could ""zoom"" from a short (wide-angle) to long (""telephoto"") focal length, making things look bigger and closer as you zoom in. Or it could zoom from an extreme wide-angle to a moderate wide-angle, never coming close to a ""telephoto"" focal length. Or any other range of focal lengths.</p>

<p>So ""zoom"" = focal length you can change, and ""telephoto"" = long focal length. A lens can be one, or the other, or neither, or both.</p>

<p>The focal length is normally measured in millimeters (mm). A zoom lens will have two measurements, for example ""18-200 mm"" (a wide-angle to telephoto zoom). It zooms from a short focal length of 18 mm to a long focal length of 200 mm. A non-zoom lens, also called a ""prime"" lens, will have a single focal length, for example ""135 mm"" (a moderate telephoto).</p>

"What's the difference between cross-type autofocus points and regular ones?","81191","","<p>What's the difference between different autofocus point types (cross vs point and such)?  Cross points seem to be a ""feature"" — why?</p>
","<p>Phase-detect autofocus sensors are basically tiny, simple rangefinders — light from each side of the lens is split into two paths, and the two paths are projected onto small linear sensors. The difference between the pattern of light and dark is analyzed, and the amount of front or back focus instantly calculated. (That's why phase-detect autofocus is so much faster than contrast-detection as implemented in most point &amp; shoot cameras — with that, the lens has to seek back and forth to find the point of most contrast.)</p>

<p>If you've used a manual-focus camera with a split-prism in the center of the focusing screen, you can recognize same basic principle at work. As with that, the pattern you're focusing on has to be conveniently aligned against the direction of the split prism for it to be of any use.</p>

<p>A cross-type sensor is simply two linear sensors crossing each other (making a cross shape), which is superior because it can work with both vertical and horizontal light patterns.</p>

<p>In manual split-prism focus aids, it's common to align the split <em>diagonally</em>. This conveniently works with both horizontal and vertical lines/patterns. Some Canon cameras use a diagonal cross for their center sensor. There's other possibilities as well: the Sony A700 uses multiple crossed sensors in a # hash configuration.</p>

<p>Apparently some high-end SLRs use a rectangular autofocus sensor which basically is a small, low-resolution copy of the whole image — more like focusing with a real rangefinder camera, automatically. (Wikipedia tells me this is called ""Area SIR"", for ""area secondary image registration"".) That's out of <em>my</em> price range, though.</p>

<p>And, it's worth noting that different sensors can have different sensitivities — more sensitive ones work more precisely at wider apertures, with the trade-off being that they don't work as well with lenses limited to slower apertures. That's covered by <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/16266/why-does-canon-limit-or-disable-autofocus-below-certain-f-numbers/16270#16270"">a whole different question and answer</a>.</p>

"Why am I getting black photos when I use the Manual feature on my DSLR?","80107","","<p>I was taking photos a few days ago, and I had it set to Manual. After about four photos, the rest started coming out black. I could see through my eyepiece clearly, and it took the photo normally, but when I reviewed it they were all black. </p>
","<p>""Manual"" means that it is up to you to set the correct exposure.  It's conspicuous that you didn't mention what exposure settings you were using, so I'm not sure that you realize that you have to do that yourself.</p>

<p>DSLRs have light meters in the viewfinder which show how over/under-exposed your manual settings are, according to the auto-exposure system.  On Nikon cameras it shows up as a bar:</p>

<pre><code>+        0        -
&lt;--|--|--|--|--|--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the meter is in the middle, then the autoexposure system considers the picture correctly exposed.  If the meter is to the left, it is overexposed, and to the right, it is underexposed.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no point in using manual if you blindly follow the autoexposure system's recommendations.  But if the meter shows severe underexposure, then you're probably underexposing the image and will get a black image.</p>

<p>Increase the aperture or decrease the shutter speed, or switch to an automatic mode (such as P, S, or A).</p>

"What is back-focusing?","79905","","<p>What is back-focusing? Is it something I need to be worried about, or can I just live with it? How can I tell if my camera/lens is sufferring from it?</p>
","<p>Back-focusing and front-focusing is when the auto-focus consistently is slightly off in either direction.</p>

<p>This problem has always existed as long as auto-focus has existed, but it has come into focus (no pun intended) with digital cameras where you can enlarge the image to pixel level and really see where the focus is.</p>

<p>You can test this with a simple setup of a ruler and a box of matches, or any similar objects. Put the ruler on a table and place the box standing right beside it. Focus on the box and take a picture, preferrably using a long lens and the largest possible aperture (lowest f-stop value).</p>

<pre><code>box -&gt; |                         o &lt;- camera
       |
--------------- &lt;-ruler
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you examine the photo you can see where the ruler is sharp. If the auto-focus is correct, the box is in focus, and the part of the ruler that is sharp is a section in front of and behind the box, centered slightly behind the front of the box. That is because the depth of focus is slightly longer behind the subject:</p>

<pre><code>box -&gt; |

<p>Does it depend on the camera?</p>

<p>There's lots of conflicting information out on the web; I'm hoping Photo-SE can provide some reliable info.</p>
","<p>USB 1.1/2.0 specifies a maximum cable length of 5 meters (~16 feet) as a function of a minimum required transmission speeds. That's pushing the limit, to some degree, and will be highly dependent on how well the cable is made, shielding, etc. If you're worried about reliability, I would go under that, probably no more than 3 meters (~10 feet).</p>

<p>USB 3.0 doesn't actually specify a maximum length, but we're still talking copper here generally, and so the maximum practical length is probably around 3 meters to meet the speed requirements, so on USB 3.0, I'd go less than that again, maybe 2 meters (~6.5 feet).</p>

<p>My source for this is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_2.0#Maximum_Cable_Length"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> which is usually pretty good at explaining standards items. In this regards, I'd probably trust them. In any case, 10 feet is a pretty decent cable length, but if you need much longer, you can also get USB repeaters, bearing in mind that you often get what you pay for with these.</p>

<p>So, in general, I think the limiter is most likely associated with cable quality as opposed to the camera. If the camera is truly specified to the USB 2.0 standard, going with a good cable smaller than the maximum, should be more than fine and use of a good repeater can help in extending that length as you need.</p>

"What is the difference between Nikkor D type and G type lenses?","76712","","<p>I recently bought a Nikon D5100. And along with this camera, I got the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens as kit. It's ""G"" type lens, right?</p>

<p>Main thing is I'm confused about what these ""G"" and ""D"" type lens means. I know it's a common question but I didn't find any solid answer.</p>
","<p>Here is the description from Nikon's own web site:</p>

<p><strong>D-Type NIKKOR Lenses</strong>
A D-type lens relays subject-to-camera-distance information to Nikon D-SLRs that feature 3D Color Matrix Metering (all versions), 3D Matrix Metering, 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash and i-TTL Balanced Fill-Flash. Many D-Type lenses have an aperture control ring and can be used on older Nikon SLR cameras that allow for manual control of the aperture, as well as on D-SLRs—especially useful for adjusting aperture while recording D-Movies on higher end models. When used on a D-SLR, the aperture control ring needs to be locked at the smallest possible aperture (generally designated in orange), and the aperture control is maintained through the camera's command dial</p>

<p><strong>G-Type NIKKOR Lenses</strong>
A G-type lens does not have an aperture control ring and are intended for use on Nikon D-SLRs that allow the lens aperture to be adjusted via the camera's command dial. Because G-type lenses relay subject-to-camera-distance information to the camera, where it is used to help determine ambient and flash exposure, they are also considered to be D-type lenses. The lack of an aperture control ring is perhaps the easiest way that you can tell if a lens is a G-Type NIKKOR or not. [The AF-S NIKKOR 24-120mm f/4G ED VR lens, shown above is an example of a G-Type lens. Note there is no aperture ring on that version of the lens, while there is an aperture ring on the AF version, above right.]</p>

<p>I don't have the manual for this lens but am just wondering if anyone knows what the issue is here.</p>

<p>My camera is a Nikon D70S.</p>
","<p>Lenses with the aperture ring were originally designed for older SLR's which did not control aperture via the camera body. </p>

<p>Newer SLRs and DSLR control aperture via the body, so these older lenses must be stopped all the way down in order to be used. Your lens is working as it should, and is not defective. </p>

<p>To select aperture using your camera, ensure the aperture ring is set at 22 and shoot in either aperture (A) priority or manual and use the command dial and LCD screen to select the aperture you desire.</p>

<li>Are there any major downsides to this solution ?  </li>
<li>I suppose that the camera has to be connected to a computer through its USB interface.  Any danger for the camera's battery ?</li>
<li>A word about the final quality of that kind of solution ? </li>
</ul>
","<p>You can use the software ""EOS Utility"" that comes with the camera. The remote shooting function lets you do time lapse through a connected USB cable.</p>

<p>Advantage:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have the space of the PC hard disk instead of the flashcard, which is most likely much larger. That is great if you take really long time lapses.</li>
<li>You can also see better what is happening and change settings, focus etc. If you take images with the intervalometer or magic lantern, you have to stop the time lapse first, check the images, then restart it. Specially over longer time lapses, the lens will unfocus unless you tape it in place. If you can look anytime at the current images, you can fix the focus if necessary while doing the shooting. With other solutions you have to look through the viewfinder and try to see the focus there.</li>
<li>You do not have to work with alternative firmware, which is daunting for some people, as when you use magic lantern.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantage:</p>

<ul>
<li>You cannot take as fast sequenced images. I think the maximum speed is one shot every 10 seconds since the data has to be transferred through the cable between every shot (I guess). With an intervalometer you can go much faster (every second I think).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other points:</p>

<ul>
<li>In both cases, with software and intervalometer, you might need extra battery support.</li>
<li>There is no worry for your battery to connect the USB cable, since the USB cable does not try to charge your camera.</li>
<li>Final image quality in general is the same, except for the point that you can readjust focus when using a cable much easier.</li>

"What is Rembrandt lighting, and when do I use It?","74336","","<p>I often hear studio photographers talk about 'Rembrandt Lighting' when they're setting up lights and doing studio portrait photography. What is Rembrandt Lighting, and when do I use it?</p>
","<p><strong>What is Rembrandt Lighting?</strong></p>

<p>Rembrandt Lighting is one of the 5 basic lighting setups used in studio portrait photography. There are two things that make up Rembrandt Lighting… A light on one half the face, and a triangle of light on the shadowed side of the face (called a chiaroscuro, but only lighting nerds need to remember that… most of us just call it ‘the triangle shadow’). If it’s ‘real’ Rembrandt lighting, the triangle shadow should be no wider than the eye, and no longer than the nose. The thing that distinguishes Rembrandt Lighting from simple short lighting is the triangle of light (also see '<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6495/in-portrait-photography-what-is-broad-lighting-what-is-short-lighting"">In portrait photography, what is 'broad' lighting? What is 'short' lighting</a>'). That’s the technical…</p>

<p>In the real world, when it comes to portrait photography, Rembrandt Lighting is often confused with Short Lighting and is used as loose shorthand for ‘using a single light source to light roughly half the face, while leaving the other half of the face in some level of shadow.’ This is because it can often be quite 'fiddly' to get the triangle of light just right on a subject.</p>

<p>Rembrandt lighting at its most basic level is constructed with a  single light source placed approximately 45 degrees offset from the subject and a bit higher than eye level, lighting the side of the face that is farthest from the camera. </p>

<p><em>One-light Rembrandt Lighting setup:</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7n75A.jpg"" alt=""Basic one-light Rembrandt Lighting setup diagram"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fk9D4.jpg"" alt=""Basic one-light Rembrandt Lighting setup example""></p>

<p>Often times the single light source is augmented with a reflector or another light placed approximately 45 degrees offset to the shadowed side of the face and at ½ the power of the main light source (called the key light). This is used to lighten the shadows on the dark side of the face.</p>

<p><em>One-light with reflector Rembrandt Lighting setup:</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/st4cY.jpg"" alt=""Basic one-light Rembrandt Lighting setup with reflector diagram"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/prEC1.jpg"" alt=""Basic one-light Rembrandt Lighting setup with reflector example""></p>

<p><strong>When do I use Rembrandt Lighting?</strong></p>

<p>One of the reasons many photographers use Rembrandt Lighting is that it is relatively simple to set up, and requires only a single light source (though it’s often supplemented with a reflector in order to bring detail back into the shadows on the subject’s face). This lighting pattern works well for subjects will full or round faces (because it adds definition and slims the face), but is generally not a good choice for narrow faces. Often times ‘old school’ photographers will refer to Rembrandt Lighting as ‘masculine’ and some <em>really</em> old school portrait photographers will insist that a woman should never be lit with Rembrandt Lighting. This seems to be a relatively arbitrary distinction, however, and since Rembrandt himself painted women using basic Rembrandt Lighting, it’s safe to say that this ‘rule’ is a ‘guideline’ at best, and is something that many photographers regularly ignore.</p>

<p>Also, what are the advantages/disadvantages of both?</p>
","<p>Nowadays, both terms are using interchangeably because the vast majority of SLRs in production are digital and there was not been a new model of another type of SLR in years.</p>

<p><strong>SLR</strong> refers to a camera with a <strong>Single Lens</strong> and a <strong>Reflex</strong> mirror to bend the light path to the optical viewfinder for framing. A <strong>DSLR</strong> is a <strong>Digital</strong> SLR, meaning it has a digital sensor to record images.</p>

<p><strong>Digital SLRs have may advantages compared to their film counter-parts.</strong> You get the digital workflow with instead previews and low usage costs. Taking thousands of images is easy with a digital. On the other hand, each roll of film costs money takes space and most be properly kept until developed (and after too).</p>

<p><strong>Film SLRs have advantages</strong> and can be far more durable and resistant to extreme environments. They require much less care and batteries last for years. Some do not even need batteries to operate, although you loose metering and autofocus obviously. They are not prone to sensor-dust (or film-dust) because a new frame is used for each shot.</p>

<p>Advances mean that <strong>image quality greatly favors digital cameras</strong> which now have over 14 stops of dynamic-range and reach stellar ISO sensitivities as high as 204,800. With resolutions reaching 36 MP too, they can capture a tremendous amount of details.</p>

<p>When DSLRs had around 6 MP people would argue which one captures more details but I have not seen anyone argue about it anymore. Of course, with a film camera, it depends on the film used and the resolution is actually not a uniform grid, so highlights get more resolution and shadows less.</p>

","<p>Due to <em>Intellectual Property</em> constraints, most notebook or laptop computers as well as desktop models do not have an HDMI port that allows video signals to be brought in via the HDMI port. It is an output only port. This prevents someone from being able to connect a DVD or BlueRay player to their computer and copy protected content. In general the only devices that can accept an HDMI signal and display it are televisions and monitors.</p>

<p>If you are trying to connect your D600 to an HDMI monitor or TV via the camera's USB port using a cable designed for an MHL compliant USB port (such as many mobile phones use to output video to a screen) it will not work since the USB port on your D600 is not MHL compliant. Use a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable to connect the mini-HDMI port on your camera to the HDMI port on a television or monitor.</p>

<p>If you want to shoot with your camera connected to a laptop to view your work as you shoot, you need to use a <em>tethering</em> capable <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/632/15871"">application</a> on your computer and connect the D600 to the computer via a mini-USB to USB cable.

"What is moiré? How can we avoid it?","69857","","<p>What is the image defect called ""moiré""? What causes it, and how can we avoid or reduce it? Is it related to ""false color""?</p>
","<p>Moiré is a form of aliasing whereby false patterns can be observed in an image.</p>

<p>Imagine a lighthouse which sends a pulse of light every 5 seconds, and a camera (or other observer) which sees the lighthouse for three seconds and is then blocked from seeing it for three seconds:</p>

<pre><code>lighthouse:        *....*....*....*....*....*....*....*...
observer:          ***...***...***...***...***...***...***

observed pattern:  *...................*....*....*........
</code></pre>

<p>What is actually a regular pulsing is observed as a highly uneven pattern due to temporal aliasing, caused by the sampling frequency being close to but different from the frequency of the phenomenon being observed. This is why wagon wheels can appear to spin backwards when observed with a movie camera with fixed framerate.</p>

<p>Moiré is exactly the same phenomenon but is an example of spatial rather than temporal aliasing. When a regular pattern of light and dark like a manmade fibre cloth is imaged by a sensor with a fixed pattern of pixels the evenness of the fibres gives way to an artificial pattern at a much lower frequency (more widely spaced):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QzBdd.jpg"" alt=""Moiré on parrot feathers""></p>

<p>Image by Fir0002/Flagstaffotos. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:GNU_Free_Documentation_License"" rel=""noreferrer"">License</a></p>

<p>Aliasing is at its worst when the frequency of the pattern is close to the sampling frequency (the density of pixels in the sensor). Low frequency patterns aren't a problem. An anti-aliasing filter blurs the image therefore reducing the frequency of the input and chance of aliasing. The downside is that this also blurs non-repeating patterns which would not cause noticeable aliasing.</p>

<p>Instead of reducing the image frequency by blurring, aliasing can also be mitigating by increasing the sampling frequency, i.e. having more megapixels (without increasing sensor size or lens sharpness). Digital medium format cameras have lots of megapixels but still suffer from aliasing due to sharper lenses. </p>

<p>Anti-aliasing filters are fitted to almost all 35mm DSLR sensors as standard. They can be removed; I know of one company that does this: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.maxmax.com/hot_rod_visible.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.maxmax.com/hot_rod_visible.htm</a></p>

<p>The advantage is greater sharpness but more moiré. If you only shoot random natural textures then this is probably a good idea. Some digital MF cameras and backs lack an AA filter. Opinion is divided on why, given how bad aliasing can be on fabrics and the fact the MF is frequently used for fashion. My view is that these images are probably shot at f/32–f/45 with giant lighting power packs, and the diffraction acts as an AA filter.</p>

<p>Moiré can be reduced in software, but only to an extent, it's usually much better to use an AA filter. You can get screw-on anti-alias filters for lenses if your sensor lacks an AA filter.</p>

<hr>

<p>Moiré is related to false colour due to the demosiacing process. As (most) digital sensors are monochrome devices, alternating colour filters are placed over each pixel and the colours interpolated to produce a full colour image. When observing a high frequency monochrome pattern, adjacent pixels with different colour filters may see peaks and troughs in the signal respectively, and this can be (falsely) interpreted as different colours being present in the input.</p>

"How can I see the number of shutter actuations for my Canon EOS 350D?","69755","","<p>I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT (otherwise known as the EOS 350D). I'd like to find the number of shutter actuations.</p>

<p>I have tried ExifTool, and the ShutterCount is not part Exif information for a Rebel. FileNumber is though. For one of my latest .jpg files, the FileNumber was 425-2556. Does that mean I've used 4 million files? If I took 1000 pictures a day for a year, that would be 365,000 files. So 4 million files would be over 10 years worth.</p>

<p>I have used before <a href=""http://astrojargon.net/EOSInfo.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EOSInfo Utility</a> but I am afraid it only supports 40D, 50D, 450D, 500D, 1000D and 5DmkII.

<blockquote>
  <p>The shutter count information is available <em>only</em> on Canon DIGIC III/IV DSLRs <em>except</em> the 1D* series. This means that EOSInfo will display the shutter counter for the 40D, the 50D, the 450D, 500D, and the 1000D. It will also show the shutter counter for the 5DMkII, but the camera must be power-cycled before the value is updated. The shutter counter will not be displayed (or will be displayed as ""0"") on the 1D*, 5D, 10D, 20D, 30D, 300D, 350D, and 400D.  It's not that I have anything against the owners of those cameras, but simply that the Canon SDK does not support retrieving the shutter count for them. UPDATE (08/06/2009): Apparently, Canon has removed the facility for checking the shutter count on the 500D. More news when I learn something.</p>

"What is an easy way to remember the full stop scale?","69672","","<p>If you were teaching someone new to photography the full stop scales, is there a better way then flat out memorizing these values? Does anyone have an easy way that they remember the scale? Would it make more sense as a type of mathematical equation without getting overly complex?</p>

<p>Aperture Full Stops:</p>

<pre><code>1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64
</code></pre>

<p>Shutter Full Stops:</p>

<pre><code>1/1000s, 1/500s, 1/250s, 1/125s, 1/60s, 1/30s, 1/15s, 1/8s, 1/4s, 1/2s, 1s
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the shutter stop scale is very easy to remember, but how can I use the square root to determine the aperture easily in my head?</p>
","<p>F-stops deal with doubling/halving the amount of light hitting the sensor. Everything revolves around twos.</p>

<p>With the shutter speed, it's easy to understand, as you say. Every shutter f-stop is (roughly) half/double the amount of time as the previous one. Personally, I don't even bother paying attention to the numerator (""1/"") part of the shutter speed; I've drilled it into my head that bigger denominator = faster = less light = darker exposure.</p>

<p>Note that shutter speeds aren't <em>exactly</em> doubles/halves. I think that this is just because manufacturers think people like to see ""round"" numbers. At the fast end, that means 1000, 500, 250. At the slow end, you need more accuracy, so you have true halving of speed (1, 2, 4, 8). Then, they have to make the numbers meet in the middle, so they start to fudge the numbers a bit (15 is almost 8 * 2, 125 is almost 60 * 2). (I'm a programmer, so personally, I'm fine with seeing a shutter speed of 1/1024s :-) )</p>

<p>Aperture is a bit trickier. Double the light means doubling the area of the aperture, which is where the squares/roots come into play (Area of a circle = pi * r^2). That's a pain to mentally calculate, but there is an easier trick to consider: every <em>two</em> stops represents a doubling (or halving) of the aperture's f-number:</p>

<pre><code>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
</code></pre>

<p>If you know those, then you can guesstimate the in-between stops by calculating <em>slightly less than the average</em> of the surrounding f-stops:</p>

<pre><code>1.5 -&gt; 1.4, 3 -&gt; 2.8, 6 -&gt; 5.6, 12 -&gt; 11, 24 -&gt; 22, 48 -&gt; 45.
</code></pre>

<p>As with shutter speed, bigger number = smaller aperture = less light = darker exposure.</p>

<p>Something similar happens with ISO. Each doubling of the ISO value represents a stop, which you can trade off (with consequences) with stops of shutter and aperture. Note that this transition is reversed though: bigger number = more sensitive = <em>more</em> light = <em>brighter</em> exposure. The common ISOs are:</p>

<pre><code>50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800
</code></pre>

<p>And just to be complete, there's another similar scale with flash power:</p>

<pre><code>1 (Full power), 1/2 power, 1/4 power, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128
</code></pre>

<p>This is very much like shutter: bigger denominators (forget the numerators) = less power = less light = darker exposure. (Note that true powers of two is fine here).</p>

<p>Honestly though, I don't bother with any of these mnemonics myself. I usually do ""three clicks of my control wheels on my camera"" when I want to go up/down one stop. (My camera, and many others, set one click of the control wheel to be 1/3 of a stop.) The absolute numbers aren't usually as important as the amount of change relative to ""where you are now"".</p>

<p>I don't want the spec of the lens which I already know but is there anyone here who actually owns those lenses and is happy with the quality of 24-70 f/4 over 24-105 f/4? i.e. is it worth paying extra for 24-70 f4 over much cheaper 24-105 f/4?</p>

<p>[Update]</p>

<p>I went with 24-70 f2.8 II and been very happy ever since. </p>
","<p>If you are doing weddings, the extra stop of an f/2.8 lens is almost essential when shooting in churches that don't allow the use of flash. For about the same price as the EF 24-70mm f/4, you can buy a Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC. The reviews I have seen place it between the original EF 24-70mm f/2.8L and the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II in terms of sharpness. The Tamron, unlike both of the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 versions, also has Vibration Compensation (VC) which is equivalent to Image Stabilization (IS) in Canon nomenclature.</p>

<p>The only real advantage of the EF 24-70mm f/4L IS over the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS is the much shorter minimum focal distance that is useful for close photography of smaller objects. It is not a true macro lens, but with a maximum magnification of 0.70X, it is a lot closer than the other 24-70mm lenses and the 24-105mm.</p>

<p>Compared to the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS in terms of sharpness the EF 24-70mm f/4L IS is sharper at 24mm (most notably on the edges), less sharp at 50mm, and only slightly less sharp at 70mm when the aperture is set at f/4 on both lenses.</p>

<p>If you will use it more for the wide angle end, get the EF 24-70mm f/4L IS. If you will use it more on the longer end get the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS. If you are serious about doing weddings, get one of the 24-70mm f/2.8 lenses.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like tips both for the photography part of this and for post-processing.  For example, I'd imagine I want to shoot manual w/ the same exposure for all shots (as with a panorama), but I'm not sure if there are any other helpful tips for taking the shots.  At one point, for example, I thought I'd have to tripod-mount the camera and keep the same framing for all shots, but I've now seen several examples where the composition moved from shot-to-shot.</p>

<p>I'm also interested in recommendations for post-processing -- software, technique, etc.  I can envision a manual process where I stack layers and align them by hand in Photoshop Express, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't a better way — maybe using a pano tool like Hugin.</p>
","<p>Everything that applies to shooting a panorama applies to shooting one of these. A tripod makes assembling more convenient but means you can't pan to follow the action. It's important to rotate the camera and not move your feet in order to make sure the shots line up. Locking the focus is going to be necessary. Same with shutter/aperture.</p>

<p>I've only done one of these, it could have been shot on a tripod but the location didn't allow it! I loaded the images in Photoshop, auto-aligned and then manually masked the overlap areas, this was quite easy as the frames are just the right distance apart to minimise overlap. A bit of overlap adds to the effect, too much can make it hard to see what going on.</p>

"What is the purpose of a dual LED flash?","66797","","<p>I see that some smartphones now have dual LED flash.</p>

<p><strong>What exactly is the purpose of a dual LED flash?</strong> Anything to do with brightness? What can a dual do that a single flash cannot? Would a triple LED flash be a possibility even?</p>
","<p>The distance from which you can light subjects with a flash is proportional to square root of luminous power due to the <a href=""http://www.geofflawrence.com/photography_tutorial_inverse_square_law.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inverse square law</a>. A dual LED flash can emit twice as much light as a single LED of the same type, which means you can lit subjects 1.4 times further away. It also draws twice as much power.</p>

<p>A triple LED flash would increase your reach 1.7 times compared to a single LED (1.2 times compared to dual LED). So the difference is not as significant as when stepping from single to dual, but increase of manufacturing costs and power drain is similar. Triple LED flash is not unheard of - Pentax Optio W90 uses three LEDs to aid during macro shots. As they are placed triangularly around the lens, they effectively create a ring light effect.</p>

<p>Generally, if you need more light than a dual flash, you'll be happier with a Xenon flash. A Xenon flash would also let you add regular speedlights off-camera in optical slave mode, but cannot act as a continuous video light / torch.</p>

<p>In iPhone 5s (and hopefully, its successors) the two LEDs are of different color (amber and white). By adjusting their ratio, the camera can adjust color of the flash to match what been  determined to be the white balance of ambient light. Traditionally, photographers have had to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/946/4390"">use gels</a> to obtain similar match between flash and ambient light. </p>

<p>Such color adjustment is intended to reduce washed out look of flash photographs. There are actually two factors contributing to the washed out look - mismatched white balance and on-camera axis of the light. Dual flash fixes only the first of them; axis still remains unnatural for those of us who don't walk around daily with a head lamp (unlike miners). The axis could be fixed by bouncing the flash from a nearby surface, but this is where illumination power falls short for even a dual LED flash, even if there was a reasonable way to direct the light. </p>

<p>To my surprise the printed picture looked very different from what I see in the computer monitor. Can anyone tell me how can the colors look so different? Basically, they have lost their saturation and in some cases the yellows are orange etc. Also, do I need to look for anything in particular in a printer that I am planning to buy? Are printers for photographs different from regular printers? </p>
","<p>Color laser printers, especially the big high end office printers, have the color capabilities you need for printing the company logo and the occasional Excel pie chart — but they are truly bad for printing photos.</p>

<p>But the good news is that almost any of the current generation of ink jet printers, even the cheap ones, are pretty good at printing photos - but only if you print in the printer's high quality setting on photo paper, if you use the cheap office paper you will get the same desaturated colors you got at the office.</p>

<p>Now, the colors in print will never be the same as on screen, especially the brightness (because the screen is a light source and he paper isn't) but you can get good results results, here are the options depending on how accurate you want the colors to be:</p>

<p><strong>1. Just print in high quality on photo paper</strong></p>

<p>If you like the way colors look an screen right out of camera and you never calibrated your screen than it's likely you won't notice the problem from uncalibrated printer (but it will never be the same as on screen).</p>

<p>This should be good enough for most people and will probably match the results you get when you get the photos printed in cheap labs. </p>

<p><strong>2. Calibrate your monitor</strong></p>

<p>If you're serious about getting the right colors you first need to make sure what you see on screen is really what's in the file, this will probably get you predictable results (that is, the difference between screen and printer will be predictable and you can learn to compensate).</p>

<p>There are several systems that will let you calibrate monitors, some are not very expensive.</p>

<p>This should be enough for most serious hobbyists and pros</p>

<p><strong>3. Use name brand paper that has profiles available</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to use good paper and get printer profiles for that paper you are using.</p>

<p><strong>4. Calibrate your printer</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to get a device that can calibrate both your screen and your specific printer with the specific printer you are using.</p>

<p>Those are definitely not cheap and this should be good enough for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>5. Know when to stop</strong></p>

<p>This rabbit hole goes very deep, if you want truly accurate color you might find yourself in a black shirt (to avoid reflection) in a room with gray walls and special balanced lights (to avoid color casts) manually adjusting color space conversions.</p>

What is the Golden Ratio, how can I apply it to my photography, and why is it better than the Rule of Thirds?</p>
","<p>There are several good and very thorough technical answers, so I'll try to provide some practical usage of these two guidelines. Neither rule is ""better"" or ""worse"" than the other...both are simply general guidelines of composition. A simpler way to compare the two is as so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Rule of Thirds is a grid division into even thirds (33/33/33).<br>
  The Golden Ratio is approximately a 62/38 division.<br>
  The Golden Ratio leads to the intersection of important diagonals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When composing a scene, there is nothing that says you can't apply both rules. Dividing a scene into 9 cells on a 3x3 grid is easy and quick, and many camera viewfinders/LCD's already present us with such a grid that we can work with.</p>

<p>The Golden Ratio is a little harder to use, however when you use it to align your primary subjects (such as a facial portrait), it can lead to the most pleasing compositions. To borrow from @cabby's fibonacci spiral image, you can also view it as so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7CwT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note the point of convergence of the red and green lines. That particular point is the key point when using the Golden Ratio in photography. The simple rule here is to start from one side of the image, and visualize a square starting from that edge. Bisect that square along a diagonal. Bisect the entire image from the opposing corners, and place the key element of your key subject at the intersection of those bisecting lines. In the case of a portrait (where this rule is commonly used), you would want to place the eyes right around the point of intersection. You can also use this rule to photograph still subjects. It should be noted that the Golden Ratio is infinitely divisible (as you can see in the spiral image above), so you could identify multiple points of intersection for sub areas of a photograph, and place key still subjects at those points. You also have the option of following the spiral, and placing key subjects at the intersection of any two lines and part of the spiral curve.</p>

"Is it better to shoot with a higher ISO, or use lower ISO and raise the exposure in post-processing?","62051","","<p>Suppose there are two photos taken in the following scenario:</p>

<p>Scenario 1 - Photo taken using ISO of 3200.</p>

<p>Scenario 2 - Photo taken using ISO of 100.</p>

<p>Both photos are taken in a medium light scenario. The photo in Scenario 2 is quite dark, while the photo taken in Scenario 1 looks good.</p>

<p>From my understanding, higher ISO gives a more grainy photo. So could a photo in scenario 2 (which appears quite dark) be modified in software (e.g. Photoshop) to increase the brightness, and be better than the photo taken with a higher ISO?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>From my understanding, higher ISO gives a more grainy photo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm afraid your understanding is incorrect. High ISO doesn't necessarily give a more grainy photo as there are other factors involved. In some circumstances it can be the case that lowering ISO increases noise. I did an experiment a while back to prove this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/ISOcomparison/ISO_100_vs_ISO_1600.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/ISOcomparison/ISO_100_vs_ISO_1600.jpg</a></p>

<p>What you're seeing is exactly what you describe, one image shot at ISO 1600 unedited, versus the same photo shot at ISO 100, brightened in post to match the first image.</p>

<p>As you can see the ISO 100 image is considerably noisier.</p>

<p>What's going on is that images contain <em>shot noise</em> and <em>read noise</em>. Shot noise occurs because photons are emitted randomly by lightsources which gives rise to variations in the light hitting each part of the sensor. Read noise occurs as the analogue signal is transferred from the sensor to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"" rel=""noreferrer"">ADC</a>.</p>

<p>What the ISO setting on the camera does is amplify the analogue signal before readout and digitization. When amplifying the signal the shot noise gets amplified too, thus the signal to noise ratio is the same. However the read noise does not get amplified as it happens after amplification. When you shoot at low ISO and brighten the image in software, the photon noise, and the read noise both get amplified, giving a higher level of noise.</p>

<hr>

<p>So why is ISO deemed to determine image noise?</p>

<p>It is true that <strong>the lowest possible level of noise is achieved at the lowest possible ISO with as much light as possible hitting the sensor</strong>.</p>

<p>It is also true that the greatest speed for my car is achieved in fifth gear. But this doesn't mean putting it into fifth with the engine idling will increase my speed. The biggest influence on speed in the throttle position. Gearing just prevents stalling or overrevving the engine.</p>

<p>In the same way the biggest influence on noise is the total amount of light falling on the sensor. But you have to set the ISO to avoid over or under exposing the image.</p>

<p>ISO does not have a direct relationship with noise, if you have a very dim scene with little light falling on the sensor then you will have noise regardless of the ISO setting. Likewise if you have tons of light falling on the sensor you will have very little noise regardless of the ISO setting (though you might have overexposure!)</p>

<p>Another problem with perceptions of noise and ISO is that in any of the automatic shooting modes P/Tv/Av increasing the ISO will cause the camera to alter the shutter speed and/or aperture which results in less light hitting the sensor which means more noise. However in manual mode for a fixed shutter speed and aperture, increasing the ISO <em>will not result in more noise being present in the image</em>.</p>

<p>So why does any of this matter? After all if you want the lowest noise your camera can offer you just set it on a tripod, pick ISO 100 and leave the shutter open as long as possible before the image becomes overexposed.</p>

<p>The problem is that thinking about ISO first can lead to misunderstandings. For example when using the above approach in dim light with the aperture wide open, the shutter might max out at 1/30s. People remember the <em>ISO 100 = lowest noise</em> part, forget about the need to get a correct exposure (or are mislead by the image on the back of the LCD, which can look well exposed when you're viewing the screen in the dark) and end up underxposing the image, giving more noise than if they'd shot at say ISO 400.</p>

<p>It is just as correct to say <strong>the lowest possible level of noise is achieved when as much light as possible is hitting the sensor (without overexposing the image) and the ISO is as high as possible (without overexposing the image)</strong>. In most cases the highest ISO possible will be 100.</p>

<p>Thinking about the level of light first, then the ISO avoids pitfalls when there is some limit to how much light you can get onto the sensor during the exposure.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are other minsunderstandings that originate from thinking about ISO as the primary factor that determines noise. One such misunderstanding relates to a camera's base (minimum native) ISO. Someone with a camera Y whose base ISO is 200 might think ""since ISO 200 gets me the cleanest images, wouldn't it be great to have ISO 50 like camera X"". Now it may be the case that camera Y has a sensor with fantastic quantum efficiency, and very good microlenses meaning it is very efficient at capturing light, hence images become overexposed quickly, leading to a high base ISO. Camera X might have a much older sensor with poor QE, no microlenses and low fill factor. It wastes a lot of light and thus requires longer exposures. It also produces images with the same level of noise at ISO 50 as Y does at ISO 200. Just because the number is lower doesn't mean it's better.</p>

<p>Finally thinking about light first helps explain ""ISO less"" sensors, such as the latest batch of Sony sensors found in cameras like the Pentax K5 or Nikon D800. The read noise is so low that it doesn't make any difference if you amplify the signal prior to readout, meaning that you can get comparable results at many different ISO settings, proving that ISO isn't responsible for image noise.</p>

<hr>

<p>My preferred method of shooting is in manual mode with auto-ISO. This allows me to select the depth of field and amount of motion blur that I want/can tolerate in the image, and then have the camera minimise noise for me. </p>

"50mm vs 85mm for portraits on a crop sensor?","61804","","<p>I've read several times that a 50mm lens will make features like noses noticeably stand out compared to an 85mm lens.  However, I'm never sure if the post/article is describing results on a full frame or crop sensor.  I know that the longer the focal length, the more the compression to features....because the crop sensor gives a 50mm the effect of a longer focal length, how noticeable is the facial distortion on say, a Canon 550D?  I'm considering a prime for portrait work and I'm 'at the crossroads' like all of you who came before me.</p>

<p>I will generally be using the lens for wedding portraits on the beach (and they generally want to get married around sunset, so formal portraits come as I'm losing light — hence wanting a tack sharp f1.8 or below), so it would be handy to have a lens that can take more than just a head/shoulder shot.</p>
","<p>I think Eric's answer is what I have been trying to justify to myself.  I'm going to try to explain it, and I hope I get it right (I know people will correct me if I'm wrong!).</p>

<p>That is, it is the distance that determines the compression/disortion, not the focal length. However to get the same <em>framing</em> on a crop-sensor vs. a full-frame sensor, you'd need to change the distance if using the <em>same</em> lens on each camera. </p>

<p>In other words, a 57mm focal length on a 1.5x crop sensor, should provide the same perspective <em>and</em> framing as an 85mm focal length on a full-frame sensor if shot from the same distance.</p>

<p>Now, it seems that 85mm-105mm is most recommended for portraits (full-frame), so a 50mm on a crop-sensor might be too wide (you'd have to get in tighter and introduce more distortion).  I think this is why you'll see people using a 70mm (like a 70-200mm) for portaits on a crop-sensor (yielding an effective 105mm on full-frame).</p>

","<p>There are two possible interpretations of this question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can you trigger an exposure with the lens removed:  </p>

<p>Answer: It's camera specific. Try setting the camera to manual mode. On my Nikon D80, it will not take an exposure with the lens removed except when in full manual (""M"" on the mode dial).</p></li>
<li><p>Can you take a meaningful or interesting image without <em>something</em> acting like a lens.  </p>

<p>This is where things get tricky. For instance, I would argue that anything that projects some sort of pattern of light onto a surface (in this case, the sensor), effectively <strong>is</strong> a lens. Therefore, unless you want a flat, monochromatic exposure, you <em>have</em> to have some sort of lens.<br>
A pin-hole lens (as described by Hasin Hayder in <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/20969"">his answer</a>), is still arguably a lens, even if it is not a <em>refracting</em> lens.

The problem which I am facing is that, the picture looks different on the laptop when screen on the laptop is moved a little back and forth.</p>

<p>How do I adjust colors in that case, and how can I be sure that the image looks the same on all desktops and laptops — if not 100%, at least to some extent, like 80-90%?</p>

<p>Bottom line involves calibrating I suppose, but while editing in laptop screens, how do I make sure that what I am looking at, is a correct representation of the image?</p>

<p>Any techniques to use without investing in any external hardware would be particularly useful.</p>
","<p><strong>It is pretty much impossible</strong>, although you can get closer.</p>

<p>At the very least you need a color-calibration device. Using that device you calibrate your screen so that the <strong>colors it can show</strong> are close to how they should be. Most laptop displays sadly only show 60-75% of sRGB color, so there can be up to 40% of colors you cannot see in the laptop. Instead they get substituted for another color. It can make it very surprising when you see your image elsewhere.</p>

<p>Even if you get a top-quality laptop like a Thinkpad W700 which has a color-calibration device built-in, you still only get 84% sRGB coverage which is on par with crappy monitors and yet costs a fortune.</p>

<p><strong>Ideally, you would get a color-calibratable display and hook it to your laptop</strong> while you do any work which has to do with colors. The are relatively cheap these days and I know you can get the <a href=""http://www.necdisplay.com/p/desktop-monitors/p221w-bk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NEC P221W</a> for under $450, so they are definitely affordable now. If that is too expensive, look for it refurbished (I bought 2 of those for $237 each like that). This is the cheapest wide-gamut display I know and covers 100% of sRGB and 96% of AdobeRGB color spaces, it also supports 10-bit internal LUTs which reduces calibration artifacts.</p>

"What is the right way to format a SD Card for use in camera?","56166","","<p>What is the right way to format a SD card to be used for pictures? Inside the camera or SD card software?</p>

<p>According to SD card spec, there is a protected area on the card that can be over-written when formatted with an operating system formatting tool. The use of OS formatting tool can also make the card slower and shorten the lifespan.</p>

<p>For these reason I use SD card formatter software <a href=""https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/"" rel=""noreferrer"">downloaded from SD card Association</a>.</p>

<p>I have Nikon D3000 that has an option to format the SD card inside. Does the camera format the SD card preserving the protective area?</p>
","<p>The short answer is that it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>The ""protected area"" is not important for photography; I'm not aware of any camera that uses it. This area is theoretically used for user-hostile copy protection and is not really for your benefit in any case. When using your camera to store photos, you can just ignore it.</p>

<p>The concern about less than optimal performance is unlikely to be relevant with any modern operating system (or camera). I think the main concern is that the OS may do a ""full format"", causing unnecessary writes. Since this is terribly slow on any storage device of the capacities we use these days, every OS uses the better-for-flash quick formatting anyway. There's more on this under <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/1988/1943"">How often should memory cards be formatted?</a></p>

<p>As answers to that question note, camera makers usually recommend formatting in-camera rather than with a computer. There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>A user could format the card with an incompatible filesystem, like NTFS or HFS. This would cause confused users and expensive tech-support calls. Better to just say ""do it in the camera"".</li>
<li>Very unlikely, but a bug in some OS's FAT implementation or in the camera's own firmware could conflict. Keeping it all in-camera is safer here (but I've never heard of this really happening — the filesystem format is simple and well understood).</li>
<li>Formatting in-camera causes the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/2733/1943"">DCIM folder structure</a> to be created — but as this happens when you write a photo if it's not there already, this is unimportant.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you understand all this, there's absolutely no harm in formatting the card on your computer, with the special SD Card Association firmware or with the OS's own tools. If you don't, use the camera's own formatting to be safe.</p>

<p>For example, the Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 ...or the like, that cost so much money.</p>

<p><em>Why do they need such big zoom lenses?</em>  Isn't a 50mm or a 85mm more than enough with apertures surrounding 1.8-2.8?</p>

<p>Or is it to just look ""pro""?</p>

<p>A picture explanation, if necessary, is preferred.</p>
","<p>Long lenses are typically used for portraits as the greater working distance they allow flatters the subject. This is due to the effect of foreshortening, the perspective is compressed when shooting further from the subject using a long focal length, making features like noses stick out less.</p>

<p>You can shoot portraits with a wide lens, but you're going to get funky looking shots that aren't always what you want:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/matt_grum/3081637169/in/photostream"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3094/3081637169_d37d32abc3_o.jpg""></a></p>

<p>You lose the sticky out nose effect by about 80mm or so (when framing tight). So why go longer? There's another plus when shooting with long lenses and that is subject separation. Longer lenses make it easier to get a nice blurry background.</p>

<p>My favourite portrait lens is the Canon 135mm f/2.0L, it's relatively small and light, and wide open it gives very nice backgrounds (better than the 85mm f/1.2 in my opinion):</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/blurred_background.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/blurred_background.jpg</a></p>

<p>Regarding aperture, blurring backgrounds is not just about having a really fast aperture like f/1.8 or f/1.4, in fact with some lenses like the Canon 24mm f/1.4L make it pretty hard to get a blurred background even wide open, without focusing very close. In the following shot I completely obliterated the background - at f/5.6!</p>

<p>How? By using an 800mm lens!</p>

<p>Finally, it's definitely not about looking pro - unless there were some advantage to a big lens pro's wouldn't use them and therefore it wouldn't look pro! Something like the 70-200 is a very versatile lens, long enough for flattering perspective, wide enough to use indoors and fast for low light. You don't need all those things at once for portraiture, but why buy an extra lens when the one you have will do great?</p>

<p>I don't worry too much about a large lens intimidating people - it's how you act as a photographer that will make them feel most at ease, not the size of the lens.</p>

It asked what white point I wanted, and had a default of 6500K.  I didn't realize that was up for discussion!  I would have assumed the daylight temperature, around 5500K, would be desired.</p>

<p>What temperature do I want my whites to be? Why can't white just be white?!</p>
","<p>This can be a complex answer, and quite often, the outcome is that it depends what you print on, meaning you might need to change it or recalibrate often. </p>

<p><strong>On White Point</strong></p>

<p>White point from the perspective of the human eye is a very subjective thing, as the eye automatically ""recalibrates"" itself to differing white points depending on the kind of light that dominates a scene. To start the discussion, lets start in the middle: Sunlight has a white-point of about 5500k (although it tends to range in reality from between 5000k and 6000k). As you noted, most screens these days are calibrated by default to a white point of 6500k, which appears to be more white than lower values. Some screens often come with a built-in range of settings, such as 5000k, 5500k, 6500k, and some even as high as 7500k and 9300k or around there (which have a bluish tinge to them.)</p>

<p><strong>Why Set a White Point?</strong></p>

<p>The key reason why we set a white point is not so that it appears ""white"" to our eyes. The main reason we set a white point is to match the ""white"" on screen to the ""white"" of the material and environment in which your photos will be viewed. There is no single correct, standard viewing environment, and depending on how you normally publish your images, the white-point you select may be different than other photographers. A couple of the most common viewing mediums are on a computer screen (i.e. you publish your work to Flickr, 1x.com, etc.) and print. </p>

<p><strong>White Point for Screen Display</strong></p>

<p>If you really don't care much about print, and only really exhibit your work online, you might want to stick with a white point of 6500k. That is a very common white point, and the default for many computer screens, particularly lower-end ones. The color profile sRGB, a standard and very widely used color gamut, is also aligned to a 6500k white point. Most images saved for viewing on a computer screen should be saved using the sRGB color profile when possible (using a wider gamut, such as Adobe RGB, may be necessary if your image has very vibrant colors, particularly greens, but also reds and violets, as sRGB is a more limited white point. Adobe RGB also uses a 6500k white point.) Using 6500k will mean that what you see with your calibrated display will generally be very similar to what your viewers see when they browse your work online. There is no guarantee of this, of course, as screen vary in minute to major ways for a very wide variety of reasons, but it is a reasonable baseline. </p>

<p><strong>White Point for Prints</strong></p>

<p>Things get more complicated when you involve print. Papers tend to have warmer white points much of the time, so the common default of 6500k makes white on a computer screen look quite a bit whiter than it does on print. Papers also come in an extremely wide variety, from very very warm (4800k or sometimes even warmer), to very bright, almost blue white (7500k or cooler.) This is where screen calibration is really important, as having your screen matched as closely to the papers you print on will make it easier to generate properly calibrated and color balanced prints. </p>

<p>When it comes to paper, the story is extremely complex. Paper is a very old enterprise that extends back over 600 years. There are some general buckets that you can put papers into, however: fine art paper, canvas, and coated/brightened. For me, and for many photographers, there is nothing quite like a good fine art paper. These papers come in a huge variety, from many material sources, including the common wood, but also uncommon sources like cotton, bamboo, and sometimes even mixed blends that may include animal fibers. The tones and textures of fine art papers are amazing, and can have a huge impact on the appearance and appeal of a final print. Fine art papers tend to be warmer, and its best to calibrate your display to a white point of 5000k. Canvas is another type of printable paper these days. There are also a variety of canvas papers, however much less variety than fine art papers. Canvas is also a warmer type of media, and can range from 5000k to 5500k. The third major bucket of paper includes coated papers. Many fine art papers are uncoated, non-brightened, letting the natural fibers produce the tone and texture of the paper. Coated papers cover the natural fiber base with one or more coatings to provide a smoother surface, surfaces that are more receptive and ideal for ink jet printing (or other types of printing), and protected from the elements allowing a longer-lasting print. Coated papers often also include optical brighteners to make the white point of the paper brighter and ""whiter"". Such papers often have much higher white points than natural papers, up to as high as 7500k or so. A white point of 7500k is extremely bright, bordering on blueish. Papers with optical brighteners are sometimes difficult to calibrate for, as the brighteners often depend on the type of light they are viewed with. Many brighteners use UV reactive components, and produce their brilliant white by reflecting UV rays from natural sunlight (or artificial gas lighting like flourescent tubes.) As such, their white point can change depending on the lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a White Point</strong></p>

<p>So, what should your white point be when you calibrate your display? It depends, and it may change frequently if you publish to a variety of media types. I myself use the DataColor Spyder3 system to calibrate all of my hardware. I normally calibrate to a white point of 5000k, for a few reasons. First, most of my work I print on my Canon 9500 II, on fine art papers. I am a big fan of Hahnemuhle, Moab, and a few others. All of the papers I use, such as Photo Rag and Canvas, have warmer 5000k white points. I also publish a lot of my work online, and every so often I recalibrate to 6500k to preview my images online and see how they look. (With the Spyder3 Pro, it is very easy and very quick to change white point and do a short recalibration that takes about 5 minutes.)</p>

<p>Another reason to use 5000k as your base white point is if you use Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop has its own color management system, and internally by default it is calibrated to a white point of 5000k (often abbreviated D50, along with D55/5500k, D65/6500k, etc.) By calibrating your display to 5000k, you sync your hardware to Adobe Photoshop's default settings, which makes it a little easier to convert and/or apply color profiles and see accurate results.</p>

<p>Finally, the light you view your prints under has a direct effect on what ""white"" looks like. If viewing prints in sunlight, they will generally be lit by ""normal"" white light, at a temperature of around 5500k. Artificial lighting can vary. Common light bulbs range in temperature from about 2500k to 4200k, which is quite warm. Flourescent lighting, which is less common in homes, is hard to nail down. Often cooler, 6500k to 7200k or so, they also output greener or violet lighting. Sometimes they come in warmer variants that are more similar to standard bulbs. Calibrating to a warmer white point helps balance out differences between what you see on screen, and what you see in print.</p>

<p><strong>More to the Story</strong></p>

<p>The calibration story does not stop at white point. If you really want to have accurate color calibration throughout your entire workflow, there are additional factors, such as luminance (how bright your screen is), gamma, environment lighting, etc. If you have additional questions about calibration, feel free to ask other questions, and I'll see if I can provide a useful answer.</p>

"How can I fire a single canon 430ex flash remotely from a Canon 6D camera?","55319","","<p>I don't ever use flash but I would like to start learning about portraits and lighting. I have a mainly unused Canon 430ex which I would like to use off camera with a softbox or bouncing of an umbrella. I am pretty sure I cannot fire it remotely from either my Canon 6D or 60D without additional hardware. I am a total ""flash newbie"" so I don't know mych about flash transmitters, etc. <strong>What sort of equipment/trigger/transmitter do I need to fire my flash remotely.</strong>  I figure some sort of a radio control? Recommendations welcomed. </p>
","<p>I use this: <a href=""http://amzn.com/B002W3IXZW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://amzn.com/B002W3IXZW</a> from cowboy studio or if you have more money I would get this: <a href=""http://amzn.com/B00BBQ8IDS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://amzn.com/B00BBQ8IDS</a> from Pocketwizard which was just released. Many people also praise the inexpensive Yongnuo transmitter/triggers.</p>

<p>The 60D even has a built in wireless transmitter. The 60D's built-in flash can act as a controller or commander to multiple, remote wireless flashes. It is a pretty great feature first introduced in the 7D. As far as I can tell, the 430EX will work in slave mode with the 60D in this way. I haven't looked too far into it though to confirm. </p>

<p>You can optically trigger with the 60D since it has a built in flash, without any additional equipment. It just isn't all that reliable and requires line of sight.</p>

<p>The 6D does not have a built in transmitter unfortunately, or a flash, so you need to either buy a 580ex/600ex style flash or a flash trigger like I linked to above.</p>

<p>In essence, if you are looking to use one system with both flashes, you will need to invest in some new equipment.</p>

","<p>In my experience, if there's lots of cloud overhead, but a break in the cloud towards the western horizon, then as the sun dips below it will illuminate pretty much the whole sky. Don't forget that the best lighting occurs AFTER the sun has actually set. Make sure you have some foreground interest too, if possible, just to add a bit of depth.</p>

"Should I use a GoPro as a small camera for taking pictures in and outside?","54853","","<p>I just want to buy a small camera for taking some indoor and outdoor pictures.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GETND.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The size settings actually set two different things for any JPEG images taken by the camera: the resolution of the image being taken (the # x # size), and the quality setting for the JPEG compression for the image.  </p>

<p>The L, M, and S sizes vary individually by the camera, but the numbers at the top in the blue bar tell you the pixel dimensions.  So, in this case, your L size images are 5760x3840 (or 22MP).  The larger the size you choose, the bigger the file will be, but the higher the resolution and the larger you can print out the image.</p>

<p>The ""smoothness"" of the quarter-circle indicates the quality level you're selecting.  The higher the quality setting, the larger the file will be, but the more data is retained.  JPEG is a ""lossy"" compression scheme that discards some of the color information in favor of making a smaller file. So, the smooth quarter-circle indicates ""high"" quality (large file, but less data discarded), and the stair-step quarter-circle indicates ""medium"" quality (smaller file, but more data discarded).  </p>

"What settings should I use when growing out of auto modes for indoor photography?","53665","","<p>I am very new to DSLRs. I have an entry-level Canon with the 18-55mm kit lens, and I can use auto modes. Now, I have some indoor photography I need to do for work, and thought to use this opportunity as a learning purpose as well.</p>

<p>So, I would like to know what should be the settings I have to apply if I do this on manual mode. The environment is inside a room, white background, and the  light condition is not very good (just ceiling lights). How should I approach this?</p>
","<p>Please don't be afraid of higher ISO settings. While it's true that ISO 6400 is a bit much for the 600D (and ISO 12800 is for emergencies only, like surveillance or ""get the shot or else"" photojournalism), ISO 1600 is perfectly OK on the 600D and ISO 3200 will clean up acceptably.</p>

<p>Remember: look at the picture, not at the pixels. It will make you a much happier photographer, and probably a much better one. With a lens having image stabilization and IS turned on, you ought to be able to hand-hold your camera (with practice) in most indoor conditions at ISO 1600 or 3200, and most human subjects (well, most grown-up human subjects, at least) should be able to keep still for the expected 1/8 to 1/30 shutter speed with a kit lens set to its maximum (lowest f-number) aperture if they try. Trying to use a lower ISO will mean that you need to use a tripod, and that you'd have to ""freeze"" your subjects long enough that even their small, involuntary movements are going to show up as image blur. A quarter of a second doesn't sound like much time, but it's hard to keep a person really still that long.</p>

<p>Set your camera on aperture priority, and use the widest aperture you can. Don't switch to a lower ISO unless the camera tells you that the shutter speed it's going to use is faster than 1/60s. Grain (noise) is a pain, but a faster shutter speed and the resulting sharper picture will result in a much better picture than something that is virtually noise-free but blurry. If you're hand-holding, don't close down your aperture unless you can do that while maintaining a high enough shutter speed (and, depending on the shot, you may want to close down the aperture before you even think about lowering the ISO so that you can get more of the scene in focus).</p>

<p>If you can bring more light, do it. Even a cheap LED ""camping lantern"", strategically placed, can make a huge difference (without affecting anyone's power usage). The light it produces will probably be very blue compared to the existing light, but you can either filter it (if proper photographic filters aren't available easily, you can use amber-coloured cellophane gift wrapping) or use the blue to artisic advantage. A plug-in work or utility lamp may be useful too if the electricity it uses isn't going to cause anyone financial hardship. A DSLR is a sensitive instrument, so you don't need anything like the truckload of location lighting we used to need in the film days; a 23-watt compact fluorescent bulb added to the light that's already there can make a huge difference to the picture.</p>

"What's the advantage of buying a fixed 50mm f/1.8 lens when my camera has an 18-55mm zoom lens?","53532","","<p>I've got a Nikon D3100 with an 18-55mm zoom lens. I'm keen to experiment with some other lenses and a friend of mine recently reccommended I purchase a fixed 50mm f/1.8 lens as he said it's good for portrait photography and capturing really sharp images. He also said that as it isn't a zoom lens it will sharpen my composition skills.</p>

<p>My question is - I currently have an 18-55mm zoom lens, so by purchasing a 50mm fixed lens, won't I be purchasing a spec of lens already covered by my 18-55mm lens? What are the main differences between these two lenses?</p>

<p>Finally - can anybody vouch for the Nikon fixed 50mm f/1.8 lens as being a good lens to go for?</p>
","<p>At 50mm on your 18-55, the max aperture  is f/5.6. On the 50mm f/1.8, the max aperture is - obviously - f/1.8. It is perhaps not immediately obvious, but f/1.8 lets in 10-12 times more light than f/5.6. That is the difference between shooting at 1/10 second shutter speed (which is absolutely a no-go for moving subjects) and shooting at 1/100 (which is a usable shutter speed for moving subjects). Big difference indoors at night, for example. It lets you shoot without flash, or with the flash used as mere fill flash instead of it being the main light-source.</p>

<p>Note that Nikon has two variants of the 50/1.8, one with a built-in autofocus motor and an older one without. Do get the new one.</p>

"What mm lens for distance shots?","52834","","<p>If I am looking to take landscape and wildlife shots and some of those shots being from a decent distance what mm lens would I need? I am not sure what else I should be adding here, I am just looking for decent quality above all else.</p>
","<p>The <code>mm</code> of a lens is the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/103/"">focal length</a>. To take close-up shots of things far away, you need a ""long"" focal length, which means high mm.</p>

<p>An entry or mid-level Canon camera has an ""APS-C"" sized sensor. The sensor size is really what determines what the <em>meaning</em> of the focal length is — focal length and sensor size together give you <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/5917/what-is-angle-of-view-in-photography"">angle of view</a>. (See my <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/5924/1943"">visual exercise for understanding that</a>.)</p>

<p>To get another <strong>visual</strong> idea of what all this means, look at the answers to 
<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/9133/how-can-i-visualize-or-simulate-the-effect-of-different-focal-lengths"">How can I visualize or simulate the effect of different focal lengths?</a>, particularly the one that points to <a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/simulator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikon's web-based lens simulator</a>. As mentioned, the numbers are <em>slightly</em> different from Nikon to Canon (choose Nikon's ""DX"" format to be closest to an entry-level Canon), but close enough that it really doesn't matter for basic purposes. Drag the slider at the bottom to see the effect of a focal length ranging from 10mm to an extreme 600mm.</p>

<p>After playing with that, come back here to read some explanation of what all this means:</p>

<p>Canon's APS-C is slightly smaller than that from Nikon, Sony, or Pentax. This isn't a big deal, but for those systems the numbers below should be a few percent larger for the same meaning. All of the definitions are <em>rough categories</em>, though, so it's close enough that it really doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Anyway, on Canon's APS-C, a focal length of about 27mm is considered <em>normal</em> — that means when printed at normal size, you get a perspective that seems natural and about what you might expect your memory of the scene to be.</p>

<p>Focal lengths in somewhere in that neighborhood are also considered normal: probably up to 40mm or so, and down to about 22mm.</p>

<p>Once you get smaller than 22mm, you're into <em>wide angle</em>. Wide angle won't be terribly flattering for portraits (it will cause features to be exaggerated if your subject is close enough to fill the frame), but the more-normal end of the wide range is pretty common for street photography. And, <strong>wide angle is very common for the landscape shots you mention.</strong></p>

<p>Down below 15mm, it's ""ultra-wide"", where perspective distortion starts to be a key feature of the way the lens sees. This can be used for landscapes, but you have to be very aware of the distortion and the field of view of the lens — see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/12691/what-makes-a-strong-wide-angle-composition"">this question on ultra-wide composition</a>.</p>

<p>On the other side, there's the <em>telephoto</em> range. Telephoto has a technical meaning, but generally we use it to just mean a lens with a relatively long focal length (high mm). The range from around 50mm to 85mm is considered <em>short telephoto</em> or <em>portrait</em> — the latter because, well, it's a good range for flattering perspective for portraits, and it's not so narrow that you have to stand hundreds of feet from your subject.</p>

<p>Beyond that is the real <em>telephoto</em> range. <strong>This is generally what people want for action and wildlife shots</strong>, because they enable you to get right into the action without <em>actually</em> being close. </p>

<p>Consumer-priced telephoto zooms usually go to 200mm, 250mm, or 300mm.
Lower-cost lenses in this range tend to have less ability to let in light — they are ""<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/13619/what-is-a-fast-lens"">slow lenses</a>"". The fancier, ""faster"" lenses in this range used by professionals and enthusiasts for sports and wildlife cost one to two thousand dollars. And for fast lenses beyond 300mm, you could pay several times that, even.</p>

<p>But that's probably not what you're looking for right now. It <em>might</em> be — one advantage of just getting the nicer equipment to start is that you can forget about buying stuff for a while and just go out and enjoy while you grown into your gear, rather than growing out of it soon and wasting money trading up. So if you <em>know</em> a 70-200mm f/2.8 pro lens is right for you, it's not a mistake to just start there.</p>

<p>However, it's likely that you'll feel most comfortable starting out with a <em>standard two-lens zoom kit</em>. This isn't a <em>bundle</em> as sold by those shady camera stores: it's something from the camera makers. Almost all entry-level SLRs come with a 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom (note that the numbers go from wide angle at 18mm up through normal to portrait length at 55mm — this is a very versatile range, which is why it's the default). Many are also offered in two-lens kits with a 50-200mm telephoto zoom — or else, a 50-200mm lens is available separately cheaply. Sometimes, there's ""upgrade"" options like a 55-300mm zoom, also usually of lower-end features and quality for a similarly-reasonable price. You won't go wrong buying a setup like this from any of the top handful of brands.</p>

"What's the best way to take a picture of an LCD or CRT screen?","52281","","<p>I have seen many bad pictures of LCD and CRT screens. How do I get a good picture of an LCD or CRT screen?</p>
","<p>It's not very hard to take a good photo of an LCD or CRT screen. I'll add oscilloscope in here as a special case of both as I've taken many such over the years. </p>

<p>A few pointers. Some of the following may sound complex and daunting at first glance,<br>
<strong>but</strong> it's all fairly intuitive taken a section at a time. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shutter speed is critical for a frame-refreshed device due to the way the image is written to screen. Understand the nature of the image &ndash; it's a line-scanned image refreshed in interleaved half-images with non-HD 525/625-line TVs, and may be something quite different if using a monitor or oscilloscope or e.g. plasma screen. Play with exposure times to see what works. </p></li>
<li><p>Whole screen refresh rate on a non-HD TV is 30 Hz with 60 Hz mains and 25 Hz with 50 Hz mains. It actually writes a screen at double that speed but with only half the data and then writes the second half interleaved with the first. Whether you can see that half is missing if you shoot at 60/50 Hz depends on the image and phosphor persistence and brightness and image content.</p></li>
<li><p>CRT frame rate will vary with screen mode - you can look it up or check the computer video settings - or just try different shutter speeds until you get one or several that are best. Be aware that frame rate may change if you change the mode. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Using exposure times that are not equal to these can give partial pictures with bright or dark areas or no picture at all if you are especially clever. </p>

<p>Take a series of images at rates from say 0.1 s to 0.01s and probably faster and see what ""artefacts"" appear. There will (probably) be a shutter speed that best suits and after that you use aperture and ISO and leave shutter speed alone. </p>

<p>I just tried various speeds on a 1080p plasma screen and anything <em>below</em> (slower than) 1/90th second is good. Above 1/90th the image artefacts are bizarre and almost inexplicable. </p>

<p>A CRT  oscilloscope usually scans left to right <em>but</em> a modern LCD screen oscilloscope may combine trace write time with frame writes, so start playing.</p>

<p>Once you are happy with shutter speed effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use minimal background light - have a desk lamp handy that you can turn off when taking photos. Washing out the image is easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Tripod or solid support! Frame the screen and leave it there <em>or</em> if that's not convenient have a setup where you can promptly put it back in the exact position. For some work I've used two drawer slides with a board on top that allows the camera to be ""dollied"" sideways out of the way with minimal loss of position on return, given due care <sup>tm</sup>.</p></li>
<li><p>Small aperture but not so small as to get diffraction.<br>
With a flat screen yje depth of field needed is minimal.<br>
A curved CRT screen  needs only a little. f/8 is probably ok and f/11 or f/16 are usually very usable. Exposure time will go up. </p></li>
<li><p>ISO - something that gives quality with your camera. The higher the better that gives acceptable quality. I have a Sony SLT-A77 that probably would be OK at ISO 800.<br>
A Nikon D700 or any newer FF camera is liable to be OK at ISO 2400.<br>
My older 5D &amp; 7D Minoltas may need ISO 400. A700 Sony: 400 to 800.<br>
ISO 50 or 100 if you must, but quality usually does not justify it.</p></li>
<li><p>Manual focus and exposure are not essential but may help.<br>
If having to move and replace the camera, if available set to ""Manual focus with press to focus when needed"" and do NOT use 'focus with shutter button'. </p></li>
<li><p>Set LCD/CRT/scope scope picture and camera exposure to what produces good results. Phosphor persistence will usually cause blurred lines at settings that look OK to the naked eye.  Probably have scope trace dim and well focused. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Play.</p>

<p>With an oscilloscope, if it has an ""illuminated graticule"" adjust the level to look good &ndash; not blazing bright with regard to trace and not invisible. </p>

<p>LCD screens' best viewing angle will vary with contrast setting. If contrast is not adjustable you <em>may</em> find that an angle above or below horizontal works best.</p>

"How to take pictures in a dark room?","52252","","<p>I'm a total newbie to photography. I have a Nikon D90 and at the moment I'm trying to learn how to actually use it.</p>

<p>I've noticed that whenever I shoot in a dark room with the on-camera pop up flash, the picture looks somewhat unrealistic; I don't know how to precisely describe it, but this slight motion that makes pictures look alive is not captured (probably due to the high shutter speed). If I turn the flash off, pictures are just dark and obscure.</p>

<p>Is there a way to shoot (not necessarily still) objects, with or without flash is actually not important, but to be able to capture the live image? Also would be nice to be able to see something on those images.</p>
","<p><strong>When you take pictures with the flash, it looks unreal because your room is not normally lit by a flash or by only a light source attached to your forehead.</strong></p>

<p>Now, assuming your room is dark but not pitch black, what you need to do it take a photo without the flash. To get better results you will have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase your ISO as high as it is acceptable to you. You can go to 1600 or 3200 if you do not intend to make a large print with the image.</li>
<li>Open your aperture as wide as possible. You do this in A mode and turn the dial until you get a bright aperture (smaller numbers). You will see the shutter-speed increase at the same time if you are doing it right.</li>
<li>Buy yourself a brighter lens. Something with a wide maximum aperture. A number of not so expensive ones have F/1.8 or F/1.4 (even better). This lets it get 2-4X times more light than the kit lens, depending of the focal-length.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is always a limit. At one point, it becomes too dark for any camera and lens. If you have people in your room, then the shutter-speed should at least be 1/60 if they are still and probably 1/250 if they are moving. Otherwise they will appear blurry.</p>

"How do I generate high quality prints with an ink jet printer?","52195","","<p>Creating high-quality photo prints using an ink jet printer is no trivial matter. Depending on the tonal range and color depth desired and the expected viewing platform, how you approach printing may differ.

","<h1>Generating High Quality Ink Jet Prints: Summary</h1>

<p>Making effective use of professional photographic ink jet printers is tricky business, especially when the statistics that are commonly used to describe these printers are vague and misleading. Learning how a ink jet printers function, how to properly interpret their capabilities, and make the most effective use of those capabilities, is possible. For those of you not quite as interested in the technical details, who are just looking for a simple answer, here you go.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>The basic terms involved in ink jet printing are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pixel:</strong> Smallest unit of an image.</li>
<li><strong>Dot:</strong> Smallest element of a print generated by a printer.</li>
<li><strong>DPI:</strong> Dots per Inch</li>
<li><strong>PPI:</strong> Pixels per Inch</li>
</ul>

<p>The terms DPI and PPI, while often used interchangeably, are not interchangeable in the context of ink jet printing. A dot is the smallest element that an ink jet printer uses to create an image, and multiple dots are required to create a single pixel of an image. As such, the DPI will generally be higher than the actual resolution the printer prints images at. Most professional ink jet printers use a resolution of 720ppi (Epson) or 600ppi (Canon).</p>

<h2>The Human Eye</h2>

<p>The human eye is a truly amazing device, capable of seeing an astonishing range of color and tone. It does have its limitations, however, unlike a digital camera, which may have many times the resolving power of a human eye. The eye, assuming 20/20 vision (corrected or otherwise) is capable of resolving, or ""seeing distinctly"", details down to at most 500ppi when viewed within a couple inches. Photographs are rarely viewed at such close distances, and are more naturally viewed at around 10""-18"" (25-46cm) for small hand-held prints up to several feet for larger prints hung on a wall. At these sizes and viewing distances, the human eye is capable of resolving details from between 350ppi at 10"" down to 150ppi at several feet.</p>

<h2>Print Resolution</h2>

<p>Due to the limited maximum resolving power of the human eye, extremely high printing resolutions are unnecessary in most viewing conditions. Common handheld prints of 4x6 which are usually viewed at 10"" are best printed at a resolution of 300-360ppi. Larger prints such as an 8x10, likely viewed either laid on a table or framed and displayed, are often viewed at a range of one to two feet. A resolution of 200ppi is about as much as the eye can resolve at these distances. Even larger prints, unless they are intended to be viewed at close distances, are usually framed and hung to be viewed at distances of several feet. Such large prints may be printed at the minimum resolutions of 150-180ppi, without any loss in detail that the eye can see.</p>

<h1>Tonal Range</h1>

<p>Despite the frequency at which resolution is touted as the most important factor in a print, there are other factors that matter just as much, if not more. A limited number of dots may be printed per pixel, and the higher the resolution printed at, the fewer dots per pixel. At maximum resolution for Epson or Canon printers, you get around 8 dots per pixel, which gets you a total of 65 distinct tones if we have about 8 ink colors. At half the maximum resolution, you get about 32 dots per pixel, which gets you a total of about 257 distinct tones if we have about 8 ink colors. Using an even lower resolution, say 240-288ppi, you get 128 dots per pixel for a total of 1025 tones.</p>

<p>Ink jet printers these days include a variety of tonal range enhancing features. One of these is the ability to print with varying ink droplet sizes. Epson and Canon offer three different droplet sizes. While the variation in droplet size does not specifically increase your tonal range, it allows the printer to produce smoother tonal gradients, which ultimately has the same effect: better prints.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Printing a quality print is about more than simply printing at the highest resolution. A variety of factors, including viewing distance and required tonal range, should be taken into account. Below is a chart that indicates the available printing resolutions, the corresponding pixel size in dots, the best viewing distance, and the approximage tonal range:</p>

<pre><code>        |  dpi               |  view             | tones/  
   dpp  | 1200 | 1440 | 2400 |  dist             | pixel  
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  
  4x2   |  600 |  720 |  600 |  8"" / 20cm        |  @200  
  6x3   |  400 |  480 |  400 |  9"" / 23cm        |  @450  
  8x4   |  300 |  360 |  300 | 11"" / 28cm        |  @780  
  10x5  |  240 |  288 |  240 | 15"" / 39cm        | @1200  
  12x6  |  200 |  240 |  200 | 18""-24"" / 46-61cm | @1800  
  16x8  |  150 |  180 |  150 | 2'-5' / 61-152cm  | @3000  
</code></pre>

<p>Despite the theoretically higher number of tones per pixel at lower resolutions such as 150-200, the greater viewing distance effectively mitigates the gains. <strong>The optimal printing resolution to get the most out of your printer is likely to fall within the range of 240-360ppi.</strong></p>

"Can a Nikon/Canon flash be used on the other brand of camera?","52141","","<p>I was just thinking about this problem and was wondering if anyone knew if/how to use a competing flash unit (EX or SB series) on a Nikon or Canon (respectively) camera.  I would assume a lot of the brand-specific flash features may not work (wireless for example) but would the manual flash-on-the-hotshoe work fine?</p>

<p>If it is possible, what features are or are not available?</p>

<p>I was thinking about how, for example, in a teaching situation, you could use a single flash on both brands of camera.</p>
","<p>Yes, it will work, or at least, it's worked in the case I've tried (canon flash on a nikon body).  You're right that the specific TTL metering and the like doesn't work, but the flash definitely triggers.</p>

<p>I remember it distinctly, because both of my flashes went down while shooting a large wedding and the primary had a spare canon flash.  She lent it to me, and it worked-- which produced a camera that looked exceedingly strange (what with both canon and nikon working together), but it worked in manual mode.</p>

"Good examples of RAW's advantages over JPEG?","52014","","<p>I'm curious to see some real examples of where simply capturing the same photo in RAW (and being processed by someone who can do it justice) has significantly improved the photo at the end of the process.</p>

<p>I understand what RAW is and why you might want to use it over JPEG, however, I'd like to actually see some examples where it has allowed for a better result. More control over tone, conversion from the more detailed data to 8-bit RGB etc.</p>

<p>Does anyone have or know of some processed RAW+JPEG shots for exact comparison?</p>
","<h2>The Value of RAW:</h2>

<p>I think you may be misunderstanding the value of RAW. In the grand scheme of things, from seeing a scene with your eye to printing it, the best you get is what the printer you printed with is capable of, and that tends to be <strong>considerably less</strong> than what you see, or your camera or your computer is capable of representing. </p>

<p>The value of RAW is not really in the end result, although it is possible for the end result created with a RAW image to be better than that created with a JPEG. The reason for this has to do with the <em>workflow</em> between snapping a shot and saving or printing a final image. RAW gives you headroom that JPEG can't come close to offering. You have the ability to recover highlights and shadows, apply alternative tone curves, rework old RAW images with newer RAW processing algorithms to get better results, etc. </p>

<p>You are basically asking what is the value of an original film negative or slide, over a final scanned JPEG copy of that film negative/slide. With the original film, you have plenty of capability to rework and improve, use different printing techniques, etc...where as with the final JPEG, you got what you got, and not a whole lot more.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p>An original JPEG of Lower Yellowstone Falls. The sky was completely blown out, as this was one of the very first few photos I took over a year ago when I first got into photography. I had researched RAW, along with most other camera theory, long before I ever purchased a camera, so I had RAW+JPEG enabled at the time:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c0xUo.jpg"" alt=""Lower Falls JPEG""></p>

<p>Below is the reworked version from a RAW file. Because of RAW's considerable headroom, I was able to nearly fully recover the horrendously blown out sky, retone the whole image, and generate three alternative exposures (-1.5 EV, Original EV, +1.5 EV) using Lightroom to create a far sharper, clearer, and richer HDR image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZ6ur.jpg"" alt=""Lower Falls RAW Corrected""></p>

<p>It was largely because of the radical improvements I was able to make to this image that I rarely ever shoot in JPEG anymore. I opt for RAW the vast majority of the time, and as I am still a student of the artistic aspects of photography, I appreciate the headroom that RAW offers. Most of the time, the final image saved from a RAW file is very similar to that of a JPEG...its the times when you botched it big and need to massively rework an image that RAW's advantages over JPEG really start to shine. Its all in the workflow, rather than the destination. ;)</p>

<h2>JPEG Example:</h2>

<p>Mark took the time to rework the JPEG sample I posted, to demonstrate what can be done with a JPEG. I think its important to note that a JPEG is not completely unworkable once it is taken...I may have lead to that belief in my comments above. JPEG images do have some room to be reworked, if needed, however it is more limited than RAW. Marks reworked copy of the JPEG sample is here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZvw8.jpg"" alt=""Retouched JPEG Example""></p>

<p>A couple things should be noted. For one, he was able to retone the image decently, and it looks similar to the retoned RAW example I posted. The retoning, caused the unrecoverable parts of the sky to become yellowed, which I would consider an undesirable outcome. Depending on the software used, that may or may not happen. Something also not visible in the very small JPEG examples are compression artifacts, which have a tendency to become more pronounced as you rework an image, limiting your options.</p>

<h2>Detailed Example:</h2>

<p>Something else that I was able to recover from was a severe degree of softness, caused by the 18mm extreme of the cheap EF-S 18-55mm lens I used when I took this shot. I have some crops below that demonstrate the original image, a sharpened copy of the JPEG using a <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1370/unsharp-mask-what-do-the-parameters-do/1377#1377"">technique explained by @Guffa here on Photo-SE</a>, and an HDR version that was only possible because with RAW, I could use Lightroom to export two additional alternative exposures 1.5EV from the original. Even using Guffa's excellent sharpening technique, the JPEG can't compare to the ability to create an HDR image from a single poorly-shot RAW image (these images are about 1/3 of their full resolution):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sggrR.png"" alt=""Original""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ya4l.png"" alt=""Shrpened""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jviCH.png"" alt=""HDR""></p>

<p>And another example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R9y3a.png"" alt=""Original""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LIRkt.png"" alt=""Sharpened""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MxK2l.png"" alt=""HDR""></p>

<p>The HDR examples were not sharpened using any normal sharpening technique; the added sharpness was the result of Photoshop's image alignment during Merge to HDR.</p>

<h1>UPDATE: Two years forward</h1>

<p>It has been over two years since I originally posted this answer. Cameras have changed, tools have changed, and the power of RAW only becomes more evident as time continues to march on. With the advent of Sony Exmor sensors, low-ISO dynamic range in the shadows has become legendary. The Nikon D800 allows unparalleled shadow recovery that exhibits barely any noise at all and good color fidelity. Not owning a D800 myself, I can't provide any of my own samples. Fred Miranda, fame of fredmiranda.com, has provided one of the best examples of the power of RAW in the form of shadow recovery, <a href=""http://www.fredmiranda.com/5DIII-D800/index_controlled-tests.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">comparing the D800 and the 5D III</a>. The results in his examples are stunning to say the least.</p>

<p>For all the bad rap it tends to get these days in light of the D800, Canon shouldn't be forgotten. Before shadow recovery became a ""thing"", RAW was all about highlight recovery. Far more levels are allocated to highlights in a RAW image to start with, and the recovery power when dealing with overexposed highlights has always been pretty impressive. I encountered a series of photographs I'd taken of a dragonfly today that were terribly overexposed. I was sure they were all gonners, as I'm sure almost anyone would:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kp93T.jpg"" alt=""OVEREXPOSED!""></p>

<p>Just about everything in the shot above appears blown. The background, which was roughly an even midtone in real life, looks completely white. Imagine my surprise when I decided to at least give some exposure and highlight recovery a try. After -4 EV of exposure recovery and about 60% highlight recovery, I was shocked to see this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bkKdv.jpg"" alt=""Mind blowing recovery!""></p>

<p>I've heard of such highlight recovery before, although generally only in discussions regarding medium format digital cameras (particularly Hasselblads, which have legendary highlight recovery.) Even the specular highlights in the dragonfly's wings seem to have retained considerable detail (100% highlight recovery detail below):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8zSTR.jpg"" alt=""Recovery Detail""></p>

<p>Since the photo was overexposed by about 4 stops, the shadows have full color fidelity, zero color noise, and hardly any random noise. With my previous examples, one of the commenters to this answer was able to do some recovery with a JPEG version of the image. With the original overexposed copy of this new sample, its highly doubtful that any amount of ""recovery"" could be performed on a JPEG. RAW is simply pure, unadulterated post-processing power...and it keeps getting better.</p>

<p>Should I consider 35mm or instead buy a 55-200mm for better range?</p>
","<p>Yes. Prime lenses usually offer both superior image quality and larger apertures compared to zoom lenses of similar price. This is due to simpler mechanical construction, as less moving parts are needed, and due to especially chromatic aberration being easier to correct for just one focal length.</p>

<p>The decision between 35mm and 55-200mm is in the end about your needs - 35mm lens gets you close to the 50mm-on-full-frame that has often been considered as the ""neutral"" focal length, and the one to use if you need to pick just one. Also, fast prime gives you ability to shoot concerts and other performances, and different kinds of indoor events in general.</p>

<p>55-200mm gives you more reach, and can be useful if you want to capture small details outdoors, or get perspective flattened up.</p>

"How to take fast-shutter-speed photos that aren't dark?","50973","","<p>I was taking pictures of some water splashes. I knew I needed a fast shutter speed to make them look frozen in time.</p>

<p>I have not used manual mode yet. I use the settings where I can pick the shutter speed and the camera picks the appropriate aperture (and vice versa).</p>

<p>I am using the Canon 60D. My only lens currently is the 18-200mm kit lens.</p>

<p>I set the shutter speed to about 2000. The picture overall looked good but the splash wasn't as sharp as I would have liked it. (I did not use a tripod but I held it pretty steady and my lens has IS)</p>

<p>So I switched to the max shutter speed of 8000, I do not know how sharp it was, because the picture was too dark to see any detail.</p>

<p>Why is this? It was midday, a little gloomy but still decent daylight. I know I could possibly have made it brighter by raising the ISO but I don't want the photo to look noisy either.</p>
","<p>When you set a shutter speed, the camera will increase and decrease the aperture to match the desired shutter speed. If your aperture is maxed out on either end, it'll over/under expose the image. There are a few newer cameras that have an auto-ISO feature, which will attempt to expand the range, but without knowing what kind of camera you have, I can't tell you if you have that feature or not.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to counteract underexposing, if this is the effect.</p>

<ol>
<li>Increase the ISO. This is the easiest, cheapest, and likely best way to improve performance, but might increase the noise.</li>
<li>Increase the light. This can be done by waiting for better sunlight, external lighting, or even flash.</li>

"What can a fisheye lens be useful for?","48533","","<p>I have a variety of lenses in my camera kit. One that I do not have, and has me curious, is a fisheye lens. I mostly understand what it does: it captures an image with distortion similar to what you see through a door's peephole.</p>

<p>Given the distortion, are there any particular types of shots for which a fisheye lens is useful?</p>
","<p>When I started considering the purchase of a fisheye lens I was worried that I wouldn't use too often. Boy, was I wrong. I loved it so much that it actually gave me motivation to take more pictures and it grew to be my favorite lens. Unfortunately I had to sell it when I switched to a full frame camera and now I miss it a lot.  </p>

<p>First of all let's start by clarifying that there are two types of fisheye lenses for SLR cameras:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Circular - this one usually has a 180° (even more with some lenses) field of view and creates a circular, strongly distorted image in the center of the frame.</p></li>
<li><p>Full-frame - this one has slightly narrower (180° diagonally) field of view and produces an image that covers the whole frame with much less distortion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both types produce images that are significantly distorted but that is either is exactly what you want or it can be corrected with the software, but it certainly doesn't have to look as what you see through a door's peephole.  Situation that I think a fisheye lens is useful are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Close distance sport/action shots - people jumping on bikes, skateboards, snowboard or skis. Fisheye gives a very cool feeling of immersion in that type of shots. I wish I had taken more of those.  </p></li>
<li><p>Landscape - when all the objects are far away from the camera it is possible to minimize the fisheye appearance by putting the horizon in the center of your image like I tried in the shots below:  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/piotrzurek/2155188753/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Sunset from Gannet's POV by Piotr Zurek, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2153/2155188753_000e686aee_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""161"" alt=""Sunset from Gannet's POV"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/piotrzurek/1340184862/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""New Chums by Piotr Zurek, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1311/1340184862_7d69fa74fe_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""161"" alt=""New Chums"" /></a></p>

<p>Personally, I'd rather stick to rectilinear wide-angle lenses (like the Nikkor 14-24) for landscape but fisheye can really produce a very compelling result as well. </p></li>
<li><p>Interiors/panoramas - fisheye helps shooting in confined spaces. Most professional shots of car or plane interiors are done with fisheye lenses and occasionally stitched together in 360° panoramas. Using a fisheye for panoramas allows to take less shots to cover the whole view.  </p></li>
<li><p>Other situations where wide field of view is important. Sometimes choosing a good point of view will allow you to reduce the distortion to a point where it doesn't require software correction.   </p>

","<p>Most of the noise is actually not the shutter, but the mirror folding up.</p>

<p>My camera actually have two different ways of reducing this noise somewhat:</p>

<li><p>You can use live view for taking pictures. That folds up the mirror, opens the shutter and shows the image on the LCD screen. When you take an image the shutter closes, then acts normally for taking the image, then opens again for live view.</p></li>

<p>NimH life can be enhanced substantially by never discharging them fully on any occasion. Even when using multiple sets during a day's shooting, if you can manage to leave the last 10% or so of capacity in the battery you will get substantially longer life from them. Similarly, if you do not charge them quite to capacity it will also extend lifetime. The latter is harder to do but, if you are able to monitor your charger and if you use a ""fast charger"" (around 1 hour for a full charge) then you will find that the batteries are very hot at the end of charge. If you stop charging when the battery temperature first starts to increase rapidly they will thank you for it longer term.</p>

<p>If you discharge to only say 50% ever you get more than 2X life cycles so a net whole of life gain in capacity per dollar. eg IF you get 500 cycles deep discharge (and it varies) you may get 1200-1500 cycles of 50% discharge.<br>
 500 x 100%  = 500 cycles.<br>
 1200 - 1500 x 50% = 600 - 750 full cycles equivalent. </p>

<p><strong>NO memory effect in Nimh batteries -</strong> One problem with NiCd batteries was that repeated partial discharge caused ""memory effect"" and the batteries lost capacity. Much has been written on this over many years. Modern NimH batteries do NOT have memory effect to an extent that you will ever notice. If you repeatedly carefuill dischartged them to exactly the same point mutiple times you may find that there was a very very small reduction in available capacity. But this is removed as soon as you discharge them to any other point and then recharge them. It is not an issue of any concern at all. So effectively this means that you NEVER need to discharge your NimH cells, and you should try to avoid doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Note that modern NimH cells MUST NOT BE TRICKLE CHARGED.</strong><br>
Trickle charging modern NimH cells at even VERY modest rates will very greatly shorten their lifetime. Older cells could be trickle charged safely at C/20 or even higher in some cases. Modern ones cannot. (C/20 = mAh/20. Si C/20 for a 2000 mAh cell = 2000/20 = 100 mA).</p>

<p>Older NimH AA cells (up to about 1500 to 1800 mAh capacity) had inbuilt arrangements for recombining generated gases during overcharging. The drive to achieve maximum capacity has resulted in this mechanism being removed from modern cells. ANY overcharging will result in gas generation. This will cause pressure relief valves to operate and the gas and so the water content will be lost. The battery will rapidly dry out and die. As a ""bonus"" the venting gas will carry some corrosive liquid with it which may damage associated equipment. </p>

<p><strong>Charging NimH:</strong></p>

<p>For AA and AAA cells I recommend the <a href=""http://www.mahaenergy.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=423"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Powerex MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer.</strong></a><br>
 Despite the silly name this is a superb device. Shop around - price varies quite widely.<br>
 The C9000 will charge, discharge, analyse, cycle and ""recondition"" NimH AA and AAA cells. It provides charge rates up to 2A/cell and discharge rates up to 1A/cell. This device is not perfect but is far better than all except a few chargers in this class that I am aware of. They are Taiwanese made. I use one personally and thought enough of them to buy one to take to China to give to a factory to assist them in battery testing.</p>

<p>The following advice, quoted from the <a href=""http://www.batteries4less.com/contents/Battery_Guide/cell-phone-battery-care.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Batteries for less</a>    page which Eshwar cited, is incorrect. Not his fault of course. :-) But, it will not do too much harm. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><s>NiMH Batteries need to be deep cycled once every 3 months or every 40 charge cycles to prevent the 'memory effect'. This is recommended for all Ni-MH batteries.</s></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The initial conditioning cycles that they recommend also do little harm but are of arguable use. A NimH cell <strong>will</strong> be of low capacity for the first 1 to 3 cycles. (I have seen many cells assume very close to full capacity by the 2nd cycle. ) </p>

"When do the differences between APS-C and full frame sensors matter, and why?","47166","","<p>I'm trying to decide on a higher-end digital SLR, and I'm down to choosing between an APS-C model and a full-frame model.</p>

<p>I understand that the sensors are of different sizes, and as such have an effect on the perceived magnification of the lens, with the smaller APS-C sensor having an effective focal length greater than what it otherwise would be with a full frame sensor. But why does this matter?  </p>

<ul>
<li>What things should drive my choice between one or the other?  </li>
<li>In which situations is one better than the other, and why?</li>
</ul>
","<ul>
<li>One major difference is that a FF camera produces a depth of field that's around 1.3 stops shallower than an APS-C camera <em>for the same subject &amp; framing</em>. This is most important when you have the aperture as wide as possible, e.g. for portraiture. To replicate the look of a 50 f/1.4 lens you'd have to use something like a 31 f/0.9 lens, which doesn't as far as I know exist!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/FF_vs_APS-C.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/FF_vs_APS-C.jpg</a></p>

<p>Quick and dirty comparison image, APS-C Canon 30D left, FF Canon 5D right, same lens (FF image was zoomed in, however to give the same field of view), same composition, both f/2.8</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Another difference is that if you're using a lens designed for a full frame camera (like all Canon EF lenses) you are making full use of the image circle, which is less demanding of the optics and so you can expect a sharper image <em>for the same number of megapixels</em>. It's true that some lenses get softer toward the edge of the image, but you will still get higher average sharpness with most lenses, and telephotos will be sharper right across the frame. The crop factor of APS-C cameras takes the middle out of the lens and blows it up, losing sharpness in the process in a similar manner to a teleconverter.</p></li>
<li><p>Larger formats allow for sharper optics. One of the driving forces for larger formats (other than the relatively constant resolving power per unit area of film) has been that it allows lenses to be produced which resolve a greater number of line pairs per picture height. Going full frame on a DSLR benefits from this to an extend - see: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/3370/with-all-other-things-equal-in-a-dslr-will-a-larger-sensor-produce-a-sharper-im/3373#3373"">With all other things equal, in a DSLR, will a larger sensor produce a sharper image?</a></p></li>
<li><p>A bigger sensor means bigger pixels, which in turn means you capture more light <em>usually</em> achieving lower noise levels in the process. Greater dynamic range goes hand in hand with this.</p></li>
<li><p>You get a larger, brighter viewfinder on a full frame camera, which can be helpful composing shots. Having said that, I personally find the 5D viewfinder <em>too large</em>, I've not used a 7D but it has a very high spec 'finder.</p></li>
<li><p>You have more mirror to move on a full frame camera. The larger mirror used to mean shooting speed is limited (the mirror on my 5D moves so slowly I can actually see the world slide sideways/up for an instant) however high speed full frame models are now available.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise the mirror box, focussing screen and pentaprism are larger, meaning the camera is larger and heavier.</p></li>
<li><p>Lens hoods are designed for FF image circle and are therefore <em>slightly</em> more effective on FF cameras. This mostly applies to prime lenses, as zoom lens hoods are designed cut to accommodate the widest zoom setting, so everything else is already non optimal. If you're using an EF lens on a crop camera you ideally want the hood tighter (since the extra shading will lie outside the smaller sensor a tighter hood wont vignette.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have nothing against APS-C cameras but for any format it makes sense to use lenses designed for your sensor size. The range of EF-S lenses is smaller than the range of EF lenses. However for some uses (sports etc.) the smaller sensor size is helpful for the extra reach and speed it allows. Also the better noise characteristics of a FF sensor don't quite make up for the higher ISO you need to use get the same exposure when stopping down to match the DOF as a crop. So if you have to maximise DOF crop has a <em>slight</em> edge.</p>

<p>If there are EF-S lenses available for what you want to shoot then it wont be noticeably worse choosing this camera. However I feel full frame gives you more flexibility (speed aside) - as you can get the same deep DOF as a crop, but go narrower if you need to.</p>

"What is the difference between Canon's black inks?","46962","","<p>My Canon MP560 printer requires one <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001CSMJKI"" rel=""noreferrer"">PGI-220BK</a> black cartridge and one <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001CSO794"" rel=""noreferrer"">CLI-221BK</a> black cartridge (which is a part of a CMYK bunch). What is the difference between the two?</p>
","<p>The difference is in the kind of ink particle...the dye or pigment. In your case, PGI-* are pigment inks, and CLI-* are dye (ChromaLife 100 year) inks.</p>

<p>Dye inks use dye particles, which are soluble substances. Dye particles tend to be smaller than pigments, lay flatter on the surface of papers, and are often a bit more vibrant in the way they reflect light (which can actually be a detriment, rather than a bonus, when trying to print color-accurate photos.) Dye inks tend to do quite well on glossy papers and do not usually exhibit gloss differential. Dyes, as they are soluble, tend to have shorter lifetimes. </p>

<p>Pigment inks use pigment particles, which are insoluble substances simply suspended in solution. Pigment particles are larger, and can often lay unevenly on paper. Pigment inks can also exhibit certain effects such as metamerism, bronzing and gloss differential, however these days pigment inks are highly advanced, and such problems are mitigated to their minimums. Pigments also tend to be more controllable than dyes, and an extensive range of pigment inks is available for high quality pigment-based ink jet printers. Gamut and overall color quality that can be achieved by full pigment ink printers is second to none these days. Pigments, being non-soluble (and given their significant technological advances over the recent years), tend to have significantly longer lifetimes than dye inks.</p>

<p>The particular printer you have is not really known as a high quality photographic printer in the grand scheme of things. It probably has a pigment black ink to improve the permanence of text printouts, and possibly to support matte papers better (which have a tendency to absorb dye inks a bit too much, washing out the color.) The dye is probably used to support gloss better, as pigment ink usually causes a gloss differential...if pigment black is used on gloss with the dye colors, it usually leaves quite noticeable gloss differential for all the black (text, lines, etc.)</p>

<p>Class 4 isn't <em>that fast</em> by today's standards, and actually equates to 4MB/s read/write speeds. The two cards you pointed out are compatible with SDHC, but are much much faster, and even way out of the current class leagues. They rate them as 300x or 45MB/s read/write.</p>

"Are mirror lenses good for wildlife photography in daylight?","46419","","<p>I've recently seen these Rokinon/Opteka mirror lens with whooping focal length (like 500mm, 600mm, 800mm, 1000mm) at a cheap price. And I have seen some of their same pictures in Flickr and vendor sites. But the only thing is that they usually starts from smaller aperture (f/5.6 and upwards) </p>

<p>Now what I was wondering, as they are cheap with quite good IQ - are they good for any bird photography or wild life photography in proper daylight?</p>
","<p>There are several related questions here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are mirror lenses good at all (opinion)  </p></li>
<li><p>Are mirror lenses good for wldlife shots in daylight.  </p></li>
<li><p>Are cheap mirror lenses value for money.</p></li>

<p><strong>Relevant:</strong> <em>I own a Minolta 500mm AF f8 ""Reflex"" lens- the only model of AF ""mirror"" lens ever made AFAIK and one of the better quality ones around. I think that as long as you accept its known limitations of fixed aperture, fixed focal length and different than refractor-bokeh then it's utterly marvellous.</em> </p>

<p>(1) <strong>Are mirror lenses good at all (opinion)</strong></p>

<p>It's largely a matter of what you think of their <strong>Bokeh</strong> - aka out of focus background.<br>
 MiKe W says ""The out of focus background will be poor. Horrible donut-shaped bokeh"".<br>
 This is partially only selectively true and partially a matter of taste. Bright point sources outside the depth of field range do create ""donut"" shaped images which are characteristic of mirror lenses. <a href=""http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=mirror+lense+donut+bokeh&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=6-FdT6K7CYaRiQf5vpSaDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CAwQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1038#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=mirror+lens+donut+bokeh&amp;oq=mirror+lens+donut+bokeh&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=3&amp;gs_upl=2673597l2673597l0l2674730l1l1l0l0l0l0l300l300l3-1l1l0&amp;gs_l=img.3...2673597l2673597l0l2674730l1l1l0l0l0l0l300l300l3-1l1l0&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=fdf092af5ce1559d&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1038"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">View many many examples across the range here</a>. This can look downright nasty - ie dominate the image unintentionally , or be an intended part of the ""image as art form"" OR can be entirely pleasantly acceptable.  The latter is entirely a matter of my personal opinion and I am aware that some people will never accept that a donut element in the boken is acceptable. This is a matter of opinion and, as in most things, where the law does not disallow it, opinions are free and allowed.  Such people are, by definition, ""bokeh donut snobs"" (just as people who insist you MUST ONLY EVER drink long blacks are coffee snobs) and the argument is not worth having from either point of view. If you like the result and people who you hope will like the result <strong>do</strong> like it, then the result is fine. If you want to win competitions that are judged by donut hating boken snobs then the donuts are not fine.</p>

<p>BUT about 10 minutes serious playing with a mirror lens will show you that in most cases strong and explicit donuts can be avoided inmost cases by controlling image content. </p>

<p>Along the way  you get images  like the one below whose bokeh is a clear product of a mirror lens if you know what to look for. But most people would look at that image and see narry a ""donut"". If you do and you don't like the effect then you are entirely entitled to your opinion, you're a bokeh donut snob, nothing to see here, move along please. Image used with permission: </p>

<p>(2) Are mirror lenses good for wldlife shots in daylight.  </p>

<p>That's easier.<br>
 As long as f5.6 or f8 is acceptable then yes.<br>

 I travel overseas reasonably often on business. I take an 18-250 f3.5-5.6, a 50mm f1.8 and my 500mm f8. The latter gets least use of the three BUT when I do use it I am very very pleased to have it.</p>

<p>(3) Are cheap mirror lenses value for money.<br>
 This is definitely subjective but, in my opinion <strong>IN SOME CASES</strong> the answer is, sadly, no. The quality of all lenses is of course variable and of course somewhat governed by price, but I have seen some cheap mirror lenses whose quality of image was worse than you'd get from an entry level kit lens. Which is not good enough. I'm not familiar with brands, but you can assess IQ independently of the above factors and decide if it's adequate.

","<p>Likely culprits, in order of probability:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad SD card (by far the most likely, especially with cheap cards).</li>
<li>Bad cable or card reader (more common than you might think).</li>
<li>Something wrong on your computer (many things can go wrong!).</li>
<li>A bad connection inside the camera.</li>
<li>Something horribly wrong with the camera's electronics. </li>
</ul>

<p>The ""bad card"" scenario is, unfortunately, the most likely, and in that case the pictures are lost. <strong>If it is just the reader or cable, transferring the files again might work</strong> — but you've probably already tried that. Checking on a completely separate computer is another good diagnostic step. </p>

<p>If you reformat the card, it <em>might</em> work fine in the future, but I sure wouldn't trust it.</p>

<p>I buy only brand-name pro-level cards. They're more expensive (possibly exploitatively so) but I think the extra quality guarantee is worth it. </p>

<p><strong>And, sadly, you can't really fix them after the fact. Blocks of data are damaged or missing, and there's no magical way to undo that. If the problem is at a different point in the chain, though, like the USB cable, you may be able to replace that and try again.</strong></p>

<p>In some cases, you can crop and stitch and color-correct bits of the image back into a coherent image resembling the whole. In your first example, you may be able to save the key part of the image — the kid:</p>

<p>There's a seam running right through the face, though, and I didn't spent much time trying to reconstruct that. If the image is irreplaceable, you might put in that time — otherwise, get a new card and get the child to go down the slide again.</p>

I was able to read the card and transfer the photo files to my computer drive. Today, the same thing happened again, just that nearing the capacity of the card, it failed one last time and the camera was subsequently unable to read it anymore. Despite reinsertion.</p>

<p>My other CF cards never once exhibited this problem, so it's pretty much isolated to this card.</p>

<p>The card is similarly unrecognisable on my computer CF card reader. I think the filesystem is toast, but I suspect the photo files are still intact. I would like to find ways where I can inspect the raw binary data in the card and hopefully recover the photos?</p>

"What is the difference between UV and Skylight filters?","45630","","<p>I was used to put a Skylight filter to protect my lens, but last time the shop assistant recommended me to use a UV filter instead for Digital SLR.</p>

<p>I though they were the same, only different in ""strength"" but he told me no, Skylight would introduce false colors in digital sensors.</p>

<p>Is it true?</p>

<p>What's the exact difference between them?</p>
","<p>The difference is that a skylight filter is a basic colour correction filter with a slight magenta tint which has a similar effect on skies as a UV filter (which cuts out part of the spectrum), which is neutral coloured. The effect of a skylight filter is slightly warming, overcoming the blue tinge that you get in shadows from the light from a clear blue sky.</p>

<p>The person is the shop is right that a skylight will affect colours but the effect is subtle, can be beneficial and can be largely reversed on the computer. However skylight filters are less common with digital given the ease with which you can apply colour correction in post production. </p>

<p>A more important question is why you are buying a filter. The common advice for protecting a lens doesn't make sense to me, given that filters can exacerbate lens flare and reduce contrast in certain circumstances. The price if a good UV filter can be about the same as a lens repair anyway... </p>

</ul>

<p>In this case, the L version is much better built, 50% heavier, with better image stabilizer, more sophisticated optical construction, weather sealing, ring-type USM with full-time manual (consumer version has just micro-USM motor). Optically the L version performs better than the non-L, but not as good as EF 70-200 f/4 L IS, and nowhere as good as €400 EF-S 60mm macro lens.</p>

<p>Additionally, the L telephoto lenses are white, which is meant to reduce chance its insides overheat on the sun as well as tell everyone around you have a Canon L lens.</p>

<p>Overall: L lens will be heavier, optically and mechanically better, and more expensive than similar non-L lens. This does not mean it will outperform everything else regardless of lens type.</p>

","<p>It means ""through the lens"" and generally it hooks your flash into the exposure system of the camera since the metering of the scene is through the lens. This allows the camera to exert control over the flash, including power, distance, etc. based on the scene and focal length, if the flash supports that functionality with your camera. Usually true for modern flashes made by the camera manufacturer and some third party options such as Metz.</p>

You can get a little extra quality from processing the raw differently (I'm intentionally excluding post-raw conversion editing) but far more quality from how you setup the shot. Change in lighting, filters, angle, exposure, etc. can dramatically improve a picture more than subtle raw conversion improvements.</p>

"Practical Difference Between Nikon 80-200 f/2.8 and 70-200 f/2.8?","43531","","<p>As a photographer for my college's newspaper, most of what I shoot is either low light (concerts, dances, etc.) or sports, so I'm looking into getting a low-light/high speed telephoto zoom for my Nikon D7000. I already have a 35mm f/1.8 that I use for most low-light photography when I have the opportunity to get close to my subject, but I can't always get a press pass for campus events (passes are handled by individual campus clubs who don't always respond to emails), and so I often wish I had some zoom besides my kit 55-200 (from a D40 kit several years ago) that would still be clear in low-light.</p>

<p>I've come across two lenses by Nikon that seem to be mostly the same for my purposes: The <a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/zoom/telephotozoom/zoom80-200mmf_28d/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AF 80-200mm f/2.8D ED</a>, and the <a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/zoom/telephotozoom/af-s_70-200mmf_28g_vr2/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AF-S 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II</a>. I ask, because there's nearly a $1300 dollar difference between them: Is there a practical difference between these two lenses?</p>

<p>I'm aware of the obvious technical differences, AF vs AF-S, and the lack of VR on the 80-200, but I was curious if either of these features made a practical difference in focus speed and usability. From what I understand, on my D7000, the AF vs AF-S shouldn't make a difference, but is VR really worth the extra $1300?</p>

<p>On a related note, I've also heard some people mention cheaper Sigma and Tamron lenses in the same focal range and aperture size, and I was curious what some of the differences would be between those and their Nikon equivalents?</p>
","<p>I used that 80-200 for quite a few years, and currently use the first iteration of the the 70-200.</p>

<p>I think the 80-200 is a steal! It's optically very good, built well, and focuses quickly on a capable body. I don't hesitate to recommend it in the least. (Regarding autofocus: on an N65 and D50 it's not <em>slow</em> to focus, but it's clearly not fast. On an F100, D70, D200, and D300 it focuses quickly. I don't know how the AF motor of the D7000 compares.)</p>

<p>The 70-200 is a great step beyond the 80-200. With AF-S it clearly focuses faster, VR is a big advantage, and optically it is also clearly superior. A fantastic lens, and I think it's worth the price. I don't have experience with the current ""II"" iteration of the lens, but based on other reviews I think it's equally excellent.</p>

<p>Is it worth the price difference? On a great day, shooting in ideal conditions and stopped down, I would say that no the 70-200 is not worth an extra $1300. Want to shoot wide open in difficult conditions with continuous-focusing action with questionable shutter speeds -- go for the 70-200 and you'll enjoy the outing more.</p>

"What is the ""exposure triangle""?","43370","","<p>What is the exposure triangle? How do the ""sides"" affect my photographs?</p>
","<p>""The Exposure Triangle"" is a catchy phrase meant to encompass the three factors which affect the exposure of a photograph of a scene with a given amount of light. It's often given to new photographers as a learning aid. I'm not sure if he invented it, but it is certainly popularized by Bryan Peterson, as in his book <em>Understanding Exposure</em>. (The popular web site Steve's Digicams <a href=""http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/photography-techniques/understanding-the-exposure-triangle.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">gives Peterson credit for the term</a>, as do <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=QxMO5h2000EC&amp;lpg=PT162&amp;dq=%22Exposure%20triangle%22&amp;pg=PT162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""noreferrer"">other authors</a>.)</p>

<p>The three factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shutter-speed?sort=faq"">Shutter</a> — how long you let light in</li>
<li><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aperture?sort=faq"">Aperture</a> — how large of an opening you let light through (how much at once)</li>
<li><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iso?sort=faq"">ISO</a>  — how sensitive your film or sensor is to light</li>
</ul>

<p>Each factor is interchangeable in terms of exposure, so that a decrease or increase in one factor must be met by the same amount of change in another.  (More on this below!) And each has intrinsic secondary effects on your composition — longer and shorter shutter speeds freeze or blur motion, smaller apertures give more depth of focus, and generally higher ISO causes more noise as one attempts to get more signal out of less light.</p>

<p><strong>The problem with the phrase ""exposure triangle"" is that the relationship between these three factors does not actually share any of the properties of a triangle other than ""threeness"". That makes it a bad analogy, which can introduce more confusion than necessary, as new photographers attempt to reason from the information they've learned.</strong></p>

<p>Let's say we have a triangle where the sides (or corners — it doesn't matter) represent a shutter speed of ¹/₆₀th, aperture of f/11, and ISO 100. We draw a triangle, and we label that ""Properly Exposed for EV 13"". (See the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on EV</a> for where the value ""13"" comes from). So far, so good — we've got our triangle.</p>

<p>Now, what if we want to change the shutter speed to ¹⁄₃₀th, and the aperture to f/16? That should give the same exposure. But what happens to our triangle? Do we double the size of one line, and halve the other? Or is there some other relationship that's meaningful?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHWAp.png"" alt=""Exposure Triangle Fail""></p>

<p>It doesn't take much mucking about with a pencil and paper to determine that, <strong>no, this just breaks down</strong>. If you attach any actual meaning to the dimensions of the sides or the angles of the corners, not only is there no relationship to the area or size of the triangle, many settings yield impossible triangles even though they're perfectly valid exposure settings.</p>

<p>An alternate approach would be to leave the triangle's geometry constant, and put labels along the sides. This is somewhat more useful for thinking about the non-exposure effects of the parameters, but fails on actually showing anything about exposure. (And worse, may cause confusion by implying a linkage between the factors where they come together at the corners — how does bokeh connect with motion blur?)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGDTm.png"" alt=""Triangle Attempt, Take Two""></p>

<p>Basically, it'd be just as useful to say The Exposure Clover, or The Exposure Tricycle, or the The Exposure Set of Juggling Balls. Or the Exposure Branches of the U.S. Government, although that may be harder to draw in an intro-to-photography book. I humbly submit the following illustration for anyone's use; I'll leave the other suggestions as an exercise.</p>

<p>(But I'm not ending with unhelpful sarcasm, I promise. Keep reading below.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1LMUi.png"" alt=""The Exposure Tricycle""></p>

<p>I'm joking, but I'm also serious: there's nothing particularly useful about the triangle for explaining these factors, and in fact it might be detrimental. So, we might as well use something funny, if the only point is to be memorable and associated with the number three.</p>

<p><strong><em>If you're not fond of math and details, you can stop right here.</em></strong> Just remember:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are <strong>three exposure factors you can change on your camera</strong>, assuming fixed lighting in the scene.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to darken or lighten the resulting image, you can change any one of the three</strong> (up until the inherent limits of each factor). For example, if you want to brighten an image taken at <em>ISO 400, f/8, and shutter speed ¹⁄₁₂₀th of a second</em> by one stop, you could change any one factor: ISO to <em>800</em>, aperture to <em>f/5.6</em>, or shutter to <em>¹⁄₆₀th</em>. (If you change <em>all three</em>, that'd make a <em>three stop</em> change, of course.) </li>
<li><strong>If you want to keep the exposure the same but change a factor, you can change <em>either</em> of the other two factors in the <em>opposite</em> direction.</strong> So, for the example of <em>ISO 400, f/8, ¹⁄₁₂₀th</em>, if you wanted to freeze motion better with a shutter of ¹⁄₂₄₀th, you could keep the exposure the same by changing either ISO to 800 or aperture to f/5.6.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Or</em>, (if you <em>are</em> interested in thinking of this geometrically) we can use a better representation: <strong>The Exposure <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cuboid</a></strong> — a rectangular box. That sounds nerdier and not nearly as catchy, but it has the advantage of actually being useful. Each dimension — width, length, height — corresponds to one of the exposure factors, and the volume of the box corresponds to the the exposure.</p>

<p>This works out exactly right. Each of the three settings can be adjusted independently, and a doubling of any of them doubles the overall exposure — or cutting one in half cuts the overall exposure by half. This is just the same way that changing the length of one of the sides of a box changes its volume. So, we get both a visual analogy <em>and</em> an accurate mathematical representation.</p>

<p>And it's nice from a simplicity point of view, because we can start by leaving off one of the dimensions. If one were using this as a tool to actually explain exposure, we'd start with shutter speed and aperture alone — that's a (plain old regular two-dimensional) rectangle. <strong><em>The Exposure Rectangle</em></strong> still isn't quite as catchy as <em>triangle</em>, but at least everyone knows what a rectangle is, too.</p>

<p>Take some graph paper, and mark off shutter speeds along one side. Start at, say, ¹⁄₂₅₀th at the first mark, then double that time to ¹⁄₁₂₅th at the second mark, and then ¹⁄₆₀th at the <em>fourth</em> mark, and ¹⁄₃₀th at the <em>eighth</em>, ¹⁄₁₅th at the <em>sixteenth</em>, and so on. Actual doubling of time is directly represented by actual doubling of space. We'll get to the concept of ""stops"" in a bit. (And you'll notice that the number sequence I'm using isn't exactly doubling — for whatever analog-days reason, this is the standard sequence and it isn't exactly precise. That's another chapter, really — at this point, just consider it rounded-off and close enough.)</p>

<p>Along the other axis, we'll mark apertures. Start at the first mark with something small, like f/22. Then, follow the standard sequence of aperture values from there, <em>again</em> making sure to double for each rather than just marking each square — so, f/16 at the second mark, f/11 at the fourth, f/8 at the eighth, f/5.6 at the sixteenth, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, you can <em>directly visualize</em> the effect of increasing or decreasing one of the factors. The exposure of the scene is the area. Any combination of aperture and shutter speed which gives a rectangle of the same area will give the same exposure. Doubling the shutter speed actually doubles the exposure, just as one would expect.</p>

<p>If you draw a rectangle with one corner at the origin and going out to ¹/₆₀th and f/11, with the labels as above, you get a 4×4 rectangle — area 16. (Here, the actual number 16 is just an artifact of how we decided to start our labeling and the size of the squares — the actual number is meaningless.) Change to ¹⁄₃₀th and f/16, and it's 8×2, or ¹⁄₁₂₅th and f/8 for 2×8 — either way, still the same area.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uW0pI.png"" alt=""The Exposure Rectangle""></p>

<p>And adding in the third factor, ISO, is simply extending this to the third dimension. This is harder to draw on paper or put in a book, but once you have the idea of the rectangle down, it's not a far leap conceptually. Imagine an ISO axis extending upward out from your page, labeled similarly to the others. The exposure value becomes the volume of the cuboid, and pretty much everything works the same way.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LUgwm.png"" alt=""The Exposure Cuboid""></p>

<p>Another convenience is that shutter-priority or aperture-priority modes can be visualized as flat rectangles within the 3D box. Turn it so whatever two values are adjustable are conveniently aligned.</p>

<p>But a problem with this is that the paper — or cuboid — gets big pretty quickly. And those big areas get cumbersome to work with. That's where the concept of ""stops"" comes in. Rather than working with linear labels and area, we can work in a logarithmic space based on powers of two. That might sound intimidating, but it simply means that we count the <em>number of doublings</em>, rather than using the direct numbers. Again, sounds like I'm using too many big words, but the great thing is that <em>counting is easy</em>. In fact, you don't even have to count — every modern camera has a meter which ""weighs"" these things automatically and tells you how many stops you are off. Just like a balance scale.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ScINL.png"" alt=""The Exposure Balance""></p>

<p>That loses out on the concept of ""threeness"" entirely, and it feels a bit unnatural to add things to <em>darken</em> exposure. Someone spending a lot of time thinking about which direction is up isn't really learning the important part. It also doesn't cover flash duration properly. And I sure did end up putting way too much explanatory text there. That's problematic for an introductory diagram (although I'm sure with some work it could be cleaner).</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is: it's catchy to say ""triangle"", and since there's three factors, it seems obviously true, garnering automatic nods from people who are familiar with the concepts already. And for many people it's pretty harmless. However, there's a <em>more useful</em> geometric explanation which can actually be used to show how the factors <em>really relate</em>. The cuboid may feel like jumping in the deep end, but the rectangle shouldn't be too intimidating, and going on to the third dimension is a natural progression in the lesson.</p>

<p>If that seems too complicated, why bother with a geometric analogy at all? I know that in the last few years it's become a common idea and Peterson's books are very popular. I know many people even find it helpful. I'm not <em>really</em> on a Quixotic crusade to make sure every use of ""the exposure triangle"" is actively stomped out — <strong>but I do recommend against introducing it to new users</strong>. Putting the three factors in a bullet-point list works just fine, and doesn't add any inadvertent confusion. <em>Or you can stick with the tricycle.</em></p>

<p>But when movement takes a point across several pixels during the exposure, it will be visible as movement blur, in this case star trails. A rule like the ""rule of 600"" is similar in spirit to the ""rule of 1/focal length"" for handheld exposure, in that it  attempts to give exposure times that yield approximately the same movement blur for most focal lengths.</p>

<p>The derivation is fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sky rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours, or 0.0042 arc degrees per second.</li>
<li>Assuming a full frame camera and a 24mm lens, we have a 73.7 degree horizontal view. (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view"">wikipedia's Angle of view article</a>.)</li>
<li>Assuming a 24 Mpx sensor (6000x4000, e.g. Nikon D600), those 73.7 degrees are projected on to 6000 horizontal pixels, giving 81.4 pixels per degree.</li>
<li>Assuming a 24mm lens, the ""rule of 600"" gives 600/24mm = 25 seconds exposure.</li>
<li>In 25 seconds the sky will move ~0.1 degrees.</li>
<li>For our 24 Mpx full frame camera with a 24mm lens, 0.1 degrees translates to 8.5 pixels. </li>
</ul>

<p>By the 600 rule, those 8.5 pixels represent the maximum acceptable movement blur before star points turn into star trails. (That's what the rule says. Whether an 8-pixel smear is acceptable for a particular purpose is a different discussion.)</p>

<p>If we plug a 400mm lens into the same formulas, we get max 1.5 seconds exposure time and a 7.3 pixels movement during the exposure. So it's not an exact rule - the blur is slightly different for different focal lengths - but as a rule of thumb it's pretty close.</p>

<p>If we were using a 1.5x crop sensor with the same 24Mpx resolution (e.g. Nikon D3200) and used focal lengths to give equivalent angles of view, we would have e.g. 16mm focal length, 37.5 seconds exposure time and 12.7 pixels blur. That's 50% more blur. </p>

<p>In this case a ""rule of 400"" for the crop sensor camera would give the same blur as the ""rule of 600"" for the full frame example. </p>

<p>I suggest using ""rule of 600"" (or a stricter version with a smaller numerator) with the equivalent rather than the actual focal length, that way the rule gives the same results for smaller sensors. <em>(E.g. 16mm on a 1.5x crop sensor is equivalent to 24mm on a full frame; use the ""24mm equivalent"" rather than the ""16mm actual"" focal length to calculate the max exposure time.)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Different stars move at different speeds relative to the Earth. The fastest movement is along the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole"">celestial equator</a>, while the Pole star (Polaris for the Northern hemisphere) at the celestial pole hardly moves at all.</p>

<p>The effect can be seen in this picture from wikimedia commons: Polaris appears as a fixed point in the middle while other stars revolve around it, and the length of the star trails increase with their distance from Polaris.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jA3HL.jpg"" alt=""Star trails around the celestial pole"">
<br><em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Trails_Shoreline.jpg"">Source</a></em></p>

<p>The calculation above is for the worst-case scenario, when the picture includes stars that move along the celestial equator. </p>

<hr>

<p>I guess the takeaway message is that the 600 in the ""rule of 600"" depends on camera resolution, sensor size, where in the sky you point the camera, and what you consider acceptable blur. </p>

<p>Use a smaller number if you want less blur.</p>

<p>Conversely, a higher number might be acceptable if you shoot a close crop of Polaris, use a low-resolution camera and/or target a low-resolution output format.</p>

"Cheap/free tool to view/convert Canon CR2 RAW format photo files on Windows?","42931","","<p>Recently, my family had some professional photos taken while vacationing at a resort.  The photos were given to us on CD in both <strong>.CR2</strong> and <strong>.jpg</strong> formats.</p>

<p>While we can view the JPEG-format versions of the photos just fine, they had some effect and color filters applied which we'd rather not have for some prints.  Consequently, I'd like to open the .CR2 files myself to get at the original unmodified photos.</p>

<p>I don't own a recent Canon camera, so I don't have the corresponding Canon software that undoubtedly ships with their RAW-capable cameras.  I tried Corel Paint Shop Pro X2, but it didn't recognize the .CR2 files.</p>

","<p>You can use any free (as in freedom) RAW processing software. I can recommend:</p>

<p><a href=""http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>UFRaw</strong></a></p>

"How do you photograph artwork in a glass picture frame?","42579","","<p>I'm trying to sell a picture of a piece of artwork for charity, and I'd like to photograph it. It's in a glass frame with lots of glare. Any ideas of what I can to to photograph it to look the absolute best? Thanks!</p>
","<p>When it comes to glass it's all about lighting direction.</p>

<p>You want to make sure that when you look at the picture through the camera neither the reflection of the lightsource <strong>or anything lit by your lightsource</strong> is visible. </p>

<p>Hold up, I'll draw a diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/lighting_glass.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/lighting_glass.png</a></p>

<p>Glass and other shiny objects reflect light back in one direction (like a ball bouncing off a wall). The painting, which is <em>diffuse</em> reflects some light this way, and reflects some light back in every direction.</p>

<p>In the setup above, the light from a directional source hits the glass and carries on, missing the camera, thus the glass isn't visible! The same light hits the painting and some of it does get reflected into the camera so the painting does show up.</p>

<p>The important thing is to use a directional source, as it's possible for light from your lightsource to bounce of a white wall, and hit the glass at an angle that does go down the lens, and this shows up as flare.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/lighting_glass2.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/lighting_glass2.png</a></p>

<p>This often happens when you have a white wall behind the camera, as in the above example.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is to make sure you can't see the reflection of the lightsource in the glass when stood behind the camera, and try to limit what the light hits (ideally it should hit nothing but the painting). You can make any lightsource directional by placing opaque objects around it to block the light in certain directions.</p>

"How many colors and shades can the human eye distinguish in a single scene?","42128","","<p>How many distinct colors, shades, hues, and tints can the average person distinguish in a single scene? In other words, what's the theoretical bit-depth required to be sure of recording a photograph with all of the visual information a human would perceive?</p>

<p>I've seen answers ranging from 200,000 to 20,000,000, and it's hard to sort out authority. And the term ""color"" is ambiguous — is just hue meant, or are differences in saturation and lightness also included?  </p>
","<p>When discussing the number of colors perceptible to the human eye, <strong>I tend to refer to the 2.4 million colors of the CIE 1931 XYZ color space.</strong> It is a fairly solid, scientifically founded number, although I do admit it may be limited in context. <em>I think it may be possible for the human eye to be sensitive to <strong>10-100 million distinct ""colors""</strong> when referring to both chromaticity and luminosity.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I'll base my answer on the work done by CIE, which began in the 1930's, and progressed again in the 1960's, with some algorithmic and accuracy improvements to formula over the last couple decades. When it comes to the arts, including photography and print, I think that the work done by the CIE is particularly relevant, as it is the basis of color correction and modern mathematical color models and color space conversion.</p>

<p>The CIE, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination"" rel=""noreferrer"">Commission internationale de l'éclairage</a>, in 1931 established the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">CIE 1931 XYZ color space</a>"". This color space was a plot of full purity color, mapped from 700nm (near-infrared red) through 380nm (near-UV), and progressed through all the wavelengths of ""visible"" light. This color space is based on human vision, which is a tri-stimulus created by the three types of cones in our eyes: short, medium and long wavelength cones, which map to 420-440nm, 530-540nm, and 560-580nm wavelengths. These wavelengths correspond to blue, green, and yellow-red (or orangish-red) primary colors. (The red cones are a bit unique, in that their sensitivity has two peaks, the primary one in the 560-580nm range, and also a second one in the 410-440nm range. This double peaked sensitivity indicates that our ""red"" cones may actually be ""magenta"" cones in terms of actual sensitivity.) The tristimulus response curves are derived from a 2° field of view of the fovea, where our cones are most concentrated and our color vision, under medium to high lighting intensity, is at its greatest.</p>

<p>The actual CIE 1931 color space is mapped from XYZ tristimulus values, which are generated from red, green, and blue derivatives, which are based on actual red, green, and blue color values (additive model.) The XYZ tristimulus values are adjusted for a ""standard illuminant"", which is normally a sunlight balanced white of 6500K (although the original CIE 1931 color space was created for three standardized illuminants A 2856K, B 4874K and C 6774K), and weighted according to a ""standard observer"" (based on that 2° foveal field of view.) The standard CIE 1931 XYZ color plot is horshoe-shaped and filled with a ""chromaticity"" diagram of pure 'colors', covering the hue range from 700nm through 380nm, and ranging in saturation from 0% centered at the white point to 100% along the periphery. This is a ""chromaticity"" plot, or color without regard to intensity (or color at maximum intensity, to be most accurate.) This color plot, according to some studies (references pending), represents about <strong>2.38 million colors</strong> that the human eye can detect under moderately high intensity lighting approximately the same color temperature and brightness of daylight (not sunlight, which is closer to 5000k, but sunlight + blue sky light, about 6500k.)</p>

<hr>

<p>So, can the human eye detect only 2.4 million colors? According to the work done by the CIE in the 1930's, under a specific illuminant that equates to the intensity and color temperature of daylight, when factoring in only the 2° of cones concentrated in the fovea of our eyes, then it seems we can indeed see 2.4 million colors. </p>

<p>The CIE specifications are limited in scope, however. They do not account for varying levels of illumination, illuminants of differing intensity or color temperature, or the fact that we have more cones spread across at least a 10° area of our retinas around the fovea. They also do not account for the fact that peripheral cones seem to be more sensitive to blues than the cones concentrated in the fovea (which are primarily red and green cones). </p>

<p>Refinements to the CIE chromaticity plots were made in the '60's and again in 1976, which refined the ""standard observer"" to include a full 10° color sensitive spot in our retinas. These refinements to CIE's standards have never come into much use, and the extensive color sensitivity research that has been done in relation to CIE's work has been largely limited to the original CIE 1931 XYZ color space and chromaticity plot.</p>

<p>Given the limitation of color sensitivity to only a 2° spot in the fovea, there is a strong likelihood that we can see more than 2.4 million colors, particularly extending into the blues and violets. This is corroborated by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1960_color_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">1960's refinements to CIE color spaces</a>. </p>

<hr>

<p>Tone, perhaps better labeled luminosity (the brightness or intensity of a color), is another aspect of our vision. Some models blend chromaticity and luminosity together, while others distinctly separate the two. The human eye contains a retina composed of both cones...""color"" sensitive devices, as well as rods, which are color-agnostic but sensitive to changes in luminosity. The human eye has about 20 times as many rods (94 million) as it does cones (4.5 million). Rods are also about 100 times as sensitive to light as cones, capable of detecting a single photon. Rods seem to be most sensitive to the blueish-green wavelengths of light (around 500nm), and have lower sensitivities to reddish and near-UV wavelengths. It should be noted that a rods sensitivity is cumulative, so the longer one observes a static scene, the clearer the levels of luminosity in that scene will be perceived by the mind. Rapid changes in a scene, or panning motion, will reduce the ability to differentiate fine tonal gradation.</p>

<p>Given the rod's far greater sensitivity to light, it seems logical to conclude that humans have a finer, and distinct, sensitivity to variations in light intensity than they do to changes in hue and saturation when one observes a static scene for a time. Exactly how this factors into our perception of color and how it affects the number of colors we can see, I can't exactly say. A simple test of tonal sensitivity can be done on a clear day's evening, just as the sun sets. The blue sky can range from near white-blue to deep dark midnight blue. While the hue of such a sky covers a very small range, the tonal grade is immense and very fine. Observing such a sky, one can see an infinitely smooth change from bright white-blue to sky blue to dark midnight blue.</p>

<hr>

<p>Studies unrelated to CIE work have indicated a wide range of ""maximum colors"" that the human eye can perceive. Some have an upper limit of 1 million colors, while others have an upper limit of 10 million colors. More recent studies have shown that some women have a unique fourth cone type, an ""orange"" cone, that could possibly extend their sensitivity to 100 million, however that study counted both chromaticity <em>and</em> luminosity in their calculation of ""color"". </p>

<p>That ultimately begs the question, can we separate chromaticity from luminosity when determining ""color""? Do we prefer to define the term ""color"" to mean the hue, saturation, <em>and</em> luminosity of the light we perceive? Or is it better to separate the two, keep chromaticity distinct from luminosity? How many levels of intensity can the eye really see, vs. how many distinct differences in chromaticity? I am not sure these questions have actually been answered in a scientific way yet. </p>

<hr>

<p>Another aspect of color perception involves contrast. It is easy to perceive a difference in two things when they contrast well with each other. When trying to visually determine how many ""colors"" one sees when looking at varying shades of red, it can be rather difficult to tell if two similar shades are different or not. However, compare a shade of red with a shade of green, and the difference is very clear. Compare that shade of green in sequence with each shade of red, and the eye can more easily pick up the differences in the red shades in peripheral relation to each other as well as in contrast with the green. These factors are all facets of the vision of our mind, which is a far more subjective device than the eye itself (which makes it hard to scientifically gauge color perception beyond the scope of the eye itself.) Given a setting with appropriate contrast, one may be able to detect far more distinct colors <em>in context</em> than a setting without any contrast at all.</p>

<p>PS: I saw this <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/7831/what-is-a-quick-way-to-restore-old-black-and-white-and-sepia-photographs"">related question</a>. Additions are welcome.</p>
","<p>A modern scanner of typical resolution should be able to do a reasonably good job on old photos if well used. Method of use can make a difference. See references at end for some tips and guidance. </p>

<p>A 6"" x 4"" print at 300 dpi corresponds to 1800 x 1200 pixels ~=.... 2.5 megapixels<br>
 A 6"" x 4"" print at 600 dpi corresponds to 3600 x 2400 pixels ~=..... 9 megapixels<br>
 A 6"" x 4"" print at 1200 dpi corresponds to 7200 x 4800 pixels ~=.. 35 megapixels<br>
 A 6"" x 4"" print at 2400 dpi corresponds to 14400 x 9600 pixels ~=. 140 megapixels  </p>

<p>File size grows in approximate proportion to megapixels for the same bits per pixel, so fil size increases with  about the square of the dpi resolution. 300 to 600 tends to be bearable. 300 to 1200 leads to 'rather large' files. </p>

<p>As will be seen in the references below (especially the first one) a good 600 dpi scanner SHOULD be able to do all you need and want when scanning photos. The implications for using a camera are discussed below. </p>

<p>If original resolution was no object (and in this case it is)<br>
300 dpi is OK to good for colour. Better would be 'nice'.<br>
 600 dpi is very good.<br>
 1200 dpi is beyond excellent in practice. </p>

<p>eg at 600 dpi a 24 megapixel print (most top full frame DSLRs and some APSCs (A77) are around that resolution) would print at about 10"" x 8"" or ~ A4.. </p>

<p>Scanner resolution differs across and along the scan as one depends on available sensor elements and the other on both sensor pitch and movement and how it is driven. Most modern scanners will happily exceed 600 dpi on both axis. Other factors are liable to make the difference.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.scantips.com/basics08.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>This excellent discussion on resolution</strong> </a> suggests scanning does not give much gains above about  - </p>

<p>The same article notes that an HP printing expert / HP printing website say:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Since printers are at or near photo quality, scanning resolution is no longer a printer-dependent value. To get photo-quality scans---even if going to a 2540 dpi image setter---200 dpi is the max resolution you need if your original is a normal silver halide color print.""</li>
</ul>

<p>The HP scanner web site says:</p>

<ul>
<li>""A Note on Resolution: The vast majority of scanning projects require resolutions lower than 300 dpi. For example, scanning a photograph at resolutions higher than 150 to 200 dpi only produces a larger file, not more detail.""</li>

<p><strong>Using a camera:</strong></p>

<p>A camera has the advantages of quick to very quick throughput compared to a scanner, and of accommodating non-flat documents well. Whether it suits in other ways is up to the user. I have achieved results which are acceptable to me for my purposes. Others may be more discerning :-). </p>

<p>As can be seen from the above discussion and various references, 300 dpi is liable to be very adequate in many cases and 600 dpi will essentially always be overkill, all else being equal. This implies that for a 6"" x 4"" print a camera of 300 megapixles will provide over 300 dpi resolution and a 10 mp camera at 600 dpi shold be very very adequate <strong>provided all other factors are properly considered.</strong> That last sentence is the area to look at.</p>

<p>About 4 years ago I needed to photograph a range of photos and old paper records - some from up to 100+ years old - but most rather newer. I had to copy these in a library situation and they could not be removed. Many documents and photos were in books or mounted in some way and in many cases scanning would have been difficult or worse or not at all suitable where there was significant 3D effect.  </p>

<p>This was for a church Jubilee. Archival results were not needed - just documents that gave a good feel for the originals and photos which were as loss-free and correct-to-the-original as was sensibly possible. I used a Minolta 7D 6 megapixel camera. The results were entirely acceptable for the purpose. </p>

<p>I was given considerable latitude and could have brought in extra lighting. Some experimenting showed that use of a camera using existing library fluorescent lighting produce photos that were adequate for the purpose.   </p>

<p>Lighting needs to be diffuse and even and produce no reflections or bright spots, the existing lighting suited  this well.   </p>

<p>Colour balance was set by inspection to produce results as close to the originals as possible.   </p>

<p>Camera was tripod mounted and focus was adjusted manually and then untouched when photographing flat photos. Readjusted as required for books.   </p>

<p>I do not now recall with certainty (somewhat to my surprise) whether I used a piece of non reflecting glass to hold photos and books etc relatively flat.  Part of my brain says that I did, and this makes sense, but another part says this is a manufactured memory. I can further check that, but it makes great sense to do so and, once sorted, reflections and similar will not be an issue. Glass will lose about 15% - 20% light level (10% per way) and can add a slight colour cast - green if regular float glass used - which is very slight and can easily be adjusted for with colour balance. </p>

<p>The photo at the very end of this post is one example of the results. This was 40+ years old at the time it was photographed. Taken at f/5.6, 1/2 s, 400 ISO - but I tried a range of apertures and other settings. Resolution was such as to appear as good <strong>or apparently better</strong> than the originals. Size here was probably around A4.<br>
 I chose this photo as an example mainly because the young man marked with the added red dot is a much younger me :-). Right click the image and copy or save for the 3008 x 2000 original. EXIF is destroyed by the stack exchange photo storer.</p>

<p>I am happy with this result. Colour is about original. Detail present is apparently equal to the original. Having dug this out I'm tempted to go back to the library and have a critical look at the original and copy 4 years on.  </p>

<p><strong>Effect of photographing a photo:</strong></p>

<p>Technically the new photo can never be ""better"" than the original and<br>
 technically the new photo will always be worse, even if only very slightly so. </p>

<p>However, if you use a good quality camera and set it up well as discussed above with proper attention to lighting, white balance, exposure, focus, aperture (affecting depth of field) etc then you can get photos which approach the original so closely that the differences are not distinguishable for practical purposes<br>
 AND in many cases, with an old photo of less than perfect original quality, you can get images which appear to the eye/brain as if they are somewhat better than the original. </p>

<p>""Improvements"" may be due to slight sharpening during capture or (about the opposite) spreading of detail across several pixels, or of the lighting and white balance combination changing the relative manner in which some visual aspects are affected. This all tends to fall into the area of subjective or personal effects and the user has to decide whether to emphasise capture effects which change the appearance or to aim as much as possible for best fidelity. For archival purposes fidelity probably wins. Where end user perception matters it may be permissible to allow some effects to occur - but these are better done post-capture where possible so that the maximum number of options are left open. </p>

<p>eg one may try HDR effects to try to capture dynamic range present in the original and outside the range of the camera - although this is not usually an issue with old prints. One could use  in-camera  HDR where available (eg Sony A77) but this then loses the images that the HDR image was created from. Taking 3 images using exposure bracketing will allow post-capture HDR and leave more options available at a later date. </p>

","<p>Let me explain how to accomplish this, then once you know that, you can do it and save the preset. First, take a subject similar to one you might use. Here is a baby image that looks good for a pastel treatment:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Udgag.jpg"" alt=""baby image""></p>

<p>Note that the contrast and tonality are pretty good and that the detail is good throughout. Now, in the Lightroom Develop Module, slide the <em>fill light</em> slider to the right. This will, all by itself provide a certain amount of pastel. I used a setting of 50-60 and what's really happening here is that the shadows are being moved into the lower third tone range and highlights are being allowed to blow out. (You may also want to lower the clarity to reduce the local contrast.)</p>

<p>Second, most people who are doing this are using some color overlay. Either a rose or yellow. You can do this using the Lightroom <em>Graduated Filter</em>. I used a very light red to provide a warm overlay effect.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QRdy0.jpg"" alt=""baby image with fill and rose overlay""></p>

<p>If you like the look, then save it as a preset and you're ready to go. Moving off the ""what you can do in Lightroom"" topic, there is ""what you can do using 3rd party filters"". Here is the same image run through Nik Viveza to bring the white background more white and the Nik Color Efex Pro to provide the vintage look (it's about 4 clicks to get the entire effect):</p>

","<p>The EF-M lenses are designed for the new mirrorless camera system, and mount much closer to the sensor than the EF-S lenses (which are designed for DSLRs with a mirror box).</p>

<p>You can use EF-S (and EF) lenses on the M system cameras using an adapter (which is just a spacer with some electrical connections to move the rear of the lens further from the sensor), but you cannot use EF-M lenses on Canon's APS-C-format DSLRs.

"Do professionals really never use a 24-70 lens?","39680","","<p>I was reading lens reviews on the Rockwell site — mostly because it came up as first result in Google search — and he was saying professionals don't need and don't use mid-range zoom lenses like <code>24-70</code> and they use a tele, an ultra-wide and then also a 50mm for night shots in dark.</p>

<p>I currently have one lens only and it is a 35mm f1.8, and my <strong><em>interest</em></strong> is city photography at day and night — streets and buildings, mostly.  But on occasion if I go to a forest or on a vacation somewhere I would like not to miss the beautiful moments and take a photo.</p>

<p>So for my needs, what kind of lenses do I even need? and do you agree with his opinion about not needing a 24-70? (I have a full frame camera, D-610 Nikon.)</p>
","<p>Rockwell presents his opinion as fact even when it is actually a contested opinion.  Yes, professionals use 24-70 lenses.  They aren't for every situation, but there are plenty where they are great go to lenses.</p>

<p>The Canon 24-70 f/2.8 II, for example, is one of the most popular zoom lenses ever.  I do wedding photography and during the reception, the 24-70 lives on my camera 85% of the time.  Nikon's f/2.8 in that segment is no slouch either if I'm remembering correctly, but double check that as I don't shoot Nikon and so my knowledge of their lens systems is not nearly as good as that of Canon.</p>

<p>What Ken (Rockwell) was likely trying to get at is the fact that prime lenses are far cheaper for the quality level and so he is advocating use of prime lenses rather than a standard zoom, since you can move with your feet relatively easily in most cases to adjust for the position when using that near of a focal length.  Telephoto zooms are a bit harder to use as primes since you'd have to walk a lot further to adjust your framing.</p>

<p>In the real world however, sometimes you don't have the time or ability to move those few feet to get the composition you need or you need to rapidly be able to change the perspective of your lens.  Event photography is a perfect example of this.  In those cases, a professional photographer can and should use the lens that best lets them cover the situation and a fast standard zoom lens fills that niche superbly.</p>

<p>For your situation of shooting mostly buildings where you can set the shot up, you are probably best served by following his advice though.  Your subjects don't move and you need maximum low light capability.  The extra stop or two of aperture in addition to the cost savings and/or sharpness advantage of prime lenses will give you the most bang for your buck in shooting static objects since repositioning and swapping lenses isn't an issue.</p>

<p>You'd do fine with a fast zoom, but you'll be paying more than you need to for capabilities you will use less frequently.</p>

"What's the difference between Canon's silent and non-silent shooting?","39537","","<p>I'm using a Canon 5D MkIII and I've been exceptionally pleased with the results of the 'new' single/continuous silent shooting functionality. </p>

<p>I'd like to know what the difference between silent and non-silent shooting is. Does it affect image quality at all? As far as I can tell, the only difference is to do with the speed that I can shoot at. Is there anything else?</p>

<p>I'm also interested to know what the difference between Silent LV (Live View?) shooting Mode 1, Mode 2, and Disabled is.</p>
","<p>Silent shooting mode normally (*please see the end of the answer for a notable exception) does not affect <em>Image Quality</em> in any way. Rather, it affects the way your 5D mk III cycles the mirror and shutter curtain for each shot you take.</p>

<p>When shooting via the viewfinder:</p>

<p>The <em>Silent mode single</em> option uses a slower speed to move the mirror up out of the light box. The first curtain opens, and then the second curtain closes as normal. The mirror then drops back down and the shutter curtain reset, again at a slower speed than normal. [With some other Canon models after the second curtain closes nothing else will happen until you release the full press of the shutter button. When you do, the mirror will drop back down, again at a reduced rate, and the shutter curtains will reset. This is very useful when shooting tennis or golf. You can expose a frame virtually silently at the height of a competitor's back swing and hold the shutter down until they have struck the ball and then release the button and allow the mechanisms to reset.]</p>

<p>The <em>silent mode continuous</em> option is similar, but allows multi-shot bursts. The mirror swings up more slowly. After each exposure the mirror and shutter mechanisms will reset at a slower and quieter rate. This reduces maximum frame rate from 6 fps to 3 fps.</p>

<p>In <em>Live View</em>:</p>

<p>The options are similar, but the mirror stays up as long as you are in <em>Live View</em> and are using <em>Contrast Detection Autofocus</em> or <em>Manual Focus</em>:</p>

<p><em>Mode 1</em> begins with the first curtain open prior to the shot (so that the sensor is exposed to give a Live View image on the camera's LCD screen). When the shutter button is pressed the sensor is cleared and then electronically exposed from bottom to top (top to bottom of the inverted image) to begin capturing the image. The exposure is ended by the movement of the first curtain from the bottom of the light box back to the top of the light box. This is the same direction the first curtain is moved when it is reset following a still shot taken using the viewfinder. The second curtain never moves throughout the entire <em>Live View - Silent Shooting</em> cycle with mode 1. For each frame exposed, the only sound is the first curtain closing to end the exposure and then reopening for the next shot (if the shutter button is held down for a continuous burst) or to allow the sensor to send an image to the LCD screen for Live View (if the shutter button is released).</p>

<p><em>Mode 2</em> is a single shot mode. The shot begins just like <em>Mode 1</em>. But the second curtain closes from the top to the bottom of the light box (bottom to top of the inverted image) to end the exposure. Once the second curtain closes it doesn't reopen to expose the sensor for <em>Live View</em> until the full press of the shutter button is released. The first curtain never moves throughout the entire <em>Live View - Silent Shooting</em> cycle with mode 2. For each frame exposed, the only sound is the second curtain closing to end the exposure. Once the full press of the shutter button is ended the sound of the second curtain reopening to allow the sensor to send an image to the LCD screen for Live View will be heard.</p>

<p><em>Disable</em> allows shooting with Canon's Tilt-Shift lenses or when using extension tubes (and presumably any third party lens that has an aperture manually set on the lens). When the shutter button is fully pressed using this setting the first curtain resets to the top of the light box, the sensor is cleared, and the first curtain reopens to begin the exposure. The exposure is ended by the conventional movement of the second curtain from the top to bottom of the light box, the sensor is read out, and the second curtain is reset to the top of the light box while the first curtain remains open in the bottom of the light box.</p>

<p>(*The exception would be when you are using shutter speeds subject to allowing the vibrations produced by the mirror and to a lesser extent the shutter curtains to affect the image. Although it varies based on camera design, most researches that have thoroughly tested such vibrations place shutter speeds between about 1/100 second and 1 second as the most vulnerable to mirror vibration affecting the image. Any shorter exposure time and the image has already been recorded by the time the vibrations reach the parts of the camera that affect the image. Any longer and the vibrations don't last long enough to have much effect in the same way that someone running rapidly across the field of view of a 30 second exposure won't show up in the image. Do note that you'll only ever be able to detect blur caused by mirror vibrations if the camera is mounted on solid footing such as a sturdy tripod, the shutter is released using a wired remote cable, an IR remote, or the self-timer and the subject is also perfectly static.)</p>

"How can I preserve/protect existing framed prints from fading?","39522","","<p>I have some prints that were printed and framed professionally, and now they are situated in a relatively bright room, and I am concerned that they will fade in the light.</p>

<p>I have heard that there exists UV protection in the form of 'spray on glass', but searches online seem to only come up with research products that have not made it to market yet.</p>

<p>Ideally I am looking for something that I can apply to the frame that is invisible rather than on the prints themselves — some kind of plastic coating or spray-on thing.</p>
","<p>The best and most common form of protection from fading would be the selection of <strong>UV glass or acrylic</strong>. Any framing store will have these options available at multiple price points with trade offs such as glare or less glare, scratch resistant or scratch prone, and tint(green) or no tint.</p>

<p>Specifically you are asking for a form of UV protection that is <strong>spray on</strong>, and this type of protection does exist, I would try <strong><a href=""http://www.krylon.com/products/uvresistant_clear/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Krylon UV Resistant Clear Coating Spray</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This product is made for use on artwork that is either outside or near windows. They offer the product in gloss and matte finish as well. Krylon is a very well respected brand, and I believe this will be the easiest and cheapest solution to the problem, albeit not necessarily the best.</p>

<p>Another spray on option would be <strong><a href=""http://www.premierimagingproducts.com/pc_printshield.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Premier Imaging Products Print Shield</a></strong>. It is a lacquer based protective spray that is designed for inkjet prints. It also works on photo papers and canvas materials. They specify up to a 2x lightfastness increase, elimination of gloss differential, non yellowing formula, and a reduction in scuffing.
The results have been tested by an independent lab (Wilhelm Research) to last up to 166 years with certain Epson papers and regular glass, and over 200 years with UV filtering glass.</p>

<p>As with any products like this I would suggest testing them out on a test print before you go and use them on your framed and mounted originals.</p>

<p>Above I have given you a few different options, to sum them up I will list the <strong>following options</strong>-</p>

<ul>
<li>UV Filtering Glass</li>
<li>UV Filtering Acrylic</li>
<li>Krylon UV Resistant Clear Coating Spray</li>
<li>Premier Imaging Products Print Shield</li>
<li>Picture Shields inserts (not described here, but link <a href=""http://www.ephotozine.com/article/using-uv-protection-to-look-after-your-framed-photos-8724"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>To get down to the root of your issue, it sounds like you want to try to <strong>add UV protection without disassembling your professional framed and matted prints</strong>. Many professionally framed prints will be finished in the back, such that you have to open them up to do any type of glass exchange or sprays. I would not attempt to spray the exterior glass without first removing the glass. It just does not sound like a good idea to me, and you will probably end up with lines from the tape, or worse - over spray on the frame.</p>

<p>Furthermore, application of a spray type UV protection can be quite difficult to do in a uniform and smooth fashion. You may consider having the images professionally reproduced(scanned) prior to the application in case you are not satisfied after some time. You also might just be better off with the addition of UV filtering glass, keeping the image unaltered.</p>

<p>Beyond the scope of just using UV filtering vehicles, you will want to understand <strong>how prints get UV light</strong>, and other ways that prints are damaged over time.</p>

<p>UV light rays occur not only in natural light from the sun, but also in smaller quantities from indoor lighting sources. Florescent lighting is especially prone to outputting harmful UV rays, so if possible limit this type of lighting near the photos you are displaying. You will want to keep frames away from heat sources like fireplaces or central heating vents, because this type of added heat can cause premature aging of the photos as well.</p>

<p>It is important to note that UV protection will not eliminate fading, it will only limit the amount of harmful UV rays that will contact the photo. Other factors can contribute to fading, such as pollution, humidity, heat, and the paper that was chosen for the print and surrounding matting.</p>

<p>Another benefit to choosing UV filtering glass is that many reflections are often removed by this process, providing a better viewing experience.</p>

<p>Overall, I think you have quite a few options at your disposal. Realistically, in today's digital world, if you created the images, hold on to your RAW and/or high quality JPEG files and you can reprint if needed. If you didn't create the images or you do not have the originals, you have many options that are tested and work very well. Light is the print's enemy, so you could consider moving the prints to a darker room, getting better blinds or drapes, or even rotating them out seasonally to the closet.</p>

<p>For very detailed information you might find the ISO specification <a href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=30862"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 18902</a> useful.</p>

"What is tone mapping? How does it relate to HDR?","39423","","<p>Whenever I read / hear about HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, someone usually says something along the lines of ""Actually, you're talking about tone mapping, not HDR.""  </p>

<p>Please can someone explain what Tone Mapping is, and how it relates to HDR?  </p>
","<p>An HDR image has a high dynamic range, which means a very large ratio between the brightest and darkest parts of the image. An HDR image on a normal (low dynamic range) monitor will actually look very flat:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/hdr.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/hdr.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is because that huge range of brightnesses has to be compressed to fit into a much smaller range of brightnesses. This results in an overall lack of contrast, hence the flatness. </p>

<p>This image has a split personality, the skies are very bright and the subject much dimmer, if we could use all the monitor's brightness range for the sky, it would look pretty good:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/top.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/top.jpg</a></p>

<p>But we'd totally lose our subject. Likewise if you used all the monitors brightness range for the subject it would also look good, but we'd totally lose the sky:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/bottom.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/bottom.jpg</a></p>

<p>It would be great if we could combine them in some way, or carefully ration out the brightness range we have to work with so we make most use of it. This is where tonemapping comes in.</p>

<p>What tonemapping does is instead of mapping the whole image into the monitor's brightness range in one go, it adjusts the contrast locally so that each region of the image uses the whole range for maximum contrast (there's a bit more going on here, it depends on the tonemapping algorithm used). Here is the same image tonemapped:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/tonemapped.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/tonemapped.jpg</a></p>

<p>The reason that tonemapping is not HDR is that you can tonemap a single low dynamic range image in order to make it more contrasty. The result looks similar but with much more noise in the shadows:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/tonemapped_from_single_image.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/tonemapped_from_single_image.jpg</a></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: for the love of God don't do this to your images!</em></p>

<p>This is a demonstration of the fact that dynamic range and noise are opposites, in fact dynamic range is usually defined in terms of the noise floor of an image. This is because there is a point at which any tonal differences in an image get lost in noise, so this defines the darkest thing you can image (which in turn with the brightest thing, defined by the point at which the signal clips) determines the dynamic range.</p>

<p>Distance is always key. If you are working indoors, even with a specialist photographic black backdrop it's really hard to get it jet black in your photos. ""black"" objects still reflect some light so if lighting from the front if any of your key light hits the background the effect is easily scuppered.</p>

<p>This is where the inverse square law comes in, if the light is twice the distance from your background as it is from the subject, the background gets 4 x less light. Three times further away and it's 9 x less. This allows you to make a white wall turn black if it's far enough away.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/elephant_white_bg.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/elephant_white_bg.jpg</a></p>

<p>The above image was shot in front of a white projector screen! That's about as bright white as objects get. But due to the lighting being many times <em>closer</em> to the grey subject, the background appears absolutely jet black.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/grey_bg.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/grey_bg.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now the flash in the elephant example was extremely close, however the effect scales up to people, the above image was shot in front of a white wall, which although it doesn't go pure black it's suitable for most purposes (this was actually part of a multi light setup with the background light off, I could have move further from the wall).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/elephant_black_bg.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/elephant_black_bg.jpg</a></p>

<p>This image demonstrates the opposite effect - the background was substituted for a piece of black card, of similar reflectance to many commercial photographic backgrounds. Now enough light is hitting this ""black"" object for it to appear white!</p>

<p>Here's an example of what goes wrong if you don't have enough space, even with the right gear:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/not_quite_black_background.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/not_quite_black_background.jpg</a></p>

<p>There wasn't sufficient space (or a large enough background) to have the background further from the subject, and the result is a not quite black background which shows up creases and other imperfections which need to be 'shopped out. Not ideal.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now your actual question referred to creating a uniform background (not necessarily 100% pure black). Any black material could be used, but unless you get it jet black, the weave plus any creases are going to show up. This can be remedied by throwing the background out of focus with a fast lens. Unfortunately this also requires space (or a very big aperture) so ultimately I'm afraid there are few options for the space limited!</p>

" How do I change the exposure setting in manual mode on a Canon EOS 550D?","39117","","<p>I have recently bought a Canon EOS 550D. In the Manual Mode, I am unable to change the exposure level. What am I missing here? I am sure there must be a way to change it.</p>
","<p><strong>Based on experience, I am certain you are confusing <em>exposure</em> and <em>exposure-compensation</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Exposure is a product of 3 parameters: ISO, shutter-speed, aperture. <strong>In Manual mode, you control all of these</strong> and doing so sets the exposure. @jrista shows very clearly how to control each of them. For how they relate, see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6598/what-is-the-exposure-triangle"">What is the exposure triangle?</a>.</p>

<p>Exposure-compensation (EC), marked on most cameras including yours by a ± sign, <strong>is an offset from the exposure the camera is computing</strong> in automatic (P, Auto) and semi automatic mode (S, A). In all these modes, the camera computes an exposure (based on the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/4687/when-best-to-use-multi-zone-matrix-spot-or-center-weight"">metering mode</a>) and EC is how you tell the camera to adjust the computed value by a certain amount.</p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>In all modes except manual</strong>: The camera computes an exposure and you use EC to tell it to make things brighter or darker relative to its guess.</li>
<li><strong>In manual mode</strong>: You set the exposure exactly using Aperture, Shutter-Speed and ISO. There is no offset the camera can apply because all the parameters have been fixed by you.</li>

"How do I keep both the background and foreground in the image in focus at the same time?","38953","","<p>How do you have both the background and foreground in the image in focus at the same time?</p>

<p>Last week I was attempting a shot where I had the back of a hat in focus and in the distance you could see a mountain. I wanted both in focus, but could either focus on the mountain or the hat.

From what I have read aperture is important in the depth of field but what are the techniques for keeping both the background and foreground in focus?</p>

<p>I am using a Nikon D5100 with a 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 (standard kit lens) and a 55-200mm 
f/4.5-5.6. </p>

<p><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/14390/can-you-shoot-with-a-55mm-lens-so-that-you-have-both-person-and-background-clear"">This question</a> almost answers my question, but I am a bit confused. Can someone explain this a bit differently? Thanks!</p>
","<p>I think this is mostly answered, but I'll add some examples.</p>

<p>When a lens is focused at a particular distance, the image will appear sharp from some distance in front of the focus point to some distance behind it. The range from ""nearest sharp point"" to ""most distant sharp point"" is called depth of field (DOF).</p>

<p>Here's a Wikipedia example. The focus point is the ""depth of field"" text, and the DOF extends approximately from the line below to the line above:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q7kM2.jpg"" alt=""DOF example""></p>

<p>DOF depends on three factors. <em>(That is, three factors you can easily change. DOF also depends on the size of the camera sensor, how large you want to print or display the picture, how closely you look and how critical you are, but I'll assume that these are constant.)</em></p>

<p>The factors you can easily change are</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Aperture</strong>: Smaller aperture gives more DOF. <br>
<em>Example: (All examples for Nikon D5100 or other APS-C 1.5x crop camera.) <br>
55mm <strong>f/5.6</strong>, focus at 10 feet: DOF range from 9 to 11 feet (2 feet total)<br>
55mm <strong>f/22</strong>, focus at 10 feet:  DOF range from 7 to 18 feet  (11 feet total)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distance</strong>: More distance from camera to focus point gives more DOF.<br>
<em>Example: <br>
55mm f/5.6, <strong>focus at 10 feet</strong>: DOF range 9 - 11 feet (2 feet total)<br>
55mm f/5.6, <strong>focus at 20 feet</strong>: DOF range 16 - 26 feet (10 feet total)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focal length</strong>: Shorter focal length gives more DOF.<br>
<em>Example:<br>
<strong>55mm</strong> f/5.6, focus at 10 feet: DOF range 9 - 11 feet<br>
<strong>18mm</strong> f/5.6, focus at 10 feet: DOF range 5 feet to infinity</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>So to maximize the depth of field, the basics are</p>

<ul>
<li>Shortest possible focal length</li>
<li>Smallest possible aperture (although at very small apertures you run into diffraction blur instead)</li>
<li>If possible, increase distance between camera and foreground</li>
<li>Focus slightly behind the foreground subject, to exploit the fact that DOF extends some distance in front of the focus point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples: </p>

<ul>
<li>18mm f/22, focus at 2 feet: DOF range from 1 to 12 feet</li>
<li>18mm f/22, focus at 10 feet: DOF range from 2 feet to infinity</li>
<li>18mm f/22, focus at infinity (the mountains): DOF range from ~2.5 feet to infinity.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you could have everything from 2 feet to infinity in focus, by focusing at 10 feet.</p>

<p>If you want to go advanced, you could improve DOF slightly by focusing at what's called the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/65/what-is-hyperfocal-distance"">hyperfocal distance</a>. (Although you would need a table or calculator to look it up.) </p>

<p>Focusing at the hyperfocal distance gives the maximum possible depth of field, in this case that's</p>

<ul>
<li>18mm f/32, focus at 1.7 feet (hyperfocal distance): DOF range from 0.9 feet to infinity</li>
</ul>

<p>That's the best optics can give you. If you need more than that, you'll have to fake it by taking multiple shots and merging them.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can find these values from an online DOF calculator like the one <a href=""http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ElendilTheTall linked to</a>.
Just select your camera (or another camera with the same size sensor, like D5000 in your case) and fill in focal length, f-stop and focus distance.</p>

<p><em>Note that these DOF values are only approximate: The DOF range is calculated using a definition of ""acceptable sharpness"" - subjects at the edges of the DOF range will be slightly out of focus, but we might still call them ""acceptably sharp"" - and what <strong>you</strong> consider acceptable will probably differ from the standard definition. 
<br>You will have to experiment to find your own limits, but a DOF calculator is a good starting point.</em></p>

And the FileHub is also a WiFi hub and a portable battery, which comes in very handy. It's a bit fiddlier - two small devices and a mobile app, instead of a single slightly larger device with an integrated UI - but it's dead cheap and seems much more future-proof than the Nexto DI.</p>

"Which prime lens for Pentax APS-C?","38704","","<p>My girlfriend is buying a <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentaxk5/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pentax K-5</a> (I already have a Pentax DSLR so we thought it made sense for us to be able to share lenses), and she's not sure about which lens to get with it, so I've been charged with offering her my advice/research.</p>

<p>We left it last night that I'd ask here for advice on which superzoom to get (e.g. 18-200mm Sigma) as they would be very convenient, but, as usually happens when I start reading and researching, my targeted level of quality took a significant bump and I'm now thinking that if she's spending that kind of money on a prosumer body she may as well stick to the kinds of lenses that will help her get the best she can out of her camera. She's often examining the sharpness of her photos and is a bit of a perfectionist, so I think she'll enjoy her photography more overall if she knows she's not being held back by her lens, even though she'd have to swap over to my SMC Pentax-FA 80-320mm f4.5-5.6 when she wants telephoto.</p>

<p>Photography is a hobby of hers (neither of us are pros or anything like that). Normal usage will be landscapes, nature, friends/family shots, holidays. </p>

<p>As this prime would function as her general walkabout lens, I'm looking at focal lengths of around 35mm. One which has caught my eye is the <a href=""http://www.pentaxforums.com/lensreviews/SMC-Pentax-DA-40mm-F2.8-Limited-Pancake-Lens.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SMC Pentax-DA 40mm F2.8 Limited</a>.</p>

<p>From what I've read, the quality is good and having a pancake lens would be relatively portable and <em>pretty</em> damn cool. :)</p>

<p>Possible points for considering others:</p>

<ul>
<li>She sometimes likes to get in close with flowers, etc., and it's not a macro lens.</li>
<li>I gather f2.8 is decent but that larger apertures on primes are relatively available.</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't have to be Pentax as long as it fits her K-5. (She's German so I'm sure she'd be up for a Carl Zeiss, but I expect they're way more expensive.)</p>

<p>Her budget seems to be around €450ish for the lens, but I think she's open to moving slightly either way depending on value.</p>

<p>With that in mind, do you have any advice, recommendations of specific lenses or general guidance?</p>
","<p>There's so many nice Pentax primes — why pick just one when you can collect a whole set? That's why we have Lens Buying Addiction, after all!</p>

<p>In seriousness, based on what you've said, I think the <strong>smc PENTAX DA 35mm F2.8 Macro Limited</strong> may be the place you should start. But, I've used quite a few Pentax primes, so let me give you the whole tour, as it were.</p>

<h2>Series</h2>

<p>Pentax makes two major series of prime lenses, and a number of prime lenses outside of those lineups as well.</p>

<p><strong>FA Limited</strong> is the premiere prime lineup from the last days of Pentax as a film camera company. They're relatively modern designs (dating to the late 90s and early 00s), but definitely made for film. Manual focus on these lenses is a pleasure, and in exchange autofocus is a bit slow. In general, they have gorgeous rendition, and are relatively fast and small. Presumably the lens coatings are not designed for digital sensors, but I really haven't seen anyone complaining. The lenses have full-frame coverage, and there's persistent rumors that Pentax is going to cancel them any day now — but they haven't yet. (For a while, they weren't even shown, but they're back on the <a href=""http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/files/pdf/lens_roadmap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pentax lens roadmap</a> now.)</p>

<p><strong>DA Limited</strong> is the designed-for-digital premiere prime series. The design focus is somewhat different: small, jewel-like ""pancake"" designs are favored, and even the models which aren't technically pancakes are quite compact. This is at the expense of a few stops in max aperture, the thinking apparently being that the amazing high-ISO capabilities of modern sensors make this less important. They do generally have nice bokeh, although maybe  a little busier than that of the FA series. And a key point is that they're quite good wide open — you can get peak performance by stopping down a bit, but you don't need to. Autofocus is very fast (another advantage of keeping the weight of down), and while they feature solid metal construction, the focus rings have less throw, which, combined with the slower optics, makes manual focus not as enjoyable as with the FA series. Overall, the optical qualities are excellent, and while the FA lenses have legendary status, the DA lineup is by no means a step down.</p>

<p>In 2013, Pentax announced a refresh of the five lenses in the DA Limited series, adding curved aperture blades and the improved ""HD"" optical coating. These versions have a red ring instead of the green ring found on the earlier models. The previous SMC coating was well-regarded, but theoretically these should have higher transmittance and even better control of flare and ghosting, and of course more attractive bokeh when stopped down. It's a pity they didn't add weather resistance, but that probably would have meant a significant redesign of the lens body.</p>

<p><strong>DA ★</strong> (or <em>DA Star</em>) is Pentax's ""high grade"" designation. Lenses in this series are weather- and dust-sealed, and feature ultrasonic focus motors built into the lens. There's a few long telephoto lenses with this designation, and one portrait prime.</p>

<p>Then, there are a few other lenses in production within the <strong>DA</strong>, <strong>FA</strong>, and <strong>D FA</strong> series. In general, the ones with a <em>D</em> are designed with digital in mind, and the <em>FA</em> means full-frame coverage. Up until recently, it was sure that the D FA models had a manual aperture ring, but Pentax doesn't seem to hold that sacred.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of out-of-production lenses that are worth looking into, from the FA series and older. But in the interest of this-is-a-long-enough-post-already, I'll going to concentrate on only current models.</p>

<p>So, on to specifics:</p>

<h2>Ultra-Wide</h2>

<p><strong>smc DA 14mm F2.8</strong> This is one of the older DA designs. I've only used it briefly in a store; my main impression was that it's relatively large and heavy. It's, basically, what you might expect from a fast ultrawide prime. I haven't really heard anyone raving about this lens one way or another.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA 15mm F4 ED AL Limited</strong> / <strong>HD DA 15mm F4 ED AL Limited</strong> I just got this, and, apart from <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/12691/what-makes-a-strong-wide-angle-composition"">struggling with wide-angle composition in general</a> I really enjoy it. It's inevitably heavier and a bit bigger than the other DA Limited lenses, but still feels compact. The old-school distance scale on the lens is a nice touch, and the built-in lens hood is great. I don't really miss faster apertures at this focal length; generally I want <em>more</em> in focus, not less, and I tend to use it where there's plenty of light. Perspective distortion is inherent with ultra-wide, but barrel distortion is impressively controlled, and there's no other strange distortions or any optical problems to speak of. And for a wide-angle lens, it does an amazing job of handling flare — you can point this thing right at the sun and get nice results. Recommended, but probably not as your first starting point.</p>

<h2>Wide</h2>

<p><strong>smc DA 21mm F3.2 AL Limited</strong> / <strong>HD DA 21mm F3.2 AL Limited</strong>My friend from whom I could borrow this moved to the other coast a couple of years ago, so I'm going from memory. My main impression was: yeah, that's fine. It's not dramatic enough to really feel <em>wide</em>, but it takes in enough of the scene that it doesn't feel intimate. However, the field of view on a 1.5× crop-factor dSLR like the K-5 is roughly equivalent to the traditional 35mm, which I know some photographers really like. So if that's your thing, this may be a good choice for you. (Having used the iPhone camera extensively, I think I have a little more appreciation for the versatility of a moderate wide angle lens like this than I did; I should give it another try.) As with the 15mm, I don't think the speed is generally a concern, not with good high ISO from the camera.</p>

<h2>Normal</h2>

<p><strong>smc FA 31mm F1.8 Limited</strong> I have not used this lens, but it is certainly legendary among Pentax photographers. Since I haven't direct experience, I won't go on, but people do love it. This is the third-most expensive lens Pentax has on the market, which, at less than a $1000, is really another way of saying that Pentax's great lenses are really quite affordable, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/9355/how-much-do-lens-lineups-vary-across-platforms/9365#9365"">comparatively speaking</a>.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA 35mm F2.4 AL</strong> This is Pentax's new affordable normal prime, their answer to Nikon's AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G. It's a decent lens, and rumor has it that it's basically an update of the generally-respected smc FA 35mm F2 AL, which was recently discontinued. Plastic construction, but solid.  There's a few other cost-cutting measures — for example, no ""quick shift"" to disengage the focus system when AF isn't active, which I think is a nice feature to have. Image quality doesn't stand out particularly, either positively or negatively. I think it's a decent value at the price, but I also think it's probably not what you're looking for. (It's a better match for the K-r than the K-5.)</p>

<p><strong>smc DA 35mm F2.8 Macro Limited</strong> / 
<strong>HD DA 35mm F2.8 Macro Limited</strong> The main reason I don't have this is because I have and love the 40mm Limited, and I decided that they're too close to justify it. I came close, though! I've seen some technical reviews which conclude that the numbers aren't as good as those for the other Limited lenses, but the actual results I've seen are stellar. Lens connoisseur Mike Johnston puts it through <a href=""http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/04/the-smc-pentax.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some hands-on testing</a> and ends up calling it ""<a href=""http://photo.net/columns/mjohnston/pentax-35mm-lens/optical-discussion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an optical paragon</a>"", which is really better than taking my word for it. Compared to the DA 40mm, the slightly wider field of view makes it closer to a true normal lens on the Pentax DSLRs (although even wider would be ideal — around 29mm). One downside is that since it's designed for macro focusing, the AF is somewhat slower than on the DA 40mm. The K-7 or K-5 can still focus it quite quickly, though.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA 40mm F2.8 Limited</strong> /
<strong>HD DA 40mm F2.8 Limited</strong> This is my most-used lens. (I posted a bunch of <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/14/2011/6/9"">sample family snapshots in the photo chat a few weeks ago</a>, and there's <a href=""http://www.pentaxphotogallery.com/home#/section=ARTIST&amp;subSection=1270307&amp;subSubSection=11319126&amp;language=EN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one in the official Pentax Photo Gallery</a>, which I'm kind of proud of because that site is very unfriendly to posting pictures of your kids.) From a technical standpoint, it produces gorgeous results basically effortlessly. And I'm pretty sure it's the fastest autofocusing of any Pentax lens. The focal length is a bit odd on a 1.5×-crop camera, but it basically works out like a normal lens with a built-in crop that makes you make tighter compositions without thinking about it. It also has a close-focusing distance of about 13"", which is not macro by any means but lets you get comfortably close to things if need be. Anyway, this stays on my camera 80% of the time. One tip: stow away the screw on lens cap and replace it with a clip-on one. The metal lens cap is classy, but too fiddly for field work. (If you have a Pentax Auto110 by any chance, the cap from the 35mm lens fits perfectly, and still says Pentax. Heh.)</p>

<p><strong>smc FA 43mm F1.9 Limited</strong> A friend of mine got this at the same time I got the DA 40mm, so I've been able to compare pretty well. Stopped down, the results are pretty similar; of course, the FA 43mm is slightly more than a stop faster, and the bokeh definitely is nice. At f/2.8, the DA 40mm lens is sharper across the frame, while the FA 43mm is distinctly sharper in the center. The FA is much slower to autofocus, to the point where I'd sometimes miss things I know I wouldn't have with the DA 40mm.</p>

<h2>Portrait Telephoto</h2>

<p><strong>smc FA 50mm F1.4</strong> This is the classic film-era nifty-fifty from Pentax. The FA design comes directly from the earlier models with F, A, and even M designations, and probably even before that. It <a href=""http://www.popphoto.com/how-to/2009/03/battle-50s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stacks up just fine against similar lenses from other brands</a>, and again, <a href=""http://theonlinephotographer.blogspot.com/2007/02/great-50mm-lenses.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mike Johnston likes it</a>. However, it's a bit, I dunno, <em>pedestrian</em> compared to many other Pentax primes. At the current pricing, I really don't see why one would go for it over one of the Limiteds, unless f/1.4 was really, really important to you.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA 50mm F1.8</strong> Pentax's newest lens, but from the optical specifications, probably a refresh of the classic 50mm f/1.7 — which is no bad thing, because that's a wonderful lens (also on Mike Johnston's top 10). I have the old version, and it's my favorite lens on my K1000 film camera. The new version adds modern conveniences like autofocus, newer optical coatings, and features rounded aperture blades for smooth bokeh — just like the much more expensive DA ★ 55mm below. Like the 35mm f/2.4, this is positioned as a budget prime, but as with that lens, the skimping seems to be on things like plastic lens mount rather then metal — not on image quality.</p>

<p><strong>smc D FA 50mm F2.8 Macro</strong> Another older design, with solid but plasticky construction. It does have the quick-shift mechanism like the DA lenses, so you can manually focus even with AF engaged. Like most macro primes, it features excellent optical quality, but sometimes people complain about the octagonal highlights when stopped down. Also, on APS-C, this becomes a kind of weird length for macro. The wider 35mm works better as a general-purpose lens (or for document reproduction), and one of the other choices is probably better for portraits.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA ★ 55mm F1.4 SDM</strong> As far as I can tell, people fall into two camps on this lens: people who have read technical reviews and hate it in theory, and people who have used it for portraits and love it in reality. This is a special-purpose lens with a modern design specially made for portraits. It's got Pentax's quiet but slow USM focusing system, a non-rotating front element, and all the high-end touches one would expect of a ★-class lens (including dust/weather sealing). The aperture blades are rounded for smooth bokeh, which is nice because while it's designed to be used wide open that gives flexibility to stop down a bit as well. And, it's one of only a very few Pentax lenses to use a nanocoating, which they call <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/24849/1943"">Aero Bright</a>.  It's also heavy and and quite a lot more expensive than the FA 50mm F1.4. If you're really serious about making photographs of people and don't give a second thought to the weight, definitely consider this.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA 70mm F2.4 Limited</strong> / <strong>HD DA 70mm F2.4 Limited</strong> I have this lens and use it often. It pretty much never goes wrong. It's not as tiny as the DA 40mm, but is still incredibly small and light. Despite the diminutive size, there are basically no technical flaws or problems which impact image quality. Like the DA 15mm, it's got a handy built-in pull-out lens hood. The focal length is just right for close-in portraits, but I've also used it for kids' soccer games. Because of the small size and weight, this is one of the fastest focusing options.</p>

<p><strong>smc FA 77mm F1.8 Limited</strong> As with the DA 40mm / FA 43mm Limited, I've had some time to compare against a friend's copy. The FA 77mm is a little bit faster in terms of aperture, and it's reasonable to argue that the bokeh has a more dreamy quality. The 70mm is a bit sharper across the frame, although for the kind of work one would usually put it to, I don't think that's a serious complaint against the 77mm. Also, as with the 40mm and 43mm, the newer DA lens is decidedly snappier to autofocus. The FA lens is quite a bit more expensive, and overall the results are quite similar — I don't think most people could tell the resulting images apart in a double-blind study.</p>

<h2>Long Telephoto</h2>

<p><strong>smc D FA 100mm F2.8 Macro</strong> See the next entry.</p>

<p><strong>smc D FA 100mm F2.8 WR Macro</strong> I have to insert the caveat that while I've at least handled most of the lenses above (and used a number of them quite extensively), I've never even touched the 100mm macros. So, I'm going to restrict myself to more general comments. These are basically the same lens; the WR version is newer and features a Limited-style metal body <em>with</em> weather sealing. Optically, they're the same, and quite well regarded. There's some hope that the WR designation will find its way to a newer version of the 35mm Macro as well, since a weather-sealed normal is conspicuously missing from this list.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA ★ 200mm F2.8 ED (IF) SDM</strong>  I was able to use one of these for a couple of weeks as part of the Stack Exchange <a href=""https://photo.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2135/call-for-photography-gear-grant-applicants-april-2012"">Gear Grant Program</a>. This is a great lens with beautiful rendering. Construction is top-notch, and like all ★ lenses, it's weather-sealed, so it could be part of a nice wildlife kit. However, wow, it is large. It is literally larger and heavier than all my DA Limited lenses put together. Personally, I'm not sure I'd go Pentax in the first place if this sort of lens was my attraction, as the big two camera brands provide even <em>more</em> options in this range — and up. But if you're invested in Pentax for other reasons <em>and</em> this is something you need, it's good that there's the option.</p>

<p><strong>smc DA ★ 300mm F4 ED(IF) SDM</strong> Basically a twin to the 200mm DA ★, announced at the same time and with similar construction. The 300mm has the distinction of being the second most expensive current Pentax lens, bested only by the smc DA ★ 60-250mm F4 ED (IF) SDM weather-sealed zoom. I haven't used this one but by all reports if this is the <em>kind</em> of lens you're looking for you won't be disappointed.</p>

"What am I losing when using extension tubes instead of a macro lens?","38278","","<p>After playing around with macro photography on-the-cheap (read: reversed lens, rev. lens mounted on a straight lens, passive extension tubes), I would like to get further with this. The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot <em>live</em> insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.</p>

<p>So, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.</p>

<p>Except for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?</p>
","<p>as others have noted you lose light but with extension tubes you gain versatility that is sometimes not available with a EF 100.</p>

<p>I have a EF70-200/2.8 that I use with extension tubes (kenko 12mm, 20mm, 36mm) especially for taking photos of insects. 
the Minimum Working Distance from the front of the lens to the subject with the lens zoomed to 200mm:</p>

<pre><code>58cm with 12mm extension tube
72cm with 20mm extension tube
86cm with 36mm extension tube
</code></pre>

<p>setting the lens to the 70mm position brings your MWD numbers down to the 30cm range</p>

<p>I have the EF 100 macro that I prefer using whenever its expedient but very often the bugs get nervous and skitter away when I get close enough to fill the frame with them. So I use the 70-200 with extension tubes so I can position the lens a couple feet from them and still get very sharp pictures of the bug.</p>

<p>I prefer to not use a flash to take pictures of bugs for a number of reasons consequently another problem with the EF 100 is that when I come in close I often end up blocking the light source or casting a shadow over the subject that changes the dynamic of the picture. By using the extension tubes and the EF 70-200 I can take advantage of a natural light source. </p>

<p>When I do use a flash I use a Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite (I tried a lot of other options and finally bit the bullet) mounted on the EF 100.</p>

<p>as a side note, while purists will sniff disdain, I do stage shots with live bugs - usually what I do is capture several of them the day before and store then in Tupperware in the refrigerator overnight then bring them to the scene I want for a backdrop in a cooler. The cold doesn't kill them but it does slow them down quite a bit so you can stage the shot. Also butterflys are suckers for hummingbird feeder juice made with vodka - they drink some of it then they perch somewhere nearby and move their wings very slowly and don't seem to mind if you get real close to them. Of course if they drink too much and fall over on their side its not a pretty picture.</p>

"What does ""expanded ISO"" mean?","38073","","<p>The ISO specification for <a href=""http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/EOS_7D/"">the Canon EOS 7D</a> reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High ISO</strong> 
  For handheld shooting in low light, the EOS 7D offers ISO
  speeds of up to 6400. Expandable to
  ISO 12800, for low light scenes where
  using flash is undesirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it phrased this way? Is there something extra that is needed in order to ""expand"" ISO to 12800?  </p>

<p>If not, then presumably the camera is capable of 12800 out of the box — so why not just list <em>that</em> as the max ISO speed?</p>

<p>Similarly, the Nikon D5100 uses <code>Hi1</code> and <code>Hi2</code> instead of numeric ISO settings above 6400. If these are ""real"" ISO settings, why not just call them ISO 6400 and ISO 12800?</p>

<p>What about cameras which have an expanded ISO range on the <em>low</em> side? For example, an expanded ISO setting may allow a choice of 50 rather than 100. Generally,the standard high ISO is very noisy, with the expanded ISO even more so. Are these lower ISOs less noisy than the ""base""?</p>

<p>How do these expanded ISOs affect image quality on either side? Is it better to avoid them and do the equivalent processing with RAW files later, or is there an advantage to using these settings in-camera?</p>
","<p>There are two reasons why an ISO is not made part of the 'normal' range:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is considered a non-trivial drop in quality and you do not want users complaining about its performance. In other words, if the quality difference between ISO 12800 and 6400 is stronger than the one from 3200 to 6400. Note that there may be more changes than simply more noise, colors can be affected as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The camera meters and exposes for the said ISO, say 12800, but the results do not strictly comply with the ISO standard. When that happens, you will notice that the ISO is NOT stored in the EXIF of the image. This usually happens because of a drop in dynamic-range at the expanded setting.</p></li>

"What is the practical difference between phase-detect and contrast-based autofocus?","37977","","<p>What are the main differences in field use between phase detect AF and contrast based AF? </p>

<p>I understand the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6907/how-does-auto-focus-work"">technical differences</a>, but I am not sure what the implications from a photographer standpoint are. Is there a <em>noticeable</em> speed difference? Does one drain the battery faster?</p>
","<p>To put it into manual focus terms, contrast-detect autofocus is like trying to focus an image on a plain ground-glass screen, while phase-detect is like using a split prism focus aid or a rangefinder. In the one scheme, you are looking for a local maximum on a gentle curve, while in the other, you're just looking for things to line up. It's a lot easier to decide when things are lined up than when things are maximally contrasty.</p>

<p>Now, electronics can make the <em>absolute</em> maximum contrast determination faster than we can, since they can be sensitive enough to go back the moment the contrast curve begins to fall, but that's still not quite as easy as comparing two images to see if they line up. And, since a phase-detect system knows which image is which, it should always know in which direction it needs to focus to make the correction. It's always a guess with contrast detection -- you focus in one direction, and if it gets worse instead of better, you reverse direction.</p>

<p>That said, some of the cameras they're making these days have incredible electronics, so there might not be an <em>appreciable</em> difference to the <em>average</em> photographer. Either way, driving the lens (and the backlight for the monitor, if you're using one) is going to be the main source of power drain. Yes, reading the entire imaging sensor is going to ""cost"" more than reading a few (or a single) specialized autofocus sensors, but is it a difference you're going to notice? Probably not. The real drain with contrast-detect AF is usually that you can't use an optical viewfinder, so the monitor (or EVF) is active the whole time, not that the focus system itself is running.</p>

"Why can't I get a decent white background with product photography?","37501","","<p>I'm a new photographer, and I'm trying to take photos of a product with a pure white background (#ffffff). I'm using a light box (something like <a href=""http://nl.aliexpress.com/item/Professional-Portable-Mini-Photo-Studio-Photography-Light-Box-Photo-Box-MK50-For-Network-EBAY-seller/438341420.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>), so my lighting should be solid. </p>

<p>But I can't seem to find the right settings for a good photo. I've taken lots of photos (100+), with a lot of different settings and basically my photos are either overexposed, or the background is not white. Here are some examples:</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on feedback, I have adjusted the exposure parameters and gotten somewhat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/YM0jlDR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">better results</a>, but that that alone doesn't solve the fundamental problem. What else do I need to do to get a pure white background without overexposing the subject?</p>
","<p>There are many improvements that could be made here. Firstly, you need to use a much longer exposure, and a lower ISO setting. Get a tripod, even a cheap one, and use mirror lockup. Could do with stopping down a bit further for depth of field.</p>

<h2>Post processing</h2>

<p>You might be able to get away with your current shots, with some post processing. Here I've taken the second shot and used levels to darken the product whilst leaving the background pure white:</p>

<p><a href=""http://mattgrum.com/photo_se/A3pkpmM.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://mattgrum.com/photo_se/A3pkpmM.jpg</a></p>

<h2>Lighting</h2>

<p>The proper solution is to look at your lighting. The reason that you cant get the right balance no matter what settings you use is that both the product and background are being lit by the same source, so you can only alter the brightness of both, not each one individually.</p>

<p>Usually you'd have one light for your subject and one for the background. This gives you the correct amount of control for optimum results. However that is only if you have a large curved white background. Compact light tents such as the one you're using wont allow you to light your subject individually.</p>

<p>One solution is to <strong>black out any parts of the light tent not visible in the shot</strong>. That way the amount of light hitting your subject will be decreased, making it darker, without affecting the brightness of the background (since you wont touch any parts that are in shot). Get some thick black card, cut it to size and tape it inside the light tent.</p>

"Can I leave the batteries in my camera?","36998","","<p>I recently bought a Canon 1000d DSLR. I'm just an amateur and don't use my camera daily. I use it once or twice a week. Is it okay if I leave the batteries in the camera during this idle time? </p>
","<p>Leaving the batteries in your camera for a week or two between uses will be no problem. If you plan to leave your camera unused for six months to a year, you might want to take them out.</p>

<p>And, the lithium battery pack used in your camera (like most current dSLRs) should hold its charge on the shelf fairly well, so you won't have to worry too much about it being drained just sitting there.</p>

<p>(If you do need to shelve it for a long time, the battery will be best if stored at a little less than half full.)</p>

<p>A few references for further reading: <a href=""http://www.tek.com/document/technical-brief/lithium-ion-battery-maintenance-guidelines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tektronix's Lithium Ion Battery Maintenance Guidelines</a> and <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/02/ask-ars-what-is-the-best-way-to-use-an-li-ion-battery/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ars Technica on What is the best way to use a Li-ion battery?</a>.</p>

<p>Some rare cameras may have problems where the battery is drained by the camera even when the camera is off.

","<p>As far as I know it is a legal thing to prevent extra import duties in the EU. Until Canon or anyone officially state that, it will remain speculation.</p>

<p>It's not a heat issue, as a) if the sensor had heat problems they would likely occur before 30 minutes, and b) after one 30 minute capture the camera will allow you to immediately begin another 30 minute capture!</p>

<p>There is a separate limit of 4GB due to FAT32, you actually hit this limit first if you're recording in full HD resolution. Yes manufacturers could work around it by spanning, but what's the point? DSLRs were never designed to be video cameras, for most people the current limitation should be plenty.

<p>When people talk about a ""tonal range"", they are talking about the difference between the lightest and darkest areas of the picture.

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/mcdeX.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>There's several models of Rebel, then there's the 50D, the 5D, and the 1Ds.</p>

<p>Broadly, which one is for whom broadly?</p>
","<p><strong>The Canon Rebel or EOS XXXXD Series</strong><br> Beginner/Intermediate models for hobby photographers who are transitioning to dSLR's, and looking to start, but within a moderate budget. The difference between the different Rebel cameras you've listed are just subsequent upgrades, and features: more megapixels, HD video, faster burst rate, etc. These camera's are quite capable of producing amazing pictures. What they lack in comparison to the higher priced line-ups are typically features and options. Much like you would expect when going from a base-model car to it's fancier deluxe model. These camera's use an APS-C sensor, which results in a 1.6x Field of View crop when compared to a 35mm film negative. A 100mm lens when used with an APS-C camera will result in a Field of View that is equivalent to 160mm on a 35mm film camera. These bodies make for excellent choices if you are on a budget, new to photography, or not sure how deep you want to get into the world of SLR photography (you aint seen nothing yet, alice).</p>

<p><strong>The Canon 60D or XXD Series</strong><br> This is what has been dubbed the prosumer model. Taking all the features of the Rebel series and adding many more options, to create a camera that suits well for a beginner, but enough features and options that advanced photographers can make use of, resulting in a body that will ""grow"" with you as you advance in your skills. These camera's have a more advanced AF system compared to the Rebel series, have a high burst shot count, making them suitable for action photography, but lack in many of the features found in Canon's pro line. These camera's make for excellent bodies for someone who has experience with SLR photography, or new comer who is serious about getting into photography. For many pro's, these bodies serve as a 3rd body backup (some even using them as 2nd body backups). These bodies are also APS-C bodies, so any lens paired with the body will have a 1.6 FOV crop.</p>

<p><strong>The Canon 5D Mark II/5D Mark III</strong><br> This is Canon's non-professional line Full Frame camera. Unlike the Rebel and XXD series, the 5D Mark II and 5D Mark III have a full frame image sensor. Thus there is no Field of View Crop. They are designed for studio and landscape work, primarily because of the slower burst rate, and AF system. These are more specialized bodies; they are a step up in terms of both features, and image quality from the XXD line, but lack in the high-speed performance that the XXD offers for sports.</p>

<p><strong>The Canon 6D</strong><br> The 6D is Canon's newest and least expensive DSLR sporting a full frame sensor. Unlike the 5D Mark III, the 6D has a cropped viewfinder, allowing the photographer to see only 97% of the frame before shooting. Notable features include built-in WiFi, GPS, HD video, and build quality similar to that of the 5D and 7D.</p>

<p><strong>The Canon 7D</strong><br> What The 5D Mark II is for studio and landscape photography, the 7D is for sports, wildlife and action shots. This is a specialized camera with an AF system, and high burst rate designed to offer sports/action shooters a lot more performance. The 7D is an APS-C 1.6x crop camera, like the Rebel and XXD series.</p>

<p><strong>The Canon 1 Series</strong><br> This is Canon's professional camera line. These are built with the tough demands of professionals in mind. I have seen hobbyist shooters with 1 series bodies (and certainly if money was no object I would have a closet full of 'em). It sports an insane AF system, a tank-like build quality, and a fine degree of control and features that allow users to custom tailor the body for their needs. The bodies are full weather sealed, when paired with a weathersealed lens. The shutters have a very high life expectancy, and it's very common to see used 1 series bodies with shutter actuation counts in the 200,000 range. Canon has two types of 1 Series bodies, each specialized for specific needs:<br>
<code>The Canon 1D Series</code> is designed for the sports/action/wildlife shooter with a very high burst rate, and a highly sensitive AF system tuned to keep the focus on the action. This body is a 1.3x crop factor.<br>
<code>The Canon 1Ds Series</code> is a full framed body ideal for studio and landscape work. It has a very high megapixel count, and has tonal range suitable for studio work.</p>

<p>Now, that isn't to say you can't use the 1Ds for sports, or the 1D for studio work. Either will work, just that the 1D has more features specific to action, compared to the 1Ds.</p>

<p>That also goes to say that you couldn't be a professional photographer using Rebel bodies. All these camera's, when used properly, are capable of producing <em>AMAZING</em> images. It's more that the Canon 1 Series is designed to be used abused in a daily basis, where as the Rebel is not. </p>

<p><strong>For the current lineup:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>One-digit DSLRs are top-of-the-line full-frame cameras.</strong> The higher the number the newer. So D4 is newer than D3. There are sometimes variants such as D3S which is specialized for low-light and D3X which is specialized for high-resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Three-digit DSLRs are semi-professional cameras, both APS-C crop and Full frame.</strong> These include the D800 which also has a D800E variant which lacks an anti-alias filter but is otherwise identical, and the older D700. There is one current APS-C model in this series, the D500. Again here, higher numbers are newer.</li>
<li><strong>Four-digit models have cropped sensors</strong> (APS-C). There are three sub-series here. The semi-professional D7xxx, the basic D5xxx series and the entry-level D3xxx series.</li>

<p><strong>For the older lineup:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2-digit models where lower meant more basic and higher numbers were better</strong>. So a D40 to D60 was entry level and a D70 to D90 was mid-range. These were the last  models of their series as the numbers had no where to go from there.</li>

","<p>So, here's what I got in just a few minutes using two basic tools: <em>Curves</em>, and <em>Unsharp mask</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9p6ct.jpg"" alt=""replication attempt""></p>

<p>I used Gimp, but this is basic stuff any decent image editing software will have. Here's all I did. First, I used the curves tool to dramatically increase the black point, increasing shadow contrast:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IMoqB.png"" alt=""shadow contrast up""></p>

<p>Then, I pulled the curve upwards to brighten the (new) midtones:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYdQd.png"" alt=""more midtones""></p>

<p>I didn't mess with the color channels at all; this is all the global ""value"" curve. I made these adjustments by eye, watching the tone of the house as I worked.</p>

<p>Having done that, I resized to 612×612 (the size of your Instagram example here), and then used an <em>Unsharp Mask</em> with a radius of 10 pixels and a very high strength.</p>

<p>This doesn't look exactly like your image, but I think we're in the ballpark.</p>

<p>There's a sort of glow over the lower part of the house that's missing, and I couldn't replicate this with global adjustments without destroying the tones in the sky and the detail on on the tree branches on the left; I suspect that the filter applies a graduated vignette/glow/""light leak"" effect somewhere in the pipeline here. If you compare the top half of my attempt to the Instagram output, you'll see they're really close; the difference is in the lower part.</p>

<p>The original has flat lighting; this fake burst is part of what adds dynamic interest, but which also feels a little bit like cheating: Instagram is not <em>just</em> capturing what's there with a funky filter, but altering the reality of the scene.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: this is with just an upsharp mask with radius 100 and strength in Gimp of 2.0 (Photoshop measures strength differently, but basically, about 10× higher than one would normally use if going for a natural looking image).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pl5VH.jpg"" alt=""with just unsharp mask""></p>

<p>The curves approach gives a lot more control and it's still what I recommend, but for quick and dirty replication of the effect, this might be all you need.</p>

"How do I get Canon EOS 5D Mark II RAW files using a USB cable and bypassing the EOS utility?","35671","","<p>I had my CF card reader die on me a few times (i.e., it suddenly stopped working: instead of being recognised, and then allowing me to access the CF card, it was ""cycling"", i.e., appearing/disappearing from Windows). So I decided to do a backup using an USB cable.</p>

<p>What happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My PC had [historically] the EOS utility installed</p></li>
<li><p>For personal reasons (mostly: special workflow, and avoiding the clumsy download interface) I wanted to just copy the files over, <em>bypassing</em> the EOS utility</p></li>
<li><p>However, when plugging the USB cable between the 5DMkII and the PC, it only got recognised as the camera, and when exploring that I could see each image <em>twice</em> in JPEG (one with extension, the other without, but both JPEG, whereas I know that on the CF one is .JPG, and the other .CR2, larger and with more details). I tried, however, to copy both, each in separate directories (as they had the same name), but it really ended up as two identical files each time, as if it ""hides"" the raw and instead shows another instance of the associated JPEG file. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Example: using a CF reader I would get IMG_0001.JPG and IMG_0001.CR2, the 2nd raw and much larger in details and size. Via cable I saw ""IMG_0001"" and ""IMG_0001.JPG"", both ending up as ""IMG_0001.JPG"" on my computer, and no raw file...</p>

<p>How can I retrieve the .CR2 files? (if possible, without uninstalling the EOS utility! But still bypassing it... I.e., how do I use a USB cable to access the files as if by a card reader?) (Should I boot on some linux boot CD and try from there?)</p>
","<p>First of all, I always recommend a card reader instead of a direct USB connection. It will be faster, you don't need special software, and it doesn't use your battery while downloading. I prefer the current USB 3.0 readers but many options exist.</p>

<p>This looks like what you are looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>GNU Canon Camera Utilities - <a href=""http://canoncam.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://canoncam.sourceforge.net/</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Overall I think that the EOS Utility is really the way to go for direct USB transfers. The other options seem to be either complex, incomplete, or non-existent. Beyond that, I would advise picking up a USB card reader as they are typically much faster and also don't drain your battery.</p>

<p>Does one generally get the same thing from different brands at the same price point, or is it important to shop around and look closely at the details? </p>

<hr>

<p>I saw this <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8333/what-kind-of-backdrop-works-best-for-a-home-studio-setup"">general question</a>, but I'd like to focus on the more specific here. I'll worry about size and setup separately.</p>
","<p>You might want to keep in mind that I've been out of the pro game for a while, and that I tend to shoot people ""in the wild"" these days, so I'm not entirely up to date on the latest offerings. I was really hoping to see some other input here from people who have more recent experience in a professional studio environment, but here goes:</p>

<h3>Canvas</h3>

<p>Canvas is extremely durable, but it's not particularly portable or storable. As a painted fabric, it's well-suited for surface cleaning (wiping with a cloth or sponge); as a dyed fabric you need to allow for light colours to become somewhat dingier over time and for darks to fade -- dry cleaning, as opposed to laundering, helps, as does dark storage in a sealed bag. White isn't very white unless the canvas is painted (bleaching only gets you so far), so you need space to light the background separately if you want anything that's <em>apparently</em> white. (We'll take it as read that if you want ""digitally white"", you need to overexpose <em>any</em> background.)</p>

<p>Canvas can be fairly heavy; even the lighter grades of cotton duck sold as ""canvas"" are in the 10-12oz. region and painted finishes add considerably to that, so you need a sturdy support (not necessarily a certified and approved official background stand set, but a couple of thumbtacks aren't going to do it). It takes and shows wrinkles and creases, although they will relax into near invisibility over time if the canvas is dyed and unsized (and can be ironed out). Painted canvas really needs to be treated like roll paper; the binder in the paint (even if there is no visible paint film) makes creases and wrinkles very prominent. It's great stuff for swappable scenics or a durable seamless, but they really need to be kept either hung or rolled (and may take days of hanging to become usable if they were folded, even around a form, when you purchased them).</p>

<p>Synthetics may have changed the game a bit since I last looked; I can imagine that something other than dropcloth-grade cotton duck (which was the base fabric for all of the lighter canvasses I've worked with) might be somewhat better-behaved, but I haven't seen any evidence of them in my local pro photo emporia.</p>

<h3>Muslin</h3>

<p>I don't know what the kids are doing with muslin these days, but in my day it was the location alternative to mottled canvas backdrops. Not only is muslin much lighter and slightly cheaper, it takes wrinkles better. Yep, that was the point. Getting canvas to a location meant either bringing an unwieldy long roll of fabric with you, folding it neatly and having a regular pattern of creases (which look like a bad web page background image), or having a very prominent spider web of irregular creases. Canvas is a heavy fabric; it only scrunches up so much. Muslin, on the other hand, is very lightweight and glories in the ability to take an almost fractal irregular creased texture if you just sort of scrunch it up and stuff it into a bag. When that texture is combined with the soft mottling that's usually applied, it just sort of disappears. If you want a plain background, then you need to treat muslin with almost the same care as canvas.</p>

<p>Muslins do tend to be made from a higher grade of thread than canvasses (the source looms and threads are used for things like bed linens rather than industrial applications and grounds for painting on when they're not doing their twenty minutes a year of photographic applications). That means that the results of bleaching and dying tend to be better -- you can get a good white and intense, bright colours without painting, as well as darks with no sheen. But wrinkling and creases are always going to be a problem if you need to store or move them.</p>

<h3>Jersey (Knits)</h3>

<p>Jerseys tend to get around the wrinkling and creaing problem very neatly, and because of that they make great solid-colour backgrounds. Being fabrics, of course they are going to wrinkle and crease, but those wrinkles and creases can be stretched out easily. But like the man said, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

<p>Jersey's don't just hang there; they pretty much need to be stretched. If you put a plain jersey background panel on a standard background stand, the top may be the advertised width, but it's going to taper down to this little six-inch wide cylinder at the bottom. You need to clamp the fabric to the uprights in oder to maintain width, and the clamps need to be frequent enough to avoid creating a visible diamond pattern due to variations in the tension. And it's pretty much a background-only material; it doesn't do well as a seamless, even if you try to stretch and weight the perimeter of the piece on the floor/table. (The stretchiness means that there's almost always a bubble popping up somewhere.) It makes a fantastic pop-up, though, and it works great on a frame -- wrinkles just vanish.</p>

<p>And there's the pilling problem. If you never need to clean the fabric, it can stay looking new for a very long time. If you do need to wash it, you need to remember that you're dealing with something that's really just an oversized tee shirt. Washing it by hand in cold water in the bathtub by squeezing (no agitation) and hanging to dry works well, but anything rougher than that will pretty much ruin it. If it's something that going to experience a lot of rough-and-tumble, it's the wrong fabric.</p>

<h3>Velour/Velvet</h3>

<p>These make great solid colours (assuming we're not talking about the ""crushed"" variety) and there is no substitute for black velvet as an absolute black apart from immense distance -- light goes in and it doesn't come back out. The nap hides wrinkles and creases in the base fabric very well. For lighter/brighter colours, you may need to brush the surface of the nap in order to avoid apparent colour changes (one of those large blackboard erasers that's essentially a foam rubber block with a stick inside of it and a chamois glued over one face is <em>very</em> quick and effective for this). Velvet/velour is great for solid whites, solid absolute blacks, and for chromakey-type colours, and a white or grey panel combined with gelled lighting can make for very smooth gradients. Velvets can be surprisingly light (although some, made as coating fabrics -- that is, fabric suitable in weight to be used for coats -- and those based on a jersey knit rather than a weave, can be surprisingly heavy).</p>

<p>Velvets and velours, though, are lint magnets, and the lighter colours can pick up handling grime quickly. They are absolutely not suitable for seamless applications where anything heavy (like a person or even a large tabletop subject) is involved -- raising the nap again after it has been thoroughly crushed is a bear of a job.</p>

<p>There's a huge range of washability -- the name really only tells you what the surface of the fabric looks like; it doesn't tell you much about the underlying construction. Some will go bald if you look at them funny, some will felt, others will laugh at your ""hot"" water and puny washing machines. Some will dry quickly and easily, others will absorb Lake Superior in a single gulp and be ready to use again next February if you're lucky. It's probably safe to assume that any company that depends on the goodwill of professional photographers (Lastolite, Photek, Photoflex, Westcott, and so forth) will sell you something suitable for the purpose; but as with anything else in life, I'd be wary of anything priced at the ""too good to be true"" level -- it may work well out of the box, but it's probably disposable.</p>

<h3>Really, Truly White</h3>

<p>If you are working an a small space (no real room for separately lighting the background evenly from the front) and need something that's digitally white rather than merely apparently white (that is, something that doesn't merely look white to the viewer, and can have shadows, but that will actually be all Fs when you look at the values), then it may be worth looking at backlighting. Commercially, that means using an enormous softbox or something like Lastolite's Hilite background system (which is essentially a shallow sidelit softbox). A DIY version wouldn't be too difficult to create -- the only piece that's critical is the diffusion panel, and that's really only ""critical"" in the sense that it needs to be seamless (one piece). The rest is just reflective fabric (that can be the cheapest silver lamé you can find at the fabric store, and can be full of seams everywhere) and a frame to hang it on (PVC, anyone?).</p>

"How does automatic sensor cleaning work?","35179","","<p>My Canon 5D MKIII DSLR often does sensor cleaning when powered off and occasionally I'll go through the menu and specifically run a sensor clean when I've been shooting in unusually hazardous environments like caves. But aside from a weird 'bzzt' noise that I hear and the mirror clacking up and down, I actually have no idea how its working on what its doing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How effective is this compared to say using a blower (or any
alternative methods)?</p></li>
<li><p>Does 'over cleaning' (manually re-running the sensor clean many times) damage the sensor/mechanics at all?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the sensor actually remove dust?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens to the removed dust?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most effective AND safest way to clean the sensor?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>You've asked several different questions, so here goes:</p>

<ol>
<li>How effective is it? It is a lot more effective in cameras that have it than those that don't. Not trying to be a smarty-pants, but since most manufacturers adopted automatic self cleaning systems, the number of complaints regarding dusty sensors went down by several orders of magnitude. See labnut's answer to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10720/how-effective-are-in-camera-integrated-sensor-cleaning-systems-and-have-they-im?rq=1"">this question</a>. For how to utilize it effectively, see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/3545/does-it-matter-which-way-the-camera-is-orientated-for-the-sensor-cleaning-to-wor"">this question</a>.</li>
<li>Compared to a blower? It depends on the type of dust or other substance. Normal dust is fairly easy to remove. The problem with using blowers is that they often introduce more dust into the system than they remove. Always use a blower with a filtered intake valve that is opposite the exhaust nozzle. Otherwise you are just swishing dust back and forth. Dust that has been damp is a little harder because it causes the dust to be more strongly attached to the surface it lands on. Other substances, such as the lubricants used inside the camera body, can be a gooey mess that neither an automatic cleaning system nor a blower can remove.</li>
<li>Can you overuse the automatic dust removal system and damage the sensor/mechanical parts? With any mechanical device there will eventually be enough wear for the device to fail. But if there was a problem with the use of automatic dust cleaning routines
causing damage to cameras, we would have heard about it by now. They've been pretty widespread for about half a decade now. One would assume they will last longer than other parts, particularly the shutter mechanism which is usually the first internal part to wear out.</li>
<li>How does it work? Most systems use a piezo crystal ultrasonic vibration of the IR filter in front of the sensor. They vibrate at around 35-50K Hz. Olympus invented it, but now Leica, Panasonic, Canon, and Nikon use similar systems. Other manufacturers use sensor shifting. The sensor itself is shaken at about 100 Hz, but the length of travel is much further. Konica Minolta developed it. Sony and Pentax now use this method. Both systems usually include a coating that is negatively charged, just as most dust is. This causes them to repel each other.</li>
<li>What happens to the dust? When vibrated off the IR filter, it should fall down to the bottom of the sensor where a dust trap collects it. We think of dust as not being affected by gravity, but this is a false assumption. Dust will fall unless the force of air currents around it creates more frictional force than that of gravity, unless there is an electrical charge acting on the dust that is stronger than gravity, or unless a combination of both air and static charge is stronger than gravity. Air molecules that are affected by Brownian motion are much smaller than dust particles. Inside the mirror box there is not a source of moving air to suspend the dust in the air for any length of time. Some designs actually use air motion to help the dust move towards the trap below the sensor. They generate this very weak air motion by the designed shape of moving parts in the dust cleaning system.</li>
<li>What's the most effective and safe way to clean a sensor? There isn't one. There are more effective methods, and there are safer methods. They are generally inversely proportional to each other. The methods, in order from lowest to highest risk factor are: Automatic dust removal system, air blower (with a filtered intake), electrically charged brush, and wet cleaning systems that use swabs and cleaning fluid.</li>

"How does the lens diameter influence photo quality?","34995","","<p>I have tested two different 50mm lenses in my camera. One was a Nikkor 50mm ∅52mm. The other one was a Sigma 50mm ∅72mm.

<p>So, how does the diameter affects the photo quality, if it does? What advantages would the ∅72mm lens have over the ∅52mm one?</p>
","<p>It's not just about maximum aperture. Even in two lenses with the same focal length and max aperture, one could have a larger diameter.  The larger diameter could be because of using larger lens elements, which could have advantages with regard to sharpness and light falloff at the edges of the image circle. Some lenses may even project a larger image circle than is strictly necessary. These difference would likely be more apparent at larger apertures (especially wide-open), if they are there at all.</p>

<p>Why is one 5MP camera so much better than the other? I think not only the megapixel values but also camera lens needs to be considered while buying a camera... right?</p>
","<p>You're right. Picture quality is as complex as, say, how well a food item tastes. Megapixels only tell you the number of pixels the picture is made up of, and more is certainly not always better. More pixels on a small sensor means more noise. Megapixels are often used by marketing just because people want simple truths, like 18 MP must be better than 10. However, that's like comparing two cups of coffee based on the quantity in the cup - and saying the one with more in the cup must be better. But, how does it actually taste?</p>

<p>So, like the coffee, what those pixels contain is the critical part. Of course, it needs to be said, what is meant by quality is also subjective. Instagram filters for example often simulate old camera defects, like vignetting, noise and color shift, still they often come across as great looking photos, right? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4SpV.jpg"" alt=""http://nenuno.co.uk/creative/design/inspiration/10-vignette-photos-for-inspiration/""></p>

<p><em>Underexposed photo with dark corners, i e vignetting. Originally a lens imperfection, it's often used creatively because it helps frame the picture.</em> </p>

<p>Anyhow, subjectivity out of the way. <strong>Main factors for pure image quality are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sensor quality (low noise, high dynamic range, and so on - all of which get better with a large sensor)</li>
<li>Lens quality (sharpness, lack of chromatic abberation, quality of bokeh etc)</li>
<li>Camera firmware, i e ability to use RAW format, or create JPEG files with good quality. </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, it's important to understand that lighting plays a HUGE role in how the photo turns out, so if your friend shoots indoors and you outdoors for example, yours are likely going to look infinitely more high quality. <strong>Cameras wanna bathe in light!</strong> Here's a guy even doing a fashion shoot with his 3 Megapixel iPhone 3GS, and it looks absolutely stunning thanks to high quality lighting, and the camera being just good enough to capture it.

<p>There's definitely a lower threshold for being able to capture that, and I'd say an old Nokia phone from the late-mid 2000's would still show pretty low quality even in great lighting, it's just really a bad camera. </p>

","<p>When you are in Camera RAW, make whatever adjustments you like, then press the shift key. The open button changes to Open Object. This gives you a re-editable object -- i.e., you can dive back into Camera RAW if you like simply by double-clicking the smart object layer.</p>

<p>All of that said, if you make any raster level adjustments in Photoshop -- say a spotting / healing layer, then go back into Camera RAW to tweak the color balance, all your dust busting will be the wrong color. There are techniques for working with Smart Objects, but at the end of most post-processing, you have to commit to some pixel-level stuff otherwise you wouldn't have broken out a big hammer like Photoshop in the first place, right?</p>

","<p>Given that gear, you'll get the maximum bokeh effect by zooming <strike>out to 18mm</strike> <em>in to 55mm</em>, going aperture priority mode (Av) and setting the aperture to <strike>3.5</strike> <em>5.6</em> which is the maximum aperture on that lens at that focal length.</p>

<p>You have a combination of a crop sensor (less visible bokeh) combined with a lens that maxes out at f/3.5 at the wide end (less obvious bokeh than lenses which go to a wider aperture).  That lens has a variable aperture, so as you zoom closer in towards 55mm your widest aperture will be further limited <em>but as seen in other answers, this is less significant than other factors</em>.</p>

<p>Do these apps really work, or are they gimmicks? Can they get the same information from a scene that a real device can?

<blockquote>

<p>They really work, within the limits of what the built-in camera allows. They may not be able to measure really dim light, for example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can they get the same information from a scene that a real device can? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can they be used as incident-light meters without additional physical attachments like a diffuser dome?</p>

<p>No. You either need a diffuser dome like <a href=""http://www.esdevices.com/products/luxi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Luxi</a> or an add-on incident meter like <a href=""http://www.lu.mu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lumu</a> </p>

<p>To within 1/10 stop (the limits of my measuring capability) if done correctly. </p>

<p>Many apps use the camera's own exposure setting, so can vary by nearly a stop at times from what a meter might see (smartphone cameras often ""expose to the right"" a bit to maximize SNR). iOS devices provide a ""brightness value"" in their EXIF data stream, and that value appears to track external meters pretty much exactly. Apps that use the brightness value, or that do image analysis on captured pix to compensate for the camera's ETTR behavior, should track an external meter to within a tenth of a stop.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do the phone apps have any advantages?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>""The best lightmeter is the one you have with you.""</li>
<li>Cost: if you already have the phone, a metering app is a cheap add-on. If you don't have a phone, an iPod touch works fine, and it's cheaper than a standalone meter.</li>
<li>Features: an app can add things like a false-color display or a waveform monitor to help in visualizing how the light falls on a scene and to look at contrast ratios. If they enable the front-facing camera, you can use 'em for reflected-reading ""lightmeter selfies"", using yourself as a model before your talent arrives. Also, when taking reflected readings, they show you <em>exactly</em> what the ""meter"" is seeing.</li>

Are the Sony NEX or Olympus PEN of this format? Are there any other interchangeable lens digital non-SLR formats one can look into?</p>

<p>EDIT:<br/>
Nikon D7000 is the upper-limit of affordable for me ;-)</p>
","<p>If you're looking specifically for a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rangefinder camera</a> &ndash; in that you do not look through the lens and use a split-image mechanism to match subject distance to the plane of focus of the lens &ndash; with a digital sensor, the only ones available are the Leicas (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M9#Leica_M-E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">M-E</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M_(camera)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">M</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">M9</a> with some minor variants). Although they are likely to go down in value over time (like almost all digital cameras), those are probably outside your budget.</p>

<p>If you're looking for something that <em>looks</em> like a Leica but isn't necessarily a rangefinder camera, probably the closest current camera is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujifilm_X-Pro1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fuji X-Pro1</a>. It is similar to a digital Leica M in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>It lacks a flipping mirror mechanism</li>
<li>You do not look directly through the lens to compose; instead, you look through a viewfinder with overlaid frame lines</li>
<li>The X-Pro1 looks an awful lot like a film rangefinder camera</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the X-Pro1 has the following differences from the M cameras:</p>

<ul>
<li>The X-Pro1 uses Fujifilm's new X mount, while the M uses the long-established <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M_mount"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">M mount</a>.</li>
<li>The X-Pro1 has a ""<a href=""http://www.finepix-x100.com/en/x100/hybrid-viewfinder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hybrid viewfinder</a>"" that overlays an electronic preview in the viewfinder. </li>
<li>The M9 or M-E or older have no sort of ""live view"" that allows you to compose with the digital screen instead of the viewfinder.</li>
<li>The X-Pro1 has autofocus, while all Leica rangefinders are manual focus only.</li>
<li>The X-Pro1 has an APS-C size sensor (like most digital SLRs), while the M9 or newer, M-9, and M-E have a larger 'full frame' (roughly equivalent to 35mm film) size sensor. The M8's sensor is in between those two sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fujifilm also has the new X-E1 (similar to the X-Pro1 but uses a fully electronic viewfinder instead of a hybrid viewfinder) and the X100 (with a fixed 35mm equivalent lens instead of an interchangable lens mount.</p>

<p>If interchangeable lenses are important to you, you might also look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_PEN_E-P1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Olympus Pen series</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic_GF1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Panasonic GF/GX series</a>, or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_E-mount"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sony NEX</a> line.
Like the Leica, these cameras do not have a reflex mirror and are part of interchangeable lens systems. Unlike a Leica, they use some sort of electronic viewfinder or you compose using the digital screen on the back. Also, all of these cameras have autofocus.</p>

<p>If you specifically want the experience of using a rangefinder but can live without an actual digital camera, you could use a film rangefinder and then have the film scanned. Leica and Cosina (using the Voigtlander and Zeiss brand names) still make new film rangefinders, and there are many available for on the used market.</p>

","<p>Thankfully LCD/LED screens are much easier to photograph than old CRT screens, but there are still a good number of things that can go wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Glare</strong> - this is light reflecting on the monitor and obscuring the image, move the camera around so you don't see the reflection or place something between the monitor and light source to block the light.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image too dark/bright</strong> - the camera will assume you are photographing something that has middle brightness, a mostly white monitor will be under exposed and a mostly black monitor will be over exposed, with a ""real"" camera use exposure compensation (or manual mode) to get the brightness just right, with an iPhone tap the screen to focus on a part of the screen that is middle brightness (middle gray works best).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vertical/horizontal stripes</strong> - those are caused by flicker in the florescent tube on the back of the LCD screen (theoretically shouldn't happen on LED screens, but I don't have one here to test it), you have to set the camera's shutter speed so it catches an entire cycle (if you're power is 50Hz 1/50 or 1/25 will do, if your power is 60Hz 1/60 or 1/30 - USA is 60, most of Europe is 50) - I have no idea how to do this with an iPhone</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Round stripes</strong> - this is moire pattern, it is caused by the camera behind fooled by the ""grid lines"" between pixels - move in closer, move out farther or change angle until they disappear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Random dots</strong> - this is noise, any acceptable camera (including the iPhone) will only produce visible noise in low light conditions and a screen is pretty bright so this shouldn't be an issue - but it can happen outside the screen or in dark areas of the screen - you can try to play with the screen brightness or add more light (add light for off-screen noise only, and be careful about glare) - in this case it's probably best to remove noise in post-processing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strange color casts</strong> - this can be caused by the fluorescent flicker (and solved by setting the shutter speed) or bad white balance - to correctly set the white balance with a good camera shoot raw and adjust in post or crate a custom white balance based on a blank white screen, with an iPhone (or a P&amp;S that doesn't support custom white balance) focus on an area that is pure white or neutral gray (to also control brightness it better be middle gray)</p></li>

<p>And about type of photography I want to do, I was thinking birds mostly, but also anything good thats far enough! =)
Auto focus is also reviewed as faster in Tamron considering the time it takes to focus from MFD to Infinity. Focus is acurate and with the help of FTM, you can fine tune as well. (after all its their anniversary lens!). Its slightly sharper than Canon beyond 200mm but also slightly softer than Canon below 200.</p>

","<p>What I'd probably do - and I don't suggest you follow it in this particular case - is get the Canon lens, given from your description that the lenses are a very close match. This is because I am (sadly) a lens snob...

The chances of getting a good copy are greater with the Canon.</p>

<p>That's not to discourage you from trying both and if you get a good copy of the Tamron and feel that the build quality is better (as you mentioned in your question), then by all means get it.</p>

","<p>Even if you knew the exact amount of free space remaining on your memory card you could still only guess the approximate number of remaining frames you could add to the card. It is, in fact, exactly what your camera is already doing for you.</p>

<p>This is because even RAW files are compressed, albeit losslessly, and so the exact size of a file depends upon the content of the file. The more uniform the data in a frame is, the smaller the resulting file will be. The more varied the data in a frame is, the larger the resulting file will be. A photo of a uniformly lit gray wall will can be compressed into a much smaller file than a photo of a spectacular fall foliage scene that includes almost every variation of tone, shade, and color that the camera is capable of recording.</p>

Both save RAW files in 14-bit depth. So if I have room for 10 'average' photos on my 5DII, I might fit as many as 12 or as few as 7 more shots on the card, depending on the content of the photos and how far they compress.</p>

"What is the difference between halftoning and dithering?","33218","","<p>As I understand it, halftoning is the process of taking an image with a given color range (as defined by the colorspace) and blending the colors to form an image with a smaller range of colors.</p>

<p>How is this different from dithering? Or are the two essentially the same thing?</p>
","<p>I disagree with John's assertion that the difference depends on how many colours you use, I believe it's possible to dither using a single colour.</p>

<p>Halftoning is a term used in the print industry to describe how to reproduce varying tones with significantly fewer inks. It's usually synonymous with <strong>amplitude modulation</strong> halftoning, where a fixed pattern of dots vary in size in order to create the illusion of continuous tone.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/dithering_vs_halftoning.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/dithering_vs_halftoning.png</a></p>

<p><em>Left: two examples of monochrome dithering, firstly pattern dithering and secondly diffusion dithering. Right: two examples of colour halftoning by amplitude modulation, the first with a very large dot size, the second with a smaller dot size that is more convincing.</em></p>

<p>When colour halftoning, the grid of circles for each ink colour are set at different angles so they don't land on top of each other. </p>

<p>Dithering is a more general term that refers to randomisation or perturbation of colours values or positions or intensity in order to simulate more tones than are available. Essentially both terms try to achieve the same effect, to fool the eye into seeing more colours than are there, and you could argue that halftoning is a form of dithering. </p>

<p>Like all terms they are misused, but to me the difference is that you wouldn't usually talk about halftoning if you were working with images for display on a computer. Whereas, if you were talking about printing then you would usually use halftoning to refer to amplitude modulation (little circles), and dithering otherwise.</p>

"How to Force my Nikon D5000 to take a photo in low light?","33064","","<p>Every so often I try to take a picture in low light, usually indoors and find that my camera attempts to focus, grumbles a bit and then refuses to take the shot.</p>

<p>This is annoying, not least because I entered the bewildering and expensive world of dSLR photography precisely so I could get away from the 'point and shoot' paradigm and its restrictions and thought that a dSLR would give me total control over what I wanted to shoot. I might still want to take the picture whether I think the light is poor or not...</p>

<p>Am I missing something here - is there some kind of override setting or have i inadvertently snookered myself out of five hundred quid?</p>
","<p>It is simply too dark for the camera to focus. And by default it will refuse to take the shot unless it has focused.</p>

<p>There are some possible workarounds:
- Some cameras can be forced to take the shot when you press the button, no matter what. The inevitable result is an unsharp photo. I don't suppose that this is what you want.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I assume that you are using the kit lens, an 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 kind of job? The downside to this type of lens is that it doesn't let in a whole lot of light, which makes the autofocus system's job more difficult. A faster lens, such as a 35mm or 50mm f/1.8 will do wonders for autofocus performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware that autofocus depends on focusing something that has a bit of contrast. If you point it towards a blank wall, it will most likely simply hunt and hunt and never lock on. Poor light makes this worse. Instead, point it at a part of the motive that has good contrast against the background, this will make the AF's job easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Manual focus. The viewfinder of the entry-level cameras tend to be tunnel-like but you will at least get a photo this way.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a flash, either the built-in one or an external one. External flashes, at least the larger models, can project a grid-pattern on to the motive to aid focusing. The built-in ones tend to strobe a number of times I think, which is not all about red-eye reduction but also helps focusing. (I am not familiar with your camera model but suspect that it does not have a separate autofocus illumination lamp and depends on the flash for this.)</p></li>

"Are Canon EOS and Nikon DSLR lenses interchangeable?","32491","","<p>Can we use the lenses from, say a Canon EOS 550D kit (Canon EF-S 18-55mm) with a Nikon DSLR D5000 for example) ? Also, is the reverse possible ?</p>

<p>I'm looking at interchangeability between recent DSLR lenses only, and not with older lenses. Also, for ""average"" lenses, and not ultra wide/ultra zoom.</p>

<p>The reason for this question is that I'm trying to decide between a Nikon D5000 and a Canon EOS 500D. I like the Nikon better, but Canon is more popular here amongst people I can interchange lenses with :) </p>
","<p>Nikon has the longest flange to focal-plane distance, so you can't use lenses meant for other 35mm lens-mounts on Nikon cameras (the lens would be too far from the sensor/film to focus to infinity). The exception might be if you were doing closeup/macro photography and didn't care about infinity focus. There are some medium-format lenses that can be adapted for use on Nikon cameras, though.</p>

<p>Canon has one of the shorter flange to focal-plane distances, so lenses for other mounts can more easily be adapted to Canon EOS (even with the extra spacing of the adapter in place, the lens is still close enough to the sensor/film to focus on infinity).</p>

<p>Adapting Nikon lenses to use on Canon cameras is a pretty common thing to do. For instance, lots of Canon shooters use adapters with Nikon's wide-angle lenses, which are particularly well-regarded. </p>

<p>One note about adapting Nikon lenses for use on Canon bodies. You'll either want to get the older lenses that have a physical aperture ring; or you'll need to get a special ""G"" adapter that allows you to set the shooting aperture on Nikon's 'G' lenses that have no physical aperture ring. Also, there's no adapter I know of that will work with Nikon's new PC-E lenses, since they have a completely different aperture control mechanism (currently only the three tilt/shift lenses are PC-E, though).</p>

<p>Another consideration is that adapted lenses are going to be completely manual-focus, and you may also lose in-camera metering (best you can hope for is probably spot- or center-weighted metering in manual exposure mode, maybe aperture mode if you're really lucky). So unless you have a specific reason for wanting to use a specific lens, it's probably not worth the trouble. I wouldn't recommend getting an adapter just so you can share lenses with friends. If all your friends shoot Canon and you want to be able to share lenses, you should go with a Canon DSLR. </p>

"What does the number of elements and groups in a lens mean?","32450","","<p>All lens specifications include a statement of how many <strong>elements</strong> the lens contains, and in how many <strong>groups</strong>, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikon AF-S VR <strong>Zoom</strong>-NIKKOR 70-300 mm 1:4,5-5,6G: <strong>17 elements in 12 groups</strong> (two ED glass elements); </li>
<li>Nikon AF DX <strong>Fisheye</strong>-NIKKOR 10,5 mm 1:2,8G ED: <strong>10 elements in 7 groups</strong></li>
<li>Nikon AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor <strong>18-55mm</strong> F/3.5-5.6 G ED II (kit): <strong>7 elements in 5 groups</strong></li>
<li>Nikon AF-S <strong>MICRO</strong> NIKKOR 60mm/2.8G ED: <strong>12 elements in 9 groups</strong></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this signify? How is this important for the lens? Does it make a difference in image quality? What is better: fewer or more elements/groups? Or does it not matter — in which case, why they are included in the specification? </p>
","<p>I think manufacturers list the number of elements it just so you know how much effort they put into a lens!</p>

<p>There's no simple answer to whether more of fewer elements is preferable. More elements generally means greater correction for distortion, chromatic aberration etc. however this extra correction might be necessary due to the design or the performance characteristics of the lens, not a sign of better image quality. Elements are often paired up, so the number of groups gives you a better idea of the number of corrections.</p>

<p>However the more bits of glass the light travels through the more surfaces there are for reflections etc. so contrast and sharpness can be reduced. As an example, let's compare the Canon 50mm f/1.0L with the Canon 50mm f/1.8II</p>

<p>First the f/1.0 version:</p>

<p><img src=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160624100008if_/http://eflens.com/images/EF_50mm_f1L_USM/ef_50_10l_usm_bd.gif""/></p>

<p><strong>11 elements in 9 groups</strong></p>

<p>Now the f/1.8 version</p>

<p><img src=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130520200214/http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/lens/ef/data/standard/diagram/ef_50_18ii_bd.gif""/></p>

<p><strong>6 elements in 5 groups</strong></p>

<p>Now stop both down to f/8 and the II would almost certainly be sharper. But which is better? You can't really say, because the first version has an ultra wide max aperture. It's a high performance lens which necessitates a lot of optical correction.</p>

<p>Even comparing the degree of correction can be misleading. You'd think that a better corrected lens is preferable, but it can lead to other defects. Correcting for spherical aberration in particular often makes the bokeh worse (which is why some lenses leave it uncorrected). Lens design is all about compromise.</p>

<p>So in summary, the number of elements/groups can be informative, but it's very rarely an absolute measure of quality or a reason to prefer a specific lens. The more important factors are the inclusion of special types of glass, such as low dispersion, (extra low dispersion) or flourite elements, and aspherical elements which perform better but are harder to make.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>What can I do to prevent fogging within the GoPro case when I take it out on the water?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An important assumption that you must confirm is that the condensation is due to moisture present inside the canera at sealing time and is NOT caused by water ingress during operation. IF the camera is sucking in water then you have a pronlem that must be repaired. </p>

<p>If the condensation is due to moisture in the air in the camera it usually occurs because the outer is cooled to below the dew point of the injternal air. You overcome this by lowering the dw point of the internal air, which you do by drying it.</p>

<p>You can dry air with a dessicant OR by cooling it to below its dew point so that water precipitates out. So ...</p>

<p>Some mix of:</p>

<p>1 - Use a desiccant inside the camera. silica gel is one. There are others available commercially. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiccant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia is useful</a> They note - </p>

<ul>
<li>. Some commonly used desiccants are: silica gel, activated charcoal, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, montmorillonite clay, and molecular sieves. I have been very impressed with both <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmorillonite_clay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Montmorillonite_clay</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_chloride"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Calcium Chloride</a>.. Both of these can make a mess by liberating liquid water after capture if arranged poorly BUT a properly designed system can capture and retain far more water than you should have inside your housing. </li>
</ul>

<p>2 - Close case when air is as cold as possible (low RH for a given situation).
If you seal the case at home or in an environment when power is available you could use a modest peltier cooler to achieve lower temperatures than you will otherwise be likey to get. </p>

<p>3 - Use dry air when sealing. eg pump air though a dessicant with a squeeze bulb or similar and flush inside of camera with this air before sealing. Doing this when the air is cool is a bonus.</p>

<hr>

<p>Choice 1 can be used in conjunction with others.</p>

<p>Choice 3 is arguably the most ""real"" one as it provides air that is as dry as you can reasonably make it. Even better if it is cool when sealed as the RH will drop as the temperature rises. </p>

Two different display types may simply be incapable of producing the same color gamut, brightness levels, evenness of illumination, contrast, etc. </p>

Most touch screen technologies also affect image quality, because they put arrays of microscopic stuff in between the actual LCD and your eyes.</p>

<p>You might feel that these difficulties make calibration pointless, but it isn't so. Proper calibration brings your monitor as close to the objective ideal as its technology makes possible. If you edit your photos on a properly-calibrated monitor, they will also look good on other calibrated monitors, even if they don't look exactly the same as on yours. On uncalibrated monitors, your photos may not look as good as you would like, but that's unavoidable; this was true before you calibrated your display, too.</p>

<p>Nonsense. Your external display is almost certainly a better display, objectively speaking, so do your actual photo edits on that monitor. Use the laptop display for auxiliary things, such as app palettes, email, a web browser, etc.</p>

  <p>I don't really ""trust"" it, seems even after calibration, manual and with the Spyder, it's still really bright and saturated. My pics look really good straight from the camera, it seems really weird to have such quality from my old camera to be honest. Also it looks like all my old pictures suffer too much contrast due to my former photoshop editing - but they dont look so contrasted on the prints i used for an exhibition a while ago. I'm lost!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of the box, most displays are too bright. Manufacturers do that to make them ""pop"" under bright fluorescent retail store lighting. Home and office lighting is typically much dimmer, so you need to turn the display brightness down quite a bit.</p>

<p>Calibration should have taken care of saturation; it should now be correct. If your previously-edited photos look overly saturated on the new, calibrated monitor, it's because you (or your camera) punched the saturation up to compensate for the poorer capabilities of the old display. You might want to go back and recheck your best photos, to see if their adjustments should be dialed back a bit. It's happened to me, too.</p>

Among other things, it gives a very reasonable description on the predictors for fog (and other meteorological events).  It describes 4 kinds of fog and when each may/will occur:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Radiation Fog</strong>: ""On clear nights, with relatively little to no wind present, radiation fog may develop. Usually, it forms in low-lying areas like mountain valleys. This type of fog occurs when the ground cools rapidly due to terrestrial radiation, and the surrounding air temperature reaches its dew point. As the sun rises and the temperature increases, radiation fog lifts and eventually burns off""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advection Fog</strong>: ""When a layer of warm, moist air moves over a cold surface, advection fog is likely to occur. Unlike radiation fog, wind is required to form advection fog. Winds of up to 15 knots allow the fog to form and intensify. Advection fog is common in coastal areas where sea breezes can blow the air over cooler landmasses.""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upslope Fog</strong>: ""...occurs when moist, stable air is forced up sloping 
land features like a mountain range. This type of fog also requires wind for formation and continued existence. Upslope and advection fog, unlike radiation fog, may not burn off with the morning sun, but instead can persist for days. They can also extend to greater heights than radiation fog.""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Steam Fog</strong> (my favorite): ""(AKA Sea Smoke) forms when cold, dry air moves over warm water. As the water evaporates, it rises and resembles smoke. This type of fog is common over bodies of water during the coldest times of the year. Low-level turbulence and icing are commonly associated with steam fog""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I really liked how they've given you the tools to predict when fog will occur, it all makes a lot of sense.

<h2>TL;DR answer</h2>

<p>In general, Canon DSLRs require a maximum aperture of at least f/5.6 or wider to autofocus, although EOS-1 series cameras and certain newer models (including the EOS 5D Mark III, EOS 7D Mark II, and EOS 80D; essentially, any model with an AF sensor that has 45 or more points) are capable of focusing at f/8 with the center focus point. Depending on the camera model, and with some exceptions, a maximum aperture at least f/2.8 or f/4 or wider enables cross-type and/or high-precision focusing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>horizontal-sensitive point</strong> or <strong>vertical-sensitive point</strong> is an autofocus point that can detect horizontal or vertical lines, respectively. A horizontal-sensitive point cannot detect vertical lines, and a vertical-sensitive point cannot detect horizontal lines.</li>
<li>A <strong>single-line point</strong> is a horizontal-sensitive point or a vertical-sensitive point.</li>
<li>A <strong>high-precision sensor</strong> is an autofocus sensor that is capable of focusing within 1/3 of the depth of field of the lens, instead of simply within the depth of field. These sensors require faster maximum apertures, typically f/2.8 or wider, in order for them to work.</li>
<li>A <strong>cross-type point</strong> is an autofocus point that can detect both horizontal and vertical lines simultaneously. Cross-type points are actually two single-line points superimposed over one another at a 90 degree angle. Depending on the camera model, the maximum aperture may need to be at least as wide as f/2.8 or f/4 for a point to be cross-type, because the vertical-sensitive part of the AF point may be a high-precision sensor.</li>
<li>A <strong>dual cross-type point</strong> is an autofocus point that can detect diagonal lines as well as horizontal and vertical lines. Dual cross-type points are a cross-type point superimposed over another cross type point at a 45 degree angle. The diagonal sensors require an f/2.8 or wider lens in order to function because they are high-precision sensors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important notes</h3>

<p>Where ""autofocus does not function"" is noted, phase-detection autofocus is normally impossible, either when shooting through the viewfinder or with the Quick AF mode in Live View, but it is generally possible to autofocus using the contrast detection-based Live AF and Face Detection Live AF modes in Live View.</p>

<p>In addition, when an extender (teleconverter) is being used and the resulting aperture is less than what is normally required for AF, it may be possible to enable AF by taping the three extender-specific pins (which are opposite of the raised pins) on the lens side of the extender to prevent it from communicating extender information with the lens and camera, so that the camera sees the lens's aperture as though no extender is attached. This is not guaranteed to succeed as the AF system is not designed to operate under these conditions, and the Exif data will not reflect the use of the extender. Some third-party extenders may not communicate extender information with the lens and camera at all, with the same effect as the aforementioned ""tape trick"".</p>

<p>The limitations discussed hereafter generally do not apply to third-party zoom lenses that have maximum apertures of f/6.3 at the long end of the zoom range, as they actually report a maximum aperture of f/5.6 to the camera. Note, though, that faster third-party lenses should be able to autofocus as expected for their aperture, including any high-precision focusing capability normally supported by the lens and body.</p>

"Where does the DSC file name prefix come from?","30713","","<p>Without having a real problem with this, why did Nikon (maybe others too?) chose this file name prefix?</p>
","<p><strong>CIPA (the Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association) has long established DSC as meaning <em>Digital Still Camera.</em></strong> This prefix is not mandated by the DCF (Digital Camera Filesystem) standard but was adopted uniformly by Nikon and Fuji which named their files starting with DSC_, DSCN, or DSCF. Other manufactures went with PICT, PIC or P which presumable all stand for <em>Picture</em>. Although plenty of cameras also save videos with the same convention.</p>

<p>You will notice that DCF requires files in AdobeRBG color-space to start with an underscore, in which case DSC is often all that is left and you get _DSCxxxx.yyy uniformly for Nikon and Fuji.</p>

<p><em>As ahockley pointed-out, Sony coincidentally uses the DSC prefix for fixed-lens camera names as well.</em></p>

"How does using a 2x teleconverter with 70-200 f/2.8 affect use?","30699","","<p>I recently acquired the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM lens and I love it. However the other weekend I went to Heathrow to do some aviation photography. Whilst it is great for aircraft near to you, for those further away it just needs that little bit more reach!</p>

<p>So I was thinking to get a 1.4x or 2x teleconverter.  Probably one of the newest Canon mk III ones.</p>

<p>My camera body is the Canon 5D Mk III.  </p>

<p>I know that I'll lose 1 stop of light (therefore making the lens a max f/4 aperture) with the 1.4x tele, and 2 stops (so, f/5.6) with the 2x... However this doesn't bother me too much as in this situation, I'm shooting at f/7.1 and above for a decent depth of field anyway.</p>

<p>I've heard that using teleconverters can slow down AF - important when tracking aircraft on approach - but would the 5D mk III with it's 61pt AF system be so compromised, bearing in mind I'm using AI Servo mode in this case.  Also, what about image sharpness and clarity?  Many seem to agree the corners will lose sharpness but what about the main area of the frame?</p>

<p>Basically I'm trying to investigate to see whether getting a 2x teleconverter (thus making my lens capable of up to 400mm at f/5.6) is worth it, or if the cons outweigh the pros.</p>
","<p>I have used the exact setup you are using.  I found that the 2X Teleconverter iii worked wonderfully with the 70-200 f/2.8 IS II on the 5D Mark iii.  I actually tested it in far harder conditions (shooting a wedding in a relatively dimly lit gymnasium) and it worked quite well.  Particularly since you will be using the shorter focus distance setting, I wouldn't expect too much problem.</p>

<p>The focus was slower, but not significantly enough that I'd worry about it, even for your use case.  Image sharpness was still pristine.  It was certainly lower than without the converter, but more than usable.  It was far higher quality than my 70-300 f/4-5.6 IS that I was using prior to getting my 70-200 f/2.8 IS II.  The consensus here is quite correct, there is a little (but liveable) corner loss, but the center is very clear still.</p>

<p>That said, if you are willing to spend more, the 100-400 f/4L will beat the 70-200 f/2.8 IS II with 2x teleconverter in terms of quality and speed, but it also costs 3 times as much.</p>

<p>For $450 the teleconverter is a great thing to have in your bag of tricks to go with your 70-200 f/2.8 IS II, particularly for the type of shooting you are doing.  In fact, the 70-200 f/2.8 II is one of the few zoom lenses I'd recommend the 2x III for because it is so clear.  I have to admit I have not purchased one yet, but only because I don't shoot at ranges where I need it often enough and have more pressing upgrades for my kit.  Both the 1.4x III and the 2.0x III are on my list of things to get eventually.</p>

"70-300 vs 55-200 for a Nikon D3200","30540","","<p>I own a Nikon 18-55 VR and a v 55-200 (no VR). I love zooming as much as I can, but I have a very limited budget. I am not a professional, so I am learning through experimenting with my camera. </p>

<p>An idea crossed my mind, to sell the 55-200 and buy a 70-300 one instead, either Sigma or Tamron which are both low-budget lenses. Would switching make sense? I mean, I do not know how much zoom is 200m or 300mm, like the compact cameras which appear to have 3x or 10x zoom. </p>

<p>So is the no VR/VC Sigma or Tamron 70-300mm lens any good compared to the Nikon 55-200 ? </p>
","<p>I would also highly recommend considering optical image stabilization in your lens selection.  It will make a bigger difference than lens quality or maximum focal length in the quality of your images unless you are using a tripod.  On a 1.5 crop body, 200mm is the equivalent of 300mm on a full frame, and that is a fairly long zoom.  300 would be the equivalent of 450 which is extremely long (like able to make out people with a fair level of detail almost a mile away if they have sufficient resolution).</p>

<p>As far as a comparison to a 10x zoom, 10x is a useless measure.  Without a base focal length, it could be a wide angle lens with almost no range (say 1.5mm to 15mm) and even with a major crop factor, it would still only be like an 8mm to 75mm lens on a 35mm which is wide angle to standard zoom.</p>

<p>The bigger concern I see with your situation is losing the 55-70mm range.  That's a fairly key range that is equivalent to the 75 to 105mm range in 35mm lenses.  That range is the prime head and shoulders portrait range.  Perhaps you don't have a need for that range with what you shoot, but I'd play around a bit with seeing what you'd be losing if you couldn't cover that range.</p>

<p>Overall I think you'd be better served with a 55-200 that has VR though if the only options are either add VR to your current lens or extend your focal length range and still not have VR.  It simply has more practical value in resolving a telephoto image. (sharp and less zoom is better than blurry and more zoom.)</p>

"What is ""angle of view"" in photography?","30520","","<p>I read on the <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/guide_lens_basics.php"">Lens Buying Guide @ neocamera</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focal-length determines the angle-of-view seen through a lens for a
  given sensor-size. With a full-frame sensor a lens gives the same
  angle-of-view as it would on a 35mm film camera. With a smaller
  sensor, the angle-of-view becomes smaller. The crop-factor, also
  called FLM, is the ratio representing the difference in equivalent
  focal-lengths. So a 150mm on a full-frame DSLR such as the Nikon D700
  gives the same angle-of-view as a 100mm on a D7000 since its FLM is
  1.5X.</p>
  
  <p>Short focal-lengths show a greater angle-of-view compared to longer
  ones. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In layman's terms, what is angle-of-view? Is it the same as focal length?
If not, how is it different? How is it used? Why do I need to know about it?</p>
","<p>In layman's terms (assuming a layman who knows some very basic geometry), imagine your nose as the point of a triangle. The left side of the triangle is the left edge of your peripheral vision, and the right side is the right edge. <strong>The horizontal angle of view is simply the angle between those edges, and the vertical angle of view is the same thing for up and down.</strong></p>

<p>For a human eye, the angle of view happens to be about 95°, but since your eyes move around unconsciously and your brain fills in the details, it feels much wider than that.</p>

<p><strong>The terms field of view and angle of view are basically interchangeable — angle of view is one way of measuring the field of view.</strong> (One could also say something like ""10 meters at 20 meters away""... this describes different aspects of the same geometry, and with basic trig one can figure out one thing from the other.)</p>

<p>As the text you've quoted says, ""Focal-length determines the angle-of-view seen through a lens for a given sensor-size."" <strong>This is also basic trig, and you can actually plot it out on a piece of paper and measure for yourself.</strong> Obviously with a lens this is a three-dimensional problem, but we can just consider the horizontal dimension and reduce it to two. (Imagine this as a top-down cut-away view of the world.)</p>

<p>Draw a line 23.6mm long — the width of the sensor in your D7000 (and many similar cameras) — in the center at the bottom of a blank piece of paper.</p>

<p><strong>You can just look at the images I've made below, but if you're a hands-on learner like I am, it's really useful to actually get out some real paper, colored pencils, and a ruler, and follow along in the physical world.</strong></p>

<p>From the center of that line, draw a light
   perpendicular line out from that
   center dot out towards the middle of
   the page, so you have an inverted T shape. (This is for
   convenience. Think of it as ""the line towards what you're pointing the camera at"".)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rf6oe.png"" alt=""Step 1 + Step 2: aps-c sensor with perpendicular guide line""></p>

<p>Measure from your sensor along the center line you just drew. Put a dot at 35mm. Label this ""35mm lens"". This represents the pinhole aperture of an idealized 35mm lens.</p>

<p>Now measure from your sensor along the center line. Put a dot at 50mm. Label this ""50mm lens"". (And of course this represents the pinhole aperture of an idealized 50mm lens.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3oRrx.png"" alt=""Step 3 + Step 4: dots for lenses""></p>

<p>With your straightedge, draw a line from the left edge of your sensor line through the 35mm aperture dot, and continue all the way through and on to the edge of the page. Then do the same thing from the right edge of the sensor line. This should produce a big <code>X</code> shape. Label both lines of the top cone of the X ""35mm field of view"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PonRf.png"" alt=""Step 5: APS-C angle of view with a 35mm lens""></p>

<p>Do the same thing with the 50mm lens dot. Label this, of course, ""50mm field of view"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z67bn.png"" alt=""Step 6: APS-C angle of view with a 50mm lens""></p>

<p>Now, you can directly see that a shorter focal length produces a wider field of view. Anything that's within those lines will be in your picture, and everything outside will be out of frame. Note that the lens may project a much wider cone of light that doesn't all fall on the sensor — the lines you drew ignore that, since <strong>light that isn't recorded doesn't really matter</strong>.</p>

<p>If you measure the angle, you should see that it's about 36.5° for the 35mm lens, and about 26° for the 50mm lens.</p>

<p>Then, two further experiments:</p>

<p>Experiment one: Choose some different focal lengths (15mm, 200mm) and see what those give you.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z69Qc.png"" alt=""Step 8: a 15mm lens""></p>

<p>Experiment 2: Increase the size of the sensor line to 36mm, as in Nikon's ""FX"" full-frame cameras. Keep the line centered on the same dot, of course. Use your <em>same</em> lens dots but draw new X lines to the larger left and right edge of the sensor. <strong>It's immediately apparent that including this extra part of the light cone makes the <em>recorded</em> field of view of the same focal length much wider.</strong></p>

<p>Notice that the 35mm on your D7000 gives roughly the field of view of the 50mm on FX — this is why people talk about ""equivalent"" lenses.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H2RVE.png"" alt=""Step 10: Full-frame""></p>

<p>You can see that the lines for APS-C 35mm and ""Full-Frame"" 50mm aren't right on top of each other, as one might expect for an ""equivalent"". That's because this breaks down a bit at macro distance. If you move back a few millimeters, it'll line up correctly (but change perspective ever so slightly). The lines are roughly parallel, though, so those few millimeters are still just a few millimeters across the room, where they're inconsequential. If you draw this on a really big piece of paper instead of this little on-screen one, that'll become clear. (And of course, they're not exactly parallel, because the lenses don't quite match the crop factor — 32.7777...mm and 50mm would be more exact. Ah, the real world, always getting in the way of explaining things simply. Other real-world factors apply as well; for example, focal length changes with focus distance, and also the focal length written on a lens is often rounded to a nice-looking number.)</p>

<p>This neatly (I hope) answers the question of the relationship between focal length and angle of view / field of view, and also explains the effect of different sensor sizes — and, as a bonus, shows how cropping is interchangeable with zooming (if you don't mind using less of your sensor).</p>

"Are there disadvantages using an FX lens on a DX Camera?","30506","","<p>I have a set of FX Lenses for my 35mm SLR, but also a DX Digital SLR. The FX lenses work fine, so I wonder if there is any point buying a DX Lens?</p>

","<blockquote>

<p>Yes there are several points. Because the image circle for a DX is smaller <strong>there exist DX lenses which doesn't have counterparts in FX lineup</strong>. </p>

<p>Just two examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>the famous Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 DC HSM (no Full Frame zoom with f/1.8 exist)</li>
<li>the new super-super-zoom Tamron 16-300MM F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD (an equivalent of approx. 25-456mm (!) on Full Frame). And this beast includes also image stabilizer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also DX lenses are <strong>smaller, easier and cheaper</strong> (for example Sigma 8-16mm costs $650 whereas the FX brother - Sigma 12-24mm - costs $950).</p>

<p>However, generally I do recommend you to use FX lenses. Usually (not always, but generally speaking) they are better optically on DX sensors and allow you to upgrade to a Full Frame (FX) sensor in future.</p>

<li>Please ask just one question per question. :) Thank you.</li>
<li>No. 50mm is 50mm. The focal length is a property of the lens. It has nothing to do with the dimensions of the sensor on which the 'field of vision' (as you say) is formed. The 'field of vision' depends on the <strong>relationship between the focal length and the dimensions of sensor</strong> (given that the sensors are at the same distance from lens). That's why we have focal length Full Frame equivalences. For these equivalences, see a calculator <a href=""http://www.digified.net/focallength/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>my 50mm FX Lens is like a ~35mm Lens in terms of visible space</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IIUC, No (again). Because your sensor is a crop one, the lens will be 'longer' (narrower/""cropped"" field of view) not 'wider'. Your 50mm lens will be 50 x 1.52 (the common Nikon crop factor) = 76mm = short tele. </p>

"How do I properly do shadowless product photos?","30482","","<p>My friend asked me to create a photo like this:</p>

<p>I noticed that its shadowless and my first question is whether it was setup to be shadowless, or was it made shadowless in post? How many lights are involved here? I think there's one for the background, and one above the product pointing something like 30 degrees down, and then some reflectors to the side. Just guessing. </p>

<p>I did some Googling and came across <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/pongky/4332533627/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this setup</a>. How could that be shadowless? Looks like the product is a few feet above the ground, which is a white seamless background, and the camera and all the lighting are all pointing down. How could there be no shadow on the ground?</p>

"How to capture detail of craters on the moon?","29633","","<p>How can I photograph the moon so that I see detail of the craters and mountains? </p>

<p>I have a Canon EOS 550D (T2i) and tried ""No Flash"", ""P"" as well as creative auto mode, but to no avail. Every time I get a completely white moon.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/bD5wQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Moon Shot</a></p>
","<p>I had exactly the same problem when I first tried to photograph the moon: all I ever got was an overexposed white circle.</p>

<p>The answer is that the moon is <strong><em>much</em> brighter</strong> than you realise. Also, unless you have a very telescopic lens, it's going to be pretty small in your photo. If you use one of the camera's automatic modes, the camera will try to get the ""right"" exposure for a scene made up of lots of black sky and a tiny bit of moon. The ""lots of black sky"" wins out, the camera brightens the exposure, and you lose the detail in the moon.</p>

<p>The best way to capture the moon is therefore to <strong>use Manual mode</strong>. This isn't as difficult as it sounds:</p>

<ol>
<li>Switch the mode dial to M.</li>
<li>Set the ISO setting to something quite low: between 100 and 400 should do it.</li>
<li>Set your aperture setting to somewhere round f/5.6.</li>
<li>Set your shutter speed to around 1/100s.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now try a shot and see how it looks. If it's too bright, try a faster shutter speed until you start to see the detail of the craters. If you've somehow <em>under</em>-exposed it, just do the opposite: try a slower shutter speed, a larger aperture or a higher ISO setting.</p>

<p>The main thing is <strong>ignore what the camera is telling you!</strong> It'll be flashing away like crazy saying your shot is going to be too dark, but just ignore it. We <em>know</em> the sky will be ""too dark"", but it's the moon we're after. Fold away your targeting computer, Luke. Use the Force.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"What are the best techniques for photographing overweight people?","29620","","<p>I'm not the most lean person on the planet, and many pictures seem to really point this out.  While I wish I was simply in better shape,  it is simply not the case for me or unfortunately, many people.</p>

<p>Are there poses, lighting techniques, focal lengths, etc. that will work better to reduce some of the common overweight features (large stomach, double chin, etc.)?  </p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
Ok, so I incorporated a few of the suggestions that I could into a self portrait in the limited space I have.  I didn't have suitable room or patience for a three-quarters shot, so here's just a headshot.  Some of the suggestions really, <em>really</em> made a noticeable difference.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Second Update:  So here's another shot that takes into account a few more of the suggestions yet (including Jay's suggestion of slightly rotating the light a bit more).  The only thing I think I'd additionally do is make sure to where a higher collared shirt to help hide neck rolls.  Also, I found straightening my back fairly rigidly helped a lot.</p>

<p>And in finale, here's a before picture of how bad it could look. This was taken about 30-40 pounds <em>lighter</em>, by another photographer. (This is a lowres crop, unfortunately.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vkPdQ.jpg"" alt=""&quot;before&quot;""></p>
","<p>Not an odd question at all. As a large man myself, I constantly find myself on the lookout for ways in my portrait business to help people look their best (no particular order... just as they came to mind):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6495/in-portrait-photography-what-is-broad-lighting-what-is-short-lighting"">broad lighting</a>.</strong> This is a 'basic' for portrait lighting, but I'm always amazed when I see inexperienced photographers who simply throw light all over the place and don't seem to understand that broad lighting makes faces rounder and short lighting 'sculpts' the face...</li>
<li><strong>Rotate the subject 45-degrees to the camera.</strong> This, in combination with short lighting can dramatically de-emphasize a person's size.</li>
<li><strong>If the subject is sitting have them lean forward.</strong> I always tell subjects to 'lean over their belt buckle.' This naturally de-emphasizes the belly, and provides elongation of the neck without specifically asking a subject to stretch their neck (that often causes subjects to <em>really</em> stretch, which always ends up looking awkward).</li>
<li><strong>Arrange the legs.</strong> There's a whole 'science' to positioning legs, but one of the most basic things to do for female clients is have them place one foot in front of the other, put all the weight on their back foot, bend both knees slightly and rotate one hip towards the camera. (Check out any picture of a female celeb on the red carpet to see this in action... They all do it. Good for you paying attention during media training, celebs!)</li>
<li><strong>Hide the gut.</strong> Portrait photography has a long tradition of putting the more... rotund... subject behind something to hide the belly. Whether it's another subject (""All them kids are finally good for something!"" Actual customer quote during a session of mine. All in good fun, of course... I hope.), or an actual object. Get creative.</li>
<li><strong>Hide the gut, Part 2.</strong> Lay the subject down. Great/easy way to hide a multitude of problems.</li>
<li><strong>The ol' vignette.</strong> I find the vignette is a great post-production tool for directing the eye towards the most important part of the picture- the face.</li>
<li><strong>The liquify tool.</strong> If you're a Photoshop user, the Liquify tool can be great for shrinking muffin-tops, saggy arms, etc. Plenty of 'sin' is committed with the over-use of Liquify, but used subtly it can be a great addition to the toolbox.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness favors the big subject.</strong> I'm generally very hesitant to light a subject high-key if they're big... Unless the bigness is the point of the picture (A.K.A. you're photographing a pregnant lady, or a sumo warrior). Dark backgrounds and purposeful shadows can have a surprisingly large (har har) slimming effect.</li>
<li><strong>Use the group to your advantage.</strong> If you have a mixed group of 'average sized' people and 'bigger folk,' position the bigger people farther from the camera than everyone else... Instantly they will appear smaller. It's surprising how far back in the picture you can place people without it being obvious that they're farther back in the frame. Not such a great technique if your subject is big, but short, however. BONUS: This also works great if you need to shorten up a really tall person in a group photo. :-)</li>
<li><strong>Lens choice.</strong> Generally speaking focal lengths between 50mm and 85mm will give you the least amount of 'unexpected body part distortion' when taking pictures.</li>
<li><strong>The clothes make the woman, or man.</strong> In addition to the 'standard advice' you often hear about reminding clients not to wear horizontal stripes, wearing darker clothing, etc., many bigger people respond to being uncomfortable with their size or with being photographed by choosing to wear bigger/baggier outfits for the photo session. Typically this only serves to make them look even bigger in photographs... It is far better to recommend that someone wear properly fitted clothing (even if that means seeing a tailor to help) than to have to work around the fact that the client now looks even bigger because of their tent-like outfit.</li>
<li><strong>Get A Little Closer. Don't Be Shy.</strong> Try really pushing into the subject. Often times the most interesting shots are a bit 'closer than is comfortable,' and leaving things out of frame can 'cover over a multitude of sins' without having to use any additional techniques. </li>
<li><strong>Focus, Focus.</strong> Try widening the camera's aperture. An f-stop down in the 2s can help you make a portrait with a more selective focal point (which in portrait photography should almost always be the eyes) and as everything else is more out of focus the viewers attention will be drawn back to the important/in-focus parts, and away from the unimportant/out-of-focus parts.</li>
<li><strong>Posture-perfect.</strong> While not exclusively the domain of bigger folks, poor posture is something that a lot of bigger folks struggle with. A slouch can add apparent weight to a subject as it can make the stomach protrude even farther, so have the subject straighten their back, and also pull their shoulders back as well.</li>

"What is flat light and how to counter that?","29429","","<p>I have often heard people saying that the light in the picture X is appearing ""flat"". I want to understand what exactly does that mean, and what are the possible ways to counter that?</p>
","<p>Flat lighting is when a scene, regardless of its type, is largely and broadly ""diffusely and directly lit"". Flat lighting illuminates the scene, however it does not bring out depth and detail, or add any intriguing character. In some rarer/specific cases, you may require flat lighting, depending on the exact goals you have. In general, however, flat lighting makes a photo look rather dull and lifeless.</p>

<p>With nature photography, flat lighting is often caused by overcast skies, direct sunlight, etc. Landscape photos in particular generally look best when the sun is at a low, indirect angle such that the shape of mountains cast shadows upon themselves, bringing to light that shape and providing depth. Early morning sunrise or evening sunset light is good for this reason, as well as for the fact that such light is often more colorful and vibrant than midday sunlight.</p>

<p>With portrait photography, flat lighting dulls or eliminates the intriguing features of your subjects that give them their character, expression, emotion. Highly diffused, direct lighting can be a useful tool for portraits, however uses as the only source of lighting it can produce rather boring portraits. More complex, angled lighting can do wonders for portrait photography. Use of sunlight or artificial lighting, angling your subjects to light sources, providing adequate and appropriate fill lighting, etc. can greatly enhance the character and emotion of your subjects. I would search our forum for other questions of portrait and studio lighting...there are many skilled photographers here who have provided superb answers detailing specific kinds of lighting setups for portrait photography that go into far greater depth than I ever could here. </p>

"How to apply color management to the Windows 7 mouse cursor?","29392","","<p>I have been using the Sypder 3 colorimiter and Datacolor Spyder3Elite software to calibrate my screen for several years now. The Sypder3 does wonders, and really improves the quality of my on-screen color representation. </p>

<p>There is one little annoyance, however, and I am curious if anyone else has encountered this. I calibrate my screen to a D50 white point (5000k), as it more closely matches the fine art papers I most often print on. The windows mouse cursor, however, is a very stark, bright white with a tinge of blue (7300k or so), like a glossy photo paper with copious amounts of optical brightener. I'm a little confused as to why my mouse cursor doesn't follow the white point of my monitor's color profile. </p>

<p>Has anyone else encountered this? Is there a way to fix it? </p>

<p>OS: Windows 7 Ultimate</p>
","<p>This has bothered me for years, especially on laptop screens that have no hardware calibration option. Here's an instant fix:</p>

<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse]
""MouseTrails""=""-1""
</code></pre>

<p>Save that as a .reg, merge it and then Log Off/On.</p>

<p>With mouse trails enabled windows uses a different render for the cursor which in turn applies the color correction.  The original problem is that the ICC profile was not being applied to the mouse cursor and was causing it to ""stand out"" (read the first post again). With this setting, the profile <em>will</em> be applied.</p>

<p>Setting <code>HKCU\Control Panel\Mouse\MouseTrails</code> to -1 turns on mouse trails but sets the trail length to zero.  The -1 works on Windows 7 with Nvidia drivers; I have not tested it with other OS/Video combinations.</p>

<p>Possible values for the setting include:</p>

<pre><code>-1 = A buggy setting that seems to enable the cursor trail render but has no actual trails
0  = Off
1  = Also equals off
2  = Lowest you can actually set the trail length in the control panel
10 = Default length

"How does the dynamic range of the human eye compare to that of digital cameras?","29354","","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/Cameras/Camera-Sensor-Ratings/%28type%29/usecase_landscape"" rel=""noreferrer"">DxO tests</a>, cameras have 10 to 12 stops of dynamic range.

<p>Also <a href=""http://www.normankoren.com/digital_tonality.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Norman Koren says</a> that a digital camera's original dynamic range can be 9 to 11 stops, but prints have ""only"" 6.5 stops.</p>

<p>In a section on dynamic range, Wikipedia says the human eye has a contrast ratio of around <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye#Dynamic_range"" rel=""noreferrer"">6.5 stops</a>. If that is the case, why is the human eye clearly much better than cameras to record scenes with high dynamic range?</p>
","<p>This is a very good question, and the answer could fill hundreds of pages - and, in fact, the answer already DOES fill hundreds of pages. </p>

<p>The short answer is that the figures you are citing to not agree with apparent reality because the commonly quoted figures are wrong :-). Read on ...</p>

<p>Much is available on the internet on this subject and the quality is, as ever, widely variable. There is also a  lot of parroting of ""facts"" between sites and figures like those in Wikipedia seem common enough BUT there are some very reasoned arguments which seem to suggest that the Wikipedia figure is extremely wrong and underestimates the figure very substantially.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the eye acts as a contrast detector rather than an absolute level detector (such as a digital camera sensor uses) so comparisons need care.</p>

<p>With irising, chemical adaptation and every other trick it can pull it seems that the absolute dynamic range of the whole eye system is well over 20 stops. As each stop is a factor of 2, that's 2^20 or about ""well over 1,000,000:1"". At the top end, the sun is too bright!!!. At the bottom end the dark adapted eye can detect a single photon. A D3S (better performance than a D4) may have trouble with that. (Note that that is not EVERY photon - when you get down to the few  photons per second level a lot of them will hit non-sensor areas and not be detected. But when one DOES strike a sensitive retina area it will produce a signal that can be recorded.)</p>

<p>But, I digress :-). An extremely good (it seems) page that discusses eye dynamic range and more is</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Notes on the Resolution and Other Details of the Human Eye</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Paragraph headings are worth noting:</p>

<p>Notes on the Resolution of the Human Eye<br>
 Visual Acuity and Resolving Detail on Prints<br>
 How many megapixels equivalent does the eye have?<br>
 The Sensitivity of the Human Eye (ISO Equivalent)<br>
 The Dynamic Range of the Eye<br>
 The Focal Length of the Eye  </p>

<p>The writer argues that the dynamic range of the eye without changing sensitivity by adaptation or irising is about 1,000,000:1 in low light conditions. That is, as great as the ""well over"" lower limit mentioned above. Then he justifies this claim as copied below. This sounds fairly convincing at first glance. There may be flaws in the argument, but it seems OK, and this does not mean that it applies in all light levels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a simple experiment you can do. Go out with a star chart on a clear night with a full moon. Wait a few minutes for your eyes to adjust. Now find the faintest stars you can detect when the you can see the full moon in your field of view. Try and limit the moon and stars to within about 45 degrees of straight up (the zenith).   </p>
  
  <p>If you have clear skies away from city lights, you will probably be able to see magnitude 3 stars.   </p>
  
  <p>The full moon has a stellar magnitude of -12.5.   </p>
  
  <p>If you can see magnitude 2.5 stars, the magnitude range you are seeing is 15.   </p>
  
  <p>Every 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100, so 15 is 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000.   </p>
  
  <p>Thus, the dynamic range in this relatively low light condition is about 1 million to one, perhaps higher!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, here's a suggestion from me for an experiment at normal daylight light levels. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Find a scene that has  a good mixture of dark areas and very bright areas - ideally with some dark areas as isolated islands near islands of brightness. An example may be sunlight shining through trees into a heavily shaded area - a few caelets or deeply shaded areas will help.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow your eyes to adapt to the general lighting level - do not stare at the bright spots near where the sun is shining through and do not focus on any especially dark areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Note how well you can see detail in the darkest of dark areas - at what level of darkness does is fade to black.  </p></li>
<li><p>Try the same with bright areas -  as you look toward the sun there will be a place where details washes out and you cannot reasonably see more.</p></li>
<li><p>Cast your eyes to and fro across the scene between dark and light to try to stop your adaptation mechanism changing f-stop on you. </p></li>
<li><p>Now, take photos of the scene. Expose ""correctly"" and then so the darkest areas that you could see can be seen in the photo and then so that the brightest highlights you could distinguish are not washed out.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have the equipment, take an HDR photo with maximum f-stop variation between photos. (My Sony A77 allows 5ev steps.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My experience is that my eye can always see a wider brightness range than my camera (Minolta 7Hi, A200, 5D, 7D,  A700, A77, other)</p>

<p>On  maximum HDR image (10 ev range between centres) my eye can see as well as or better than  the camera. </p>

<p>The area where this does not APPEAR to be so is in extremely low light when I may need to allow the eye to integrate (which it does for up to about 4 seconds!) whereas I can look at a low light photo and see the image immediately. The fact that I may have needed a 10 second exposure is then irrelevant for viewing.</p>

"How can I get the shutter actuation count for Canon EOS 600D (Rebel T3i)?","29193","","<p>How can I view the shutter count on an EOS 600D? The EOSInfo software doesn't work for me.</p>
","<p>The shutter count is not included in the EXIF information of images made using EOS cameras such as is the case with some cameras from some other manufacturers. So online solutions where the user uploads a photo from the camera in question or other methods dependent upon a ""shutter count"" field in the EXIF info do not work with EOS camera.</p>

<p>The shutter count from EOS cameras with DiG!C III and later processors up to cameras released by the end of 2014 make the shutter count available through the remote controlled interface that may be accessed on the camera via a USB connection. The remote control interface may also be accessed via WiFi connection for cameras so equipped with WiFi capability. This includes all DiG!C III, DiG!C 4, and DiG!C 5/5+ cameras. The EOS 7D Mark II is the only DiG!C 6/6+ camera that allows shutter count access via the remote controlled interface. None of the models released since early 2015 with DiG!C 6/6+ or later processors allow the shutter count to be accessed without the proprietary tools used by Canon service centers. For more detailed information about specific models, please see <a href=""http://www.direstudio.com/shuttercount/tech-specs/#incompatible-cameras"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a> at <a href=""http://www.direstudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dire studio's website</a>.</p>

<p>Your EOS Rebel T3i/600D falls into the group that allows the remote control application to access the camera's shutter count <em>for still images taken with the camera</em>. Live View actuations are not reported via the remote control interface. Only the Canon service centers can extract that info from EOS cameras.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Dire Studios offers an app called <a href=""http://www.direstudio.com/shuttercount/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ShutterCount</a> that works with compatible Canon EOS cameras listed above. Although it is not free, the cost is very modest. As of December 1, 2016 the <a href=""http://www.laszlopusztai.net/2015/11/23/shuttercount-for-windows-price-increase/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows version</a> is $3.99 USD and all other versions are $2.99 USD. I've been using it for about a year and a half and am very happy with it.</p>

<p>Prior to buying ShutterCount I was using a free app called EOSInfo. However, there are some security concerns floating around the internet about that program's developer so I chose to stop using it.</p>

<p>You can also access the internal shutter count on certain EOS cameras using Magic Lantern. To use <a href=""http://www.magiclantern.fm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Magic Lantern</a> to access the shutter count you must have one of the cameras listed above for which there is also a version of Magic Lantern available. The original version of magic Lantern was developed for the EOS 5D Mark II and is perhaps the most stable version of ML there is. Since ML is third party software there is <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/26695/what-are-the-risks-of-using-magic-lantern"">some risk</a> in using it.</p>

"Do fluorescent lighting and shutter speed create a problem with color cast?","29154","","<p>I took a bunch of photos at my son's martial arts club using a D90 with a 50mm F1.8.  The club is lit with overhead fluorescent lighting, and I was getting some weird results where some shots are ""white"", others have an ""orange cast"", and still others are partly white and partly orange in the same shot.</p>

<p>I suspect it has to do with the combination of the frequency of the light flicker and with the camera shutter speed. Here is a sequence of 3 shots that show the problem.  The shots were taken with 1/500s at F2 and ISO-800 and with Auto-WB.</p>

<p>First shot (""white/normal""):

<p>Third shot (""orange cast"" at bottom):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vToOD.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>These were taken in burst mode within a second of each other.</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me what is going on?  And, how I can avoid this?</p>
","<p>Fluorescent lights can flicker at twice the frequency of the current feeding them, which implies an entire cycle of the flicker will take between 1/100 and 1/120 second.  During each cycle the light's intensity and its color temperature can change.  Thus, if you're using a shutter speed of 1/100 second or faster, you might observe exactly these phenomena: your photos make an interesting document of them, especially the bottom photo.</p>

<p>Details appear deep within a good <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on fluorescent lamps</a> under the heading ""Flicker Problems"".  The article references ""<a href=""http://blog.tommyimages.com/2009/06/photographing-under-fluorescent-lights.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Feral Photographer</a>"" blog which gives a brief (simplified) explanation from a digital photographer's perspective.</p>

<p>For sports photography indoors you need a short exposure time to freeze the action.  Consider flash options if they are possible.  Very short exposures (down to 1/4000 second typically) can be achieved with HSS flashes.  To an extent you can adjust the color balance, especially when you're shooting RAW images, but that's going to be tricky during the color transition.</p>

"Best image quality non-prime walk around lens for travelling with a Canon crop dSLR?","29063","","<p>If money where no object what is the best quality non-prime walk around lens to pair with a crop sensor Canon dSLR for travelling?</p>

<p>From what i have read so far a lot of people recommend the Canon EF-S 15-85 IS USM, however it is not an full-frame or an L series lens, does this matter? (considering i'm looking for for the best quality lens regardless of price?)</p>

<p>I imagine this could be a generic question worth answering but if specifics are required then i am planning to get a 7D and start of with a single lens for travelling, currently i have been using a Canon S95.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Based on comments I've udpated the question to specifically ask for best image quality in a non-prime lens.</p>
","<p>I would highly recommend the <strong>EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM</strong>.  I used this on my 350D and 7D for a couple of years before selling it on.  My reason for getting rid of it was simply because I preferred primes to zooms.  The optical quality of this lens is stunning, and should be an L series lens in many peoples opinions. It has aspherical elements and coatings like the L series, though the body of the lens is not metal like an L series and is not weather sealed.  Otherwise it's great.  The fast f/2.8 aperture through the whole zoom range is also fantastic, allowing you to get some great indoor or low-light photos at lower ISO's than would otherwise be necessary.</p>

<p>In full-frame terms, 17mm is equivalent to 27mm and 55 is equivalent to 88mm, so you're getting a 27-88mm lens (equivalent) with constant f/2.8 aperture AND image stabiliser too.</p>

<p>It should be noted that EF-S lenses are designed specifically for crop sensor cameras, and I read somewhere (perhaps here) that ON a crop-sensor body, an EF-S lens would be sharper than the equivalent EF lens, which is designed with full-frame sensors in mind.  Obviously the downside of an EF-S lens is that should you decide to go full-frame in the future, you will not be able to use the EF-S lens on a full frame body. </p>

"What is a 200mm lens good for?","28844","","<p>I just found that there is a 200mm lens at my school. It is a Canon with <s>Image Stabiliser</s> (with red detail). <s>It is old, at least 10 years.</s> It has been great playing around with it, but I really don't know what it is good for. What type of photos is it built for. I recall vaguely a friend telling me that a lens with no room to change the zoom will give you better focus... but apart from that I am not sure what type of photos it is good for. I want to take it to the sports field and capture some sports in action.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The lens is a ""Canon EF 200mm 1:2.8 L II Ultrasonic"". It does <strong>not</strong> say anything about image stabaliser :(</p>
","<p>A 200mm lens is in the category of lenses called ""fixed focal length"" or ""prime"", which cannot zoom in and out.  The more common lens type is the zoom, which does allow you to zoom in and out.</p>

<p>The primary tradeoffs between prime and zoom lenses are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aperture</strong> - Typically, prime lenses tend to operate at wider maximum aperture than zooms.  For instance, Nikon makes 50mm, 85mm, and 105mm prime lenses that can expose down to an aperture of 1.4, whereas the best zoom lenses that cover that range can only focus down to 2.8.  In terms of the photo, that can be a noticeable difference in the Depth of Field, which controls how much of the image is in focus and how much is in blurred out.</li>
<li><strong>Optical quality</strong> - Prime lenses are almost universally better optically than equivalent zooms.  They achieve better sharpness by usign fewer optical elements.  You can think of this as fewer pieces of glass between you and your subject, thereby reducing the amount of distortion, letting more light through, and having more fine-tuned control of the final image.</li>
<li>weight - Prime lenses are always much lighter in weight than their zoom counterparts</li>
</ul>

<p>You asked specifically about the 200mm lens.  This lens is often used for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wildlife</strong> - When you are on safari, or birding, your subject can be as far as 50 to a few hundred yards away, and if you still want to fill the frame of your image with that subject you need a hefty zoom.  The 200mm helps accomplish that.  </li>
<li><strong>Sports</strong> - Same as in wildlife, if you are standing on the sidelines of a sports game, you need to zoom in to capture the action up close in your frame.</li>
<li><strong>Portraiture</strong> - This lens is also useful for portraiture, but it requires standing very far from your subject.  Some professionals will do this to achieve a very dramatic effect and a maximal blurring of the background.</li>
</ul>

<p>This lens is best used with a tripod or monopod because when you are zoomed out that far, even the slightest bit of camera shake will significantly impact your image.</p>

"Need suggestions on a good RAW Viewer","28833","","<p>I am a guy who mostly shoot JPEGs even though I know the benefits of shooting RAWs. Its because I'm too lazy to process the RAW files. I am newish in Photography, I shoot a lot of pics whenever I'm outside but the number of keepers are low. So after shooting maybe 500 pics I luckily pick 1/2 from them. This is my main reason for shooting JPEGs. I just keep pressing the Right/Left arrow button in Pacasa until I see a pic which I can keep.

"Do digital cameras lose picture quality over time?","28800","","<p>For some reasons when I look at my first pictures from my camera (DSLR), they look stunning. I know it could be just psychological. Another friend told me that her camera was really good when she bought it fours years ago (10 MP), but now it is just ok. I see her P&amp;S very blurry in indoors (almost like phone quality pictures).</p>

<p>A quick search yielded this <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070531200131AAxLhTp"" rel=""noreferrer"">yahoo answer</a>, which actually does not seem bad to me. That answer can be summarized as: not really, but some things make image quality worse. Listed factors include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dust accumulation on the sensor (blamed for ""resolution loss, pixels of false colors, noise, spots"")</li>
<li>Worn-out moving parts leaving the sensor out of alignment (""focus images, blurry and distorted images"")</li>
<li>Improper maintenance leading to ""blown-out receptors on the sensor"" (which lead to ""blank spots on the image, false-color pixels and resolution loss"")</li>
<li>Dust in the lens (""noisy, blurry and distorted images"")</li>
<li>Scratched or destroyed lens coating (""distortion or false colors due to ultraviolet and infrared radiation reaching the sensor"")</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any truth to it? What should I be careful for proper maintenance? </p>
","<p>Practically speaking, <strong>digital cameras do not lose quality</strong> over time.</p>

<p>Some factors can come into play such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Equipment can wear causing it to be out of spec</li>
<li>Environmental factors such as dirt, sand, dust, moisture can degrade quality</li>
<li>Heat or excessive use(causing heat) can cause all electronic devices to experience wear</li>
<li>Other regular use issues from dropping, lack of cleaning, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>But overall, these things should hardly turn a great looking 10MP point and shoot camera into a 640X480 resolution cell phone. </p>

"What are the downsides to framing without glass over the print?","28795","","<p>I hate seeing the reflections of bright lights on my framed prints. (Actually, anybody's prints!) I'm about to frame this season's work for the gallery and I'm considering leaving off the glass. I can hold a matted print in my hand and say wow, but once I put the glass on it, I also see the reflections of the room lights or windows.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the glass protects the print, but from what? I have oil paintings (but not watercolors) hanging in my house that are not covered with glass. Is a photo more fragile than a painting?</p>

<p>I don't print giclee, so I'm not worried about ink running. Shoot, I don't even know if that is a problem with giclee.</p>

<p>One obvious solution is to use the special anti-reflective glass, like <a href=""http://www.tru-vue.com/Tru-Vue/Products/33/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tru-Vue</a>, but that will increase the cost of my prints in an already down economy.</p>

<p>What issues am I facing? What other solutions are available?</p>
","<p>Oil paintings (and acrylics on canvas) are normally varnished for protection, and require periodic cleaning. (Traditionally, oils were varnished with Damar varnish, but over the past few decades a non-yellowing synthetic such as Liquitex Soluvar has become the standard; such varnishes can be removed with solvents that have little or no effect on the underlying painting. Synthetics are also available in matte formulations that don't have the problems of matte natural varnishes—they get their matte effect from waxes.) The cleaning process itself usually involves water in one way or another, which can be a problem for any water-soluble inks, dyes or grounds (such as, say, gelatine in a traditional photo emulsion).</p>

<p>Room air isn't just a collection of gasses; there are normally any number of aerosols (liquids and particles) suspended in it. If the picture is hung in a house, it's hung in a place where minute traces of every cooked meal are wandering around the place looking for a nice spot for a nap. There's vehicle exhaust, etc., wandering in off of the street. Dust abounds. Anything you've sprayed to clean or polish something else (including yourself) has overspray. There might not be anything that's visible or even particularly appreciable at any given moment, but over the years it all adds up. Eventually, your pictures will be covered in a film of <em>schmutz</em> that detracts from their appearance. So, by the way, will the matte.</p>

<p>Then there's the whole moisture moderation thing to consider. When pictures are framed properly, they form a package that significantly damps out fluctuations in the humidity of the surrounding air. Expansion and contraction (in absolute terms) depend, of course, on the size of the picture—a 20x30 inch picture on a natural paper ground will be a couple of millimeters larger overall at 90% humidity than it will be at, say 40%, while a 4x6 won't seem to change much at all. But the front of the picture is open to the environment without glass, while the back is protected by the mounting board. Even a small unglazed watercolor will begin to wrinkle visibly if it's not in a humidity-controlled environment. Depending on the ground (some papers are coated on both sides with a synthetic material that acts as a moisture barrier) you might see the same thing happening with your prints.</p>

<p>You can try alternatives, like varnishing or lamination, both of which can be had in less-glossy formulations (although I have to warn you that lamination tends to decrease the perceived ""art value"" among patrons). Neither, though, is a conservationally sound practice since they are irreversible. Whether or not that matters depends on the expectations of your patrons; are they buying pretty pictures with a limited decoration life, or are they buying heirloom works of art?</p>

<p>To sum up: there are good reason for framing works of art on paper behind glass. There are alternatives, but those alternatives also have their drawbacks. Your market; you decide.</p>

"Lightroom vs. Elements vs. Photoshop: Side-by-side comparison?","28745","","<p>I'm a bit overwhelmed by the available options in regards to the three major photo editing apps from Adobe.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of an article or site that lists the features of Lightroom, PS Elements, and PS, side by side?  I know that Lightroom revolves around edits and workflow, and that PS is the big kahuna of image editing.  Where does Elements fit in to this understanding?</p>
","<p>The three tools approximate three general levels of functionality and capability. Photoshop Elements is an entry-level image editing package. It provides image editing and some library management capabilities. It has some rich capabilities, and supports all the common editing capabilities of Photoshop. Adjustment layers allow non-destructive editing to a degree, however there are fewer adjustments possible in Elements than Photoshop. It is limited, and if you do a lot of photographic editing, you <strong>will</strong> eventually run into Elements' many limitations.</p>

<p>Photoshop Lightroom is a professional image editing package. It is specifically geared towards the digital photographer with an advanced workflow, RAW image support, and extensive library management capabilities. It is designed to expose the key tools important to editing digital photographs, such as a histogram, white balance and tone adjustments, color adjustments, detail adjustments (i.e. noise reduction and sharpening), as well as some advanced features like camera and lens profiles to correct distortion and vignetting. Lightroom also offers some rich tools that go beyond the basic on-screen editing, including print and book creation, slideshow generation, and web site publishing. New publishing modules in Lightroom 3 allow direct upload of your images and metadata to sites like Flickr and Facebook.</p>

<p>Photoshop CS is the ultimate image editing program. It is a low-level tool, giving you direct and total control over pretty much any edit you can think of. It's capabilities extend far beyond photographic editing and support artistic image creation and editing of a very wide variety. For a photographer, Photoshop brings HDR generation and editing, panoramic stitching, and a whole host of additional tools that are not available in Lightroom. Photoshop lacks some things provided by Lightroom, however, particularly its ease of use and clean workflow designed specifically to optimize a photographers image management, editing, and publishing. The most common and useful operations that need to be performed on digital photographs can be completed in much less time with Lightroom. Photoshop itself lacks any real kind of library management outside of Bridge.</p>

<p>If you do very light weight photography with only the most basic of edits, use Photoshop Elements.  </p>

<p>If you want more control and/or have a large catalog of images (more than a few thousand), or want Photoshop-level support of RAW tools, Lightroom is highly recommended.  It can act as the central tool for managing, editing, and publishing your photographic works. It has an ideal price point, making it easy to acquire. </p>

<p>Photoshop CS is a great tool to have to cover the cases where Lightroom is lacking, such as pixel-level editing or modification of your image. In previous versions Lightroom lacked the ability to soft-proof (simulate printed output on the screen) and support for ICM color profiles for various output devices, but this is no longer true.  </p>

"Did I make a mistake buying a D5100 to get started with photography?","28655","","<p>So I decided to start photography. My aim is simple: take photos of my future travels around the world. I want to take good photos.</p>

<p>Well, I made the mistake of buying the gears before even learning about it. I bought a Nikon D5100 camera, and I think it's not good but maybe it's just my skills.</p>

<p>So here it goes my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Where can I learn about gear? Things like a lens, protection and cleaning stuff...</li>
<li>Is the Nikon D5100 a good camera? The lens is ""18-55mm""</li>
<li>What are the good software for editing photos and where to learn how to use them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also any estimates of how much time this should take?</p>
","<p>I suspect you are trying to treat photography the way you would approach computer programming (your stock overflow profile indicates that you are a fairly advanced contributor on that site).  I myself started out my DSLR journey with the Canon 550D + 18-55mm kit lens combo (rough equivalents of their Nikon counterparts that you possess). The lens is quite common, and covers the range of most Point &amp; Shoot cameras. </p>

<p>Overall, you have a fairly advanced model without any limitations on the kind of images you can take. I started out shooting in the Auto and pre-programmed modes for the first couple of months before switching to the semi automatic modes (Aperture\Shutter priority modes)</p>

<p>Some points to make you feel good about your camera:</p>

<ul>
<li>Definitely not a starter model, and very good value for money</li>
<li>Has a swivel screen that most DSLRs lack - this makes it quite handy for shooting from awkward angles. Plus very useful when shooting video.</li>
<li>Nikon has quite a bunch of lenses, plus a very big used lens market (Nikon has stuck with its lens interface unlike Canon that upgraded in the 80s). This might however not be that valid outside of the USA and other developed markets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming to your specific questions, I would recommend 3 books to get you started on your journey:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding Exposure</strong> by Bryan Peterson - Explains the basic concepts like exposure, shutter speed, aperture etc</li>
<li><strong>The Digital Photography Book</strong> by Scott Kelby - A how-to book with gear recommendations, useful to learn shortcuts (4 parts in all with the first one covering the basic recipes). Alternatively, you can get a book specific to your camera.</li>
<li><strong>Photographer's Eye</strong> by Michael Freeman - Not an immediate read as it is more about visualization. <strong>Photographer's Mind</strong> by the same author is along similar lines and delves into the thought process behind image making.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for gear:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flash:</strong> You might eventually want to get an external flash (with bounce capability) if you end up doing a lot of shooting indoors, and this will significantly reduce the image quality limitations imposed by high ISO requirements indoors. Nikon is supposed to have an advantage over Canon in this regard.</li>
<li><strong>Lenses:</strong> Once you get hold of the basics, you will get to understand the limitations of the kit lens (focal length range, aperture)</li>
</ul>

<p>For software, you can start out with free software like Picasa for photo management and basic editing, and GIMP or Paint.NET for advanced editing. Adobe Lightroom is one of the most popular paid options, and there's always Photoshop if you want to do more.</p>

<p>Last but not the least, check out this site for a bunch of useful questions that will help you along, and keep shooting as practice is the best form of learning.</p>

"How to get the best results for landscape and stars photographs?","28599","","<p>I'm leaving for holidays tomorrow, and there's a good chance that I'll be able to be by night on a field with no artificial light around, and no moon in the sky. I'd love to take some picture of the landscape: the starry sky + the surrounding mountains' silhouettes.</p>

<p>Apart from bringing a tripod (duh), what should I do to get the best possible results?</p>
","<p>The approach you take will probably depend on whether you wish to photograph star trails, do short-exposure astrophotography, or long-exposure astrophotography. Star trails are relatively easy to capture, however short and long exposure astrophotography must be done with a little more care. These tips assume you are using a DSLR.</p>

<h3>Required Gear</h3>

<p>To take quality star shots, you'll need the proper gear. The specific gear may change depending on the kind of photography your are doing, but in general, you'll need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable Tripod

<ul>
<li>For star trails or short-exposure, any decent tripod will do</li>
<li>For long-exposure, an equatorial tracking mount will be required</li>
</ul></li>
<li>High-ISO camera

<ul>
<li>While not absolutely required, a camera that supports high ISO (3200 or greater) will generally have better low-ISO performance, reducing noise over your longer exposures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cable Shutter Release w/ Lock

<ul>
<li>A cable release for your shutter will eliminate camera shake caused by you pressing the shutter button, and should allow exposures longer than 30 seconds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fast lens

<ul>
<li>Again, while not an absolute requirement, a fast lens allows you to stop down a little bit and gain sharpness without reducing light too much</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extra batteries or battery grip or ac adapter

<ul>
<li>Long exposures can really suck up the battery power, bring along extra batteries.</li>
<li>If you intend to do hour-long shots, a battery grip that extends your battery life will be essential. </li>
<li>It may not be possible to get truly long shots, say 2-3 hours, with a digital camera, without an AC adapter.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Another requirement is a moonless sky.</p>

<h3>Capturing Star Trails</h3>

<p>Capturing star trails is fairly strait forward. You will not be tracking the stars across the sky, so an equatorial tracking mount will not be necessary. To capture star trails above a landscape, you will need to expose for a lengthy period of time, from several minutes to possibly a half hour or hours. A camera with good ISO performance will greatly help here, as very long shots heat up the camera sensor, and can cause a greater level of noise than you would normally get. An ISO setting of 100 or less, preferably 50 or 25, would be best.</p>

<p>Before taking your shot, set up your camera on the tripod, and frame and focus your shot. You should use a battery grip, or if possible, and AC adapter, to ensure you can take very long shots. Make sure you really like the composition, because it could be 30 minutes to several hours before you'll see the result and be able to try again. Keep in mind, you'll probably have to experiment for a while (i.e. several nights) before you really get the hang of things, and get a decent shot. Thats just part of the process (I have not yet taken a startrails shot I really like myself yet, and I've been at it every moonless weekend I've had for several months.)</p>

<p>Once you have your shot framed, you'll need to configure your camera. Best to use manual mode so you have full control. Set your aperture to around f/4, your ISO to 100, and set your shutter speed to BULB mode (most digital cameras can't meter beyond 30 second shutter speeds, and require BULB mode to shoot any longer.) Attach your cable release, and enable mirror lockup mode if you have it. When you are all set, press the shutter button on your cable release, and lock it into position. A cable release that supports automatic timing is a huge plus here, as you can set a time, such as 30 minutes or 2 hours, and go to sleep if you have to. If you can't afford a timer release, a basic lockable cable release will do, you'll just have to keep an eye on the time and manually unlock when your time is up.</p>

<p>I recommend starting with 30-45 minutes and experiment a bit, and check the results. Having a laptop you can export the images to can greatly help in your experimentation phase, as it can be difficult to really gauge the results on a camera view screen. From this point on, its a matter of experimentation. Shorter exposures will generally be darker, star trails will be short, but they will be very clear. Longer exposures up to an hour or several hours will expose the landscape around you, possibly to near daylight levels, and your star trails will be very long, possibly 130 degrees for a several hour shot. If you intend to take a very long exposure of several hours, and have ISO settings below 100, I would try using them, and see how the results look. If the shot turns out too bright, adjust your aperture. An aperture of f/5.6 or perhaps f/6.3 might be required to keep the ambient lighting at an appropriate level after a long exposure.</p>

<p>To get really long star trails, it is better to expose using an intervolometer so you can get many shots of shorter length, taken only moments apart. Stacking multiple photos of short startrails will result in a single image with very long startrails. The clarity and brightness of stacked startrails images are usually better than single exposure startrails images. To adequately stack, you will probably want to look into a tool like DeepSky Stacker or IRIS astronomical image processing tools.</p>

<h3>Capturing Short-Exposure Night Sky (Star and Milky Way) Shots</h3>

<p>Another form of astrophotography is the short-exposure star/milky way shot. Like star trails shots, these also require a normal tripod, but use a higher ISO and wider aperture. Fast lenses are extremely helpful here. You'll definitely want a moonless night to capture a decent sky shot. Set up your shot like you would for star trails, but set your ISO to 800 or so, and open your aperture wide. A lens with an f/2.8 aperture will be helpful, but one with a wider aperture, say f/1.4 or f/1.2 will be even better. Speed is important here to get saturation without star trails. If you are looking to get zoomed shots with a telephoto focal length, try to use a lens with an f/2.8 aperture...otherwise you'll have a hard time avoiding trails. In general, wider angles are better than telephoto, as the more you zoom, the more apparent the motion of stars will be. </p>

<p>Exposures that are intended to capture the sky without star trails need to be shorter. Once your shot is framed and focused, I would set your shutter speed to 10-15 seconds. Again, use mirror lockup and a cable release to open your shutter. Since your exposure times are much shorter here, you have a lot more time to experiment. You can try exposures up to 30 seconds or so, however around there you will likely start seeing trails. Keep an eye on your image noise, and adjust your ISO setting and shutter speed as appropriate. Noise from higher ISO settings (i.e. 1600, possibly even 3200 or more if you have extremely high ISO performance, like say a Canon 5D Mk II) may or may not be a big problem if you can get a brighter exposure. A good night sky shot that captures a lot of stars may not exhibit visible ""noisieness"" due to the fine pixel-sized point-like nature of the stars you are photographing. </p>

<p>Again, experimentation here is key. You will have a lot more opportunity to experiment with the much shorter exposure times, so use it as best you can.</p>

<h3>Capturing Long-Exposure Night Sky Shots</h3>

<p>Long-exposure sky shots require a bit more equipment and care than the other two forms. To capture long exposures of the sky without star trails, a special kind of mount will be necessary. An equatorial tracking mount is one which, once properly <em>set</em>, will track stars across the sky with keen accuracy, allowing you to expose for several minutes without getting trails.</p>

<p>Long-exposure shots will generally use a higher ISO than star trails shots, but likely less than short-exposure shots. I would try an ISO setting of around 400, possibly 800. Since you will be tracking the stars across the sky, you will have more flexibility with your aperture. You can choose to shoot wide open, or stop down in 1/2 or 1/3 increments. If you shoot wide open with an ISO of 400, start with a shutter speed of 5-8 minutes. If you use a higher ISO, you can reduce your shutter speed, unless you want a more saturated shot. Apertures between f/2.8 (or wider) down to f/5.6 are probably the most useful. Stars are point light sources, and will be particularly susceptible to diffraction, so avoid very tight apertures. I would avoid going lower than f/5.6 unless your sensor is very large with very large photosites. Always use your cable release with mirror lockup.</p>

<p>As always, experiment. You may need to try setting your equatorial mount a few times to get it set right the first few times you try. Once set, you have a lot of flexibility to experiment. A camera with very high ISO performance, such as the Canon 5D Mark II or 7D, will greatly improve the quality of your shots, as well as give you more options. Shooting at higher ISO settings such as 1600 or 3200 can improve the types of shots you might be able to achieve, and expand the volume of stars you can capture in a single shot.</p>

Looking around, I do not find a definition for exactly what this means, only suggestions like remove the battery and memory card and reseat them to make it go away, but many say it returns later.  What exactly does <code>CHA</code> mean and  how should one resolve it more definitively?</p>
","<p>The D90 uses <code>CHA</code> as a generic 'card error' condition if a problem occurs while the card is in use.  If the card works at all or has been working then it's unlikely to be a formatting issue.</p>

<p>This could just be a case of a poor connection and cleaning the contacts on the card and reseating everything may solve it.</p>

<p>If it has been working then there could be a problem with the card in which case you should be able to test it in a desktop machine and retire/replace it if necessary.</p>

<p>There is also an issue I've had with the D90 and larger memory cards (over 8gb) where it incorrectly calculates 'checksums' used to determine if there is a problem (although it writes them correctly) when the value isn't what it expects then you'll get a <code>CHA</code> message.
As a temporary resolution you can access the card in a reader and copy &amp; remove the last written file but if this is your issue then the problem will return at some point.</p>

<p>I've been in touch with Nikon about it but without being able to reproduce the issue at will Nikon have not been helpful.  The solution I ended up with was just to use multiple cards, which is no great hardship.</p>

"How durable are photographic canvas prints to moisture and humidity?","28413","","<p>I want to put photographic canvas prints on stretcher frames in my bathroom, how bad of an idea is this? Obviously it depends on how wet my bathroom is, but I would call it fairly typical, and it does have a fan that pulls air out and two doors. The canvas prints are typical of what you could get from mpix, prodpi, whcc, or canvas on demand.</p>

<p>My main question is around bonded canvas prints and durability.</p>
","<p>Most canvas prints use inks similar to (or actually are) big name inkjet inks like Epson and Canon. Such inks are susceptible to moisture and gaseous toxins and the like. Its kind of tough to generalize the print so much...all of the print houses you've listed use different kinds of canvas and different kinds of inks, and none of them really clearly specify what those inks are or how long they will last (a couple seem to indicate 100+ years, but don't specify under what conditions you might get such a lifetime.) </p>

<p>While you may not notice any change in the short term (i.e. a few years), hanging any canvas print that is printed with anything outside of modern Giclee inks (which are incredibly durable and excellent for canvas) will most likely not have a particularly long lifetime...I would say at most a couple decades, and after a number of years you'll likely start to see some fading or color shift. Only under archival conditions, wherein humidity and air quality and light are all controlled within a specific range, can you hope to achieve 100-200 year longevity.</p>

<p>You might also want to consider a clear protective spray. There are a variety of them available, and I am not sure if some are better suited to canvas prints or not. Usually you just need to evenly spray on a coat of this stuff once a print has fully cured (usually a full day, so if you send it off to a lab it should be cured by the time it gets to you). The spray should give your canvas prints much greater durability in a bathroom environment. It should protect from direct water exposure (splashing from sink or shower), and help protect a bit longer from fading.</p>

"Is it worth to upgrade from Canon 50mm f/1.8 to Canon 50mm f/1.4 on 550d?","28238","","<p>I'm a newbie in the world of DSLR photography, having played around with my Canon 550d for few months. After posting my <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/4333/sartorialist-like-street-photography-lens"">first question</a> here and getting some superb advices I decided to buy Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens. My primary interest is a street fashion photography. Here you can find my initial results with this gear: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/55855659@N08/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my Flickr page</a>. </p>

<p>My question is: is it worth to upgrade the above mentioned lens to Canon 50mm f/1.4? Will the out-of-focus (DoF) area be significantly larger? Also, how much better are photos taken in dark light conditions? For example using my current lens, I rarely can use ISO lower than 800. It would be great to be able to use values as low as 400 or 200.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate some real-world examples that compares those lenses:)</p>

<p>One more thing - if the answer is ""no"" - what would be your lens of choice that will nicely upgrade my setup.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Having used both lenses I'd say no it's not worth the upgrade.</p>

<p>The f/1.4 version is two thirds of a stop faster, which means where you'd use ISO 800 before you'd theoretically be able to use ISO 500. That sounds good, however that's only in the centre of the frame, the corners get significantly darker wide open. I rarely use mine wide open so for me there's no advantage.</p>

<p>The 50 f/1.4 is soft wide open. All high aperture lenses are but this one especially so. It also suffers from bloom and longitudinal CA, defects that make the images unacceptable to me. I had heard all this before buying the lens and bought three copies originally (from different retailers, different batches). All performed the same so I don't think there's anything wrong with my lens. </p>

<p>It improves stopped down to f/1.8 and is good at f/2. Conventional wisdom says that you'd be better using the 50 f/1.4 stopped down than the 50 f/1.8 wide open. This is incorrect. Whilst the 50 f/1.4 does improve stopped down, it starts off so soft that it is <strong>only equal to the 50 f/1.8 at f/1.8!</strong> dpreview's lens tests actually indicate the the 50 f/1.8 is in fact <em>slightly sharper</em> wide open than the other lens stopped down.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/canon_50_1p8_ii_c16/page3.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/canon_50_1p8_ii_c16/page3.asp</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Another reason to upgrade is build quality. Whilst the 50 f/1.4 is built better, it's still not as solid as Canon's other mid range lenses. The fact is the 50 f/1.4 doesn't have proper ring type ultrasonic focus motor, it has a micro USM which is no better really than a standard focus motor (though it is a little quieter). Full time manual focus is achieved by a special mechanism designed for the 50 f/1.4 and doesn't feel nearly as nice as the focus rings on genuine USM lenses. </p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, the 50 f/1.4 isn't a bad lens, I've taken many excellent image with it, it's just a pretty small improvement on the 1.8, and given the quality that lens produces compared to it's price tag, it's a bit of a marvel. That's why I'd recommend any Canon shooter to buy that lens even if they rarely shoot in low light. If Canon produced 50mm lens that was 3x better to justify the 3x price it would be one of the best lenses ever made for 35mm!</p>

<p>When compensating for focal length (to get the same field of view) a full frame 35 gives you a depth of field that is about 1.3 stops shallower, much more than the difference between f/1.8 and f/1.4</p>

<ul>
<li>In short, the 50 f/1.4 doesn't justify the price increase over the 1.8, the extra aperture range isn't that useful due to the softness, it's no better optically in the standard range (f/1.8 and up). Build is better but still not ""solid"".</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So having said no I'll offer the following recommendation, get the Sigma 50 f/1.4. It's a more recent lens, built from the ground up to combat many of the problems with fast standard lenses.</p>

<ul>
<li>It has a bigger front element to combat vignetting (dark corners).</li>
<li>It's sharper wide open</li>
<li>It has a proper ultrasonic focus motor</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't comment on build quality as I've never handled one, but as a bigger lens all round I would expect it to be a bit more solid. I don't shoot at 50mm enough to buy this in addition to the Canon but if anything happened to that lens I'd get the Sigma in a heartbeat!</p>

<hr>

<p>edit: if you want to go down the shallow DOF / extreme blur subject isolation route then a bigger sensor may be a better investment than a wider aperture. Used 5D mkI are going fairly cheap these days and they make excellent portrait cameras. Here's an example of the difference, 30D on the left, 5D on the right:</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I looked at your flickr stream - I really like what you're doing with the 50mm f/1.8, esp the ""sunset"" one! I wouldn't say you needed to have a shallower DOF in any of those shots.</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarifications.</p>
","<p>The 18-55mm lens in the first (cheapest) kit is a ""standard zoom"", an equivalent to the classic 28-80mm zoom for film SLRs. It's versatile range being wide enough at 18mm for most landscape and interior shots, and long enough at 55mm to shoot tight portraits (head and shoulders) whilst being a comfortable distance from your subject (which also avoids any <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/33981/is-there-a-difference-between-using-a-telephoto-or-wide-angle-lens-for-portraits"">weird perspective effects</a>).</p>

<p>The 18-135 is encroaching on ""superzoom"" territory, going from the same wide angle 18mm but all the way to 135mm, allowing you to shoot subjects that are  two and a half times as far away as the 18-55mm lens. This extra range adds to the complexity of the lens design accounting for the difference in price. </p>

<p>Whether this is worth the additional cost is up to you. In general it is better to get different lenses for different purposes rather than a single jack of all trades lens, however if you want to travel light, or are a casual photographer and don't want to change lenses all the time it may be the right lens for you.</p>

<p>There are several tools online (such as <a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/simulator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>, select ""DX"" as the format and compare 18mm, 55mm and 135mm) to help visualise the results of different focal lengths.</p>

"In what way does shutter speed affect a photo?","27553","","<p>Is there a rule like ""the lower the speed the better quality?""</p>

<p>I tried taking at different speeds but couldn't understand the difference.</p>
","<p>Shutter speed affects image quality in two principal ways. Firstly the longer the shutter is open (the slower the speed) the more light you get. The more light you get the less noise you have as it evens out the random emission of photons from a lightsource, and raises the signal produced by the sensor above the noise floor (the camera electronics produce a background level of noise, the bigger the signal you generate, by having more photons hit each pixel in the sensor, the less this background noise is noticed). This assumes you alter the other settings (aperture, ISO) to maintain the same exposure (overall brightness) in the image.</p>

<p>There is a point however when a long exposure can make an image noisier as it allows heat to build up on the sensor, which affects the recorded image.</p>

<p>Secondly shutter speed controls the impression of motion in an image. A long exposure/shutter speed blurs motion, giving the impression of greater motion of the camera or subject. It can enhance the image by making athletes or cars look like they're going very fast. It can detract from the image if the subject is not intended to be moving (e.g. a portrait) or if camera motion causes the image to come out blurred. </p>

"What is ""infinity focus""?","27450","","<p>I have been reading a bit about astrophotography and the term <code>infinity focus</code> keeps coming up. What is infinity focus and how do you set the camera to infinity focus?</p>
","<p>There are two ways ""infinity focus"" <em>could</em> be taken — ""an infinite amount of focus, so everything possible is in focus"", or ""focused on something infinitely far away"". In photography, it is specifically the second of these — <strong>infinity focus means your lens is focused so an infinitely-distant object would be sharp</strong>.</p>

<p>When an object is infinitely far away, the rays of light coming from it are, in theory, parallel. A lens set at <em>infinity focus</em> is set so that theoretical object would be in focus.</p>

<p>In practice, all stars are <em>close enough</em> to infinitely far away to count, and in fact for most purposes for photography, everything beyond a hundred feet or so (depending on focal length) is as well.</p>

<p>Note that almost all modern autofocus lenses can focus <em>past</em> infinity. This allows for much wider tolerance in manufacturing, and makes it possible to allow for changes due to temperature. Older manual-focus lenses usually are made so turning the focus ring all the way puts it at infinity.</p>

<p>Some macro lenses (or macro configurations) do not allow infinity focus, and this is also the case with some situations where you're adapting one lens type to another mount.</p>

<p>For earth-bound photography, if you wanted that first thing — an infinite amount of focus — the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/65/what-is-hyperfocal-distance"">hyperfocal distance</a> is often more useful than infinity focus, as this maximizes practical depth of field. If you're looking for infinite depth of field, unfortunately, you can't really have it (not with traditional optics), but this and a small aperture will do in many cases.</p>

"How do Micro 4/3s cameras compare with DSLR cameras?","27386","","<p>What are the major (and perhaps more subtle) differences between the newer Micro 4/3s format in comparison to the well-established DSLR cameras? What are the pros and cons of the Micro 4/3s format, the camera body and lens capabilities and offerings, size/weight, etc.</p>
","<p>The first technical difference is the fact that the sensor is smaller than the most common DSLR sensor sizes (APS-C and larger), whilst it's going to be less optimal than an APS-C, full frame or medium format (very expensive) sensor, it's still going to be far better than compact sensors. Noise will be comparable to APS-C (1.6x), though probably not <em>quite</em> as good, but this is also dependent on the sensor technology.</p>

<p>The second technical difference is that almost all Micro 4/3rds cameras currently use an electronic viewfinder, not an optical viewfinder. This means there is no phase detect auto-focus which is much quicker than contrast based auto focus. Phase detect AF can take less than a second in good light, whereas contrast AF can typically take 3-4 seconds and most often takes this long in any conditions.</p>

<p>Another difference is that on a lot of Micro 4/3rds cameras, the manual controls for aperture, shutter speed and ISO aren't as accessible as an SLR camera. If you plan on shooting manual with a Micro 4/3rds camera you may have to look around for the one that won't hinder you. For example, Sony's NEX-5 (not Micro 4/3rds but similar) apparently are very fiddly and it's better to just use them in an automated mode like Program mode.</p>

<p>A major physical difference is the size. The camera body itself is typically no larger than a large compact. The problem with this though is that the lenses are still fairly large when it comes to portability. You probably wouldn't try putting one in your pocket unless you have both a large pocket and a very short lens attached.</p>

"What is the Rule of Odds?","27211","","<p>In furthering my reading on photographic composition I came across a compositional technique called the ""Rule of Odds.""</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the ""Rule of Odds""? </li>
<li>Why is it important?</li>
<li>How do I apply it to my photography? </li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li><p>Rule of Odds states that having an odd number of objects in an image will be more interesting and therefore pleasing. In case there is an even number of objects, your brain would have an easy time ""organizing"" the objects into pairs and therefore bringing in symmetry and dullness. </p>

<p>If you have one main object, accompany it with two supporting objects, not one. This way, one of them will be a middle one. </p>

<p>We can find a parallel from the art of writing, where <em>rule of three</em> states remember that lists of three examples are the most efficient in carrying forward the presented idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Human eye tends to wander to the center of a group. With even number of objects, eye will end up at the negative space in center.</p>

<p>The rule becomes important when trying to achieve a visually pleasing composition of several objects. A common form of usage is having three objects in frame, they always form either a line or a triangle, both are considered pleasurable shapes. </p>

<p>(I have a Canon 60D)</p>
","<p><strong>Yes it is possible with all DSLRs.</strong></p>

<p>The 30s limit of all non-Olympus DSLRs is for timed exposures, meaning you dial in the time ahead of time and the exposure takes up to 30s (or 60s for Olympus).</p>

<p>All DSLRs also have a <em>bulb mode</em> which you press the shutter to start the exposure and let go when you are done. This can also be done with a remote control which is highly recommended to avoid shaking the camera during the exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Bulb modes also have limits</strong> but manufacturers do not all publish what it is. For Olympus and Panasonic, this is known to be 30 minutes. Some cameras can take a single exposure of several hours. Regardless of the model you are always limited to the battery-life of your camera unless you use an AC-Adapter and have somewhere to plug it in.</p>

<p>Digitally you can simulate extremely long exposures using Exposure Stacking which basically adds up multiple exposures to make a longer one. A lot of astro photography is done that way, just make sure that your camera does not apply Dark-Frame subtraction between shots otherwise you will have gaps in your star trails. On some cameras you can disable Dark-Frame Subtraction but not on all.</p>

<p>Following the initial introduction of both the III and IS II with the 1000D and 600D in March of 2011, the 1000D kits with the III were priced less than those with the IS II. Canon quickly dropped the III from the lineup, at least in the U.S., as consumers overwhelmingly preferred the IS version for a slightly higher cost. <strong>Any differences in tested optical performance should be attributable to copy-to-copy variation, as both held the same optical elements
as the 2007 EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS.</strong> The 'III' had the element used in the IS unit statically mounted in the optical path, the 'IS II' had an improved IS algorithm in the lens' firmware.

<h2>How do I avoid a dark subject when there's bright sunlight from windows?</h2>

<p>by <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/7188/franci"">Franci</a></p>

<p>I recently shot some photos at a friend's wedding. The location was lovely with lots of light — sometimes too much. The sunlight from the windows and skylights seemed to overpower the shot and the subject/people were very dark. What are some ways to avoid this without using fancy equipment? (I'm just starting out, I'm not a wedding photographer or anything!)</p>

<p>Here is one example I took — and this is <em>after</em> I've lightened it somewhat with Picasa:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/I8ExX.jpg"" alt=""example""></p>

<p>I'm using a Nikon D5000 with a standard 18-55mm lens.</p>
","<p>Metering from the background as rfusca suggests may not give you the results you desire - the background will likely be very overexposed spoiling the beautiful location. </p>

<p>One solution to that problem is to shoot two exposures and merge them. One exposure is optimal for your subject and one optimal for the background. If your subject remains relatively still merging them is not too difficult and there is a wide variety of software available to do this. Google ""HDR"" if unsure! One problem with this method is that if the background is significantly brighter than the subject then the shot exposed for the subject may have lens flare or other defects due to the strong backlight.</p>

<p>However it's better to do it in one go if you can so I would say if you have no external flash then use the internal one! It may produce harsher shadows due to the position. The best way to avoid this is to diffuse (spread out) the light, using a sheet of paper, white t-shirt, whatever is at hand.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> che's suggestion of a reflector is a good option for the case when the sun is in the wrong direction, it's worth noting that it wont work if you're in a large shadow area, you need a line of sight to the sun.</p>

"What are the RGB values that correctly represent a 5800 K white surface on a calibrated 6500 K monitor?","26712","","<p>Consider a high-quality monitor calibrated at the standard parameters: 6500 K, 2.2 gamma, 120 cd/m^2. Calibration is accomplished with a LaCie hardware sensor + its software, and it's quite accurate.</p>

<p>I intend to take a picture of the Sun through a telescope, using a safe, dedicated solar filter (full aperture Baader solar film for telescopes). The Sun's temperature is 5800 K. The filter is ""white"", quite decent actually, but I'm sure it's spectrum is not 100% flat - rigorously speaking it cannot be. Also, the camera may capture some infrared and so on, and further alter the color of the solar surface.</p>

<p>I want to process the resulting image so that, on the calibrated 6500 K monitor, the Sun's color is represented as close to original as possible. I expect the result to look like a soft creamy white.</p>

<p>Basically, that boils down to representing a 5800 K ""white"" on a 6500 K monitor. How do I do that?</p>

<p>I could load the image and tweak the tint settings (white balance) in software until the RGB triads on the solar disk fall in the required range, but I don't know what that range is. Sounds like there should be a formula for it somewhere (""given T1 the temperature of the monitor, then T2 white is represented when xR + yG = zB"" or something like that, I'm just making stuff up).</p>

<p>Another approach: it would be nice if there was an app that could just generate ""white"" at any temperature, given that the monitor is calibrated at a certain color temperature. Then I could compare the generated white with the Sun's image, and make adjustments. But I'm now aware of any such app.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I do most of my raw file processing in Lightroom, I can use GIMP for additional color channel tricks. I'm not a photography expert, obviously, but I can follow directions. :)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>The answer is:</strong> sRGB = (255, 241, 234).</p>

<p><strong>The details of the calculation:</strong></p>

<p>I calculated the spectrum of a blackbody at 5800 K using the Planck’s
formula, then multiplied by the CIE color-matching functions of the
standard 2 degrees observer and integrated over the wavelengths to get
the (X, Y, Z) color. I then divided by X+Y+Z to get the chromaticity:</p>

<pre><code>(x, y) = (0.3260, 0.3354)
</code></pre>

<p>multiplying (x, y, 1-x-y) by the
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB#The_forward_transformation_.28CIE_xyY_or_CIE_XYZ_to_sRGB.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XYZ to sRGB matrix</a>,
and dividing by the greatest component (R) yields:</p>

<pre><code>(R, G, B) = (1, 0.8794, 0.8267)
</code></pre>

<p>I then gamma-encoded, multiplied by 255 and rounded to the nearest
integer and got:</p>

<pre><code>(R’, G’, B’) = (255, 241, 234)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: My answer is in the sRGB color space, which is almost, but
not quite 6500 K with 2.2 gamma. BTW, “6500 K with 2.2 gamma” is not a
color space specification: you also need the chromaticities of the
primaries to get a fully-specified color space.</p>

"Why do light sources appear as stars sometimes?","26712","","<p>See for example this photo:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8IIp.jpg"" alt=""Example photo""></p>

<p>From my experience, the longer the exposure the stronger can this effect be observed. Is this correct? Are there any other factors that influence the creation of these stars (is there a better word for it, by the way?) And what exactly does technically happen?</p>
","<p>This appears to be a beautiful example of <strong>Fraunhofer diffraction</strong>.  It is due to the wave nature of light.  The effect depends on the wavelength (that is, the color).  It is most pronounced when bright light from a practically infinite distance passes through narrow slits, causing the light to spread <em>perpendicular</em> to the slits.  This spreads a point-like beam of light into a pair of streaks.</p>

<p>Using a small aperture creates slit-like situations at the corners formed by adjacent blades.  Thus, when you have a combination of <em>relatively intense, pointlike, monochromatic</em> light sources in the image and a <em>narrow aperture,</em> you should see a streak (of the same color) emanating from the points <em>in two directions</em> perpendicular to the blades.  When your diaphragm is formed by straight blades, this will cause there to be <em>twice as many</em> streaks as blades.  However, the streaks for parallel blades will coincide.  Thus, for a diaphragm with an odd number of blades (where no two blades are parallel) there will be twice as many radial streaks as blades but for a diaphragm with an even number of blades (where opposite blades are parallel) the streaks overlap in pairs, giving the same number of streaks as blades (<em>but each streak is twice as bright</em>).</p>

<p>A classic example is shown in the first image in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on diffraction</a>, for Fraunhofer diffraction through a square aperture.  You see four well-defined streaks.</p>

<p>The theory is further explained <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/fraunhofcon.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.  This explanation was published in 1967 by <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/2/5/001;jsessionid=4DB3BC010B85607A134975C9FE3C5209.c3"" rel=""noreferrer"">CA Padgham</a>.  Ken Rockwell mentions it in his <a href=""http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/bokeh.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">discussion of bokeh</a>.</p>

<p>We should expect a certain amount of diffraction always to be present.  It is usually slight and averaged out in most pictures: it just contributes a tiny amount to the blurriness that is present in any image when looked at closely enough.  Only in images that bring together several factors--points of intense monochromatic light, small apertures, straight diaphragm blades--will it become prominent.  This information shows how you can make the stars more prominent or how you can suppress them, by altering these factors for your exposure (to the extent you can).</p>

<p>Finally, length of exposure is related to the occurrence of this effect, as you have observed, but only because exposures with bright points of light are almost always made much longer than needed to record the lights: you're trying to see the rest of the scene, which is much darker.  The brightness of the diffraction streaks decreases so rapidly away from their sources that if you used a sufficiently short exposure to <em>properly</em> expose the lights themselves, the streaks would be practically invisible.  For instance, there are dimmer but still prominent light sources in your background: they look like windows in the far distance.  They, too, must have their own streaks, but those streaks are too dim to see.  (Appropriate software filtering might be able to bring them out.)</p>

"What is butterfly lighting, and when do I use it?","26617","","<p>I often hear the term 'Butterfly Lighting' used when discussing high-fashion and glamor photography. How do I set up Butterfly Lighting, and when do I use it?</p>
","<p><strong>What is Butterfly Lighting?</strong></p>

<p>Butterfly Lighting is one of the 5 basic lighting setups commonly used in studio portrait photography. It is also variously referred to as '<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6910/what-is-clamshell-lighting-and-when-should-it-be-used/6979#6979"">Clamshell Lighting</a>,''Glamor Lighting' 'Beauty Lighting,' or 'Paramount Lighting.' At its most basic, Butterfly consists of a single light pointed directly at the subject straight on, and raised high enough to create a downward shadow on the subject. This causes a little ‘butterfly’ shadow to appear directly underneath the subject’s nose. </p>

<p><em>One-light Butterfly Lighting setup:</em></p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmJci.jpg"" alt=""One-light Butterfly Lighting setup example""></p>

<p>Often the Butterfly Lighting setup is augmented by a reflector or fill ight in front of the subject, underneath and just outside the frame of the shot to bounce some light up into the eyes because a light at such a high camera angle generally causes the eyes to go very dark without it.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1rAWs.jpg"" alt=""One-light + reflector Butterfly Lighting setup example""></p>

<p><strong>When do I use Butterfly Lighting?</strong></p>

<p>Butterfly lighting is considered the ‘fashion’ or ‘glamor’ lighting setup. Often times this is a flattering look for high-school and college aged girls. It is especially well suited to women with narrow faces and high cheekbones, but because there is very little shadow cast on the face it can add weight to the subject with a  rounder face. Additionally, the lack of shadows means that it is unsuitable for subjects who have skin problems, facial scars, facial hair, etc.. Although it is occasionally used as a fashion setup for men, it is so commonly used in women's fashion photography that it has become 'synonymous' with women's glamor lighting. So much so that even people who don't pay much attention to such things may still feel like a portrait of a man with Butterfly Lighting looks 'funny' somehow, even if they can't articulate why. Additionally, the lack of facial shadow that is cast by the light is generally not especially flattering unless the man’s features are somewhat feminine already.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm using Lightroom CC. I read something once about installing an addon within Lightroom but the option wasn't there because Creative Cloud is apparently slightly different from the older versions?</p>
","<p>cmason's answer has covered how to get the photos out of Photos. </p>

<p>However, here's where you first went wrong.  When you import images to Lightroom, Lightroom gives you four different ways to do this, and they're all at the top of the Import window.  You select which one you want by clicking on it. From left to right, the options are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Copy as DNG</strong>. This converts your RAW images to DNG (Adobe's digital negative) file format as the files are imported. The RAW files are left on the card. This has the tradeoff of not requiring sidecar .xmp files to store the edit history of the file, but can lose you proprietary metadata of the specific RAW format you're using.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy</strong>. This copies the photo files from where they are into wherever you tell Lightroom to put them as you import. This will leave all the files on the card alone, which can be useful if there's a problem with the import, you want to keep the card for backup, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Move</strong>. This moves the photos from where they are into wherever you tell Lightroom to put them as you import, which will automatically remove the files from the card. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add</strong>.  This just adds the photos to the Lightroom catalog where they're resident. This can be handy if you like to copy the files from the card to where you want them to live on your OSX box by hand before doing the import.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think you accidentally did 4) when you meant to do 2) or 3), which is why Lightroom cataloged the photos on the card, rather than those same files moved/copied on your hard drive.</p>

<p>Which one is right for you depends on your personal work habits. Once you've established how you like to import files, you can then save everything as an ""Import preset"" at the bottom middle of the Import window, and use the arrow on the lower left corner to minimize what the window shows to just what your preset is concerned with.</p>

"What are the differences between E-TTL, i-TTL, and P-TTL?","26420","","<p>Canon, Nikon and Pentax each have their own TTL flash metering systems, respectively E-TTL, i-TTL, and P-TTL. They all use a weak preflash that is metered and used to calculate flash power level required for correct exposure, but I suspect there might be differences in implementation details.</p>

<p>What are the nuances by which the modern TTL systems differ, and in which situations do strengths and weaknesses of these metering algorithms show?</p>

<p>I already know that each system is brand-specific and uses different hot-shoe contacts, so no need to mention that.</p>
","<h2>Canon E-TTL</h2>

<p>E-TTL stands for ""Evaluative Through the Lens"" and was introduced in 1995. </p>

<p>A low power preflash is fired immediately before shutter opens and its reflectance is measured to determine correct flash exposure. Entire frame is analyzed by the same evaluative exposure metering system as ambient exposure, area under active AF point is given more emphasis in calculations.</p>

<p>If the ambient light level is above 10 EV (Exposure Value), flash exposure is automatically dialed down, unless the feature, called ""Auto Fill Flash Reduction"" (a.k.a. ""automatic reduction of flash output""), is disabled. At 10EV, the compensation is -0.5EV, increased by -0.5EV for each additional EV of light, capped at -2EV compensation for light levels 13EV and above.</p>

<p>Exposure compensation that has been set on the body is not applied to flash exposure; you have to use flash exposure compensation to affect flash exposure.</p>

<p>Immediate preflash before real exposure can cause subjects to close their eyes, so you can use FEL (Flash Exposure Lock) to perform preflash metering in advance.</p>

<p>E-TTL can also be used to control and meter wireless flashes. There are 4 channels to separate multiple photographers in same location. Flashes can be arranged into two or three groups (depending on master flash); the groups are metered separately by a quick succession of preflashes. Exposure ratios for groups A and B and exposure compensation for group C can be controlled on master flash (always in group A).</p>

<h3>E-TTL II</h3>

<p>Most significant advancement is that evaluative flash metering is no longer based on assumption that an active autofocus point covers the subject. All changes are in camera body, any flash supporting E-TTL (such as all Canon EX flashes) can also be used by in E-TTL II.</p>

<p>There are two modes for weighting the zones (selectable in camera Custom Functions) - evaluative and averaged. Evaluative mode uses pre-flash analysis information to determine weights for the zones - the zones with slight differences from ambient light are selected for flash exposure calculation; high difference areas are disregarded as possibly highly reflective to avoid underexposure. In averaged mode, results from metering zones from the middle of frame (area AF ellipse) are averaged equally and the rest of frame is ignored.</p>

<p>If such an EF lens is used that provides distance information, that information is used to determine a ballpark exposure which is then used to refine calculations. There are several exceptions when the distance information is ignored: macro flash, wireless flash, bounce flash (whenever flash head is not straight nor using slight downward tilt).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Nikon iTTL</h2>

<p>Introduced in 2003. Similar to E-TTL, ambient and flash metering is performed during preflash immediately before mirror rises and shutter opens. Reflected light is measured (lens wide open) with 5-segment flash sensor in center of frame, and required flash power is calculated, using also data from RGB sensor concerning data on light and shadow areas, subject distance (from lens), reflectance, color temperature.</p>

<p>Originally, iTTL flash exposure metering was completely separate of ambient exposure metering (using only the same hardware); more recent bodies, starting from D3 and D300, automatically underexpose ambient exposure in bright light when flash is turned on to prevent overexposure in areas lit by flash.</p>

<p>Exposure compensation is applied to both ambient and flash exposure; if only ambient exposure compensation is needed, this can be counter-compensated with flash exposure compensation.</p>

<p>The flashes can again be divided into up to three groups, each of which is metered by a separate preflash. In iTTL, the computed required power level is immediately sent back to the group. All flashes in same group fire at same level. Note that since the groups are metered individually, there is no handling for situations where same spot is lit by several groups; the camera instructs the groups to fire with slight underexposure to cope with that. Each group can be instructed from master flash to fire in TTL (you can also adjust flash exposure compensation for the group) or at a manual power setting. </p>

<p>Also, there are 4 channels available to enable multiple photographers use each their own flashes.</p>

<p><strong>TTL-BL</strong> is a separate mode for fill flash. For successful operation, it requires that subject is darker than background, and works to brighten it to balance with the background.</p>

<p><strong>TTL-FP</strong> is Nikon's term for high speed sync.</p>

<p>Similar to FEL in E-TTL, FV Lock can be used to perform preflash metering in advance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Pentax P-TTL</h2>

<p>First appearance in 2001. Similar to others, P-TTL meters a low power preflash with lens wide open before opening shutter and calculates needed flash power level.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be any way for triggering preflash metering manually.</p>

<p>With a P-TTL flash turned on, exposure compensation is applied to both ambient and flash exposure. However, there is a quirk - when using positive exposure compensation, shutter time is capped at ""handholdable value"" - roughly 1/(1.5 x <em>focal length</em>) seconds. When shutter time reaches that value, further positive compensation only affects flash exposure. The cap on shutter time is applied even if it means underexposure without any compensation - camera hopes flash to fill in the gaps. In <b>P</b>rogram mode, aperture does not change when compensation is adjusted.</p>

<p>There are 4 wireless channels; when you use pop-up flash as the controller, a flash has to be paired with camera body (on hot shoe) to make the body use the same channel. The flashes cannot be arranged into groups available to be controlled from camera or controller flash; exposure compensation has to be set on each flash separately.</p>

"Recommended start point for sharpening RAW Images","26391","","<p>I'm just beginning to get back into serious photography after a very long time away. I've toyed with digital, but this is my first foray into trying to do controlled creative work in the digital format.</p>

<p>I'm not certain if the original capture equipment matters much, but I'm currently shooting with a Nikon D3100, and several pieces of Nikon Glass.</p>

<p>For processing right now, I'm working with Lightroom 4.</p>

<p>From what I've read, due to the filters located on the sensor, all RAW files could stand some level of sharpening in post processing. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.</p>

<p>While I understand that the exact amount of sharpening that is appropriate will depend on the image itself...Is there some rule of thumb that can be used as a starting point, particularly when batching a large number of similar raw files? I suppose a follow-up would be, DOES the camera used to capture the image affect that recommendation in any significant way?</p>

<p>Let me know if there is any additional information I can give to help answer.</p>
","<p>In general, yes, RAW files will need sharpening. This is for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, the processes (both at the physical sensor level and in software) to convert the raw data to a useful image tend to result in soft-looking images. for more details, see the answers in <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/9439/why-should-my-last-post-processing-step-be-sharpening"">Why should my last post-processing step be sharpening?</a> and <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10476/why-do-photos-look-best-without-any-sharpening"">Why do photos look best without any sharpening?</a></li>
<li>Most in-camera JPEG conversions apply at least some sharpening, so unsharpened RAW files will appear ""soft"" in comparison.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a quick starting point for sharpening RAW captures (and reducing noise) in Lightroom, I suggest <a href=""http://www.sansmirror.com/articles/proper-noise-reduction-in.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thom Hogan's quick guide to proper sharpening and noise reduction</a>. That's a great little introduction to what the various sliders in Lightroom are doing. There's also a great description of the Lightroom sharpening sliders in <a href=""http://lightroom-news.com/lightroom-11-update/sharpening/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article on Lightroom News</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, every image really is different when it comes to sharpening. Here's how I do it when I'm going down the sliders in Lightroom:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with setting <strong>Amount</strong> at 50 or maybe 100. It <em>needs</em> to be above 0 or else there's no sharpening at all and you can't see what the other sliders are doing. It almost certainly won't stay here; you'll come back to this.</li>
<li><strong>Radius</strong> depends strongly on the type of detail in the image. Lots of fine details, go with smaller values. If there's not a lot of fine details, you can go higher. You can also use <strong>Detail</strong> to suppress the effects of Radius and Amount on fine details.</li>
<li>I start <strong>Detail</strong> at 50. At that level it won't be suppressing the fine details halo very much and you can judge what <strong>Amount</strong> is really doing. Lower values reduce the effects of Amount and Radius on fine details, while higher values apply more sharpening to fine details. </li>
<li>Set <strong>Masking</strong> as high as you possibly can so that the sharpening is only affecting edges you want (hold Alt/Option while dragging to see the mask). Remember that affected areas are white, so you want <strong>white edges</strong>.</li>
<li>With the radius, detail, and masking set, adjust <strong>Amount</strong> according to your taste. </li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, you don't want to over-sharpen at this point, and you don't want the sharpening halos around close-proximity edges smashing into each other and ruining the effect. </p>

<p>If you have an area with a lot of fine detail where the edges are competing with each other, first try reducing <strong>Detail</strong>, then <strong>Radius</strong> until they're no longer conflicting.</p>

<p>You'll come back to everything again after you apply noise reduction. It never stops!</p>

<p>This is just a starting point – every image is different and you might have a workflow or look that you prefer.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you can also get into creative sharpening (you're probably going to want Photoshop for its layer and blending controls for that) and output sharpening (which Lightroom handles pretty well). For a little more on those, see <a href=""http://static.photo.net/attachments/bboard/00U/00Ua0l-175557684.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Patrick Levoie's guide to digital sharpening (.pdf)</a>. For lots more details, I'd also recommend the book <em>Real World Image Sharpening</em> by Bruce Frasier and Jeff Schewe.</p>

"Why are the ""MG"" Canon printers better for photography than the ""MX""?","26257","","<p>Looking at consumer level printers, but wanting to get the best bang for my buck, I noticed that Canon has <a href=""http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">two separate lines of all-in-one printers</a>. The ""MG"" line they advertise as ""<a href=""http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction/photo_all_in_one_inkjet_printers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Photo All-In-One</a>"" printers, and the ""MX"" line as ""<a href=""http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction/office_all_in_one_inkjet_printers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Office All-In-One</a>"" printers. </p>

<p>The only significant difference I found between models of similar cost (PIXMA MX882 and PIXMA MG6220 both $200) is that the MG/Photo line has an <strong>additional ink tank</strong> dedicated for grey that should be better for photography. Am I missing something else or is that really it? I am just confused why they segment the entire line and call it ""Photo"" when not all of the printers even have the grey ink tank.</p>
","<p>The additional inks are part of it, but there's also the matter of drop sizing, drop positioning and dithering algorithms. A photo-oriented printer will produce text and business-type graphics that are a little less crisp than they can be, and long, smooth, pure gradients often pick up a bit of banding†, while a text-and-graphics printer tends to add subtle artifacts to photographic images by finding and enhancing what it perceives to be edges -- an effect not unlike oversharpening.</p>

<p>If the most important aspect of your printing is going to be photographs, then go with a photo printer -- its text output won't be all that bad. You'd notice a difference in a side-by-side comparison with an equivalent-level text-and-graphics printer on a top-quality hard-finished paper, but you wouldn't notice anything deficient on its own at font sizes greater than about 6 points. (Long gradients in printed PowerPoint slides might not be perfect -- but printed PP slides are not the intended end product unless you're stuck with an old overhead projector, and they have enough optical problems that nobody would ever be the wiser.) You will, however, notice that your photos won't be nearly as good as they might be if you use a general-purpose printer, even if you can't quite put your finger on why.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>† Real photographic images rarely have long, smooth, pure gradients; there's almost always some amount of noise even in, say, a blue sky to add a degree of ""natural dithering"".</sup> </p>

"How can I make short people look taller in photographs?","26198","","<p>I was browsing some great shots from Herb Ritts and came across this <a href=""http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTKa_63alCDxSR74OFv86Bm7Jz8J4NG6hnziPFXILud8NDLt8K13w"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">photo</a> (NSFW). It seems like the legs of the woman appear longer in relation to her body. Is this an effect of the lens used? </p>

<p>Since many of the women I photograph are short it would be great if I was able to mimic this effect to make them look taller. The image is especially curious to me because the woman subjects I shoot all happen to have short legs, so the 'lengthening' effect in the photo would be very welcome by them.</p>

<p>If I use using wider angle lenses... How wide would I need to go with an APC sensor? </p>

<p>Does lighting play a role at all?</p>
","<p>Use a wide angle lens and position yourself low down, as others have stated:</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3616/3441930940_49f0ee40bd_z.jpg?zz=1""></p>

<p>Giant legs on even the shortest subject guaranteed! This was shot with a 10mm, the effect is more subtle at longer focal lengths. </p>

<p>Wide angle lenses accentuate perspective, they increase the distance in size between near and far objects. By getting low you are making the subjects legs the closest thing to the camera, thus they appear disproportionally larger.</p>

<p>This is the same reason you should use a longer lens for regular portraits, a wide angle will make the closest parts of the face (nose, chin, forehead) seem larger which is not very flattering! Taking this advice to the extreme is why you see fashion photogs using 300mm lenses and directing their models using walkie-talkies! </p>

<p>Is this is the maximum f-stop, the ideal, or something else?</p>
","<p>It refers to the maximum f-stop (which is defined as the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter). Smaller number means larger opening and more light:</p>

<ul>
<li>f0.9 to f1.2 is exceptional</li>
<li>f1.4 is very fast, usually the pro primes with less than 100mm focal length have this aperture</li>
<li>f1.8 to f2.4 - still quite fast</li>
<li>f2.8 - good pro zooms and long pro teles usually have f2.8 constant maximum aperture (constant only applies to zooms, see below)</li>
<li>f4 - good consumer-prosumer zooms and very long pro teles usually have f4 constant maximum aperture</li>
<li>f4-5.6 - aperture range denotes variable aperture zooms, meaning you lose light when zooming in (70-300 f4-5.6 is f4 lens at 70mm and f5.6 lens at 300mm)</li>

"How can I calculate what the effect of an extension tube will be?","25779","","<p>There must be a mathematical description of the difference that an extension tube makes to a lens -- is it something that can be easily described?</p>

<p>(For example, with teleconverters you can say things like ""a 2x teleconverter will turn a Y-mm lens into a 2Y-mm lens, and will lose you 2 stops."" Is there something similar for extension tubes?)</p>

<p>If there's nothing much you can say about magnification, in general, what about the change in closest focal distance? Is that also lens-dependent?</p>

<p>What about if we factor out the lens: is there any general way to compare the effects of (say) a 12mm and a 24mm extension tube on the <em>same</em> lens?</p>
","<p>I do believe there are some formulas you can use. To Matt Grum's point, I have not tested these with zoom lenses, and to my current knowledge, they apply only to prime (fixed focal length) lenses. You did not specifically specify zoom lenses, so...</p>

<p>The simplest way to calculate the magnification of a lens is via the following formula:</p>

<pre><code>  Magnification = TotalExtension / FocalLength
  M = TE / F
</code></pre>

<p>To calculate the magnification with an extension tube, you need to know the total extension...that is, the extension provided by the lens itself, as well as that provided by the extension tube. Most lens statistics these days include the intrinsic magnification. If we take Canon's 50mm f/1.8 lens, the intrinsic magnification is 0.15x. We can solve for the lenses built in extension like so:</p>

<pre><code>   0.15 = TE / 50
   TE = 50 * 0.15
   TE = 7.5mm
</code></pre>

<p>The magnification with additional extension can now be computed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>  Magnification = (IntrinsicExtension + TubeExtension) / FocalLength
  M = IE + TE / F
</code></pre>

<p>If we assume 25mm of additional extension via an extension tube:</p>

<pre><code>  M = 7.5mm + 25mm / 50mm
  M = 32.5mm / 50mm
  M = 0.65x
</code></pre>

<p>A fairly simple formula that allows us to calculate magnification fairly easily, assuming you know the intrinsic magnification of the lens (or its intrinsic extension.) If we assume the wonderful 50mm lens is the lens you are extending, to create a 1:1 macro magnification, you would need 50mm worth of extension. The problem here is that if you add too much extension, the plane of the world that is in focus (the <em>virtual image</em>) might just end up <em>inside</em> the lens itself. Additionally, this assumes a ""simple"" lens, one with very well-defined and well-known characteristics (i.e. a simple single-element lens.)</p>

<p>In a real-world scenario, having a clear understanding of any particular lenses characteristics is unlikely. With lenses that focus internally, or zoom lenses, the simple formula above is insufficient to allow you to calculate exactly what your minimum focusing distance and magnification can be for any given lens, focal length, and extension. There are too many variables, most of which are likely to be unknown, to calculate a meaningful value.</p>

"What's wrong with the Canon EF-S 15-85mm?","25728","","<p>Maybe this question should be on meta. I've just come across the Canon EF-S 15-85mm. It's been available since 2009. I'm just wondering why it has never been mentioned on photo_se_com or any of the other photo sites that I read. Granted, I've since found it on dpreview announced (not reviewed) and a few other places and it is available at Amazon. But it never comes up in lists of ""what lenses should I buy"".</p>

<p>To me, this seems like the perfect walk-about lens (I like wide) for the casual photog and yes, it is a bit slow, and yes it is a bit expensive. My question is, are there any major problems with this lens that would justify its relative anonymity. As I said it's never been mentioned on photo_se_com, which seems odd for such a versatile range.</p>
","<p>It doesn't provide too much advantage over a standard 17/18-55 kit lens: small, variable aperture (3.5-5.6), an only slightly wider wide end, and an only slightly longer tele end.</p>

<p>Unless you really need both ""just a little bit wider"" and ""just a little bit longer"", you might as well spend your $700 on a lens that fits your needs better: perhaps a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0002Y5WXE"" rel=""noreferrer"">10-22mm f/3.5-4.5</a> or an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001ET6QFY"" rel=""noreferrer"">18-200 f/3.5-5.6</a>, which would provide a faster aperture at 85mm than the 15-85 listed.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd rather sacrifice the 15-17mm range, crop if I need 85, and get a faster standard zoom like the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000EW8074"" rel=""noreferrer"">17-55 f/2.8</a>.</p>

"Which focal-length lens is usually used for portrait photography, and why?","25104","","<p>What focal length or range of focal lengths are usually used for portraits? </p>

<p>What is used by professionals? Why would one select a certain focal length? What are the advantages and disadvantages of different choices, and are there certain situations where an unusual choice might be better?</p>
","<p>It depends a bit on the kind of portrait you want to take, but there are two key things you want to do regardless:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not distort your subject. If you're too close to the subject things get warped, so whilst using your wide-angle and getting right up to the nose of your subject may produce an amusing result, it's seldom what you want (but as with all things, it can be great when used sparingly).</li>
<li>Throw the background out of focus, drawing attention to your subject.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bearing in mind that you want to be stood a reasonable distance from the subject to avoid the first issue, for a head-and-shoulders type shot, you'd normally be looking at something that's the full-frame equivalent of 80-85mm, so about 50mm on an APS-C sensor with a crop-factor of 1.6x (Canon).</p>

<p>For a 3/4s length type shot you'll want to be using a wider lens; something like a 50mm on a full-frame body, so about 35mm on a 1.6x crop sensor. You'll get more depth of field with the shorter lens, so may need to ensure the subject is far enough from the background so you can still throw it out of focus. Needless to say fast primes are the norm for portraiture.</p>

"What is the relationship between ""macro"" and ""telephoto"" lenses?","25043","","<p>Can anyone explain the difference between ""macro"" and ""telephoto""?</p>

<p>I know that a macro lens will give you a magnification of 1:1 but how does it differ from a telephoto lens?</p>
","<p><strong>There is no direct relationship between <em>Telephoto</em> focal lengths and <em>Macro</em> capability.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Macro</em> lenses allow closer focusing than most lenses.</strong> By allowing you to get the subject closer to the camera, it allows you to increase the size of the subject in your photo. Macro capability is measured in terms of <em>Maximum Magnification (MM)</em> that is only indirectly related to focal length. Magnification is expressed as the ratio between the actual size of the subject and the size of the subject's image that is projected onto the film/sensor. A 1:1 Macro lens, which has an <em>MM</em> of 1.0x or 100%, means if the subject is 15mm tall, the lens can get close enough to project a properly focused image of the subject on the focal plane that is 15mm tall. A 1:2 lens would have an <em>MM</em> of 0.5x or 50% and would project an image 7.5mm tall of the 15mm subject. This is because if both lenses are the same focal length the 1:2 lens would require twice the distance to properly focus on the 15mm subject. </p>

<p><strong>Most <em>Telephoto</em> lenses are designed to focus on distant subjects</strong>, not to reproduce nearer subjects at high magnifications. A 600mm lens will do very well at taking a 6 foot tall human at very large distance (a little over 400 feet) and filling the 36mm tall sensor frame (full frame is 36mm x 24mm) in portrait orientation. I've never seen a 600mm lens that can get close enough to a 36mm subject to fill the same frame and properly focus on it. By the time you are close enough to the subject, you are inside the lens' <em>Minimum Focus Distance (MFD)</em> by several yards/meters. Most telephoto lenses have very large <em>MFD</em> and thus small <em>MM</em> numbers. That is what a Macro lens is designed to do: by reducing the <em>MFD</em> you can focus on a much closer object and get a higher <em>MM</em>.</p>

<p>There are some telephoto zoom lenses on the market, usually in the 70-300mm range, that claim to be <em>Macro</em> capable. But if you examine the specifications of such lenses, you see that at best they are 1:3 in terms of magnification. They can only focus close enough to project a 15mm image of a 45mm subject. That gives them an <em>MM</em> of .33x or 33%. While it is theoretically possible to design a telephoto zoom lens with 1:1 <em>Macro</em> capability, it is not practical. Most true <em>Macro</em> lenses have a fixed focal length designation that allows them to be simpler, cheaper than a comparable zoom lens would be, and produce better image quality at closer subject distances.</p>

<p><strong>There are some fixed focal length prime lenses that fall into the Telephoto range in terms of focal length and also are capable of close enough focus to be <em>Macro</em> lenses. But a lens doesn't have to be a telephoto lens to have <em>Macro</em> capability and there are many <em>Macro</em> lenses that have shorter-than-telephoto focal lengths.</strong></p>

","<ol>
<li><p>At f/1.8 the depth of field is very small - any movement (of subject or camera) between focusing and taking the shot can push the subject out of focus - so you want to take the photo as quickly as possible after focusing and don't use the ""focus and recompose"" technique - not at f/1.8</p></li>
<li><p>The auto-focus on the 50mm f/1.8 is very slow, if the camera is set up to take the photo even if focus isn't locked it's possible you take pictures before the lens finished focusing - when the camera focuses it will beep and a small circle will light up in the view finder.</p></li>

"Why do RAW images look worse than JPEGs in editing programs?","24845","","<p>I've found that when you load a RAW image into an editing program such as Lightroom/Aperture, the image is usually worse than if you just took the image as JPEG. Now I understand that the camera does some magic during the JPEG conversion. But I'm trying to understand what that ""magic"" is. </p>

<p>If I'm looking to implement that ""magic"" myself on the desktop, what kind of settings should I be trying? I find that the RAW files have more extreme contrast. The dark areas for example are way darker than JPEG. Why is this? And what is the best way to fix this? </p>
","<p>A JPEG from a camera is simply a RAW image that has had some additional processing applied.</p>

<p>When viewing a RAW image in an image editing program, that program has to go through exactly the same steps as the camera did.</p>

<p>If there is any difference in appearance, it is only due to differences in the following (in very rough order from most to least important).</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Contrast / Gamma correction</em></p>

<p>Gamma correction is applied which converts from the linear values to gamma corrected values as required by digital image files.  This correction is not a straight gamma correction; a contrast curve is applied to ensure that highlights and blacks curve off nicely.  Some cameras store the camera's contrast setting in the RAW file and some RAW editors can use this; otherwise RAW editors will use an in-built contrast curve.  This can create quite a noticeable difference between the in-camera JPEG and an equivalent RAW viewed in an image editor.  The contrast curve affects not only the appearance of contrast but also, indirectly, the colour saturation.  The great thing about working with a RAW file is that you have full control over the contrast curve applied in software, before lossy operations such as sharpening, noise removal or JPEG compression have to take place.</p></li>
<li><p><em>White balance</em></p>

<p>White balance correction is applied to correct for different colour temperatures of light sources while taking the picture.  Some cameras store the camera's white balance setting in the RAW file and some RAW editors can use this; otherwise RAW editors will guess the correct white balance to apply.  This can create quite a noticeable difference between the in-camera JPEG and an equivalent RAW viewed in an image editor.  Again, this can also be viewed as a benefit of editing in RAW, in that you are free to re-set the white balance without any lossy artefacts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sharpening and noise reduction</em></p>

<p>An appropriate amount of sharpening and noise reduction are applied to enhance the image and try to suppress annoying noise.  There are different sharpening and noise reduction algorithms, and this is a lossy procedure.  If this is done in-camera, then you are stuck with whatever sharpening and noise reduction was applied by the camera.  A RAW image editor can adjust these values.  Differences in the sharpening and noise reduction between that the camera uses and that a RAW image editor uses could create a small difference in the appearance of an image.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Colour space conversion</em> </p>

<p>Red, green and blue in the Bayer filter are not necessarily the same hue as red, green and blue in the standard sRGB colour space.  The camera does colour correction to convert the colours into the desired colour space, which is usually sRGB.  If you an equivalent image in a RAW image editor, it will also do colour space conversion, but it may use a different colour matrix for the conversion due to the manufacturer of the RAW editing software not having access to the same colour matrices used in the camera.  If your RAW editing software is correctly configured, this step should not cause any noticeable difference in the resulting picture.  Those who know what to look for (for example, Canon or Adobe's signature colour profiles, which try to enhance skin tones and blues) may be able to notice the difference especially when testing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Demosaicing</em></p>

<p>A RAW image does not store colour values for every pixel - instead each value is either a red, green or blue value.  However, you need each pixel to have all three colours - red, green and blue - for the final image.  Therefore, a demosaicing algorithm has to guess the other two colour parts for each pixels, and it does this based on knowledge of surrounding pixels.  There are a variety of different demosaicing algorithms with varying qualities, and it is a lossy process.  If this occurs in-camera, then you are stuck with the camera's built-in algorithm.  If you use a RAW image editor, it will use its own algorithm.  The demosaicing algorithm used is not a huge contributor to overall image quality, but can affect its sharpness, the degree to which it shows aliasing artefacts, and whether it throws away the edges of the image.</p></li>
<li><p><em>JPEG compression</em></p>

<p>For a JPEG image produced by a camera, the resulting image data is compressed as a JPEG.  This is also, obviously, a lossy procedure and can make a difference when comparing it to a RAW image viewed in an image editor, though in most cases the difference shouldn't be noticeable.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, the biggest points of difference between the JPEG produced by the camera and an equivalent RAW produced in an image editor are likely to be caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different white balance in both</li>
<li>Different contrast curve / contrast adjustment in both</li>
</ul>

PNG has exactly-reversible, lossless compression, it is a net-friendly format so any web browser can view it, and it supports full transparency.</p>

<p>I've seen several people say that TIFF has a ""higher quality"" than PNG, but no one provides any details on exactly how it is of higher quality. PNG-24 is lossless, so when you ""Save As"" a TIFF to a PNG, how exactly are you losing quality?</p>
","<p>You explicitly mentioned PNG-24 - that has eight bits per channel, whereas a TIFF file can have 16.  That would be one reason the quality could be higher, from a RAW conversion especially but also if you are doing a lot of editing.</p>

<p>The PNG standard also supports 16-bits per channel (PNG-48) but I don't know how many applications support that, whereas pretty much anything that can read TIFF is going to be able to read a 16-bit TIFF file.</p>

<p>TIFF can also store layers in it, which is not a quality issue so much as a flexibility thing.  PNG is really meant to hold an image, not a layered set (although APNG can hold a set, it's really not for the same purpose).</p>

<p>One additional bit of practical information is that TIFF can store many kinds of Photoshop layers, I have used it for images which had a number of adjustment layers applied.  That is not possible with PNG, you would have to flatten the whole image.</p>

"How to nail focus for DSLR astrophotography?","24681","","<p>I've been doing a bit of astrophotography and the problem that I almost always have is nailing focus.

","<p>A very simple, yet effective method to achieve almost perfect focus is to use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahtinov_mask"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bahtinov mask</a>.

Also a note: I am thinking of cheaper or cheapest flashes when I say flash. Something like YongNuo series and Not Canon 600Ex.</p>

<p>(Edit: There one other question which has answers that list every advantage of using an external flash. I could get that from Google god. But I want to know the needs/thinking in photography that leads to it.)</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I want to know the needs/thinking in photography that leads to it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It starts off with you needing <strong>more light</strong> in a given situation. Either you getting extremely grainy photos due to low light, or you are in need of a wider lens but can't afford the slower maximum aperture, or you are struggling to eliminate camera shake with slower shutter speeds.</p>

<p>However once you start to learn how to use flash, and you get the flash off camera or at the very least not pointing directly at your subject then you start to realise that it's not just about more light, it's about <strong>better light</strong> too.</p>

<p>The majority of indoor lighting these days is fluorescent, which is improving but does not yet have the broad spectrum of flash lighting. Far worse are the old style tubes found in office buildings, churches and sports halls - the spectra produced by these lights are very narrow, missing a large part of the red spectrum leading to unnatural green/yellow looking skin-tones. In addition to this the colour changes massively through the 50/60Hz mains cycle giving you very inconsistent results. Flash gives you a very broad spectrum centred around <strong>natural sunlight</strong> (colour can be tuned up or down with gels for different WB).</p>

<p>See: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/4115/do-fluorescent-lighting-and-shutter-speed-create-a-problem-with-color-cast/4141#4141"">Do fluorescent lighting and shutter speed create a problem with color cast?</a></p>

<p>The key point here is that in addition to getting a flash, you need some method of triggering the flash so you can use it off camera. Fortunately the prices of portable radio triggers has fallen and reliability has risen significantly. It's just something else you need to factor in cost wise.</p>

<p>With the exception of one shot, the above images were all shot with a fully manual Vivtar 285. The only thing you get from a more expensive flash is automatic TTL metering. But you don't really need that, part of the learning curve is figuring out how to set the flash power. Plus it's usually less fiddly to just shoot a few test shots and dial in the power, than it is to get a full metering radio setup and mess around with the ratios. I would look at something like the Lumopro LP160, it has everything you need for off camera flash, nothing you don't need and it's cheap.</p>

<p>But when I zoom in it gets pixelated. I would assume the total opposite. I thought a 4K picture would provide much better zoom capability than a standard DSLR picture or even a mobile phone picture for that matter. If I zoom in on that picture it looks like it was taken using a 10-year-old mobile phone.</p>

<p>What is wrong with what I am expecting or doing? I don't know how to explain the disappointment, but I do know that it's me missing something.</p>

<p>I am looking at the pic at 1600×900 resolution on a 17-inch notebook, if that matters. The picture itself is 3840×2160.</p>
","<p>4K might be the next big thing in video, but for still photography that's just 8 megapixels, which is quite low for most cameras, and I think around the resolution of the iPhone. I have a Nikon D5300 with 24MP resolution, and I've seen other DSLRs get up to 36MP or higher. </p>

<p>And no matter what, if you zoom in enough, you will eventually get pixelation (anything over 100% will look blocky), that's just the nature of digital. Make sure that you judge the picture by looking at it from the intended distance and at the intended zoom level. Rarely will you look at a picture at 100% size on a monitor, and prints are typically viewed at a distance, vary rarely will someone take a magnifying glass to it. </p>

<p>It is possible that the .jpg compression is done at a low quality (high compression), which can create blocky artifacts (say 8px by 8px blocks) that look very similar to a pixelated picture. Using less compression (higher quality) will help, but increase the file size (that is the point of jpeg, after all!)</p>

<p>And no resolution will make up for a blurry or out of focus picture. That's often a bigger problem than the megapixel size. The law of diminishing returns really becomes significant as more pixels are crammed onto a sensor. </p>

<p><strong>The most important thing is that it must be completely clean</strong> and untreated by any chemicals. Cloths used in gloves or jackets often has water resistant coatings which may not be liked be the lens. The main reason for not using a sleeve is that it may contain grit which would damage the lens. If you really have to, use the inside of the sleeve.</p>

<p><strong>One really good option is to use lens tissues</strong> which are disposed after each use. They usually come in small packs of 100 sheets for a few dollars. Otherwise, usually microfiber or lint-free cloths will do. By buying one described as being for lenses (the kind that goes on a camera or in your face) you are quite certain to have the right kind.</p>

"Is there a way to charge a battery while still in the camera?","24168","","<p>I have a Canon DSLR 1000D (but don't feel limited to that) and I would like to have it charging automatically while turned off, without having to remove the battery from the body.</p>

<p>That is while I have access to power (wall AC etc.).</p>

<p>Anyone knows of a related solution/hack?</p>
","<ul>
<li>Is there a way to charge a battery while still in the camera?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, it's definitely doable. It carries some risk but it's something I'd happily do if required.<br>
[My day job is an EE with much involvement with batteries and charging - having somebody who knows their stuff help on this would be ""a good idea""[tm]</p>

<p>Some cameras have DC input for a remote power pack - this may also provide in-camera charging BUT probably doesn't.</p>

<p>If the camera uses a standard Lithium Ion battery (as the Canon 1000D and just about every modern DLSR does) then it IS possible to charge the battery in camera ""safely enough"" if you can access the battery contacts.There are some safety issues but these may well be acceptable to you.</p>

<p>Gaining access to the contacts can be done by <a href=""https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=trepanning&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3V8jUYrdN8mpiAeSkYCgDg&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1097&amp;bih=617"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>trepanning</strong></a>*  (probably not desirable) or by running wires from the in camera contacts or by adding wires to the battery before it is inserted, If you use the same battery each time to do this then modifying the battery is probably the best solution.</p>

<p>The battery MAY have enough room for wires to be run along its outer surface, or copper tape with insulation as requisite, may be feasible. However, the easiest method would be to open the battery and add wires and connections and then bring the wires out of the battery at the best point. </p>

<p>If you are lucky you may be able to bring the wires out around the edge of the battery door without modification. A quick test with a Sony A77 shows it will work well, and a look at a Nikon D700 suggests its doable. I imagine it would work in most but not all cases. However, making a tidy hole on the edge of the battery door at an optimum point would be easy and acceptable to some but not all. Replacement doors probably only cost an arm and half a leg. </p>

<p>A standard charger COULD be used but a modified one would be a far better idea. Having some EE capability or asking someone who has would be a good idea. Having a ""4 wire"" battery connection for the 2 main wires would allow remote sensing of the voltage so that wiring drop (liable to be small) can be eliminated. Most batteries have 3 connections, with the 3rd used to access an internal thermistor temperature sensor and/or in other cases to talk to an internal intelligent device which assists battery management and allows them to charge more for batteries.</p>

<p>I'd be tempted to drop the maximum charge rate somewhat, and I'd want to take a good look at battery temperature rise and cooling aspects. If you are accessing the battery via the battery door the very enthused may wish to add a cooling air line. This would be an extremely easy thing to do, need not take up much room and may be worthwhile. </p>

<p>For extra points it may be psosible to detect when the battery is in use by the camera and be able to provide enough current to operate it fully or partially from the external supply. You do need to know when the camera is drawing current as it will draw several times the max permissible battery charge current in many cases - and you do not want the N times current going into the battery.</p>

<p>""Vent with flame"" is a know LiIon party trick and charging in-camera has the possibility of increasing this happening. That said, I have had a long and varied EE career and have never yet seen a LiIon battery incident or know anyone who has had one. </p>

<p>an alternative to the in-camera charging as above is to remove the battery from teh camera and to use an external battery near or just outside the camera proper. Your circumstances are unknown, but in most cases I'd expect your system to be stationary or tethered if your are doing external charging, so an external battery would probably be very acceptable. Again, having a competent EE as part of the project would be 'a good idea' [tm].</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>

<p>Additional question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you think there will be a problem having the camera turned on for a long time (more than months) but taking 10-20 photos a day?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd expect the camera would be OK in the N per day x Many Months mode.   </p>

<p>Depending on the latency that you can afford (and assuming that you have standby powerdown and wakeup on shutter half-pressure (as many DSLRs have))you may wish to let the camera go into standby then letting the camera go into standby after a while and waking it up with a half pressure activation prior to taking each shot is liable to cause less problems. Depending on the camera, wakeup from standby takes say 0.2s to several seconds. You could detect that it is awake by eg current draw or just wait a known long enough period for it to wake up.</p>

<p>Leaving it on all the time and not in standby may be OK but this is less usual and may affect life of displays or sensors - and may not. I'd expect it would be OK for most displays and hope it would be OK for most sensors. Most other electronic components will be happy enough. Modern DSLRs probably do not use aluminum electrolytic capacitors so their dry-out lifetime issues should not apply.</p>

<p>If I was doing this and wanted best battery lifetime I'd modify the charger so that it stopped charging completely when the battery reached say 4.1V/cell and cut back in again at say 4.0V/cell. This hold the battery at the ""knee"" between constant current charging (70% to 80% of capacity) and the constant voltage, declining current tail that adds maybe 20% more capacity. A battery has substantially longer life if operated in this way.</p>

","<p>From a <strong>functional</strong> standpoint, yes, you could essentially achieve the same effect with multiple stacked filters as a single high-density filter (say a 10-stopper.) There are a variety of concerns to be aware of, however, regarding stacking multiple filters.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Filter quality:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The Lee ""Big Stopper"" 10-stop ND filter is pretty high quality glass filter</li>
<li>There are two Lee <em>ProGlass</em> filters (0.6 and 0.9) of the same quality</li>
<li>The full range of standard Lee ND filters, (0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9) are resin</li>
<li>Many third-party filters are resin, a very few are glass (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Since this answer was posted, many more third-party manufacturers are using ""optical resin"" (CR-39) or optical glass for filters. They are expensive, but Lee is no longer the only good source of glass filters.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Color cast:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Stacking lots of resin filters can cause strange color casts</li>
<li>With digital, color cast is usually an easy post-process fix</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vignetting:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Stacking enough resin filters means a pretty thick hunk of junk on the end of the lens</li>
<li>At least four resin ND filters (0.3/1stop, 0.6/2, 0.9/3, 1.2/4) are needed to match a single 10-stop filter</li>
<li>On wider-angle lenses, you can barely get away with two stacked filters let alone four without vignetting</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flaring:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Any additional optical device added to the light path adds the potential for flare and ghosting</li>
<li>Stacking four ND filters adds a total of 8 additional surfaces which can reflect</li>
<li>To my knowledge, no 4x4/100mm filters are multicoated, so their chances of flaring/ghosting are high</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> 

<ul>
<li>A single 10-stop filter still leaves you some room to also stack on a graduated ND filter to balance contrast</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to do some serious ND work, such as 5 minute exposures of sunset along the coast, you should get a 10-stop filter. You'll probably also need at least one GND to normalize scene contrast if you are photographing a sunset/sunrise, which would usually require a setup like the Lee base filter kit with a tandem adapter and an additional independent filter holder (for a total of up to 8 filters)...that is pretty much guaranteed to add vignetting on anything other than a telephoto lens.</p>

"How would one remove yellow eyes instead of red eyes?","24040","","<p>On a recent trip to Madagascar, we were able to capture some interesting animals during the night, where of course we used flash. The following photo is not made by me...</p>

<p>How do I generate good visual maps of what changed without tedious custom software programing? </p>
","<p>Photoshop + Layers FTW. (yes, you can also use the Gimp, or any other editing software with the same functions.)</p>

<p>Start with your base image, in the case above, I used the jpeg quality 100 image.</p>

<ol>
<li>create a new layer atop it</li>
<li>paste the second image into that layer</li>
<li>set the layer style to ""difference""</li>
<li>create an effect layer atop that</li>
<li>set the effect to threshold</li>
<li>set the threshold value to 1</li>
</ol>

<p>In the resulting image, any pixel that is any any way different between the two images will be white. You can adjust it to allow things to be ""a little different"" by altering the threshold value.</p>

<p>Example showing a LOT of difference between jpeg 92 and 100 from Lightroom.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0YN2.jpg"" alt=""comparing jpeg 92 and 100 from LR with photoshop layers""></p>

<p>Example showing no difference at all between 95 and 100.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzEaH.jpg"" alt=""comparing jpeg 95 and 100 from LR with photoshop layers""></p>

<p>Not that's just showing a binary ""changed or not"", what if you wanted more detail on how much it changed, say by color channel?</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace the threshold adjustment layer with a curves adjustment layer.</li>
<li>edit the curve</li>
<li>turn on show clipping</li>
<li>grab the input white handle below the lower right corner and drag it over to the left, as far as you can go</li>

<li>turn clipping back off and save the curve change</li>
</ol>

<p>The brighter the resulting pixels, the more they're different in that color. The downside though is you end up with a lot of grey mud... so sometimes it's easier to just threshold it to see where differences are. That's why I build both and toggle which one is visible.</p>

<p>Can I use my video camera with its standard screw-in tripod mount with a GoPro mount?</p>
","<p>GoPro cameras do not have a built in tripod mount(1/4-20). <strong>They actually have a more specialized quick release clip built into the waterproof housing.

Imagine a foggy atmosphere, with a lighting nightmare: everything from strobe lights to colored spotlights and everything in between, both bright and dark. The atmosphere is very fast-paced.</p>

<p>I'm looking for tips on lenses, ISO settings, camera settings (I have a Nikon D90 if that helps), since this is such a difficult atmosphere, I want to go in at least having some sort of plan.</p>
","<p>It's at times like this that digital photography really out-shines anything you could ever do with film... because you're going to get a lot of missed shots.</p>

<p>Here's a strategy that's worked for me in the past: Get an external flash <em>with TTL</em> (very important) and an off camera cable. A mid-ranged zoom will be fine, it doesn't even have to be a good one, you're going to be shooting at f/5.6 or f/8 anyway. Don't use a 50mm on your D90, it's going to be too long. If you can get a flash bracket, that'd be even better. I know it looks a bit ridiculous, but putting the light off the camera is a god-send quality wise AND it will signal to the club goers that you are a serious photographer, not just some creep with a camera. That actually does make a big difference in how they react to you.</p>

<p>To start shooting, set your camera to Manual mode, What you want to do is to get up close with your subject, but keep the in the night club context. You don't need high ISO to do this, 400 will be more than enough. Drag the shutter a bit, 1/30 or 1/15 and keep your aperture around f/5.6-f/8, that should be more than enough with a crop sensor. This will let you freeze your subject (speedlites shoot at up to 1/10000s) while getting enough ambient light to keep them in a club setting. I'd stay on the wide-end of your focal range, that puts the viewer ""in the middle of things"", using longer focal lengths makes them feel like they're looking at something happening far away.</p>

<p>Resist chimping after getting the first few shots, spend time in the club shooting, you'll get a chance to check it all later. Shoot extra, you never know if someone shut their eyes. Just get in, pop pop pop, get out. Bring extra batteries. You might not be able to AF because the club might be just too dark, but if you shoot people from more or less the same distance at f/8 you probably won't need to.</p>

<p>Cool effects I've seen used: wide angles (10-22) with the flash set to a longer distance, that lights just the middle of the frame while creating a cool fall-off around it. Multiple exposures to tell a story in a single frame.</p>

<p>Oh, and do what Michael Bolli said - test it out on your friends at home first, but to be honest it's a pretty easy for of photography to get right. Concentrate on getting interesting looking people and situations over the technique tho, because nobody's going to care if a shot isn't perfectly lit as long as the content is great.</p>

"Do I need a full-frame camera for low-light photography?","23738","","<p>I primarily shoot low-light photos, and I upgraded from a point-and-shoot to the Sony NEX-5R (which has an APS-C sensor) a few months back.</p>

<p>However, I find that the low-light performance of the NEX-5R is not as good as I'd like. I find myself shooting at ISO 400 or lower, with a tripod, even at f/2.8 (I do have an f/1.8 lens, too).</p>

<p>I was wondering if I should upgrade to a full-frame camera. I'm told that there's only a one-stop difference between a full-frame and an APS-C sensor, which doesn't seem like much. For example, this is a 13-second exposure on my NEX (at ISO 100): </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJtkX.jpg"" alt=""13-second exposure""></p>

<p>With a one-stop advantage on a full-frame sensor, I'd still need a 6.5-second exposure at ISO 200, to maintain the same quality. Even if it were a .65-second exposure, I'd still need a tripod, in which case I might as well use an APS-C sensor and give it a few more seconds.</p>

<p>Am I correct in understanding that for me, full-frame provides a negligible advantage at a high price? Thanks.</p>
","<p>Short answer: some full-frame cameras will offer a distinct advantage in noise levels if you must freeze action with high shutter speeds at high ISO settings (above, say 1600). So, unless you are shooting sports or other fast moving subjects in marginal light, there's little practical advantage with a full-frame sensor. Stressing ""practical.""</p>

<p>Longer answer: Resolution is irrelevant. 20 MPs, for example, record the same amount of detail, regardless of the sensor size. Full-frame sensors are not inherently sharper than sub-full frame sensors. 20 MPs are 20 MPs. Each records the same amount of detail and displays the same amount of sharpness.</p>

<p>Of course, you can squeeze more pixels onto a larger sensor. There are plenty of reasons to want or need that kind of resolution, but there are always a trade-offs. Operating speed (Even the best camera technology can't process a 40MP image as fast as it can a 20MP image). You need more computing power to efficiently process image files at that size, both at capture and in post-processing. You need more storage. While pros often have clients who want these large files, most practical uses are going to require massive downsizing. It's great to have all that information, but most of it is going to be thrown away 99% of the time because most forms of display don't require it. </p>

<p>It's true that full-frame sensors can record a broader dynamic and tonal range, and more color depth, if you are shooting RAW files. However, the human eye can only discern about 10 million different colors. While RAW files offer more flexibility for tweaking images in post processing to avoid posterization, images – ultimately – need to be crunched down to 8-bits for display. So saving an image in any more than 8 bits is excessive if the only intended purpose is for viewing. Also remember that file bit-depth and display bit-depth are expressed differently. An 8-bit image file is actually displayed at 24 bpp (8-bits per pixel/channel, for RGB).</p>

<p>So, in the end, unless you shoot action in low light, or you need the ability to finely control which colors and tones will ultimately be expressed in the final 8-bit image for display, there is little-to-no advantage to a full frame sensor over AP-C (all other things – like resolution, the camera's image processor, lenses, exposure settings, etc. – being equal).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Portrait photography produces pictures that capture the personality of a subject by using effective lighting, backdrops, and poses. A portrait picture might be artistic, or it might be clinical, as part of a medical study. Frequently, portraits are commissioned for special occasions, such as weddings or school events. Portraits can serve many purposes, from usage on a personal Web site to display in the lobby of a business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can find other more or less ""official"" definitions of portrait photography, but this one captures several aspects that are important to portrait photography (or to portraiture in the visual arts overall) which may not be explained in detail in a general-purpose dictionary. </p>

<p>A portrait:</p>

<ul>
<li>Captures the personality or essence of a subject. Not just a picture with a person in it. A ""clinical"" portrait might not attempt to reveal the <em>soul</em> of a person, but it still needs to capture something of that person's uniqueness — or else it's not a portrait.</li>
<li>Is staged. While portraits <em>can</em> be candid, even those tend to have some intentionality. The lighting, backdrops, and poses are important, even if they are ad hoc. (Or maybe <em>especially</em> when they are.)</li>
<li>Is commissioned. While this isn't necessary in a literal sense, in a larger sense portrait photographs are <em>made for the purpose</em>. Someone — the subject, or the artist, or some organization — wants a portrayal of a certain person (or group of people). Even a street portrait of a stranger can fit, based on the photographer's intention.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the very existence of the term ""group portrait"", clearly such a thing exists. One can also say ""individual portrait"", but generally the implication of the term alone is that a single person is portrayed. However, if there are multiple subjects — the grandmother and granddaughter, for example — the picture isn't automatically a portrait without some of the above.</p>

<p>A successful photograph of a grandmother and granddaughter might be thought of as two portraits in one: first, a portrait of the grandmother, showing her personality through her relationship to the child; second and simultaneously, a portrait of the granddaughter, showing <em>her</em> personality through her relationship with the older woman.</p>

<p>A lesser photograph might succeed at just one of these, being effectively a portrait of one person with the other person as a prop. Or, if the focus is on the <em>activity</em> of the two subjects, or on their surroundings, it's probably not really a portrait.</p>

"Should I store my 35mm rolls in the fridge?","23586","","<p>I have bought a bunch of 35mm film canisters (24 and 36 exposure canisters, no bulk rolls). They are new films (Expiration date sometime in 2016), but I won't be using them all immediately.</p>

<p>My apartment generally has a temperature of ~72 degrees F, but on hot days it can go up to 80.</p>

<p>I heard that storing film in the fridge or freezer prolongs its life greatly, but people also caution because of condensation. Most threads I've seen revolve around bulk rolls however.</p>

<p>For canisters, should I store them in the fridge to make sure to maintain the best quality/life expectancy even if it may take a year before I finally use them?</p>
","<p>It depends on the type of film and on your post processing. </p>

<p>For black and white films there is no need to cool them at all. When they mature well beyond their expiration date, they might get a bit slower if at all. </p>

<p>It is different for colour emulsions. The three or four colour ""layers"" may mature at different speed which may then result in unwanted colour shift, while a minor change to the overall speed of the film may not matter that much, similar to b&amp;w. </p>

<p>For colour negatives, you could still correct minor colour shifts with your enlarger or have that automatically done in the lab where it is typically done for free anyway. </p>

<p>For slides it is different though. A slide is a slide with no chance of corrections due to the absence of any post processing. (Unless you plan to scan them or enlarge them on reverse paper or so.) The slide itself cannot be corrected in terms of speed (density) and colour. Slides should be kept cold when stored for some years. </p>

<p>And then there are the pro films. Pro films are typically used when ever very constant results in ever repeating processes are required. Such as Portraits in Photo Booth etc., where the operator is not even necessarily well trained. In order to keep constantly reliable results it is strongly recommended storing them at constantly cool temperatures, preferably in dry environments. No need to freeze them either. </p>

<p>Obviously, I'm talking only about cameras with a mechanical shutter. My camera is a Canon 550D but I assume this will be the same for every camera make and model.</p>

"Does a ""body-only"" DSLR need a lens added before use?","23281","","<p>What does it mean for a DSLR camera to be described as ""body-only""?  I found one advertised for sale that was described as such, and I don't know if I'll need to add a lens.  I assume that it means either that the camera is used without attaching an external lens, or that the camera is sold without a lens but and will need to have one added.</p>

<p>If it needs no additional lens, like a regular digital camera, what is its focal length likely to be?</p>
","<p>A body can capture an image without a lens, but it will most likely be shades of black/grey/white (depending of light source available and shutter speed).</p>

<p>No lens = no focal length = no ""mm""</p>

<p>The reason why there are 'body-only' cameras are because camera bodies (and lesnes) get upgraded. So, if you have a lens that you really like, you can use it on a new camera body. Also, if a new lens comes out, you can use it on your body. But don't think that any lens with fit and/or work with it. There are different mounts and even same brands have different mounts.</p>

<p>I understand how sensor size would relate to, for example, field of view, but the relationship with depth of field does not seem straightforward.</p>

<p>It actually seems contradictory - <strong>I have more wells on my sensor, and I am able to focus on less number of points</strong>.</p>

<p>What is the reason for this effect?</p>
","<p>Firstly, the number of wells on the sensor has no bearing on where you can focus or 'how much' you can focus on. Out of focus light is still light hitting the sensor.</p>

<p>Simply put, you have shallower depth of field with a full-frame sensor because you have to get closer to the subject (or zoom in) in order to fill the frame. Note that in your example it says <em>same composition</em>: the camera has been moved or the focal length changed in order to fill the frame with the bottle.</p>

<p>To put it another way, if you fix a tripod in place and take a shot with an APS-C camera with the bottle filling the frame, then take the same shot in exactly the same position with a full-frame camera, you will have more space around the bottle. So you will either need to zoom in or move the camera closer to achieve the same shot where the bottle fills the frame, either of which will alter the depth of field, </p>

"How to read ND filter description?","23115","","<p>When I search on Amazon for eg. <code>neutral density 67mm</code>, I get long list of different filters. Some of them are marked like: ND2, ND4, ND8 etc. I'm guessing this means 2-, 4- or 8-stops filter, am I right? <br/>
But what about filters, that say 0.6 or 0.9? What does this mean? </p>

<p>Is there any other thing (apart of stops and diameter) that I should also pay attention to when choosing a filter? </p>
","<p>The number associated with an ND filter is actually the denominator (bottom) of a fraction.</p>

<p>So an ND2 filter should be thought of as 1/2 the amount of light being allowed through the filter. For example, setting the lens at f/2.8, and using an ND2 filter would make that an f/4 situation for a total of 1 stop difference.</p>

<p>ND4 filter is allowing 1/4 the light (which is half of ND2) thus a 2 stop difference.</p>

<p>Continuing, ND8 is 1/8 and three stops and, although I've never seen them, an ND16 is half as much light as ND8 so would be four stops less light.</p>

<p>The decimal numbers you mention (0.6, 0.9) are another system of quantifying the density of the ND filter. These numbers are the log (base 10) of the factor by which the light is reduced. (This is sometimes called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">absorbance</a>). So for example a 1 stop filter reduces the amount of light by a factor of 2, and log(2) = 0.3 so a 1 stop ND filter is ND0.3 in this system. Similarly 2 stops is 0.6 and 3 stops is 0.9. The combined effect of multiple filters is obtained by adding up the numbers. For example a 1 stop, 2 stop and 3 stop filter combined (6 stops in total) would be 0.3 + 0.6 + 0.9 = log(2^6) = log(64) = log(2) + log(4) + log(8) = ND1.8.</p>

<p>I would highly suggest the best quality GLASS filters you can afford. Cheaper (especially plastic) filters will tend to add nasty color effects. Although technically color casts can be corrected in post, cheap filters also can also reduce the quality of light meaning things like more chromatic aberation.</p>

<p>Lastly, don't worry about getting the highest ND number, I carry two filters around and stack them together, when needed, for combined affect. Which is more reason why quality filters matter as stacking simply magnifies imperfections too!</p>

I have also tried changing lenses, but the problem is the same.</p>

<p>This points to the problem almost certainly being in the camera body. The lens contacts are clean, the lenses were correctly fitted and it was bright enough to autofocus.</p>

<p>Currently I have no ideas other than a faulty shutter release button, broken circuitry (unlikely), or some bizzare instant-burnout of the lenses' AF motors.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> in the camera setting, switch the auto focus ""on""</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> in the camera setting , set the focus mode to ""continuous mode"" </p>

<p>if these options are all right, then your camera must be able to auto focus.
but if not then there definitely may be a shutter release problem as you said.</p>

<p>just check if the shutter release actually works or not. ? is it able to shoot a photo (in manual focus)</p>

"Is it worth buying a battery grip for my camera?","23000","","<p>Recently I heard that a battery grip can enhance the feel of the camera in my hands especially if it's an entry DSLR, and besides, some people claim that it enhances the stability of the camera if you are trying to put it on a table or something. </p>

<p>So I started to look for a battery grip for my <strong>Canon 600D</strong> and found the Canon's one to be almost $150. So is it worth it to spend this money on the battery grip? I'm not interested in buying an extra battery because I don't find myself with the problem of empty battery. </p>

<p>What would be the advantages or disadvantages of the brand grip versus third party grips should I ultimately desire to get additional batteries?</p>
","<p>About 6 months after buying my 7D, I got the associated battery grip for it, and my feelings on it are mixed...</p>

<p>As others have said, at times, the duplicated buttons for portrait orientation can come in extremely handy.  Not only do they allow you to operate the camera in portrait mode without craning an arm over to reach the normal buttons, but because of this, you will maintain a much much steadier grip for stability.</p>

<p>Another positive aspect is that the additional 'bulk' of it, really balances out any larger lenses that you may use. This is especially noticable with telephoto lenses such as the 100-400L, or any 200mm+ primes.  </p>

<p>Having room for 2 batteries is also fantastic - I know you said you didn't have this problem, but for me, if I'm at an airshow for example, I know and have confidence that I can shoot all day, and fill my memory cards well before I have any issues with batteries dying.  Also, if caught in a pinch, the battery grip allows you to use AA batteries to power your camera too.</p>

<p>So, the pros are that it allows easier, steadier camera use in portrait orientation, balances the camera well, and gives you longer shooting time with an additional battery.</p>

<p><em>However...</em></p>

<p>Most of the time, in normal every day shooting, where I just want to head out with the camera, I will take the grip off.  I'll take my 24mm and 50mm lenses only, and camera with no grip, and ""go light"".  After any amount of time using the 7D with grip which is a fairly weightly bit of kit; to take it off and have only the basic body with one prime lens (especially the 50!) is so refreshing and almost empowering.  It encourages me to take it out when sometimes if it had the grip on, I may not.</p>

<p>So... there are pros and cons.  I'd say to summarise that it's DEFINITELY worth having one, even if you only find yourself using it occasionally.  </p>

It seems that this lighting is a bit much for people.</p>

<p>What is the correct temperature for shooting people in an indoor room? I also have some nasty, yellow soft-white (2300k?) and halogen lights.</p>
","<p>The problem with fluorescent lighting isn't the color temperature, exactly. You can generally adjust white balance to account for that. If there's a green tint, that can usually be compensated for with <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10319/when-should-i-use-manual-white-balance-settings"">manual white balance</a>. But the poor color rendering is harder.</p>

<p>The problem is that by their nature fluorescent tubes only produce light in narrow ranges of wavelengths (depending on the composition of the gasses and phosphors used). Since colors in objects are in a sense only actually <em>there</em> if the matching wavelength of light can be reflected back into your eyes or camera, this means fluorescent lighting flattens color in weird ways.</p>

<p>This is one of those cases where the human vision system's magical qualities run us into trouble. Your brain adjusts for this so quickly that you don't really notice unless you've got a reference light source to compare to. (There's a cool little exhibit on this at the Museum of Science in Boston, if you're ever in my area.)</p>

<p>""Full spectrum"" bulbs use a combination of gasses to cover more spectrum. But even then, it tends to be spiky and weird, not the wide incandescence of, say, the sun (or a traditional light bulb). Many fluorescent bulbs list something called CRI, or ""Color Rendering Index"". This isn't perfect — I don't think it's regulated, and it appears to be determined by each manufacturer, not independently. And the process / standard could stand to be updated to an <a href=""http://www.knt.vein.hu/staff/schandaj/SJCV-Publ-2005/521.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">approach using more rigorous scientific understanding</a>. But, it's what we've got.</p>

"Compact vs Mirrorless - why pick one over another?","22528","","<p>What would be a reason for one to pick the compact (whatever it'd be P&amp;S or something more advanced) over mirrorless compact system camera  ?</p>

<p>Right now market is quite confusing — we have huge market of tiny-sensor compacts, we have mirrorless that use sensors in a size of these from P&amp;S cameras (Nikon 1 being notable example), we have compacts with sensors bigger than most popular mirrorless system (Canon G1X vs m4/3), we have lot of APS-C sensor mirrorless which are matched by some of the compacts (Fuji X100 being most notable example, but even Leica has its X2),  and to make it even more confusing — Sony released RX1 with full frame sensor, beating crap out of every mirrorless on a market.</p>

<p>So what are your arguments to pick compact over a mirrorless?</p>

<p>Why are they better, what's the reason behind logic of companies like Fujifilm which at the same time offers P&amp;S and X-mount mirrorless using same sensor size?</p>
","<p>Absolutely, there are good reasons to choose a compact camera, just like there are good reasons to choose a mirrorless. The key when looking at anything is <em>deciding which reasons are important to you</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: A compact camera is, well, compact. A mirrorless camera's body may be compact but once you add a lens, it will often be double the thickness of a compact. Plus, the lens does not retract into the body as with <em>most</em> compact cameras.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: A compact camera is an all-in-one package. Sure this takes away versatility but you do not have to worry about sensor dust or spend time changing lenses. <em>This is the reason I believe we are seeing and will be seeing much more larger-sensor compacts.</em></li>
<li><strong>Optimization</strong>: When a camera and lens are designed together they can be optimized far more, either to give higher-quality (which a large-sensor of course) or better optical performance such as a brighter aperture.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: There is saving in providing a camera and lens together, compared to something equivalent, obviously.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Personally I agree that this makes the market more difficult because there are now more compromises to deal with then ever. It is much harder to find one camera which is better in most respects than another. In the end, every type of camera is surpassed in some key area by another. It can be surprising and frustrating to realize this.</em></p>

"How should I photograph falling snow?","22425","","<p>We don't get much snow in the UK, so I don't have much experience photographing it, and when I tried photographing falling snow last year I found it very hard to capture the snowflakes in the air — they either didn't show up or were just streaks. Is there a shutter speed that is best for this? I don't want to use flash to do so.</p>

<p>Any other snow photography tips welcome from those in snowier places!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Here's a couple of shots that I got when I tried the techniques suggested. These were taken with a Panasonic Lumix G1, 14-45 lens at about 25mm (50mm equiv),  pop up flash, a plastic bag and an elastic band (to keep the camera dry).

","<p>If you want them to stand out against the background, you need to use a flash. On-axis will generally reflect the most light off the snowflakes to the camera and have them stand out more. I used a cheap eBay plastic cover with a space for the flash for the picture below. Otherwise, a fast shutter speed may make them visible, but it depends on the background and the lighting. You would need some bright sun but a dark shaded background.</p>

"How do selfie sticks integrate with digital cameras?","22360","","<p>I want to understand how a selfie stick works with Digital Cameras.</p>

connected to, is this right ?</li>
<li>If yes, will the selfie stick button work with the digital camera connected via tripod mount ?</li>
<li>Also some selfie sticks have remote bluetooth shutter, will this also work with
camera ?</li>
<li>Or there is another mechanism than the mechanism used by selfie stick with Iphone/Android/Smartphone cameras? Using timers instead for example?! I don't know.</li>
</ul>

<p>Could anyone explain how selfie stick works with digital cameras (connection and taking shots)?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, selfie sticks are manufactured with very different designs one from another and with very wide range of standards (i.e. you can get worthless garbage or overbuilt luxury), so it is highly difficult to know all possible connection/activation mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Use with smartphones</strong></p>

<p>A huge number of s. sticks are made for smartphones, meaning that most of them wont have a tripod-like mount, but some sort of adapter to fit a phone directly. Since a lot of phones with a camera also have bluetooth capability, there are some sticks that have a bluetooth shutter button that you should ""connect"" with your phone and you shuld be ready.</p>

<p>Some phones (at least the iPhone) can use the button on the headphones as a shutter, so, some sticks have a button wired with a headphone plug.</p>

<p>There are also bluetooth shutters sold independently (not as part of a stick). You could glue, velcro or tape one of these if you can only find a stick that doesn't have an integrated shutter.</p>

<p><strong>Using with cameras</strong></p>

<p>There are some sticks that do have a tripod like mount and almost any camera, even point and shoot, have a tripod screw receptacle. </p>

<p>If you are lucky, you may find a stick like these that also includes the phone to tripod adapter. Such adapters or mounts are also available by separate.</p>

<p>However, not every camera has the remote shutter function. Some may have a remote shutter port, but this is usually the case only with bigger DSLRs that are unpractical to use on a stick. Some compact cameras may have this port though.</p>

<p>Other cameras may have an infra red sensor to accept a remote control. This remote control can usually be bought from the manufacturer but some ""generic"" controls may work with some cameras. (I doubt a stick with i.r. shutter is to be found, so, if this where the only option for my camera, I'd tape or velcro the remote control to the stick).</p>

<p>Some cameras may have the functionality to be remotely controlled via wifi, bluetooth or other, and in some cases that means a smart phone app exists for that. However, controlling a camera stick with one hand and a smart phone on the other may prove unpractical, I'd just use the phone directly.</p>

<p>In any case, you should refer to your camera's user manual. If the camera has some remote shutter function, the manual should have at least one short section describing it. You can also look at the ""optional accessories"" list. If there is a remote shutter, then you camera is likely to have the function.</p>

<p>Finally, there are some sticks that have a mechanical remote shutter, that is, a mechanical contraption where a remote lever, brace, clamp, whatever... presses the actual camera's shutter button. This option may have limited compatibility due to the different camera designs and sizes.</p>

<p>If there is no remote shutter for your camera, or you don't want to pay the outrageous price they may ask for it, then you are left with one last option: the timer shutter release. Many cameras have a function to delay the actual shooting for anything from 2-15 seconds. That should be enough to press the button on the camera and re-position the stick.</p>

"What are jpeg artifacts and what can be done about them?","22265","","<p>I know JPEG is a ""lossy"" compression algorithm that discards information in order to save space. What is the visual impact of this? I've heard of ""JPEG artifacts"". What do these look like?</p>

<p>Are there situations where the same level of compression creates more artifacts and looks worse? Does the content of the image matter at all? What does the algorithm handle well, and what does it have trouble with?</p>

<p>Assuming JPEG is a requirement, is there a way to reduce artifacts? If I'm uploading to a web service which will apply its own compression outside of my control, is there anything I can do to the image in advance to make it survive this better?</p>
","<h3>An example</h3>

<p>Using the current photo of the week image. This is the high-quality JPEG:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGgOm.jpg"" alt=""gimp Q=99""></p>

<p>re-saved in Gimp with JPEG quality 80 (low); please note the general loss of sharpness, ""dots"" around high-contrast edges, loss of detail in low-contrast areas:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h6Jcy.jpg"" alt=""gimp Q=80""></p>

<p>and re-saved in GIMP with JPEG quality 30 (very low); please note evident 8x8 blocks and severe loss of sharpness and color detail:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2tyF.jpg"" alt=""gimp Q=30""></p>

<h3>Three kinds of distortions</h3>

<p>JPEG tends to introduce two three kinds of distortions:</p>

<ul>
<li>general loss of sharpness and oscillations around high-contrast edges: these are due to approximating intensity transitions with smooth functions (cosines); you see them as small ""dots"" or ""halos"" around the edges; they are particularly easy to see in the images of text of hand-drawings.</li>
<li>blocking structure: image is processed separately for every 8x8 block (or bigger in case of chroma downsampling), block edges become visible at high compression ratios.</li>
<li>loss of color detail: it depends on saving parameters, the program may aggressively ""downsample"" (reduce resolution of) chromaticity channels; it is rarely an issue for the natural photography.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visible block structure and halos around edges are usually referred to as JPEG artifacts. Let's zoom in our example to see them better. From left to right, a crop from the original, JPEG Q80 and JPEG Q30 images. I marked artifacts in green (circles for halos, and dots for 8x8 blocks):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJC2d.png"" alt=""three-way compare""></p>

<p>As any information loss, you cannot actually recover it. Sharpening may help to recover lost edge contrast, but makes ""halos"" more evident; denoising may help to remove ""halos"", but reduces sharpness even further. If block structure is visible, it is probably too late. Just keep the original high-resolution, high-quality images around, and don't overwrite them.</p>

<h3>Hosting strategies</h3>

<p>If you control JPEG compression parameters and want to maximize image quality:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep the compression ratio as low as you can (use high-quality settings)</li>
<li>consider downsampling chromaticity channels (it may be almost unnoticeable for some images, and allows for lower compression ratio in the luminosity channel given the same file size constraint)</li>
<li>consider using floating-point discrete cosine transform (it may increase precision of the transform, but file saving will take longer)</li>
<li>consider using lower resolution instead of higher compression ratio (given the same bound on the file size)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you upload to a third-party service, and don't control compression parameters, you cannot do much about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a service which is known to prefer high-quality JPEG (Flickr, SmugMug, 23hq, 500px) over services which are known to over-compress to save traffic (Picasa, Imgur, Dropbox); usually you get what you pay for.</li>
<li>try resizing photos yourself and uploading the right size (some services will re-compress it anyway, some may serve your file as uploaded)</li>

"How to photograph glass without reflections and shadows?","22258","","<p>I'm working on Image processing issue and I need to take picture from automotive glass.the camera is mounted at top and the glass lays down at the bottom. I put a black textile at the back of glass .
the main problem is how can I cancel reflection of camera image into the glass? how should I light the object to give best result and have no shadow and reflection of near objects?
thanks</p>
","<p>When you have a reflective surface like glass, the angle of incidence of the light equals the angle of reflection.  So if the light comes from 45 degrees from the right, it will reflect back 45 to the left. If it's directly over the glass, it will reflect straight back (at the camera then).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QF2ue.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reflection_angles.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reflection_angles.svg</a></p>

<p>So you want your lights far enough to the sides that you cannot see that reflection (I'd use at least two lights, one on either side).  In the figure above, if P is your light source, the light will reflect off the glass to Q.  If the camera is in the middle (where it says ""normal"") it will not see the glare of the reflection (this assume a narrow beam of light- with larger lights, rather than one narrow line between P and Q there is a much wider band of light.</p>

<p>In order to remove the reflection of your camera, as James Youngman said, a polarising filter will reduce it.  To eliminate it you want to do one (or both) of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Move the camera slightly off-axis if you can, so that it's not exactly overhead.  Using the same angle of incidence/reflection, the reflection of the camera will not come straight back up into the camera.  Like moving to the side of a mirror until you can't see your reflection.  This can cause perspective problems however</p></li>
<li><p>The other solution is do this work in a dark place.  Illuminate your subject with lights that have grids, snoots, or barn doors to focus the light on the subject, so that your camera does not get light on it.  If it is in the dark it will be invisible.  You can use black cards or fabric to keep the light from illuminating the camera.</p></li>
<li><p>You could also fashion a black board with a hole in it for your lens.  Stick the lens through and take your photos.  The reflection will then be of a black surface with a small, dark round hole, which may not show up, or can more easily be edited out in post processing</p></li>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y7UTx.jpg"" alt=""Flash Diffuser Picture""></p>

<p>So, what are the effects of a light diffuser like this one? What difference does it make to the resulting photo? And, when should I use it?</p>

<p>Is it useful for on-camera flash? How does it compare to bouncing the flash?</p>

<p>Is it useful for off-camera flash? When should I use it as opposed to the other 10,000 light modifiers out there?</p>

<p>Or, is it just one of those things where its only purpose in life is being an easy up-sell?</p>
","<p>This kind of flash diffuser produces a ""bare-bulb"" effect. It's not like a softbox or umbrella, which works by effectively making a larger light source. Instead, it makes the light from your flash less focused, so it's diffused by bouncing off walls and other objects.</p>

<p>Normally, a hotshoe flash works like a spotlight — it focuses its output in a cone. That's good for efficiency, but makes the light rather uni-directional and harsh. A bare bulb, on the other hand, scatters light in every direction. From the point of view of a subject, it's still one source, but the scattered light also bounces around the room, providing softer fill light.</p>

<p>Many people try to use this type of push-on diffuser to improve the appearance of flash when shooting in large spaces or outdoors. <em>This will lead to disappointment.</em> The little bit of plastic doesn't do much but cut light output in this case.</p>

<p>The Sto-Fen Omnibounce is one of the more popular brand-name pieces of push-on plastic, and they have a <a href=""http://www.stofen.com/info/howitworks.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagram of the effect</a> on their website. Note the bouncing arrows — that's critical, even though they don't really explain that every well.</p>

<p>Of course, a real bare-bulb (also called ""bare tube"") flash just doesn't have a focusing reflector in the first place. This is a lot more effective than having the reflector and sticking a little white plastic box on top. I'm not aware of any hotshoe units made to work this way (short of somewhat-dangerous D.I.Y.),  but many studio lights (<a href=""http://www.adorama.com/QTQFT5DR.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a>) are made to easily support this configuration. Notice the 45° angle suggested in the Sto-Fen diagram — that's basically a compromise because the small push-on thing isn't big enough to really scatter light everywhere. Devices like Gary Fong's ""<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/19750/gary-fong-collapsable-on-nikon-sb600-flash-is-folding"">Lightsphere</a>"" are meant to provide a bigger ""bulb emulator"".</p>

<p>I think the push-on diffusers for hotshoe flashes are <em>mostly a gimmick</em>, but they do have some use. When you're bouncing from the ceiling, sometimes light is still too directional and you get unwanted downward shadows. Since we normally expect light like that, that's better than shadows on the wall and otherwise sideways — but using this device will scatter some more light around to bounce in more directions (including directly, of course).</p>

In general, if a lens uses the same mount, it should be basically compatible, though some features may not work.

Similarly, some older Nikon lenses can't focus on newer camera bodies that lack a focus motor built in to the camera.</p>

I know that there are some people who have been in the game for years upon years, and to them they can notice the difference between photos taken with manual vs auto settings, but for my situation, do you think it really makes a difference? Is my camera smart enough to determine the best settings for me?</p>

<p>Also, lets say manual settings are better (which I'm sure they are, since they give you greater control). How often are you supposed to adjust your settings? Between every shot, considering they are unique shots? Or does it not matter about the object, but rather the lighting environment? So if I'm in a forest at 2:00 PM on a sunny bright day and I take photos for one hour, should I be constantly adjusting my settings between every unique shot to get the best out of it? Or do I usually just find one setting that works for the environment I'm in?</p>

"Disadvantages of electronic first curtain shutter?","22071","","<p>There is a setting in menu of my camera wether to use or not to use electronic first curtain shutter. So far I know that using electronic first curtain reduces shutter lag and the noise my camera makes when shooting photos. And electronic first curtain shutter could also be useful to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/34850/vibration-control-for-sony-nex-3-exposures"">reduce camera vibration when shooting distant subjects</a>, like in moon photography.</p>

<p>So, three good reasons to use it. Should I use it? Is there any disadvantages when using electronic first curtain shutter? There must be, or why else would they even give me a setting in camera menu to choose whether to use it or not.</p>

<li><p>Usually useful. Noise reduction is significant.<br>
A single muted unsharp mechanical noise may be overlooked in many situations. But the ""double tap"" of two mechanical curtains is fairly distinctive. </p></li>
<li><p>May cause problems with </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> See ""Yes!!!"" at end.<br>
EFCS may cause large under-exposure at very high shutter speeds.<br>
Sample of 1 so far. Mine !!!<br>
Makes sense (see end) but exact basis as yet TBD. </p>

<hr>

<p>Sony SLT &amp; mirrorless cameras and many Canon EOS DSLrs offer EFCS.</p>

<p>I have a Sony A77 SLT - I use it in EFCS mode and have only used mechanical FCS to compare the modes. For me the main advantage is reduced noise. The SLT fixed mirror and single shutter operation vastly reduce noise compared to a mirror plus 2 shutter actions SLR. </p>

<p>It is implied by Sony that the EFCS may cause image blurring with moving objectcsat large apertures at larger focal lengths. The rationale for this is given below - basically the EFCS has a finite dot writing speed which causes it to be unable to provide a high enough ""enable"" signal to start sensor light-writing. </p>

<hr>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.mhohner.de/newsitem2/efcs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this web discussion</a>. </p>

<p>The Sony NEX5n manual says (lost in translation):</p>

<p>They note that Sony suggests EFCS not be used in some situations eg.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you shoot at high shutter speeds with a large diameter lens attached, the ghosting of a blurred area may occur, depending on the subject or shooting conditions. In such cases, set this item to [Off].</li>
</ul>

<p>And then provides this plausible discussion:</p>

<hr>

<p>The first electronic curtain is likely rate limited by the clock it shared with readout. So it can't clear rows faster than it could read them. The second curtain isn't limited by this clock. A mechanical shutter with a sync speed of 1/250 exposing at 1/8000 will move a slit 250:8000 of the height of the frame across it. If the height has 4000 rows, then the size of this slit is 4000*250/8000 = 125 rows. For an electronic shutter, which has a sync speed of say 1/12 (at still resolution; the A77 shoots at up to 12fps, right?) this becomes 4000*12/8000 = 6 rows. At 1/24 it would be 12 rows. So if you're panning with a fast lens wide open, tracking a subject, it's not hard to see how the background could smear.</p>

<p>What they're really saying is that at high shutter speeds and narrow depth of field, turn it off when shooting moving subjects. Sports, wildlife; that sort of thing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sony also say:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a Minolta/Konica Minolta lens is used, set this item to [Off]. If you set this item to [On], the correct exposure will not be set or the image brightness will be uneven.</li>
</ul>

<p>See Stan's comment in this. I'd have thought that the camera could easily add delay if required - say a default delay if the lens is not in the camera's ""library"". And a user adjustable delay could easily be added. </p>

<p><strong>And discussion says:</strong></p>

<p>Not sure what the difference in lenses is; maybe newer Minolta and all Sony branded lenses have better defined aperture timing, or can go from one aperture to another without passing through an implicit reset state (wide open). Or some other practical difference that matters here.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Yes!!!</h2>

<p>My A77 often exposes incorrectly at very high shutter speeds - ay high ISO and bright day when subject matter swings from shadow into bright sun.<br>
In aperture priority mode, as light increases shutter speed increases. As increaseing light moves shutter speed from 1/4000s to 1/6000s the image darkens appreciably and at 1/8000s the image is massively underexposed.</p>

<p>BUT I just tried this with mechanical front curtain shutter and the problem appears to vanish. This testing was done with CFL bulbs and a white ceiling as its 1am here but I'll be trying this in daylight asap. </p>

<p>In this case it may be that the very fine tolerances between electronic turn on and mechanical exposure removal are easily swamped by small error in mechanical timing.<br>
Even at a full curtain traverse time of say 1/250s, to get 1/8000s effective the shutter needs to be open 250/8000 = 1/32 ~+ 3% of the width of the sensor. If shutter edge is ""out"" by 1% in position the exposure may be reduced by 1/3. A 2% position error gives only 1/3 exposure and a ~= 3% position error gives ~= darkness. </p>

<p>This may well be a calibration adjustment. 
More anon when/if I find out.</p>

<p>Added 2:</p>

<p>I do not have time now to experiment further at present but:</p>

<p>Exposure with and without EFCS at 1/8000s was good with Sony 50mm, f/1.8 (DT 1.8/50 SAM) even when imaging a CFL light bulb and surroundings at f/2.4. </p>

"Is it possible to convert a film SLR to digital?","22062","","<p>This may well be a question to which the answer is ""can't be done,"" but I was wondering whether it was possible to convert a film SLR to a DSLR by putting a sensor in place of the film. I have a bunch of old bodies and lenses which I would love to be able to use, but I just don't want to mess around with film, so I was wondering whether it's possible to convert them to take digital images. </p>
","<p>This has certainly been done with medium format SLRs that have interchangeable backs (e.g., Leaf and Phase One backs).</p>

<p>For a 35mm camera, the situation isn't nearly so positive. There was once a company that claimed to be working on a digital sensor that would be shaped like a 35mm film cannister with the sensor sticking out roughly like the film tongue. I'm reasonably certain they never produced even a partially working prototype, and even more certain they never put a product onto the market. Personally, I rather doubt it could be done. </p>

<p>In any case, the market opportunity for such a product is mostly past -- the vast majority of people who want to shoot digital have given up on the idea and bought digital bodies. Most have upgraded at least once by now, so used digital bodies are fairly common and quite reasonably priced...</p>

"If I have an 85mm lens for portraits, is a 50mm useful as well?","22022","","<p>I recently got my Canon EF 85mm f1.8, after lot of thought over if I should buy <em>Canon EF 85mm f1.8</em> or <em>Canon EF 50mm f1.4</em>, I decided on 85mm so that I can shoot portraits of people even from a distance, though I might have difficulty in closeup shots where space might be less!</p>

</ol>
","<p>I have the 50mm 1.8 - it takes great pictures but it's not a pro lens - the auto focus is slow and have a tendency to hunt a bit, the manual focus ring is tiny and the build quality is ... well, don't expect much (but it is cheap and optically wonderful).</p>

<p>I've heard the 85mm 1.8 is a great lens and if I had it I would go for something around 30mm (Canon or 3rd party) for a second lens, not the 50mm.</p>

"What is the focal length on your typical cell phone camera?","21999","","<p>Now, let me clarify (or...divulge) a few things. 
I know cell phone cameras are generally wide angle, which makes sense because hey, people wanna go out to dinner, or a show, or at the park with their kids, and they wanna get the whole scene. And hey, even though digital zoom is horrible...if anyone needs to get closer, they zoom. </p>

<p>Now, I took a picture with my phone the other day, and I didnt realize it, but it had EXIF info! It said 5mm. Now I understand the sensor size on the cameras are MUCH smaller, so does ANYONE know what this equates to? </p>

<p>Point of all this?? I am not in a rush to get a wide angle lens for my DSLR just yet. I believe that I can get away with just using my phone for wide shots....for now. And yes, I know it's not necessarily the same. (although there could be an argument that there is no shallow depth of field in a wide angle lens or a cell phone, so....). </p>

<p>But anyway, thoughts everyone? Does anyone know what the focal lengths are on cell phones...generally? </p>
","<p>The actual focal length of the lens is usually measured along with the crop factor of the sensor. Cell phones, needless to say, have a huge crop factor. For example, the Samsung Galaxy SIII and iPhone 4 are a 7.6x crop. So, if you have a 5mm lens on one of those, you're looking at an equivalent full frame focal length of 38mm. That's wide, but not that wide... you could get far wider on any dSLR.</p>

<p>If you want to play with some comparisons, you can check out this cool <a href=""http://cameraimagesensor.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Camera Sensor Size</a> comparison site to match up your phone and dSLR. I would expect the phone lenses to usually fall somewhere around 30-50mm in effective field of view versus a full frame dSLR.</p>

"How many pixels in a megapixel?","21955","","<p>I am trying to find out the definition of a megapixel? Some references on the web place it at 1 million pixels, and other places say it is equal to 2^20 = 1,048,576 pixels.</p>
","<p><strong>About a million.</strong></p>

<p>I think that in general due to rounding — and more importantly, other real world factors which mean that megapixels only relate loosely to actual resolving power — it doesn't really matter if ""megapixels"" is binary or decimal. It is a useful term because it happens to be in the range where we get human-useful small numbers with the digital cameras (so far). It's rarely used to mean a precise value — one 16-megapixel camera will likely generate photos with a slightly different size than one from another brand.</p>

<p>For the same basic reason, ""kilopixel"" isn't a real word, because there's no particular case where it would be useful.</p>

<p>Overall, a lot of us coming to photography from a tech background, be it programmer, engineer, or otherwise, have a tendency to look for precision. When it comes to exposure, anything under a third of a stop is unlikely to be a big deal, and when it comes to pixels, a similar basic rule makes sense: until we're talking about doubling or halving the number, don't sweat it.</p>

","<p>Having many autofocus points opens up the camera's capabilities because it can function in different ways depending upon settings and camera features:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can select a single AF point (get precise with exactly which point you want to use, without recomposing at all).</li>
<li>You can select a group of AF points (a group of AF points means you don't need to be as precise in your selection/aim, and that if the subject moves within the group it'll still maintain focus).</li>
<li>You can select the best AF point for the job (not all AF points are equal; some are more/less sensitive, and some are horizontal sensitive while others are vertical).</li>
<li>You can let the camera choose which AF points to use (it'll try to get the most area in-focus at once).</li>
<li>You can track subjects as they move across the frame (as the subject exits one AF point or group of AF points and enters another, each point will keep the subject in focus).</li>

"Should I buy a camera with kit lens, or body plus lens separately?","21878","","<p>I am planning to buy a DSLR soon.</p>

<p>Before I zero in on the model, I want to know whether it is advisable to buy a kit (body + 18-55 lens) or not? OR should I go for the camera-body and the lens separately?</p>
","<p>The answer is, unfortunately, depends.</p>

<p>First, what kit are we talking about? The 5D Mark II kit comes with the 24-105mm f4 IS L lens. The lens is roughly $1000 new, so selling it immediately, gives you discount on the body itself, so it absolutely makes sense to get the kit (unless you don't want to hassle with selling the lens). I bought the 5d2 kit, even though I already had a great copy of the 24-105 (I kept my original and sold the new one) However the 24-105 f4 IS L lens is a great general purpose zoom, so I would think twice before selling it. In kit your looking at, the 18-55mm Zoom lens isn't that all great of a lens. It works, but there are a number of drawbacks. The lens costs $170 new, but you will have a harder time selling that lens for that price.</p>

<p>Next, what is your budget? If you can afford a better lens, then you should buy a better lens. Lens are far more important than camera bodies. However, having no lens is way way way worse than having a ""bad"" lens. So if you need the 18-55mm range, and can't afford the step-up alternatives (or even the 3rd party alternatives), then get the kit lens. </p>

<p>Finally, what other goodies are you getting with the kit? If you search, you can find kits that also come with bags, memory cards, a filter, 2nd batteries, cleaners, etc. If you don't have these items already, they will add up quickly. Having them thrown into the kit will generally reduce your total cost.</p>

<li>Often, less control of settings like shutter speed, ISO, and aperture. Video also can generally deal with a bit more motion blur than still photos, and the camera may allow the shutter speed to drag longer than you might want.</li>
<li>Video compression artifacts. Aside from key frames, most frames in a compressed video are rendered by modifying a prior frame. This results in artifacts that may not be noticeable in a video, but will degrade the quality of your photo. This depends a lot on the codec and the bitrate of the video.</li>

<p>Are there some particular ""colours"" of lights that one should prefer?
Is it advisable to purchase a white umbrella too? How and when is that used for table lamps?</p>
","<p>Regarding what type of bulb - getting a good lighting effect is seldom a function of the bulb (leave color aside). In any reasonable working distance, all bulbs become a <em>point source</em> equivalent (*). When doing portraits, it is usually desirable to create a <em>large</em> light source, thus having ""soft"" light (note - <em>soft</em>, not <em>flat</em>). The way to achieve this is by using some kind of diffuser or soft box. An easy setup can be a shoot-through umbrella.</p>

<p>(*) an exception is a long fluorescent bulb, but still it is a 1 dimensional light which may create harder shadows in the perpendicular direction.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Summary of the discussion in the comments, to OP's request:</strong></p>

<p><em>What umbrella can I use?</em></p>

<p>A ""shoot through"" umbrella is the semitransparent white one. A reflector umbrella can be used as well. The idea is to enlarge the effective light source. The advantage of shoot-through is that the ""source"" can be located much closer to the subject (technically, to 0 distance) than the reflector (where you are limited by the shaft length). This means that compared to the subject, the relative source is bigger. The disadvantage is that being semitransparent, you reduce the power of the light source.</p>

<p><em>Can I use the lamp's ""shade"" instead?</em></p>

<p>I'd say that a ""shade"" is similar in effect (just smaller). You do want a white one, though.</p>

<p><em>Where can I find such an umbrella?</em></p>

<p>Here's one: <a href=""http://www.dealextreme.com/p/flash-reflector-umbrella-large-5123"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dealextreme.com</a>. You can easily find more on eBay or Amazon.</p>

<p><em>What should be the power of the bulb?</em></p>

<p>Generally, power is ""the more the better"", but be careful of overheating. A dimmer controlled light will be best to get the desired effect. Weaker light can be compensated by longer exposures. You want stronger light mainly because you want shorter exposures to minimize motion blur. Also, the stronger your source, the more dominant it is and allows you better control of you lighting setup. A dimmer, however, will let you decrease the power according to the actual need, and basically will allow you to get closer to the subject.</p>

<p>That said, a cheap off camera flash with manual mode is far more flexible than a fixed light fixture. You can find some at the same websites I pointed to above, together with an optional optical slaves (to be triggered by your on camera flash). Some have an integrated slave. For others, use a standalone slave.</p>

","<p>What you have there is the thumbnail stored <em>inside</em> a normal EXIF JPEG file. </p>

<p>The size 160×120 is a significant clue that this is where these thumbnails come in, because although I don't think the standard mandates a particular size, 160×120 is <a href=""http://www.exif.org/samples.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">incredibly common</a>. (My DSLR saves thumbnails that size, and in fact ""letterboxes"" the 3:2 images with black bars to fit the aspect ratio.) It must have seemed like a good idea at the time the EXIF standard was written, but these tiny thumbnails are so low quality and so small that they are rarely actually used for anything — yet most JPEG files still contain them.</p>

<p>Recovery software works by scanning your data disk block by disk block (or even byte by byte) regardless of any filesystem structure, looking for blocks of data which appear JPEG-like. The thumbnails are perfectly normal JPEG files themselves, so recovery software will pick them up.</p>

<p>If that's <em>all</em> you're getting, it's likely that the filesystem you're trying to recover from is so messed up that the big files can't be reconstructed, but the tiny internal thumbnails will sometimes fit in a single disk block (or maybe two together), so they're more likely to be intact.

","<p>Digital camera sensor format-size names have their roots in television camera tubes. These were measured in inches diagonal, but for various practical reasons, the entire circle isn't used. So, from way back then, there's a concept called ""the rule of 16"", which says that the <em>usable</em>, actual sensor diagonal for a 1"" tube is 16mm. (Yes, it mixes imperial and metric measurements.) So, for each ""inch"" in a sensor format designation, translate that to approximately 16mm of sensor diagonal. Or, for formats smaller than an inch — very typical, e.g. <code>1/2.5""</code> — use the corresponding fraction of 16mm.</p>

<p>This rule matches the 1""-format designation for this sensor: 13.2mm × 8.8mm has a diagonal of 15.9mm, and you can see how it roughly applies to the other typical compact digicam formats as well. Usually, there's a little variation and sensor-makers round to the nearest somewhat-standard fraction, but occasionally, <a href=""http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1000&amp;message=35180204"" rel=""noreferrer"">as with the 1/1.83"" Nokia N8</a>, a very-specific number is given, in which case it's almost certain that they're following the 1"" = 16mm rule literally.</p>

"What is the Base ISO of a Canon 5D MK III?","21513","","<p>Can anyone tell me what the base ISO is of a Canon 5D MK III?</p>

<p>I was reading this great piece on ETTR (<a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/articles/6641165460/ettr-exposed/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>) and (<a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/articles/6641165460/ettr-exposed/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a>) and it repeatedly mentions how important shooting at Base ISO is when using ETTR. I understand his reasoning, but I can't seem to find a dependable resource that tells me what my camera's native ISO is.</p>

<p>There is a lot of conjecture and answers ranging from 100 - 640.</p>
","<p>The base ISO of all Canon cameras is ISO 100. This is the ISO with the lowest gain, without any in-camera magickry to achieve the setting (like ISO 50, which mucks with the actual exposure settings behind the scenes). </p>

<p>There is a lot of conjecture and misunderstanding about Canon's ISO settings because they use a ""real/push/pull"" model for ISO settings, rather than using native analog gain for all ISO settings. Canon only uses a standard analog gain (per-pixel amplification) for full stop ISO settings up to a certain high ISO level. So, ISO 100, 200, 400, ..., 3200 are usually achieved by using standard analog signal amplification. After a certain point, really high ISO settings in Canon cameras are achieved via a base analog amp., plus a secondary downstream (post-read/pre-ADC) amp, and possibly a digital boost. </p>

<p>For Canon cameras pre-5D III generation (i.e. 5D II, 7D, 50D, 550D, etc.) the highest directly amplified ISO settting is usually 1600, after which a combination of downstream amplification, push/pull, and possibly digital boost is used. For post-5D III generation (i.e. 5D III, 1D X, 6D, 70D, etc.) cameras, the highest directly amplified ISO setting is either 3200 or 6400, with the possibility that rebels still top out at ISO 1600.</p>

<p>Finally, third-stop ISO settings are achieved by using a 1/3rd stop ""push"" or ""pull"" using a downstream amplifier after read. ISO 125 is a third-stop ""push"" of ISO 100, where as ISO 160 is a third-stop ""pull"" of ISO 200. ISO 250 is a third-stop ""push"" of ISO 200, where as ISO 320 is a third-stop ""pull"" of ISO 400. This is why the 2/3rds stop ISO settings in Canon cameras are a little cleaner...the ""pull"" shoves the noise floor down a little bit. </p>

<p>The use of push/pull does not make ISO 160, 320, or 640 the ""base"" ISO...that is an internet myth, breed by conjecture, misunderstanding, and a simple lack of real knowledge of how Canon achieves the necessary signal boost for each ISO setting. All Canon cameras (with the exception of some of the earliest models) use ISO 100 as base ISO.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Base ISO is different than Unity ISO. Unity ISO is the ISO setting where gain is one, or in other words for every electron of charge, the ADC converts one DU (digital unit). It is pretty rare that Unity ISO is actually selectable, however there is usually a close third-stop setting to unity. What Unity ISO is depends on the camera, the sensor, the full-well capacity, and other factors (Roger Clark has lots of information on his site for popular Canon camera models, and within them he usually derives unity gain, if knowing it is important (some applications may benefit from unity gain).) </p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding ETTR, and the use of Base ISO. That is a simple fallacy, really. ETTR simply means Expose to the Right. That's it. There <strong>should not</strong> be any additional caveats to that. ETTR is a very simple, strait forward rule, and it does not require that one always shoot at ISO 100 or base ISO. I am a Canon user, and rarely shoot at ISO 100 for most of my photography, which is birds and wildlife. Most of my photography is at least ISO 400, more often between 800 and 1600. I generally follow ETTR, regardless of the ISO setting. </p>

<p>ETTR offers a simple benefit: It puts more of the signal above the noise floor, which improves your editing latitude. ISO 100 is not, and should not be, a requirement for ETTR. Using ISO 100, assuming you have enough light, simply maximizes your dynamic range, within which ETTR is still shifting more of the signal above the noise floor. In Canon cameras, ISO 100, 200, and to some degree 400 have more read noise than all higher ISO settings. The higher read noise floor means you technically get more benefit from ETTR. If you are a landscape photographer, then ISO 100 is probably a given, but it is still not a <strong>requirement</strong> for ETTR.</p>

"Adjust exposure compensation in manual mode?","21501","","<p>The only way to manually adjust exposure compensation is to use either P,A,S or modes, however then of course something else is automated. In full manual mode you can not change exposure compensation ?</p>

<p>Am I mistaken, why is this ? Are other advanced cameras like this ?</p>
","<p>This question tells me you should start by understanding exposure first. Start with reading about the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6598/what-is-the-exposure-triangle"">Exposure-Triangle</a>. If you understand that, you would not be asking this :)</p>

<p>Briefly, exposure is determined by 3 parameters: ISO, Shutter-Speed and Aperture. When you are in manual mode and set all these, that is it. No further adjust is possible or needed.</p>

<p>When you are in an automatic mode, you adjust 0, 1 or 2 of these three and the camera determines the rest. The point is that there is at <em>least</em> one left. Exposure-Compensation shifts how the camera sets the parameters it controls. If it cannot control anything as in manual mode, there is nothing to shift.</p>

<p>Most mid-range cameras with manual-controls and a single control-dial use this to their advantage where the EC button switches between controlling aperture and shutter-speed in Manual mode. If your camera has dual control-dials, EC either does nothing or shifts the Exposure-Meter which can be used as a <em>guide</em> to set Manual exposure. It does not affect exposure in this case either.</p>

"Why doesn't my camera have lens corrections for my new lens?","21488","","<p>I've been using a brand new Canon 5D Mark III (with the latest firmware v1.2.3) with some recent lenses (all older than the camera itself though), but most of them don't have any lens correction information available when I check in the camera's ""Lens Aberration Correction"" menu option.</p>

<p>The lenses are:</p>

<ul>
<li>35mm f/2 IS (2012) = no</li>
<li>50mm f/1.8 II (1990) = no</li>
<li>85mm f/1.2L II (2006) = yes</li>
</ul>

<p>At first I thought maybe the 35mm was too new, though after checking the dates I would expect firmware to have been updated by now (~1-2 years after release).</p>

<p>I'm sure I've seen other cameras (e.g. a 7D) show Peripheral Illumination correction for these, so why doesn't the 5D Mark III have at least Peripheral Illumination corrections (even if not Chromatic Aberration)?</p>
","<p>The lens corrections aren't part of the firmware itself (i.e. a particular firmware doesn't mean you have a particular lens correction). They are profiles that can be stored in the camera, and you need to register them with the camera if they aren't in the default set.</p>

<p>Canon DSLRs that support lens corrections (<a href=""http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/standard_display/EOS_Advantage_IQ#f"" rel=""noreferrer"">Peripheral Illumination</a> and/or <a href=""http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/standard_display/EOS_Advantage_IQ#e"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chromatic Aberration</a>) only have space for a certain number of correction profiles. As far as I'm aware all Canon DSLRs that support lens corrections have space for up to 40 lens profiles, but ship with a <strong>default selection of about 25 lens profiles</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note that most Canon DSLR models since about 2008 support in-camera Peripheral Illumination correction (DiG!C 4 or later), while in-camera Chromatic Aberration correction was introduced in models starting around 2012 (DiG!C 5 and up).</em></p>

<p>I guess these are the profiles Canon deem to be the most likely to be used. The 5D Mark III's default set are most (if not all) of their current L-series lenses (without extenders). This is why the 85mm f/1.2L II is included, but not the 35mm f/2 IS (non-L), and even the older 85mm f/1.2 (version I, no longer available) is not included by default.</p>

<p><strong>In order to add/remove lens profiles, you need to</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>connect the camera to your computer via USB</li>
<li>install &amp; run the <strong>Canon EOS Utility</strong>,</li>
<li>select '<strong>Camera Settings/Remote Shooting</strong>' mode</li>
<li>choose '<strong>Lens Aberration Correction</strong>' from the lens <strong>shooting menu</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a <a href=""http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/8200845600.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">more detailed set of instructions</a> from Canon's Support website.</p>

<p>From there you will get an interface to check or uncheck lenses for the camera to remember. Any valid combinations with the 1.4x and 2x extenders are also shown (as separate profiles to the base lens).</p>

<p>It's a relatively simple adjustment, but requires the Canon software and some foresight if you're going to borrow or test out a lens/body/extender.</p>

<p>If you forget to do this in advance, then hopefully you shot RAW photos. You can then use Canon's <em>Lens Aberration correction</em> to apply correction for peripheral illumination, chromatic aberration, color blur, and distortion from within their <em>Digital Photo Professional</em> software after the fact (to RAW files only). For RAW files made using one of 39 lenses with currently available DLO profiles you can use the more comprehensive <em>Digital Lens Optimizer</em>.</p>

"How to take great night shots with a subject in the foreground and a cityscape behind?","21458","","<p>I have Canon Rebel XS (EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Autofocus Lens). I have been trying to take decent night photographs for a while. But it seems to take a lot of effort. Can we take good night shots without a tripod?

","<p>I too am keen to see some more answers to this, in the mean-time here is my contribution:</p>

<p>A tripod (or at least some sort of support) has got to be a ""must have"" for this sort of night photography:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduced camera shake means sharper images</li>
<li>Lower ISO settings mean less grainy images</li>
<li>Longer exposure times can also give interesting effects (for example with car lights)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have any fast lenses so I can't say how much of a difference a fast lens will make, however I <em>know</em> that proper support makes a <strong>big</strong> difference! :-)</p>

<p>I've seen bean bags suggested as a suitable tripod alternative for when travelling, also depending on where you are you might also get away with resting your camera on walls or benches (however you will find that your photo opportunities are far more limited)</p>

"Why did Canon come up with APS-H and why did the top-of-the-line 1D's *still* use it and 1.3x crop, when FF existed for four years (the 5D)?","21427","","<p>With the 1.5/1.6X (APS-C/DX) crop factors and full frame just about ubiquitous these days in the digital world -- why hadn't Canon's top-of-the-line 1D's moved to FF sooner?  It took four years!</p>

<p>Is there anything special about the 1.3x crop factor?  Or is Canon afraid of causing old 1D users who are upgrading to the latest Mark XX to have to re-adapt?</p>

<p>Or is there really an advantage?</p>

<p>You take a look at the Reuters photoblogs, they seem to use 1D's a lot.  </p>

<p>Is it an accident of history, or is there a practical reason here?  I would be an interested to see an answer from a late-model 1D-user!</p>
","<p>When Canon released the first 1D, APS-H was simply the largest sensor they could get away with, economically. They followed it up with the 1Ds which was full frame. However the 1Ds was slower than the 1D, and offered less reach with telephoto lenses, so was less popular with sports and wildlife photographers. For this reason Canon chose to continue offering a faster, lower resolution 1.3&times; crop body in the 1D line.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, Canon decided to end the 1D line with the introduction of the 1DX. They were able to exceed the speed of the last 1D whilst improving resolution (slightly) and offering a full frame sensor. Even so the decision wasn't universally popular, especially with photographers that appreciated the extra reach from the 1D crop factor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would be an interested to see an answer from a late-model 1D-user!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a 1DmkIV for 2 years. I was a 5D user but was never fully satisfied with either the speed or more importantly the autofocus with the outer points. I waited for the 5DmkII to come out and when it did I was very disappointed that they addressed neither the speed or the AF performance.</p>

<p>The 1DmkIII was a 2MP upgrade from its 8MP predecessor, whereas the 1DIV jumped to 16MP. This prompted me to switch from full frame to APS-H, as I could still get large prints if I needed to. I found no fault with the camera in terms of its AF, speed, or features, but I had to convince myself I could live with the crop factor. </p>

<p>However over time I began to find the crop factor annoying. Ultra wide angle lens options were very limited, I ended up using the EF-S 10-22 which I modified to fit the EF mount and was usable without vignetting from 13-22mm. The only problem with this was that the mirror would hit the back of the lens if I accidentally zoomed right out. I also missed the 85mm FOV, my 85mm was a bit too long and my 50mm was a bit too wide.</p>

<p>In summary I don't think there's anything magic about the 1.3&times; crop, unless you need  the reach I think it can be quite annoying.</p>

<p>When the 5DmkIII came out with top-of-the-line AF and 6.5 fps, the decision became clear and I sold the 1DmkIV. Fortunately they had become sought after since their discontinuation so I sold it for a fraction less that I had paid for it!</p>

","<p>The safest position for your SLR is in your bank's safety deposit box.</p>

- If bag hits ground, you must ship the body off to repair the screen</p>

- Big handle to grab camera with... faster to shooting position<br>

  optics and perfect focus, the moiré is

</blockquote>

<h2>Compared to focus charts</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Much more precise.</li>
<li>Unaffected by tungsten / incandescent lighting, which causes front focus. (I'm not positive if extreme monitor color temperatures affect it.)</li>
<li>Easier to line up 100% perpendicular, yet less affected by it.</li>
<li>Doesn't require taking a picture: liveview is sufficient with magnification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Without liveview, I'd imagine it'd be tedious.</li>
<li>Can't calibrate for tungsten lighting. (Though you can use a focus chart to supplement, and estimate the offset you'd need to give it for tungsten)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Target Pattern</h2>

It's a black-and-white image of concentric rings which get increasingly small and close as the they get further from the center circle.</p>

<p>There's nothing particularly magic about this image: anything which produces a moire pattern on an LCD screen should work, but this one is designed to give good results in many situations. Bart van der Wolf also produced an <a href=""http://www.xs4all.nl/~bvdwolf/temp/OPF/MicroFocusAdjust1.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">earlier moire target design</a> which some people apparently find works better.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<h3>Setup and familiarization:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Load the target pattern at 1:1 / 100% view in any image viewer — your web browser will do, but make sure it's showing the image unscaled.</li>
<li>Set up your camera on a tripod perpendicular and at the appropriate distance away from the screen

<ul>
<li>Camera-to-subject distance should ideally be no less than 50 times the focal length of the lens. For a 50mm lens, that would be at least 2.5 meters (25m for a 500mm).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Turn on liveview and magnify until the image is close to filling the screen.</li>
<li>In manual focus mode, adjust the focus distance and become familiar with the maximum interference pattern</li>
</ol>

<h3>Method 1:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Go to the point of maximum interference.  You do this by focusing manually (contrast detect may not be as precise, but you can try).</li>
<li>Switch to phase detect and push the AF button.</li>
<li>If the focus changes, dial in microadjustment in the correct direction and repeat.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Method 2 (more accurate, in my opinion):</h3>

<ol>
<li>Set focus to infinity or closest focus.</li>
<li>Autofocus using phase detection.  Some cameras let you do this while in liveview.</li>
<li>In liveview, manually adjust focus to see if it was front or back focused.  </li>
<li>If so, adjust and repeat.</li>

Think of it a bit like reading glasses - it allows for minor vision correction.  The idea is that folks who have decent vision but might need minor correction can make an adjustment on the diopter so that as they look through the viewfinder, objects are clear.</p>

<p>As you note, for someone with perfect vision, throwing and adjustment in there can actually make things look worse and cause problems with manual focus.</p>

<p>As it is a manual/mechanical adjustment, I'm not aware of a way to disable the ability to adjust the diopter, although a bit of gaffer's tape over the dial might help avoid inadvertent adjustments.</p>

"What is the Chief Ray Angle (CRA)?","21192","","<p>I want to select image sensors for a particular application.<br>
One term that I have come across regularly in their datasheets is the CRA. I was comparing 2 image sensors and although they were of similar resolution(in terms of MegaPixel) they differed in CRA.  </p>

<p>What I would like to know is:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any definitive literature that could explain to me what is the CRA?</li>
<li>What are the implications of the CRA and what would it effect? </li>
</ol>
","<p>I'm not an optics expert, but it's do with the angle of incident rays which travel through the very centre of the aperture. In a pin-hole camera, which has a very small aperture the only rays which reach the image plane would be chief or principal rays.</p>

<p>A couple of definitions of CRA:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_%28optics%29#Optical_systems"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_%28optics%29#Optical_systems</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The Chief Ray Angle is a property of the lens, not the sensor, however what I think the data sheets are referring to is the maximum CRA at which a good reading can be taken. If light rays strike a digital sensor too obliquely, there are issues with intensity and colour shifts. This tends to happen when the rear of the lens sits very close to the sensor such as in rangefinder or mirrorless large sensor digital cameras. See:</p>

"What lenses would best comprise a travel photography kit?","21051","","<p>On a crop sensor camera, e.g. Canon EOS 7D, what would be the best kit to travel with around Europe for a few weeks?

<li>I will not have a tripod.</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand some may consider this subjective, but I do believe that for a crop sensor body, with weight as a consideration, and a limit to the amount of lenses, a true <strong>best kit</strong> can be determined.</p>
","<p>I literally just got back (a few days ago) from spending a few weeks in Europe with my 7D, <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-10-22mm-f-3.5-4.5-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10-22mm</a>, <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-17-55mm-f-2.8-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">17-55mm</a>, <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-50mm-f-1.8-II-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">50mm</a> and <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-55-250mm-f-4-5.6-IS-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">55-250mm</a>. I too have little interest in portraits, and took a lot of landscapes, architecture and ""detail"" shots on my trip. And I left my tripod at home... so perhaps some of my experiences/thoughts will be useful...</p>

<p>I carried the 3 zooms around with me <em>most</em> of the time, occasionally taking the 50mm out, and if I wasn't really feeling up to carrying it all, I'd just take the 17-55. I remember at the time thinking the 10-22 and 55-250 were by far the most useful lenses, though oddly the proportion of all photos from each lens was:</p>

<ul>
<li>EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM — <strong>44%</strong></li>
<li>EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 — <strong>28%</strong></li>
<li>EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM — <strong>24%</strong></li>
<li>EF 50mm f/1.8 II — <strong>4%</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I've yet to sort through my photos, so if I remember I'll come back and update the percentages based on the photos I actually liked (; I'm quite sure the best will be from the wide and telephoto.</p>

<p>I remember thinking often that I'd have probably been happier with the 10-22mm and a better telephoto (<a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-70-200mm-f-4.0-L-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">70-200 f/4L</a> or <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-70-300mm-f-4-5.6-IS-L-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">70-300L</a>), and just a 30mm in the middle (for weight reasons). The other thing I wanted was a second body... As much as I like my 17-55 (especially if it's the only lens I'm carrying), I have a feeling that two bodies, one with a good wide angle, the other a good telephoto, and a 'normal' (30mm for crop) prime in the bag, just in case, is all one really needs... but it's hard to justify a second body just to be switching lenses less frequently! But for travel or events, when lots of things are new and unexpected, it seems to make sense.</p>

<p>I found the 10-22mm great for the big old churches, even though the 17-55 has a wider aperture, 17mm just didn't cut it in some of them. I think a similar lens that goes as wide as 11 or 12mm would also be fine (e.g. Sigma/Tamron/Tokina offerings), but the 17 or 18mm wide end of 'normal zooms' wouldn't cut it.</p>

<p>The tele was great for odd details, especially interesting people (I'm not one to approach people to take a photo), a bit of wildlife and the like. Mine's the kit one I got with my 450D a few years back which I'm saving up to replace with something with a wider aperture, but even so it was very useful and sufficient quality at f/8 to f/16.</p>

<p>The 17-55 was most useful when I didn't want to carry a lot, since its kind of wide and kind of long, so I'd probably still take it again, (even if I had a 30mm prime), unless I was expecting to have all my gear with me at all times, and wouldn't be comfortable leaving it behind somewhere on shorter day trips.</p>

<p>So if you want to stick to 3 lenses, I'd suggest an ultra-wide like the <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-10-22mm-f-3.5-4.5-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon 10-22mm</a>, a good tele zoom like the <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-70-200mm-f-4.0-L-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">70-200 f/4L IS USM</a> (or <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-70-300mm-f-4-5.6-IS-L-USM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">70-300</a> if you like wildlife which I usually find I'm wanting more than 250 for) and a 30mm prime like the <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Sigma-30mm-f-1.4-EX-DC-HSM-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sigma 30mm f/1.4 HSM</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: In hindsight, with a bigger gap than I had between the wide and zoom (i.e. 22 to 70mm instead of just 22 to 55mm, you may be wanting more than just a 30mm or 35mm prime in the middle there... especially if you don't already have a 30mm and use it regularly enough to be comfortable with it!)</p>

"What is the largest possible print size with 35mm film?","20950","","<p>What is the largest possible size I can enlarge to with 35mm film?</p>
","<p>There's an interesting and thorough paper explaining film resolution, granularity and print grain: <a href=""http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/emg/library/pdf/vitale/2007-04-vitale-filmgrain_resolution.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/emg/library/pdf/vitale/2007-04-vitale-filmgrain_resolution.pdf</a></p>

<p>There is no clear answer to your question as it depends on multiple factors, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Film's ability to record fine detail or resolution, which in turn consists of:

<ul>
<li>resolving power (function of particle density in the emulsion)</li>
<li>granularity (function of particle clumping in the emulsion)</li>
<li>sharpness (perceived edge distinction)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The resolution depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>camera quality (lens mount and film plane alignment, etc)</li>
<li>lens quality (resolution and amount of aberrations)</li>
<li>film type (different films of same speed have different resolution)</li>
<li>film speed (granularity increases with speed)</li>
<li>exposure (overexposure leads to more granularity)</li>
<li>film processing (handling, developer, conditions, etc)</li>
<li>film age and archival conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>One can say that this is all unimportant, unless I suddenly want to make prints from, say, ORWO film shot by my grandfather in the seventies with Smena.</p>

<p>Also different methods of judging resolution lead to different results, magnification under loupe or microscope is different from enlargements which in turn is different from scanning and printing.</p>

<p>Finally, the viewing distance plays very important role in how big you can print. Kodak has published print grain indexes for their <a href=""http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/e190/e190.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Portra line (page 7)</a>. It says that the grain of 35mm Portra 160 film is visible already in 4x6'' (10x15cm) prints, but without visual comparison or experience this does not mean a lot.</p>

<p>So the suggestion would be - test yourself, whatever numbers you get from here might not fulfill your expectations in the final print.</p>

"Why do my sRGB exports from Lightroom look different from RAW files shown in the program even though my monitor can only show sRGB?","20895","","<p>I have read tons of docs about color management over the Web, but there is something I can't understand.</p>

<p>I have a screen that can only render the RGB color space.  </p>

<p>It is very well calibrated using a LaCie Blue Eye Pro.</p>

<p>I use Lightroom to see an image, shot as RAW with a Canon camera, in ""Adobe RGB"" color space (even if that does not mean anything in this case).</p>

<p>When I open the image into Lighroom, and export it as JPG in the RGB color space, the image seen into Lightroom is not rendered the same as the one exported.</p>

<p>The thing that I don't understand is that, whatever the color space my original image can be, whatever the screen is calibrated or not, whatever software I use to see the image, if my screen cannot render more than the RGB color space, I guess that the image displayed into Lightroom and the one exported in the RGB color space should be rendered the same way on the screen.</p>

<p>What's wrong ?</p>
","<p>Color management is an annoyance that I've recently been learning about; it is not completely accurate to say that just because your monitor can only display sRGB that it's meaningless for your photos to be edited in the AdobeRGB or ProPhotoRGB space.  What is actually happening is that Lightroom is translating colors from ProPhotoRGB into the sRGB space that your monitor can display.  It does a bunch of fancy math (I think maybe some matrix algebra?  I'm not positive, though, maybe somebody can correct me) to perform this translation -- thus, what you see in Lightroom is not your image as it appears in ProPhotoRGB <i>or</i> in sRGB, you are seeing an <i>interpretation</i> of ProPhotoRGB space in sRGB that tries to be as faithful as possible to what the image would look like on a device capable of displaying ProPhotoRGB.</p>

<p>When you export your photos from LR, you have the option of choosing what color space you want to use for the exported photo (you can choose sRGB, AdobeRGB, and ProPhotoRGB, among others).  When LR does this, it first converts the photo into the chosen color space, and embeds information into the JPEG file describing the color space (these things are called ICC profiles).  Now, when you open the JPEG in some other program, if that program is able to understand the embedded color space information, it can perform the same math that LR does to convert the file into your monitor's color space, and it should appear the same (or at least similar to) LR.  If the program you open it in can interpret this embedded color space information, we say that it's a <i>color-managed</i> application.</p>

<p>The problem is that a lot of applications are not color-managed.  Windows Photo Viewer may or may not be (I've read competing statements, but in any case it doesn't seem to work as well as LR); Firefox only supports old versions of ICC profiles, Safari and IE are, and Chrome is not.  So if you open up your image in one of those applications that doesn't support color profiles, or doesn't support them well, your image is going to look bad because the proper color translation isn't being performed.</p>

<p>There's a really nice three-part series on color management <a href=""http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-management1.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  You can also check out whether the device you're displaying supports the appropriate ICC color profiles using <a href=""http://www.color.org/version4html.xalter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this test image</a>.  One other really neat feature of Photoshop CS5 (and maybe other editors too, I don't know) is that it will actually show you what parts of your image won't translate color spaces well; if you press Ctrl+Shift+Y, or go to View->Gamut Warning, it will highlight in grey the colors of the open image that don't exist in the target color space.  I've found this to be somewhat useful.</p>

<p>How fast does the shutter need to be to capture action in motion with perfect crisp clarity?</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that most flashes have a limit on their sync speed, which means that the use of flash will limit your fastest shutter time available.</p>

"What is dynamic range and how is it important in photography?","20791","","<p>Wikipedia says that the dynamic range is the ""ratio between the largest and smallest possible values of a changeable quantity"". Ok, I get that. I suppose that's why HDR photos have a ""high dynamic range"" with respect to light.</p>

<p>But what else is there to it? What's the dynamic range of a camera? Just tell me everything that's important about it :-).</p>
","<p>Okay this may be very out of scale, but it's my best guess as a simple demonstration of light intensities. Also, the capabilities of the sensors might be less or more. But you'll get the idea.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6tccU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The reason why dynamic range is so important is because it defines precisely how much of a scene can actually be represented within the bounds of the image's ""black"" and ""white"". The image above represents a very rough scale of how bright typical items in a scene are, whilst the 'brackets' on the right give a rough indication of how much of those intensities can be seen in detail at a given exposure. The shorter the exposure the higher your bracket goes (small exposure for bright clouds), the longer the exposure the lower it goes (longer for shadowed/night scenes).</p>

<p>Of course in real life there really isn't a black and white. Black would be the complete absence of light and white would an infinitely large amount of white light in all frequencies. But when it comes to photographing and vision, you're not working with such a high dynamic range.</p>

<p>The difference? If you expose a point and shoot to have the same white clipping point within the scene's light intensity, the point where black occurs may be brighter than the blacks in a digital SLR's image. This is because the much larger sensor is able to capture a greater variation in intensity of light. It's white point is brighter and it's black point is darker than the point and shoot. It sounds as if you understand this part.</p>

<p>Why is it important? What happens when you wish to see both the bright clouds in a scene but also the dark shadow areas inside the house through the back door? In most cases either the clouds will turn out bright white and you won't be able to see any detail, or the inside of the house will simply be black (or very close). <em>For the camera</em> it falls out of the current range of intensities you're exposing for.</p>

<p>This is one of the shortcomings of photography in relation to the performance of the eye. The human eye is typically able to see a far greater range of intensities than a camera, typically around 18 to 20 stops of intensity variation. We can see in the house and the bright clouds but the camera can only expose for one or the other. Most DSLR sensors can capture around 10-13 stops of dynamic range.</p>

<p><strong>Furthermore</strong>, the format the image is captured in (for digital photography) can allow for a significant amount of the dynamic range to be retained when converting the image into a usable JPEG, as it is the most common ""final"" format a photo ends up in.</p>

<p>With a JPEG, the format that a point and shoot will typically generate <em>for</em> you, each component of red, green and blue can only store 8 bits of accuracy. Black is 0, white is 255. This means there are 256 ""steps"" between black and white. Conversely, with high accuracy raw capture, these are typically capturing 12 to 14 bits of information. For 12-bit raw, black is still 0, but white is 4,096. In 14-bit capture, the white point is 16,384. What this means is that the variations in intensity are captured orders of magnitude more <em>accurately</em>. There are now up to 16,384 ""steps"" between the image's black and white points.</p>

<p>Even though you typically end up exporting to this 8-bit JPEG format, this allows the photographer before hand to adjust exposure, fill light and recover blown highlights far more accurately than if it was attempted with the final JPEG image. Not only can this allow you to ""save"" photos from the bin, it can also vastly improve the result you get out of well captured photos. One technique exploiting this is <a href=""http://photofocus.com/2009/08/29/expose-to-the-right/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Expose to the Right</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Furthermore #2</strong>: I think the biggest thing to note in relation to digital dynamic range is that for a given ISO setting, the SNR in a full frame sensor will be far greater than a point and shoot. At the same exposure, the ""big bucket"" photo sites in a full frame sensor allow more light to still fit into the range of the sensor. So +13 EV will still be registered whereas on a point and shoot it would simply be pure white, for example.</p>

<p>It's like having a 1L tin to capture water instead of a 500mL tin in a point and shoot.</p>

<p><strong>Furthermore #3 (with added photos)</strong>: Here is an example of just how limited some sensors can be.</p>

<p>This is what my iPhone produced. The first I exposed for the dark area down on the street. The second is exposed for the bright buildings and the third is a ""HDR"" image produced by the iPhone. With some tweaking the shadow area can be made to approximate the dynamic range of what I actually saw, though it's still limited.</p>

<p>Clearly the dynamic range is too limited in the iPhone to capture all information you need at once. At one end, the whites just completely blow out and at the other, the shadows are almost completely black.</p>

<p>I know it is a fat chance, but was hoping to find out if anyone has tried using the Maxxum lenses on the new Sony Alpha series?</p>
","<p>Yes and they should all work. All of mine certainly do.</p>

<p>The first thing Sony did when acquiring Konica-Minolta's camera division is release DSLRs with the same mount. These were named <em>Alpha</em> which is the same name Minolta used in Japan, they used the <em>Maxxum</em> name in North America and <em>Dynax</em> in Europe. In other words, Sony Alpha mount IS the Minolta Alpha/Maxxum/Dynax mount.</p>

<p>Note that Sony offers two full-frame models, the <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/camera.php?id=8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A900</a> and <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/camera.php?id=139"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A850</a>.

<p>Note that Sony also has non-DSLRs that use the Alpha mount. These are cropped-sensor cameras with a translucent mirror and electronic viewfinder (EVF) which are lighter than DSLRs and have special features like full autofocus during video recording and during 10 FPS continuous shooting.

Any advice or pointers are welcome, thanks.  I'm heading out towards much less light polluted areas middle of next week and I want to try some nighttime sky captures with my 7D.</p>

<p>Additional info: I just found <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Milky_Way_Night_Sky_Black_Rock_Desert_Nevada.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">this picture</a> on wikipedia that says: 54s, tripod mounted 5D, 16mm lens, f/2.8, ISO800. What else do I need to be aware of? My 7D is only an APS-C and the widest lens I have is 19mm. I'm thinking that might not be wide enough to capture an interesting shot?</p>
","<p>Let me answer the question by amalgamating suggestions made by several posters throughout the already provided answers and comments. Hopefully these suggestions taken together will help yield the best possible results.</p>

<p><strong>- Know where the Milky Way is</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, knowing which way to point the camera is important, but actually spotting the Milky Way with your eyes is next to impossible. Know where the Galaxy is in the sky by using recognizable constellations as landmarks. There are programs that can help you familiarize with the sky including Stellarium, Google Sky and for Android Mobiles SkEye, to name a few. There are quite a few available.</p>

<p><strong>- Choose a time and a location</strong></p>

<p>In order to capture the best image there are some important factors to consider. You need to be away from light pollution, so select as remote a location as possible, away from city lights and other significant sources; a cloudless night with no moon. You can Google for moonrise and moonset times. Generally, avoid nights with a full moon. When the moon is waning (after full but before new moon) it will be absent from the sky for the first few hours after sunset, and if it is waxing (after new but before a full moon) you will do best to shoot in the morning hours. Best yet, shoot during a new moon. It won't be in the sky at night.</p>

<p>Also choose arid conditions over moist; directly after rain is a good time. And prefer high altitude locations to lower.  The atmosphere is thinner the higher you are and will have less of a distorting effect on the stars.</p>

<p><strong>- Select a lens</strong></p>

<p>You will most likely want to get at least a 40 degree field of view in the frame so you don't want anything more than 50mm for a full frame or around 30mm for a crop sensor. Faster lenses (larger apertures) will allow you to choose shorter shutter times to minimize star trails, and so will wider angles (shorter focal lengths).</p>

<p><strong>- Select the correct exposure</strong></p>

<p>Obviously you want to maximize the amount of light you're working with, but there can be trade-offs for each of the dimensions you have to play with: ISO, shutter speed, and aperture.</p>

<p>First, select your largest aperture, then I would say, choose a shutter speed. Star trails will be a problem when the shutter is held open for more than a few seconds so there is a balance between minimum trails vs maximum light.  You can use the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/30263/what-is-the-rule-of-600-in-astrophotography"">rule of 600</a>. </p>

<p>Basically: </p>

<pre><code>shutter speed = 600 / focal length (for full frame sensors or) 
shutter speed = 400 / focal length (for crop sensors)
</code></pre>

<p>But the lower, the better for the sharpest image possible.</p>

<p>Then select the ISO that will work with this by using the following formula: </p>

<pre><code>ISO = 6000 * f-stop^2 / shutter
</code></pre>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>crop sensor, 15mm lens, at f/4.
shutter = 400 / 15mm (approx. 26s)
ISO = 6000 * 4^2 / 26 (approx. 3692 so choose ISO3200)
</code></pre>

<p>At least, that's a good starting point. experiment from there.</p>

<p><strong>- Shoot</strong></p>

<p>Above all, have fun.</p>

<p>Update: <strong>- optionally, use post-processing</strong></p>

<p>This will only be possible if you consider yourself a mathematically inclined computer programmer. I recently came across <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/magneticlobster/5941836830/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this amazing post</a> from flickr user <em>magnetic lobster</em>, who took multiple 20s photographs and combined them with a mathematical algorithm.

"Is there a trick to separate an old photo moisture-fused to glass?","20733","","<p>We have lived in some moist environments and a favorite photo, while it otherwise looks good, has large parts of it that appear to have bonded to the glass of its frame. Presumably this is due to small amounts of condensation getting between the photo and the glass. </p>

<p>Does anyone know a trick I can use to help me separate them cleanly? The photo is about 16 years old.</p>
","<p>Water does not harm photographic paper. After all, it is soaked in different waterbased chemicals during developing and washed in clean water in the end. So you'll be quite safe removing the glass along with the photo from the frame and sinking them in good clean lukewarm water with a couple of drops of liquid soap. Do not try to pry the photo off the glass by force. Gently rubbing the back of the photo should help water get in between the photo and glass. Expect result in a few minutes.</p>

<p>If the photo does not come free off the glass inside 20 minutes, it most likely is stuck forever. In that case
take the photo with glass off the water, wipe all loose water away and take the suggested (in comments) photograph of the photo thru the glass now that you just washed the glass clean and the photo looks good while still wet.</p>

<p>Disclaimer. This is safe method for photos printed (developed) on normal photographic paper. If the photo in question is <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/39075/how-to-tell-if-a-photo-is-not-developed-on-a-photographic-paper"">not of that material</a>, soaking in water may in some cases do great harm and destroy the photo irreversably. You should take a photograph of the photo thru the glass <em>before</em> attempting any other operations. Advice on how to best do a photographic copy may be found elsewhere on this site.</p>

"Does Expeed 3 make D3200 better than D5100?","20633","","<p>I am thinking of my buying my first DSLR and have narrowed down to D3200 and D5100. Given that their price is the same, I am having a tough time figuring out which one to buy:</p>

<ul>
<li>D5100 is the more advanced series of the two</li>
<li>D5100 has the swivel screen (that makes it easier to take photographs in certain situations where you cannot see the fixed screen when taking a photo)</li>
<li>D3200 is the newer one, has more mega pixels (which I don't care about, as I am not going to either take large prints or crop a lot)</li>
<li>D3200 is wifi enabled (thats great, but doesnt improve photo quality)</li>
<li>D3200 has the newer image processing chip - expeed 3</li>
</ul>

<p>Now this is where I get flummoxed - does the expeed 3 make enough of a difference? Does it improve image quality enough to overtake the quality of a more advanced series of camera.</p>

<p>D5200 is out my budget - or rather I spend the extra money on a lens than a costlier body, so 5200 is out question.</p>
","<p>While I don't think that your question is important when choosing your camera, I think it cannot be answered. </p>

<h1>Not the Answer</h1>

<ol>
<li>Both cameras take great pictures with their respective processors.</li>
<li>Other factors could be more important to you.

<ul>
<li>Get the D5100, if you liked to use either:

<ul>
<li>Bracketing (for HDR or something else)</li>
<li>Timelapse functionality (built into the D5100; you could buy an external adaptor for the D3200)</li>
<li>Swivel screen for video, use on a tripod, or near the ground. (I find that very useful!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get the D3200 if you like more megapixel or a bit of additional zoom (through cropping). Get the D3200 if you want wifi.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h1>Answer</h1>

<p>Except for Image Quality, I don't think it can be answered (at least by me, now) because we know too little about the two processors.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>The Expeed 3 is said to be quicker (but how much?) and ""better"". However, the D3200 has more megapixels and needs more processing power, so the gain in speed is required! Given that both cameras can shoot 4 fps in burst mode, I would assume that there is no real speed increase that isn't also offset by the higher pixel count on the newer D3200.</p>

<p>Also notice, that one only notices speed improvements if they are above 30%. This is a <em>rule of thumb</em> that is used with computers. If your change in the system gives you only 10% improvement but has some downsides, it is not worth doing.</p>

<h2>Image Quality</h2>

<p>The image quality is exactly the same. Okay, not true. But unless you know exactly what you want to do (i.e. only shoot portraits), it might as well be the same.</p>

<p>Because of the higher density sensor of the D3200 the individual pixels are smaller and thus you loose high ISO performance and dynamic range. The better processor seems to keep up with it, though!</p>

<p>The following data are from DxOMark and show three categories of image quality of the two cameras. Essentially the values are almost <strong>the same</strong>. If you decide that good high ISO performance is important to you, that the improvement of the D5100 become relevant to your decision making, I suggest you pick a completely different camera (used D700 for example but see DxO mark for that).</p>

"What is a kicker?","20596","","<p>In lighting, what is a kicker and when should I use it? (And is it any different from hair light?)</p>
","<p>I'd usually use the term <em>kicker</em> to refer to any highly off axis light which strikes a glancing blow on the subject. This creates a highlight or gradient over a small area of the image in order to accent the area, define shape.</p>

<p>I [over]use this type of light mostly in portraiture, where primarily it helps define the unlit side of the face. It also adds drama, gives the image a modern look, here's a comparison with and without the kicker:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/kicker_no_kicker.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/kicker_no_kicker.jpg</a></p>

<p>It can be more subtle than this, as in the following image. I find a tiny bit of light on the off side almost always improves a shot:</p>

<p><a href=""http://mattgrum.com/portfolios/portrait/images/amy2.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://mattgrum.com/portfolios/portrait/images/amy2.jpg</a></p>

<p>The kicker can have the effect of fattening the face a little so there are times when the standard short lighting pattern is preferable. Here's a not so subtle kicker using a bare strobe to the left:</p>

"Why does my Lightroom/Photoshop preview change after loading?","20518","","<p>Everybody who is using Lightroom probably has seen this:</p>

<p>You have imported RAW files. Lightroom shows a preview, but contrast and color of the preview change after a few short seconds to a slightly different view.</p>

<p>For some users the change is small, for others the change is huge: colors are different (read: wrong), contrast is off.</p>

<p>Rumor says this is happening only (more?) for Nikon users.</p>

<p>What is Lightroom doing here? </p>

<p>I'd guess as first preview LR is showing the JPG preview file, which is embedded in the RAW file, then LR renders the RAW file itself and is showing it's own interpretation.</p>

<p>But why is this interpretation so different to the embedded JPG?</p>
","<p>You're right in your conclusion that Lightroom is initially showing you the embedded jpeg. However, Adobe isn't privy to how the camera manufacturers process their jpegs in-camera, so Lightroom is never going to be able to produce thumbnails/previews/images that match the jpegs SOOC.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that the main issue is whether you are happy with your ability to use Lightroom to produce images in post-processing that you are happy with.  If you are, then I (along with countless others) don't think it really matters whether Lightroom's interpretation is the same as the jpegs that came out of the camera.</p>

"Can I use vintage lenses on Nikon D3200","20490","","<p>I tried researching this but I kept getting contradictory answers - is it possible to use vintage/film lenses on Nikon D3200 (with lens adapters if necessary)? If so, are these lenses limited to Nikon, or can Canon, Pentax etc lenses be used too?</p>

<p>Also am I correct to assume that the Canon 600D can use most vintage/film lenses with the correct lens adapters?</p>
","<p>What matteres is not the manufacturer of a lens, but its <em>lens mount</em>.
In fact, there are two things that have to be considered.</p>

<p>First and most important aspect is probably the <em>flange focal distance</em>. This is the distance from the mounting flange (the metal ring on the camera and the rear of the lens) to the film plane.<br>
In order to achieve infinit focus, this distance is essential. Every lens mount has a different one. Look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_mount#List_of_lens_mounts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this list</a> for reference. To be able to focus to infinity, the adapted lens has to have the same flange focal distance as the mount dictates.<br>
Let's look at an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Say you want to put a Nikon F-Mount lens on to your Canon EOS M. No problem at all! The Nikon lens is made for a flange focal distance of 46.50 mm. The Canon EF-M-mount has a distance of only 18mm. This means that you need an adapter that adds additional 28.5mm between lens and sensor.</li>
<li>Another one: You have a old Leica M39 lens, that you want to put on your D3200. The lens is made for a flange distance of 28.80mm, where the D3200 sports 46.50mm. That means that the lens is at least 17.7mm too short (not counted the addtional space that a adapter adds). In this case, the only thing you could probably do with that combination, is macro photography.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like mentioned, if you look at the linked table, don't forget, that an adapter adds some extra millimeters space.</p>

<p>Another thing to look out for is the <em>mount diameter</em>. If the diameter of the mount of the lens is larger than the diameter of the camera mount, the adapter has to be put entirely in front of the camera, adding some extra flange focal space.</p>

<p><strong>That said, there is a workaround, when adapting lenses with a small flange focal distance on a camera with a larger one:</strong><br>
There are adapters with a corrective lens built in, like <a href=""http://www.kipon-usa.com/kipon-m42-lens-to-nikon-f-camera-body-adapter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this <em>M42</em>-to-<em>Nikon F-Mount</em> adapter from Kipon</a>. That built in corrective lens tries to make up for the difference in flange distance.<br>
However, as this adds another glass element (<em>and most adapters are too cheap that they could possibly be of higher quality glass</em>), there is a high propability that this affects image quality negatively.</p>

<p>Second aspect to think about, is the built in electronics.<br>
If you adapt a old lens to your camera, you will most likely end up with complete manual control of your exposure and focus. Old lenses had no <em>auto-focus</em>, and no transmitting of <em>exposure settings</em>, like aperture.<br>
Higher end cameras, like the Nikon D800 are able to measure the exposure and so work at least in aperture priority mode, setting the shutter speed automatically, addtional to the manual mode. Entry level cameras like the D3200 can't do that with non-CPU lenses and have to be operated fully manual, as they can't determine that a lens is put on without the CPU.</p>

"What is a ""2.2X Pro Telephoto"" lens?","20371","","<p>I am looking to enter the world of SLR cameras and learning some more about lenses. I came across a package that has a <code>2.2X pro Telephoto</code> what exactly does that mean and how does it work?  (Please explain it in lay terms I am new to the lingo here)</p>
","<p>I'm assuming you mean this: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000Y9YFDA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raynox DCR-2025, Pro 2.2x Telephoto Lens for Digital Still Cameras</a>. In this case, beware of the word ""pro"", as it doesn't mean anything — Raynox just sticks that on <em>all</em> of their similar products to make them sound fancier. It's also disingenuous and confusing for Raynox to call this a ""telephoto lens"", because it isn't really.</p>

<p>This isn't a stand-alone lens, but is rather a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleside_converter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">teleside converter</a>"" made to increase effective focal length of a ""real"" lens. It's made to give additional options for digicams and camcorders without interchangeable lenses, and it works by using lenses to increase the width of the incoming beam of light. You could conceivably use this on an SLR lens, but I don't think you want to.</p>

<p>In general, they're not really a good deal, since even when you can't change lenses, you can often get better image quality just by cropping. That's because the additional optics destroy detail, so you loose image quality. Might as well lose image quality <em>for free</em> by cropping the image to just the detail you're interested in.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to use a teleconverter, the kind which goes <em>between</em> your primary lens and the camera usually offers better image quality, although that kind also restricts the effective aperture. But I think probably what you actually want is a real telephoto lens.</p>

I will post the result photo and you tell me the wrong things I am doing resulting in this! And how to fix it :)</p>

<p>Light was a Profoto B1 with a beauty dish (Profoto White Softlight 20.5"" Reflector) on an 8' stand.</p>

<p>Is it because the model has an angle towards the light, and the beauty dish should be right next to the camera? </p>

<p>Or should I light up the wall from ""opposite"" direction of the beauty dish?</p>

<p>Also can the shadow be removed with photoshop? :)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJ7AT.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJ7AT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>Despite the name of your modifier (Profoto White <strong>Soft</strong>light 20.5"" Reflector), this is no soft light at all. The light source is far away and small enough to produce hard light on the subject. The most common property that makes light hard or soft is how smooth the shadows are. This can be seen from the shadow under the chin on the neck. The shadow has a sharp edge, where <em>sharp</em> means ""the distance from full shadow to no shadow is very short"". There's barely a gradient visible.</p>

<p>Just to be clear here, this is not to say this is good or bad. Just to give it a name so you know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>The inherent property of soft light to make shadows transition more smoothly is caused by the angle of light. For soft light, the angle is very broad. For hard light it is narrow.</p>

<p>With a narrower angle, it takes a bigger distance<sup>1</sup> for a shadow cast by hard light to become soft. That's why the shadow is still visible on the wall. If you used softer light, the shadow would be softened so much that it would be less visible.</p>

<p>This means that you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As Rafael pointed out in <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/67232/35348"">his answer</a>, <strong>increase the distance from the model to the background</strong>. This gives enough room for the shadow to fall onto the ground where it is not part of the image any more. I want to add to this that if you are considering post processing anyway, you could consider using a white background. This has 2 advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can basically just overexpose it with another light source and not worry about any details in it that you want to keep because there are no details.</p></li>
<li><p>You can easily insert any background that you want in post processing via blend modes.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>As the shadow edges become less visible and the overall shadow more blurry with softer light, you could <strong>use softer light</strong>. In order to do this, you'd either have to use a bigger modifier to increase the size of the light source or move the source in closer. There are two potential problems with this</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The look will be significantly different, as the picture is now, the hard light is very punch, as in the middle of the day under harsh sun. With soft light, it will more look like an overcast day. Depending on how close you move in the light, it might only illuminate parts of the model and in turn look even more different.</p></li>
<li><p>The modifier/light source could reach into the frame. This is not a problem, because you can take an image of the background without the modifier/light source in it and remove the modifier/light source from the picture in post processing.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>conclusion</strong>: If you want to keep the hard punchy lighting, but get rid of the shadow, increase the distance between background and model. If you want to get rid of the shadow only and don't mind a different look of the image, use softer lighting or possibly and another light in addition to that as suggested in other answers.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little more creative thought (danger: opinion inside): So far 95% of the shot is the model and the pose. (dare I say 99%?) The lighting is not very interesting. A car produces that kind of light. (it'd have to be elevated to cast a shadow downwards, but still the same kind of light)</p>

<p>If that's the look you are trying to achieve, perfect.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <strong>embrace the shadow</strong>. You are using hard light and can get razor sharp shadow edges in your image, but so far the light is blowing out mostly all shadows on the model and the one on the background sure is annoying and not helping with anything at all. What if the shadow cast by the model becomes a part of the image instead of a bi-product of the lighting? Couldn't the rim of the hat throw an iconic shadow in the face? Contrary to what I suggested above: What if the model was leaning against the wall? If you move the light source closer to the wall, the shadows cast on the wall become longer and the shapes possibly more interesting. Can you make the the black of a shadow and the black of the dress merge into each other so the overall shape of the outline of the model becomes less obvious and thus more interesting?</p>

<p>Speaking of black, it is the only thing I'd be missing in the picture you are having right now. There's a black dress and black hat, but no true black in the image at all. There's so much light that even those blacks appear as dark grey in the image.</p>

Generally speaking, filtered digital sensors are sensitive to a much broader range of light than the human eye, from about 250nm (the near-UV range) through visible light (400nm to 750nm), and down about 780nm (the IR range). Unfiltered, a digital sensor is sensitive to a far greater range, from deep UV (200nm, true UV) down to true IR (as far as 900nm) <sup>[#1]</sup>. It should be noted that sensitivity is not constant throughout this range, and falloff is fairly rapid and becomes significant the farther away from 380nm you go. Same goes for the IR range. Human eyesight ranges on average from about 390nm through 700nm, while some people are more sensitive and able to see from about 380nm through 750nm.</p>

<p>Despite the filtration applied to digital sensors, UV light is still a problem, and can affect color balance. In general, the ability to sense UV light is not a huge problem, as digital sensors have relatively weak sensitivity to blue, and the UV sensitivity is generally captured as blue. However, without proper filtration, UV dispersion can generate disruptive haze that can be captured by a digital sensor, which may result in a rather undesirable result. </p>

<p>It should be noted that optical glass filters out a considerable amount of UV light. Most UV wavelengths up to around 310nm are blocked by the glass of a camera lens, and the remainder from 310nm up through 380nm can be blocked with a UV/Haze filter. If one wishes to create images in the UV light range, special lenses are available. Non-standard materials such as quartz or calcium fluoride have a greater transparency to the UV spectrum. From a camera imaging perspective, most research shows the most interesting UV wavelengths probably lie between 250nm and 310nm <sup>[#2]</sup>. To get a clear UV shot, you may need to remove the UV filter that covers the sensor itself. This is similar to removing the IR filter when modifying a camera for IR work, or may involve removing the entire filter apparatus, which would remove both UV and IR filters at the same time (depends on the camera.)</p>

","<p>This isn't possible on the 600D; you have to half-press the shutter to get autofocus.

"Adobe RGB to sRGB conversion, why does the color change?","20233","","<p>When I convert my photos from Adobe RGB colorspace to sRGB for browsers, the color slightly changes and I’m bothered by it. I know that sRGB covers a smaller space of colors so I won’t get an exact same result after conversion, but I still wonder if there is a way to get better results.</p>

<p>Of course it’s not a problem in cases when I start with converting and do the retouch afterwards, but many cases I either don’t want to do anything with the photos or forget to change the colorspace. So I would like to know if it can be converted without any noticable change, or should I just get used to it?</p>

<p>I used (Photoshop CS5) “Edit -> Convert to Profile”, I tried both Relative and Absolute Colorimetric, I checked all the boxes at the bottom (“Use Dither” and such). I also tried without those boxes checked, but it resulted almost the same, only a bit worse.</p>

","<p>If everything is working correctly, the difference should be subtle and you shouldn't 
generally notice a big shift.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion:</p>

<p>You may be working on a monitor which is not capable of rendering the whole Adobe RGB gamut. In this case, out-of-gamut colors are clipped or approximated (perhaps poorly). When you convert to sRGB, the colors are mapped more correctly and can be actually rendered, and you get the shift. In other words, the sRGB version was ""right"" all along — you just weren't seeing it. </p>

<p>This is one reason I recommend that most people work in sRGB even though bigger color spaces sound better.</p>

<p>The other possibility, if you're working in a nicely color-calibrated setup, is that your image <em>does</em> have a lot of tones not represented in sRGB and losing them <em>does</em> happen to make a big difference in the scene. In that case, there's nothing you can really do, although if web and sRGB are a large portion of your display audience you may want to take the time to do sRGB-specific color work. </p>

<p>This is kind of web-browser specific, but take a look at <a href=""http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/graphics/colorprofiles/default.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft's color management test page</a>, and in particular the ""image test"" link. In a properly-configured system, as you click between Adobe RGB, sRGB, and ProPhoto (click between the <i>or this</i>es), you'll see only very subtle changes. If your environment isn't set up correctly (in the browser test, including if you don't have proper browser support), the Adobe RGB and ProPhoto examples will look horribly washed out and wrong. (Viewing the page on my iPhone provides a great example of a browser with no proper color profile support.)</p>

<p>I did read a blog somewhere where is suggested that the inverse transform that is needed for proper deconvolution can be known since the blur that comes in our digital pictures comes from the needed anti-aliasing filters in the camera's hardware. This seems like a good theory to me. Except that that would only work for images that were focused properly, not blurry as a result of any hardware limitations.

Unfortunately the conclusion is that it's pretty much useless.
Picasa is a photo management app with basic editing and sharing functionality not a RAW post-processor.

<blockquote>
  <p>Although Picasa’s RAW support will do

"What ISO do I shoot Ilford Delta 3200 in?","19942","","<p>I need to make pictures in crummy lighting conditions (inside a convention center) without much ability for external light apart from my camera flash.</p>

<p>All my cameras (Nikon FG, FM10 and N80) support ISO 3200, so wouldn't I just set that and treat it like I treat my normal ISO 100/400 Films?</p>

<p>I saw some people having to use a lower ISO because of their cameras not going up that high and then utilizing Push-Processing, but I prefer not to worry about that as I'm still figuring things out and don't want a roll of 36 wrongly exposed pictures. I'm also not trying to achieve Art yet, for the most part I'm using Aperture Priority to get a feel for things like DOF, so I want to keep it simple.</p>
","<p>Shorter version: 
Expose it as 3200 and shoot normally. Develop according to the instructions and make sure you use the correct development time for 3200. </p>

<p>Longer version:
Delta 3200 is not an ISO 3200 film, it is more like ISO 1000-1200. If you expose it as 3200 and develop according to the instructions, you are actually push developing it. The film handles that well and it can be in fact shot even as 6400 (with appropriate push development) and some people push it even higher. The pushing comes at a price, though. The price is coarser grain and partial loss of the capability to handle underexposure and large tonal ranges. Exposing (and developing) it as, say, 1200 - 1600 will make it more forgiving. </p>

<p>I would not worry about it right now, shoot at 3200 and develop appropriately. At least first few rolls. If you find it lacking too much tonal range, is too grainy for your taste or that it is too unforgiving with underexposures, consider exposing as 1200 - 1600 and developing as 1600. Great developer for Delta 3200 is Ilford DD-X.</p>

"How do I take pictures of planes flying at an airshow?","19915","","<p>I would love to get some extra tips on shooting the variety of planes flying at an airshow. I think I am okay with the planes on the ground... but any tips on shutter speed, aperture or anything for the show up in the air?</p>
","<p>I use a combination of 2 lenses, a 300mm prime on a 1.4 extender for distant formations / individual aircraft and a 100-400 for the formation shots and stuff happening on the ground.</p>

<p>I tend to use AI Servo (I am a Canon user, I am sure someone will quote the appropriate mode on Nikon if required). For individual aircraft I usually set the focus point to the centre point only - for formations I let the camera suss out the focal point.</p>

<p>A lot of guys use aperture priority for jets but I prefer to use shutter priority because I mainly shoot propeller aircraft. I also dial in a couple of + points on the exposure bias and set the metering to center weighted partial metering. I don't use spot metering because on sunny days - you can get glints of sun off the aircraft and this can throw the metering hugely.</p>

<p>Shutter speeds - for propeller aircraft it depends a bit on the aircraft and what the aircraft is doing. On their take off roll they will be at a high power setting so the RPM will be higher. I would start off using 1/320 and practice your panning technique. This will stop you freezing the propeller (pet hate) and show some movement.</p>

<p>When the aircraft is displaying, they will change settings frequently - I tend to use 1/250 or 1/320 depending on the aircraft type. </p>

<p>When the aircraft are on final approach to land, the prop will be much slower as they will be throttling back alot, you will need to dial the shutter speed right down for these shots - 1/100 or lower probably. </p>

<p>For jets, crank the shutter speed up - they will be moving really really quickly, as high as you can manage while keeping the ISO at 100 (this allows you to crop into the images more if you need to while keeping the noise down)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YG6Qo.jpg"" alt=""F-86 Sabre""></p>

<p>Helicopters... tricky! Their RPM is really slow, you want to stick around 1/100 and fire off plenty of shots.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQage.jpg"" alt=""Royal Navy Lynx Helicopters""></p>

<p>Take a lot of memory cards and don't be afraid to hold the shutter down a bit when you first get started, with practice you will get better and can get more selective with when you're shooting.</p>

<p>Don't bother taking a tripod, they are a pain in crowds.</p>

<p>Composition: You want the aircraft to have some room to move into generally, really tight impact shots work well but you need to be very close in - if you leave a bit more space in front of the aircraft than behind they tend to work a bit better.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hHhcj.jpg"" alt=""Corsair Close Up""></p>

<p>Positioning: The big formations tend to centre their display midway down the flight line for their big breaks etc - for everything else, I usually like to be at one end or the other so you get nice take off shots or landing shots and some lovely topside shots as the aircraft bank in as they come round the bend.</p>

<p>You can always have some fun and try some silly slow shutter speeds, sometimes it pays off :)</p>

","<p>There are two things that I can think of to be aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The white balance of the film. Unlike digital raw shooting, it's not something you can easily correct after the fact and film is designed for specific lighting conditions. I should note that the porta 400 doesn't need correcting gels for electronic flash or daylight, <strong><em>but</em></strong> be sure that the color temperature of your flash is within that range.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to plan your lighting more carefully. Digital lets us be a little sloppy, we can test out some angles, play with strengths, and then see the result quickly and so then adjust. Not so with film. While the metering in your camera is fine for shooting with ambient light, it's not so useful with flash and you're best to spend a little time working with the guide numbers and distances to ensure correct lighting otherwise you may find you've expended the roll and under or over exposed.</p></li>

<p>Can someone please provide me with a top-to-bottom explanation of what a macro lens does?</p>
","<p>True macro lens gives you a 1:1 magnification -- that is a ratio of size of the subject and its image on the sensor. With 1:1 magnification on APS-C sensor (22&times;15 mm), you can fill whole picture with area of this size.</p>

<p>Other properties of macro lenses include that they have fixed focal lengths, usually very low distortion (see <a href=""http://www.photozone.de/canon-eos/167-canon-ef-100mm-f28-usm-macro-test-report--review?start=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">distortion figures of Canon EF 100mm macro</a> at photozone.de for example). Also, macro lenses tend to have non-rotating and non-moving front elements which is useful since you put them very close to the thing you're shooting.</p>

<p>Mostly due to marketing reasons, term <em>macro</em> is now used for lenses with 1:2 or even lower magnification. (<a href=""http://www.tamron.com/lenses/prod/28200_di_a031.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tamron AF28-200mm F/3.8-5.6 XR Di Aspherical (IF) Macro</a> has 1:4, which means on APS-C body the smallest area you'll focus on is 88&times;60 mm.)</p>

<p>On compact cameras, macro means ""setting where you can focus a bit closer"". (Although, as Roddy points out, this can sometimes get you close to actual macro range: Panasonic TZ5 <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonictz5/page3.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">can capture</a> a 63&times;47mm area, which gives results similar to lens with 1:3 magnification on APS-C DSLR -- image quality aside)</p>

<p>Also, what file format is best?</p>
","<p>The straightforward answer to your question is very simple arithmetic: 32×300 = 9600 and 18×300 = 5400, so 32 inches by 18 inches at 300 dots per inch is 9600 by 5400.</p>

<p>However, it gets a little more complicated when you consider a more complicated relationship between pixels and colored dots in your output medium. For details on this, take a look at jrista's answer to a similar question: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/4781/1943"">What DPI should I resize my image to for best printing quality?</a>, at <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2041/what-does-dpi-mean"">What does DPI mean?</a>, and at <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/456/is-there-a-general-formula-for-image-size-vs-print-size"">Is there a general formula for image size vs. print size?</a></p>

<p>Also consider that 300dpi may be overkill for a poster, unless you expect your viewers to come right up to it and look closely. A much lower resolution will look great from a few feet away.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're doing something specific, though. In that case, the best answer is to <em>ask your print service</em> what they recommend — and the same thing goes for file format (and color space, a whole 'nuther can of worms). </p>

<p>If your print service offers multiple file types as an option, lossless TIFF or PNG will ensure that you don't introduce additional JPEG artifacts, but in practical terms you can get excellent results from a high-quality JPEG. (With high enough JPEG quality and no repeated edits, you probably will not be able to find experts who could tell the difference in a blind test.)</p>

"How iPhone 5S can have such a big aperture? f/2.2?","19739","","<p>I thought that in order to have a big aperture such as f/2.2 a big amount of light should be able to enter to the sensor and in order to do it, a big lens was needed.</p>

<p>How is it possible that in the iPhone 5S, which has such a small camera lens, the aperture can be so wide?</p>
","<p>Firstly the iPhone 5 lens <em>has</em> to be f/2.2, due to the small pixel size, the effects of diffraction which start to creep in at f/11 on a DSLR, start to creep in at f/1.45 on a 5.6mm (diagonal) sensor!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I though that in order to have a big aperture such as f/2.2 a big amount of light should be able to enter to the sensor and in order to do it, a big lens was needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The figure f/2.2 actually means a large amount of light <em>per unit area</em>. Given the tiny sensor in the iPhone 5, this means there is still a small amount of light overall being transmitted by the lens.</p>

<p>An f/2.2 lens has an entrance pupil (the apparent size of the aperture when looking through the centre of the lens) whose diameter is equal to the focal length divided by 2.2</p>

<p>The focal length of the iPhone lens is 4.1mm so the entrance pupil is 1.86mm, which is not difficult to achieve in a small package. Compare this to a 35mm f/2.0 lens for a DSLR, which has an entrance pupil which is 17.5mm in diameter!</p>

<p><strong>Aside #1: entrance pupil diameters</strong></p>

<p>From the above it would seem to be the case that ultra-wides with focal lengths of 8mm and f-stops of 4.0 for large APS-C sized camera sensors should be the same size as the iPhone lens as the entrance pupil is hardly any larger. However these lenses are many, many times larger. To explain why we need to go a bit deeper into lens design.</p>

<p>In order to be precise I use the term ""entrance pupil"", instead of the ""physical aperture"" (the hole in the lens barrel where the iris is located). The important factor for lens performance is not how large the aperture is, but how large it <em>appears</em> to be from the outside world. The Canon 600mm f/4 lens has an entrance pupil that is a whopping 150mm wide! Yet the aperture itself is located in the middle of the lens where there is clearly no space for a 150mm opening.</p>

<p>So you might read from this that a large entrance pupil lens doesn't have to be physically large, however in order for the aperture to appear to be 150mm wide, the opening at the front of the lens has to be at least 150mm. And if you look at the Canon 600mm f/4 clear this is the case with a dinner plate sized front element!</p>

<p>Entrance pupil size and front element diameter are extremely well correlated for longer focal lengths, but as you get into ultrawides the correspondence stops. Our 8mm f/4.0 lens should have a tiny front element. The answer is that for a lens to be f/4.0 the physical hole in the lens, that appears to be 2mm wide, must be visible from across the whole field of view, which is considerable; hence a large bulbous front element.</p>

<p>Due to the smaller sensor the iPhone lens has a much smaller field of view compared to its focal length, hence the range of angles the physical aperture has to be visible from is much reduced, allowing the front element (and thus the size of the lens as a whole) to be much smaller than that of the APS-C lens.</p>

<p><strong>Aside #2: phone camera lens design</strong></p>

<p>Having a small f-number like f/2.2 is not only associated with large lenses but expensive lenses also. Whilst f/2 lenses appear on some compacts, they tend to be high end models. So the obvious question is how the iPhone camera achieves a relatively large apertures at a price that is economical for inclusion in a smart phone.</p>

<p>The answer to this question is that the lens is made from aspherical plastic elements. Asphericals made of glass are very expensive to manufacture, however the iPhone lens is so small they can be molded from plastic, which is cheap but only works for small elements as the plastic would expand/contract too much on heating when scaled up.</p>

<p>The Nokia 808 PureView is the best example of this, being a five element all aspherical design, which would cost an absolute fortune to make from glass (if it were even possible with today's processes) and reportedly outresolves the Zeiss 50 f/2 (taking the image circle into account). See this link for more info, including a cross section of the lens image showing the sort of curves that DSLR lens designers can only dream of!</p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using auto ISO on a DSLR?","19719","","<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using auto ISO on a DSLR?</p>

<p>Using manual ISO obviously gives you more control, but auto ISO may mean that you get ""the shot"" under quickly changing conditions (such as street photography, varying quickly between direct sunlight, shade, indoor lighting. </p>

<p>Is auto ISO a convenient feature or a bad habit?</p>
","<p>Hardware ISO control exists to amplify the signal before readout to maximise the signal to noise ratio. Without read noise you wouldn't need ISO if you had a high 
precision ADC as you could simply shoot everything at the native sensitivity, and if the image was too dark just apply digital gain (multiply the pixel values).</p>

<p>It's easy to demonstrate this effect. The following two images had the same shutter speed and aperture. The top one was shot at the metered ISO 1600, the bottom one was shot at ISO 100, which resulted in underexposure which was fixed in photoshop: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZRvo.jpg""></p>

<p>The ISO 100 image is noisier, on account of read noise being amplified when the exposure is fixed. The ISO 1600 is amplified before readout so read noise is much lower.</p>

<p>As such ISO is not a creative control (like shutter speed and aperture) it is a practicality, required by the need to overcome noise. Contrary to popular opinion using a lower ISO wont give you less noise. Unless you also decrease shutter speed or open the aperture, both of which can result in a different looking image.</p>

<p>I don't consider it ""lazy"" to use auto-ISO, as the camera is not altering the creative controls, it's just trying to minimise read noise for you.</p>

<p>With auto-ISO in manual the pros and cons are pretty clear:</p>

<p>+ You can adapt to changeable lighting whilst sticking to your preferred aperture and shutter speed</p>

<p>- You're still at the mercy of the camera's light meter, you can get overexposure if the meter gets confused (which wouldn't happen if you fix the ISO to a low value).</p>

<p>- Some cameras don't offer exposure compensation with auto-ISO meaning if the metering is consistently off due to scene content you might not be using the optimal noise reducing ISO.</p>

<p>Using auto ISO in either program, shutter priority or aperture priority is slightly different as there are two or three values for the camera to choose, and the ISO value is no longer simply dependent on the light reading.</p>

<p>+ You'll be able to use preferable shutter speeds aperture more of the time than if ISO sensitivity was fixed.</p>

<p>- You're at the mercy of the auto-ISO algorithm, you're still letting the camera make creative decisions. </p>

"How was the Blade Runner replicant eye reflection effect done?","19682","","<p>I'm trying to recreate the Blade Runner eye reflection effect found in these examples:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MLuoP.gif"" alt=""Blade Runner - Android""></p>

<p>The closest I've seen is with a flash where the light bounces off in the eye and causes a bright red or white pupil but that would be inconvenient during a live shot like the movie. I've tried shining a bright light angled between the light, my eye, and the camera without much success.</p>
","<p>This effect was done by shining light directly in the same path as the lens. A half-translucent/half-reflective mirror (as in a ""two-way"" mirror) was placed in front of the lens at a 45 degree angle, and a beam of light directed on to that.</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>         subject


           \    
darkness     \         &lt;-- light
               \

            ^
         camera
</code></pre>

<p>The light would shine half through the mirror and half be reflected onto the subject; the camera's image would be half from the subject and half from whatever is to the left; to avoid that being an issue, one would presumably mask that with dark cloth to absorb the light shining through and avoid reflecting it back. </p>

<p>One could also use a ring flash to obtain a similar ""on-axis"" lighting effect, although of course the characteristic reflections would be ring-shaped, not the full circles seen in the replicants' eyes.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.theasc.com/magazine/mar99/blade/pg2.htm"">this article in the American Society of Cinematographer's magazine</a> for more on how these effects were done, including quotes from the film's cinematographer, Jordan Cronenweth.

"What is T-number / T-stop?","19654","","<p>Usually, when discussing aperture of a lens, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/594/what-does-f-stop-mean"">F-stop</a> and F-number are used for quantifying. But some photographers, and especially videographers, also mention T-stop. The concept and numbering used (e.g. T/3.4) seem to be similar to F-stops.</p>

<p>What is a T-stop, how is it related to F-stop, and what are the differences?</p>
","<p>F-stops are purely geometrical, the ratio of aperture to focal length, regardless of actual light transmitted. But all lenses absorb a part of the light passing through them, and the amount being absorbed varies lens to lens. So, in situations where even the slightest change of lights being transmitted affect the output, i.e cinematography, where many images are seen in rapid succession and even small changes in exposure will be noticeable, T-Stop is used as an standard. Since all lenses absorb some light, the T-number of any given aperture on a lens will always be greater (less light transmission) than the f-number. For example, a lens with f-stop 2.8 can have a t-stop 3.2, meaning a small portion (about a quarter) of the transmitted light has been absorbed by the lens glass elements.</p>

<p>A real lens set to a particular T-stop will, by definition, transmit the same amount of light as an ideal lens with 100% transmission at the corresponding f-stop. A f/2.8 lens can have t/3.2 and another f/2.8 lens can have t/3.4, so the actual lights being transmitted are not the same though they both have the same f-stop.</p>

"What is split portrait lighting?","19629","","<p>Ok, so I got interested enough in the other lighting setups, what is split portrait lighting and when is it appropriate to use?</p>
","<p><strong>What is Split Lighting?</strong></p>

<p>Split Lighting is one of the 5 basic lighting setups used in studio portrait photography. Split lighting at its most basic level is constructed with a single light source placed 90 degrees offset from the subject and a bit higher than eye level, lighting one half of the face, and leaving the other in shadow. </p>

<p>The thing that distinguishes Split Lighting from Short or Broad lighting is the placement of the subject’s head- Split Lighting is always taken with the subject facing square to the camera, unlike Short, Broad, and Rembrandt lighting which all have the subject’s head angled in relation to the camera.</p>

<p><em>One-light Split Lighting setup:</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wREqs.jpg"" alt=""One-light Split Lighting setup diagram"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QIgy4.jpg"" alt=""One-light Split Lighting setup example""></p>

<p><strong>When do I Use Split Lighting?</strong></p>

<p>Split lighting is a very ‘moody’ lighting option, so it is generally used when the photographer wants to create a strong sense of drama with the image. It is less frequently used in portrait photography because generally people want to see a subject’s <em>whole</em> face in a picture, though it does go in and out of fashion for commercial and advertising photography every few years. This is often referred to as ‘the comic book villain’ lighting style, and indeed, many comic artists use this technique when they are portraying the bad-guy in their comic books. Whereas Short Lighting and Rembrandt Lighting are 'everyday' lighting choices and the vast majority of portraits will use one of these lighting setups, Split Lighting is an 'accent' lighting choice... A session with a small number of Split Light portraits can add some variety, but a little goes a long way and an entire session of Split Light portraits can become boring very quickly.</p>

"What is ""Highlight Tone Priority""?","19614","","<p>This seems to be available in most of recent Canon cameras. I am curious how it works, and how it is different from the Auto Lighting Optimizer. Is it a useful function?</p>
","<p>Highlight tone priority is a camera mode that internally fiddles with exposure to preserve as much detail as possible in the ""highlight range"" of tones...the brightest tones in a photograph. It does this, however, at the cost of tones in the shadow range, as the ultimate effect is a shift of the histogram down towards the shadows. The cost of shadow tones is a bit less than the gain in highlight tones, however it is something to be aware of. </p>

<p>It should also be noted that HTP affects both RAW and JPEG images. This is in contrast to Automatic Lighting Optimizer, which applies an alternative tone curve when processing the sensor output for saving to JPEG. ALO only affects JPEG images, and has the tendency to compress dynamic range...thus costing you in your overall tonal range. </p>

","<p>Nikons have a reputation of coming from the factory with a little too much oil on the shutter mechanisms. Some of the excess oil eventually finds its way onto the sensor. What you are seeing in your photos is the shadow of the oil (and the dust stuck to it) on your sensor. You will probably have to go through several cycles of cleaning your sensor before the problem will gradually go away. Any type of dust spots on the sensor (actually on the IR filter in front of the sensor) will be darker, sharper, and more noticeable when shooting with narrower apertures than when shooting with wider apertures.</p>

<p>In the second case, it's the details. The hand photograph has big areas of the same color, a lot of blur, and very many sharp lines. That's ideal for compression. The bikes and trees are full of contrast and intricate detail. That's much harder to compress.</p>

","<p>Better is a relative term and, to some degree, will vary in terms of amount between the two depending on a variety of factors including the bit-depth, frequency of discrete colours, etc. Some experimentation may be necessary on this front, though my reading indicates LZW is good for lower bit-depth images with lots of the same colours and tones in it and ZIP for when that is not the case. In other words, if the image is 8 bits go LZW and if it is 16 bits go with ZIP, as a rule of thumb, but with the caveat that it's not an absolute rule and there may be exceptions.</p>

<p>The only other thing I'd note is that LZW has been in the TIFF standard since 1992 and ZIP since 2002 (as part of a supplement when Adobe added it). While that's probably more than enough time for it to no longer be an issue, there may be the odd piece of software out there that handles LZW compression but not ZIP.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I kind of want to experiment with this guy. And quality FD lenses are relatively cheap on the used market, so if the adapters were worth it, I could probably get more (and more varied) glass. On the other hand, everything I read about the FD-EOS adapters is highly contradictory. As in, some people swear by them, and others think they're outright tripe.</p>

<p>I am still within the exchange period, and can easily exchange this lens for this <a href=""http://www.adorama.com/CA5018AFU.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">50mm prime</a> that I'd been tossing up about buying anyway, as they are the same price.</p>

<p>Which would be the wiser choice?</p>
","<p>Generally I'd say it's not worth trying to adapt an FD lens for the EF mount. The reason for this is that the EF mount has a larger registration distance, that is distance from the sensor the mount so that any simple FD to EF adaptor will act like an extension tube and you wont be able to focus beyond a few meters!</p>

<p>Canon produced an adaptor with a glass element which corrected focus distance but increased focal length by a factor of 1.1, could only be used with telephotos and decreased optical quality. This adaptor was mainly produced to placate those with a significant investment in long Canon glass and is quite rare. This is probably the reason people consider this type of adaptor to be ""tripe"". There are also third party versions of this adaptor which are comparable to the Canon one (i.e. still not that good).</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, as the lens in question is a macro lens, you could use a simple mechanical adaptor and the result would be a <em>decrease</em> in minimum focus distance, increasing magnification. So if you plan to use this lens for macro work then you should be able to adapt it no problem, however it wont be useful for anything else. A glassless adaptor wont compromise the optics so this is probably responsible for the mixed opinions on adaptors.</p>

<p>At the very least you need an adaptor with that can engage the aperture lever so you can stop down (almost essential for macro work) I think most of the glass ones do this, if you can't find a mechanical adaptor which will work the aperture for you, you can remove the glass from one of the other adaptors.</p>

<p>Incidentally, that 50 f/1.8 is well worth the price so I would leave it on the shopping list even if you keep the macro, for when you can afford it.</p>

"How to control both aperture and shutter speed for casual portraits","19294","","<p>I took a number of ambient light portraits on Friday and I'm a little disappointed by the amount of motion blur (not camera shake) on parts of the subject. Altering the lighting was not an option.</p>

<p>I was using a 50mm f/1.8 lens and shooting at f/1.8 in aperture priority mode. My Canon EOS 5D Mk II was frequently setting the shutter speed to 1/40 or 1/50 of a second, and this was quite often not fast enough to stop blurring of the subject. Even the gentle swinging of an earring was causing blurring at 1/40, and small movements in the head or hands would make an otherwise nice shot disappointing.</p>

<p>My question is: how do you force the camera to use the desired aperture, and also specify a shutter speed of at least (say) 1/125 of a second, forcing the camera to use a higher ISO (if necessary) in exchange for a faster shutter speed?</p>

<p>[In case it's of interest, a typical exposure from this scene was f/1.8 for 1/40 at ISO 200.]</p>
","<p>With the Canon EOS 5D mark II, the best way to accomplish what you want is to set the exposure mode to <strong>Tv</strong>, the shutter speed to the desired setting (i.e. 1/125 sec.), and the ISO to <em>Auto</em>. As long as the light is fairly dim, the camera will first open the aperture to the lens' maximum and then start raising the ISO. This method will only work if you are happy using the lens' maximum aperture.</p>

<p>There is no way on the 5DII to set a minimum shutter speed when in <strong>Av</strong> exposure mode. If you select <em>Auto ISO</em> and any aperture, the camera will lower the shutter speed to around 1/focal length before it starts raising the ISO. Using <strong>P</strong> exposure mode will get basically the same results as <strong>Av</strong> mode with the aperture wide open in dim light.</p>

<p>Experimenting in <strong>Av</strong> mode with my 5DII by gradually reducing the amount of light entering the lens:</p>

<ul>
<li>With an EF 50mm f/1.4 lens the shutter speed has to drop to 1/40 sec. before the ISO starts going up. Once the ISO reaches 3200, then the shutter speed is lengthened even more.</li>
<li>With the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS lens at 105mm the shutter speed stops going lower at 1/125 sec until the ISO is up to 3200 and then the shutter speed will drop as far as necessary (over 1 sec with a lens cap on).</li>
<li>With the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS lens at 24mm the shutter speed will drop to 1/20 sec. before the ISO starts to go up. Once maxed at ISO 3200, the shutter will then drop even slower.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <strong>M</strong> exposure mode, when ISO is set to <em>Auto</em> it stays at ISO 400 and uses the Tv and Av you have manually set, regardless of the amount of light entering the lens. If you are using an E-TTL flash in <strong>M</strong> mode, the flash power will be automatically adjusted to properly expose the scene.</p>

<p>I hear that after emptying the card out (transferring images to a computer), that it's a good time to format it to help reduce the chance for error/corruption.  Is this true?</p>

  <p>Formatting your card(s) ensures any
  folder or file corruption acquired
  anywhere goes away.</p>
  
  <p>You can shoot without doing this,
  however constant formatting is good
  practice and should eliminate ever
  having any card errors. Be sure you've
  downloaded and backed up all the files
  in two different physical locations
  before formatting.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>I format my card every time I stick it in my camera and start a shoot. </p>

<p>I do this for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>First, it means every time I start a shoot, I don't accidentally leave the previous shoot on it (and it also means I don't delete it until I start the next shoot, by which time those images are safely on various backup disks; gives me an emergency backup on the card until I'm sure I've got multiple copies elsewhere).</p>

<p>Second, I use multiple camera bodies, and I know people who've had corruption issues with cards formatted by the computer (which I never do) or by one body and used in another because the bodies interact with the card slightly differently. By formatting every time, I know the formatting is what the camera wants and is expecting.</p>

<p>Third, formatting at the start of the shoot will (or should!) catch a card that is starting to fail. At the least, it'll catch some early failure modes in the card -- and in two cases for me so far, it has. So if the card hits an error during format, I know to immediately retire it. I'd rather find out I have a card error at the START of the shoot that midway into it, or worse, when I'm trying to read the images out later. </p>

<p>Note: any time I get a card error, I retire that card. Cards are cheap. Dead cards that eat my only copy of an image is expensive. And formatting a card every time means that every time I shoot gives me a blank slate in a known state that hasn't reported an error. Which means many fewer potential problems later. And FWIW, I basically never run into corrupted cards, lost images or problems during a shoot or during a post-shoot import. </p>

<p>Even if it means the card will wear out sooner, I don't care. I want reliable cards, not ancient ones. I'll happily replace them rather than try to recover images from them....</p>

<ul>
<li>What is back/frontfocus?</li>
<li>What causes back/frontfocus?</li>
<li>Is there any preventive measure to avoid getting back/frontfocus?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Front focus is when the lens and camera focus in front of your intended focus point.  Your subject will look slightly out of focus and something in front of them will be razor sharp in focus.</p>

<p>Back focus is correspondingly when something behind them is in focus, instead of your intended subject.</p>

<p>As to why.. it could be mis-aligned, mis-calibrated equipment. It could be you or it could be your subject.  You or your subject could have moved slightly after focusing and this would also cause front or back focus.  </p>

<p>In terms of why it would be this way for the equipment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Things may be out of spec from the factory, due to poor QA.  </li>
<li>Things could be in an acceptable QA range, but your combination of camera and lenses could be at opposite ends of the acceptable range.  </li>
<li>Your autofocus could be not properly functioning due to a software issue (this seems to be the case for the Pentax K-x camera with tungsten light sources...go figure).  </li>
</ul>

<p>There's a host of <em>why</em>, but most of them boil down to something being not quite calibrated, aligned, or working 'properly'.</p>

<p>Modern choices to fix it usually include one of three options that I'm aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Send your camera and lens to the manufacturer to be 'fixed' or calibrated.</p></li>
<li><p>Your camera may have a global adjustment in which you can tell it to always adjust its autofocus front or backwards by a small adjustable amount.</p></li>

"What is the effect of a scratched lens?","19161","","<p>I have a lens with a small but significant looking scratch near the center. But I don't see any difference in the photos. Where does the imperfection show up? How important is it to get the piece of glass replaced? (It's a Panasonic 14-45mm micro 4/3 lens).</p>
","<p>Most of the time, the scratch will show up as a small and perhaps even unnoticeable amount of softening in the image. (It will largely be ""outvoted"" by the vast majority of the light, which is being focused properly.) In high contrast situations, though, or when the light is striking the lens directly, there may be a significant mount of flare washing out the image and reducing overall contrast.</p>

<p>The scratch will probably also make the lens element more fragile, so it will likely to be easier to crack that lens element if the lens is dropped or given a good bump -- that depends on the type of glass.</p>

<p>Fixing it isn't a critical emergency unless it interferes with the kinds of pictures you want to take, but if you plan to keep the lens for a long time, it would be a good idea to get it repaired at some point.</p>

"How do I get the best results when photographing a christening?","19107","","<p>I take some halfway decent photos and have been asked by a family friend to photograph her daughter's christening. I have a Canon EOE350D camera, a 50mm f/1.8 lens and an 18-55mm f/5.6 kit lens, but no flash other than the one that's built-in to the camera. I've also got a tripod and a remote release cable.</p>

<p>I don't want to let my friend down; nor do I want to spend the afternoon taking photos only to have a mere handful that are actually of any use.</p>

<p>Given my limited equipment, are there any tips and/or tricks that I can use to make sure that I give myself the best chance possible for getting some good photos on the day?</p>

<p>ETA: there are some great suggestions below - I can't accept them all as the 'correct' answer and I don't have the rep to upvote them all either. Thanks though!</p>
","<p>For tips you could start with the generic: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/164/what-are-your-easiest-beginner-tips?rq=1"">What are your easiest photography beginner tips?</a></p>

<h2>Specific Event Tips</h2>

<p>For your specific situation, I would recommend scouting the location at the same time of day that the christening is. Do this so you can have an idea of the lighting conditions and also give yourself some ideas of possible locations to shoot. Take some shots and get an idea of the shutter speed/ISO/aperture requirements of the location. The ambient lighting may differ on the day of the event, but this will at least give you a basis.</p>

<p>I wouldn't spend too much time with a tripod or shutter release. The subjects will be moving and you will want to move as well. You might use it for 1 or 2 shots but I wouldn't unless the rules of the event location require you to sit at the back the whole time anyways.</p>

<p>I am guessing that due to the limited lighting in most churches and the fact that you won't be using a flash - it will be a necessity to use the wide aperture of the 50mm f/1.8. Be careful not to use it for group shots at f/1.8 though, you will lose focus on quite a few people unless it is a very small 1-2 person group. You can narrow the aperture to f/4 or so to help with group shots.</p>

<p>I've been to two different types of christenings. Ones that take place during the mass when the church is full and ones that take place after. If you are doing it during the mass, it will be significantly harder, due to the limitations likely put on you. This might be why a longer telephoto lens would be needed, but that you don't have. But if it is after the mass and church is over, it is usually very easy to move around and get the angles you desire. This way is usually much more laid back.</p>

"Do different ""Picture styles"" affect RAW output?","18930","","<p>I was <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/16/what-are-the-first-few-photography-books-someone-should-read/777#777"">reading again</a> the manual of my camera (Canon 50D, but I am sure that each DSLR offer the same kind of functionality, albeit I don't know the exact names adopted) and noticed the issue of Picture styles which I had overlooked in my first reading. </p>

<p>In short I think that they are a collection of various calibration settings (more or less enhanced colours, things like that...). Those that are available on my camera are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard</li>
<li>Portrait</li>
<li>Landscape</li>
<li>Neutral</li>
<li>Faithful </li>
<li>Monochrome</li>
<li>3 user definable modes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These styles are so important to deserve a direct button just under the LCD screen of the camera (I guess this is useful for simplifying the use of the camera in the basic modes as opposed to manual / less automated ones).</p>

<p>And now for the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>These settings obviously affect the appearance of the picture ""as it comes out of the camera"". But given the raw file I assume that they are all equivalent, a style is <strong>not applying</strong> a <em>destructive transformation</em> to the raw data, isn't it? </li>
<li>Shooting raw, is there a reason to favor one of these styles (Neutral?) over the other? Up to now I have been using Standard.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a bonus (don't know if it deserves a separate question, in which case I will ask it again), what is the difference between Neutral and Faithful?</p>
","<p>Styles are indeed an information layer on top of the RAW image data. As you wrote, setting a style is a non destructive operation when you shoot RAW, and the RAW processor (DPP, for example) lets you change styles while developing the image.</p>

<p>If there is a reason to select a style, it is to take out yet another step in the development process. If you know beforehand what style you prefer, setting it on shoot-time will save you changing it in post (same logic applies to the other settable presets, like white balance, etc.).</p>

Any idea if there is a technology that allows me to use the lens on the 5d body?</p>
","<p>Is it possible? Yes. You can probably do this by physically modifying the lens. </p>

<p><strong>Is it safe? No.</strong> The rear element of some (most?) Canon EF-S lenses extends into the body when at the wide (18mm) end. This causes the mirror to hit the back of the lens, potentially damaging both the lens and the camera. </p>

<p>People <em>have</em> had success modifying EF-S lenses to fit on APS-H (NOT full-frame) bodies such as the 1D series, though the lens may not be safe to use at all focal lengths.</p>

"How do I get the 'equivalent' focal length for a DSLR lens for my camera?","18864","","<p>On my Nikon D3000, how do I figure the focal length equivalence? In other words, if I want a lens that is just like a 50mm lens on a 35mm film SLR, I need to multiply by a factor. What is the factor, and how is it derived?</p>

<p>Also, when I buy a new lens for it, and the box says 70mm-300mm, I assume that's the true focal length of the camera and not the equivalent, so I have to apply the factor. Is that correct?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What is the factor, and how is it derived?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The factor (also commonly called a 'crop factor') is a measurement of how much larger a full-frame image sensor is than the sensor in your camera. People say the D3000's crop factor is 1.5 because a full-frame sensor is 1.5x larger than the D3000 sensor.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-frame_digital_SLR"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full-frame sensor</a> is 36mm x 24 mm. The <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/news/2009/7/30/nikond3000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sensor in the Nikon D3000</a> is 23.6mm x 15.8mm.</p>

<p>Comparing the sensor sizes along each dimension:</p>

<p>36mm / 23.6mm = 1.52 (approximately)</p>

<p>24mm / 15.8mm = 1.52 (approximately)</p>

<p>You can see how the full-frame sensor is around 1.5x the size of the D3000 sensor, hence the 1.5x crop factor.</p>

"What are the dangers of removing a lens while the camera is on?","18839","","<p>The manual warns that you should turn the camera off to remove the lens, but it doesn't say why.</p>

<p>I suspect this may have to do with dust, but I could imagine there are lots of other reasons. I'm hoping someone can tell me the reason for doing this, so it will help me to never forget :-).</p>
","<p>When I get this question from my students, the underlying question is often based on the persistent myth that taking a lens off without first turning off the camera will 'fry' the lens, the camera, or both (depending on who you talk to).</p>

<p>With both Canon and Nikon cameras the leftmost pins on the body (when looking at the camera) are the VBat (6 volt lens power) pins, so when the lens is disengaged and rotated counterclockwise the first thing that happens is that power is removed from the lens. Since none of the other lens contacts sweep over the VBat pin, that scenario is actually physically impossible. Additionally, since the lens power is disengaged from the moment the lens is rotated, the lens is no longer able to pass information back through the communication (dcl and dlc) and clock (dclk) pins. Thus there is very little danger of bad data getting passed between the camera and the lens and somehow 'corrupting' anything unless you really <em>snap</em> the rotation of the lens and there ""happened"" to be communication going on at just the right moment. In any case, simply turning off the camera and turning it back on would clear such an error.</p>

<p>While I have no direct experience with the pin and contact patterns of other brands of SLR/dSLR, I would be very surprised if the others (Sony, Pentax, etc.) did it differently.</p>

<p>Assuming two light sources of equal size and relative intensity (let's say as an example monolights and the sun) and assuming that you're shooting raw to color balance, what's the difference between them, as far as quality of light?  Is it only spectrum?  Why would one produce a significantly different quality light than the other? </p>

<p>(I'm not interesting in the fact that one is easier to use or more flexible or always on or such - I'm more concerned with the <strong>quality</strong>.)</p>
","<p>""Only spectrum"" is a very major factor.   </p>

<p>The following only simplistically 'scratches the surface' of an immensely complex subject area:</p>

<p>""Colour temperature"" is a measure of the ""warmness"" of a white light source - this is a subject that rapidly descends in black (or white) magic and needs not be discussed here except as a means of comparing while light components. The colour temperature is the temperature that a black body radiator would need to be heated to to produce white light of the same equivalent ""warmth"". </p>

<p>Solar light is relatively continuously distributed in light frequencies.  </p>

<p>Light sources such as a tungsten or halogen bulb which used a heated metal to produce light have a relatively continuous spectrum across a limited range of frequencies. The tungsten peak is centred around longer wavelengths / lower frequencies than the daylight distribution and is yellower and of a lower effective colour temperature. </p>

<p>Artificial sources which excite phosphors with one wavelength of light to cause them to emit light at other wavelengths, produce light in a number of relatively sharp frequency peaks with gaps between with less or no light. These peaks of wavelength are arranged such that the eye / brain system combines them to produce ""white"" light. While the eye may see white, the discontinuous spectrum produces photographic effects which are different than continuous spectrum natural light. </p>

<p>This method applies to fluorescent lights, CFL (compact fluroescent), &amp; Phosphor LEDs. Similar results occur when a gas is exceited electrically or thermally so it emits light with sharply defined frequenices or when multiple mono-coloured LEDs are used. The resultant ""White"" is a phantasm of the brain. <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/PlanckianLocus.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source - CCA/SA</a>. The curved solid line is the ""Plankian locus"" and is the colour that a heated black body would follow as temperature rose. Numbers 1500-10000 are the temperatures in Kelvin causing the associated colour. <strong>THe eye and brain see colours on this line as versions of ""white""</strong> . The numbers around the outside of the coloured area are the wavelengths in nanometres of monochrome light at that point. Take any two points on the boundary, mix light using these two colours and alter the relative amplitudes and the effective colour will move along a line between the two. (It is not, alas, just a straight line drawn on this chart). Do this with 3 border co0lours and you can make colours which lie ~ inside the triangle formed by the 3 colours. BUT while you MAY be abale to make the eye/brain think you have a light of one colour, or a wide range of colours, a sensor system of film or filters or ... may react differently.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sfnEE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Modern white 'phosphor LEDs'typically use a short wavelength blue LED and a yellow phosphor. Some of the blue light is converted to yellow by ""exciting"" the phosphor so that it re-emits the energy as syellow light. The relative mix of blue and yellow and the exact emitted frequency ranges are varies to produc elight ranging from ""warm white"" (around 2500 - 3500 Kelvin effective colour temperature) up through daylight like whites in the 4000K - 7000k range and then to distnctly blue whites up to about 10,000 K equivalent. At or above about 10,000K the ""white light"" appears very blue. The yellow/blue mix is adjusted so that the vector sum lies on a spectrum line which true  black body radiator colours track along so that the light ""looks"" white, within limits.</p>

<p>eg When you have continuous spectrum light you can apply filtering at any wavelength to remove or alter part of the light to change the overall mix. When you have a few finite peaks you may not have any light at the frequency range of the filter that worked OK with natural light. The results MAY be very substantially different. </p>

<p>eg A photo sensor may react in a certain way to natural light with a wide range of frequencies present. Artificial lighgt with the same apparent colour temperature to the eye will present the sensor </p>

<p>eg If you have an eg Sodium Lamp as are found on some highways with a vey orange light, you have a few closely spaced orange emission lines and nothing else. No amount of filtering will 'correct' this to look like natural light. Whilke that is obviously ext=reme it is just an extreme case of what is happening with the limited wavelength  output sources sources mentioned above. <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/SOX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source CCA/SA</a></p>

"Why is the aperture ring removed from new Nikon lenses?","18748","","<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but I notice that Nikon's newer lenses don't have an aperture ring.

<p>I never used a D-type lens, but I believe that it is much easier to rotate the aperture ring on the lens than pressing a specific button then rotating the wheel on the DSLR body when you need to adjust the aperture (and it always annoyed me to do it this way, since I often change aperture and I can't do it while keeping the camera at my face with a finger on a shutter button).</p>

"How can I determine the minimum shutter speed to avoid blur from camera shake?","18710","","<p>How can I determine the minimum shutter speed at which I can effectively avoid camera shake while hand-holding the camera?</p>
","<p><strong>General Rule</strong></p>

<p>The general rule of thumb for 35mm (full frame) has been the reciprocal of the focal length.</p>

<p>This means that for a 50mm lens, the minimum shutter speed when hand-holding is 1/50 sec.</p>

<pre><code>1/(focal length) = 1/50
</code></pre>

<p>Since this is usually not an option, 1/60 sec is the next option.</p>

<p>Since the move to digital and multiple sensor sizes, the generally agreed upon rule is that the <em>effective focal length</em> is the number to keep in mind.</p>

<p>So, on a APS-C cropped sensor, a 50mm lens would need a <code>1/(50 * 1.6) = 1/80 sec</code>.</p>

<p>On a longer telephoto, say a 300mm on a full-frame (35mm) you would need 1/300 sec.</p>

<p><strong>Image stabilization</strong></p>

<p>Camera (and lens) makers are now adding image-stabilization to their lenses, which lowers the shutter speed needed. Generally the makers will rate the level of stabilization in stops. Keep in mind these ratings are used for marketing and may be a bit inflated, but I am going to do my calculations based on the numbers being correct to keep it simple.</p>

<p>If you are using a 100mm lens with a 2 stop image stabilization system on a APS-C cropped sensor then:</p>

<pre><code> (1/(effective focal length)) * (2 ^ image-stabilization-stops)

 (1/(100*1.6)) * (2^2)

 (1/160)*4 = 1/40 sec

<p>The principle is that of <em>oversampling</em>, also used in electronics for analog to digital conversion (what digital photography somehow) to obtain a higher bit resolution from a less accurate hardware using averaging over more samples.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do, is a night picture with a compact camera, so without manual control of shutter time, taking a long video and processing it, obtaining a — hopefully — decent photo, for resolution and noise.</p>

<p>Is this possible? Has anyone tried it?</p>

<p>An alternative could be to take several shots, which will likely have a too short shutter time and will be underexposed and noisy, and use them to make a decent picture. Would this work better?</p>
","<p><strong>Yes</strong> it is and there are several ways to do that.</p>

<p>The easiest which works with any camera (still or video) is to <strong>split the video file  into a sequence of stills</strong> using software like ffmpeg. Then pass the images to an <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/20901/what-software-exists-to-perform-exposure-fusion"">Exposure Fusion software</a>. While it was not it primary intention, Exposure Fusion works really well to blend images which results in lower noise, increased dynamic-range and greater depth-of-field (depending on the fusion weights).</p>

<p>Should you want more direct controls, it won't be hard to <strong>load all these images as layers</strong> in a software which supports this concept like Photoshop. Then all you need is to <strong>set the correct blending mode</strong>. I am guessing something like <em>Average</em> would do it.</p>

<p>As @Russell said, this can also be done from images using Multi-Frame noise-reduction. Sony is big on it and so is Fuji in their CMOS based cameras (F and HS series). They call it <em>Pro Low-Light</em> mode. @mattdm said Pentax does it too but from memory I do not remember which one.</p>

<p>I <em>suspect</em> but didn't try it that you would get very similar results using the Multi-Exposure mode present in most Pentax, Nikon, Olympus ILCs (plus the Canon 1D X and 5D Mark III). This is usually limited to 2-9 images. Note that you must enable <em>Auto Gain</em> on Nikon &amp; Olympus and <em>Auto EV Adjustment</em> on Pentax for this to blend rather than add exposures.</p>

<p>Should you want to do your own Multi-Frame noise-reduction you want to use a proper exposure, not under-exposed images. This is because noise is much higher in dark areas of images. Obviously, if the scene is too dark to be exposed properly then you have to work with what you can get. Adding multiple images to create a brighter one is called <a href=""http://www.shutterphoto.net/article/photo-stacking-and-long-exposures-part-1-introduction/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Image Stacking</a> and is used for Astrophotography.

<p>(I do not have a mac so Aperture is not an option)</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether somebody has been able to test them all (or most!) and provide a first-person feedback on which features stand up / are lacking in comparison, plus any additional experience advise in comparing these software. I do know that lightroom is great and that you don't get wrong with that ;-) , and that I could test drive all of them. My experience though is that it takes way more than 30 days to discover the real features AND limitations of this kind of software.</p>

<p>Price is of course an element of the comparison, but only at an equal feature point.</p>

<p>There is more than just the features; <strike>for instance I hear color management on Linux is hard - I don't want to launch an off-topic discussion about it, but if there's a very strong agreement on such a point it will be an issue against DarkTable</strike>(edit: i investigated and it's actually false).</p>

<p>I understand there might be some subjectiveness into this, please let me know with comments if there's any interest in making the answer a collaborative wiki.</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed: ASP way faster. LR - sloooow (on Core i5 3550, 16GB RAM, Win7)</li>
<li>Importing: ASP no need to import to do enough tasks with files. LR - mandatory</li>

<li>Layered editing: ASP only <strong>EDIT:</strong>(however you can have masks on each layer)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gradients: LR only</li>
<li>Straighten: ASP much better (in fact, LR doesn't have but one could fake it)</li>
<li>Noise Removal: ASP better (IMHO - it has several ways including Noise Ninja OOTB)</li>
<li>Plugins: ASP is better (you can have plugins for the entire image processing pipeline)</li>
<li>Lens Correction: LR has slightly more lenses</li>
<li>Real Multi monitor support: LR only</li>

<li>Red eye removal: LR only</li>
<li>Print: Didn't use</li>
<li>Keywording: 

<ul>
<li>ASP has Shortcut assignment for keywords</li>
<li>LR gives you the last 9 keywords used and the entire keyword tree in place to pick from it.</li>
<li><strong>EDIT:</strong> Both give keyword sets for Outdoor/Wedding/Custom etc. However:

<ul>
<li>LR - only 9 keywords in a set</li>
<li>ASP - unlimited</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Batch) Export/Save As: 

<ul>
<li>ASP allows you to specify full custom processing settings to apply before saving as JPEG/TIFF</li>
<li>DNG: LR only</li>
<li>Watermarking: LR only</li>
<li>Speed: ASP better</li>
<li>Export to other targets (email etc.): LR only</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>...and many many more. :-)
Generally speaking, LR is more bloated, slow and more mature. Also, the LR's GUI is much more shiny (ornaments, more animations etc.). ASP (in fact Bibble 5 Pro rebranded) is a ""fresh"" newcomer which covers some areas in which LR has problems (speed, catalog management, layered editing come in mind).</p>

<p>The best thing for you is to download both trials (ASP is quite small) and see for yourself.</p>

<p>However, IMHO, if you can stick with ASP and covers you in anything what you want, then go with it. Otherwise LR. </p>

"How needed is the Image Stabilization on the Canon 70-200 f2.8 L USM lens?","18565","","<p>I just picked up photography a few months ago as a hobby (not planning to go professional at all), but will be getting good gear and glass over time. Right now I have a T3i, which I'm considering upgrading to a 7D or probably a used 5d Mk II next year.</p>

<p>For my next lens purchase, I'm considering a 70-200 L lens, I'm just not sure which one to go for.</p>

<p>I'm deciding between the 70-200 2.8 L with no IS, or the 70-200 f4 L with IS.</p>

<p>My thinking is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While I do not plan to photograph weddings or anything like that, I do plan to use the lens to take pictures of my kid on school plays over the years, so I'm guessing the 2.8 would be useful there? He's not on school yet, but I hear flash is not allowed there? How would the f4 fare in such situations?</p></li>
<li><p>I have the 18-135 kit lens with IS...I turned off the Image Stabilization on the lens, and was able to take decent pictures handheld with not-so-fast shutter speeds (1/15, 1/20's), although I do NOT have a good pulse. Would being able to do this translate well to using the 2.8 with no IS?</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the shooting with the 70-200 will probably be done outside..just that case of shooting plays or a concert or too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So..what should I do? Anything I'm not considering?</p>
","<p>according to your needs the f/4 should suit just fine, but since they are basically the same price <em>I</em> would go for the f/2.8... i have it and its an awesome lens.</p>

"Color film comparison: How does Fujifilm Superia compare to Kodak Portra?","18480","","<p>I am a newbie to color analog photography. So far I have only use B&amp;W films. Specifically, I prefer Ilford Delta 400, Kodak Tri-X and Ilford 3200. My camera is Pentax ME Super. I am on the big step to move to color photography using film.</p>

<p>I have found in the store in my neighborhood two types of films, Fuji Superia and Kodak Portra. Since I am keen to try several films, I wonder what are the differences between those two. What should I expect to see from each of those? What about the noise of each? What are the differences in color temperature? What other color film alternatives are there? </p>
","<p>Portra is a low-contrast, low-saturation film made primarily for wedding and portrait photographers (it's the successor to Vericolor III Professional). It's designed to capture the details in both the white wedding dress and the black tuxedo at the same time, while rendering pleasing, blemish-minimized skin tones. There's nothing special about its grain structure or resolution; it's about par for the course in last-generation colour films. As with most colour negative film, you can increase the saturation and contrast by slightly overexposing (shooting the 160, for instance, as if it were ISO 100) without any special development (as long as you don't go over by more than 2/3 of a stop), but that just gets you into the same sort of range as general-purpose consumer films. Pushing it (underexposing by 1 or 2 stops, then having the film developed to compensate) will result in a grainy pastel-coloured image. This film would definitely not be your first choice for shooting autumn foliage, but if you want to flatter people or create something just a little bit on the sentimental side, it's a great choice.</p>

<p>Superia is a general-purpose film designed to be a bit ""snappy"". The colours aren't super-saturated, but they're definitely <em>there</em> in an unmistakable way, and there's a lot more contrast in the midtones. (You can bring the saturation and contrast down a touch by very slightly underexposing; again by no more than 2/3 of a stop, and you'll suffer a slight grain penalty doing so.) You'll want to be a lot more careful shooting people; if you want a polished, commercial look for fashion-type shots, then good makeup isn't optional. As with most films designed for slightly higher contrast and saturation, the grain is a little bit smaller and ""tighter"". If you want ""candy colours"" in a fashion shoot or are shooting things other than people, this is probably the film you want (if Portra is the alternative).</p>

"What does the AE/AF lock button do that half-pressing the shutter doesn't?","18457","","<p>The Sony A6000 has an AEL button, while Nikon SLRs have an AE/AF lock button. What do these do that half-pressing the shutter to lock focus and exposure, and then recomposing, doesn't? I'm used to the latter method, and never used a camera that has a dedicated button.</p>

<p>I read that you have to keep both the AE/AF lock button pressed and the shutter half-pressed while recomposing. Isn't this harder than just keeping the shutter button half-pressed?</p>

<p>I'm aware that you can customize the AE/AF lock button to lock only focus, or only exposure, or both. This leads to two follow-up questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can't you customize the half-press shutter to lock only AE or only AF?</li>
<li>If you don't care about this level of customization, does the AE / AF lock button do anything that half-pressing the shutter doesn't? </li>
</ol>
","<p>Most advanced cameras allow you to separate exposure and/or focus lock from a half press of the shutter button to allow each photographer to choose how and when focus and exposure are locked for a given composition. <em>Even what happens by default in the camera's ""factory"" settings will often vary based on what shooting modes in terms of exposure and focus are selected.</em></p>

<p>Why is it advantageous to separate exposure lock and focus lock from the shutter button? If both focus and exposure are locked by a shutter half press, then pressing an AEL or AF-L/AF-On button allows you to update either exposure or focus without changing the other value. They also allow you to maintain the same exposure or focus settings for more than one frame.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Suppose you want to take a series of shots, such as a panorama, with different composition but the same exposure settings.</strong> Press the button on your camera that locks exposure and focus and hold it down while you take the series. I saves you the trouble of metering and then switching to <strong>M</strong> exposure mode to preserve the exposure settings for more than one shot.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you are using a form of continuous focus and find the need to lock focus.</strong> With most advanced cameras there are several ways to do this. You can usually set the camera to either allow a half press to start focus (camera will focus continuously without locking as long as the shutter is half pressed) and a press and hold of the AF-L or AF-On will lock the focus OR you can set the camera so that a half press does not start focus and pressing the AF-L/AF-On button is required to focus. In the second case you would focus by pressing the AF-L/AF-On button. As long as the button is pressed the camera would continuously focus and if you wanted to lock the focus at a particular point you simply release the AF-L/AF-On button.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can hold down the AF-L/AF-On button to take multiple shots at the same focus setting.</strong> Just as with exposure, there are times you may want to maintain the same focus distance for a series of shots. Holding down the AF-L/AF-On button allows you to do this if you are using an AF-S/One Shot focus mode. Otherwise your camera would refocus between shots. Another advantage of this method is that it may increase your burst rate because the camera isn't refocusing between each frame.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you are using a form of ""One Shot"" or AF-S focus.</strong> In this scenario if the shutter half press tells the camera to find focus and then lock it as well as begin metering, you can set the AF-L/AF-On button to refocus after you have recomposed. By continuing to hold down the shutter at half press the exposure settings will remain locked while you refocus.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you are shooting in a mode that locks focus and exposure at the shutter half press, pressing the AE-L button will allow you to update the metering without altering the focus.</strong> This is useful for focus and recompose or when the lighting conditions of a scene may be changing rapidly. The AE lock button allows you to update the metering without changing the focus.</p></li>

"Why is Aperture changing the color of my RAW photos?","18456","","<p>For some strange reason, Aperture 3 seems to shift the colors of the raw images, after importing them.</p>

<p>For example, the reds become washed out and something not red. In the following example, the red of the sweater was pure red!</p>

<p>When viewed on Adobe Camera Raw, I get the correct color (the same one when viewed in the camera):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kd18i.png"" alt=""Screenshot from Adobe Camera Raw""></p>

<p>but when is imported into Aperture and the initial processing completes, the colors are not correct.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf0tR.png"" alt=""Screenshot from Aperture""></p>

<p>The only setting that has being applied by default to the image, is the ""RAW Fine Tuning"" from which I've removed the ""Hue Boost"" and the ""De-Noise"" from the default setting, because I think its messing up the photos.</p>

<p>The settings are the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYMbI.png"" alt=""RAW Fine Tuning settings""></p>

<p>but I don't thing that these would make any change!</p>

<p>Does anyone knows how can I preserve the colors of the image?</p>
","<p>It's really fairly simple: there's a direct trade-off between color accuracy and apparent noise.</p>

<p>To sense color, the sensor has a filter in front of each sensel. As it happens, the filter for the red channel cuts out the most light. This means when you're doing the conversion, you have to multiply the red channel by the largest factor<sup>1</sup> to achieve a particular color balance. When you multiply the data, however, you're increasing the apparent noise right along with the intended data.</p>

<p>As such, to minimize apparent noise, the raw converter software wants to use the weakest multiplier on the red channel that it can get away with.</p>

<p>It looks to me like Aperture is simply using a somewhat smaller multiplier on the red channel to reduce the appearance of noise. ACR apparently uses a slightly larger multiplier to give more accurate reds. Though it appears unlikely to matter much in this particular picture, it's probably fair to guess that when you have pictures taken in relatively low light that Aperture will do a slightly better job of suppressing noise without losing detail.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> In case you care about the details, the green channel is normally the ""baseline"" so we'll treat its factor as 1.0. The blue channel is multiplied by a factor of around 1.3 to 1.4, and the red by a factor of about 2 to 2.3. This varies with the camera though -- Sony, for one example, uses much stronger red filters than Canon, so their cameras reproduce saturated reds more easily, but also do relatively poorly in noise tests.</p>

"Is there an ""Exposure"" setting In GIMP comparable to that in Photoshop's Image Adjustments?","18394","","<p>In Photoshop, there is an Exposure feature in Image-Adjustments-Exposure which changes the image as if you actually changed the shutter speed on the camera. This effect is generally much more effective than using the Brightness or Contrast features.</p>

<p>So is there a similar feature in GIMP or through a free GIMP plugin? If there isn't, are there any external programs (must be free and preferably portable on a USB) that can emulate this effect?</p>
","<p>Gimp doesn't have an Exposure setting like that, which is kind of a lacking point, but on the other hand easily worked-around by using the curves tool instead. It appears that recently, the trend in Gimp has been to focus the software as more a graphics design and image manipulation tool rather than photo post-processing software. That's a bit too bad for us photographers, but the fact is that such adjustments are really better done <em>earlier</em> in the workflow, ideally by getting the exposure right initially — or, failing that, in RAW development.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can see what the Gimp ""Brightness"" adjustment is doing by using the Brightness/Contrast control and setting the value to +100 brightness, then hitting ""Edit as Levels"" and in <em>that</em> tool hitting ""Edit as Curves"". You'll get a Curves dialog similar to this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7MXzk.png"" alt=""brightness +100 as curves""></p>

<p>The gray line from corner to corner is the existing file, and the black line is the new mapping.</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, exactly the opposite of what you want to do to emulate the (non-motion related, of course — we'll take a static scene as a given!) effect of a longer exposure. What you want, instead, is a mapping like this, which is effectively multiplying the brightness of each part of the image by a constant factor:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D59HP.png"" alt=""Added exposure as curve""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this interface doesn't give you anything to easily see numerically the amount of increase (let alone in a photography-related idiom like ""stops"" measured in EV). <em>But</em>, really, what you probably want is something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WpyAy.png"" alt=""curvier curve""></p>

<p>which brings up the shadows a little bit, the midtones even more, and then has a rolloff preserving the highlights instead of clipping them.</p>

<p>Or, you may want this modification of the classic <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/21376/what-is-a-slanted-s-in-a-curves-layer"">contrast-enhancing ""S"" curve</a>, which is shifted a bit to add contrast while also pulling up the midtones:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7CT0.png"" alt=""contrast enhancement with increased midtimes""></p>

<p>Try these on your own image with ""preview"" enabled and see what they do. It's unfortunate that there's no easy, EV-based dialog, but overall, the enhanced flexibility is arguably better anyway (in Photoshop too!).</p>

<p>Or (especially when exposure is way off), use Darktable or Rawtherapee or (distant third in the UI department but technically fine) Ufraw before importanting to Gimp.</p>

"Why and how do ""bigger pixels"" make a better picture?","18331","","<p>This is going off of today's iPhone 5S announcement, when Phil Schiller said that ""bigger pixels"" is the key to a better picture.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XKqoz.jpg"" alt=""apple says bigger is better"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0441.png"" alt=""other parts are larger too""></p>

<ol>
<li>What does this mean?</li>
<li>Is it true or just a marketing ploy?</li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>Quick summary</strong></p>

<p>Yes, bigger pixels do improve performance all else being equal, and Apple is doing a good thing by focusing on sensor size. However in this case the increase in size is so slight that the difference will be negligible, probably not living up to the level of improvement you may expect from their marketing.</p>

<p><strong>What does bigger pixels mean?</strong></p>

<p>This is referring to the size of the photodetectors, which represent the pixels, on the camera's sensor.</p>

<p>In short, the more light reaching these photodetectors, the more accurately they can measure light levels, thus reducing noise.  To simplify things, noise is usually a factor in low-light or indoor photography.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get bigger photodetectors on a sensor:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have fewer pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the sensor larger.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The former is a trade-off against resolution, which may or may not result in a net improvement, whereas the latter is an overall gain.  In the iPhone 5S, they've gone with the latter, which is good.</p>

<p>Small sensors such as those in cellphones and compact cameras suffer the most from having small pixels, because for the same number of pixels, their pixels have to be much, much smaller than those in DSLRs and other professional/prosumer cameras.</p>

<p><strong>The megapixel race</strong></p>

<p>The desire to cram more and more pixels into camera sensors has diminishing returns in resolution, and has begun to harm - or has neglected to improve - the <em>sensitivity</em> of the small sensors in cellphones and compact cameras.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was driven by the mentality that ""more pixels = better camera"", as megapixel count is very <em>easy</em> to market your camera by.  In reality, diminishing returns ensure that the more pixels you add, the less important it is to add more, and we're getting to the point where a lot of sensors, particularly the tiny ones inside cellphones, can't even resolve enough resolution to justify the megapixel counts anyway, due to the properties of the lens used and the sharpest image they can produce on the sensor.</p>

<p>Advancements in sensor technology such as microlenses and back illumination, along with more advanced noise reduction algorithms, have gone some way toward making up for the lost sensitivity due to increased pixel counts in such a small sensor, but not far enough: today's cellphone cameras are still noisy indoors and in low light due to their small light-gathering area.</p>

<p>It is very <em>difficult</em> to market your camera based on sensitivity or other aspects of image quality, when megapixel count remains the primary marketing statistic associated with digital cameras, however misleading.</p>

<p><strong>So why is Apple marketing it this way?</strong></p>

<p>The uninformed public still expects that if a camera improves, its megapixel count rises.</p>

<p>Apple, however, is releasing a ""better"" camera in their cellphone, but with no rise in megapixel count.</p>

<p>Technically, this is a <em>good</em> idea for image quality.  However, it's difficult to explain to people why this is, when they've been conditioned to believe that megapixel count is the primary metric for image quality.</p>

<p>Marketing the iPhone 5S camera in this way is an attempt to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Shift the marketing of camera sensors away from pixel count and towards sensitivity and other aspects of quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Distract from the fact that megapixel count, which many people still assume determines image quality, has not risen.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately they are not the first to attempt this same revolution and won't be the last.  The megapixel myth is very firmly entrenched.</p>

<p><em>Note: in response to some comments below, I define the ""megapixel myth"" as the myth that pixel count is the primary factor determining image quality and that more pixels is always better quality - not that pixel count doesn't have any benefit. Also inherent to the problem of the megapixel myth is that it distracts from important statistics such as sensor size, which is virtually never even talked about for cellphones and compact cameras.</em></p>

<p><strong>Is it true or is it a marketing ploy?</strong></p>

<p>It is <em>technically</em> true, but in this case the difference is so small as to be insignificant.</p>

<p>It is true that keeping the same number of pixels and making each pixel bigger results in better sensitivity, and that's what they've done here.  This should result in lower noise (or, if the camera can use faster speeds as a result, possibly less motion blur in low light).  Their actual claim that ""bigger pixels = better picture"" is a simplification of this and could potentially confuse people into thinking their outdoor daylight pictures might also be improved, which is not the case.  But in low light scenarios the improved sensitivity will provide a benefit.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, they haven't made them very much bigger.  With <em>only</em> a 6.6% increase in sensor size, any resulting gain in sensitivity is going to be tiny: so small that it insignificant.  To put it into perspective, a DSLR has a sensor that is approximately 500-900% as big as a compact camera.  <em>That</em> would result in a significant sensitivity gain of multiple f-stops.  A 6.6% increase is very insignificant.  It represents about one sixth of one f-stop.</p>

<p>So it's kind of a marketing ploy as well.  To make any significant gains they would have to increase sensor size a lot more.  It's also a marketing ploy because previously their marketing did focus on megapixel count, and yet they've now switched the way they market <em>because</em> they have opted not to increase the megapixel count and still want to be able to boast that they have improved the camera.</p>

"Longer exposure & lower ISO or shorter exposure & higher ISO - what gives better results when photographing stars?","18315","","<p>I've been dabbling with night landscapes and star photography with varying levels of success. I know I don't have the ideal lens (Canon 17-40mm f4 on a Canon 6D body) but I've seen some great shots done with the same gear. 
I also have a Canon 50mm f1.4 which is great but it's just not wide enough. </p>

<p>I usually shoot at f4, ISO 800-1600, Long Exposure Noise reduction on, 30 - 40 seconds. I find the <strong>results very noisy and the stars not bright enough</strong>.  at 30 seconds stars are not bright enough and at 40 seconds they are already trailing.  <a href=""http://500px.com/photo/37081694"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is one of my attempts.</a></p>

<p>I recently saw some photos (examples <a href=""http://500px.com/photo/37950422"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://500px.com/photo/37835700"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) that are captured at shorter exposure times but much higher ISO (5000-6400)</p>

<p>I am thinking perhaps when I am close to 40 seconds the sensor is heating up more which is causing more noise?  Specifically for photography stars, is shorter exposure time and higher ISO a better formula?</p>
","<p>Noise is a fact of life when it comes to astrophotography, with the exception being stacked deep sky photos taken on a tracking mount (more in a moment). </p>

<p>Your photo is actually very low noise, in the grand scheme of wide field, single-frame astrophotography shots that I have seen...but it also lacks saturation. I think it really comes down to a matter of taste, but ultimately, one way or the other, you will get roughly the same amount of noise in your photographs regardless of the ISO setting. If you wish to achieve the same amount of saturation, you have to do one of two things. You are either going to need to use a higher ISO setting (ISO 3200, maybe even as high as 6400), or you are going to have to boost exposure in post. The vast majority of noise in astrophotography is from photon shot noise, so using a higher ISO is the same as a post-process exposure boost from a noise standpoint.</p>

<p>In your example photo, you have a wide-field, single-frame shot. Your limited to a single frame because of the foreground, unless you resort to more complex trickery where you take multiple frames, cut out the sky, and stack those frames to improve the saturation of the sky. Certainly possible...also a lot of work. Like you, I like astrophotography shots that include some of the landscape in the foreground, so it's worth trying some manual partial stacking to improve your SNR.</p>

<p>Heat is certainly a contributor to noise during long exposures. I am not sure that 40 seconds is long enough to produce so much heat that thermal noise becomes a more significant factor than photon shot noise. Older DSLRs used to have thermal bubbles due to overheating of near off-die components...when taking dark frames, you could clearly see regions at the corners or along edges of the frame that had more noise. I've never seen such an occurrence with my 7D, and there are times when I have taken 40-50 second long exposures at 16mm.</p>

<p>There are ways to reduce the various non-photon sources of noise. Dark frames and Bias frames are two. The use of dark and bias frames is usually only really necessary when doing multiple exposure stacking with a tool like <a href=""http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deep Sky Stacker</a>. Generally speaking, ""Long Exposure Noise Reduction"" in-camera is really just taking a dark frame that is natively subtracted from the light frame before it is saved to the memory card. A single dark frame will help mitigate some read noise, but not as much as a properly stacked multi-exposure dark frame as explained on <a href=""http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSS's site here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>It should be noted that the most important thing in astrophotography is SNR, or signal-to-noise ratio. The higher your per-frame SNR, the better the results...stacked or otherwise. You could take 120 5-second frames, or 5 120-second frames...the five 120 second frames are always going to produce better results. You could even take 500 5-second frames, and the 5 120-second frames are still going to produce a richer result, since the per-frame SNR is much higher. Each frame contains richer, more complete information that you are unlikely to ever fully replicate by stacking much shorter exposures. </p>

<p>The next best way to improve SNR is to move to a camera with bigger pixels. Per-pixel SNR is higher with larger pixels, so on a per-pixel basis, your results should be better, and at higher ISO settings, than with a camera that has smaller pixels. If we were to compare the 1D X and the 7D (both 18mp sensors), the 1D X's larger pixels will each gather 2.6x more light. You are already using the 6D, which is a very good camera for astrophotography thanks to it's large pixels and great high ISO performance. From a pure SNR standpoint (based on sensorgen.info data), the 1D X at ISO 3200 supports ~3x the saturation per pixel, the 6D at ISO 3200 supports ~2x the saturation per pixel, as any one of Canon's 18mp APS-C sensors. The 6D also has the highest quantum efficiency (photon to electron conversion rate) of all Canon DSLRs (as of 2013 - later models have bested it), which means more SNR ""bang for the buck"".</p>

<p>Since you are already using the best camera you can probably get from Canon for astrophotography purposes, the only other thing you can really do is crank the ISO up. At lower ISO settings, more read noise is present. Particularly with Canon, the more you crank up the ISO, the lower the read noise contribution, to the point where at the highest ISO settings, read noise may be as little as 1.3e- per pixel (well below the flat minimum of ~3e- for the Sony Exmor found in the D800.) </p>

<hr>

<p>Therefor, since boosting exposure post-process is the same as boosting ISO when read noise is so low, to improve the saturation of the sky and brightness of the stars, use a higher ISO setting. You said you use ISO 800-1600. Try ISO 3200, 6400...maybe even 8000. The general idea is to reduce your white point such that the camera uses it's electronics to boost the signal as much as possible before read, to minimize the impact of read noise. It should be noted that boosting exposure of an ISO 800 shot in post such that it resembles an exposure of ISO 6400 would likely result in MORE noise, as read noise at ISO 800 is more than twice as much at the lower ISO setting (5.1e- vs. 2.0e- according to sensorgen.info.) </p>

<hr>

<p>To make things a little clearer, I've diagrammed a hypothetical astrophotography scenario. This scenario assumes a 30 second exposure at f/4, performed once for each ISO setting from 100 through 12800, using a Canon 5D III. The assumption is that a 30s f/4 exposure at ISO 12800 results in the brightest pixels (stars) reaching the ""saturation point"" (in other words, the brightest stars come out pure white, as any red, green, and blue pixels for those stars reach the maximum charge level). The exact same exposure at all other ISO settings will result in an exposure below the saturation point. Additionally, the difference between read noise and photon shot noise is demonstrated. </p>

<p>In the diagram below, the linear X axis represents each ISO setting, and the logarithmic Y axis represents charge level in electrons (e-). Red and green lines are drawn for each ISO setting, with <strong>red</strong> representing <strong>read noise</strong>, and <strong>green</strong> representing <strong>saturation point</strong>. The dynamic range is effectively the ratio between saturation point and read noise (green over red). For ISO 100, the saturation point is also the literal maximum photodiode charge level (FWC, or full well capacity). The blue bars represent the signal, and the darker part of the blue bar represents the intrinsic noise in that signal (photon shot noise, which is the square root of the signal.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hanZd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Assuming a 30s f/4 exposure that reaches maximum saturation at ISO 12800, the <em>charge of that signal</em> is 520e- (according to sensorgen.info). Therefor, assuming the exact same exposure is used for all other ISO settings...the signal, as well as the photon noise, will be <strong>IDENTICAL</strong>. <em>(Charge in the photodiode is a product of light over time...which is affected by ONLY aperture and shutter speed.)</em> What changes as we reduce ISO is that read noise begins to rise. Since the scale is logarithmic, ISO settings 800 through 12800 have little difference in read noise (particularly 1600 through 12800). Once we reach ISO 400, read noise starts to rise to the point where it is a greater ratio of the overall signal than photon noise.</p>

<p>The key difference between shooting at ISO 12800, and shooting at ISO 400, is the saturation point (green bars). At ISO 12800, read noise is low, and the signal saturates, so you'll have a bright, colorful image strait out of camera. At ISO 400, the signal is a small fraction (520e-) of the saturation point (18273e-), and will this require a significant boost to exposure in post to look the same as the ISO 12800 shot. If one does shoot at ISO 400 and correct exposure in post, then overall noise constitutes a significant factor of the signal. The read noise floor, below which useful information effectively does not exist, is almost as high as photon shot noise. Such a post-process exposure boost would result in a high degree of banding and color noise, likely right up through the midtones. </p>

<p>For an extreme example, if one were to shoot at ISO 100, read noise becomes the primary contributor of noise (in this particular example...keep in mind, at ISO 100, the image is severely underexposed relative to the saturation point.) Boosting an ISO 100 exposure in this case (which, in order to simulate what the ISO 12800 shot produced, would have to be a <strong>SIX STOP BOOST</strong>) would result in significant banding and color noise. The following diagram demonstrates how noise, both read and photon shot, are amplified by correcting exposure in post for ISO 100 - 6400, in order to match the ISO 12800 exposure:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8pZXC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Remember that the scale here is logarithmic, so the amount of noise for each successively lower ISO setting is exponentially higher after exposure correction in post. </p>

<li>Make sure your camera locks exposure when you half-press the shutter release.</li>
<li>Set autofocus to continuous servo.</li>
<li>Your AE/AF lock button should be set to AF-lock only.</li>

<li>Place your meter point where you want to meter. Hold the shutter release halfway down.</li>
<li>Place your autofocus point over your subject.</li>
<li>Wait until autofocus locks on.</li>
<li>Press and hold the AF-lock button.</li>
<li>Recompose</li>
<li>Fully depress the shutter release.</li>

Camera settings:

<ul>
<li>AE/AF lock button should be set to AE-lock only.</li>
<li>Set autofocus to single focus (<em>One Shot</em> in Canon nomenclature).</li>
</ul>

When shooting:

<ol>
<li>Place your meter point where you want to meter.</li>
<li>Press and hold the AE-lock button. (On my camera, this will start up the meter if it has turned off after a delay)</li>
<li>Place your AF point over your subject.</li>
<li>Half-press and hold the shutter release.</li>
<li>Recompose</li>
<li>Shoot.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Focus, Meter, Recompose, Shoot</h2>

<h3>Method one: AF-On, meter on half-press.</h3>

Camera settings:

<ul>
<li>AE/AF lock button should be set to AF-On (Or whatever Canon calls this. Basically, autofocus only happens when you're holding this button.)</li>
<li>Make sure your camera locks exposure when you half-press the shutter release.</li>
<li><p>Set autofocus to single focus (<em>One Shot</em> in Canon nomenclature).</p>

When shooting:

<ol>
<li>Put your focus point over your subject.</li>
<li>Press the AF-On button until AF locks, and continue to hold the button. (You might be able to let go of the AF-On button if your camera can be to shutter priority, as opposed to focus priority.)</li>
<li>Put your meter point over where you want to meter.</li>
<li>Half-press and hold the shutter release.</li>
<li>Recompose</li>
<li>Shoot.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

Camera settings:

<ul>
<li>AE/AF lock button should be set to AE-lock only.</li>
<li>Set autofocus to single focus (<em>One Shot</em> in Canon nomenclature).</li>
<li>Make sure your camera does <strong>not</strong> lock exposure when you half-press the shutter release.</li>

It defaults to off, but after turning in it on, I can't find any actual controls to manually adjust exposure parameters. I doubt my phone's camera module actually has a physically variable aperture, but I expected to see some way to adjust shutter speed and ISO — or at least to set an exposure value. But I don't see anything. How do I use this new feature? </p>
","<p>Sadly, the feature's name is misleading. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it's <em>wrong</em>, if not an outright lie. <strong>Turning this option on just enables you to use <em>exposure compensation</em> — it doesn't let you do anything actually ""manual"".</strong></p>

<p>If you enable this option, the <code>...</code> menu at the lower right of the screen gains a <code>+/-</code> icon, as typically indicates exposure value compensation. Selecting this allows you to choose compensation on a scale from -2 to +2. Exposure is still entirely automatic, and even with a value selected here will change automatically as lighting in the frame changes. <strong>You can't use this to get a constant exposure from shot to shot, or set based on external metering, or anything else you would want to use actual manual exposure for.</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand why this is mislabeled, and I also don't understand why EV compensation isn't available by default. I guess it protects against newbies ruining their images by leaving it on accidentally, but there is an obvious indicator when a compensation value is selected, and EV compensation (with the same icon!) is common on pretty much all cameras at all price ranges. So, it's a mystery. And also something I'm reporting as a bug. </p>

<p>Note that the above applies to the Android 4.4 ""Kit Kat"" camera and to that app in 5.0 Lollipop. Lollipop <em>does</em> provide APIs allowing apps to have greater manual control, but the built-in camera doesn't take advantage of that, even with this option enabled.</p>

"Are there reasons to use colour filters with digital cameras?","18216","","<p>Digital photos can have colour filters applied after the fact by software, so are there any good reasons to use colour filters with a digital camera? As I understand it, the main reason for them originally was for effects with black and white film, but now even black and white is a post-processing effect.</p>

<p>I know that UV filters are good for lens protection, and that ND filters allow you to use longer exposures, but what use are colour filters?</p>
","<p>There's a difference between <strong>color</strong> and <strong>color correction</strong> filters although they both are colored. </p>

<p><strong>Color correction filters are useful</strong> in digital photography to get more <strong>even exposure in all channels</strong> under some special types of lightning.</p>

<p>For example you'd probably get more exposure and thus less noise in blue channel if you used blue color correction filter (82A/B/C) under tungsten lightning. It should be noted that these filters have <strong>filter factor</strong>, meaning one stop gain in noise could mean lost stop in terms of exposure time.</p>

<p>Underwater photography is another domain where light is tricky and physical filters are suggested, mostly warming, but <a href=""http://wetpixel.com/i.php/full/filters-and-ambient-light-photography/"" rel=""noreferrer"">fluorescent-correction filters may also apply</a>.</p>

<p>In this example two pictures were made in the same conditions under tungsten lightning (street light in winter), the first one shows blue channel from picture without any filtration and the second one blue channel from picture with fairly weak 80D filter. Note the differences in noise. It's important to mention that the white balance reference for both shots was taken from gray card and the blue channel shows more noise in unfiltered case because the blue channel got more amplified in that case.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8LIQT.jpg"" alt=""Blue filter""></p>

<p>The usual <strong>color filters for BW film are not very useful in digital world</strong> as these can easily result overexposure in one channel and leave the other channels underexposed and noisy. Putting a strong color filter in front of your lens means that you are using your digital camera inefficiently, as for example in case of red/blue filter, you're using just 25% of your available pixels and 50% in case of green.</p>

"What is the depth-of-field preview button on my DSLR supposed to show me?","18108","","<p>I'm fairly new to DSLRs and I've been exploring the functions on my new Canon 60D.</p>

<p>There's a button to the side of the lens described as the ""depth-of-field preview button"".  Based on the limited description in the manual, I thought this would give me a preview of how the photo would look in terms of what's in and out of focus when I'm using Live View.  </p>

<p>When I press it though, despite jerking as if it's processing something, I see no difference in the LCD screen.  I've played with the aperture with no discernible effect.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?  What should I be seeing?</p>
","<p>DoF preview is difficult to use well. The idea is simple, but application much less so. Without DoF preview, what you see through the viewfinder is shown with the lens ""wide open"" -- at its largest possible aperture. This provides no guidance about how much depth of field your picture will have, because (unless you happen to be shooting at maximum aperture) the picture you're seeing in the viewfinder won't be at the same aperture as the picture you take.</p>

<p>In theory, DoF preview is a simple answer to that: it just closes the aperture on the lens to whatever aperture you have set for the picture. If, for example, you were going to take a picture at f/11 using an f/2.8 lens, the DoF preview will stop the lens down from f/2.8 to f/11.</p>

<p>Difficulty in application stems from two facts. First of all, stopping the lens down significantly makes the view through the viewfinder darker. Second, and more importantly, the focus screen on most current cameras doesn't portray depth of field very accurately. A focus screen that transmits more light directly through gives a brighter view. Since most people depend on autofocus for focusing and don't worry much about DoF, this is the sort of screen used in most current cameras. A screen can be built to diffuse the light more. This doesn't give as bright of a view, but also makes the apparent sharpness in the viewfinder drop off much more quickly when things are out of focus. This makes the DoF preview in most cameras pretty inaccurate. What you see in the viewfinder will show a lot more DoF than the real picture regardless of the exact aperture the lens is set to.</p>

<p>As such, to use DoF preview at all well, you just about have to do some testing to compare what you see in the viewfinder to what you get in the picture. The two <em>won't</em> be the same (usually, anyway), and it's up to you to train your eye to compensate for the different between what you see and what you'll get to be able to compensate.</p>

<p>One technique I've used with reasonable success is to take some pictures at a particular aperture (e.g., f/8) and set up a laptop screen next to the camera so you can quickly look from the viewfinder to a picture you just took. You can then adjust the aperture (with DoF preview) to get <em>close</em> to the same DoF through the viewfinder as shows in the picture. What you really care about is how much difference you see between the two. Let's say the viewfinder at f/3.5 shows roughly the same DoF as the picture on the laptop that you took at f/8. That gives a difference of roughly 2.5 stops. From then on, you can use DoF preview to adjust the zone of sharpness as you see fit, and know that you'll need to open the aperture ~2.5 stops from there to get about the same DoF when you take a picture.</p>

Ideally it would be affordable, secure, etc. I'm looking for both the container and the transportation method. The print is approx 23x40 inches. Thanks!</p>
","<p>The most important rule of shipping things, especially large, heavy, expensive things, is:</p>

<p><strong>Expect your package to be dropped from a height of at least five feet at some point in its journey.</strong></p>

<p>I once saw a delivery guy drop a package containing a $30k camera from his chest height.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, protect your package.</p>

<ol>
<li>Non-framed prints should be in a mailing tube.  Put two mailing tubes if the print is valuable or you're paranoid.</li>
<li>Framed prints should be wrapped in bubble wrap at least three times around (sharp corners = broken bubble wrap, if you don't have cardboard covers for the frame)</li>
<li>Fill extra space with crinkled up paper.  </li>
<li>Make sure that there is at least an inch or two (preferably more) of space around the print itself, and that that space is filled with packing material.</li>
<li>Do not let things shake around inside the box.  Contents have a tendency to shift during flight, but things that are locked down won't move as much, and therefore have less chance to break.</li>
<li>If you're not confident in your packaging, insure it.</li>
<li>If you absolutely must have your package arrive safely, insure it.</li>
</ol>

<p>For that size print, I'd do these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wrap the (framed) print in a single piece of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher_paper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">butcher's paper</a>.</li>
<li>Wrap that package in several layers (four times around ought to do it) of bubble wrap.</li>
<li>Crinkle up some butcher's paper.  Put that into your cardboard box.</li>
<li>Place print into cardboard box.  If there is space on the sides, fill those spaces with more crinkled up butcher's paper.</li>
<li>Top off with butcher's paper.</li>
<li>Use packing tape to close the ends of the box.  Make sure that you use enough; a single piece of tape around the edge is not likely to do it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe it's overkill, but doing this has made most of my stuff arrive intact.</p>

"Is the lack of AF Motor on the Nikon D5100 an important factor?","18064","","<p>I had made up mind on purchasing a Nikon D5100 during the holidays but only yesterday I realized that it doesn't have a AF motor with it. </p>

<p>This is forcing me to change to Canon 550D which is in the same price range. I was more inclined to buy a Nikon so this is quite a change for me. The other cameras in the Nikon brand D90 and D7000 which have the AF Motor are not in my budget today. Also I notice that Canon 1100D which is less expensive yet has this motor in built into it. Why is Nikon giving this feature in expensive cameras only?</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that Af-S lenses are more expensive, is there any other drawback of buying a camera that doesn't have a AF Motor in it? As a beginner how does not having an AF motor affect the quality of pics?</p>

<p>Also, do mirrorless cameras have a built-in AF Motor ? </p>
","<p>You have things reversed!</p>

<p>Nikon traditionally always put their motors in the bodies, offering supplementary lens mounted motors for additional performance on some high end tele lenses only.</p>

<p>To be able to compete with the very low end Canon bodies on price (which is the only thing most purchasers for that category consider when making a purchase) they decided a few years ago to introduce a few bodies without body mounted motors, and at the same time introduce a line of low end consumer grade lenses with lens mounted motors, primarily for use on those bodies (the D3000 and D5000 I believe were the first).</p>

<p>Canon has always (well, since the introduction of their EF lens mount back in (I believe) the late 1980s had all their motors in the lenses only, never in the body.</p>

<p>This of course increases the price of lenses, especially for people buying more than one lens, as now you have to buy a lens motor for every single lens (for that reason 3rd party lenses for Canon had often been slightly more expensive than the otherwise same lens for Nikon).</p>

<p>Both systems have their advantages. Having the motor in the body allows for simpler lenses, puts weight nearer the photographer, and reduces the system cost and weight for people having many lenses. Having the motors in the lens allows motors which are designed specifically for each lens, potentially allowing for lower power, cheaper, motors for smaller lenses (the motor in a Nikon D200 has to be able to power both a lightweight 50mm f/1.8 D and a very heavy 600mm f/2.8 D (which existed or was planned at the time, now the 600mm is only available as AF-S, with its own complementary motor).</p>

<p>The main thing you'll experience when buying a D5100 is that you won't have full choice of all F mount lenses, unless you are happy with manual focus on them. But probably, by the time that becomes a limitation, you'll be looking at buying a bigger body anyway, and no longer have that problem.</p>

"What's the difference between Canon EOS battery packs?","18013","","<p>My camera manual for EOS 50D says I can use either BP-511A, BP-511, BP-512 or BP-514. The camera came with a single BP-511A. Does anyone know what A stand for? How is BP-511A different from BP-511?</p>

<p>Also, I found an online shop that sells BP-511 replacements, and they state that it replaces BP-511, BP-512, BP-522 and BP-535. How does BP-522 and BP-535 come into the picture? These two are not mentioned in my manual.</p>

<p>Should I assume that pretty much any Canon EOS battery with the same size, voltage and shape is good with my camera? Are the Canon EOS battery packs compatible across all EOS models? I know that battery grips are different, but I don't know about the battery packs.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Here's a battery compatibility table I compiled based on the responses I got here and information from various web sources featuring the mid-range and advanced Canon EOS models.</p>

<pre><code>Battery  Delivered     Optional
D30      BP-511        BP-511A
D60      BP-511        BP-511A
10D      BP-511/BP-512 BP-511A
20D      BP-511A       BP-511, BP-512, BP-514AC
30D      BP-511A       BP-511, BP-512, BP-514
40D      BP-511A       BP-511, BP-512, BP-514
50D      BP-511A       BP-511, BP-512, BP-514
5D       BP-511A       BP-511, BP-512, BP-514
60D      LP-E6         n/a
7D       LP-E6         n/a
5D mk2   LP-E6         n/a
5D mk3   LP-E6         n/a
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is no optional battery pack for the LP-E6 at the moment. The BP-514AC is said to have an optional DC coupler. I'm not sure what that means. But I imagine you can attach something to it that will allow you to plug it directly into the electrical outlet to charge it. It is sort of a battery and a charger all in one. I think...</p>

<p>Here are the battery capacity specs for the above mentioned battery packs. These numbers apply to the original Canon battery packs. Replacements can have higher capacity.</p>

<pre><code>BP-511  1100 mAh 7.4 V
BP-511A 1390 mAh 7.4 V
BP-512  1100 mAh 7.4 V
BP-522  2200 mAh 7.4 V
BP-535  3500 mAh 7.4 V
</code></pre>

<p>So if you can use a BP-511 and you're going for the original (OEM) battery pack, go for the BP-511A which will give you the best battery life.</p>

<p>Give me some feedback if you find this helpful or if you see any errors.</p>
","<p>The OEM version of the Canon BP-511 is rated at 1100mAh capacity. The BP-511A is rated at 1390mAh. To the best of my knowledge Canon discontinued manufacture of the BP-511 after they updated it with the higher capacity BP-511A.</p>

<p>Third party vendors make BP-511 compatible batteries rated at up to 2200mAh. My experience with Sterling Tek BP-511A compatible batteries rated at 2200mAH was that they did indeed last longer than the OEM BP-511A supplied by Canon with the camera.</p>

<p>Some battery packs in Canon's system are interchangeable with other battery packs, but most are not. The BP-522 and BP-535, for instance, are much larger than the BP-511 and would not fit in most applications designed to use the BP-511. The BP-511 series, however, might fit in devices that use the BP-522. The lower capacity of the BP-511A means that it would not last as long compared to the 3500mAH BP-535 in those devices.</p>

<p>The BP-512, which was supplied with the G2 and several Canon camcorder models appears to be functionally identical to the original BP-511 (but inside a slightly slimmer case) and is also rated at 1100mAh.
The BP-514 was supplied with the ZR80, ZR85, and ZR90 camcorders and appears to be the same size as the BP-512 and slightly thinner than the BP-511.</p>

<p>For the decision on whether to use OEM or generic batteries, see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1339/should-i-buy-an-original-manufacturer-battery-or-is-a-generic-brand-ok"">Should I buy an original manufacturer battery, or is a generic brand OK?</a>. <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/34791/15871"">My answer</a> is buried near the bottom as I didn't join this community until almost three years after the question was asked.</p>

<p>I've had good luck with Maximal Power and Sterling Tek batteries for my Canon cameras. Be aware that many sellers claiming to sell genuine OEM batteries are selling counterfeits, especially on eBay. Only buy OEM or generic batteries from a source you trust.</p>

"What's the difference between using a 50mm f/1.8G and a 50mm f/1.8D with a Nikon D80?","17995","","<p>Recently, Nikon announced their <a href=""http://blog.iamnikon.com/en_GB/product-news/get-creative-with-our-new-af-s-nikkor-50mm-f1-8g-lens/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">new 50mm f/1.8G lens</a>, as revamp of the old 50mm f/1.8D. <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/#!5796442/why-you-should-buy-nikons-new-18-nifty-fifty-lens"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's how Gizmodo describes the difference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main difference between this new
  ""nifty fifty"" and the almost
  decade-old ƒ1.8D is that it has an
  <strong>autofocus motor inside</strong>. This means you
  can use it with any current or recent
  Nikon SLR. The older lens lacks this
  motor and is instead driven by one in
  the camera, which cheaper bodies don't
  have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I currently use a Nikon D80 (and I don't plan on changing that any time soon), and I've been considering getting such a lens. <strong>Is there any difference between the D and the G lenses when used on a D80?</strong> I believe that the D one works just as well, since D80's have internal autofocus motors - is that right?</p>

<p>Besides the autofocus motor aspect, <strong>is there any other big difference</strong> between them? Since the D is priced at around $120 and the G at $220, should I just get the D?</p>
","<p>Well, the 50 f/1.8G hasn't really been released to 3rd parties yet, so it's difficult to say if any of these things are true for sure, but here's a few ways the AF-S version might be better than the AF-D version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Autofocus is quieter. This is fairly certain, as the AF-D version made some pretty audible focus noise, but AF-S lenses are all fairly quiet. </li>
<li>Autofocus is generally faster with AF-S, though the similar <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/2183/AF-S-DX-NIKKOR-35mm-f%252F1.8G.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">35mm f/1.8 DX AF-S</a> isn't known for lightning-fast autofocus.</li>
<li>Better image quality, maybe. Again, it's difficult to say at this point, because 3rd party sites like DxOMark and DPReview haven't gotten copies of the new lens yet. Certainly, Nikon is <em>trying</em> to improve image quality, which is why the new version has an aspherical element. The coatings are probably better, as well.</li>
<li>Autofocus override. You can adjust the focus after autofocus happens simply by turning the focus ring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different filter size. The AF-S version has 58mm filter threads, compared to 52mm for the older AF-D version.</li>
<li>Newer lens comes with a bayonet hood and a lens pouch.</li>
<li>The older, AF-D can go up to f/22, but the newer lens can only go to f/16.</li>
<li>The AF-S lens is an ounce heavier.</li>
<li>You can get the older lens today, but you'll have to wait for the AF-S.</li>

"How can I get a pure white background in studio photography?","17990","","<p>I am a natural light photographer that is venturing into studio/backdrop portraits at the request of some of my clients.</p>

<p>I have a portable studio for my needs with a white muslin backdrop.  </p>

<p>I am using one (maybe two) Speedlite 580 EX flashes with shoot through umbrellas as lighting.</p>

<p>In my practice shots, I cannot seem to get a nice ""blown out"" white background without dulling my subjects (decreased contrast/lighter exposure on their face and clothes).  </p>

<p>I am not a fan of seeing the muslin draped or crinkled in the background... although I know that's definitely a style... I will probably iron it but I can never get it perfectly flat and plus I need to transport it so it will get some wrinkles.</p>

<p>Also, what can I do to avoid any shadows against the backdrop itself (shadows created by the subject).  I do have them placed slightly away from the backdrop but kids sometimes move around.   Also if I am doing little children, I don't think having a small backlight would be practical (not that I have one... )</p>
","<p>To get the ""blown out"" white background you have to overexpose the background.</p>

<p>You have no choice, in order to over expose the background you need a very powerful light aimed at the background.</p>

<p>If you have two flashes place one of them behind or to the side of the subject aimed directly at the background behind the subject (unmodified, without an umbrella), you want to set the power to the minimum that will overexpose the area around the subject (any area not touching the subject can be easily made white in post).</p>

<p>Placing you subject as far as possible from the background helps because it minimizes the reflection from the background on the subject.</p>

<p>You then use the second flash as the key light and ambient light as fill (obviously that means you start by metering for the ambient and set your flashes power based on it). </p>

"What are the risks of using Magic Lantern?","17930","","<p>I am looking to use our Canon 550D (T2i) more for DSLR filming by using <a href=""http://magiclantern.wikia.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Magic Lantern</a>. However, I'm quite concerned about bricking the 550D, as it is the family camera and I'd be a ton of trouble if I messed it up. What are the risks involved with using Magic Lantern?<br>
(I know this is covered on <a href=""http://wiki.magiclantern.fm/faq"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Magic Lantern FAQs</a>, but I'd like to hear from people who have actually done this before, and not just from the developer)</p>

<p>Edit: For more clarification, I really want to know what can potentially happen and if something does happen to the camera, how hard is it to reverse the damage?</p>
","<p>The chances of bricking your camera are extremely low (but not zero).</p>

<p>I think something not everybody understands is the Magic Lantern does not install into your camera but to the SD card. My understanding is that the only change that is done to your camera is to enable the ""bootdisk"" flag, which is a very minor change. This flag tells the camera if it should try to load and execute software stored in the SD card.</p>

<p>Magic Lantern enables the bootdisk flag in your camera and then installs to the SD card. The bootdisk feature is what enables the camera to load Magic Lantern at boot time.</p>

<p>This is important to know, because if you replace the Magic Lantern SD card with a regular SD card (one that does not have Magic Lantern installed) or no SD card at all, the camera will not find any code to load, so it will just load the stock firmware, and there will be absolutely no trace of Magic Lantern. So you always have the choice to run Magic Lantern or not if you keep track of which of your SD cards have Magic Lantern installed and which do not.</p>

<p>My experience with Magic Lantern on my 60D has been very good, I think the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages and risks. Note that the software does crash from time to time, and sometimes it is necessary to remove the battery to reset the camera. I haven't experienced any crashes that didn't clear when removing the battery. The recent 2.3 release has been extremely stable in my experience.</p>

<p>If you want to minimize the risks I recommend the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow the installation instructions to the T. Read all the instructions and understand the entire process before you actually do it.</li>
<li>Only work with stable releases. At the time I'm writing this the stable release is 2.3.</li>
<li>Don't be an early adopter, wait a bit before you jump on to the new release. Let the more adventurous users (I'm one of them) try the new releases first.</li>
<li>Read the Magic Lantern forums to find out of potential problems other users are experiencing.</li>
<li>Always have an SD card w/o Magic Lantern installed at hand as a backup plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Important information for Eye-Fi card users:</p>

<ul>
<li>An Eye-Fi card cannot be used with Magic Lantern (this is documented)</li>
<li>An Eye-Fi card without Magic Lantern cannot be used as a backup card (this is not documented as far as I know). The camera will not boot and appears to be broken if you try.</li>
<li>In order to be able to use an Eye-Fi card again: Remove the bootdisk flag using Magic Lantern sw (i.e. full uninstall)</li>

"How will old M42 lenses work on a Nikon camera? ","17929","","<p>I wanted to get some cheap old lenses to use on my Nikon DX DSLR (D3100).</p>

<p>However, Nikon has one of the greatest flange distances of all manufacturers, which means that most lenses I can buy (M42 mount, etc) will not focus to infinity. I saw some adapters with correction lens to allow infinity focus, but also read they worsen picture quality.</p>

<p><strong>Has anyone here used this kind of setup?</strong><br>
(<strong>M42</strong> cheapo old lens + <strong>adapter to Nikon</strong> with/without infinity focus correction lens)</p>

<p>If so, what can I be expecting, quality-wise? I read M42 lenses are not that bad, and I only have DX lenses, so I would not be expecting heavenly performance.<br>
Basically, I'd like a nice big tele lens (300mm+) and the ability to focus it to infinity.</p>

<p>Example pictures would be awesome, and particularly I'd like to hear some interesting opinions <em>complemented</em> by example photos of the setup I'm talking about — a picture is worth a thousand words. </p>
","<p>The question asks for photo examples, and having recently gone through this exercise first-hand, I'll share my results.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href=""http://www.top35mm.com/helios-44-2-2-58mm-russian-lens-canon-eos-af"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Helios 44-2 58mm F/2.0</a> (M42 mount) on ebay for very cheap.

<p>Shooting with the infinity focus corrective lens, I was very disappointed with the quality. Unless you used a very small aperture, the shots were not usable at all. Even when stopped all the way down, it was still soft when pixel peeping. It also seemed  prone to a highlighted area in the center of the image. Here are a few test shots I took in the park:</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/CpbxN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://imgur.com/a/CpbxN</a></p>

<p>Sorry I don't have the exact settings used for each picture. It's a fully manual lens (including an aperture ring), so the aperture doesn't get recorded in the EXIF data of the photo.</p>

<p>Being disappointed with my initial results, I removed the infinity focus correction lens, and tried again. This time with spectacular results:</p>

<p>All shots in this set (except for the first one), are taken with the Helios 44-2 lens.</p>

<p>So what have I learned? The infinity focus corrective lens is a waste. The Fotodiox adapter still works great without it. The lens works great on a Nikon body as a macro lens. And since I can't focus on anything more than a few feet away, that's all it can be used for. Considering how little I paid for it, I think I'm ok with that :)</p>

"What flash options are there for the Pentax system?","17853","","<p>I am a relative newcomer to the photography world and am slowly building up a set of gear based around my Pentax K-x. Next on my list of priorities is a flash. As I have virtually no experience in this area, I am finding the array of choices and terminology to be a difficult (but intriguing) maze to navigate.</p>

<p>I have three primary questions, and beyond that any and all advice is welcome.</p>

<p><strong>1) Price -</strong>
A quick search on Amazon turns up Pentax-compatible flashes which range in price from about $50 to $500. What can one flash do that makes it worth $450 more, when on the surface they all appear to have similar features, i.e. swivel , zoom, etc.?  </p>

<p><strong>2) Brand -</strong>
I have seen mention of incompatible flash units doing damage to a camera they are mounted on. Is this an area where I should stick with an official offering and not go with a third party brand?</p>

<p><strong>3) Strobe Flash -</strong>
This is something I see talked about on photograph blogs, websites, magazines…, mostly in the context of Nikon and Canon. I have a basic idea of what a strobe flash (or speedlite) is, but what I don’t know is if they replace standard flashes, or are for special ‘advanced’ uses.
Also, I wonder if they are even available for a Pentax system?</p>
","<p>1) Power and features.  A flash with more power will, of course, allow you to bounce to higher ceilings, go through larger diffuse objects, and do daylight fill-flash at further distances.  </p>

<p>Quick feature discussion:   </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tilt:</strong> Most models have this, save the lowly AF-200FG.  </li>
<li><strong>Swivel:</strong> Most model shave this, except the AF-360FGZ for some reason.  Tilt/Swivel are not a problem if you get a flash bracket or sync cord.</li>
<li><strong>Autofocus assist:</strong> Many flashes emit a cross hatch pattern to help auto-focus in low light.  In general, this works much better than any AF-assist on a camera's body.  It is non-disorienting, does not mess with exposures, and can work (depending on the flashgun) in extremely dark situations.  Some even have an option to only AF-assist and not fire during an exposure, while some you can trick to do it (like the Sigmas).</li>
<li><strong>Manual:</strong> Some flashes only have a couple manual power settings which can be a pain.  Others have more steps and go to lower powers.  Quite for old lenses (particularly macros), and of course with off-camera flash.  In addition, some do not allow manual in certain modes (like Av, Tv, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Zoom:</strong> The flash can adjust how concentrated its light is.  Some flashes have less or more range, and some are more efficient at it.</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Majority of the P-TTL flashes support optical sync, where any Pentax body can act as a master to trigger the flashgun, wherever it may be sitting.  Only certain (Pentax) flashes / workarounds exist for getting Wireless HSS flash, however.  </li>
<li><strong>High-speed-sync:</strong> Ability to use a higher shutter speed than the body's sync speed.  Essential for daylight usage or any shots where the background is daylight.  Say if you're under a tent during the day, it's either blown out background or dark people without HSS.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-thyristor:</strong> The flash has a sensor on the unit to determine the correct amount of flash to output.  If you use older lenses that do not communicate aperture, you need this as P-TTL will not work on these old lenses or you are stuck in manual flash power mode.  Supposedly there is a workaround, haven't tried it.   Only the high end P-TTL models have this, and the AF360FGZ for some reason.</li>
<li><strong>Rear-curtain sync:</strong> Flashes by default fire right when the first shutter opens, as opposed to right before the second curtain closes.  This means with longer shutter speeds, if your subject is moving, the flash will have exposed the earliest part of them.  If this is a car driving in a line, it will be at the beginning of the line, as opposed to the end, which is generally not what you want.</li>
<li><strong>Recycle time:</strong> How long it takes to recharge the flash.  Pretty important during events and high flash usage.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in bounce card:</strong> I guess it's nice to always have around, but its generally very small and you can't adjust the angle.</li>
<li><strong>Modeling light:</strong> Emits a burst of flashes so you can see what the shadows look like.</li>
<li><strong>Auto off:</strong> Some flashes don't let you adjust when it automatically turns off.</li>
<li><strong>Sync-port:</strong> Some have a port where you can directly plug in a sync cable instead of requiring a hot-shoe adapter.</li>
<li><strong>Stroboscopic mode:</strong> Emit a number of flashes during the exposure for creative effect.  </li>
</ul>

<p>2) Any in-production flash that says it supports P-TTL will not do any damage.  What you are referring to are old flashes from long before P-TTL where the voltage may be too high.  Generally, if you search, you can find out the voltage and see if it is compatible.</p>

<p>You can get old flashes for pretty cheap and many work great.  The disadvantage is that they won't communicate with the camera via P-TTL.  Many flashes have auto thyristor, or you can use manual mode.  This means you can't just set whatever camera settings you want and have the flash compensate, but rather you need to set Aperture/ISO (flash speeds are generally so fast that shutter can be left to you to play with for creative effect)  based on the flash's settings.  My old AF280T (highly recommended for a cheap flash to play with) did seem to somewhat communicate in some modes, but I'm not really sure how well it worked.</p>

<p>IMHO, the best value flashes with most of the features and great power are the Sigma EF-530 DG Super and the Metz 48 AF-1.  Having used the Sigma EF-500 DG Super (just less power than the 530) and the Metz 48 AF-1, I can detail differences if you'd like.  </p>

<p>3) Speedlight is a name used by Nikon and Canon to name their hotshoe flashes.  I will assume you mean strobes, which generally refer to studio lighting where they are hooked up to a battery pack or wall.  These are bigger, have much more power for going through large umbrellas/soft boxes, and do not go on a camera.  They often have faster recycle times and a model lighting mode.  You can trigger them with a Pentax system using a sync cord or wireless gadgets like Pocketwizard or Cactus.</p>

<p>A good guide to Pentax flashes can be found <a href=""http://pttl.mattdm.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  It is pretty thorough, and he is in the process of updating it with any other differences that are pointed out. </p>

"How to capture the scene exactly as my eyes can see?","17819","","<p>What settings of my DSLR camera will emulate the scene exactly as I can see through my naked eyes?</p>

<p>I think it's not possible to get the contrast and colors exactly as my eyes can see, and it may vary from person to person. So, I am more interested in focal length of the lens. If anyone can give more insight beyond focal length, I will be glad to know.</p>

<p>For example, if I am standing on the seashore and want to capture the sunrise, what should be the focal length so that I can cover the angle of view which my eyes can see, and so the size of the objects in the photo will be precisely like my eyes perceive it?</p>

<p>My camera is an APS-C Canon EOS 1000D. I have 50mm 1.8 and 70-300mm Sigma , Can it be achieved through this equipment lens? Till now, I have not achieved or been satisfied with what I see and what I get.</p>
","<p>Well, I hate to break it to you, but you can't exactly emulate your eyes. There's a few reasons, let me explain.</p>

<ol>
<li>Humans see much higher resolution in the central fovia (center part of our eyes) than near the edges. Cameras have uniform resolution everywhere.</li>
<li>The dynamic range is handled differently between cameras and humans. I can't explain it, but a scene appears to have more dynamic range to a human than a camera, although technically a camera has more dynamic range.</li>
<li>Humans see in 3 dimensions.</li>
<li>Humans change their focal points very quickly, to the point that we don't actually notice the out of focus portions of most scenes.</li>
<li>The shape of human vision is very different than a photograph. Photographs come out rectangular typically, with some dimension, human vision is more of a curved shape, although it is difficult to quantify by the way our brain manages the signals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notwithstanding all of that, let me just say that it depends if you are wanting to focus on a specific area, or on the larger scene around. If you want the specific area, you probably should go about 150mm or so. As for a dramatic landscape, something more like a 24 will get your entire field of view. A commonly cited number is 50mm, which will let you see the higher resolution portion of your eyes and then some, but not the entire field, and is usually a good compromise. (All of these assume you have a full framed camera, if yours is a crop sensor, please divide by the appropriate factor)</p>

"How does Peter Lik manage to capture the stars in such detail in the following photograph?","17726","","<p>Here's the picture: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uLxAl.jpg"" alt=""Tree of the Universe""></p>

<p>I'm curious to know what techniques (i.e. shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc...) he uses to capture the stars so vibrantly (assuming it wasn't Photoshopped). I'm guessing it was taken with a long exposure but I'm sure there's more to that. Was any special equipment and/or lenses used? Are photographs like this possible on prosumer DSLRs (i.e. Canon 7D)?</p>
","<p>A very long exposure doesn't help with shots like this due to the rotation of the Earth. Depending on your field of view you can get star trails (where instead of individual points of light you get lines where the stars have moved relative to the camera) with exposures of only 10 seconds. With a wide angle lens you can get away with longer exposures, e.g. 30 seconds.</p>

<p>A tracking mount can eliminate star trails for pure astro shots, but this shot has a sharp foreground element which means short exposure (unless multiple exposures/tracking mounts and photoshop were involved, benefit of the doubt let's say they weren't). Fortunately modern DSLRs are far better in low light than film cameras ever were, and to make up the short exposure you can amplify the signal (by raising the ISO setting). Even a really noisy image can look good when resized for the web so don't be afraid  to set the ISO as high as you need for a proper exposure.</p>

<p>In summary this sort of image can be shot using a 7D with the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloudless skies</li>
<li>No light pollution (a long way from any human settlement)</li>
<li>Fast lens, ideally f/1.4</li>
<li>Single exposure 10-30 seconds</li>
<li>Crank up the ISO!</li>
<li>Noise reduction + massive downsize for the web.</li>

What does the chip do?
I realize I have to use manual focus and actually everything manual.</p>

<p>I tried to research but all I get is lenses on sale.</p>
","<p>It probably uses the electrical contacts in post-AI bodies to tell the camera the maximum aperture of the lens so the camera can calculate correct exposure.</p>

<p>light levels are measured with the lens at max aperture, the camera needs to know what that is so it can work out how many stops to reduce aperture. Or to set speed in aperture-priority mode.</p>

<hr>

<p>The B&amp;H description of that lens says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It includes a special chip that allows the lens to work with the camera's focus confirm, auto exposure, auto metering and auto white balance functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rokinon catalogue says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AE (Auto Exposure/""Chipped""): Capabilities include focus confirmation with fine tuning, exposure modes Auto/P/A/S/M and EXIF data.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Nikon electrical contacts are proprietary - meaning Nikon publish no information about it and you probably have to be a lens-maker under NDA to get details. SOme information is available from patents and other sources</p>

<hr>

<p>Aperture rings on F-mount lenses are redundant on most Nikon bodies produced this millenium. Early Nikon AF lenses with aperture rings typically have a lock so that the ring could be locked at the lenses smallest aperture. The camera controls the aperture. Later lenses (G designation) omit any aperture ring.</p>

"What is a reasonable formula for depreciation of photography equipment?","17681","","<p>I've recently started a company for my photography pursuits and am trying to lay down accounting terms on how will equipment be depreciated to help planning cash flow for sustainable balance sheet. </p>

<p>Perhaps I'm being naive, but I hope the balance sheet would approximately reflect true value of company assets. On the other hand, I would not want to track market value of each item separately, hoping that separating items into categories (e.g. bodies, lenses, flashes, lighting accessories, computer software, computer hardware) and having a depreciation formula for each category would do.</p>

<p>Based on what I've read so far, I'm inclining towards reducing value of bodies 25% a year; flashes and accessories 20% a year; lenses 10% a year. But I could be way off.</p>

<p>How does photographic equipment depreciate over time?</p>
","<p>There are two things here - there's the balance sheet and there's reality:</p>

<p>For the reality part you should plan your cash flow and expenses so you have money for equipment, for example, the top of the line Canon and Nikon DSLRs cost something in the $6000-$7000 range, so if you use them and you replace bodies every 4 years you should make sure to have $7000 per camera extra cash left over every 4 years - depreciation doesn't really comes into play here.</p>

<p>For the balance sheet your government has strict rules about depreciation and if you don't follow them you will get into trouble, those rules that can be simple or extremely complex depending on where you are and how your business is structured - but they generally have absolutely nothing to do with the real market value of used gear.</p>

<p>You have to take care of both aspects, if you don't plan according to your gear replacement schedule with no regard to depreciation you won't have money to replace your gear - and if you don't depreciate your gear strictly according to the rules you can get into really big trouble.</p>

"What are best-practices for personal photo organization in Aperture?","17605","","<p>I'm curious about best practices for photo and project organization. I'm starting to have too many projects to just have them listed by date, like iPhoto does. I've recently switched to Aperture, and see that there are endless ways of organizing photos.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like Apple recommends a particular method for organizing, which I would otherwise start out with. What do people do?</p>

<p>I've seen suggestions to do nested folders of year/month/project, but this seems like a lot of bookkeeping for me, and I don't really remember or care whether my trip to California was in July 2006 or August 2006.</p>

<p>I've also seen category/client/project name, but I'm not a professional, and a lot of my photos would fall into a friends, family &amp; vacation category.</p>

<p>Or should I just give up on organizing project and try to use keywords on individual photos?</p>
","<p>Photo organization is one of those things where I think it's hard to nail down 'best practices' because there are lots of different needs (I organize my professional work somewhat differently than my personal work) and every person seems to have a variation that seems 'most correct' to them (perfectly valid). With that being said my overall goal was to have a system that required <strong>as few levels of folder structure as possible to fully sort as many of my photographs as possible</strong>. The <em>last</em> thing I wanted was to have to drill down through 4 (or 6... or 8(!)) folders in order actually get to my photographs. So here's what I ended up doing:</p>

<p><strong>Professional Work:</strong></p>

<p>I do both commercial and client-based work, bust what has seemed to work best for me is to organize everything based on the following hierarchy:</p>

<p>[Client Name] -> [Project Date - Project 'Short Title'] -> Photographs</p>

<p>I format the date as YYYY.MM.DD, so that the projects all sort in date order, but as often as not it's the 'short title' that I end up looking for because I tend to name my projects in my mind, whether they're a 'Wedding Shoot' or a 'Product Shoot,' or whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Work:</strong></p>

<p>I name in a somewhat similar method to above, but instead of the top-level being the client, I use the year:</p>

<p>[YYYY] -> [Photoshoot Date - Photoshoot 'Short Title'] -> Photographs</p>

<p>Again, the 'short title' tends to be something memorable to me ('Hawaii plants', 'Park Photowalk,' whatever). I also do take the time to give a tag everything as I've found that I have a good enough memory that I'm able to recall with 'reasonable' accuracy the personal shoots that I've done over the last couple of years, but as the memory fades I find myself thinking things like <em>'what was that one shoot I did with the awesome looking cloud next to that building...'</em> and at that point keyword searching becomes my best friend.</p>

<p>The other piece to the puzzle for me is in my culling procedures... This is what I use to trim down the photographs that either aren't that good, or that I'm probably never going to use (or miss!) if I delete them. That's a whole different topic, but if you're curious you can find more info over at ""<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8236/whats-a-good-strategy-for-choosing-what-to-keep/8242#8242"">What's a good strategy for choosing what to keep.</a>""</p>

What sets this tripod apart is the 'center column' can <strong>tilt a full 90 degrees off axis</strong> (and anywhere in between) which was a huge plus back when I was really into macro.  You can setup your tripod and (with a counterweight) send your camera about 12"" out away from the tripod's center!  This is great for when you want to shoot down over something, or there is an obstruction (like a fence or rock) that is preventing you from centering your tripod right in front of your subject and then you can slide it back/forth.</p>

<p>Also, since the center column can tilt a full 90' you can drop the tripod to <em>ground level</em>, putting your camera inches above the ground, many other center column tripods can't go any lower than the length of their center column.</p>

"Is it lenses which make your photographs, not camera bodies?","17536","","<p>I read somewhere on this site itself that you should spend more on your lenses and less on your camera bodies.</p>

<p>Is it a myth or a fact that mostly it is the lenses which make your photographs not the camera bodies? If it is true, then on what basis?</p>
","<p>It's a bit of both.</p>

<p>Everything that the camera has to work with comes to it through the lens. If the lens is horribly soft (that is, it gives low-contrast and not very sharp images) when you do everything right, then it doesn't make a lot of difference what camera it's attached to, you're not going to be able to get razor-sharp images with a lot of ""pop"". The same goes for any of the optical characteristics of a lens -- the camera can't give you a wider maximum aperture, lower distortion, etc.†</p>

<p>So there is a minimum level of optical quality below which you really don't want to fall when selecting lenses, and there really is no substitute for having the right class of lens for the job (whether that means having a wide maximum aperture or the right focal length).</p>

<p>And there are handling issues to consider as well -- many of the ""kit"" lenses and crop-sensor superzooms are optically very good (some are actually excellent), but they're almost impossible to focus manually because they have only a very narrow ring of knurled plastic way out on the far end of a wobbly set of focus tubes to work with. If you don't focus manually, you'd never notice, but a Zen master on Valium could easily find himself smashing what is otherwise an acceptable lens to smithereens (and kicking kittens) if manual focus was important to him. And some lenses that get the optics very right but saved money on the construction exhibit zoom or focus creep -- the glass in the lens is heavier than the mechanical bits can handle, so when you point the lens up or down, gravity does its thing and changes your settings.</p>

<p>All of that said, though, a lens can't fix all of the problems with a camera either. If you need to shoot, say, people in very low ambient light, it's a lot easier (though only slightly less expensive) to find a camera that will let you work at ISO 25,600 than it is to find a lens with an f/0.35 maximum aperture (and if you did find the lens, you'd have to decide which part of which eyelash on which person you wanted in focus, since everything else will be thoroughly blurred). And on the camera I use hand-held and in the field most of the time,‡ a 6MP Nikon D70, there isn't enough resolution on the sensor for me to see the difference between an excellent lens and one that's merely very good -- I could spend a fortune on the very best lenses, but until I change cameras I can't see the difference in my photographs. So yes, the camera body makes a much bigger difference in the digital era than it did in the film era. But it still can't make up for a horrible lens.</p>

<p>And let's be realistic, too -- the lens you <em>can</em> afford and <em>actually use</em> to take pictures will always be better than the brilliant but expensive pinnacle of the lensmaker's art that never gets closer to you than your Amazon wish list. When it comes right down to it, it's much better to have a $300 dollar Samyang on your camera, with all of its flaws and foibles, than an $1800 Nikkor locked away safely in your local photo boutique. The picture you can't take never comes out well.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/18395/2719"">Nir said</a>, the photographer, not the tools, is the biggest limiting factor.</p>

<p><sup>† Both cameras and some outboard processing software can remove things like geometric distortion (barrel and pincushion), vignetting and lateral chromatic abberation after the fact by calculating what the image would have looked like without the problems, but that always involves losing some of the original data.</sup></p>

"Does a bigger aperture create better photos?","17499","","<p>I have observed that the wider the aperture, the more expensive the lenses are. However, I would like to know whether it really makes a difference in your photos or not?</p>
","<p>Yes, there are several reasons for this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Larger apertures allow for a smaller depth of field, and generally better bokeh.</li>
<li>Faster/more accurate auto focus, because more light is available to the focus system.</li>
<li>Much more versatility, because more light falls on the sensor at a wide aperture, which opens up your options in lower-light settings.</li>
<li>Better image quality.  This is a little more complicated to explain, but imagine you have an option between an f/2.0 lens, or an f/8 lens.  If you shoot the same scene with both set to f/8, the f/2.0 will almost always be sharper and have less vignetting.  This is because lenses tend to get soft when they are wide open, and by stopping down partially you can improve both sharpness, as well as decrease the light fall-off that creates vignetting.</li>

<li>in more than 50% of the cases there is nothing to do (for example recovering a license plate that is 5x2 pixels is completely impossible with any software on the world);</li>
<li>in about 30% of the cases we can get some little result (for example restoring some letter of a license plate or improve the overall appearance of a face);</li>
<li>in 10% of the cases you get good results (you get most of the license plate, for example).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that all these cases had severe quality issues. If their quality was good, we weren't asked to work on them.</p>

<p>For what regards specifically <strong>resolution enhancement</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you zoom on an image you are interpolating missing pixels: from a single image you can improve visually the appearance of the image but you will <em>not add any real detail</em>;</li>
<li>super resolution techniques may yield good results under certain conditions: you should have enough frames, shifted by a non integer amount of pixels and preferably with few compression artifacts. In the best case you can expect good results within 2x and 3x zoom.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is shown in the video clip can be possible only if the original video has been shoot at several megapixels and then you will have the resolution to zoom very close (more or less like you do on Google Maps). Of course, at that point there still would be other problems, like the right focus, low light condition, the fact that the perspective of the eye is different from that of the whole subject in the video, just to mention a few.</p>

"What are standard lighting setups for 2-3 people?","17338","","<p>What are some standard lighting setups for two or three people in a group?  I just can't think of non-complicated setups that would apply some previously discussed (short, broad, butterfly, split, etc) lighting setups to groups of people.</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, there are two schools of thought on lighting setups for groups. I'll cover what you're <em>not</em> talking about (for completeness) before I talk about your question directly...</p>

<p><strong>School #1 - Light Individuals</strong></p>

<p>This school of thought essentially says that even in a group portrait, every subject is treated as an individual, and is lit individually. The pros of this method are probably obvious- fine-grained control over every single subject in the shot, and (if you do it right) amazing 'magazine-ready' shots. The cons, of course, are that it is expensive (because you need lots of lights, accessories, assistants, etc.), and time consuming (because you have lots of variables). These are the types of shoots that take 8 hours to set up, and 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>If done right, however, the results are unachievable by any other method. For the most part because of the cost and manpower involved in setting up shoots this way, it is exclusively the realm of advertising photography and magazine editorial shoots. I know several people who have 'begged, borrowed, and rented' their way into self-funding shoots like this for their portfolios, and the shots the captured instantly became the centerpieces of their work, because these types of shots look stunning, and there's really no way to 'fake' it.</p>

<p><strong>School #2 - Light the Group</strong></p>

<p>For the rest of us 'mere mortals' lighting groups (large or small) is often an exercise in compromise. The basic goal needs to be to evenly light each face in the group. Most of the time when lighting groups the 'artistry' of lighting setups takes a backseat to simply getting everyone lit with an 'acceptable' level of lighting. The easiest group lighting setups aren't much more than variations on the basic <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/6495/in-portrait-photography-what-is-broad-lighting-what-is-short-lighting/6496#6496"">short-lighting setup</a>, but widened out to fit the group. With a smaller group, this can often be accomplished with a single light source (whether natural, or artificial) and a reflector on the opposite side... Maybe with a light to separate the background and/or a hair light if you have enough light sources to accomplish it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eoo8V.jpg"" alt=""Basic group lighting setup diagram""></p>

<p>Things like hair lights, rim lights, separations lights, kickers, etc. can be added over and above the key light and reflector, but those lights would comprise what I think of as a 'basic plus' lighting setup. For a group of 2 or 3, the bare minimum you'll need boils down to just a key light and a reflector. I know working professional portrait photographers who use this 1-light setup almost exclusively- it's a powerful setup, and can easily be the base setup for the majority of group (and even individual) portraits you are likely to encounter.</p>

<p>For larger groups, this will almost always require a second lighting source opposite the key light to act as a fill and prevent shadows because more power will be needed than a reflector can provide. <em>(Note that extras like hair light and separation light have been omitted for clarity. They can certainly be added if you have the lights.)</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLCTI.jpg"" alt=""Larger group lighting setup diagram""></p>

<p>The other thing of real importance when lighting groups is arranging everyone so that no person is casting a shadow onto another member of the group. This is sometimes easier said that done! Generally speaking, the more that you can bring everyone's faces onto a single plane (by, for example, having those in the back row lean forward), the easier this will be. With group portraits I generally find that it's best to slow down and spend the 5 or 10 minutes getting the arrangement right before beginning to take pictures, but 'arranging groups' is probably an entire topic in itself. :-)</p>

"What steps to take to match screen to print?","17315","","<p>I don't print a TON of my photos, but when I do it's because it's really important to me.  I've got a MacBook Pro attached to a Samsung 2300 display and an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000ACOW0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HP Photosmart 7760</a> printer.  I typically use Lightroom for OSX, but occasionally will make use of Aperture if the mood strikes.</p>

<p>What steps should I take to ensure that my print matches what I see when editing the photo?  I've got a monitor calibrator, so I'm using the calibrated display profile.  What do I need to do with my printer or Lightroom, though?  Should Lightroom, the printer, or something else manage the color profile? </p>

<p>I'm looking at buying a much higher quality printer (Canon Pixma Pro) but want to make sure I know how to get the most out of my prints before I spend any money.</p>
","<p><strong>Calibration</strong></p>

<p>First off, the obvious stuff: Calibrate your monitor, and use appropriate ICC profiles for your printer/ink/papers. You mentioned you already have a calibrated monitor, and for the most part, you should be able to find quality ICC profiles for your printer and the papers you use on the net (I use a Canon PIXMA 9500Pro myself, and make use of a very wide variety of papers...there have only been a couple occasions where I've had to generate my own profile.)</p>

<p><strong>Soft Proofing</strong></p>

<p>Having a calibrated screen and proper printer ICC profiles is a good start, but it is generally not enough alone. To really match what you see in print to what you see on screen, you need to <strong>soft proof</strong>. Lightroom 4 Beta brings some basic soft proofing tools to the table, however for some of the best, you should really turn to Photoshop. Photoshop has some amazing capabilities when your soft proofing that help you properly match your print to what you see on screen.</p>

<p><strong>Screen/Printer Differences</strong></p>

<p>Even with proper calibration, there are still some fundamental differences between a computer screen and a printer. The most obvious is the fact that screens are luminously transmissive, emitting RGB light, which conforms to the <strong>additive color model</strong>; conversely, printers are reflective, producing light by reflecting CMYK (and possibly many more) colors from ink on paper, which conforms to the <strong>subtractive color model</strong>. Because computer screens are transmissive, they tend to have greater dynamic range, and often larger gamut (although the gap is closing these days with special papers and advanced inks.)</p>

<p>The difference in color model and emission can create a visible difference in a print from what you see on screen, even when everything is properly calibrated. Print will generally be duller, and even with the best inks, bright primary and secondary color saturation will rarely reach the same levels as possible on screen. Similarly, maximum black and brightest white are limited by ink formula and density and paper brightness, respectively. With a modern wide-gamut printer like a PIXMA Pro, color gamut correction will probably be less of an issue than white and black point correction.</p>

<p><strong>Correcting for Print</strong></p>

<p>If you want maximum accuracy when you print, there are a few things you can do before hand. First and foremost is to make sure you have the best ICC profile you can find for your printer and paper. Second, make sure you select the right ICM Rendering Intent before printing or soft proofing. Generally, <strong>Perceptual</strong> will maintain the perception of print-to-screen accuracy, and is probably recommended. If actual-color accuracy is more important than perceptual accuracy, you may want to switch to <strong>Relative Colorimetric</strong>.</p>

<p>Before printing, you should create a <em>printer, paper and print size</em> specific copy of your photo. Once you have this copy, final and <em>manual resizing and sharpening</em> for the exact <em>print size/border size</em> you want should be performed. You can always leave sizing up to the printer, but the results are usually unpredictable. Save this copy before proceeding to soft proof.</p>

<p>Enable soft proofing in Photoshop, and make sure you choose to adjust black point, simulate paper, and pick the correct ICC print profile and ICM rendering intent. You should see your image change, probably become a bit duller, and be rendered on a different color background that should approximate your paper. If there is a large deviation in the simulated paper vs. your real paper, you might want to try creating an ICC screen profile that improves matching. (Personally, I use the DataColor Spyder Elite, which includes a utility to easily switch color profiles. I have a variety of color profiles that I can switch to with different white points, so I can quickly match my work environment to my paper...or at least get a better match.) </p>

<p>Once in soft proofing mode, the first thing you will want to look at is white and black point. I start with blacks, and use the hot key to enable/disable soft proofing. A fair amount of the time, fine detail in blacks will disappear when soft proofing against a specific print profile. Sometimes, you may see fine black detail is too bright, although its rarer. You can correct this with the levels tool by tweaking the minimum black or black point. Similarly, if you see any highlights that are blown out in soft proof only, you can correct this by using the levels tool to shift white point down. You can actually adjust most settings while soft proofing is enabled, to see the results directly. Any adjustments made while soft proofing will persist, so when soft proofing is disabled, it you'll still see their effects on the image itself.</p>

<p>If you are printing on a paper or with inks that have a particularly limited gamut, you may want to check out of gamut colors as well. You can do this in soft proofing mode, and it will highlight areas of your image in gray that have color values beyond the capabilities of your printer. Generally speaking, if you only see minor spots where gamut is out, and you are using relative colorimetric or perceptual rendering intents, you can leave everything as is...ICM will take care of it all for you. If you see large areas of your print out of gamut, you might want to spend some time either printing test images to see how the out of gamut colors actually render, and if they do render incorrectly, you might want to try correcting them in soft proofing mode. There are a variety of techniques for correcting out of gamut color...I'll leave researching those as an exercise for the reader. The simplest approach is to adjust range-limited saturation down a bit to bring colors back into gamut (although that can have its own side effects.) For the most part, outside of extreme cases, let ICM deal with correcting color for you.</p>

<p>Finally, I highly recommend you make all adjustments using adjustment layers in photoshop, rather than directly. You can always disable them that way, compare differences with various adjustments enabled or not, easily toggle adjustments for different test prints, etc. </p>

"How can I find a compact camera with an ultra-wide lens?","17305","","<p>I'm looking to buy a compact camera, and having a very wide angle is important to me. I know that review sites often list the real focal length of the lens, but what I'm looking for is something that will show me current models with actually wide field of view. Is there such a resource?</p>
","<p>There are several web sites which collect information on camera models and provide convenient ways to narrow down to specific options that fit what you need. My favorite is part of the the <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Neocamera</a> site. You can use the <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/search_camera.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Camera Search</a> to narrow down the field by camera type and by focal length in 35mm equivalent terms.</p>

<p>""35mm equivalent"" is a little confusing, but, simply, cameras have many different sensor sizes, and by normalizing all of the information to a standard, we can compare between different camera systems and know we're talking about the same field of view. (And, 35mm film camera frame size happens to be the industry standard)</p>

<p>So, the following search will show all current compact cameras with a widest focal length of at least 24mm-e, which is widely (um, pun intended; sorry) regarded as the cut-off where ""<a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/10031/1943"">ultra-wide</a>"" begins:</p>

<p>We can also try just a teensy bit wider, limiting to <em>23mm</em> or wider, which as of mid-2013 gives no results:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or, we can switch from compact to ultra-compact:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>which Neocamera defines as cameras up to 28mm at the thickest point. (Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to get the two searches in a combined report, but that's probably okay because there's too many to wade through in one look anyway.)</p>

<p>You could also do a <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/products/search/cameras#criterias=SpecsCoreParams%2CSpecsZoomWide%2CAnnouncementYear&amp;includeDiscontinued=No&amp;sort=newestFirst&amp;view=list&amp;page=1&amp;paramSpecsCoreParamsBodyType=Compact%2CUltraCompact%2CSLRLike%2CLargeSensorCompact&amp;paramSpecsZoomWide=24-&amp;paramAnnouncementYearMin=2012"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">similar search on DP Review</a>, and while their interface is a little more modern and slick, I actually find it more unwieldy. (Checkboxes on the top of the page make sliders appear or disappear down below, and then you set those sliders to change the cameras which appear on a list below that, and then in that list you have to dig further to get to camera details. On the other hand, you <em>can</em> include multiple camera types at once, and it's easier if you want, for example, to know what cameras were released between 1994 and 1998.)</p>

Then follows two comparative values: 14.4 EV for Nikon and 11.7 EV for Canon. Can some one explain the meaning of this value, and how much difference does 2.7 EV really represent?</p>
","<p><strong>DXO</strong></p>

<p>I addition to some of the excellent answers that have already been provided, I'd like to add a small word of caution about DXO's dynamic range numbers. First off, Dynamic Range as defined by DXO is officially the ratio between the saturation point and the RMS of read noise. That is a little different than the ratio between the brightest pixels and the darkest pixels that contain image data...it is actually possible for useful image data and read noise to be interleaved, especially with a Canon sensor (which does not clip negative signal info like Nikon does.)</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Range <em>for Photographers</em></strong></p>

<p>Dynamic range, as far as a photographer is concerned, has to do with two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The amount of noise in the image (particularly the read noise in the shadows).</li>
<li>The post-process exposure editing latitude.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these factors are important, however both do not necessarily mean the same thing as far as what you get in the end. This is why DXO actually offers TWO measures of dynamic range. Both need to be read in the proper context to fully understand what they mean, and how they might affect your workflow and/or results.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Range is NOT the whole story!!</strong></p>

<p>First, before I start, I have to offer my most valuable piece of advice I can: Dynamic Range is NOT the whole story!! Dynamic range is ONE aspect of image quality. Overall, image quality is produced by multiple factors. The image sensor is one of those factors, and dynamic range is only one factor of an image sensor...resolution, quantum efficiency, signal to noise ratio, etc. are other important factors of image sensors. In addition to image sensors, cameras also have AF systems (and within AF systems, you have total AF points, point layout, point spread, point selection modes, etc.), metering sensors, frame rates and buffer depths, body ergonomics, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Photographers buy CAMERAS.</strong> We don't buy sensors. ;) If you are in the market to buy a camera, make sure you buy the camera that best suits your overall needs. Don't base your decision on one single factor out of a myriad of factors. Depending on the kind of things you photograph, you may need a high performance AF system and a fast frame rate more than you need anything else, including DR!</p>

<p><em>Research cameras, don't research sensors.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Range: Noise</strong></p>

<p>The first factor we can derive from dynamic range is how much noise is in an image signal on a <strong>normalized basis.</strong> That last term there is important: on a normalized basis. When you are comparing cameras, it helps to have a level playing field. To achieve a level playing field when producing camera ratings from POST-camera information (i.e. a RAW image), one must scale the image being measured to a standard ""output size."" This allows different cameras with different hardware specifications to be compared ""normally"", or in other words, directly. Without normalization, you usually might as well compare apples to oranges.</p>

<p>Normalizing image size has an interesting effect. It reduces ALL noise in an image. Not just read noise, but the intrinsic noise present in the image signal itself (you may have heard this called ""photon shot noise."") Read noise only exists in the shadows, and without any additional processing, is usually invisible. For the most part, for direct camera comparisons, the amount of read noise is a lesser factor (although still an important one). The more important factor is photon shot noise, or the noise intrinsic to the signal. </p>

<p>In the context of DXOs measurements, <strong>Print DR</strong> is the measure of <em>normalized results</em>. When it comes to normalized results, pixel count and quantum efficiency reign supreme. If we take the classic 5D III and D800 comparison on DXO, you have ~11.7 stops of ISO 100 Print DR vs. ~14.4 stops of ISO 100 Print DR. That seems like a massive difference. As far as Print DR goes, it is. In part, the 5D III suffers because of high read noise at ISO 100, but the other and possibly more significant factor is the fact that the D800 has significantly more pixels, and a considerably higher Q.E. per pixel. </p>

<p>The D800's smaller pixels are already more sensitive to light, so the total light gathering efficiency of <em>the sensor</em>, which is the same physical dimensions, is higher than the 5D III. It is important to note that even though each of the 5D III pixels themselves have a higher FWC (full well capacity) each, overall they are each less efficient (49% vs. 56%) at converting photons to usable charge. When you factor in the total sensor area, the 5D III has a 49% efficiency over 864mm^2, where as the D800 has 56% efficiency over the same exact area.  It is also important to note that if one were to directly compare the 5D III <em>pixels</em> to the D800 <em>pixels</em>, you would actually need to compare 1 5D III pixel to 1.63 D800 pixels, since only then would you be comparing the same absolute area of each sensor. Because of the D800's higher Q.E., on an area-normal basis, ""maximum saturation"" is higher than for the 5D III: The D800 ""saturation per area"" at ISO 100 (1.62 pixels worth of charge saturation) is ~73200e-, where as for the 5D III ""saturation per area"" at ISO 100 (1.0 pixels worth of charge saturation) is 67531e-. The D800 clearly has the stronger signal. </p>

<p>Image for image, the total signal strength will always be higher with the D800, so intrinsic noise will always be less. Read noise, which is usually <em>the culprit</em> as far as DR is concerned in most photographers minds, is actually the smaller factor here...however it does further eat away at the lesser total signal of the 5D III by a small amount, further hurting its signal to noise ratio when you actually measure it.</p>

<p>Now comes in the normalization part. To compare the D800 directly to the 5D III, you have to normalize. That means, scaling both images to the same dimensions. In the case of DXO, their normalized comparison target is 3600x2400, which matches the standard 3:2 ratio of modern DSLR sensors. The D800 started out with an advantage in total signal strength. It also has the advantage in pixel count. When you downsample a D800 image, you downsample a slightly better image (~8% better, from a signal strength standpoint) and with 63% more pixels than the 5D III. </p>

<p>All those extra pixels the D800 has allow a greater degree of <em>averaging</em> (the blending of multiple source pixels to produce a single destination pixel via some kind of average/mean/median) during the downsampling, which results in significantly less noise overall. Not just in the deep black shadows, where read noise exists, but at all tonal levels. You have less noise in the blacks, shadows, the midtones, the highlights and the whites. The 5D III has fewer pixels to contribute to that averaging process, so it has slightly more noise across the entire tonal range. In addition, the 5D III started out with that higher read noise, which while also reduced by downsampling, is reduced less than the D800's because there was less averaging involved, and it was more than the D800's read noise to start. </p>

<p>So when Print DR is actually measured from these two ""normalized"" 3200x2400 pixel comparison images, the D800 has a significant edge. Hence the reason it gets ""<em>2.7</em> stops"" more Print DR than the 5D III, 14.4 vs. 11.7. </p>

<p>Hopefully all of that made sense. When it comes to Print DR, read noise plays a roll, but the maximum signal strength of the entire sensor (not just each individual pixel) plays a more important role. Print DR, however, because it is based on <strong>MODIFIED</strong> images, is <em>NOT</em> directly representative of the capabilities of <strong>camera <em>hardware</em></strong>. It is useful primarily, and perhaps only, as a <em>comparative tool</em>...to match camera statistics and use the differences to determine which camera is ""better"" (better statistically on the image sensor front only...but that doesn't necessarily tell you whether one camera is really better than another).</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Range: Exposure Editing Latitude</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so now that an explanation of Print DR is out of the way, it's time to hone in on <strong>Screen DR</strong>. As I mentioned before, Print DR is a measure of <strong>modified</strong> images, in order to use <em>normalized</em> camera output to produce comparisons that are useful when compared <em>directly</em>. Because the images generated by each camera are usually different sizes, normalization results in a different degree of processing for each camera in order to produce comparable results. The 5D III images needs to be downsampled to a lesser degree than the D800 images. There is a greater degree of change with the D800 image. </p>

<p>As such, Print DR does not necessarily tell you <em>explicit details</em> about <em>camera <strong>hardware</em></strong>. It tells you <em>relative</em> details about camera images, and it tells you about the effectiveness of a computer algorithm at processing one camera brand's images vs. another. It does not, however, actually tell you anything concrete about the actual real-world performance of a camera sensor.</p>

<p>DXO offers Screen DR measurements as well. Screen DR is more of a hardware measure. Screen DR is taken directly from each camera's RAW image files, without any interim processing. When it comes to Screen DR, because there is no averaging that mitigates the impact of read noise, read noise plays a more significant role. Quantum efficiency and particularly pixel counts take a lesser role. Screen DR is the ratio between true maximum saturation and the RMS of read noise as measured directly from the RAW pixel values in the actual camera RAW files. Therefor, Screen DR is about as directly related to real-world hardware performance as you can get. </p>

<p>In the case of the D800 vs. the 5D III, the D800 has 13.2 stops of Screen DR, while the 5D III has 10.97 stops of Screen DR. In terms of the D800's advantage, it's dropped from 2.7 stops to 2.2 stops, almost 2/3rds of a stop less. This indicates the real-world advantage of the D800 over the 5D III for RAW editing, specifically for exposure editing latitude...the amount of additional recovery range you have when working with a RAW in post with a tool like Adobe Lightroom. We'll get back to this in a moment.</p>

<p>The D800 still maintains the advantage, however. Why? In this case, pixel count doesn't play much of a role. The only real role pixel count plays here is that in order to pack more pixels into the same space, you must reduce pixel size. Quantum efficiency plays the lesser role here, as while the D800 pixels are smaller, they are still more efficient than the 5D III pixels, allowing a stronger signal than if their Q.E. were to be the same (~45ke- @ 56% Q.E. vs. ~41ke- @ 49% Q.E., a signal strength difference of almost 9%). The key factor that plays the biggest role here is read noise...and in the case of the D800, it has exceptionally low ISO 100 read noise, at ~3e-. The 5D III, on the other hand, has a very high ISO 100 read noise of over 33e-! That is a factor of ten difference relative to the D800. Even though the D800 has a lower saturation point, it's significantly lower read noise still gives it the advantage in Screen DR. The 5D III's very high read noise is killing it, despite having a higher saturation point of ~68ke-.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean? How does Screen DR compare to Print DR? Well, to put it simply: The D800 does not have 14.4 stops of dynamic range in any meaningful sense, as far as photographers should be concerned. When most photographers think of ""dynamic range"", they think of the ability to lift shadows. Shadow lifting is almost synonymous with dynamic range, because it is dynamic range that allows shadow lifting. </p>

<p>But wait, why can't you lift the shadows of a 3200x2400 pixel image? Well, there is no reason you can't...however pushing exposure around a downsampled image is not the same as pushing exposure around a RAW image. There are several reasons why you can't really count a downsampled 3200x2400 D800 image as having 14.4 stops of DR. First, if the image is a JPEG, you have at most 8 stops of DR, because JPEG images are 8-bit. If you are using a TIFF image, you have 16 bits of numeric space to store up to 16 stops of dynamic range, however regardless of image format, by downsampling, you destroyed a considerable amount of detail in your image anyway. Additionally, anything other than a RAW image is going to be saved as some kind RGB image (or maybe HSL, but generally the same difference). RGB images do not offer the same kind of low-level non-destructive editing latitude as a RAW image. You have some editing latitude, but to some degree, the five major tonal ranges...blacks, shadows, midtones, highlights, and whites, are largely fixed. You can try to lift shadows, but you can only lift them so far before editing artifacts begin to exhibit. Same goes for moving midtones or highlights around...you can push them to a certain degree, however push them too far, and editing artifacts will start to appear. </p>

<p>True editing latitude can only be achieved with RAW image editing. Now here is the kicker: We all edit RAW images at NATIVE SIZE. There is no scaling when editing RAW. It's RAW! It's an exact replica of the digital signal as represented by the camera when the exposure was made. Scaling doesn't come into the picture. When you zoom in and out in Lightroom, your not actually changing the RAW...your simply changing what is rendered to the viewport. Every time you change a setting, push exposure up or down, recover highlights or lift shadows, tweak white balance, etc. you are reprocessing the ORIGINAL RAW data and re-rendering it to the viewport. RAW is RAW, it's ALWAYS full size. </p>

<p>Therefor, the D800 has 13.2 stops of dynamic range. The 5D III has 10.97 stops of dynamic range. The relative difference between the two is ~2.2 stops, not 2.7. The D800 is therefor incapable of capturing 100% of the tonality of a 14.4 stop sunset in a single shot...you still need HDR to do that. You would barely be able to capture a 13.2 stop sunset in a single shot...but that would be the ultimate real-world limit with a D800. You wouldn't be able to capture more than 11 stops with a 5D III in a single shot. </p>

<p><strong>Picking DR</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to dynamic range measurements, especially when comparing cameras for purchase, you really need to decide on what your primary workflow will be. Are you a JPEG Junkie, firing off thousands of shots per hour at that sporting event that are ultimately going to be downsampled significantly and published on the web, or maybe downsampled to a degree and printed small? Or are you a RAW Fiend, and want the most editing latitude you can get your hands on, because you need to be able to capture as much highlight detail in the sun at the core of that sunset as you can without losing any deep shadow detail?</p>

<p>If you are just going to be downsampling and publishing tiny 900 pixel wide images on the web, then pretty much ANY camera on the market today will do. If you still want the best, then a 5D III or a D800 will both do the job superbly. Technically speaking the D800 would have more DR, however because your a JPEG junky, your not going to be able to benefit from it, since JPEG images are 8-bit, you only have 8 stops of usable DR anyway.</p>

<p>If you are a RAW Fiend, especially if you regularly photograph scenes with lots of dynamic range anyway, then the additional exposure editing latitude provided by cameras with more quantum efficiency and less read noise is going to be valuable. In these cases, you should be ignoring Print DR entirely. It is a worthless measure, even for comparing cameras. You should be looking at the Screen DR number on DXO, to find the real-world hardware dynamic range, as preserved by your RAW images. </p>

<p>The D800, and the D600, still both offer more real-world dynamic range than the 5D III, no question about that. The difference isn't quite as great as DXO's Print DR ""scores"" make it seem...the D800 and D600 are about 2/3rds of a stop less DR capable than DXO says they are in reality, but still more than two stops more DR capable than a 5D III. To put the difference in more practical terms...if you accidentally under-exposed an image by six stops, and wanted to recover it with Lightroom. If you had a 5D III, you could recover four stops...the other two stops would be lost to read noise. With a D800 or D600, you could recover all six stops.</p>

<p>One last bit, and I'll finally be done. The D800 and D600 lead in dynamic range is only relevant at ""low ISO"". Dynamic range is ultimately limited by signal to noise ratio, and with each increase in ISO, maximum dynamic range drops by one stop. By ISO 800, the difference in DR between a 5D III and a D800 is minimal, by ISO 1600 the differences are negligible, and SNR becomes the most important factor. SNR, or signal-to-noise ratio, becomes a vastly more significant factor at high ISO. The greater your SNR, the less intrinsic signal noise (photon shot noise) at high ISO. When it comes to high ISO performance, Canon cameras have the edge, and usually perform a bit better than Nikon cameras. If you factor in recent enhancements offered by Magic Lantern, Canon cameras then have a fairly significant advantage at high ISO over pretty much any other camera...offering 1/2 to 2/3 stops more dynamic range at all high ISO settings than any other camera in the same class. Magic Lantern improves high ISO performance on Canon cameras so much, that the 5D III and 6D both end up with as much or more dynamic range than the 1D X and D4 at ISOs above 400, which are cameras thousands of dollars more expensive. </p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Range is NOT the whole story!!</strong></p>

<p>Finally, before I wrap up this ludicrously long answer, I have to reiterate the most valuable piece of advice I can: Dynamic Range is NOT the whole story!! Dynamic range is ONE aspect of image quality. Overall, image quality is produced by multiple factors. The image sensor is one of those factors, and dynamic range is only one factor of an image sensor...resolution, quantum efficiency, signal to noise ratio, etc. are other important factors of image sensors. In addition to image sensors, cameras also have AF systems (and within AF systems, you have total AF points, point layout, point spread, point selection modes, etc.), metering sensors, frame rates and buffer depths, body ergonomics, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Photographers buy CAMERAS.</strong> We don't buy sensors. ;) If you are in the market to buy a camera, make sure you buy the camera that best suits your overall needs. Don't base your decision on one single factor out of a myriad of factors. Depending on the kind of things you photograph, you may need a high performance AF system and a fast frame rate more than you need anything else, including DR!</p>

"How can I prevent my lens hood from causing dark corners?","17197","","<p>I'm new to photography and I have a lens hood on my Canon Rebel XT camera/lens.  I'm getting these dark corners on some of my photographs.  No doubt they're coming from the lens hood.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  The lens hood is a Bower 58mm Pro Hood.</p>

<p>I've since abandoned using lens hoods on my camera.</p>
","<p>You don't have to abandon the lens hood!!! Hoods are good a blocking the sun, eliminating solar flares AND most importantly protecting your glass.</p>

<p>Do this...set your camera on a tripod (or table or pile of books or anything stable) and go to your widest angle avaible to you, with the lens hood on, and shoot a picture. Then zoom in a touch and do it again. Then again and again until you have you lens zoomed all the way out. </p>

<p>Now, go back through your images. Somewhere within the focal range of your lens the vignetting (dark corners) will disappear. Check the first image that is clear of the hood and check your meta data for the focal length. This will give you an idea of how wide you can go without the problem.</p>

<p>A couple of points: </p>

<p>1.You may have the wrong hood for that lens. A shorter hood may work better for you.</p>

<p>2.Some hoods have two long flanges and two short ones. If yours does, then try placing the long flanges on the top/bottom side of the lens rather than the left/right. Because of the native aspect ration of your film plane (chip, sensor, pick a name) (i.e., it is a horizontal rectangle) the long flanges will appear at the left and right of the frame rather than the top and bottom. This is because there is less sensor to ""see"" the hood on the top and bottom.</p>

<p>Good luck...don't give up.</p>

"How does one focus for landscape photos in very dark conditions?","17177","","<p>Tonight I tried my best to take some night landscapes in the darkest of dark conditions.  Hoping for an epic composition of the Milky Way and a landmark.</p>

<p>Of course, none of my glass could auto focus with nothing more than dots in the sky to lock on.  I seemed to have the most success by lining up the infinity focus mark on the focus window, however, the 50mm 1.8 has no focus window. </p>

<p>How can I set (guess) focus on a lens in relatively complete darkness?</p>

<p>Looking though the viewfinder I see nothing but black. I tried using Live View function to set focus, but that's not helpful either. I'm shooting wide open at f/2.8 or f/1.8 to gather the most amount of light in the shortest exposure, so the DoF is short, and the focus needs to be on.</p>
","<p>In the daylight focus on a very, very far away object, like a radio tower.  Mark your focusing ring with a bit of tape or something, and you have your infinity setting.</p>

<p>For closer focusing in the dark carry a laser pointer.  Tape it to the camera or tripod so it points at your subject.  The red dot should be easily seen through the viewfinder, and it will be easy to tell if you've got it in focus or not.  You will probably have to use manual focus.  Turn off the laser when taking the photo.</p>

"Why is giving clients RAW files such a sensitive matter among photographers?","17155","","<p>I've been trying to understand why handing out the RAW files to clients is a sensitive issue among professional photographers.</p>

<p>I've often heard explanations that compares the RAW files to film negatives and that I wouldn't hand them out. The answer to that is no I wouldn't, but that's not a fair analogy either. The main reason that I won't give someone my film negatives is that they're irreplaceable. I can't make copies of them without loosing quality, but I can make 1:1 copies of my RAW files and keep all data. All in all I don't really buy that explanation to why professional photographers don't give clients RAW files.</p>

<p>I wouldn't give a client RAW files either. But my reasons would be based upon things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want them to see what I had in mind to capture, not halfway through the process.</li>
<li>I don't want to risk having edits made by others potentially being presented as my work to potential clients.</li>
<li>I would want to keep RAW files alone to have the possibility to use it to help prove that the photos are mine in court.</li>
<li>If I've happened to take a keeper that I had to heavily correct in post I wouldn't want my clients to see that. That could make me appear as a bad photographer for not nailing my settings in camera.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among photographers there seem to be a strong consensus not to give clients RAW files, but I really want to know why. Is there an obvious reason that I've missed?</p>

<p>Just to be clear: This question is not about giving clients RAW files instead of JPEG, but rather RAW in addition to JPEG</p>
","<p>I do offer RAW files for my photos but I don't give them automatically purely because of the size and difficulty to use.  A RAW file is substantially larger than even a max quality finished JPEG.  Additionally, a RAW file is of no use without a photographer to develop it.  It is just raw sensor data and still needs things like color grading and exposure controls and possibly cropping before it is a good photo.</p>

<p>Personally, I offer to give copies of any RAWs the customer wants, but I also preface that with an explanation that the RAW files don't represent final works and are only useful if they are going to touch it up or have someone touch it up.</p>

<p>Many photographers don't like releasing that much control of their images.  They may be willing to release a full quality finished product even if that gets mangled, they know it started from a good place.  RAW files on the other hand could be associated back to them as a negative thing since they are not finished products and may be poorly handled.</p>

<p>Then there is the photographers who simply want to be able to charge for every use of an image and thus only provide limited quality images to start with so that you have to go back to them if you want larger prints.  Personally, I despise that practice, but it is still very common.</p>

"When should you use a normal flash vs a second-curtain flash?","17145","","<p>There have been many questions lately that focus on improving the quality of the image taken, where the answers circle around using a second-curtain flash to reduce blur and freeze motion.</p>

<p>Why not use second curtain-flash all the time? Are there down sides to second-curtain flash?</p>
","<p>Second curtain sync doesn't do anything more to freeze motion than first curtain. The reason to use second curtain sync is that the ambient light trails you get with a long exposure appear behind the subject (as the sequence is ambient first then flash) instead of in front, which looks a bit weird.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.shortcourses.com/images/b4ch6/curtainsync.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.shortcourses.com/images/b4ch6/curtainsync.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the top image (first curtain sync) the headlight trail appears in front of the train, in the bottom image (second curtain sync) the headlight trails burn in before the flash fires, so they appear behind the train.</p>

<p>Can't think of a general disadvantage of second curtain sync (I use it all the time), except that not all cameras offer true second curtain sync. Canon cameras for example only send a signal on the first curtain. Second curtain sync is then achieved by sending the shutter speed to the Canon compatible flash which knows to wait the specified time before firing.</p>

<p>One reason not to use second curtain sync might be that it's easier to frame a moving subject if you concentrate on where the subject is when you press the shutter, rather than where it will be when the shutter closes. </p>

"Suggestions for shared cross-platform photo management?","17133","","<p>I have a Mac, my wife has a Win7 machine. Currently I take all of our photos and put them into iPhoto. There's about 35K images in there now. The problem is that they are all accessible only from my Mac and she has to wait for me to put the images on there, etc.</p>

<p>I'm willing to switch away from iPhoto. I know there are some tools that are cross platform (Lightroom, Picasa), but are there any that support a shared library? I can share a volume out via NFS or CIFS that we could both mount, but I want to avoid problems of (potentially) both of us hitting the image database at the same time.</p>
","<p>The issue you are going to face is similar to any database-based solution: the issue is ownership over a file and if two systems are trying to change a file at the same time. This can often corrupt a database for systems that are not designed with this concurrency in mind, and most systems are not designed with this in mind. As mentioned above, there are some higher end solutions that are designed with this in mind, but they are expensive and typically designed with an agency in mind.</p>

<p>Assuming you do not wish to purchase an agency solution, Lightroom would do fine, <em>if</em> you did not wish to share the database and each others edits.  In this case, you would simply share an external drive with the photos themselves, but each keep your own catalog of edits local to your system.  I am not sure if Aperture works this way or not, others can perhaps chime in.</p>

<p>The only alternative to get something close to this function with Lightroom, is for you to share the hard drive of photos as above, but then, use the export/import catalog function of Lightroom to ""share' the catalog between machines. So, have your wife export a catalog of images she has edited, and then you import them into your catalog...and so on.  Not especially simple, but it will work, as long as you can put up with it.</p>

<p>Of course, if you can get by without sharing edits, then simply put all your images on a network accessible drive, point each copy of Lightroom at this shared drive and edit away. One note: when your wife adds images, they will not automatically be added to your catalog, but you can easily solve this by right clicking on the shared drive link in the Library view, and select 'Synchronize Folder"" which will add any new images to your local catalog.</p>

","<p>Do not buy a single large card - or even larger than necessary cards.<br>
 Risk of data loss is minimised by using more smaller cards.<br>
If you shoot RAW and if D3100 RAW files are around 20 MB (adjust to suit actual) you'll get about 50 photos/GB ~= 
400 / 8GB<br>
 800 / 16 GB<br>
 1600 / 32 GB<br>
 3200 / 64 GB</p>

<p>JPG will give substantially  more.<br>
 In almost any setting, having to change card every 400 photos is not a major imposition.<br>
 With say 4 x 8MB cards and swapping cards 'every now and then' and using all 4 cards, you will lose about 1/4 of the photos taken since copying if a card fails.<br>
 With 1 x 32 GB or 1 x 64 GB you will lose 100% WHEN the card fails.</p>

<p>If you have at least 2 x 16 GB you can transfer files from one while using the other.<br>
 Similarly with 4 x 8 GB.<br>
 This could be portable hard drive with peer to peer module, netbook, tablet etc.<br>
 Nowadays some smart phones will probably allow you to use a USB card reader to backup a card to the phone's 32 GB t-Flash. The phone's memory can be slower and so cheaper per GB.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Re card speed:</strong>  In most cases a 10 MB/s Class 10 from a reputable manufacturer will suffice.  With 20 MB RAW files a 10 MB/s card will take 2s to write and a 45 MB/s card about 0.5s. This is if those are genuine write speeds and if the camera can support 45 MB/s. Clone cards with fake labels and cards labelled for read rather than write speeds may cause bad surprises.</p>

<p>If you really must shoot RAW and must have > 1 frame/s then the 45 MB/s card may help. Camera buffer size and design will set max shots before buffer stutter starts.<br>
 IF the camera allows unlimited RAW shots if there is buffer room then<br>
 Buffer fill time is ABOUT  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Buffer size in MB) / (Camera data rate - card write rate)  </p>

<p>= (Buffer size in MB) / (File_size x frames_per_second - Card_write_rate)  </p>

<p>eg if camera produces 4 x RAW at 20 MB each per second.<br>
If buffer is 64 MB<br>
If write rate is 45 MB/s<br>
Fill time is ~= 64 MB / (80-45) = 64/35 or under 2 seconds.<br>
Buffer size is crucial in situations where camera rate exceeds card write rate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>More normally - say you write 10 MB files, use a 10 MB/s card, shoot 4 frames/s and have a 64 MB buffer (as above)<br>
 Fill time = 64/(10 x 4 - 10) = 64/30 = slightly over 2 seconds.</p>

<p>But get files size down to 5 MB and things may change<br>
Fill time = 64 / (5 x 4 - 10) = 6.4 seconds. </p>

Do all or most professional photographers do that? Or they just do a simple cropping and adjusting a brightness and contrast compare to those doing like removing an object from a picture to make it perfect, etc.?</p>
","<p>Like John, I can't really speak for pros either. I think it really depends on the person, as some people like to do post-processing, and others are real sticklers about doing everything in camera, with minimal (if any) post processing. </p>

<p>A couple landscape photographers I like span the range. <a href=""https://www.josephholmes.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Joseph Holmes</a> is a great photographer who doesn't seem to do much in the way of post processing. A lot of his work is film, but is more recent stuff is digital. All of it looks pretty much the same (an amazing feat in and of itself to keep your digital work and film work similar.)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.marcadamus.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marc Adamas</a> is widely considered one of the greatest landscape photographers of our time. It is quite clear from his work that he does some fairly ample post processing of his images, which these days are all digital. His work is excellent, and particularly saturated and vibrant. Some of his works are compositions of a few shots (such as his image of a high mountain river with the milky way in the background.</p>

<p>In my own work, I've gone through a couple phases. For about 6-8 months after I first started photography, I did some pretty heavy post processing. I would spend hours fine tuning each pick, even more hours trying to use HDR to create ""better"" photographs, etc. My tactics have changed entirely in my more recent work. I have switched to putting more time into each shot, making sure I am using the correct lens (often taking the same shot with a variety of lenses and focal lengths), making sure I have exactly the correct exposure (resorting to graduated ND filtration rather than HDR when a scene escapes the bounds of my cameras dynamic range), using live view and treating my camera like a large-format view camera to get precise composition and perfect focus, etc. My latest work requires FAR less post processing, and is notably better than my early work where I relied more heavily on post processing. Where I could spend days working an HDR image and its tone mapping to get an ok result, graduated neutral density filters eliminate the need, and produce more pleasing results strait out of the camera. I spend maybe 5 minutes or so figuring out what filtration to use, and getting it placed in front of my lens. Ultimately, I am more satisfied when I put the time in out in the field to work the scene, find my vantage point, and meticulously prepare and take my photographs. I also enjoy having more time on my hands at home since I am not spending hours working my images just to get them to look ""decent"". I can now put that time into making them look like ""mine""...a stylized, artistic signature of who I am and how I see the world. </p>

<p>A simple rule of thumb is, outside of basic exposure control and white balance, if you didn't get it right in camera, you generally can't fix it post-process. If your focus is off, if you blow out your highlights or block your shadows (or both in very high contrast scenes), if you didn't compose the scene properly, if you didn't even capture the most interesting scene (i.e. try different focal lengths), then there is little or nothing you can do in post processing to fix it. Basically, post-processing isn't a replacement for good camera work, although it <strong>can</strong> often <em>enhance</em> good camera work.</p>

<p>That said, some things can't be done in camera. A lot of stylistic, personal trait, or artistic elements of a photograph can only be done during post processing. While certainly no replacement for getting proper composition and framing, focus, dof, etc. in camera, you have a lot of artistic freedom when working with your images on a computer. The possibilities are almost limitless, from simply pushing saturation to the limit like Marc Adamas, to moderate image cleanup that removes unwanted elements from an image (i.e. using Photoshop CS5 Content-Aware fill to remove unwanted or unexpected ugly objects from an otherwise great photo), to complex photomanipulation that takes elements of one or more photographs (and possibly artificial elements), and blends them together to make something entirely new and unique. </p>

<p>Post-processing is ultimately a personal choice, and a fundamental element of ones personal style. You can choose to put all your effort into capturing the perfect picture strait out of the camera, or you can put some effort into turning what you capture with the camera into a unique, stylistic work of artistic perfection that is readily and clearly recognized as ""your"" work. Neither is the ""correct"" way, neither is the ""best"" way, any route you take is simply a part of your personal style, a factor of your work.</p>

<p>This is back from when film cameras were used. To cover the negatives whilst the next frame was 'wound on', a disc would spin, blocking the light as the negative moved. When the negative was in place, this disc would spin open again. Wikipedia has a good animation of this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moviecam_schematic_animation.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The amount of covering the disc provides and the framerate give this 180 degrees that is as close as you get to a 'standard' in filmmaking. For further reading on this (or a better explanation!) I'd suggest looking <a href=""http://blog.tylerginter.com/?p=385"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">over here</a>.</p>

<p>As for a specific recommendation of shutter speed, it depends on the look you want. For example, some action films (using these as an example because they have lots of movement within the frame) will use a very fast <strong>shutter speed</strong> for sharp images, but being professional films they are still shooting at a <strong>framerate</strong> (or 23.976). Others will use the slowest they can get away with, and this will give them lots of motion blur within the shot. A good film that shows examples of both of these is <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Bourne Identity</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR - It's a creative decision.</p>

<p>As for the problem with your F-stops, this is (unfortunately, because you have some real nice lenses) just something you're going to have to live with. Consider whether a slow shutter speed is absolutely necessary for these scenes. Using a faster one could allow you to use your f1.8. Also, depending on the camera you're shooting on, sometimes setting it to 'Auto ISO' can actually let the camera reduce the ISO below the minimum (100, normally) using some metadata hacks or something. (This may just be for stills, though!)</p>

"Why does my aperture setting change as I zoom on my DSLR kit lens?","17066","","<p>I am new to the photography field, there are few things which I am not able to understand. I am playing around with my Nikon D90 along with its kit lens (18-105mm).</p>

<p>While reading about Depth of preview, the author asks to do some basic exercise to better understand DOF, like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>set your aperture to smallest number f/2.8, f/3.5, f/4 with 70mm or longer lens.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I tried to set aperture to f/3.5, and tried to change focal length, my camera is setting aperture automatically in every possible mode (which I know of). It is changing aperture in the following fashion:</p>

<pre><code>1. 18-24 ----&gt; 3.4 to 4
2. 18-35 ----&gt; 4.5
3. 18-50 ----&gt; 5
4. 18-105 ---&gt; 5.6
</code></pre>

<p>But if i set my aperture to 5.6 or higher, it does not change when I change the focal length of my camera. I know I am not doing some basic thing right, but I'm still not sure why this is happening. Can some one help me to understand this?</p>
","<p>It is happening because <strong>you have a variable aperture zoom lens</strong>. The solution is to get a quality lens, otherwise you have to live with the limitations which are actually marked on the barrel of your lens.</p>

<p>It says 18-105mm 1 : 3.5 - 5.6G which means your maximum aperture is F/3.5 at the widest focal-length (18mm) and F/5.6 at the longest (105mm). It changes in increments between that. So, if you are set to F/5.6 then you can zoom with whole focal-length without aperture changing. If you set your aperture to F/3.5 then after a short increase in focal-length, the lens has to diminish its aperture.</p>

"How to have colors in Milky-way?","17038","","<p>Many photos of Milky-way show it in nice colors instead of just the black of sky and white of the stars. Is the key to having those colors in the capturing of the image or in the post processing, or both? Or am I just doing it in a wrong time of year when the visible part of Milky-way is simply not showing color?</p>

<p>Here is a sample photo of how Milky-way looks like in Finland in September:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQw7P.jpg"" alt=""image""></p>

<p>APS-C sensor camera, 18 mm, 30 sec, f/3.5, ISO 3200 - captured in pitch-black darkness of Finnish countryside, far far away from any citylights, at time when moon was still below visible horizon.</p>

<p>What I'd like to achieve is something like the photo in Vivek's answer to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/37261/how-do-i-capture-the-milky-way"">How do I capture the Milky-way?</a></p>

<p>I've just bought a wireless shutter release for longer bulb exposures, and have plans to build a barn-door tracking mount. But is longer exposure the needed trick, or what is?</p>
","<p>The vast majority of night sky photos have been boosted in post to achieve their brightness. This is more true for cameras with smaller sensors than for cameras with larger sensors, but in general, even if you shoot the night sky at ISO 3200, you are going to need to boost exposure to get one of those nice, bright single-frame Milky Way shots.</p>

<p>There are a few things you can do to increase the brightness of your night sky shots. </p>

<p><strong>First and foremost</strong>, don't be afraid to push ISO. I own a Canon 7D, not particularly great at high ISO, and I usually use ISO 1600 and 3200 for my night skies. If you are using ISO 100, 200, or 400, your too low (unless you are also using an f/1.4 or faster lens, and even then, I would still recommend using ISO 1600 at least!)</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, <em>find the darkest skies you possibly can</em>. This can often be difficult, especially in densely populated areas. As an example, almost the entire eastern half of the United States is riddled with <strong><em>light pollution</em></strong>, as can be seen by this view of <strong><a href=""http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/index.php?lat=41.83682786072714&amp;lng=-93.80126953125&amp;zoom=6&amp;pollution=true&amp;selected_id=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dark Sky Finder</a></strong>. On this map, blue and green are acceptable for night sky photography, but still prone to issues with light pollution. In my milky way shot here, I was 50 miles from Denver, in a blue zone, and I still had considerable problems with the metro area light bubble over the horizon (note, this image is heavily processed, original below):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQ3TB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The darker the skies, the brighter night sky objects can be made (key point here...""made""...there is a post processing component that I'll discuss later.) An additional note here...another key factor in achieving dark skies is finding moonless skies. New moons are the best time, and you usually have several days on either side of a new moon where you basically have no moon at all (it either rises or sets with the sun). Even when the moon is out, so long as you time your trip during a period when the moon is not actually in the sky should be fine. That usually means later (i.e. some time after midnight) for waxing moons, and earlier for waning moons. Around full moon, night sky photography is usually out, unless you want the moon to be involved for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, <em>use the longest exposure you can</em>. In the past, this has largely been guided by the 600 Rule, which says divide 600 by the effective focal length of the lens to determine the longest exposure that will not produce star trailing. Today, with ever smaller pixels, the <strong>500 Rule</strong> seems more effective. Here is a table for some common wide-field focal lengths:</p>

<pre><code> Focal Length |   FF   | APS-C (1.5x) | APS-C (1.6x) 
=====================================================
    10mm      |   --   |     33s      |     31s
    14mm      |   35s  |     23s      |     22s
    16mm      |   31s  |     21s      |     19s
    18mm      |   27s  |     18s      |     17s
    24mm      |   20s  |     14s      |     13s
    35mm      |   14s  |     10s      |      9s
    50mm      |   10s  |      6s      |      6s
</code></pre>

<p>In general, wider lenses allow longer exposures, as the angular movement of the sky covers a smaller portion of a wider frame for any given unit time. On APS-C, a 10mm lens will offer the longest exposure time, while on FF a 14/16mm lens will offer the longest exposure time. (Note that 16mm on FF is the same as 10mm on APS-C, so the option of a 14mm lens on FF is an added benefit.) Also don't rule out fish-eye lenses, which offer a full 180° field of view, and therefor an even longer potential exposure time, albeit with a warped projection. It should also be noted that, while a 50mm lens in the table above allows only a very short exposure, it is also often possible to get a 50mm lens with a one-stop, sometimes an even two-stop advantage over other lenses. The 50mm f/1.8 lens is usually the cheapest lens in a lineup, and finding a 50mm f/1.4 lens is often not that hard. That is like exposing for one or two stops longer with any other lens, so the short exposure time is often still workable with a 50mm lens.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the 500/600 Rule assumes identical output magnification. With night sky photography, that is a pretty good assumption, but not necessarily always true. If you intend to crop for any reason (i.e. to blow up a nebula or galaxy), you should be applying your additional crop factor as well. Using a longer focal length is usually a better alternative, however longer focal lengths quickly run into exposure length issues anyway without further measures.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, if you have the option, get a camera with the biggest pixels and lowest high-ISO read noise you can get your hands on. Technically speaking, the Canon 1D X would be the best astrophotography camera on the market today. The Canon 5D III is a far more accessible alternative, and still offers pixels considerably larger than any APS-C part on the market. Larger pixels not only increase the amount of exposure time you have before star trails start occurring, but they gather more light in total during that time as well, so its a double benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, photograph on nights that have good seeing, low atmospheric distortion, etc. The amount of stellar light that reaches an itty bitty camera on the surface of the earth is often dictated by how much of that light is scattered by the atmosphere. Even outside of urban light pollution bubbles, skies full of dust or moisture will warp and scatter a lot of the light reaching the atmosphere. The clearer and crisper the skies, the better your exposure will be. There are various sites on the internet that can probably help you find clear, dark skies with good seeing.</p>

<p>Finally, remember to post process. Even an ISO 3200 shot under decently dark skies is going to be fairly dim at the maximum 500 Rule exposure time. A sky devoid of dust or significant moisture, with good seeing, will produce some beautiful exposures. Mountainous regions, particularly above 11,000 feet, offer this kind of sky in spades, however are less accessible. For any other area, including blue areas on the <a href=""http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/index.php?lat=41.83682786072714&amp;lng=-93.80126953125&amp;zoom=6&amp;pollution=true&amp;selected_id=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dark Sky Finder</a> site, your night sky photos will require some exposure boost and tone mapping in post to fully bring out the detail you are looking for. As an example of how extreme edits may need to be, here is the original version of my shot above...still riddled with light pollution from a city fifty miles away:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DroDN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Despite the sky clarity problems, you can bring out a lot of detail and color with some processing. You will usually end up with very bright stars, which can be a bit unappealing, and the only way to really fix that is to find darker skies.</p>

<p>One final option, for those who have the money, is to get a tracking mount. Good telescopes usually come with an equatorial tracking mount which will nicely track with the sky. This is only really an option if you are just photographing the sky...any included landscape/foreground will blur as the camera tracks. If you buy a tracking mount or better yet a decent telescope, that opens the door to <strong>deep sky astrophotography</strong>, which is complimentary to the kind of <strong>wide-field astrophotography</strong> I've discussed so far. </p>

"What are the advantages or disadvantages of a back illuminated CMOS sensor?","16978","","<p>The <a href=""http://www.apple.com/iphone/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iPhone 4s</a> uses a backlit CMOS sensor, and I have noticed that some other point and shoot cameras do as well. What does that mean for photography, and if it is a benefit why do DSLR cameras not use it?</p>

<p>Also terms I found: Backlit, Back-illuminated, Backside illumination, BSI, BI</p>
","<p>Normally in the manufacture of a camera sensor the photosensitive ""pixels"" are formed on top of a silicon wafer, onto which several layers of circuitry are added to facilitate reading out the pixel values. This circuitry blocks some of the incident light from hitting the photosensitive areas, reducing sensitivity of the sensor (thereby requiring more amplification, which increases noise).</p>

<p>BSI sensors are created in the same way, but the silicon wafer is flipped over and ground down to make it thin enough for light to shine through from the other side. The readout circuitry no longer gets in the way and allows the sensor to capture up to twice as much light.</p>

<p>There are problems associated with this technique: mounting the circuitry that way increases cross-talk, whereby signals on different lines interfere with each other - this can cause pixels to bleed into each other.</p>

<p>The only commercial BSI sensors to date are very small units, cell phone and compact sizes. The technology is regarded by some as a bit of a marketing gimmick, not really producing the claimed benefits. This is principally due to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Efficiency is more important with smaller sensors as their smaller pixels capture less light to begin with.</p></li>
<li><p>Gains from moving the wiring to the back are apparently greatest when the pixel sizes hit around 1.1 microns (such as the case with the 8MP iPhone sensor). For larger pixels the losses due to the wiring are not as great (as there's more space for the wires).</p></li>
<li><p>Having the metalisation layer on the front also causes diffraction effects which are significant as the pixels are only a couple of times the wavelength of light.</p></li>
<li><p>The manufacturing processes is more difficult, reducing yield, making it costly to scale up the design.</p></li>
<li><p>BSI sensors are mechanically much weaker due to the wafer thinning, a large BSI sensor would be very prone to breakage.</p></li>

<li>If you have faster films, ask to have them hand-inspected. With anything ISO 400 and below you should be fine but you can have issues if they go through the scanner too many times or decide to blast your bag with more juice because all your big metal cameras look suspicious.</li>
<li>If you're going to have them hand-inspected, put all your film in a zip-loc bag, and put that on an outside pocket or something so you can yank it out easily (i.e., like your 3oz bottles of liquid).</li>

"Difference between Minolta MC and MD mounts and can they be used on AF camera?","16938","","<p>I am looking at some older lenses for sale.  There are a lot of Minolta MC and MD mount lenses out there.  Can they be used on an AF mount body at all (as a fully manual lens)?  Will either of the MC or MD lenses have any automatic features (aperture, focus, etc)?  I am looking to update a 1990's era Minolta film camera, so it is not clear whether these older lenses will work or not.</p>

<p>I see from this question, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8297/using-slr-lenses-on-dslr-cameras"">Using SLR Lenses on DSLR Cameras</a>, that it appears that older lenses do not work with the AF mounts?  Will they not fit at all?</p>
","<p>Minolta MD/MC (like Canon FD/FL) are not usable on dSLR/dSLT bodies without an adapter with an optical element in it to act like a short teleconverter so you can achieve focus to infinity. And a cheap one will be likely to have cheap glass, and can reduce image quality. A simple ring adapter will limit the focus capability of the lens to less than infinity, and could be useful for a macro or portrait lens.  But overall, adapting MD/MC to dSLR/dSLT bodies is problematic.</p>

<p>The reason is because the distance the lens has to be held from the image plane is specific to the mount system and for achieving the full focus range.  Holding the lens farther out from the body is like using a macro extension tube.  MD/MC's ""registration distance"" is shallower than all the dSLR/dSLT mounts that are current.  And an adapter ring adds distance.  It's easy to adapter a deeper mount to a shallower one, but adapting a shallower one to a deeper one requires shaving some distance off the camera mount or the back of the lens mount.  It can be done, but it's not for the faint of heart. The only easy MD/MC adaption to dSLR that I know of is getting a Rokkor 58mm f/1.2 onto Canon EOS with a <a href=""http://www.leitax.com/Rokkor-lens-for-Canon-cameras.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leitax lens mount replacement kit</a>.</p>

<p>Mirrorless cameras, however, have much shallower registration distances than dSLR/dSLT mounts. So all the mirrorless mounts: micro four-thirds, Sony E, Fuji X, etc. can use simple ring adapters with Minolta MD/MC lenses. But be aware that the crop factor is liable to cause a few issues, here.  MD/MC are manual focus film lenses, so it's unlikely you'll find anything wider than 28mm at affordable prices.  And on a 1.5x or 2x crop sensor, 28mm isn't particularly wide any more. There's also the fact that mirrorless cameras tend to be small, and SLR lenses can be large. Many mirrorless adapters tend to prefer rangefinder glass--if they can find/afford it. </p>

<p>You also, of course, lose autofocus, aperture control from the body (i.e., you can only shoot in full manual or aperture priority modes), and EXIF information from the lens, since these lenses have no electronic communication to speak of. </p>

","<p>Technique is typically at fault with ""fuzzy"" images 99% of the time with someone new to dSLRs with only an 18-55 kit lens.</p>

<p>The lens is <em>not</em> the problem. 18-55s are limited, and they are cheap, and there are much nicer lenses around, but <em>how</em> you use one is more likely to be the fault than what glass is in the lens.  People will often blame the lens because they assume basic mastery of technique, or because that's simply easier than questioning whether it might be a lack of knowledge/expertise, and because there are so many online discussions where people denigrate the lowly kit lens.  But kit lenses are surprisingly good&mdash;especially for the cost&mdash;if you know how to use them. All you have to do is look at <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/challenges/Challenge.aspx?ID=2025"" rel=""noreferrer"">any Kit Lens challenge</a> to see this.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of issues you need to resolve, as any or all of them could be involved in your images.</p>

<h2>Handholding Technique</h2>

<p>Nine times out of ten when I see someone shooting with a dSLR, they're not <a href=""http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-hold-a-digital-camera/"" rel=""noreferrer"">holding it correctly</a>.  If your left hand is cupped around the left side of the lens, pinkie closest to your subject, you're doing it wrong. You want your left hand cupped <em>under</em> the lens/body, palm up, with your pinkie closer to you. You can still operate any lens rings with your thumb and forefinger in this position. And now your left hand is braced to support all the camera/lens weight, rather than having the camera torquing against your right hand. This is a far more stable hold that allows you to use slower shutter speeds. </p>

<h2>Aperture Extremes</h2>

<p>Aperture is a balancing act. On the one hand, the wider the lens is open, the more light you get, and the lower your ISO setting and the faster your shutter speed can be. However, any lens used wide open is at its weakest point. Most lenses perform markedly better stopped down 1-2 stops from wide open (the EF 50mm f/1.8 II is especially guilty of this). Chromatic aberration, vignetting, and softness can all be improved simply by not using the lens at its maximum aperture. A ton of your shots with the 18-55 are @55mm, f/5.6. Stop it down to f/8, and you'll see a bit more sharpness.  And using too small an aperture&mdash;especially with today's pixel densities&mdash;can see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8304/what-is-a-diffraction-limit"">diffraction</a> making things softer, too.  So, probably not good to use apertures smaller than f/16 unless you've got a good reason to. </p>

<p>Also, not shooting wide open gives you more depth of field, which in turn gives you more leeway with the autofocus accuracy. A 50mm f/1.8 II at some subject distances, if wide open, yields a DoF that can be measured in millimeters. Any slight movement of the subject or camera could throw the focus off. Trading off some background blur for better focus is often worth it.</p>

<h2>Misfocus</h2>

<p>This isn't actually as common a cause of fuzziness as most people assume; the first assumption most beginners make whenever something's fuzzy is that it's a focus issue. But when you let the camera's autofocus system take over, the problem is that the camera isn't smart enough to know what the subject of the image is, and direct the focus there. Learning the different autofocus modes, how to select autofocus points, and how to half-press and recompose are your weapons, here.</p>

<p>If it's an issue of misfocus, check the rest of the frame to see if anything else was in focus. With your wave shots, you'll notice that sections of the waves are crisp and in perfect focus, while other parts outside of your depth of field are not. If you'd stopped down to a smaller aperture (say, f/11), more of the wave would have been in focus.</p>

<p>Also, don't expect miracles in low light. Cameras need more light to ""see"" by than your eyes do. It's normal for autofocus systems to hunt in dark conditions. Your flash can send out more light for focus assisting, or you can use liveview and 10x magnification (if your camera's on a tripod) with manual focus when the autofocus fails you. Pay attention to the autofocus confirmation ""green dot"" in the viewfinder.</p>

<h2>Minimum Focus Distance</h2>

<p>If you came from the P&amp;S world, you're probably unaware that most lenses can only focus so close (this is why macro lenses exist).  Small P&amp;S sensors mean equally smaller lenses, with very short focal lengths which equates to very large DoF, and very good near-focusing capabilities. When you jump up to an APS-C sensor, and your lenses get commensurately bigger, so does this minimum focus distance. The 18-55 cannot focus on anything closer than the 25cm. Your fuzzy close-up portrait demonstrates this.  You'd need a macro lens, or the poor-man's macro methods (close-up filter, extension tubes, reversed lens) to shoot closer.</p>

<h2>Shutter Speed Too Slow</h2>

<p>Shutter speed can affect you more if you're using a longer lens, but even with IS, there's still a lower limit, and this assumes that you have good handholding technique to begin with. If you're shooting single-handed, if you don't know how to brace your feet or time your breathing, you'll need a higher shutter speed. 1/30s is a typical threshhold, and there's a rule of thumb about 1/focal_length or faster. Some folks would multiply that by 2, or throw in the crop factor as well. @55mm, that would mean using a shutter speed around 1/100s or faster. And that's with a stationary subject. With a moving subject, to ""freeze"" the motion and avoid blur, you may need an even higher shutter speed, and how high depends on how quickly your subject is moving.</p>

<p>Consider using physical stabilization as well for very slow shutter speeds: a tripod, monopod, or beanbag can make a big difference.  Also, for macro shooting, everything is magnified--camera shake or subject motion included. 1/focal_length might not cut it the closer you get.</p>

<h2>Postprocessing &amp; Pixel Peeping</h2>

<p>Don't pixel peep to judge sharpness, unless you're a lens tester :). Look at the image overall.  Asking for ideal razor-sharp perfection on every pixel in any image is a big big ask. Very few lenses are up to that task, and certainly not an 18-55 kit lens used wide open with bad technique.</p>

<p>Also be aware that P&amp;S cameras and most photographers enhance the sharpness/contrast/saturation of an image through processing. Don't expect straight-out-of-camera JPEGS&mdash;unless you've asked the camera to add these things&mdash;to look as sharp/contrasty/saturated as images around the web that were shot RAW and post-processed with care and skill.</p>

"What causes banding noise?","16769","","<p>I'm looking for information (and references) on three related topics:</p>

<p>What causes <a href=""http://www.topazlabs.com/denoise/_images/eyebanding1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">banding noise</a> in CMOS sensors?  What is the physical/technological cause?  Is the cause the same in CCD and CMOS sensors?</p>

<p>How do the various relevant factors (ISO setting, exposure time, and exposure level) influence the banding strength and pattern?</p>

<p>Is the band pattern stable in the short term (sequential shots) and in the long term?  Is there a chance the band pattern of an actual sensor could be measured and used to reduce the effect in actual photos?</p>

<hr>

<p>To clarify what I mean by banding, here's an example image from the TopazLabs website.  Notice the horizontal bands in the noisy image.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ejsCx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>A naive experiment didn't show any positive correlation between the banding in several images of a plain white surface.</p>
","<p>Horizontal and Vertical Banding Noise (HVBN) is caused by sensor readout, downstream amplification, and ADC. There can be multiple sources of HVBN, some of them cause a relatively fixed pattern, others can cause random pattern. External signal interference is often a source of softer and more random banding. Exactly which causes banding in which sensors really depends, and no one but the manufacturer has enough information to point to the exact causes for any given camera.</p>

<p>Primarily, HVBN is caused by the way rows of pixels are activated, and each column for a row is read, and the nature of the transistors involved in that readout process. First, transistors manufactured via photolithography are imperfect. Imperfections in the base silicon, imperfections in the template and etching, etc. can all affect the response of transistors. As such, each pixel in a sensor, as well as buckets for on-die image processing such as CDS (Correlated Double Sampling), will not necessarily behave like all the rest, producing differences. In modern CMOS sensors (Sony Exmor type sensors excluded), on-die CDS circuitry is often a culprit for introducing banding noise at lower ISO settings (ISO 100 through maybe 800) in the deep shadows.</p>

<p>Some readout designs also involve an additional downstream amplifier used in certain circumstances, used in addition to the per-pixel amplifiers. Banding noise introduced within the sensor die itself will be exacerbated by any downstream amplifier. These kinds of amplifiers usually kick in at really high ISO, such as 6400 and higher, which is why relatively ""clean"" output at ISO 1600 and maybe 3200 suddenly becomes much worse at even higher settings.</p>

<p>Another source of banding is the ADC. There are potentially two culprits here. In the case of a camera like the 7D, which uses split parallel readout (where four readout channels are directed to one DIGIC 4 chip and another four are directed to another DIGIC 4 chip in an interleaved fashion), a fairly pronounced but even vertical banding can occur, even in the midtones, thanks to different response of the DIGIC DSP image processors that house four ADC units each. As even bands are sent to one DIGIC's ADC units, and odd bands are sent to the other DICIC's ADC units, 100% identical processing is unlikely, and slight differences manifest as vertical bands.</p>

<p>The final potential source is high frequency components. High frequency logic has a tendency to be noisy. Using the 7D again as an example, it is an 18 megapixel sensor, which a grand total of eight ADC units must process, at a speed fast enough to support an 8fps shutter rate. (Technically speaking, the 7D has even more than 18 million pixels...it is actually a 19.1 megapixel sensor, as Canon always masks off a border of pixels for bias offset and black point calibration.) At 8fps, total pixels processed per second must be at least 152,800,000, and since there are eight ADC units, each unit must process 19.1 million pixels each and every second. That requires a higher frequency, which can (via a variety of mechanisms I won't go into here) introduce additional noise.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are ways HVBN can be reduced. Some sensor designs clip negative signal values from pixels (or, in other words, do not use a bias offset), which has the effect of halving banding, but also costing some potentially recoverable detail deep within the shadows of the image. Sensors that do use a bias offset (which allows negative signal values up to a preset level) tend to have more HVBN at lower ISO as less clipping is performed in order to support a larger full-well capacity. More advanced ADC design can reduce noise, some even utilize noise along with a form of dithering to nearly eliminate ADC introduced noise.</p>

<p>Another way banding noise can be reduced is by moving the analog signal to digital earlier, preferably on the sensor die itself. Digital data can be error corrected during transfer, where as analog signals tend to pick up noise the more they travel along electronic busses and through processing units. An increase in the number of ADC units improves parallelism, reducing the speed each unit must operate at, therefor allowing lower frequency components to be used. Better manufacturing techniques (usually afforded by a smaller fabrication process, which increases the room for more complex hardware) as well as better silicon wafers can be used to normalize the response curve for each transistor or logic unit, allowing them to produce cleaner results, even at higher frequencies.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sony Exmor, the well-known nearly noise-free sensor in Nikon's D800 and D600 cameras, took a fairly radical approach to reducing the most intrusive and frustrating form of noise. Exmor moves the entire image processing pipeline up to and including the ADC onto the sensor die. It hyperparallelized the ADC, adding one per pixel column (CP-ADC, or column-parallel ADC). It eliminated analog per-pixel amplification and analog CDS in favor of digital amplification and digital CDS. It isolated high frequency components in a remote area of the sensor die, which nearly eliminated noise introduced by each ADC unit themselves. Pixel read results in immediate conversion from an analog charge into a digital unit, and it remain digital from that point on. Once digital, all information transfer is effectively noise free, as data transmission can be error corrected, thus guaranteeing proper transmission through buses and downstream image processors. </p>

<p>One of the big wins for Exmor (according to Sony) was the elimination of analog CDS circuitry, and a move to digital CDS logic. Sony's claim was that the differences in response for analog CDS units were a source of banding noise. Instead of storing the reset charge of each pixel as a charge, a ""reset read"" is performed, that reset read is run through the same ADC process as a normal image read with the exception that the digital output is tracked as negative values. When the actual exposure is read, it is read out as positive values, and the prior ""negative"" CDS read is applied inline (i.e. each pixel read out starts at some negative value, and counting increases from there). This eliminates noise both from non-uniform transistor response as well as from dark current simultaneously.</p>

<p>With an Exmor sensor, readout is effectively ISO-less (you may have heard that term elsewhere on the net). All ISO settings are achieved via a simple digital boost (digital amplification) to the appropriate level. For RAW, the ISO setting simply needs to be stored as metadata, and RAW editors boost each pixel value to the appropriate level during demosaicing. This is why an ISO 100 D800 shot can be underexposed, then lifted in post by many stops, without introducing banding noise in the shadows.</p>

"Why is this child portrait not compelling? What went wrong and what could have been done better?","16756","","<p>I am new to photography. I want to improve my pics, so I need some input from you all.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1A2OH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1A2OH.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>Please look at this pic and guide me on what went wrong. How could I have improved this picture? I edited this pic in Photoshop to pop the colors. </p>
","<p>The first and obvious problem is framing.  Almost never do you want to put a small head in the middle of a large picture.</p>

<p>There is much space to the left of the child in the picture, but it doesn't add anything (in my opinion).</p>

<p>My first instinct would have been to use vertical format, probably capturing a little above and below the child, then deciding in post-processing what I really want to keep.  I really don't see the point to why you left a lot of room above the child's head, but clipped off part of her feet.</p>

<p>Going with the clipped feet, here is a possible treatment:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CpT0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CpT0.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>The main point is the child and the look on her face.  The toys add context, but we don't need to see all of them for that.</p>

<p>Something about the color still looks weird to me.  I suspect a slight pink cast, but I wasn't there so don't really know.  Here it is with the background part of her shirt made white:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7wMV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7wMV.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>That looks a little more plausible to me, but again, I don't know what color the shirt really was.</p>

<p>The white parts seem just a little blown out.  That can probably be fixed by going back to the raw image.</p>

<p>I can certainly believe you saturated the colors.  That's more a matter of taste and what you want to show, but probably does help somewhat with this picture.  The contrast seems a little too high, as evidenced by the slightly blown highlights and something just not looking right around the edges of the child's face.  However, now we're getting into personal preference and artistic expression, where there is no right or wrong.  I may also think differently after seeing some alternatives.</p>

"Will an SSD provide a noticeable benefit for Lightroom over a traditional harddrive?","16707","","<p>I am a huge Lightroom (3.6) user, and have a 2006 2.15 Ghz Core 2 Duo 24"" iMac, running Lion.  This Mac it limited to 3GB RAM max, but does have dedicated graphics. I have about 50GB left on my harddrive. I have over 21,000 images in my LR catalog. The catalog itself is local on my iMac hard drive, but images are on attached storage.</p>

<p>My issue is that I have been having some noticeable performance issues with Lightroom. Dragging sliders can be jumpy at times, and sometimes switching modules has significant delays. I suspect that overhead in Lion is somewhat to blame, but it may also be all the files and apps on my Mac.</p>

<p>So, question is:  does anyone have tested evidence of an SSD vs harddrive on Lightroom performance?  How dependent is Mac OSX on free hard drive space when it pages to virtual memory? How much free space is preferred? </p>

<p>Or is my issue more related to LR itself, in that I have over 21,000 images in my LR catalog? Would I see noticeable improvement in the interface with a smaller catalog?</p>

<p>Trying to decide if the pain of opening my iMac and installing an SSD is worth it, or if I should instead save the $$ and put it toward an updated iMac in the future.</p>
","<p>I recently got an SSD drive for my primary boot drive. It was a moderately fast one, with consistent 270mb/s read and write speeds. I've used lightroom with the catalog both on the SSD and on a normal HDD, and I did not see a whole lot of performance improvement for my catalog, which is about 12,000 photos or so.</p>

<p>As I started investigating how to improve the performance of Lightroom, I realized that the most significant factor that affected performance was the Camera RAW Cache size (Preferences -> File Handling -> Camera Raw Cache Settings -> Maximum Size). It defaults to 1Gb, however when working with a large number of RAW photos, a 1Gb cache is FAR, FAR too small. Increasing it to at least 20Gb offered good improvement, and increasing it to 50Gb offered considerable improvement. The improvement was a bit better on the SSD, however given the value of SSD space, I again moved the cache off onto a normal HDD. The performance gains are still evident, and I'm quite happy using LR with all of its data on a normal hard drive.</p>

<p>It should be noted that SSD's come in a very BROAD range of speeds and capabilities. Some are fairly slow relative to an HDD (which can usually offer around 60mb/s burst rates), where as some are insanely fast. SSD burst rates can range from as low as around 100mb/s or even lower for really cheap drives, to as high as 700mb/s or even more for highly specialized designs...such as those that fit into a PCI-E slot. Some SSD's include built-in high-speed secondary caches, some have better data distribution algorithms that optimize read or write speeds, etc. All these factors can affect whether an SSD might show a significant improvement for Lightroom performance or not. Lightroom generally stores the working image in memory, so if you are worried about single-image development speed, an SSD is not going to help much. The performance gains that can be realized from faster storage drive speeds happen when moving between files, performing multi-file operations, etc. The bottom line is...the more money you are willing to spend for better SSD technology and faster burst rate, the more likely you are to see an improvement.</p>

"How can I get sharp manual focus despite poor eyesight?","16682","","<p>I suffer from astigmatism. It's only mild, though I feel it's affecting what I'm seeing when looking through the viewfinder. Frequently, after shooting a photo with my Canon EOS 7D, I'll load it into Lightroom and discover that what looked sharp as an LCD preview is actually not at all in focus when you get down to the 1:1 level.</p>

<p>Is there anything that I can try that could improve my shots, particularly anything that would reduce/nullify the effect of my eyesight while using the camera?

","<p>Pixel peeped images aren't likely to look sharp unless you're viewing from a distance... Something to bear in mind.</p>

The basic idea here is much like a rangefinder camera, the prism splits the image when it is out of focus and when it is brought into focus, the image lines up. This can assist quite a bit, especially with poorer eyesight.</p>

","<p>'End' in this case is just referring to the end of the zoom range available.

"Why is maximum shutter speed fixed on Nikon DSLRs when using flash?","16539","","<p>I recently upgraded from D300 to D800 and I was very excited about the new auto ISO feature that automatically sets the maximum shutter speed based on focal length (including an adjustable multiplier). This is really convenient, especially for zoom lenses where focal length can vary rapidly.</p>

<p>However, it seems like when I attach a flash (SB600) that clever logic goes out the window. The flash shutter speed (option e2), which determines the maximum shutter speed while using flash, is a fixed setting buried in the menus and the smallest possible value is 1/60, which is not fast enough for a long lens. I can switch to Manual and set shutter speed myself, and auto FP (which can be enabled in setting e1) definitely helps since it only switches to high speed sync if I go under the flash sync time. But ideally it'd be nice if flash shutter speed were automatically set based on focal length using the same mechanism as auto ISO. </p>

<p>My main question here is: <s>what is Nikon's motivation for this limitation? And why can't option e2 be set faster than 1/60? Are there other vendors who do something more clever?</s> The final question ended up being more like: what's an efficient way to shoot with flash on Nikon in situations where 1/60 isn't fast enough to freeze motion, e.g. when shooting a closeup with a long lens?</p>
","<p>The maximum sync speed is the speed where the whole sensor is exposed. At higher speeds, the two shutters form a slit as they cross the sensor. But most modern cameras have a max sync speed of 1/250 or so. 1/60 is really slow, I think my 40 year old Nikon F could do that.</p>

<p>When you use a flash, its the light of the flash that stops action/motion. Most flashes are lit only for 1/1000 or shorter. Look at the T.1 time of your flash's specs.</p>

"What is the difference between digital high ISO noise and film grain?","16531","","<p>What is the difference between digital high ISO noise and film grain? Why does one ""eat detail"" and the other does not?</p>
","<p>The size of the grains in the film varies depending on the film sensetivity. The more sensetive the film, the larger the grains. Digital noise is always the size of a pixel, regardless of the ISO setting.</p>

<p>Film grain is color neutral, as it consist mostly of luminance differences. Digital noise consists of both luminance and color differences, and is most visible in the blue color channel.</p>

<p>In the more recent digital cameras the digital noise is quite even, in earlier models the noise had more banding and patterns. The film grain doesn't have any banding or patterns, so it's seen as pure noise. If the digital noise has any banding or pattern, the brain can easily pick that up, and that is more disturbing than pure noise.</p>

<p>Neither grain nor noise eats detail. It's noise reduction that eats detail, as it can't tell the difference between small details and noise. Noise reduction is used on digital noise, but it can also be used to reduce film grain.</p>

<p>On the left is the film grain from a Kodak Gold ISO 200 film, on the right is the digital noise of a Canon EOS 5D mark II @ ISO 3200. Notice the blue noise in the dark areas in the right image.</p>

"What is a ""diffraction limit""?","16505","","<p>I've seen the term used, but what is a ""diffraction limit"", when should I worry about it, and what undesirable effects are a result of it ?</p>
","<p>There have been some very good answers, however there are a couple details that have not been mentioned. First, diffraction always happens, at every aperture, as light bends around the edges of the diaphragm and creates an ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Airy Disk</a>"". The size of the airy disk, and the proportion of the disk that comprises the outer rings, and the amplitude of each wave in the outer rings, increases as the aperture is stopped down (the physical aperture gets smaller.) When you approach photography in the way Whuber mentioned in his answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of a scene as comprised of many
  small discrete points of light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You realize that every one of those points of light, when focused by your lens, is generating its own airy disk on the imaging medium.</p>

<h2>Regarding Image Medium</h2>

<p>It should also be clearly noted that the <strong>diffraction <em>limit</em></strong> is not actually a limitation of a lens. As noted above, lenses are always creating a diffraction pattern, only the degree and extent of that pattern changes as the lens is stopped down. The ""limit"" of diffraction is a function of the imaging medium. A sensor with smaller photosites, or film with smaller grain, will have a lower limit of diffraction than those with larger photosites/grains. This is due to the fact that a smaller photosite covers <em>less of the airy disk area</em> than a larger photosite. When the airy disk grows in size and intensity as a lens is stopped down, the airy disk affects neighboring photosites. </p>

<p>The <em>diffraction limit</em> is the point where airy disks grow large enough that they begin to affect more than a single photosite. Another way to look at it is when the airy disks from two point light sources resolvable by the sensor begin to merge. At a wide aperture, two point light sources imaged by a sensor may only affect single neighboring photosites. When the aperture is stopped down, the airy disk generated by each point light source grows, to the point where the outer rings of each airy disk begin to merge. This is the point where a sensor is ""diffraction limited"", since individual point light sources no longer resolve to a single photosite...they are merging and covering more than one photosite. The point at which the center of each airy disk merges is the limit of resolution, and you will no longer be able to resolve any finer detail regardless of the aperture used. This is the diffraction cutoff frequency.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RxZb.jpg"" alt=""Diffraction Limitations due to Airk Disk merger""></p>

<p>It should be noted that it is possible for a lens to resolve a smaller spot the pixels in an imaging medium. This is the case when airy disks focused by a lens cover only a fraction of a photosite. In this case, even if two highly resolved point light sources generate airy disks that merge over a single photosite, the end result will be the same...the sensor will only detect a single point light regardless of the aperture. The ""diffraction limit"" of such a sensor would be higher (say f/16) than for a sensor that is able to distinctly resolve both point light sources (which might be diffraction limited at f/8). It is also possible, and <em>likely</em> that point light sources will NOT be perfectly focused onto the center of a photosite. It is entirely plausible for an airy disk to be focused at the border between two photosites, or the junction of four photosites. In a black and white sensor or foveon sensor (stacked color sensels), that would only cause softening. In a color bayer sensor, where a square junction of 4 photosites will be capturing an alternating pattern of GRGB colors, as airy disk can affect the final color rendered by those four photosites as well as cause softening or improper resolution.</p>

<p>My Canon 450D, a 12.2mp APS-C sensor, has a diffraction limit of f/8.4. In contrast, the Canon 5D Mark II, a 21.1mp Full Frame sensor, has a diffraction limit of f/10.3. The larger sensor, despite having nearly twice as many megapixels, can go an extra stop before it encounters its diffraction limit. This is because the physical size of the photosites on the 5D II are larger than those on the 450D. (A good example of one of the numerous benefits of larger sensors.)</p>

<p><strong>Wrenches in the mix</strong></p>

<p>You may often come across tables on the internet that specify a specific diffraction limited aperture for specific formats. I often see f/16 used for APS-C sensors, and f/22 for Full Frame. In the digital world, these numbers are generally useless. The diffraction limiting aperture (DLA) is ultimately a function of the relation of the size of a focused point of light (including the airy disk pattern) to the size of a single light sensing element on a sensor. For any given sensor size, APS-C or Full Frame, the diffraction limit will change depending on the size of the photosites. An example of this can be seen with Canon's EOS Rebel line of cameras over the years:</p>

<pre><code>Camera   |   DLA
--------------------
350D     |   f/10.4
400D     |   f/9.3
450D     |   f/8.4
500D     |   f/7.6
550D     |   f/6.8
</code></pre>

<p>The story should be similar for film grain size. Films with finer grain would ultimately be more susceptible to diffraction softening at lower apertures than films with larger grains.</p>

<h2>The Diffraction Cutoff Frequency</h2>

<p>Diffraction is often touted as an image killer, and people talk about the ""diffraction limit"" as the point at which you can no longer resolve an image ""usefully"". On the contrary, the diffraction limit is only the point where diffraction <strong>starts</strong> to affect an image for the particular image medium you are using. The <em>diffraction cutoff frequency</em> is the point at which additional sharpness is impossible for a given aperture, and this is indeed a function of the lens and physical aperture.</p>

<p>The formula for diffraction cutoff frequency for (perfect) optical systems is as follows:</p>

<p>fc = 1 / (λ * f#) cycles/mm</p>

<p>This states that the reciprocal of the wavelength of the light being focused multiplied by the f-number of the lens is the number of cycles per millimeter that can be resolved. The diffraction cutoff frequency is generally the point where resolution reaches the wavelength of the frequencies of light itself. For visible light, λ between 380-750nm, or 0.38-0.75 microns. Until the cutoff frequency has been met for a given aperture, more resolution can be achieved. </p>

<h2>Visual Examples</h2>

<p>Whubers sequence of images above is a decent example of the effect of diffraction, as well as the effect of optical aberrations when the lens is wide open. I think it suffers a bit from some focus shift due to spherical aberration, so I have created an animated GIF that demonstrates the effects of changing the aperture of a Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens down from its widest aperture to its narrowest, in full stops.</p>

<p><img src=""https://jonrista.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/diffraction-sample.gif"" alt=""Diffraction Sequence""></p>

<p>(Note: The image is large, 3.8meg, so let it fully download to see the comparison of sharpness at each stop.) The image exhibits marked optical aberration when shot wide open, particularly Chromatic Aberration and some Spherical Aberration (there may be some slight purple fringing...I tried to get focus dead on.) Stopped down to f/2, CA is lessened considerably. From f/2.8 through f/8, sharpness is at its prime, with f/8 being ideal. At f/11, sharpness drops ever so slightly, due to <em>diffraction</em>. At f/16 and particularly f/22, diffraction visibly affects image sharpness. Note that even with diffraction blurring, f/22 is still considerably sharper than f/1.4 or f/2. </p>

"How do I dry water condensation off my camera?","16487","","<p>OK, I did something very very stupid. I know it. I just wasn't thinking. :(  In a nutshell, I didn't follow the advice here: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/11288/how-do-i-prevent-condensation-on-a-lens-when-outdoors"">How do I prevent condensation on a lens when outdoors?</a></p>

<p>So it's a very hot and humid day here... 95 °F (= 35 °C) and 70% humidity... the heat index is hanging around 110. I'm inside in a well air conditioned building, my camera was sitting in it's bag, very close to the air conditioner (dumb placement, I know) so it is very cold. I just grabbed it and walked out side to get a shot of a bird. The lens fogged up almost immediately. I then realized my stupidity and came back inside. After drying the front element of the lens, and the lcd and the view finder eyepiece, I sighted out a shot and realized it's still fogged, so the internal surfaces are too. :(</p>

<p>How best can I recover from this incident without condensation damage to the camera? (I've already powered it down and pulled the battery.) Should I take the lens off? (this is a 5D2 with an L series lens)</p>
","<p>Cameras handle worse conditions all the time.  Chances are <em>very</em> good you just had condensation on the inside of your lens or on the sensor itself.  Let it be for a few hours and try again.  I wouldn't take the lens off yet, because if the sensor is wet from condensation you'll have a higher chance of having dust adhere to it.  If it isn't clear in a few hours, let the gear sit overnight in normal temperature.</p>

<p>If you end up with an image that is still foggy then, remove your lens and see if you've damaged your lens by having condensation inside the barrel of the lens.  If that's the case, it'll probably be time to replace it unless you happen to be under warranty (and they'll cover it).  </p>

<p>If the lens is clear, or your images seem to have permanent marks on them, you may have gotten dust stuck to your sensor when it was humidified and need to clean it.  I can highly recommend Sensor Swabs by Photographic Solutions.  You'll have to verify which ""type"" your camera sensor needs.  If uncomfortable with this, you may need to visit your local camera service center.</p>

","<p>You can digitally enhance your pictures by increasing the brightness and adjusting the contrast. You can also crop out any parts of the image that don't contribute to the impressive nature of it.</p>

<p>Take advantage of angles to convey attributes such as size and distance. Using perspective can also help liven up your images. I think the main concern is that the mountains look flat. To remedy this, choosing a new position (down off the highway) might help. If you can get the mountains to loom over the structure, it would definitely fix the flat look.</p>

<p>The cloudy backdrop dulls the pictures, so I suggest simply taking photos another day. Wait until it's sunny to consider taking your picture.</p>

<p>Expression is another key concept in photography. You can add flavor to your pictures by taking them in unusual circumstances, such as during a storm or a sunset. Capturing the mood will help increase interest.</p>

While trying to take action shots (e.g. my dog running or sports) none of the shots seem to be in focus even on AF-C mode. Would this be a limitation of my lens, or the body?</p>

<p>I tried to focus from the minimum focus distance to infinity and it took about ~0.5 seconds, so I'm assuming my lens isn't able to keep up with the subject which in motion.</p>

<p>I was wondering what you guys think the issue is and how I would be able to get sharper action shorts while shooting 6fps.</p>
","<p>There are two issues that are probably affecting your results. Your lens is fairly weak in both areas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto Focus speed and accuracy</li>
<li>Camera and/or subject movement</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The size of a lens' maximum aperture affects the camera's Auto Focus performance.</strong> Not only because the AF system has more light to work with when using a lens with a wider aperture, but also because of the physics involved and the use of edge rays by phase detection AF systems. In general, the same camera with a ""faster"" lens (one with a wider maximum aperture) can focus more quickly and more accurately than with a ""slower"" lens. Regardless of what aperture is set in camera, focusing is normally done with the lens wide open. The lens is then stopped down just prior to the shutter opening. Performance of the motor driving the lens' focus elements, including the gearing in the lens, also plays a part.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the D7000's available options, but most DSLRs in this class allow you to customize how the Continuous Servo AF works. Through the custom menus you can tell it whether to place priority on focus speed (at the expense of accuracy) or accuracy (at the expense of speed). When shooting continuous bursts you can usually tell it to prioritize one way for the initial shot and then shift to another priority for the subsequent frames in the burst.</p>

<p><strong>The rule of thumb for preventing blur due to camera shake is to use a shutter speed no slower than 1/equivalent focal length.</strong> In the case of your APS-C D7000, that means 1/1.5 X the focal length used. At the 28mm end you could use a shutter speed as slow as 1/40 sec if you are practicing good camera stabilization techniques when shooting. On the telephoto end you need a shutter speed of 1/300 sec or faster. Image stabilization would help prevent blur due to camera shake, but your lens doesn't have it. In the case of shooting fast moving subjects like your dog, it makes no difference anyway.</p>

<p><strong>To stop motion of fast moving subjects like a dog or athletes in motion you need faster shutter speeds.</strong> Shooting football from the sidelines with a 200mm lens requires about 1/500 sec or faster to freeze the motion. The closer the action is to you, the faster the shutter speed that you need. The only way to get faster shutter speeds in the same amount of light is to either raise the ISO or open the aperture wider. If your aperture is already wide open, then higher ISO is the only way to increase the shutter speed. The problem with higher ISO is that the increased noise (and the effects of using aggressive Noise Reduction) will reduce the amount of detail in the image.</p>

"What is meant by the ""native ISO"" when talking about DSLRs?","16429","","<p>The new Nikon D7000 is out, and a lot of previews has touted the ""native iso"" of D7000 to be 100.</p>

<p>What does this actually mean? I'm assuming it means it performs at its best at iso 100, which means if you're ok to sacrifice light sensitivity, you'll get really great images...?</p>
","<p>As I understand it the ""native"" or ""base"" ISO is the sensitivity you get without amplifying the analogue signal you get from the sensor. It becomes important when the native ISO is higher than the lowest available on a camera (e.g. the base ISO is 140 and the lowest setting is 100). In this case the camera is likely to overexpose the image (as you can't unamplify the signal to recover the highlights) and the non-amplified signal is more likely to be affected by the read noise of the electronics (then read noise of the electronics is roughly constant so if you have a small signal the read noise is higher by comparison).</p>

<p>As already stated it's unlikely to actually be noticeable in images however if you always strive to use the lowest ISO the camera offers whenever possible, you may be wasting your efforts as the image quality may be just as high/slightly better one setting up.</p>

<p>I have seen many posts here with variations of the theme ""point and shoot vs. DSLR"". But none of those answer my question. Is there any P&amp;S (camera or mobile phone) which is comparable or equal to an entry level DSLR such as Nikon D3100 or Canon T3i, in terms of image quality, low light quality, changeability of lenses etc. at a <strong>SIMILAR PRICE</strong> ?

<p>PS: I am trying to select a beginner camera and I am confused.  </p>
","<p>Let us dispose of the term ""point-and-shoot"" for a moment, and replace it with ""fixed-lens"". ""Point-and-shoot"" implies a mass-market snapshot camera, and the class of fixed-lens cameras goes well beyond the mass market into the realm of cameras that would easily wipe the floor with any entry-level DSLR or MILC in their specific use case. But when you get to that level, fixed-lens cameras become very specialized, very expensive, or <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>The Sigma DPx Merrils, for instance, will give you utterly breathtaking image quality at low ISOs, but the cost a thousand dollars apiece, can't really be used above ISO 400 at all, and you need a whole different camera to change focal length. The Fuji X100s is a street-shooter's dream come true, but it's rather expensive and has a single fixed focal length. The Sony RX1 is a full-frame camera you can put in your pocket, but again costly and a fixed focal length.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> get a good compromise between IQ, large-enough sensor, relatively good, fast glass and a large zoom range in a fixed-lens camera (at least one, anyway: the Sony RX10), but you are kissing the entry-level DSLR price range a fond farewell and are stepping up into what can only be described as ""enthusiast"" territory. (And if you want a prestige brand, Leica and Hasselblad will gladly sell you rebranded versions of other cameras at a huge markup.) Other high-IQ fixed-lens cameras tend to have zoom ranges not significantly different from the entry-level DSLR/MILC kits.</p>

<p>The entry-level DLSR or MILC will give you more for less, at the penalty of having to buy a two-lens kit (or an additional lens to go with the standard kit). Yes, the system will be bulkier and have more to fumble with to go from wide-angle to long tele, but there is, in compensation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a considerable cost savings;</p></li>
<li><p>greater possibility for expansion; and</p></li>
<li><p>an easier upgrade path.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of those, the ""considerable cost savings"" is probably most important to <em>present</em> you. You really have no idea what <em>future</em> you may or may not want, and paying more right now for something you might find completely unsuitable in the near future makes little sense (especially since fixed-lens cameras don't hold much in the way of resale value). If you were experienced enough to say with certainty that a particular fixed-lens camera will completely cover your needs, you might be able to justify spending the extra to get the convenience. But as a beginner, you'd be locking yourself into a range of photography that you cannot step out of unless you buy another camera.</p>

<p>That is not to say that there's no value in having something like a small-sensor superzoom/ultrazoom/bridge camera. If you don't particularly need shallow depth of field except in ""macro"" shots, don't expect to work in low light and don't foresee using you images for anything other than screen presentation at reduced sizes or small (8x10 or smaller) prints, there are plenty of cameras out there that fill that niche, each of them more-or-less equivalent to the others, but with minor feature differences. For some value of ""good enough"", they really are good enough; you just need to know what ""good enough"" means to you, and it is very hard for a beginner to know that. It may be the best $500 you ever spent, or it may be $500 down the tubes.</p>

<p>Yes, the Samyang and Rokinon (and Vivitar, Pro-Optic, Opteka, Bower, Phoenix, Walimex, etc. etc.) are the same lens, and are optically identical, although not identical in outward appearance. However, Samyang's lenses are manual-only and do not perform electronic communication with the camera body. You have to manually focus, and manually set the aperture with the lens's aperture ring. You can only use M/Av modes because the camera body can't control the aperture. You have to use stop-down metering (i.e., the view through the viewfinder goes darker the more you stop down). The EXIF won't have any lens information (aperture used, lens name, etc.) in it. What you save in dollars, you will pay back in inconvenience vs. a lens that can communicate with your camera body.</p>

<p>You also won't have much luck in getting a lens that's <em>ultrawide</em> on both crop and full-frame because of the crop factor.  While 14mm is ultrawide on full frame, it's the full-frame equivalent of a 21mm lens on a crop body.  This is the single category of lenses where you would probably be much better off getting a crop lens, and then reselling it when you move to full-frame, because none of the ultrawide offerings for full frame are ultrawide on a crop (ok, <em>maybe</em> the Sigma 12-24), none of the crop ultrawides cover a full-frame sensor even if they still mount, and the crop versions cost quite a bit less.</p>

<p>The Tokina 11-16, btw, is a crop lens and will vignette on full frame up to about 15mm. That's why Tokina also makes the 16-28/2.8 for full frame.</p>

<p>This folder was always empty and the camera didn't bother if I deleted it.</p>

<p><strong>What's the point of this folder?</strong></p>
","<p>Its for non-image data that may be used by the camera when processing, storage for user settings (i.e. 1D series...maybe 5D as well), and from what I've heard, storage of temporary audio streams when recording video. Its kind of a catch-all folder that stores anything that doesn't belong in the DCIM folder, and I think most (if not all) of it is temporary data.</p>

<hr>

<p>Due to curiosity, I searched a little more research about canon folder structure. It seems like there is a fair amount of information that can be stored on a memory card by modern Canon cameras such as the 5D Mark II and 1D/s Mark III series. There is obviously the DCIM folder, however unique to Canon, you may also find a CANONMISC folder within the DCIM folder. This contains canon- and camera-specific information that allows the camera to manage the DCIM folder...such as thumbnail metadata for images saved in the camera-specific or stream-specific folders. Also under the DCIM folder will be camera or stream specific folders, such as xxxEOS1D or xxxCANON, where the <code>xxx</code> is a number (100-999) indicating the current photo stream. Images within each photo stream are numbered from 0001 through 9999.</p>

<p>At the same level as the DCIM folder is the MISC folder. This does indeed contain metadata, temporary files, as well as certain settings. Specifically, the MISC folder contains DPOF, or Digital Print Order Format, settings, used when you print directly from the camera to a printer. </p>

<p>The full Canon folder structure is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>\DCIM
    \xxxEOS1D
    \xxxCANON
        \***YYYY.JPG
        \***YYYY.CR2 (raw photo)

        \***YYYY.THM (thumbnail)
        \***YYYY.WAV (audio)

"How can I improve my photographs taken on overcast or cloudy days?","16327","","<p>I'm interested in filters, flash &amp; lighting options, composition, and post processing.</p>

<p>Is it possible to get really vibrant colors or should I give up on that and focus on dreary, muted, or black and white photos when the sun's not out?</p>
","<p>You can definitely improve on the standard ""cloudy day"" look with some preparation at shooting time and a bit of post-processing afterwards.</p>

<h3>As you shoot...</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Switch the camera's <strong>white balance</strong> setting to cloudy: this will help keep the tones a bit warmer.</p></li>
<li><p>Compose to <strong>avoid large amounts of sky</strong>: you can play with the rest of the photo in post-processing but a flat grey sky will never look any better.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <strong>over-exposing</strong> slightly to brighten the shot up a bit. (All cameras do a different job of metering a scene, but if your camera has an exposure compensation setting, start by trying it at +1/3 or +2/3).</p></li>
<li><p>As always, <strong>be alert and be creative</strong>. Look out for glimpses of light as the clouds move, or look for more colourful subject matter (autumn leaves are a great example).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn to love the clouds!</strong> Cloud cover acts as a huge softbox, giving you a very even, diffuse light source. This makes cloudy weather ideal for certain types of photography, for example flower macros, where strong sunlight makes it impossible to capture delicate textures.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>In post-processing...</h3>

<p>The two main things a sunny day gives you are contrast (bright highlights and strong shadows) and vibrant colour. So, to cheer up your cloudy shots:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increase the contrast</strong>. If the big cloud soft box isn't working in your favour, some contrast adjustment will give your photo more punch. Hazy conditions give you even less contrast and tend to need a lot of help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase saturation</strong>. Colours are always more muted on a cloudy day. Experiment a bit and you should find that you can make them more vibrant without going too saturated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase brightness</strong>. Depending on how much over-exposure you tried at the scene, you may find the whole photo needs brightening just a notch or two.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a couple of photos both taken on hopelessly wet, dismal days. The first has benefited from some increased contrast and saturation, the second from contrast and over-exposure. I appreciate they're both of a similar type, but considering the conditions at the time I was really pleased how they turned out.</p>

"How do lens prices compare for Nikon and Canon?","16311","","<p>I am about to buy a new DSLR and shortlisted the two models, Nikon D5100 and Canon 550D. I ready to buy the Nikon model(more expensive) but learned that Nikon lenses are much more expensive than Canon lenses, is this true? I compared the cost of 50mm prime lens from Canon and Nikon and noticed that the Nikon prime lens with motor is almost twice as costly than the Canon lens. However there was a manual focus lens that was of similar cost as Canon. This was very disappointing to me.</p>

<p>Are Nikon and Canon equivalent lenses with built in autofocus motor priced differently?
Lens costs are important for me so I wanted to confirm this.</p>

<p>I also have another question :From the Pics that I have seen on Flickr it seems that Nikon Pics have more saturated Color than Canon. Is it true? Will it be possible to take similar Pics from Canon 550D?</p>
","<p>I suspect that much of the reason for the AF lens price difference boils down to this: Canon has <em>always</em> had autofocus motors in their EF-mount lenses, there never was an EF mount camera with a built-in focus motor. As such, they have a lot of really old AF lens models still in production, like the 50/1.8. </p>

<p>Nikon, on the other hand, has <em>always</em> had autofocus motors in their camera bodies. As such, their old lens designs, while as cheap as equivalent Canon ones, do not have built-in AF motors. (No need for one, they could just use the AF motor in the camera!) However, the consumer-level Nikon camera bodies made in recent years do not have built-in AF motors. And it was only when this happened that there was any reason for Nikon to start making lenses with AF motors (excepting some pro-level lenses that had built-in focus motors for added speed and low noise). </p>

<p>In other words, for a Nikon lens to have a built-in AF motor pretty much guarantees that the lens is a pretty recent one. A similar Canon lens can easily be a twenty year old design that is still in production. And new lenses are more expensive than old lenses, that is just how it is. If you compare the price on a recently designed Canon lens, like the 24/1.4L mk II, with the equivalent Nikon lens, the price is not all that different.</p>

<p>There is an upside to having a recently designed lens though: It is likely to behave somewhat better on a digital camera than an old one that was designed to be used with film. So you do get some benefits for the extra money.</p>

"Why do I keep getting out of focus shots on manual focus?","16304","","<p>I have a Nikon D3300. I recently switched over into complete manual mode (on the camera) with manual focus (on the lens). I find that the camera does not focus <strong>at all</strong>. All I get is out-of-focus shots. This goes away when I switch over to auto-focus.  </p>

<p>My questions:<br>
1. What am I doing wrong? Why is this happening?<br>
2. How do I get rid of this?</p>

<p>P.S: I am using a wide aperture.</p>
","<p>When using manual focus you have to adjust the plane of focus using the focus ring to acquire correct focus. You will have to choose this yourself and if I understand you correctly you have not done this. Of course there is a slight chance that the lens will already be set to focus at the depth you want but they are slim indeed. Using a wide aperture will make this even less likely since a <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/9624/what-exactly-determines-depth-of-field"">wide aperture will give you a very small depth of field</a>.</p>

<p>I know you are using a Nikon 3300 and are probably using the 18-55 mm kit lens too (if you're using something else they will work similarly anyway), but the following image shows the Canon counterpart. Their construction is very similar however. The lens has two rings, one for zooming and one to adjust focus manually.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5xak.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To set the focus manually either look through the viewfinder or use live-view and then turn the manual focus ring of your lens (make sure to set it in manual focus mode first since you might damage the auto focus gear if you turn it otherwise). You will see that some areas blur out and others come into focus. This is a result of you moving the plane of focus of the lens. Make sure that whatever you intend to have in focus is and take the picture.</p>

<p>Please note that shooting as manually as possible when starting out doesn't necessarily give you the most educational experience. It might be better to familiarise yourself with the camera first and then introduce the more advanced features one at a time. Especially auto-focus is something that is very handy and manual focus is best used in special purpose photography such as macro and astrophotograpy.</p>

<li>From the place I live (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), shooting at 5secs@85mm will make stars become star <strike>trails</strike> pills<sup>1</sup>. You might want to consider using a shorter shutter speed to ensure a sharp shot (I'm assuming the space station will ""move"" faster than the star)</li>

"What, if anything, does ""RAW"" stand for?","16270","","<p>I understand that RAW files contain data straight from the sensor, that they're used as input to the production process that results in a final image, and that RAW isn't really one format but a collection of device-specific and mostly proprietary formats. But the fact the files are always described as ""RAW"" (all uppercase) rather than ""raw"" gives the appearance that the name is or was some sort of acronym. If that's the case, what does or did ""RAW"" stand for. If it's not, how did it come to be written that way?</p>
","<p>I suspect the answer here is that the format is written as ""RAW"" to match other common file format names which <em>are</em> acronyms such as JPEG, GIF, MOV, MPEG, etc. <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Learn-And-Explore/Article/ftlzi4ri/nikon-electronic-format-nef.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikon</a>, <a href=""http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/windows_vista/cameras/eos_slr_camera_systems/canon_raw_codec_software"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon</a>, <a href=""http://www.pentax.jp/english/products/k-30/spec/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pentax</a>, <a href=""http://www.hasselblad.com/products/h-system/h4d-40.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hasselblad</a>, <a href=""http://www.olympus.co.jp/en/support/imsg/digicamera/download/software/codec/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Olympus</a>, <a href=""http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/learnandenjoy/7/3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sony</a>, and many other manufacturers all write the format in all caps, so at this point it's a de facto standard. There <em>is</em> a distinction to be made between a raw image file in the ""RAW"" sense, i.e. image data unprocessed by the device, and a raw image file in the sense of ""straight from the camera, not altered using image manipulation software"", and I think writing the file format as ""RAW"" rather than ""raw"" helps to make this clear. When you write it in all caps you're indicating a specific file format, even if that format changes from one device or vendor to another.</p>

<p>Alan Shutko points out in his comment below that older cameras used file systems that only allowed uppercase filenames, like ""IMG_0001.RAW"". This is an excellent point and seems a likely reason that the format was initially written in all caps. </p>

"How to prevent these automatic changes to images that are imported into Lightroom?","16216","","<p>When I open images in Lightroom for the first time, during the loading process I see images that look ""great"", but after a while Lightroom applies some automatic processing to these images that produces results that I then need to get rid of again.</p>

<p>I have no clue why LR does these things, and in preferences I have unchecked all automatic processing options – however this still remains. </p>

<p>How can I get rid of it? What is it, anyways?</p>
","<p>When LR brings in your RAW images, it MUST do a conversion to display them on the screen. The initial image you see is the JPEG preview your camera created by default as part of the RAW creation process.  In order to show you the image on your screen, LR must create a preview, or RAW conversion to show the image on screen. </p>

<p>You can change how LR does its default imports fairly easily.  </p>

<p><strong>Change the Preview you use:</strong></p>

<p>If you do not like the LR created preview, you can use the camera created one:</p>

<p>If you go to your Import screen, you can change how it renders previews. So ""Import"" then on right hand side, look at ""File Handling"". Choose an option under ""Render Previews"". Here you tell it to use the ones from the camera, by selecting 'Minimal' or 'Embedded and Sidecar"". However, if you need (ie zoom in) a higher resolution preview, LR will later render it using LR conversion. (and slow things down).  This will choose the preview to use for each import.</p>

<p><strong>Change the Default Rendering</strong></p>

<p>I believe this is the one you were looking for: If you really want to change ALL previews, for ALL images from your camera and have them look like your camera previews, then simply take any image, perhaps one you shot in RAW+JPEG so you can compare to your camera settings. Then do a basic edit using the Develop Module. Adjust White Balance, Tone, Presence, Curves, Sharpening, etc. Keep this basic,not specific to the image. When you are happy, then choose Develop>Set Default Settings and select ""Update to Current Settings"". Now LR will import using these settings by default for all images from this camera. So, why shouldn't you do this: you may find this doesn't work for all your images, and then you must edit each image to remove it. There is no Undo available, but of course you can remove the results of the edits.</p>

<p><strong>Use Import Develop Settings</strong></p>

<p>The alternative, is to use Auto Import Develop Settings to apply your preferred default settings to every photo you import. So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Develop Module. Edit an image using your personal, basic settings as mentioned above.</li>
<li>On left hand side, find 'Presets' area. Click the '+'. Select the items you wish to save, then name the preset. Save.</li>
<li>Choose, File> Import. On right hand screen you will see ""Apply During Import"" and a drop down for 'Develop Settings'. Choose your named preset. Import.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you have the ability to create many presets, for different conditions or venues, and apply them at import. This works in a similar way to the 'Set Default' above, but you can have many different ones or choose none.</p>

<p>For what its worth, here are my own default import settings:</p>

<pre><code>WhiteBalance As Shot
Auto Tone
Clarity +45
Vibrance +15
Saturation +5
Sharpening +65

<p>So the question is: is this difference important to the camera or not?</p>
","<p>This will not be a problem. Milliamp-hours are a rating of the capacity of the battery (metaphorically, the size of the gas tank), and having extra won't cause any harm. (Basically, it's how long the power will last, not how strong it is.) It's possible but unlikely that cost-cutting in the battery may have other, more problematic issues, but many people use them with no adverse effects.

<p>However, be aware that cheap, third-party batteries often overstate their capacity. So, it's completely likely that the actual capacity is really about the same as the name-brand version — or even lower in real use, despite the much higher <em>labeled</em> rating.</p>

","<p>The camera is likely setting the shutter speed to match the flash sync speed of the camera.

<p>So what would be some key advantages of using manual mode for my sort of photography that are worth the (small amount of) extra hassle involved?</p>

<p>And do you have any tips to minimise the downside (other than practicing to be quick)?</p>
","<p>I typically use aperture priority as well, but I also work a fair bit in manual mode. The typical case for me is if I am in an environment where the lighting situation is quite static, but the subject may have a lot of contrast. Here I switch to manual mode and shoot a few test frames to pinpoint the exposure (typically I try to spot meter on a white surface, and then overexpose that reading by 1.5-2 steps as a first guess).</p>

<p>The main advantage is that you are in full control, and the camera will not be ""fooled"" by unexpected contrasts in the frame. The downside is that it is a bit slower to change exposure in case the lighting situation changes.</p>

","<p>My friend, a fast reply to your answer is that IR wavelength and brands depends only in the kind of colors you want to show in your images and the durability of the filter you want. The brand doesn't matter if you will use the filter a few times per year, so go for the cheapest you could get.</p>

<p>But to understand the 650nm, 670nm, 720nm, 850nm, 950nm, 1000nm numbers, you need to learn first how the light work.</p>

<p>The next figure is the representation of the wavelengths of diferent type of lights, the human eye can ""see"" only the waves between 400nm and 700nm, we call them, COLORS. Above 700nm is the Infrared light, that's the light produced by heat, but human eye can't see that, only feel it as radiation. (IR is btwn 1000nm-10000nm)</p>

<p><a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2011/09/Visible-spectrum.jpeg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Entire Color Wavelenghts http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2011/09/Visible-spectrum.jpeg</a>
Well, the IR Filter function is cut the wavelength light under the XXXnm of the filter. In other words, the IR filter let pass the wavelengths (colors) over the XXnm. So the colors under the XXXnm will not be seen for the lens, but over XXXnm does. As we can see, red colors have 700nm of wavelength and in the market there are filters from 650nm to 1000nm. </p>

<p>Finally, if you want to do an image that shows light red color, dark blue colors and the heat over the objets, you must buy a 650nm, 680nm or 720nm filter. If you want only the heat you must buy 850nm, 950nm or 1000nm.</p>

<p>i.e.:</p>

<p>650nm-720nm</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I93jd.jpg"" alt=""1st IR filter""></p>

<p>720nm-1000nm</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKuiV.jpg"" alt=""2nd IR filter""></p>

<p>In adition of all of those complicated things. As the IR filter let pass lower quantity of light, you will need to increase the exposure time (Lower Shutter Speed), increase the ISO value and decrease the f-stop (Higher aperture) when you take the image, in the way you use a higher XXXnm IR filter. </p>

<p>So my recomendation is get the 650nm for indoor (low light ambience) or get the 950nm for outdoor (day ligth) plus a tripod. If you want a versatile one use the 720nm.</p>

<p>I hope my explanation was useful for you.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>

"How to detect if a photo's metadata has been changed?","15870","","<p>There was a photography contest and it was limited to only three days of shooting - but the winning photo seemed a little out of season. </p>

<p>So I suspect that the winner changed the metadata on the photo. Is there any way to detect if any changes have been made to metadata? Or any way to roll back to the original data?</p>
","<p>It is sadly impossible to to prove when an image (or any file for that matter) originated.  It is possible (if the author wants to) to prove that a file existed prior to a given time by signing the file from a third party time stamping server (through which the third party proves that the file existed at the time of the signing) but such information is not automatically possible and can easily be stripped.</p>

<p>I am also an IT Security guy and there is no possible secure way to prove the creation date of any file if the user controls the system creating the file with current technology that I am aware of.  The best bet would be a device with a locked clock that would have a hidden key store that the user shouldn't have access to and create a signature based on this so that they couldn't fake their own signature, but since the key must still reside in the device, it is still feasibly possible for someone to break as all the necessary information is in their possession, even if it is hard to get to.</p>

<p>As far as detecting an amateur job, there is generally a file creation date in meta data of the file system itself that could be examined and compared to the EXIF metadata, but if they are good at it, they will have altered both and there is some possibility of the file system values getting lost depending on how the file is transferred, so it may not even be reliable.</p>

"How can I get everything in focus?","15847","","<p>I have a Canon 550D with 70-200 f4 and 50mm prime lenses. Although the camera has built-in 9 focal points, I sometimes face a strange problem. Here's a sample photo:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/srOiI.jpg"" alt=""two people, one in focus""></p>

<p>In reference to the above pic, you can see that both of the faces are <strong>NOT</strong> in focus. I used 70-200 f4 for this shot at max aperture. Still, I couldn't get both of them in focus. Why? I also try decreasing the aperture to attain a greater DoF but still, I couldn't get both of them into focus.</p>

<p>Another thing: Although the cam has 9 focal points, why can't I use all of them to focus, say, 9 points in a portrait shot? In manual mode, it has the option to select one of the 9 focal points. And in auto mode, it sometimes select more than one focal points.</p>

<p>This is just an example image. I've faced this problem zillions of times.</p>
","<p>The auto focus points visible in your viewfinder approximate the key areas that the AF sensor is able to measure. The resolution that the AF sensor processes at is pretty low, and how it processes is not exactly how our eyes see focus, so what it ""sees"" as being in focus may or may not be entirely sharp in the final image captured by your sensor. As such, when the AF sensor detects things as being ""in focus"", its reading is fairly general, and not as precise as one would expect or hope much of the time. </p>

<p>See this for an explanation of <a href=""http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs178-10/applets/autofocusPD.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Phase-Detection AF</a> used in most DSLR's.</p>

<p>Regarding depth of field, that can be a complex topic. To start, if you use all of the available focus points with AF, and those points cover parts of a scene with significantly varying depth, then not all of them will necessarily be fully in sharp focus. With Canon DSLR's, when a set of points have ""focused"", they tend to blink. It is pretty rare with any scene containing a measure of depth to blink every focus point...usually only a locus around the area that is mostly in focus will. If you focus on a flat surface, such as a wall, you should be able to see all focus points blink indicating all 9 points have detected in-phase samples of the image. </p>

<p>If you need to have a very deep DOF, you have a couple of options. Obviously, tightening down your aperture will increase your depth of field, but within certain limits. The closer you are to the subject you wish to focus, the shallower you depth of field will be. At considerably great distances, such as you might encounter when photographing a landscape, your depth of field can be immense (but <strong><em>not</em></strong> infinite.) When simply stopping down is not enough (or stopping down softens the image too much due to diffraction), you can always opt for a different lens. </p>

<p>A wider angle of view (short focal length) will allow you to get extremely close to the key subject you want in focus, bringing with it a shallower depth of field. While you have a narrow depth of field, you will still be able to see the general shape and structure of the background, as wide angles tend to either 'decompress' the background behind the subject in focus, or at the very least leave it ""normal"" (i.e. with a 50mm lens on a 35mm sensor.) A narrower angle of view (long focal length) will allow you photograph the same scene from farther away, thereby extending the depth of field. With a narrower field of view, anything that is behind your subject will become more 'compressed' and blurred, further isolating your key subject. It is a very fine balance between depth of field, angle of view, and background compression. With the right range of focal lengths and a calculated approach, you can likely find the right focal length and distance to subject to frame your subjects as you desire while maintaining the proper depth of field.</p>

<p>It is important to note that there will always be a fairly thin plane within which everything is truly in perfect, sharp focus. Beyond that plane, things will begin to blur, although they may blur below the threshold where the human eye can see it. The larger you view the final image, the narrower that plane of true focus will appear to be.</p>

<p>Regarding the sample image you posted. First, what was the smallest aperture you used? You might be able to use a smaller one. You may also try backing up a bit to deepen your field, and crop during post processing to get the same framing. If you have already tried a smaller aperture, I would suggest trying a longer focal length. The two key subjects are relatively in a strait line from the center of the lens, so backing up and using a longer focal length at a greater distance should improve your depth of field without losing much in the way of subject framing. A longer focal length will narrow the field of view, so less of girl in the pink shirt will be captured, at a greater magnification. That will cause her to become even more blurred, possibly beyond the point of recognition (which may be desirable, as it would help isolate your forward subjects.) It may take some experimentation to find the right focal length, and a zoom lens (such as the excellent 70-200mm lens you have) that will let you vary the focal length would be most useful. I would try shooting near the 200mm end at a greater distance, with a moderate aperture of f/8-f/11, and see how things go. </p>

<p>Finally, if AF isn't quite getting it, you should never be afraid to switch to manual. Sometimes AF just can't lock onto your subject, especially with the limited number of AF points in a lower-end body like the 550D. If you have a tripod, Live View zoomed in 10x can be the best tool to get superb focus. Just remember to use the DOF Preview button (small button, front of the camera, just below the larger lens mount release button.) </p>

"In portrait photography, what is 'broad' lighting? What is 'short' lighting?","15842","","<p>What are 'broad' and 'short' lighting when it comes to studio portraiture, and when should I use each?</p>
","<p>Broad Lighting: Is when a subject is posed such that the main light is directed at the side of the face that is closest to the camera. Broad lighting can add weight to a thin face, but it does this by 'adding' roundness/thickness to the face, so it is not a good style of lighting to use with bigger subjects (or even 'normal' subjects with rounder faces.</p>

"How do I light a photo booth with a single flash and an umbrella?","15771","","<p>I run a photobooth for a friend at a party for a side job and last night we came across a predicament.  We only were able to use one flash on a tripod, instead of the usual two, along with the camera flash that has a Gary Fong on it.  I couldn't seem to get rid of some dark shadows under people's arms and ears/hair.</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best placement for the umbrella flash when I come across this again?</strong></p>
","<p>Generally speaking for 'photobooth' style photography the <em>number one</em> priority is for a lighting setup that will work for every single person who sits in front of the camera without having to fiddle with the lighting at all for the entire time the photobooth is set up. Not having to monkey with lighting is what allows the camera operator to get as many people in and out as fast as possible with very predictable and uniform results.</p>

<p>It is actually a relatively easy thing to to do with a single light source... Simply place the light directly behind and above the photographer pointing right at the subject adjust the light's power once at the beginning of the evening to get a reasonable balance, and you shouldn't have to adjust it again. This will produce a flat light that is not especially interesting (or all that great looking) but it will tend to give a bit of sparkle to the eyes, and most importantly will light people's faces in a uniform way and will eliminate <em>any</em> harsh shadows from the subject.</p>

<p>Companies that provide these types of photographs (santa pictures, yearbook photos, prom pictures, photobooths, etc.) often refer to this as 'yearbook portrait' lighting (as well as other <em>much</em> more derogatory terms), but its value to these companies is that it's less of a 'lighting style' and more a method of lighting that produces 'adequate results and can be taught to a minimum-wage camera operator in a 2-hour training session'... </p>

"What image quality is lost when re-saving a JPEG image in MS Paint?","15761","","<p>Has anyone ever noticed that if you open a image in mspaint (.jpg, .jpeg) and then just save it, the image size is reduced by many folds. I use this method to reduce the file size.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure about the quality loss due to this. Can anyone please tell/explain the quality loss if any using this method?</p>
","<p>The fact that the image file gets smaller tells you that you are losing quality. The JPEG format is optimised for a size vs. quality compromise, so the file size is more or less a direct measure of the quality.</p>

<p>If you view the image and zoom to 1:1 scale or more, you can usually see the artifacts caused by the JPEG compression.</p>

<p>The compression works by making 8x8 pixel blocks with a color gradient to resemble the original data as close as possible, then the difference between that mosaic and the original data is stored with the amount of precision that corresponds to the quality level chosen. The higher the compression, the more of the mosaic is visible.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how the compression artifacts are visible around the edges of an object (a maple leaf) against a smooth background (the sky):</p>

"Which camera to buy - Canon EOS 6D or Canon EOS 7D Mark II","15756","","<p>I'm planning to buy a new camera body, and I'm unable to decide between the 6D and the newly announced 7D Mark II. Which camera should I go for? How much of a difference does a full frame camera (6D) make over an APS-C? I'm mainly into landscapes and a little bit of astrophotography. From what I understand, Full frames are much better for astrophotography, but is the difference in image quality big enough to justify the loss of all the other features? As far as I can see, the only advantage of the 6D is the full frame sensor. Every other feature that I need is much better in the 7D Mark II. Exactly how much of a difference is there in the image quality of these sensors?</p>
","<p>From an image quality standpoint the 6D has a fairly significant advantage over any of Canon's current APS-C offerings. Since the 7D Mark II has been announced but not yet released and hasn't been in the hands of most reputable reviewers/independent testers yet, it is hard to judge the image quality. Suffice it to say it would need a totally revolutionary sensor that exceeds the image quality of any APS-C camera made by anyone now on the market to approach that of the 6D.</p>

<p>I can tell just by looking at one of my images whether it was shot with my 7D or with my 5DII or 5DIII. The advantages hold all the way through the processing workflow with regard to single images, so for landscape photos the 6D is definitely the more capable camera.</p>

<p>For astrophotography the 6D also has an advantage, but for different reasons. Since much astrophotography involves stacking multiple photos to create one image, the difference in noise performance can be pretty much equalized. But the difference in Field of View when using the same lenses can not. And the wider the lens, the more it usually costs and the slower it is. To get the FoV of a 24mm f/2.8 using a FF camera you would need a 15mm f/1.8 on an APS-C body. The EF 24mm f/2.8 runs about $600, There is no 15mm f/1.8, but an EF 14mm f/2.8 L II wil cost you about $2300.</p>

Before I discovered this, I purchased a wired remote, which did the trick also, but the wireless remote is so much easier.</p>
","<p>You have a couple of options, you could shoot four 30 second frames and then average them in software. This solution doesn't require any extra gear, however it requires you to reopen the shutter quickly for each exposure (which could rock the camera) and introduces the possibility of having gaps in your light trials.</p>

<p>Alternatively, most wired remotes offer the ability to lock the shutter button down so you can let go of the remote until you need to reopen the shutter. Combine this with bulb mode and you can get 2 minute exposures easily without rocking the camera.</p>

","<p>The question here doesn't — or shouldn't — come down to what we prefer, but rather what you want to use it for.

<p>On your APS-C Nikon, the 50mm lens acts as a short portrait lens. It's kind of awkward for most anything else, but is just about perfect for taking head-and-shoulders portraits. I say awkward because it's not enough ""reach"" to pick out details like a longer telephoto lens, but is narrow enough that it's difficult to frame indoor scenes. That doesn't mean you can't use it more generally, of course.</p>

<p>The wider 35mm acts as a <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/19343/1943"">normal</a> lens — it gives a comfortable and versatile field of view that doesn't feel either wide-angle or telephoto. For that reason, if you're just going to pick one of the two, this is <em>probably</em> going to be your best bet. But it depends on what you're looking for — a portrait lens may be just what you need.</p>

Other less common options are <strong>gif</strong> and <strong>tiff</strong>.</p>

<p>So which option should I select? What are the <em>merits and demerits</em> of using a particular <em>file format</em>?</p>
","<p>JPEG is lossy, which means it compresses the image (in part) by discarding data. The data it discards is (normally) chosen to minimize the affect on the quality of the image, but it (virtually) always loses at least a little quality -- and depending on the quality level you choose, it can lose quite a bit. For most photographs it should be considered a display-only format -- once you've converted something to JPEG, you don't want to do any more editing on it. If you need to make changes, you re-start from some other format, make the changes, and do another JPEG conversion.</p>

<p>GIF uses only lossless compression, but is limited to 8-bit (256) colors, which is quite limiting for photographs.</p>

<p>PNG was designed as a replacement for GIF, and mostly succeeds. It supports 24-bit color (8 bits each for red, green, and blue) and uses lossless compression.</p>

<p>TIFF is really a container format that allows you to insert various kinds of data into the container. While it's used primarily for images, it's really almost like a file system, so you could theoretically use it for almost any kind of data. This has a couple of consequences. One is that even if a program supports TIFF files, it may not support <em>all</em> TIFF files -- e.g., many don't support LZW-compressed images. In fact, few programs support all possible TIFF files. Another consequence is that TIFF tends to have a fair amount of overhead, and writing code to support TIFF (at all well) is a pain (which is why so many programs support it only incompletely).</p>

<p>BMP is basically just a Windows device independent bitmap written out to disk. It has only <em>extremely</em> limited support for compression (and <em>most</em> BMPs aren't compressed at all). Programs written for Windows can read/write BMP <em>really</em> easily, but there's not much else to recommend it (in particular, BMP files tend to be <em>quite</em> large for the amount of data being stored).</p>

<p>Conclusion: JPEG is useful as an output format (e.g., to display things on web pages it's good because it's compact, and virtually everybody can read it).</p>

<p>As an intermediate format that you might use (for example) to store a file that might later be edited, TIFF is about the only one of these that's really of much use.</p>

<p>The others (GIF, PNG, BMP) aren't really of much use for photographs.</p>

"How to photograph people with a prominent (wide, big) nose?","15642","","<p>One of my friends wants me to take pictures of her but she is very self-conscious about her nose (which is relatively wide, Monty Python anyone?).   </p>

<p>She wants me to take pictures in such a way as to not emphasize that particular feature.  </p>

<p>Any tips on angle, lens and light combination would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Would something change if the nose were <em>big</em> rather wide?</p>
","<p>You want to be shooting more or less dead on to the subject, not to the side. The rule of thumb is that the line of the nose should not 'break' the line of the cheek, and this is doubly true for nasally well-endowed subjects.</p>

<p>Avoid wide-angle lenses like the plague - you need to be looking at a 100-135mm lens ideally, as it will flatten the photograph somewhat.</p>

<p>Lighting should be very soft to prevent the nose casting tell-tale shadows. A large softbox is ideal, or if you are using natural light try fixing a thin white cloth or paper to a window to soften the light right down.</p>

<p>EDIT: Since you've mentioned that the subject's nose is wide, I would disregard the first point and instead shoot from an angle. I'll leave the answer as it is otherwise so both wide and long noses are catered for :)</p>

"How do camera body motors compare to in-lens motors for focusing?","15590","","<p>What is the difference between using a motor on the camera body and the motor built into lenses? </p>

<p>Aside from how both compare in terms of speed, what differences would I notice if I use a body with a motor and motor-less lens, and a lens with motor on a body that lacked one?</p>

<p>A comparison chart outlining the various lens motor types would be a great help as high end USM motors for Sigma lenses are faster then their regular versions.</p>
","<p><strong>Sometimes</strong> the AF motor in a lens is a screw and gear type, and in that case it's really not much different to an in-body motor except that it actually has the <em>disadvantage</em> of being more bulky.  This is the case on many lower cost lenses (including many kit lenses).</p>

<p><strong>At other times</strong> the AF motor in a lens is of the ultrasonic motor type, which uses direct drive, requiring no gears and is superior to a screw and gear type used in camera bodies for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is very quiet (often called ""Silent Wave Motor"")</li>
<li>It can move fairly quickly</li>
<li>It can be less bulky</li>
<li>It can allow manual focus override without disengaging autofocus</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_motor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Wikipedia page on the ultrasonic motor</a> (which was apparently pioneered by Canon) is quite interesting and has diagrams.</p>

<p><em>As mattdm has helpfully pointed out in the comments, some newer screw and gear type autofocus drives are being marketed by Canon as ""Micro USM"".  This is, in my opinion, deceptive.  These still have gears so they don't have the advantages listed above.</em></p>

<p>A lens motor in your camera body only adds a small amount of bulk, and means that your lens selection is a little better and you can AF with some of the cheaper lenses.  If you think you'll be served fine by lenses with in-built motors, it doesn't matter so much whether you have it in the body.  Obviously, the ultrasonic motor or SWM lenses are the better technology and these don't depend on a lens motor in the body.</p>

<p>As has been answered before, if both your camera body and lens have an AF motor, the lens one is used.  And that's the way you'd normally want it because these are usually superior.</p>

<p>This is not an issue with Canon, who do not produce in-body autofocus motors.</p>

<p>The L Series (non-IS) Canon EF 70-200mm f/4.0 L USM or the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM?</p>

<p>I am an enthusiast and usually shoot landscape, my kids playing indoors and out, some people and architecture. </p>

<p>Already have the Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS that came with my 60D but also purchased the Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Lens only because I like this focal length and the speed of this lens.</p>

<p>I am not thrilled with the budget EF-S 18-135mm and need something that is better quality and has more reach. Eventually I would also like to get a better wide angle and get rid of the kit lens all together but that will be in next year's budget. For now I am deciding between the two above. I am leaning towards the L-series lens but cannot afford the IS in this class. The Canon EF 70-300mm comes with IS. Is the IS on the L series really that important? </p>
","<p>I tried both, and purchased the L lens.  One thing to note, is that the IS USM lens is 5.6 at 300mm, and something between at 200mm (don't recall exactly). The L is f4 at 200, always. As you probably have discovered, both lenses are quite close in price.</p>

<p>True, the IS USM is 300mm, and it is IS.  IS is nice when trying to shoot at 300mm and handheld, especially when you do not have a tripod and especially when your shutter speed is near 1/300 or lower. So, if you expect to find yourself in these situations often, then perhaps you should lean in this direction.</p>

<p>However, the L lens is brighter, focuses impossibly fast, has manual focus override, and it zooms internally, so it stays the same size always, never extending. But, even with all that, the difference in sharpness and clarity are simply amazing, and still, after thousands of shots and 3 years, bring a smile to my face, and causes giddy pixel peeping every time.</p>

<p>The 70-200 f4 L lens, is, in my opinion, the best bargain among the L lineup, and just maybe the entire Canon lens list.  I can highly recommend this lens, and unless you absolutely must have 300mm, you should purchase this lens.</p>

<p>To see these differences in clarity and sharpness, be sure to <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops.aspx?Lens=404&amp;Camera=453&amp;Sample=0&amp;FLI=0&amp;API=0&amp;LensComp=358&amp;CameraComp=453&amp;SampleComp=0&amp;FLIComp=0&amp;APIComp=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">look at these comparisons</a> that are available on the-digital-picture.com.

JPEG is processed image data.
Typically, raw-files from modern cameras have 12-14-bit per pixel which means up to 16384 values (for more details see Michael Clark's comment). JPEG can have only 256 luminance values per RGB channel. This means that jpeg contains much less data than a corresponding raw-file. 
So no, there is no way to convert a jpeg to raw.</p>

<p>Technically, it's possible of course to convert jpeg data <strong>format</strong> to raw data format (<em>like it's possible to convert a jpg to png or gif</em>) but this will not make a raw-file and the organizers of competition will surely see that it's not a true raw file.

"How can I add a border to a JPEG photo without affecting quality?","15414","","<p>I have a photo in JPEG format with resolution 4680x3120. I want to add a white border around this photo, turning it into a 5200x3467 photo (for printing reasons).</p>

<p>Clearly, I am not altering or removing anything from the photo, I am simply adding something. Therefore, in principle this procedure can be lossless. However, if I were to use Paint to add this border, the Saving process of Paint will compress the photo again into the JPEG format, thereby losing information and quality.</p>

<p>Is there a way (some more professional program) to add something to a JPEG photo, like a border, without affecting the original part of the photo, without reducing its quality?</p>
","<p>Although <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/61027/4141"">Philip's answer</a> is the best way to go, it is possible to do what you want entirely within the sphere of JPEG.</p>

<p>JPEG works by breaking your image up into blocks called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Block_splitting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Minimum Coding Units</a> (MCUs), typically 16&times;16 each, and compressing them separately. You can see this in images when you crank the compression level up very high. At more reasonable compression levels, the blocks blend together so smoothly that you never see the borders.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this fact to losslessly add a simple white border to an image. We simply have to create a hollow array of white blocks equal to the output image size, then drop the original JPEG MCU blocks into the middle.¹</p>

<p>There is a downside to that technique: it only works when the input and output image sizes are both an even multiple of the MCU size. When that is not the case, we need to recompress some of the blocks at the margin between the white border and the original image's edges. You won't see this difference in the output if you stay away from the excessively high JPEG compression levels, so it's still <em>effectively</em> lossless.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any program that does only this. The closest thing I'm aware of is something that does the inverse operation: <a href=""http://jpegclub.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jpegtran</a> has a crop function that losslessly cuts away parts of the image edges.² It does so by discarding the cropped-away MCUs along the image edges, leaving those in the middle untouched.</p>

<p>The simplest ready-made solution I'm aware of is the <a href=""http://www.betterjpeg.com/jpeg-plug-in.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Better JPEG Lossless Resave</a> plugin for Photoshop. It uses techniques based on the ideas given above to copy MCUs from the original image wherever it can, in order to avoid re-creating them from the uncompressed version, as Photoshop normally does.³</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Digressions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>You might think that the resulting border will be <em>not quite white</em>, since the lossiness of JPEG will create some kind of color difference in the output. I did some testing, and in Photoshop at least, a purely white image saved via Save For Web's JPEG level 10 (i.e. ""low"" quality) results in a decoded image that is still purely white.</p>

<p>I determined this with two tests:</p>

<p>First, I loaded the JPEG as a layer on top of the original, set the top layer's blend mode to Difference, then added a Levels adjustment layer above it to try and magnify the differences. The resulting image stayed black, indicating ""no difference.""</p>

<p>Second, when I failed to see the expected differences, I dropped the adjustment layer and returned the JPEG layer to Normal blend mode, picked up the eyedropper tool, and looked all over the image for a pixel that didn't show as RGB (255,255,255) in the Info panel. I never found one. I expected to see the numbers flicker a little bit as I scrubbed over the image, but they stayed rock-steady.</p>

<p>I can only conclude that this is a degenerate case of the encoding algorithm: pure white blocks stay white through the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">discrete cosine transform</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this does <em>not</em> happen with pure black blocks. At least with Photoshop's implementation, they turn into RGB (1,1,1) when decoded, not RGB (0,0,0).</p>

<p>Bottom line, you don't need to worry about sputtered dots in this border area when printing an image produced using the above technique.</p></li>
<li><p><code>jpegtran</code> is a command line program, but there is also a GUI Windows program based on the same code called <code>jpegcrop</code>.</p></li>

"What does the 'macro' mode on my camera actually do?","15300","","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>In light of the above I'm curious as to what macro mode actually does in cameras such as mine. Is it perhaps simply biasing the auto-focus, or is something else mechanical happening in the lens?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm curious as to what macro mode actually does in cameras such as mine. Is it perhaps simply biasing the auto-focus, or is something else mechanical happening in the lens?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>I have outlined the two main areas that Macro mode affects in general terms below under ""Background"".</p></li>
<li><p>Following is a general comment on macro mode and how this may affect your images and what to look for to see it it has had any effect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have copied <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz20/5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>DPReview comments on the DMC-FZ20 macro facility - from here</strong></a> at the end of this post. It's surprisingly uninformative re what actually does happen to achieve the effect and what the limitations are, but does discuss results.  </p>

<p>The most important answer to your questions is that </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>if the photo is in focus and correctly exposed then it will be acceptable regardless of macro mode having been used</strong>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Setting the camera to macro mode may have affected  certain camera settings but these will have been in the acceptable range if the result is acceptable. There will be no ""hidden affects"" which are not obvious from a general inspection.</p>

<p>The two factors that are most liable to be noticeable (but still not ""bad"" is that the aperture may have been set to achieve largest possible depth of field (see below) and shutter speed may have been set to a specific value or range of values (also see below). </p>

<p>Some cameras when in Macro mode will not be able to focus to infinity - this may be the case with your camera and you may have been lucky wityh subject distance, or it may not apply in your case.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophotography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Wikipedias 'definition' is useful but not hard and fast</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Macrophotography is extreme close-up photography, usually of very small subjects, in which the size of the subject in the photograph is greater than life size.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/54Ok2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a> Classically a macrophotograph is one in which the size of the subject on the negative or image sensor is life size or greater.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XjVtK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a> However in modern use it refers to a finished photograph of a subject at greater than life size.  </p>

<p>[3] The ratio of the subject size on the film plane (or sensor plane) to the actual subject size is known as the reproduction ratio. Likewise, a macro lens is classically a lens capable of reproduction ratios greater than 1:1, although it often refers to any lens with a large reproduction ratio, despite rarely exceeding 1:1.</p>

<hr></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>(1) The most fundamental requirement which applies to (almost) any ""Macro mode"" settings, is to arrange the lens elements so that the minimum focus distance is ""low enough"" to allow a ""usefully small"" object to appear ""large enough"" in the image.  </p>

<p>If the camera cannot achieve this is ""normal mode"" the manufacturer may move or insert lens elements to reduce the minimum focusing distance of the lens. The resultant arrangement may or may not allow focusing at infinity. It is possible that this lens arrangement makes results less acceptable distortioin wise at certain apertures but if so you would expect the manufacturer to also constrain the available range to suit.  </p>

<p>I used the wonderfully vague low enough / usefully small / large enough on purpose. There is no absolute definition of where the boundaries are in each case and generally if a camera has a ""mode"" that improves macro (= ""small object"") photography then it is probably a compromise camera and a compromise macro arrangement. That is not meant to denigrate such cameras - simply to note that adding the facility to the camera as a whole is not the norm with top end cameras where the lens will be removable* and the macro capability is a lens function.</p>

<p>I say ""almost any macro mode setting"" as I have seen lenses labelled as having macro capability which do indeed allow small objects to be imaged at large size BUT have an extremely large minimum focus distance. I recall a 70-300mm ""macro"" zoom I owned which had a minimum focusing distance of about 3 metres / 10 feet but which was in fact still useful for photographing small objects.</p>

<p>(2) All that said, there is a separate related set of functionalities that a manufacturer may add. They may decide that to obtain an acceptable depth of field at small distances the aperture will be limited to smaller values or even the smallest available value (larger /f numbers). They may make decisions about white balance, shutter speed, ISO and more. Such decisions are specific to each manufacturer and even to each camera but will be aimed at optimising small object results.</p>

<p>SO your camera may be ""good enough"" with respect to 1. above that no action is needed to adjust the lens system to achieve closer minimum focus and all actions may be in the area covered by 2. In which case ""macro mode"" is usable to infinity. Trying this before you next need to use the feature 'in anger' would be wise.</p>

<hr>

<p>I once owned (and still do - somewhere) a Sony Mavica camera with 640 x 480 maximum image size and floppy diskette storage.  File size was typically a massive 50 -100 kB/photo. The Mavica had the ability to focus on the inside of the lens cap if you could work out how to get light in there !. This was without any advertising of a ""macro mode"". Very useful. </p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>A very few ""top end"" camera have fixed non interchangeable lenses, but these are usually niche specialist cameras and/or produced to address an enthusiast market - eg the APSC sensor rangefinder cameras being produced by several manufacturers with appearances and ""optical feel"" similar to those of the classic 35mm film rangefinders. </li>

<p>DPReview comments on DMC FZ-20 macrofocus capability:</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz20/5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (same web page as above). </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The FZ20 has a rather unusual approach to macro focusing. There is no macro button, and in A, S and M modes the full focus range (from 5cm to infinity at the wide end of the zoom) is available all the time, whereas in P (fully automatic) mode you can only focus down to 30cm; presumably to speed up focusing in everyday snap shooting situations.  </p>

<p>Then there is a separate macro mode (on the main mode dial) that offers fully automatic exposure - just like the P mode - but focuses down to 5cm (again at the wide end of the zoom). </p>

<p>As is common in zoom cameras the FZ20's macro capabilities are much better at the wide end of the zoom (5cm subject distance capturing an area around 43mm across), and there is inevitably some barrel distortion (and some color fringing). At the full 12x zoom position the close focus ability is less impressive - a subject distance of 200cm capturing an area around 12cm across, <strong>but there is no distortion at all</strong>.</p></li>

I want to make an Android application that displays virtual tours with spherical panoramas.<br>
In one scene, there is something like a ball / sphere, with the camera inside, on its center, and the user can look freely in 3-dimensional 360 degrees.</p>

<p>I'm using PanoramaGL for Android (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/panoramagl-android/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://code.google.com/p/panoramagl-android/</a>), by Javier Baez.<br>

","<p>Spherical panoramas have a 2:1 aspect ratio because the field-of-view is 360° x 180°. You obviously need enough photos to cover the whole surrounding. If you use stitching software, then you need to have some overlap between images and will take slightly more images than enough to cover exactly the 360°.</p>

<p>As a minimal setup, a single camera with a lens on each side, mounted on a tripod, can do this. If you use <a href=""http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/spherical/RICOH_THETA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">such camera</a>, a remote-trigger device, like a cell-phone is needed to trigger it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, most camera will do. If the camera has manual controls, including manual focus, then it will be easier because you can ensure consistency between shots. With a smaller the field-of-view, more shots will be necessary. Considering your resolution requirements are low though, I would opt for something very wide. With a <a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/549962-USA/Sunex_DSLR01N_5_6mm_f_5_6_SuperFisheye_Fixed.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fisheye lens covering 185°</a>, you only need two shots. A compatible camera is obviously required.</p>

<p>Ideally you take the shots while rotating around the nodal-point of the lens. Doing so precisely by hand is nearly impossible, so most people use a panoramic head. If your lens is fixed focal-length, there are some models which are made precisely for a combination of camera and lens and need no adjustments. Otherwise, you need to calibrate the head to your particular combination of camera and lens at the focal-length you intend to use. This is not hard, just tedious and you have to be careful not to accidentally change things. The closer things are to your camera, the more important this is. For an indoor spherical panorama, consider a panoramic head essential.</p>

<p>Most stitching software can stitch such images and the success-rate depends mostly on the subject matter. You can even try free software first and if those do not work, move on to a paid solution. A good number of software now attempt to automatically stitch images which works surprisingly well. One such is <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/ICE/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MS ICE</a> which I <a href=""http://www.neopanoramic.com/review/ms_ice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reviewed here</a>.

","<p>One technique often used to deal with those ""shiny spots"" as well as many other skin blemishes is called <em>frequency separation</em>.</p>

<p>From <em><a href=""http://fstoppers.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-frequency-separation-technique"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Ultimate Guide To The Frequency Separation Technique</a>:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frequency Separation technique is virtually a process of decomposing of the image data into spatial frequencies, so that we can edit image details in the different frequencies independently. There can be any number of frequencies in each image, and each frequency will contain certain information (based on the size of the details). Typically, we break down the information data in our images into high and low frequencies.</p>
  
  <p>Like in music any audio can be represented in sine waves, we can also break up an image into low and high frequency sine waves. High frequencies in an image will contain information about fine details, such as skin pores, hair, fine lines, skin imperfections (acne, scars, fine lines, etc.).</p>
  
  <p>Low frequencies are the image data that contains information about volume, tone and color transitions. In other words: shadows and light areas, colors and tones. If you look at only the low frequency information of an image, you might be able to recognize the image, but it will not hold any precise detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In a nutshell: <em>frequency separation</em> allows you to separate texture from  color, particularly the texture and color of a model's skin, and work on each individually before combining them back together.</strong></p>

<p>There are a plethora of online articles that discuss <em>frequency separation</em> and show how to do it with particular applications, particularly Photoshop CS. Many of the concepts can be translated to work with other tools, such as GIMP or other full orbed photo processing applications. Most of these tutorials are fairly involved and beyond the scope of distilling in an answer here. Be prepared to spend some time to learn how to do <em>frequency separation</em>. This isn't one of those ""90 seconds to <em>amazing images</em>"" photography tips!</p>

"How to photograph sparkly objects?","15219","","<p>I've been having the hardest time photographing objects that are encrusted in rhinestones and capturing their sparkle.</p>

<p>My understanding of sparkle is that it comes from two components: the dynamic range of our eyes and movement of our heads. Screens don't do a good job of reproducing the dynamic range that our eyes can see and still photos don't do a good job of reproducing movement.</p>

<p>I've looked at various other answers on this site, but I'm still left wanting a truly ""sparkly"" picture. I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/19045/how-to-set-up-a-diamond-for-photography/19119#19119"">Placing the object on a reflective surface</a> (black acrylic did a pretty good job for this. It shows a reflection of the object, but effectively dimmed by a number of stops, so the bits that sparkle are still bright)</li>
<li>Using a video of the object slowly moving, instead of still photos. This is probably the best option so far, but as one might imagine it's not always a usable option.</li>
<li>Using a number of bright point light sources (e.g. non-diffused LEDs, xmas lights).</li>
<li><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2880/what-are-the-key-things-to-think-about-when-photographing-jewelry/14600#comment30894_18592"">Using a single bright point light source</a>, such as a flashlight/torch or non-diffused halogen lamp</li>
<li>Long exposures, short exposures; narrow apertures, wide ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter what I do, I get more diffuse light (which is good for giving the overall appearance of the object), but very little sparkle. I understand that sparkle is small, bright points of light shining back at the camera, from the mirrored surface of the rhinestone facets, but somehow it never seems enough when captured by the camera.</p>

<p>Perhaps the real question is: how do you show sparkle on a low dynamic-range display? How do you capture it and if it's not easy to capture, is there a way to convince your eye to see something as sparkly?</p>

<p>Here's an example of a shot that I've been trying to make more sparkly:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a8MWH.jpg"" alt=""Photo of a rhinestone encrusted prescription bottle""> (artwork by Judith Klausner, photo by myself)</p>

<p>The above photo was lit by a single halogen bulb above the camera and a flash pointed directly at it off to the right and above the camera. It was taken within a diffusion box with the front entirely open and black velvet on the left / back side, and black acrylic underneath it all. 90mm manual prime macro lens on a D600 at F16 with a 1.3"" exposure.</p>
","<p>First of all, it's important to realize that, when you photograph a reflective object, <strong>you're actually photographing the surrounding scenery as it reflects off the object.</strong>  This means that it's not enough to just set the object in a lightbox and maybe point some spot lights at it, at least unless you <em>want</em> to make the reflections rather simple and dull.</p>

<p>Instead, what you want, to give the reflections contrast and ""sparkle"" (not <em>actual</em> sparkle, defined as small spots bright enough to produce visible flaring in the photo, but just the appearance of glitter) is to surround the object with high-contrast scenery that produces the appropriate look when reflected off the object.  (Of course, you usually need to leave some neutral background behind the object, but this need not be a large area, especially if you use a long lens.)  This is as much an art as science, but here are a few things to try:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add high-contrast edges to the background.  If you're using a lightbox, try covering parts of the inside of the box with black cloth / plastic / cardboard, or with colored translucent paper or plastic.</p></li>
<li><p>Add gradients to the background.  When reflected off a faceted object, each facet will reflect a small part of the gradient, giving both contrast between facets and subtle color gradations within each facets.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the colors in the background to give the effect you want.  With a reflective object, the colors you see in the photo depend as much on the surroundings as on the object itself, so you can ""paint"" the object by choosing the appropriate background.</p></li>
<li><p>Use or mimic natural backgrounds, as these often have color schemes and patterns that, even when scrambled by reflection, evoke desirable feelings in the viewer.  Even if you go for a purely abstract background, it's often a good idea to e.g. keep the darker areas of the surroundings in the bottom half, and the lighter areas in the top half, as our brains have evolved to expect such an arrangement and find it natural.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for actual sparkles, these are formed when a small fraction of the facets in the object reflect something so bright that it saturates the camera (or the eye) and creates flares.  If your object has enough small facets, just pointing a single bright light source at it will indeed produce sparkles.  If not, you may need to use <strong>multiple small point lights</strong> (such as LEDs, halogen lights or small mirror reflectors pointed at the object) to obtain more sparkles.</p>

<p>One trick you can use is to fix the object and the camera in place, and then move the point lights around until you get nice sparkles from each of them.  For a more natural-looking result, you may also want to preferentially place the sparkle sources in ""natural"" locations, such as in the lighter parts of the surroundings or near the main light source.</p>

<p>Also note that the appearance of the sparkles will strongly depend on your camera and lens.  For pretty ""starburst"" sparkles, you'll probably want to <strong>use a narrow aperture</strong> and/or a <strong><a href=""http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/DigiCam/User-Guide/filter/filter-star.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">cross-screen (""star"") filter</a></strong>.  <a href=""http://www.slrlounge.com/school/diffraction-aperture-and-starburst-effects/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""SLR Lounge: Diffraction, Aperture, and Starburst Effects"">This page from SLR Lounge</a> shows some nice examples of the effect of aperture on sparkles in photos:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.slrlounge.com/school/diffraction-aperture-and-starburst-effects/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""SLR Lounge: Diffraction, Aperture, and Starburst Effects""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9793.jpg"" alt=""Image""></a><br>

<p>Finally, note that <strong>dynamic range</strong> is very important here.  The notable thing about sparkles is that they're <em>much</em> brighter than the rest of the object.  You can't really reproduce the true intensity of the sparkles on screen (or on paper), even if your camera could record it in the first place, so you have to find ways to give the <em>impression</em> of brightness without the actual brightness.</p>

<p>Starbursts are one way of achieving this; so is the use of a dark reflective surface, as you've done, as it effectively gives the viewer two pictures of the object, taken with different exposures, that the brain can combine to reconstruct more of the dynamic range you'd see if you were looking at the object directly.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Ps.</strong> I wrote most of the above before you posted your example photo.  Having seen it, my specific suggestions would be to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the black acrylic &mdash; it seems to work very nicely for what you're trying to do.</li>
<li>Step down the lens further, or get a starburst filter for your lens, to add more ""sparkle"" to your sparkles.  (This alone might do the trick for you.)</li>
<li>With that many facets, you <em>probably</em> don't need too many light sources to get decent sparkles.  The <em>non-sparkly</em> parts of the object might benefit from a bit more diffuse lighting, though, possibly with some subtle color to add contrast.  Consider replacing some of the black velvet, especially on the left, with lighter colors and/or gradients, and maybe adding some secondary light sources.</li>
<li>While you're adding some diffuse lighting, consider moving the main light source a bit more off to the side.  Right now, most of the sparkles are on facets facing pretty straight into the camera, giving the picture a bit of the unnatural look often associated with excessive use of in-camera flash.</li>

"What software can show my most frequently used focal length?","15202","","<p>Many people recommend a focal length of 35mm, 50mm, and sometimes even 85mm and upwards for those interested in purchasing a prime lens. I, however, would like to figure out what focal length(s) I use most often, and then purchase a prime with that approximate focal length.  </p>

<p>Is there a piece of software that will analyze thousands of photos and then tell me how many times I used a certain focal length?</p>
","<p>Someone referred me once to <a href=""http://www.cpr.demon.nl/prog_plotf.html"">Exposure Plot</a>. This is a <strong>free</strong> Windows utility which is very simple. It shows you graphs of different parameters, one of them being focal-length.</p>

<p>If you already use image management application like <strong>Lightroom</strong> or <strong>Bibble Pro</strong>, then you can also usually see that data in the <em>filter</em> interface.</p>

<p>For Lightroom for example, you need to activate the filter bar (/), select <em>Metadata</em> and change one of the columns to show <em>Focal-Length</em>. You'll get to see all the focal-lengths used and the number of photos taken at each focal-length. What's neat is that you can combine things like rating and focal-length, to find out which focal-length is used in your best images.</p>

"Are ""Windows Photo Viewer"" rotations lossless?","15185","","<p>Can I rotate lossily compressed photos that I view in <em>Windows Photo Viewer</em> without worrying about losing even more information to compression?</p>
","<p>If the dimensions of the image are multiples of 8 (or 16 if chroma subsampling is used) then the rotations are lossless. Otherwise it is not possible to rotate the image without recomputing the blocks i.e. recompressing the image, which is lossy.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that jpeg images are broken up into a series of 8x8 or 16x16 blocks which are compressed individually. Incomplete blocks are only allowed on the right edge and bottom edge. Thus is your image is not an exact multiple of 8/16 it will contain incomplete blocks, which will end up on the wrong edge after rotation.</p>

<p>I verified the above assertion using the version of Windows Photo Viewer that ships with Windows 7. I used two images of colour noise. One image was 256x256 i.e. both sizes multiples of 8. The other image was the same but cropped to 253x253 i.e. neither size was a multiple of 8. Here are the images:</p>

253x253</p>

<p>I then performed four anti-clockwise rotations, closing photo viewer after each rotation to ensure the image was saved in it's rotated state.</p>

253x253</p>

<p>There's no need to perform a subtraction to see the difference with the 253 pixel image, it's noticeably darker and muddier!</p>

"What causes this sort of RAW file corruption?","15176","","<p>I came home from a recent trip to Gettysburg with almost 1500 photos.  Among them were a handful that appear to have been corrupted, as shown below.  It was hot during the hikes -- ambient temperature was near or above 100 Fahrenheit, so I suspect the heat contributed to the problem.</p>

<p>These files exhibit some interesting behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I view them in Lightroom or Windows Explorer, the files show normally for a split-second, then are over-painted with the light area you see below.</li>
<li>If I try to open the file in Canon's Digital Photo Professional, the thumbnail view shows the complete (uncorrupted) file, but DPP refuses to open the files for processing, saying that they're corrupt.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't tried to figure out if all the files came from the same card, but all cards were formatted in-camera prior to the trip.</p>

<p>I don't believe I've lost anything important at this point, as I shot multiple frames of most subjects, but I'd really like to know what caused this problem, and what, if anything can be done to resurrect these files.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnErv.jpg"" alt=""corrupt raw files""></p>
","<p>I can only answer your second question - i.e. if anything can be done to resurrect these files. As others have mentioned, that uncorrupted version you're seeing briefly as you import them into Lightroom is the preview JPEG generated in-camera when you shoot RAW. There are plenty of tools that will recover those previews for you, hopefully even if the RAW file itself is corrupted. (The fact that you're seeing the previews in other software is an encouraging sign.)</p>

<p>Check <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/38600/3644"">this accepted answer</a> for a list of software. I've tried <a href=""http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dcraw</a> and it worked a treat.</p>

"What does ""Humidity at Less than 85% (no condensation)"" mean in a camera's specifications?","15118","","<p>Under the heading ""Operating Environment"", my camera syas:</p>

<pre><code>Less than 85% (no condensation)
</code></pre>

<p>What does it actually mean? Does it mean that cannot be used in a air-conditioned environment?</p>
","<p>They are saying that the maximum ""wetness"" of the environment should be 85% relative humidity (RH). </p>

<p>As shown on the Psychrometric chart further down, 85% RH is an upper safety limit - air should usually be much dryer than this. At 85% RH you may need a drop in temperature of typically 5 to 10 degrees F to precipitate water out of the air. Not something you usually want to encourage. </p>

<p>Just cooling air will increase its RH (see below)<br>
 <strong>BUT</strong> cooling in an airconditioning system will usually <strong>decrease</strong> RH as the air is usually cooled so much that it comdenses water out of the air inside the air conditioner and then mixes the drier cold air with room air to produce a micture of lower RH than before. </p>

<p>Air can range from fully dry with no water content = 0% relative humidity (very rare) up to fully saturated with water vapor so that it cannot hold any more = 100% relative humidity. </p>

<p>The absolute amount of water in air at a given humidity will vary with temperature (among other things).  As the air is cooled the relative humidity will rise. If temperature continues to fall a point will be reached where RH = 100% and below that temperature water will be ""condensed out"" as liquid water. </p>

<p>As 100% RH is approached any inhomogeneity in the air or temperature  may result in some condensation at some locations so it is safe to stay away from the 100% boundary if it is desired to prevent any condensation occurring. </p>

<p>85% RH is a moderately safe upper limit if liquid water is to be prevented from being precipitated out of the air.</p>

<p>More information available on the technical aspects if desired.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>100% RH can occur in clear air in a normal room or in open air.</strong></p>

<p>In situations where air is relatively moist - possibly near sea or lakes or rivers or after rain, if temperature drops suddenly RH can go to 100% and condensation can occur.<br>
  The classic example is taking a camera from a warm room outside when the outside air temperature is much lower. The misting which instantaneously occurs is condensation from the air. Mechanisms can be discussed as it may not be intuitive. </p>

<p><strong>Some ""light reading"" :-)</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometrics"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia Psychrometrics</a></p>

<p>Consider the chart below. Some of the arrows are somewhat drunken and the graph is not quite square as supplied - minor details which don't affect the points being made. </p>

<p>This is called a ""Psychrometric chart. This tells you more than you want to know about the relationships for moist air between water mass, air mass, temperature, Relative humidity, energy and a few more things. I'll simply explain how it relates to the current question without any explanation of the underlying issues. A very important point will come out of this.</p>

<p>Line A B C D is a line of constant mass of water per mass of dry air. ie during the path from A to D water is not added to or lost from the air.</p>

<p>Point A is the starting point - 98F (98 Fahrenheit) - follow blue arrow down to temperature scale, and 40% Relative Humidity (RH) . This means that the air only holds about 40% of the water it could at this temperature.</p>

<p>The air is now cooled and we follow the path B C D. At B the temperature is ~ 86 F, at C it's 76F and at D it's about 69F. As we go from A to D the RH increases. It's 60% at B, 80% at C and 100% at D. If we cool this air below 69F water will start condensing out.<br>
 You are unlikely to want this air inside your equipment when this happens.</p>

<p><strong>A key point to note is that at 85 RH the temperature is about 75F.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>This is only 6 degrees F above the temperature at which the RH reaches 100% ( = 69F) and water starts condensing out.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Even the original 40% RH = low is only (98-69) = 29 F above condensation point.  </p>

<p>The important points to note are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Even quite dry air can result in liquid water condensation with quite modest drops in temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>While the specification sheet allows for 85% RH non condensing this is an absolute safety limit and RH should be kept much lower. At 85% RH a drop in temperature of around 7 F can cause condensation - even less under some other conditions. (eg about 4 degrees F drop at about 55F.)</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the technical problems associated with the size, </p>

<p>Basically, the larger the aperture is, the larger the angle of light rays on the outside of the lens has to change:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIT4Q.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Look at the image and imagine that D increases while f stays the same - it should be clear that the light rays then need to ""bend"" more. And making optics that refract light rays at large angles without incurring all kinds of distiortions and aberrations is very hard. It requires exotic materials and more lens elements for correction, and of course all of them have to be large because, well, it's all about making that opening larger.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>does it become exponentially more difficult?</p>

<p>If you don't remember the radius, or you truncated the pixel values by working or saving the image as 8 bit (and then used lossy JPEG compression for good measure destroying data further) then standard inverse filtering will fail spectacularly. You will get a slight improvement using a Weiner filter, or other commercial blur reduction tool, but if they're so blurred you can't tell what the pictures are of, then you're out of luck - the information you seek is no longer contained in the images.</p>

"If a lens supports 18mm focal length, is that a wide angle lens?","15013","","<p>If not, what's the difference? A photographic comparison as an example would be great (assuming they are different).</p>
","<p>As a general rule of thumb, in the modern DSLR world that is primarily dominated by Canon and Nikon, focal lengths are stated at their ""when used on 35mm/full-frame body"" values. Focal length is focal length, and doesn't physically change when the imaging medium changes in size, however different sizes of film or sensor do change the effective angle of view that is actually captured. Focal length is a rather useless value, all things being equal, as it doesn't really tell you much of anything about what the lens will do when used on a particular camera. The angle of view is a considerably more useful value, but that can be difficult to calculate given the factors involved. A simpler solution is to determine the angle of view ""bucket"" that your lens falls into for the size of sensor you are using.</p>

<p><strong>On Focal Length, Angle of View, and Sensor Size</strong></p>

<p>The angle of view of a lens of a particular focal length is dependent on the size of the imaging medium. On on a 35mm sensor or film (full-frame sensor, such as what you get with a Canon 1D or 5D, the Nikon D3's), an 18mm DSLR lens is a wide-angle lens. Full-frame bodies are expensive, and most DSLR's come in a variant of APS-C, or cropped-sensor, sizes. Most APS-C sensors are around 22-23mm. The smaller sensor captures less of the image circle projected by the lens, which <em>effectively</em> reduces the angle of view. While the lens is an 18mm focal length lens, on a sensor that is smaller than 35mm, the lens ""behaves"" as though it is a longer focal length. As such, the focal length ranges that determine if a lens is wide, normal, or telephoto change with the size of the sensor.</p>

<p><strong>Common Fields of View @ 35mm</strong></p>

<p>There are some common fields of view, assuming a full frame (35mm) sensor, that can be used to generally group focal lengths. There are slightly differing schools of thought on this, however here is a table from a well-known source, DPReview.com:</p>

<pre><code>Focal Length        Angle of View Bucket
----------------------------------------
&lt; 20mm              Super Wide Angle 
24mm - 35mm         Wide Angle 
50mm                Normal Lens 
80mm - 300mm        Tele
&gt; 300mm             Super Tele
</code></pre>

<p>(From dpreview.com: <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/key=focal+length"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Focal Length</a>)</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, a ""wide-angle is a focal length <em>substantially</em> shorter than the focal length of a normal lens."" A normal focal length is one which closely matches the diagonal of the image medium. In a full-frame 35mm sensor body, the sensor is 36x24mm, which is a diagonal of 43.3mm. The closest common ""normal"" focal length used by most manufatrurers is 50mm, which is pretty close to the 43.3mm diagonal of a full-frame sensor. (Similarly, in large-format photography, the film size is 4""x5"", or 101.6x127mm, which has a diagonal of 163mm. With 4x5 cameras, a ""normal"" focal length lens is usually around 150mm.) While the term <em>substantially</em> in the Wikipedia article is not well-defined, the Wikipedia article cites 35mm and less as ""wide-angle"" and ""ultra-wide-angle"". Similarly, focal lengths substantially longer than a normal lens are ""telephoto"" through ""super-telephoto"" lenses.</p>

<p><strong>Crop Factor and Angle of View</strong></p>

<p>Since the field of view buckets that a lens falls into are dependent on focal length, and effective focal length is dependent on sensor size, one most first determine the effective focal length on a sensor smaller than 35mm. An easy rule of thumb can be used to calculate the effective focal length: Divide the diagonal of a 35mm sensor by the diagonal of the actual sensor, and multiply the resulting number (the ""crop factor"") by the focal length.</p>

<pre><code>cropFactor = fullFrameDiagonal / croppedSensorDiagonal
effectiveFocalLength = actualFocalLength * cropFactor
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you know the diagonals of your camera sensor. The diagonal can be computed fairly easily using the Pythagorean Theorem if you know the width and height of the sensor. Pythagoras' theorem quite simply states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In any right triangle, the area of the
  square whose side is the hypotenuse
  (the side opposite the right angle) is
  equal to the sum of the areas of the
  squares whose sides are the two legs
  (the two sides that meet at a right
  angle).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This translates into the formula:</p>

<pre><code>a^2 + b^2 = c^2
</code></pre>

<p>A sensor, cut in half along its diagonal, <strong>is</strong> a right triangle, and the length of the diagonal (c) can be computed as such:</p>

<pre><code>diagonal = sqrt(width^2 + height^2)
</code></pre>

<p>If you know the dimensions of your sensor, and are not afraid of a little math, you can computer the effective focal length of any lens on any camera body, and once the effective focal length is known, determine whether it is ultra-wide, wide, normal, tele, or super-tele. As it is unlikely most people will know their sensor dimensions, here is convenient a table of sensor sizes, diagonals, and crop factors:</p>

<pre><code>Sensor                   Crop Factor     Diagonal      Width      Height
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4x5 Large Format Film    0.27            162.6mm       127mm   x  101.6mm
Digital Medium Format    0.64            67.1mm        53.7mm  x  40.3mm
Full-Frame               1.0             43.3mm        36mm    x  24mm
Canon APS-H              1.26 (1.3)      34.5mm        28.7mm  x  19.1mm
Pentax/Sony/Nikon DX     1.52 (1.5)      28.4mm        23.7mm  x  15.6mm
Canon APS-C              1.62 (1.6)      26.7mm        22.2mm  x  14.8mm
Sigma Foveon             1.74 (1.7)      24.9mm        20.7mm  x  13.8mm
Four Thirds              2.0             21.6mm        17.3mm  x  13.0mm
</code></pre>

<p>As an example, to demonstrate and prove the concept. The Canon APS-C sensors have a crop factor of 1.6x (most commonly stated, more accurately, 1.62x). This is calculated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>cropFactor = 43.3mm / 26.7mm = 1.6217228...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>APS-C Effective Focal Lengths</strong></p>

<p>Now that you know the crop factor of common sensor sizes, you can compute the effective focal length of any lens you may use. Assuming the 18mm focal length of the original topic, its effective focal length on a Canon APS-C sensor (i.e. 550D, 60D, 7D) would be:</p>

<pre><code>effectiveFocalLength = 1.6 * 18mm = 28.8mm, or 29mm
</code></pre>

<p>You can compute the focal range of a zoom lens just as easily. Given the Nikon 14-24mm lens:</p>

<pre><code>shortFocalLength = 1.5 * 14mm = 21mm
longFocalLength = 1.5 * 24mm = 36mm
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Full Frame vs. APS-C Angle of View Buckets</strong></p>

<p>The most common sensor sizes for many of the most common DSLR cameras are Full Frame and APS-C. We have a table of angle of view buckets for full frame, so it is useful to compute a table that defines the angle of view buckets for APS-C. I've used a crop factor of 1.55 to cover Canon APS-C and Pentax/Sony/Nikon APS-C:</p>

<pre><code>Focal Length        Angle of View Bucket
----------------------------------------
&lt; 12mm              Super Wide Angle 
15mm - 23mm         Wide Angle 
32mm                Normal Lens 
51mm - 200mm        Tele
&gt; 200mm             Super Tele
</code></pre>

<p>Given the two AoV bucket tables, we can arrive at a table of common lenses and their AoV's for both Full Frame and APS-C sensors:</p>

<pre><code>FF Focal Length   FF AoV                 APS-C Focal Length   APS-C AoV

And picture turned out like this: Bottom half of it is black.
I have no idea what has caused this and how to prevent it? I just know that after this I shot a few more frames without flash or only with the camera's built-in flash and they were fine so I know the camera is not broken.
When I read the photo EXIF info this is what I had:
<code>1/400 sec</code> with <code>f 2.8 and 60mm.</code>  My flash is a manual flash and its power was on <code>1/32</code> and zoom on <code>70mm.</code><br>
No specific reason for these numbers, I was only experimenting.
Also I had set the <code>exposure compensation</code> of the camera to <code>-5.00</code> in the hope that it would make the background darker and the foreground look more 3D because of the flash.</p>
","<p>You're shooting with a shutter speed faster than your sync speed (most likely 1/200 or 1/250).  Your camera's shutter consists of two curtains -- the first one opens to begin the exposure, and the second follows it -- closing to end the exposure.  At speeds slower than your camera's sync speed, these two curtain movements allow at least a tiny fraction of time between opening and closing, but at faster shutter speeds, the closing curtain is actually chasing the opening curtain, creating a moving slit of exposure.  A flash occurring during such an exposure is only going to illuminate part of the sensor - hence, the dark bar.</p>

<p>This is a bit tricky to picture, but this video shows exactly what's happening with those curtains:</p>

","<p>Firstly, you should pose your model. There are ways to accentuate parts of the body naturally.  Try posing her arms so that they squeeze the bosom.  Another option then is to break all the rules of portrait photography, and instead of using a long lens (that flattens features) use a wider angle (around 24-35mm on full frame maybe) and get closer!  By getting closer you will bring the features (in this case, bosom) that are in the center of the frame, out, in a more 3D fashion.  You may need to angle upwards a little to see her face too.</p>

Any suggestions on camera settings to improve this picture's colour tone before clicking? If not, could anyone please suggest me the best way to do this via post processing in Lightroom? (I have used exposure settings trying to get the picture right)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ohG8D.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Let's see... When you <em>took</em> the picture, you thought you were looking at something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8n4Cv.jpg"" alt=""badly recooked version of posted original picture""></p>

<p>...and were disappointed to find that what the camera captured was dark, flat and greyish rather than an enhancement of what you saw.</p>

<p>There are two problems with that picture. The first is the difference in brightness between the sky and foreground, which is forcing the earth-bound scene to be rendered a bit too dark. The second is that the colour temperature is too high for your white balance setting (the light is much bluer than your camera is expecting), so the predominant red and yellow tones of the foreground building are desaturated (greyish).</p>

<p>There isn't a lot you can do about the brightness range at capture time. When there is a better, straighter line of demarcation between the bright and dark (as in a landscape with a clear horizon), you can use a split/graduated neutral density filter to darken the bright area selectively, but that isn't practical for this particular picture. It's something that needs to be fixed in post (unless you're shooting JPEGs, in which case your camera may have a setting to bring up the lower midtones and lighter darks).</p>

<p>The second is a matter of getting the right white balance. The presets in the camera only cover a very few common conditions, and ""auto"" sort of depends on your subject matter being a lot like what the camera expects the ""average"" picture to look like. A custom white balance using a grey card can help a lot. So can an <em>enhancing filter</em>, which can boost the red end of the spectrum without really affecting the blues much.</p>

<p>I didn't spend a lot of time on the image -- the object of the game was to try to emulate what you saw with the naked eye rather than to make the image ""pop"". Even at that, though, it took a few tools to get to this point. (I used Photoshop along with Topaz Labs' Adjust 5 and ReMask 3.2 because I have them, but they're hardly the only game in town.) The foreground was processed separately (on a different layer) from the sky, water and the distant shoreline. Both layers had a light enhancement of local contrast and had the exposure adjustments needed to get that part of the image right. I then masked the sky out of the foreground image, allowing the adjusted sky to show through. Unlike a typical overall HDR effect, this masking technique doesn't result in obvious halos.</p>

<p>It may sound like a lot of work, but the ""HDR"" (local contrast enhancement) part of the job was done using single-click presets, and the masking job doesn't have to be anything like perfect. It's not like I was replacing the background -- I just didn't want the sky to have the same adjustments as the foreground. Total time? Less than two minutes. It wouldn't have taken much longer to make it really pop, but it's <em>your</em> picture, so you get to make the decisions.</p>

"What laptop specs are important for intensive image editing work?","14754","","<p>How important is the following in purchasing a laptop that will be used for image editing:</p>

<ul>
<li>processor speed</li>
<li>amount of RAM</li>
<li>integrated vs. dedicated graphics card</li>
<li>HD speed (SSD; or 5400/7200/10000 rpm)</li>
</ul>
","<p>They are all important.  But they are all inter-related, so it is best to have a balanced system.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a lot of RAM, you will hold more in memory, and do less paging (to disk), so the HD will be in use less often, and so HD speed would be less important.  If you skimp on RAM, and don't have enough, the HD will be used more, data will be fetched more slowly to the processor, so having a super fast processor may be wasted because you have a bottleneck in your memory/storage and the processor is idle waiting on data.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have a good graphics card it may take some of the workload off the processor, making raw processor speed less important.</p>

<p>On a laptop, I think the main place you can gain performance improvement is in a good dedicated graphics card.</p>

<p>Next most important would probably be RAM.  I have 8GB and doing heavy editing in CS6 that seems to be enough.  16GB might give some incremental improvement, but I expect 8GB is enough.</p>

<p>The HD speed will help files/thumbnails load more quickly, and speed up paging, but I think it's the least important, especially if you have sufficient RAM.</p>

<p>Processor speed I think depends on the software you use.  Some make better use of multiple cores than others.  The speed (GHz) isn't as important as how many cores, and whether you can take advantage of them.</p>

<p>There is an in-depth discussion of these on the Adobe site: <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/crawlspace/2012/10/how-to-tune-photoshop-cs6-for-peak-performance.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to tune Photoshop CS6 for peak performance</a></p>

"Technically, why is the out of focus area blurred more when using a bigger aperture?","14699","","<p>I'm wondering, technically, why and how does the out of focus areas blur more when using a bigger aperture. I think it'd help a lot if I presented a problem that's been driving me nuts for a long time:</p>

<p>I've read that the f-number of the human eye varies from about f/8.3 in very bright light to about f/2.1 in the dark. But from what I've tested, I always see out-of-focus areas with the same amount of blur.</p>

<p>Which leads me to ask: how does this aperture thing work, why does it create a blur from the technical point of view, and does it also apply to eyes, or is it just a ""failure"" in the camera lenses we've come to like and never wanted to ""fix""?</p>
","<p>I'm going to crib from <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/49/what-is-aperture-and-how-does-it-affect-my-photograph/6614#6614"">my answer to an earlier question on aperture</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the aperture is very small, the admitted light is highly ""collimated"", which is a fancy way of saying ""all the rays are nicely parallel to each other"". This results in a sharp focus for all the light that comes in. When the aperture is more open, only the rays which closely match the focus point are collimated — which means that whatever you've focused on is sharp, but farther or closer parts of the scene will be increasingly blurry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the smaller the aperture, the more restricted-to-exactly-in-focus the light is. A bigger aperture lets in more light, but the ""price"" is that it's less controlled.</p>

<p>The following diagram from Wikimedia may help:</p>

<p><a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diaphragm.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOlux.png"" alt=""File by wikipedia user Chabacano, licensed CC-BY-SA 3.0""></a></p>

<p>On the left, the wide aperture results in only the center, focused ♡ card rendered sharply. The more-narrow aperture on the right excludes the less-collimated light from the out-of-focus ♠ and ♣ cards, resulting in a sharper image overall.</p>

<p>Remember, the red/green/blue dotted lines in the diagram trace the outside of a cone of light rays. The more-focused light is <em>also</em> included in the image made with the wider aperture on the left, but the image sensor (or film) can't tell which was which, so the result is more blur except for the rays which happen to be precisely at the focal point.</p>

<p>This surely happens with the human eye as a lens as well. I think it's just really hard to control your experiment, since you can't actually snap a picture to compare side by side. In the time between evening and midday — or even in the half hour it takes your eyes to acclimate to a dark room — you lose the perfect memory of how much blur there was. This is further complicated by the fact that your brain is working very hard to correct all defects from the eyes and present a mental model of the entire world in perfect focus. (That's what the brain part of the human vision system <em>does</em>.)</p>

<p>It's very hard to look at just one spot; your eye flicks around subconsciously, and builds a perfect image from one which is really only sharp in the center. This adds another huge complication — not only is the lens of the eye a relatively simple system with a lot of aberrations, the <em>sensor</em> is irregular. Or rather, it's highly specialized. The central area is called the <em>fovea</em>, and that's only about 1mm in diameter — and the <em>most sharp</em> part, the <em>foveola</em>, is only 0.2mm. That's where really sharp vision comes from. But this area doesn't contain any rods (the cells sensitive to dim light), so this sharp area is not involved at all when you're in dim light. This makes a simple comparison with camera systems basically impossible.</p>

<p>On top of that, there's another flaw in your basic assumptions — the idea that the human eye sees the same amount of motion blur no matter the amount of light. Actually, the input is actually integrated over time, and the <a href=""http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/temporal-resolution/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amount of time does increase in lower light levels</a>. And, ""exposure"" is actually controlled in another way: the sensitivity is boosted in the darkness — the effective equivalent of auto-ISO. </p>

<p><strong>So, to get to the direct question:</strong> it's the nature of optics, and so it also applies to our eyes. But our eyes are a different kind of system than a camera and lens. The human vision system features a simple lens, a complicated sensor, very complicated instantaneous post-processing, and an incredibly complicated storage and retrieval system. A camera generally uses a sophisticated lens, a <em>comparatively</em> straightforward sensor matrix, and <em>comparatively</em> straightforward post-processing (until computational photography comes into its own — whether Lytro succeeds this year or someone else five years from now). And the memory system is bit-for-bit perfect — not like human memory in the least.</p>

<p>Whether this difference is something we ""like"" and don't want to fix is a matter of interpretation. Certainly the idea of depth of field is in our artistic/visual vocabulary as a society; whether it will stay that way in a hundred years is a matter of speculation. My guess is <em>yes</em>, even as technology changes.</p>

<p>A camera with a different type of sensor, like that used in the <a href=""https://www.lytro.com/science_inside#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lytro</a> can actually record the <em>direction</em> of the incoming rays of light. This additional data allows these cameras to create an entirely-sharp image even with a very large aperture.

"How to create the equivalent of an Adjustment Layer in an editor that does not support it?","14656","","<p>As a user of GIMP I tried to understand what Photoshop's Adjustment Layers are, without actually using PS. My understanding is that GIMP does not yet support AL (is this correct?).</p>

<p>So, trying to imitate the effect of an AL, is it equivalent to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplicate the image to a second layer.</li>
<li>Apply the desired effect (filter/adjustment/whatever) to the new layer.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>layer mask</strong> to the 2nd layer and set its transparency areas the same way you'd do with AL, this blending the adjusted image with the original image in the desired areas/amounts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I thinking right?</p>

<p>I realize that there is one limitation to that method - changes to the original image layer will not affect the top layer (AL equivalent). Is there a way to lock the two images in the two layers?</p>
","<p>In short, no. What you're doing is not really related. Layer masks are basically ways of working with the alpha channel of a layer. Adjustment layers aren't really layers at all — they're ways of thinking of filters within the same metaphor. They don't actually accomplish anything you couldn't do simply by applying the filters in the traditional way. However, because the layers model is very powerful, they are a convenient and powerful tool which makes visual experimentation easier.</p>

<p>The problem is that ""apply the desired effect"" is a destructive operation for the layer you apply it to — if you want to change the parameters of that effect, you have to do something to reverse it. Generally, that means recreating the whole layer. Layer masks let you choose how ""strongly"" to apply an effect, and limit it to certain parts of the image, but they don't change that basic limitation.</p>

<p>In terms of final results, there's nothing you can do with adjustment layers that you <em>can't</em> do just by deleting and recreating the layer every time. The problem is that if you're trying to work with the combination of multiple different adjustments (for example, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/13166/how-can-i-approximate-soft-focus-digitally/13170#13170"">blur <em>and</em> curves</a>), it becomes tedious.</p>

<p>So, it's basically an ease-of-workflow thing, and since you can combine multiple layers, for complicated operations it can be <em>exponentially</em> easier — nothing to sneeze at.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the <a href=""http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gimp development roadmap</a> has something called ""Filter layers (brightness/contrast, blur, etc)"" as relatively high priority.

<p>For example, if your have 3 files <code>a.jpg</code>, <code>b.jpg</code>, <code>c.jpg</code>, to align them you may run:</p>

<pre><code>align_image_stack -a aligned_ a.jpg b.jpg c.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>which will produce three TIFF images, <code>aligned_0000.tif</code>, <code>aligned_0001.tif</code> and <code>aligned_0002.tif</code>, which will be well aligned. Now the images are ready to be, for instance, enfused:</p>

<pre><code>enfuse aligned_*.tif
</code></pre>

<p>If you prefer the graphical interface, or you want to align only partially overlapping images (like in panoramas), then use Hugin itself, it is a very powerful and flexible software.</p>

<h3>Alignment of stereo pairs</h3>

<p>From your comments I see, that you want to create stereoscopic images. The keyword to search for is <em>anaglyph</em>, not <em>align</em>.</p>

<p>For this purpose I used <a href=""http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stereo Photo Maker</a>, which is not open source, just a free Windows program. It runs well under <code>wine</code> too. But I almost never used its automatic alignment feature, because I prefer to align images manually, watching the composite 3D image. By aligning the images manually I can also choose what exactly is “in focus” (one cannot align everything in a stereo image).</p>

<p>SPM can also optimize color anaglyphs to reduce ghosting, a very useful feature.</p>

<p>There are some scripts and tutorials for Gimp (e.g. <a href=""http://cstein.kings.cam.ac.uk/~chris/mposplit/anaglypher.scm"" rel=""noreferrer"">anaglypher</a>, <a href=""http://registry.gimp.org/node/6527"" rel=""noreferrer"">script-fu-make-anaglyph</a>, <a href=""http://www.crystalxp.net/forum/en/Graphic-Tutorials/Miscellaneous-graphic-Tutorials/sujet_20570_1.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this short tutorial</a>). It is relatively easy to build a monochrome anaglyph through layer effects and by moving a layer manually, it is not always working well for color anaglyphs.</p>

Do professional shops that want long term storage use magnetic drives or blu-ray discs? Is there a reason <em>not</em> to use blu-ray discs for photography? Would accessing photos off of a blu-ray disc be faster or the same(<em>i.e. slow</em>) as a DVD? Is this question and its answers identical if I was asking about DVDs?</p>
","<p>The simple fact of the matter is that we don't know how good writable Blu-Ray discs are yet -- there isn't sufficient data to say whether or not they'll stand the test of time. Accelerated aging tests can only get you so far. They certainly make a degree of practical sense in terms of cost, shipping, and so forth, but as a long-term solution, right now, you would have to be willing to engage in a rigorous program of periodic disc duplication in order to stave off any potential ""bit rot"". At least until the medium is proven, or its archival qualities are properly understood. (And I's stick to single-layer, since clouding -- obstructing the deeper layer -- is one of the more probable failure modes.)</p>

<p>Of course, the same can be said for any digital storage medium. Magnetic domains aren't forever either, so periodic rewriting is essential. Then there's always the question of long-term readability -- there was a time when ZIP disks and magneto-optical storage sounded like a good idea, but now we have the problem of sourcing readers for those disks. How long will it be before it becomes the next best thing to impossible to find an interface for an EIDE/PATA hard drive? SCSI? When will SATA be superceded? Or USB? Even file formats change over time, so there's no real guarantee than twenty years down the road your files will still be readable (this will be less of a problem for well-entrenched formats like JPEG or TIFF than with any proprietary format, but you never know). </p>

<p>The advantage to magnetic storage is that the storage capacity of individual drives is much larger than optical disks, so when you need to re-archive (and you <em>will</em> need to) there's a lot less donkey work involved in the process. I'd much rather swap 1TB hard drives than 25GB optical discs any day.</p>

"What is the difference between DX format and FX format lenses, and which to choose for what purpose?","14590","","<p><a href=""http://www.nikon.co.in/products.php?categoryid=1011"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.nikon.co.in/products.php?categoryid=1011</a></p>

<p>What is the difference between DX format and FX format lenses, and which to choose for what purpose?</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of both?</p>
","<ul>
<li><p>A FX lens is deigned to properly project an image onto an FX sensor - say 36mm x 24 mm nominal</p></li>
<li><p>A DX lens is designed to properly project an image onto a DX sensor say 18mm x 24 mm or half the area of an FX sensor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Actual sensor sizes vary with manufacturer and even amongst sensors from the same manufacturer but the above is close enough or discussion.</p>

<p>A DX lens mounted on an FX body will usually not fully illuminate an FX sensor (usually it will at least vignette in the corners. But even if it does apparently fully illuminate the larger sensor it will not have been designed to perform well over such a wide area and the results at the edges can be expected to be bad.</p>

<p>If you use an FX lens on a DX body the middle half of the AREA of the lens will be used. This tends to have better performance (superior MTF etc) so use of an FX lens with a DX sensor usually improves sharpness and contrast. However, there are sometimes reports of a given FX lens working worse with DX sensors.</p>

<p>FX lenses are usually spec for spec, heavier , larger and substantially more expensive than a same spec DX lens. If you have a DX sensor system you may gain very little by using an FX lens of the same spec but the weight and cost and size be larger.<br>
 If your aim is to impress wit your musculature, disposable income and carrying power the FX lens may be better but otherwise may not be worth the difference in cost.</p>

<p>If you have a DX sensor system and buy FX lenses they will wok on an FX sensor if you upgrade (assuming same manufacturer /lens mount.) BUT if you buy DX lenses and upgrade they will not be suited to the FX system. The partial exception is that some FX cameras will accept DX lens and will mask out the outer half area of the sensor so that the lens and sensor act as if they are a full DX system. An examples is the Nikon D700 which provides 12 MP with an FX lens and 6MP with an DX lens.</p>

<p>A DX camera will image a lesser  target area than a FX camera with the same lens because the lens still projects the same image onto the sensor location in each case BUT the DX sensor only occupies half the area being projected onto. Thus 100% of the DX sensor image consists of less target area than does 100% of the FX sensor image. This leads to the typical APS crop factor - typically but not always = 1.5 for APSC cameras. </p>

<p>This leads to effective focal length being multiplied by the crop factor. So a 50mm lens becomes 75mm, an 18mm becomes 27mm and a 500mm mirror lens becomes 750mm. This can be good and bad. A 50mm lens is usually bought because it is the classic prime lens. An f1.4, 0r 1.7 or 1.8 or all 3 are available from every major lens manufacturer. BUT on an APSC camera the 50mm becomes 75mm and the photographic perspectives are quite different. To get 35mm effective on an APSC camera an 33.33 mm would notionally be used and a 35mm is the usual nearest offering. The 500mm mirror becomes 750mm and this is usually acceptable. The 188mm wideangle becomes a 27mm semi wideangle - an entirely different appearance. The crop factor affects FX and DX lenses equally when used on a DX camera BUT which is used may affect future decisions. eg a DX camera owner may desire a 50mm f1.x prime. 50mm pries are almost always FX lenses, even when sold for DX use. On reason for this is that they are often legacy lenses based on glass designs which may have been tweaked a little but is still something from the film days. This often makes then even better on a DX system that uses only the lens centre but leads to upgrade agonisings. </p>

<p>If they have no intention of upgrading to an FX system then a 35mm may well be purchased to get the 50mm equivalent effect. If a DX to FX upgrade is envisaged at some stage then the choice is 50mm which acts like a 75mm now and like an 50mm with FX, OR a 35mm now which acts like a 50mm now and a 35mm with FX senor. Give the choice of 35mm FX or 50mm FX the 50mm would usually be the clear first choice for FX users and the 35mm for DX users unless the later sensor upgrade option was of importance. </p>

"Best portrait lens for canon 7d that gives beautiful bokeh?","14583","","<p>I tried using the 70-200mm but I couldn't stand how heavy it was and how far away I had to be from the model!  Opinions? I was thinking between 85mm 1.2 or 50mm 1.2 ....or another lens?  Any help would be much appreciated!  I've been researching for weeks but everyone says they are both decent lenses! </p>
","<p>There really isn't a ""right length"" for a portrait lens -- there's a ""right distance"" for a portrait shot. The ""right lens"", then, is the one that lets you frame the picture the way you want when shooting from the right distance.</p>

<p>A 70-200mm lens is a great fashion/beauty lens on a full-frame camera (like the 5D); you can stand at a distance that's very flattering to the model and crop in tight on just the face. On a 1.6x crop factor camera (like the 7D), you've either got to be quite a distance away, or crop in very, very tightly.</p>

<p>The 50mm and 85mm lenses fall well within the bounds of traditional portrait-length lenses on a crop-sensor camera. The 50mm fills about the same role as the 85mm lens would in the traditional full-frame world; the 85mm hits about the same spot as the traditional 135mm lens. I can't say a lot about the <em>quality</em> of the bokeh of either of those lenses (I haven't been a Canon user since the manual focus F1n went out of production, so you'll have to rely on online reviews like those at <a href=""http://www.photozone.de/canon-eos"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">photozone.de</a>), but I can tell you that there will be sufficient <em>quantity</em> of bokeh with either lens. Which one you'd choose depends on the kinds of pictures you want to take. The 50mm is good for half-figure or better; the 85mm is better suited for head-and-shoulder, but it's also great for full-figure shots if you have the room. And do yourself a favour by taking a look at the 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.8 lenses, since they offer a significantly reduced depth of field for a <em>lot</em> less money than the f/1.2 lenses, and might be all you relly need.</p>

<p>For a very tight head crop, you might want to go a little longer than either lens -- and you might find that the 135mm f/2.8SF (soft focus) lens, which is a sharp lens when the SF is dialed to 0, is a versatile addition to your kit. When soft focus is right, it's right, and the effect from a proper soft-focus lens is better than what you can do in post.</p>
","14042"
"What is the difference between depth of field and focal plane?","14566","","<p>I would like to know how to address the difference between them and how relates to each other.</p>
","<p>The focal plane is the distance from the camera at which the sharpest focus is attained. Depth of field is the range of distances either side at which the focus is ""acceptably sharp"".</p>

<p>The ""acceptably sharp"" part is what causes confusion as you need to make assumptions about viewing distance and visual acuity. For this reason a standard figure for the amount of blur that is acceptable tends to be used. It's thus important to realise that any depth of field numbers are approximate, suitable for comparison (i.e. this setup gives DOF of X meters, this setup gives DOF of Y meters) but the actual range that appears sharp will likely differ.</p>

<p>For lenses which exhibit a defect known as field curvature, the focal plane wont be flat but will curve outward, meaning when photographing something dead flat you could end up with the centre sharp but the corners out of focus.</p>

<p>Tilt-shift lenses allow you to tilt the focal plane relative the camera to better suit the subject (for example tilting the focal plane down would help you get more of the ground in focus).</p>

"Does a photographer take pictures or make pictures?","14560","","<p>Most people speak of the process of photography as <strong>taking</strong> pictures. However, many serious photographers instead refer to <strong>making</strong> pictures.</p>

<p>One might be inclined to dismiss this as jargon, but there's clearly a difference in attitude. ""Making"" implies a creative process, whereas ""taking"" has negative connotations: appropriation, or even stealing. Or, not so negative: ""to capture the moment""; the ability of a photograph to extract the essence of a scene, preserve it, and share it. But to flip back again, can one really do this well without also making something new? Even when the scene isn't staged, the photographer has some level of authorial responsibility.</p>

<p>So, the question: is <em>taking</em> really so bad? Does it inherently mean thoughtlessness, and rapid-fire snapshots? Should every genuine photographer be encouraged to engage in <em>making</em>? Or can taking photographs as observation alone be a valid, serious form of the art?</p>
","<p>I think each process has equal merit, just based on my own experience of doing a Project 365. Doing that project, with an express goal of not being overly repetitive, I've had to do a lot of different things and that really means both taking and making pictures:</p>

<p><strong><em>Taking</em></strong></p>

<p>This, to me, is the art of seeing the moment and <em>taking</em> it. Perhaps the jargon doesn't really imply this, but that is how I see it. Henri Cartier-Bresson was the master of this sort of thing, holding onto ordinary moments in time in such a way as to enspire and educate us. He didn't create the picture, he saw it, and captured it. This, I think, is the essence of <em>taking</em> a picture. Candid photography or photojournalism really falls into this and to master it means having an eye for the moment.</p>

<p>Now, the negative connotation on this would probably be the snapshot style, basically just capturing an image with out concept of framing, light, obstructions, etc. This is, in some ways, the classic tourist shooting I suppose and forms the basis for differentiating casual shooters versus advanced amateurs or pros.</p>

<p><strong><em>Making</em></strong></p>

<p>In this end of the spectrum, it's about putting the conditions in place for the image. It's about creating the lighting, or observing the lighting, and positioning for the image you know is to come. It can be as detailed and controlled as the almost cinematic work of Dave Hill or as studied and patient of the work of Ansel Adams. This is where the fine art, landscape, and similar works fall into and, to master this, you need to have the ability to envision the result and prepare for it.</p>

<p>For making a shot, the negative connotation, to me, is the complete setup does everything for you. For example, you can buy devices such as the StopShot that, once everything is set up, does <em>all</em> the work, including triggering the shutter. It's basically turn everything on and let it go to work and you'll see this often with water drops. Don't get me wrong, the images can be great, but to me it loses something when the finger isn't on the shutter, a machine is.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, I'm obviously not putting my meagre efforts into the same class as some of the masters I've listed, but I think I've tried to do both of these at various times. To be honest, I think I've had more success at making pictures, controlling the conditions of the outcome, but taking pictures is also fun and rewarding, the element of surprise can be a bonus. Exercising both modes can, I think, make you a better all around photographer. At the very least, I think it makes for more fun. :)</p>

"What makes a camera 'weather sealed'?","14547","","<p>What is the structural and mechanical differences between a weather sealed body and a non weather sealed body? Is weather sealing still effective if the lens isn't weather sealed?</p>
","<p><strong>Weather Sealing</strong> is protection of the internal parts of a camera from external influences such as moisture, dust, and humidity.  The degree of this weather sealing varies between manufacturers and also within models by each manufacturer. </p>

<p>The protection is provided by both rubber sealing with silicon rings and gaskets as well as design considerations such as interlocking panels and pool resistant exterior pieces. Most obviously buttons such as the shutter release will be designed with either a rubber housing beneath them, or a gasket to prevent the entry of the elements. Sealing is not provided by a single piece of hardware. I have often seen values such as 60-70 silicon rings being used in a typical DSLR body for weather sealing, and 30-40 being used in a battery grip for example.</p>

<p>Weather sealing in all but the most high end professional serious cameras is a relatively new occurrence in the consumer market. One can now commonly find weather sealing even in cameras costing under $1,000 USD if you look for the right models.</p>

<p>Commonly weather sealing considerations are limited to moisture from weather such as rain, snow, humidity, and also dust and sand. I would argue that weather sealing does not end at that, but also includes anything that protects the camera from usage and keeps it working as designed. With this in mind I would also consider features such as magnesium-alloy chassis design, shock protection, shielding against electromagnetic interference, stronger shutter mechanisms, sensor dust resistance, carbon-fiber lip on lens ends, and even special fluorine coatings on the low-pass filters as all being components of weather sealing.</p>

<h2>Camera Bodies</h2>

<p>Weather sealing is added during manufacturing, either as additional components in the design, or as <em>part of</em> the design of the camera. The best way to understand exactly what you get with weather sealing is to look at a diagram example from a camera, showing a cross section of the body with the added weather sealing components:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTvCO.jpg"" alt=""Canon 7D Sealing""></p>

<hr>

<p><sup>¹ Image via <a href=""http://usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products/professional_cameras/digital_slr_cameras/eos_7d#Features"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon USA</a></sup></p>

<p>The seals and gaskets highlighted in this image of a Canon 7D is what is considered the weather sealing. </p>

<p>Weather sealing can be described as John Carlson from Pentax <a href=""http://www.thephoblographer.com/2013/02/14/how-a-lens-becomes-weather-sealed/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">described at thephoblographer.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The seals that involve moving parts are constructed from a more elastic material than that used for fixed parts.” says Carlson. “By using a different material we can ensure it operates smoothly while maintaining its seal from dust and moisture.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Lenses</h2>

<p>You hinted at another good point which is how lenses play into the weather sealing equation. A camera body can be weather sealed, but if you add in a lens that is not, that in essence will compromise the integrity of the body weather sealing. Water could enter through the mount in these cases, and the gaskets and rings in the body design will not prevent this. With this in mind, to complete the weather sealing package you will want to look for a lens that is weather sealed as well. Some lenses(not all) require the addition of a front filter element to complete the weather sealing. Keep this in mind when purchasing weather sealed lenses and read the specifications to ensure you are equipping yourself properly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chuck Westfall, Advisor for Technical Information at Canon USA states that, “Canon EF lenses that have been enhanced with countermeasures for dust and water resistance are typically equipped with rubber gaskets and seals at key points.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John Carlson, Sr. Marketing Manager: “Our weather sealed lenses contain a silicon rubber material which is inserted in between each externally exposed part to ensure it is properly sealed against moisture and dust.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found a particularly <a href=""http://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2013/01/24-70mm-f2-8-lens-teardown-comparison"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interesting note</a> about weather sealing of lenses from Roger Cicala, Owner of LensRentals.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I’ve never been very impressed by anyone’s weather sealing. A rubber gasket at the lens mount, waterproof tape over the holes under the rubber, that’s about it. I can see that it would tend to keep water droplets from working their way inside the lens but I can’t imagine them surviving a steady rain – watersealed or not. I haven’t noted any difference in Canon, Nikon, or Olympus high end lenses.""</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Flash Units</h2>

<p>Weather sealing doesn't end at camera bodies and lenses. Even external flash units can be weather sealed. The <a href=""http://www.learn.usa.canon.com/resources/articles/2012/speedlite_600exrt_whats_new.htmlp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon Speedlite 600EX-RT</a> for example has quite extensive weather sealing. It has a level of weather sealing that matches the moisture- and dust-resistance of the EOS-1D X camera body.</p>

<p><sup>¹ Image via <a href=""http://www.learn.usa.canon.com/resources/articles/2012/speedlite_600exrt_whats_new.htmlp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon</a></sup></p>

<p>An interesting development as of recently is that some pop up flash units on DSLR's are also now considered weather sealed. Historically this has been a failure point of weather sealing, but some how Pentax has been now offering DSLR's that are weather sealed and also have pop up flashes.</p>

<h2>Caution</h2>

<p>Weather sealing does not mean weather proof. It is uncommon for manufacturers to guarantee any performance based on the sealing. If a camera notes that it is weather sealed, you can be more confident using that equipment in inclement weather such as light rain or snow. Some models exhibit fantastic sealing and can be submerged in water for a time and still perform without issues. Other weather sealed models can fail even after a light spray of mist. I would advise caution unless you are certain that the sealing is sufficient in your conditions, and even then a bit of common sense can go a long way.</p>

<p>It was mentioned above, but I will mention it again here - if you use a non weather sealed lenses with a weather sealed body, you are risking a failure. The inverse is also true, using a sealed lens on a non sealed body can be troublesome. It is recommended to use a fully sealed kit including body and lenses when the conditions deem weather sealing necessary.</p>

<p>Connecting external adapters and or cables can also compromise the sealing. The connection of a USB, HDMI, PC, or other connector can force the opening of a protective cover that would then expose the camera body to external forces. Another issue can be battery grips, that typically require the opening of the battery door to insert the grip. Not all battery grips are weather sealed, and even those that are can negatively impact the weather sealing performance of the camera body.</p>

"What are major differences between Nikon D series?","14534","","<p>I am not sure if this was asked here before. </p>

<p>In my country, due to taxes, cameras are really expensive, so we have to buy abroad. Since I have no knowledge on what model to buy, I would like to know which cameras do you recommend, and what are the major difference between the D series (D3100, D5100, D7000, and so on). </p>
","<p>For specification differences, the comment you got probably refers to <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/camera_compare.php?model%5B%5D=10&amp;model%5B%5D=9&amp;model%5B%5D=11&amp;model%5B%5D=243&amp;model%5B%5D=341&amp;model%5B%5D=15&amp;compare="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this comparison</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a complete beginner and this does not mean anything to you, then you will need to understand more general concepts about digital cameras and DSLRs as described in my <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/guide_camera_basics.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">camera</a> and <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/guide_dslr_basics.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSLR</a> guides.</p>

<p>In brief, specifically about Nikon DSLRs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The D3X, D3S and D700 are all full-frame models which are known the the utmost image quality. The compromise is that the D3X has high-resolution to make larger prints while the D3S and D700 have better sensitivity to shoot in lower-light conditions, so you have to make a compromise depending on the type of photography you intend to do. The same will be true when you <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/guide_lens_basics.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">choose lenses</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The D7000 and below are cropped sensor models. They are somewhat smaller and require smaller lenses and are less expensive. While in absolute terms you will hear image quality to be lower than full-frame models, they are still very good.</p></li>
<li><p>Among cropped sensor the D7000 (and D300S &amp; D90 before it) are considered professional models and give direct and efficient access to photographic controls. This is absolutely essential to work fast. Of course, whether to work fast is important depends on the type of photography you intend to do. If you shoot weddings and events, consider this essential. The D7000 and full-frame models are also weather-sealed which lets you use them in rain, snow, sandstorms, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally the D5100 and D3100 are low-end models and cheaper but this does <em>not</em> mean less quality images, only lesser quality camera (not at solid, not weather-resistant) and less controls (more often you have to go into the menu). If you shoot a lot of images, then these models become very frustration (D5100 particularly) because they slow you down.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are lots more differences obviously but this should cover the major ones for beginners.</p>

"How do I properly position a lens hood?","14520","","<p>I understand the basic idea of a lens hood, but after looking at mine and contemplating how to use it, I get stuck on the same question every time:</p>

<p>Does the orientation of the hood on the lens matter?  Because the hood has peaks and valleys, so how do you know how to position it to reduce flare and distortions?</p>

<p>Or am I over thinking this, and it has no effect how its positioned on the lens at all?</p>
","<p>The hood has peaks and valleys because the image is rectangular and thus has a wider field of view horizontally than vertically. The cutouts are needed to prevent the hood vignetting (casting shadows) in the corners.</p>

<p>Basically if you imagine a cone getting slowly wider, and then you punch the <em>view frustum</em> through it (to prevent any occlusion of light making up the image)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/20050411/Figure2.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/20050411/Figure2.jpg</a></p>

<p>then you get the shape of a traditional ""petal"" lens hood.</p>

<p><strong>The correct orientation is with the larger peaks at the top and bottom and the smaller peaks at the side</strong>.</p>

<p>You tend to see petal shaped hoods more on zooms and wide angle lenses. The reason for this is that the petal shape is more efficient compared to a traditional round hood. On a wide lens a round hood would have to be very stubby to avoid getting in the way of the image, whereas a petal can extend into areas which don't affect the image to offer additional shading. </p>

<p>Zooms, even in the telephoto range (such as the 70-200) usually have petal hoods for the extra efficiency as the hood on a zoom has to be designed to accommodate the widest focal length. Generally you want the hood as tight as possible without getting in the way of the image, thus a hood designed for 70mm is not as useful when you're zoomed in to 200mm, here the extra shading of the petal design helps.</p>

<p>Prime lenses have hoods designed and optimised for a single focal length so they are as tight as possible, thus petal designs are often replaced by round hoods which are more compact and cheaper to make (unless they are really needed, in the case of wide primes).</p>

"What are the pros and cons of lab prints versus using a printer?","14499","","<p>As newcomers to photography and printing we would like advice on the best way(s), regarding both quality and cost, of printing.
In the main my wife is photographing birds and insects, so natural colour and clarity are paramount. I have had one recommendation to a previous question for a photo lab (Photobox), thanks James.
I was just wondering if any one else can give me advise?</p>
","<p>Jrista's article is an excellent explanation of the cost of making these prints.  It's actually quite a bit cheaper than I'd expected.</p>

<p>I'm just starting to make my own prints using my new Canon Pixma Pro9000 printer.  I must say the results are stunningly beautiful and pop out of the printer with very little effort once I figured out how to load the paper.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of notes on cost that are worth noting.</p>

<p>First, if you are willing to settle for the Pro9000 instead of the Pro9500, it can be had very inexpensively if you check the ""used"" area of Amazon.  Just look for the Pro9000 in Amazon and note the ""new and used from $199"" part of the page.</p>

<p>What you will find is that there is a whole secondary market in these machines thanks to the $400 rebate provided with the purchase of the printer with a new Canon DSLR.  It turns out a lot of people want these rebates and then resell the printers once the rebates are collected.  So even if you are a Nikon shooter like me, you can easily buy these printers for about $250 delivered.  This makes the Pro9000, in my opinion, an unbeatable deal for anyone who has even a marginal desire to own a great photo printer.</p>

<p>A major benefit of printer ownership is that the marginal cost of making a print goes way down.  Take Jrista's example of someone who buys the printer and uses it once a month.  His first print, including the monthly amortization of the printer cost, costs $10 (if we count the printer as costing $250 instead of $700+ as in his example).  But any subsequent print he wants to make costs only about $6 ($3 for paper and $2.80 for ink).  A print from a lab will cost about $13, so he is actually paying much less than what a lab would cost, as long as he makes at least one print a month.</p>

<p>A reasonable scenerio in my case might be to give prints as Christmas gifts to ten of my friends, and then printing one print a month for the rest of the year.  This would mean I would make about 22 prints in a year.  If I amortize my printer over three years, that's $83 a year, plus $127 for making the 22 prints.  So it costs me a bit over $200 a year, or less than $10 per print.  This is considerably cheaper than a photo lab, and my prints come out of the printer instantly, which is partiuclarly useful during the Christmas season when photo labs are bound to be very busy and thus slow.</p>

<p>One really interesting consequence of purchasing your printer is that you should really act as though the printer didn't cost anything at all when making your calculations.  Why?  Because you should encourage yourself to make prints whenever you have even the slightest desire for them.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that if you leave your printer idle for long periods, you are risking ink clogging, which uses a lot of ink to resolve.  You would be better off using this ink to make prints!  Unless you are printing photos for a living, it's highly unlikely that you can overload your printer's duty cycle.  </p>

<p>So don't say your print cost $10 including the cost of the printer.  Say it costs under $6, and make as many prints as you would want to have at that price.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I found Canon's Photo Paper Platinum at $12.99 per 10 sheets, including shipping.  So my paper costs about $1.30 and my ink (presumably from his example) around $2.80.  So my 13x19 print costs only about $4.10.  Your mileage may vary, as always, but look around for deals and you may find photo printing considerably cheaper than you might think.</p>

"What can Aperture or Lightroom do that Picasa or iPhoto can't?","14498","","<p>I just upgraded from a point-and-shoot to an interchangeable lens camera.</p>

<p>I was wondering if I should also consider Aperture or Lightroom rather than Picasa, but I don't have a good idea of what Aperture or Lightroom can do that Picasa or iPhoto can't, so I wanted to ask.</p>

<p>I'd like something simple and quick and easy to understand, rather than complex and time-consuming.</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like a tool that automatically scans my hard disc (or, more precisely, scans folders I choose, recursively) and keeps it in sync with the library, like Picasa does, and unlike iTunes or iPhoto, which require me to manually add folders or files to the app, and then delete them from the app when I delete them from the disc.</p>

<p>But my main question is: what can Aperture or Lightroom do that Picasa or iPhoto can't?</p>
","<p>Lightroom gives you a lot <strong>more control over the processing of your images</strong>. You can finely tune vignetting (add and remove), curves, sharpening, split-toning, adding clarity, removing chromatic aberrations, powerful noise reduction, de-warping (lens distortions and perspective) ""selective editing"" (e.g. change the saturation/luminance of one color only, or of one area). </p>

<p>As opposed to Picasa which only does desaturation, it's really powerful when it comes to <strong>black and white</strong>, you can finely control each color separately, as if you were using color filters on your camera (as was often done when using b&amp;w film).</p>

<p>Lightroom is also extremely efficient a <strong>recovering details in the shadows and in the highlights</strong>. From a RAW file, you can go from a totally white or black picture, to something decent. Recovery is something where Picasa falls short. And when you have a really nicely composed shot, it's nice to be able to fix some lighting mistakes.</p>

<p>Lightroom has a lot more features when it comes to printing, making slideshows and galleries, and most importantly <strong>organizing large sets of pictures</strong> (tags, metadata, flags, stars). It is extremely convenient when selecting/deleting shots out of several hundred pictures after an event/photoshoot.</p>

<p>When it comes to editing, you also have a lot more options to check your work: <strong>dual views to compare images</strong> (while selecting the bests), and <strong>before/after views</strong> to check while editing. You can also have several edited version of the same picture (I often have a b&amp;w version and a color).</p>

<p>The most useful feature to me in Lightroom that Picasa lacks (afaik), is <strong>settings synchronisation</strong>. I can work 5 minutes on one picture, and copy/paste (sync) the parameters of a picture to 150 others. So I can edit 150 pictures all at once, sync white balance across all the shots in the same lighting environment. And, when you start seeing a pattern in how you setup similar parameters for most shots you make, you can decide to create a <strong>reusable preset of parameters</strong>, which you can then apply to all pictures when you import them, and then tweak each selected pictures later for finer details (or special case where the parameter might not match this specific picture). <strong>If your workflow in Picasa seems slow, it's time to switch</strong> to Lightroom.</p>

<p>Lightroom records the <strong>history of all changes</strong> to each picture, so you can come back to them later, and revert them easily.</p>

<p>You can definitely setup Lightroom to <strong>""watch"" folders</strong> and add pictures to your catalog as you copy them to your Pictures folder. For deletion, I prefer to select and tag all the keepers, and filter out the rest in Lightroom, which has an option to completely delete them (both from the catalog and the hard disk). I shoot RAW+JPG so this comes handy as it deletes both files at the same time (and they only appear once in the Lightroom catalog).</p>

<p>A few years ago, when I started photography, I loved Picasa. And I still do. I recommend it to anyone starting out photography. When you reach the limitations of post-processing of Picasa (mainly in terms of fine control, recovery, parameter synching, and b&amp;w in my case), then give Lightroom a chance -Aperture has similar advantages I'm sure. </p>

<p>Lightroom will take more time to master, but it's definitely worth it when you're an amateur photographer who wants more control and has a huge collections of images (since I got my first DSLR, I've taken more than 100k shots, and I've got close to a TB of images, which I'm appreciating more and more as I learn to master the fine art of post-processing (analogous by all means to printing in a dark room, with an enlarger).</p>

<p>To summarize, <strong>if Picasa works for you right now, don't switch.</strong></p>

"How can color temperature be measured using a digital camera?","14497","","<p>I know that one can photograph a color-neutral card (white, gray, black) and use it for white balance, either in-camera or in post-processing.</p>

<p>Using an image of a color-neutral card taken under given lighting conditions, is there a way that the color temperature number can be measured by examining the color values in the image file?  Presumably one knows or assumes the tone of the card, e.g. all-white, 18% gray, or all black.</p>

<p>It'd be nice to develop a feel for color temperatures by measuring various sources.</p>
","<p>White balance tools (like those in Lightroom or Photoshop) will tell you the color temperature of the neutral card essentially directly, based on the color temperature data in the RAW file.</p>

<p>More theoretically, if you're shooting with a known color temperature (even approximately known), then the color of the neutral target is directly related to the color temperature of the lighting.  Doing this <strong>precisely</strong> has several big catches (e.g., it doesn't really apply to fluorescent or mixed lighting, and understanding color theory is a prerequisite), but doing it <strong>relatively</strong> is eminently practical:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the card is bluish, it's lit with a higher color temperature than your setting.</li>
<li>if the card is reddish, it's lit with a lower color temperature than your setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>With practice, the card isn't needed; you can see the relevant color casts in any neutral object, and particularly in shadows.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the best advice is to try to memorize the approximate color temperatures of typical situations, like this chart from <a href=""http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/white-balance.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cambridge in Colour</a> (the full article is worth a read):</p>

<ul>
<li>1000-2000K – Candlelight</li>
<li>2500-3500K – Tungsten Bulb (household variety)</li>
<li>3000-4000K – Sunrise/Sunset (clear sky)</li>
<li>4000-5000K – Fluorescent Lamps<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>5000-5500K – Electronic Flash</li>
<li>5000-6500K – Daylight with Clear Sky (sun overhead)<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>6500-8000K – Moderately Overcast Sky</li>
<li>9000-10000K – Shade or Heavily Overcast Sky</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>1</sup> Fluorescent lamps aren't standard light sources, and many variations exist, so this should be considered a <em>very</em> approximate figure.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> There's an old joke about the noon sky outside of Kodak's offices being exactly 5500K.</p>

"What workflow order makes sense with Lightroom 4 and Nik Software?","14457","","<p>I was thinking about how to optimize my workflow with these two tools and seek for advice. I would say one possible workflow would be the one below:</p>

<ul>
<li>adjust basic settings (exposure, black/white, etc..) in LR4.</li>
<li>set sharpening and noise reduction to zero</li>
<li>sharpener raw </li>
<li>dfine (or dfine first, and then sharpener?)</li>
<li>viveza and/or color efex</li>
<li>output sharpening, if needed  </li>
</ul>

<p>Does it make sense, or do you have any suggestions?</p>
","<p>I really like NIK plugins but because they are a bit cumbersome to use I only use them to process my ""keepers"" which isn't a lot of images. Usually around 5 - 10 after a successful shoot.  Both NIK Raw Pre-Sharpener and Dfine (noise reduction) are in my opinion superior Lightroom 4 noise reduction and sharpening BUT like other NIK plugins not as convenient as the built-in utilities. </p>

<p>My workflow is as follows: </p>

<p>(I always Export to a new NIK process with as a COPY with Lightroom adjustments so that I have a record of every step of the process the process.) </p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Lightroom 4 - Adjust levels, curves, white balance, exposure, colour tone and saturation, etc. + Apply lens correction, straighten and crop as needed (No sharpennig or noise control)</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Colour Effex Pro or Silver Effex Pro
Export to NIK as a cpy with Lightroom adjustments</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Viveza 2 - only if necessary.  Sometimes Colour Effex Pro will be sufficient, sometimes I use both sometimes either or. 
<strong>Step 4</strong> - If needed Dodge and Burn, vignette  (Photoshop or Lighroom 4) </p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - NIK Dfine - noise reduction</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - NIK Raw Pre-Sharpener  (Always LAST!)</p>

<p>I let my online printing service adjust output sharpening but when printing my own I use Lightroom 4 print sharpening.  </p>

<p><strong>HDR the workflow</strong> is the same except that processing bracketed exposures is a step # 1 and Color Effex Pro is often not necessary.   Also, I was an early user of NIK HDR Effex Pro but have since switched over to Photomatix which I find produces more ""natural"" looking results.  Of course it is easy to overcook any HDR image in any software. 
I still use HDR Effex Pro - I often process in both utilities then decide which result I like the best. Unfortunately I recently upgraded to HDR Effex Pro II and accidentally deleted all my 30 - 50 custom settings.  Still, even with all the upgrades in HDR Effex Pro II, Photomatix in my opinion handles various artifacts that are important to me as well as noise better. </p>

<p>Also, after HDR processing dust particles are ofter more visible in the image, especially in the sky or other bright areas of the image so I usually take care of those in LR - using the adjustment brush.   You can do that at any point after the HDR processing and before Dfine. I almost always do it just before Dfine in case any other processing enhances the dust particles further.  </p>

<p>If you need quick shots (moving clouds say) then I'd do away with mirror lockup if that's indeed the limiting factor.  If you can afford 1 second intervals, then go ahead and use mirror lockup.  I'd say do some tests and see if you can tell the difference though.</p>

<p>For welders' glass, they use values of ""shade"" from about 4 up to 11 or so. I know 11 is really dark.  Does anybody know if there is some sort of a formula to use to calculate how many f-stops a shade 10 filter would be, for example?</p>
","<p>I've been looking around for this information too!  I finally found the answer (after stumbling across your question first) at this <a href=""http://www.astronexus.com/node/3"">website</a>.</p>

<p>According to that page, the formula is:<br>
 OD = -log T<br>
 SN = 1 + (7/3) OD</p>

<p>where T = transmission rate, OD = optical density, and SN = shade number.<br>
For example, shade #10 gives SN = 10, OD = 27/7, and T = 0.000139, or nearly 13 stops! (calculating stops merely involves using base 2 instead of base 10 for the optical density. A quick and easy method is simply to divide the OD by log 2. Actually, that simplifies the formula you seek to: F = (1 / log 2) * (3/7) * (SN - 1)  ...combining the constant terms gives the approximate (and much simpler) equation of:</p>

<p><strong>F = 1.4 * (SN - 1)</strong></p>

<p>where F = number of equivalent f-stops!<br>
Thus, if you wanted, say, 10 f-stops, then F = 10, giving SN = 8.)</p>

<p>It was surprisingly difficult to find this information online!  It seems that most welding companies would rather tell you what shade number you need for specific applications rather than the actual formula they used to determine that shade number...</p>

<hr>

<p>To clarify the math, the reverse of the top equations is:</p>

<p>T = 10 ^ ( -(3/7)*(SN-1) )</p>

<p>and since 1 f-stop is half as much transmission:</p>

"What does it mean for a photograph to be ""high key""?","14266","","<p>As I learned the term, a high-key image is one where the shadows are effectively eliminated, and the mid-tone detail pushed into brighter zones. My question is simple: is this an accurate definition, or is it too simple (or just plain wrong)?</p>

<p>I've seen the term used to describe photos which just happen to have a lot of light, but also have significant areas of deep shadow, and a lot of detail in the mid-tones. I've also seen it to simply mean a photo where the exposure decision is slightly higher than typical. Are these uses ""within bounds""?</p>

<p>And, it may be obvious, but: is low-key the direct opposite of high-key, but dark instead of light, or is there something more subtle?</p>

Do they, and how? I always assumed that the term came by analogy with music*. Is it possible that the terms ""high-key lighting"" and ""high-key photograph"" are subtly different? (That is, does high-key lighting always result in high-key photographs, and can high-key photographs be made without a specific studio lighting set-up?)</p>

<hr>

<p>* <em>""those songs which are made for the high key be made for more life, the other in the low key with more grauetie and staidnesse""</em> — 16th-century Composer Thomas Morley</p>
","<h1>Short answer</h1>

<p>So, not being quite satisfied, I did some research. Here's the <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tldr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tl;dr</a> answer, but I hope you find the rest as interesting as I did.</p>

<p>In painting and in photography, the ""key"" of an image is the overall tendency of its tone scheme towards brightness or darkness.</p>

<p>When the key is bright, the image is high-key, and when it is dark, the image is low-key. Some more strict definitions require <em>all</em> tones of an image to match this bright or dark key, although generally it's a matter of the overall arrangement of the work.</p>

<p>This is <em>distinct</em> from high-key lighting, and the term predates cinema, and in fact predates artificial lighting. This is discussed further below, but it's important to realize that the effect of high-key lighting is not necessarily a high-key image, and that the effect of <em>low-key</em> lighting is something altogether different from a low-key image.</p>

<p>Many early sources use the term ""pitched"" in combination with key, suggesting that the analogy with music is at least not far off.</p>

<p>Generally, high-key refers to an overall scheme of ""high-pitched"" color, and implies some nuance in the high tones. However, an image which is bright overall because of blown-out overexposure would also qualify as high-key — just maybe not terribly attractive high-key. An image which is pitched in a high-key overall but which has strong elements of dark contrast may be considered high-key, but it may be more proper to consider it as using high-key technique in combination with a high-contrast graphic style.</p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p>This image demonstrates the delicate, ethereal quality possible with the technique. Color is present, but the predominant tones are light; even areas of darker contrast are in the mid-range. The subject is rendered in light-keyed tones, not outlined by dark shapes, and detail and form are softly retained.</p>

<h1>Usage in Artificial Lighting</h1>

<p>An element of confusion is brought by the usage of the cinematic terms ""high-key lighting"" and ""low-key lighting"". These terms come from the studio-era of feature film production in Hollywood, and like so many things from cinema, have application in still photography as well. They refer to the ratio of the main (""key"") light on the subject to the rest of the light in the scene. A high-key lighting setup generally diminishes or reduces shadows, making every part of the image visible; a low-key lighting setup features strong contrasts between pools of light and areas of darkness, often giving a three-dimensional <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chiaroscuro</a> effect to the subject.</p>

<p>One can see from this description that it's useful to make a distinction between these terms and those from traditional two-dimensional art. As is apparent when comparing the image above to a typical sitcom set, or a low-key photograph to Rembrandt, the visual effect is quite different.</p>

<p><strong><em>High-key image</em></strong>: ethereal, delicate, dream-like</p>

<p><strong><em>High-key lighting</em></strong>: cheery, upbeat, energetic</p>

<p><strong><em>Low-key image</em></strong>: somber, restrained, depressing</p>

<p><strong><em>Low-key lighting</em></strong>: dramatic, mysterious, taut</p>

<p>In fact, when considering emotional effect, it seems like high-key <em>lighting</em> and low-key <em>images</em> are almost polar opposites, while high-key images and low-key lighting (while very different in mood) both provide a more stylized and dramatic interpretation of a scene.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The background:</h1>

<h2>From some modern sources:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>HIGH KEY Describes an image composed of mainly light tones. Although exposure and lighting influence the effect, an inherently light-toned subject is almost essential. High-key photographs usually have pure or nearly pure white backgrounds. <em>[...]</em> The high-key effect requires tonal gradation or shadows for modeling, but precludes extremely dark shadows.

Zakia, <em>Focal Press</em>, 1993)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is basically the definition I had learned (and gave in the question above). But, I searched for some multiple references as well, just to be sure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many people think that high-key lighting means overexposure, but that's not the case. Overexposure is an entirely different tool. ""High key"" simply means that the vast majority of tones in the image are above middle gray, including any shadows. Excluding specular highlights, such as catchlights, there is usually detail in even the brightest areas. (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ddokilaXrcQC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=%22high%20key%22&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Master Lighting Guide for Portrait Photographers</a>, by Christopher Grey, <em>Amherst Media</em>, 2004)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grey also addresses low key, a few pages later, saying ""The obvious opposite of high-key, low-key lighting does not imply underexposure or rampant darkness. It simply requires that the majority of tones be below middle gray.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High-key photography makes use of a restricted tonal and color range. The image tends to display a delicate, ethereal, two-dimensional quality and is predominantly made up of light tones. This should not be confused with a high-contrast image, which can include both pure black and pure white tones in the shot. A high-key image has a squashed tonal range of predominantly medium to light grays and whites. (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=PZ_He_3n5xEC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22high%20key%22%20photography&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Digital Landscape Photography</a>, by Tim Gartside. <em>Cengage Learning</em>, 2003)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's more, and the continued section suggests — in some contrast to the previous quote — that the background should not only be bright but even overexposed. It also notes that ""it is often possible to"" combine elements of high-key with elements of high-contrast, giving a predominantly light photo with small areas of dark tones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High key means an image composed in the upper bracket, featuring whites and near-whites. It involves what in ordinary circumstances would be considered over-exposure. <em>[...]</em> As almost all hues weaken with increasing brightness, and certainly the primaries red, green, and blue, color plays very little part in most high-key images. Even so, there is scope for having an overall pastel tint, and also for judiciously introducing a single spot color that gains even more attention from being alone. (<a href=""http://www.focalpress.com/books/photography/michael_freeman39s_perfect_exposure.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perfect Exposure</a>, by Michael Freeman, <em>Focal Press</em>, 2009)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freeman has a whole section on high key, and it (along with the entire book, actually) is well worth reading. Although the quote above suggests overexposure, the accompanying images show that he intends that in a subtle, soft way, not harsh highlight clipping.</p>

<p>Freeman also notes that the term <em>should not</em> be confused with the cinematographic use of the term, where key and fill lights are balanced equally. Since Wikipedia implies (without references) that the term <em>did</em> come from television and cinema, I figured it was time to turn to the Pages of History — that is, Google Books and the Harvard University Library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically, paintings use a range of values from white to black with most of the values occurring in the middle of the gray scale. Key is the term used when a painting has a dominant range of tonal values at one end or the other of the gray scale. A painting is said to be <em>high key</em> if the dominant values in the painting are light. A painting is low key if the dominant values are dark <em>[...]</em>. This is not to say that all the values in a high key painting are only light or that all the values in a low key painting are only dark. To prevent a high key painting from looking weak, the use of a few carefully placed darks is necessary. This creates contrast and puts the values of the painting in context. Conversely, in a low key painting the strategic placement of a few brights puts the painting's generally darker values in context. (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Pkg3JrpXLxQC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22low%20key%22%20painting&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Incredible Light &amp; Texture in Watercolor</a>, by James Toogood, <em>North Light Books</em>, 2004)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is clearly not about photography, illustrating use of the term in the same way painting. I include this quote mostly for the interesting suggestions on how to use contrasting tones strategically. The example painting in the book is also a nice example of the somber, restrained low-key mood — very different from the edgy contrast of low-key lighting.</p>

  <p>1918    Photo-Miniature XV. Mar. (Gloss.),   *High-key, a style of photographic print (portrait or landscape) consisting entirely of light tones, differing little from each other in depth.
  1919    Brit. Jrnl. Photogr. Alm. 250   Photographs consisting almost entirely of light tones are said to be high-key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are journals I can dig up, but Google Books turned up much older references. First, an <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=76dAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=photograph%20%22high%20key%22&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">editorial from The Photographic News, Volume 52</a>, from 1907:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Low Key and High Key</p>
  
  <p>The expression ""low key"" may be taken to indicate that the most prominent features in the picture and the general scheme are in subdued tone; the lighting, for instance, may be delicate. Strong and powerful lighting effects but lack of strong shadows are generally inseparable from compositions in a ""high key."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This essay is a little boring, but the magazine as a whole is <em>awesome</em>. It's full of articles like ""Practical Points for Picture Makers"", ""Artificial Light Photography, and Some Notes on the New Jupiter Lamp"" , ""Simplified Factorial Development: A New System of Factors"", ""My Best Picture, and Why I Think So"" — in short, it's exactly like a modern photography blog. Except older.</p>

<p>More straightforwardly, from the same year, a <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CfdIAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=photograph%20%22high%20key%22&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glossary in The American Amateur Photographer and Camera and Dark Room</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Key. A picture is in a high key when all its tone values are of a light color, and vice versa. A tone is in the wrong key when it is either too light or too dark for the rest of the picture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But so much for the 20th century. Check out this 1899 <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ULoaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=high-key%20photograph&amp;pg=PA439#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article in <em>Wilson's photographic magazine</em></a>. Like the 1907 magazine, this bit is absolutely worth reading in its own right, because it's about how to make money as a professional photographer, and given a change of a century or so, wouldn't be much out of place on Photo-StackExchange:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another idea is to introduce a novelty in style, such as a portrait thrown into high relief by suitable lighting against a light ground and in a high key throughout; make only one print (no duplicates), and charge from $3 to gs for it. This specialty can be profitably worked on sitters who come for the ordinary dozen cabinets. Satisfy their desires first and then work the specialty. Take the ""special"" negative on your own responsibility; say nothing of it to the patron. Make your print and finish it as if ordered. Send it home with the order for cabinets, and a note or leaflet of explanation that only the single print is obtainable, negative destroyed, price so much, if approved; if not approved, print to be returned. The average, if the work is right, will be most profitable. The returned prints will supply the best class of specimens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, really, the entire essay is an entertaining read. But moving back to 1893, from the <em>The American Amateur Photographer</em>, from <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=W13QAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=photography%20%22high%20key%22&amp;pg=PA487#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an account in the ""Society News"" section of the showing of slides</a> at a club meeting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John C. Brown's Alaska slides were quite successful in suggesting the scintillating brilliancy of the great glaciers. Most of his slides were pitched in a very high key, and very properly; for we must recollect that besides the intensity of the sun's light we are surrounded by thousands of tons of transparent ice crystals polarizing the rays of white light by refraction, by reflection, and by interference; that we are fairly revelling in the most delicate colors of the spectrum, and that the eye is dazzled with the play of white, and blue, and rose, and pale orange yellow. It is a question whether even the longed for photography in colors would afford full satisfaction as a reminiscence of Glacier Bay; the beauty is in the kaleidoscopic changes and prismatic tints, not in their appearance at any given instant. Mr. Brown has given us the grotesque forms of the icebergs with the feeling of a sculptor, together with some idea of the effects of the northern atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really, mostly including that to note the historical comment about ""<em>the longed-for photography in colors</em>"". But it's also interesting to note the use of the musical word <em>pitched</em>.</p>

<p>So, continuing on, I came across <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Lsg-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Memoirs Illustrative of the Art of Glass-Painting</a>, published in 1865, which uses the terms high-key and low-key to distinguish between lighter and darker styles in church windows. Interesting.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to photography I can find is in the <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?ei=n-GQTfSjCM-10QHOv8StCw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=HMwwXpEv7tIC&amp;dq=photography+%22high+key%22&amp;q=%22high+key%22#search_anchor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Photographic Journal, Vol 83</a> of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain, from 1853. Unfortunately the full text isn't online, but the volume includes the term six times, and one excerpt gives high key as an example of ""shadowless photography"". And it seems to use the term easily, as if the reader would be familiar. I don't know the <a href=""http://www.rleggat.com/photohistory/history/lighting.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exact history of photographic lighting</a>; it'd be interesting to figure out what kind of lighting set-ups were common (or even possible) 158 years ago.</p>

<p>But that's not the end of it! As the article about glass suggests, the term appears in art outside of photography. Not surprisingly, since we've inherited a lot of things from painting, it's used there too, or at least was. This is from <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Q6axt1o1w4oC&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an article in the February 1865 issue of The Atlantic Monthly</a> about landscape painter Washington Allston (after whom the Boston neighborhood where I lived for several years was named):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whoever has made pictures and handled colors knows well that a subject pitched on a high key of light is vastly more difficult to manage than one of which the highest light is not above the middle tint. To keep on that high key which belongs to broad daylight, and yet preserve harmony, repose, and atmosphere, is in the highest degree difficult; but here it is successfully done [...].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the musical term is used in the description. That doesn't mean at all that the term <em>comes</em> from music, but it is definitely evocative.</p>

<p>But to my surprise, looking back <em>way</em> further, I found this, from 1783:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If to these different manners we add one more, that in which a silver-grey or pearly tint, is predominant, I believe every kind of harmony that can be produced by colours will be comprehended. One of the greatest examples in this mode is the famous marriage at Cana, in St. George's Church, at Venice, where the sky, which makes a very considerable part of the picture, is of the lightest blue colour, and the clouds perfectly white, the rest of the picture is in the same key, wrought from this high pitch. We see likewise many pictures of Guido in this tint; and indeed those that are so, are in his best manner. Female figures, angels and children, were the subjects in which Guido more particularly succeeded; and to such, the cleanness and neatness of this tint perfectly corresponds, and contributes not a little to that exquisite beauty and delicacy which so much distinguishes his works. To see this stile in perfection, we must again have recourse to the Dutch school, particularly to the works of the younger Vandevelde, and the younger Teniers, whose pictures are valued by the connoisseurs in proportion as they possess this excellence of a silver tint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from Sir Joshua Reynolds's <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=0RMFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Notes on The Art of Painting of Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy</a>, which made me blink, because this is the exact work (although not the same section) to which John Thomas Smith refers when he <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/521/what-is-the-rule-of-thirds/9239#9239"">apparently coins the phrase ""rule of thirds""</a>. (Reynolds does not appear to be inventing any terminology here, though.) Anyway, he doesn't say ""high key"" exactly, but ""key, wrought from this high pitch"" at least implies it strongly — and reinforces my original thought that there's an analogy with music.</p>

<h2>Reference for the Lighting Terms</h2>

<p>Clearly, there's a meaning that pre-dates cinematic lighting. It's possible that the term ""high-key lighting"" in the film industry grew hazily from the traditional visual arts, or it may simply be that ""key"" has so many meanings that it was bound to eventually attract more than one even in the same field — in this case, the key light as opposed to the key <em>tones</em>. Anyway:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The terms <em>low-key</em> and <em>high-key lighting</em> originated in the studio eras of feature film production in Hollywood. They seem counterintuitive — that is, the terms mean the opposite of what we think they should mean. Low-key lighting refers to the minimal use of fill light — that is, a relatively high key-to-fill ratio. This kind of lighting creates pools of light and rather harsh shadows. <em>[...]</em> Low-key lighting evokes a rather heavy and serious mood or feeling that enhances the emotional atmosphere of certain types of films. Low key lighting is similar to an effect in painting known as <em>chiaroscuro</em>. <em>[...]</em> High-key lighting presents a brightly lit scene with few shadow areas. <em>[...]</em> The light, happy atmosphere simulated by high-key lighting contrasts with the somber, mysterious, or threatening atmosphere of low-key lighting.

Musburger and Gorham Kindem, <em>Focal Press</em>, 2009)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I agree with <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10232/what-does-it-mean-for-a-photograph-to-be-high-key/10263#10263"">Matt Grum's assessment of Google searches</a> that in common use, the term today seems to often mean highly overexposed images where the remaining detail has been pulled back to be very dark, giving a highly graphic style with strong contrasting lines and shapes. I'm not going to argue too much with the evolution of language, but I think that in terms of  technical and historical vocabulary, that usage is wrong. However, that's not to say that common usage has completely changed the meaning of the term — most of the super-exposed, cranked-up images at least loosely fit, even though they might not really be using the style to best effect. (Fitting with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sturgeon's Law</a>, not necessarily a change in meaning.)</p>

<p>And I also agree with Michael Freeman that it's better to keep the term from the traditional two-dimensional arts distinct from the lighting vocabulary from cinematography. Both have their uses in photography.</p>

"Is there a standard tripod mount?","14261","","<p>Is there a standard tripod mount?  Is it reasonable to assume that a given tripod will attach successfully to a given camera, or will I have to research my options?</p>
","<p><strong>Yes.</strong> The tripod thread is standard: 1/4-20, which means ¼"", with 20 threads per inch. </p>

<p>This is specified by <a href=""http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO+1222%3a2010"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 1222:2010</a>. I'm not willing to pay the $57 for my own copy, but I'm kind of curious, as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod_%28photography%29#Screw_thread"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia says that the current standard</a> also allows 3/8-16 — apparently that's <a href=""http://photo.net/medium-format-photography-forum/00S0bQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an older mostly-European standard</a>. This is probably old-hat to aficionados of <a href=""http://www.largeformatphotography.info/forum/archive/index.php/t-68016.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">classic field cameras</a>, but was new to me — all of the modern Japanese DSLRs and compacts I've seen use the 1/4-20 thread. 3/8-16 <a href=""http://www.l-camera-forum.com/leica-forum/discus_e/messages/3/141761.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">may still be common</a> for larger-format cameras. I checked my grandfather's Voightländer Bessa medium format camera from the 1930s, and it uses 1/4-20. I think it's safe to say that for consumer and mass-market professional cameras, 1/4-20 is  universal.</p>

<p>The 3/8-16 standard <em>is</em> in wide use today in photography, though — just not for camera mounts. It's common for lighting gear, including lighting stands and mounts. I have some Manfrotto gear with the reversible studs — basically, camera mount one side, lighting equipment the other way. Also, as Michael Clark notes below, 3/8-16 is typical for connecting tripod heads to the legs. </p>

<p>The other important thing is that almost all modern tripods use a quick-release plate system. There's a small plate which has the tripod thread which screws directly to the camera, and then that snaps into the tripod head using a proprietary-to-each-company attachment. That means that even if your camera would use the less-common thread, you could get a plate that matches — for example, <a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/569262-REG/Gitzo_GS5370C_GS5370C_Quick_Release_Plate.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Gitzo plate which comes with both threads</a>. And adapters between these two threadings are readily available — probably mostly for ease in mixing and matching between camera and lighting support.</p>

"How do I enable auto-ISO in non-scene modes in a Nikon D5100?","14253","","<p>I'm trying to enable auto-ISO on my dad's Nikon D5100.

<blockquote>
  <p>This option is not available at current settings or in the camera's current state.</p>

<p>Surely auto-ISO is not only available in the preprogrammed modes. How do I enable it?</p>

<p>Update: there is a separate section to ""ISO sensitivity settings"" below the main choice. That is <em>only</em> available in the P, S, A, and M modes, and has ""Auto ISO sensitivity control"". I've set this to <em>ON</em>, but empirically it's the hard-set value above that actually gets used. What is this separate setting, why is it separate, and (most of all) why doesn't it work?</p>
","<p>Auto ISO isn't available in the non-scene modes <em>per se</em>.</p>

<p>The ISO Sensitivity Auto control option you mention in the latter part of your question is essentially 'Auto Pro'. You'll note in the menu that you can set a max ISO and a minimum shutter speed.</p>

<p>When ISO Sensitivity Auto control is enabled, the camera will endeavour to use the ISO you set, but will increase the ISO automatically (up to your defined max) if it's not achieving the shutter speed set in the menu. If you actually take a shot then check the settings used on the LCD, you may well see that the ISO will be a different value, and shown in red, to indicate that the camera took over and adjusted it automatically.</p>

"RAW Conversion is better on Canon Utilities or LightRoom?","14250","","<p>I have always used Picasa as I was with point and shot camera. Now, I want to learn photography and have brought a Canon DSLR with which I got Canon Utilities to manage the pictures and video. On internet and from friends, got to know about RAW files, conversion and some of the software for it. On internet, many people claimed that Abobe LightRoom should be used for for RAW conversion.</p>

<p>My question is, should I used Canon Utilities or LightRoom for RAW conversion? From both, which one gives best result for the conversion? My camera, Canon 600D/T3i offers 14 bit RAW. Also, can I use Picasa for the conversion?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>This is kind of a tough question, as there are various different aspects of Canon DPP and Lightroom/ACR that offer both pros and cons for each tool. Both DPP and LR/ACR will produce better results than Picasa, which while it does support RAW conversion, is not a top of the line tool explicitly designed for converting RAW files (it's more of a photo management tool than anything.)</p>

<p><strong>Canon Digital Photo Professional</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to Canon DPP, you'll probably find that it offers a lit better control over the shadows, and in some cases better noise reduction. DPP is straight from Canon, the designers of the CR2 raw format, and they maximize the dynamic range potential and electronic noise removal potential in their own tool. If you must extract the most dynamic range possible from your files, or tend to have problems with fixed pattern noise, DPP will generally do a slightly better job than ACR. DPP has also offered color curve editing for a while, a feature that has only recently made its way into Lightroom, albeit in a minimalistic way. In the past, the difference was significant enough that many Canon photographers would use DPP despite hating its UI, however with Lightroom 4.x and ACR 7.x, things are improving for Canon in those tools.</p>

<p>There are a few drawbacks to using Canon DPP. First and foremost, its not the greatest tool from a workflow or UI layout standpoint. It can at times be quite frustrating to work with. Another issue with DPP is its demosaicing algorithm. While it tends to handle dynamic range and noise well, it is not as good as LR/ACR at avoiding color moire in some cases, and for fine detail such as hair, dimples, pine needles, etc. it tends to produce semi-aliased edges. If you only have Photoshop+ACR 6 or Lightroom 3.x or older, then DPP does have quite a bit to offer...however it definitely comes with trade-offs. </p>

<p><strong>Photoshop w/ Adobe Camera RAW and Lightroom</strong></p>

<p>While Canon DPP has a few key things to offer, such as better DR when editing CR2 files, it lacks a lot compared to Photoshop+ACR or Lightroom. Both Photoshop and Lightroom have better UIs, and offer far more extensive tool sets with which to process your photos. Lightroom offers a very significant advantage in terms of workflow and library management. With the latest Lightroom 4.x releases, Lightroom brings several new features that are not present in DPP, such as print soft-proofing. Lightroom's newest raw processing engine, used in ACR 7.x and Lightroom 4.x, greatly enhances control over the full tonal range present in a RAW file. Particularly in the highlights, but also in the shadows. This closed the gap between LR/ACR and DPP, however it has not yet given Adobe's products an edge when it comes to extracting the most out of the available dynamic range. An area where LR/ACR excel is their demosaicing algorithm. It is a very refined algorithm that is capable of eliminating most color moire, and it is capable of producing very clean, sharp edges especially along fine detail like hair.</p>

<p>From a cons standpoint, LR/ACR are not as capable at removing noise, particularly electronic noise contributions, from CR2 files. Canon DPP still does a better job in this area. I've also had a hard time determining whether the latest LR/ACR does a better or worse job removing noise than Lightroom 3.x...in some cases it seems slightly better, in other cases LR4.x and ACR 7.x seem to blur a lot of useful detail away when removing noise that LR 3.x did not. When it comes to dynamic range, and extracting detail from the deep shadows, LR does not seem to do the CR2 format justice. Despite considerable improvements in Adobe's latest raw processing engine, Canon RAW files still seem to suffer quite a bit on the low end of the dynamic range. They fare quite well in the highlights, and LR 4.1 is able to extract an astonishing amount of detail from what one would normally think were completely blown white highlights. Shadow pulling, however, seem to greatly enhance noise, and if you have any fixed pattern noise (FPN), it readily comes to the surface when working shadows. FPN is usually only a problem at the lowest ISO settings...beyond ISO 400 noise is mostly photon shot noise and very random. At ISO 100 and 200 can often exhibit FPN right into the lower mid-tones (something that doesn't occur that often in DPP.)</p>

<p><strong>Choices</strong></p>

<p>Personally, I use Lightroom for my post-processing work. Despite its drawbacks in terms of handling Canon CR2 files and extracting the most out of dynamic range, and its sometimes lackluster noise removal, it has so much more to offer that I'm willing to accept those two drawbacks. Since Lightroom handles highlight dr so well for CR2 files, you can often mitigate the problems with shadow dr by exposing to the right (adjust exposure so it bunches up more in the highlights than the shadows, without oversaturating as much as possible). You can easily pull down highlights and have more dynamic range in the shadows to work with. You'll never realize the same amount of DR as you could extract from a camera using a Sony Exmor sensor (like the Nikon D800), but you can improve your options. If dynamic range or FPN removal is of paramount importance, you might want to look into using DPP, at least in those cases where you need to perform a lot of shadow lifting. You might take a hit to fine detail edge quality (and you might find that fine detail in general becomes a little more blocky), but you should see better results in the areas where LR is weakest.</p>

"What cheap colour calibrators are available for Linux?","14229","","<p>I have several computers (at work, at home, laptops, etc.) that all display my photos differently. Alas, it's time to get a colour calibration device — but which to choose?</p>

<p>I am no professional, so cheap/imprecise/old stuff is perfectly OK. I have been looking at various online stores like eBay and etc., but it looks quite like a jungle, and good reviews seem to be scarce.</p>

<p>And a tricky detail: I am using Linux everywhere, so it must be compatible.</p>
","<h2>ColorHug is the Best Answer</h2>

<p>Linux developer Richard Hughes has designed and sells an <a href=""http://www.hughski.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">open source colorimeter called the ColorHug</a>. If you are running Linux, and don't have other hardware available already, this is simple, cheap, and fast. (In fact, it's about 50× faster than the old GretagMacbeth I was using before.)</p>

<p>The current price is <a href=""http://www.hughski.com/buy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">£60 plus shipping</a> (each device is hand-assembled in the UK). You may actually be able to get one of the older Xrite/GretagMacbeth devices for a bit less, but unless you're really strapped for cash, the better experience of the ColorHug is probably worth it — and you'll have hardware and software designed to work together, rather than reverse-engineered.</p>

<p>But, you might find one of these devices very cheaply, or have one already. In that case:</p>

<h2>If You Have Another Device</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/screenshots.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gnome Color Manager</a> (now part of <a href=""http://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">colord</a>) can use <a href=""http://www.argyllcms.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Argyll CMS</a>, but it also supports the <a href=""http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/instruments.html#Huey"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pantone/X-Rite Huey</a> natively. According to the Gnome docs, the profiles produced natively aren't great, but it's easy. If you're using newer Gnome (3.x), it's been re-written and appears to have options to give better results with the same ease of use. I have a GretagMacbeth (now bought out by X-Rite) Eye-One Pro device, and it doesn't seem to work at all with even the new version, though — so maybe you still need the Huey.</p>

<p>Anyway, PeterT <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10757/why-not-use-a-camera-as-a-colorimeter"">pointed out</a> a program called <a href=""http://hoech.net/dispcalGUI/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dispcalGUI</a>, which is a cross-platform GUI front end for ArgyllCMS. It's still a little intimidating and not nearly as slick as Gnome Color Manager, but it's really easy to use once you spend a few minutes going through the <a href=""http://hoech.net/dispcalGUI/#quicksetup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quick setup</a> and <a href=""http://hoech.net/dispcalGUI/#usage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">usage documentation</a>. Works nicely with the device I have and produced good results with little fuss. See <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/14585/"">this question</a> for some after-you've-calibrated-and-profiled usage info on Linux.</p>

<p>Oh, and also from the dispcalGUI docs, a list of <a href=""http://hoech.net/dispcalGUI/#instruments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supported instruments</a>:</p>

<li>Datacolor/ColorVision Spyder 3</li>
</ul>

<p>And some notes on a few of these, based on research I've done:</p>

<p><strong>ColorMunki Design/Photo</strong> is expensive (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00169N0BK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$450</a>), and is a <em>spectrophotometer</em> rather than a <em>colorimeter</em> — it reads wider bands of colors at once, and can be used to measure surfaces like paper, not just monitors. I can't find the reference right now, but one review I found was very disappointed in the results. (I'll update this once I find it.) See below for the ColorMunki <em>Create</em>, though, which is a different product.</p>

<p><strong>X-Rite DTP-94</strong> — this is discontinued, but is one of the few to offer glass color filters rather than the dyed ones found in other instruments. Theoretically, this should last longer (the others may lose accuracy over time). And in general, this gets lauded as having the best results. The caveat, though, is huge — it's not as good for LCD screens as for CRT monitors, and wide-gamut displays are right out. Dunno if you can even find this anymore at <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00405EDPO"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-crazy prices</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pantone Huey</strong> — no particular note other than the one above (direct GCM support), and to mention that it can be had for <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000CR78C4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as little as $55 new</a> if you're lucky. (The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000OFC1YY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pro version</a> is the same hardware with different, irrelevant-to-us software, and that's not too expensive either at about $80 shipped.)</p>

<p><strong>X-Rite/GretagMacbeth i1/ Eye-One</strong> — I have the ""Pro"" model of this. It's an early revision, so it's pretty slow. I'm happy with the results visually even if it is a few years old; so if there is any filter color decay it's pretty subtle. All the i1 models listed (and the ColorMunki Create, and apparently also Lacie Blue Eye) work basically same way under Argyll CMS. The Pro model has a high-resolution mode which should give somewhat more accurate results. And my old model is quite slow — taking about 4 hours to do a high-quality calibration and profile! — but newer models are apparently faster.

X-rite Versions of this are <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000CR78CE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">roughly $135 new</a>; the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001E2J464"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ColorMunki Create looks like a deal at $75</a> (and it was briefly down to $65; maybe it will be again).</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The ColorHug isn't necessarily the absolute cheapest, but works very well and is actively supported. Unless you have easy, cheap access to another device, my recommendation is to just go with that.</p>

<p>For non-Linux solutions, the market situation is confusing, and it's hard to straighten out the hardware. However, it looks like basically all the competing companies who used to make things have collapsed into just X-Rite and Datacolor, and all of their current and recent colorimeter products (that is, the affordable ones!) work. The X-Rite Huey is generally cheaper, but the X-Rite Eye One products, in all the different names, can also be found below $100 as well, and may be a little better. Datacolor's Spyder products are to be avoided if you care about open source, but <em>do</em> also work (with the later versions being less of a hassle).</p>

"What print media works best for framed prints behind glass?","14225","","<p>I am planning to take a A3 printout of my family photo &amp; frame it. The frame is made of antique wood with clear glass on it. The glass has to be present so which type of photo print I need to take to make the colors in the photo really pop ? </p>

<p>Should I take a:</p>

<li>Matte Print</li>
<li>Glossy Print</li>
<li>Matte print with glossy lamination</li>
<li>Glossy print with matte lamination</li>
<li>Glossy print with glossy lamination</li>

<p>There are other print papers that the store guy was mentioning, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>I tried Matte print (option 1). It looked a bit dull &amp; unrefined. I also tried Glossy print (option 2) but it is not great either, and after sometime started to stick to the glass. </p>

<p>Which photo print is best for showcasing behind a glass frame?</p>
","<p>I run a print business and have tried a LOT of papers... </p>

<p>My favourite by a long way for framing is ""semi-gloss"" or ""Lustre"" - which has a slightly  textured glossy surface - a bit like old silver-halide ""Wedding paper"" as I'd call it.
The Lustre finish has a slightly more pronounced texture.</p>

<p>Dont bother with lamination for a framed picture - it can detract from the depth of colour, particularly the matte.</p>

<p>A word of warning - let the print dry for AT LEAST a day before framing it - otherwise, even though it may feel dry, it wont be, and the inside of your frame will fog up over the next few days, and stay.  </p>

<p>ETA: the media choice is also very much effected by the type of image that you are printing - for fine art B&amp;W I really like Hahnemuhle fine art papers - they are textured matte, and HAVE TO BE printed on with Matte specific inks, otherwise black comes out a flat grey. Your situation - I would still go with semi-gloss/ lustre. </p>

<p>Example: Hoya HD Protector or Hoya HD UV?</p>
","<p>First, I wouldn't be especially worried about the odd fingerprint, dust mark, or water on the lens as it would take quite a bit to make an impact. To give you a sense, helpfully posted in another thread is <a href=""https://www.lensrentals.com/news/2008.10.30/front-element-scratches"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this lens</a> which, despite massive damage to front element, still works and does so reasonably well.</p>

If you do get something on it, despite that, then cleaning tools such as the lens pen and microfibre cloths will help you remove it. That's if you even notice!</p>

<p>However, if you do get something like a UV filter, which will help with this problem, bear in mind that you still have to clean that with reasonable care or you introduce potential image artifacts beyond what the filter will already do. By the way, the downside really applies to both options in a way, primarily artifacts from light sources appearing in unexpected places.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6GKV.jpg"" alt=""Railway station with shafts of light""></p>

<p>I'm guessing this involves a tripod, a long exposure and strong sunlight, but presumably also some particulate in the air to catch the light? Is there a way to reliably replicate this effect in a building like a church?</p>
","<p>You've pretty much answered your own question there (except that you don't absolutely need a long exposure, it depends on the situation). The key ingredient is obviously the particulates in the air to reflect the light, but in the shot you've posted also the extreme exposure difference between the incoming sun and ambient light. The greater the difference, the fewer particulates you need in the air as each one will be shining brighter, and the better they will show up against a dark background. </p>

<p>Some post processing will probably help too. The photo you posted has always bothered me as it looks a little fake, I wouldn't be surprised if a little dodging went on in the darkroom to increase the brightness of the light shafts. </p>

<p>Here's an example of the effect caused by haze and precipitation in the atmosphere which I enhanced a little in Photoshop to emphasise the effect:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/castle3.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/castle3.jpg</a></p>

<p>To do this is a church you might need to ask them to turn the interior lights off to maximize the difference and then wait for the sun to shine directly through a window. Overexpose the shot to best reveal the shafts of light.</p>

<p>To reliably replicate it, assuming you're already cut the power, most churches are quite dusty so you could run around, beat the carpets and pew cusions a bit. That ought to put enough dust in the air to get the effect you're after! </p>

<p><em>disclaimer: don't acutally do that last part</em></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> You're still going to need a lot of dust or very strong contrast to get the effect you want in a church - here are a couple of shots from a recent wedding. Note how much brighter the light from the window is (I even had to darken it in the Raw conversion, the difference was greater than it looked) and yet it's not enough for any shafts of light to be visible:</p>

<p>What are AF-A,  AF-C, and AF-S ? </p>

<p>How do I use each mode, and when? I'm interested in which pictures or situations each is appropriate for, not camera specifics.</p>
","<p>AF-S is AF 'single'- your camera will focus on a fixed object when you press the AF button and will remain focused on that point for as long as you hold the button down. This is best for static subjects.</p>

<p>AF-C is AF 'continuous' - the camera will focus on whatever is in the relevant AF points (depending on how you have your AF coverage set up) and will attempt to keep the subject in focus wherever it moves, whether that's towards/away from the camera or laterally. This is best for continually-moving subjects, e.g. birds in flight.</p>

<p>AF-A is AF 'auto' and automatically switches between the two AF modes depending on what the subject is doing. This requires less effort on the part of the photographer, but you are relying on the camera guessing correctly what you are focussing on, and may result in unexpected focus.</p>

<p>For completion, on a Canon camera the equivalent modes are, respectively, One-Shot AF, AI Servo AF and AI Focus AF.</p>

"How do I use spot metering?","14042","","<p>What's the right way to use spot metering? Is it better to use in manual mode than one of the priority modes?</p>

<p>There's a question about <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/597/what-situations-are-best-suited-for-spot-metering"">when to use spot metering</a>, but none that serves as a tutorial to describe <em>how</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Please address the issue of exposure compensation. I am under the impression that spot metering is hard to use in aperture priority because you can't (to my knowledge) over/under expose an image in these modes since the camera will adjust other variables to get the proper exposure. (So I need to meter off something that is gray-ish since I can't meter off something black and compensate?)</p>

<p>This question is motivated by <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/7293/can-spot-metering-be-corrected-in-post-processing"">another one that I asked here</a>. It became clear that I didn't really know how to use spot metering.</p>
","<p>I wrote a tutorial about this very subject on my website. You can read it <a href=""http://nickminers.com/2009/05/the-zone-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>To summarise, there are two advantages to using it in manual mode:</p>

<ol>
<li>Once you've set your meter for the prevailing lighting conditions, you shouldn't need to worry about the exposure again (unless you need to change the aperture or shutter speed, or the lighting changes significantly)</li>
<li>Using manual mode allows you to move beyond the 2 stop range you get on most cameras with exposure compensation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Learn the zones (see link); then find something in your image that you want to assign to a particular zone. Spot metering is the best way to isolate a small part of your image without any extraneous elements getting in the way of the metering. I now shoot almost exclusively with manual spot metering.</p>

<p>Of course there may be valid reasons why it's not appropriate to use manual mode - you may be shooting in rapidly varying lighting conditions, for example. But learning how to use spot metering in conjunction with manual mode will add another tool to your belt.</p>

<p>Why are DSLR cameras are so much better in this area? What are the general recommendations to do this using a compact or super-zoom camera?</p>
","<p>There's a good answer from <a href=""http://blog.epicedits.com/2007/02/27/6-tips-for-controlling-depth-of-field/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brian Auer</a>, which I'll reproduce here, as it pretty much covers the problem you're trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ooh, good question. Yes, but how much will depend on the camera.</p>
  
  <p>If the camera has manual controls for aperture, that definitely helps. It also helps if the camera has zoom, as most P&amp;S cameras do. The problem with creating a shallow depth of field comes from the fact that the sensor is so small, and as a result the lens is close to the sensor — thus creating very small focal lengths. My P&amp;S has a focal length range from 6mm to 18mm — which is very small. They create an effective focal length much higher due to the small sensor size. As I said in the tips, a short focal length will produce an image with nearly everything in focus.</p>
  
  <p>So to blur the background using a P&amp;S, you’ll get your best results if you zoom in all the way, focus on something close (you don’t want to focus out to infinity), and have a background that is much further away. So your two points of control are focal length and subject distance. I just gave it a shot with my camera, and it does work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has a minimum focusing distance of 20cm /7.9in and a maximum reproduction ratio of 1:7.4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as in the title, what is 'maximum reproduction ratio'? What does it mean for practical purposes?</p>
","<p>The reproduction ratio means the largest that you can make a subject on the film/sensor compared to its real-life size. In the case of your lens, it means that the image on the film plane will be 1/7.4, or 5/37 of the actual size of the object when it is as close as you can possibly focus the lens.</p>

<p>If your camera has a full-frame (24x36mm), an object would have to be at least 177.6mm by 266.4mm to completely fill the frame using that lens at its closest focusing distance. A Nikon/Sony/Pentax APS-C (DX) sensor would be filled with an object 118.4mm x 177.6mm; a Canon APS-C would be filled with an object 111mm x 166.5mm. In this case, on a μ4/3 camera, that reproduction ratio will fill the frame with an object 99.9mm by 133.2mm.</p>

<p>A lens of this class is rarely used for extreme close-up or macro work due to the very small working distance between the lens and the subject, even if it could be made to focus more closely. (You can, however, achieve very high magnifications with short-focal-length lenses like this one by mounting them reversed on the camera using a special adapter, with or without extension tubes or bellows.) The lens can be considered a ""short normal"" or a ""moderate wide angle"", depending on who you ask, and is intended for general photography. In larger formats (35mm, medium and large format), a ""normal"" lens can often be pressed into macro service, but the ""normal"" focal length of the 4/3-sensor world means that the lens-to-subject distance gets very small, and keeping the camera from shadowing the subject becomes difficult.</p>

<p>Macro photography is a term used to describe reproduction ratios at or around 1:1. That is, the image on the camera's film/sensor approximates the actual size of the object. Lenses labeled ""macro"" usually have a reproduction ration of at least 1:4; many photographers wouldn't consider a lens to be a ""true macro"" unless it goes to at least life size (1:1). Microphotography refers to reproduction ratios significantly greater than 1:1 (the old definition used to start at 10:1; I don't know what the standard is today).</p>

"How do I properly white-balance my photographs when I'm shooting in mixed-lighting environments?","14021","","<p>I have a dSLR and I often find myself taking pictures of people in 'mixed lighting' environments (e.g. tungsten lighting and daylight, fluorescent and tungsten, or even the ‘nightmare lighting scenario’ of mixed fluorescent, tungsten and daylight). Since white balancing won't work (or at least it won't work <em>completely</em>) to remove the color cast from these sorts of mixed environments, what can I do to manage the multiple types of lighting in my environment?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Asked by <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4231/finer-recliner"">Finer Recliner</a>:</strong></p>

<p>I was at a wedding recently, and the reception hall had these huge windows that let a lot of sunlight through. The overhead lamps used inside the reception hall had a strong yellow tint to them. Given the two different types of light sources, ""white"" seems to have a vastly different definition in different parts of the photo. I found that a lot of my photos were near impossible to correct the white balance in post production (I shot in RAW). </p>

<p>Here is an example from the set I shot at the wedding:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6R4RC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If I set the white balance relative to something outdoors, everything inside looks too yellow (as seen). If I set the white balance relative to something indoors, everything that falls in the sunlight looks too blue. Neither looks particularly ""good"".</p>

<p>So, does anyone have tips for how to handle this sort of situation next time I take a shot? I'll also accept answers that offer post-processing advice.</p>

<p>// As an aside, I'm just an photography hobbyist...not a professional wedding photographer ;)</p>
","<p>It is important to understand that different types of lighting will produce different ‘color casts’ to the light in a photograph. While the eye is great at correcting for color ‘on-the-fly,’ our cameras aren’t very good at the task of adjusting in mixed environments at all. This can result in severely yellow/orange pictures, or sickly green ones, depending on the lighting present at the location. Generally the approaches to correcting for mixed-environment lighting depend on how much control you will have over the environment. The solution isn't to do <em>all</em> of these things, but to know about each of them such that you can do one (or more) depending on the situations you encounter.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Complete control</h3>

<p><em>(These solutions assume complete ability to control the ‘non-studio’ environment where the pictures will be taken. Because of the nature of completely controlling a location, to some extent it also assumes a large(ish) budget, and a good amount of time to engineer the environment.)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off the ‘contrasting’ light source(s)</strong> - The first thing to look for is whether you can turn off one (or more) of the competing light sources. In terms of ‘easy solutions’ this is always what I look at first because if I am able to remove ‘offending’ light sources with the flip of a switch, I can often bring the color cast back to ‘normal’ (or close to normal anyway). On occasion I have even found myself turning off lamps and gaffers taping or clamping  my own flashes inside of the lamp to provide the illumination of the subject from an ‘correct’ direction (such as when the lamp is in the frame so having it on would be expected). </li>
<li><strong>Overpower the ambient lighting</strong> - If you aren’t in a position to turn off the contrasting light sources, the ‘next best thing’ might be to simply overpower the offending light with your own light sources. This works best if you’re able to throw enough light to completely light the scene yourself (e.g. if you only have enough power to light the subject OR the background, but not the subject AND the background) this will be tough to pull-off. I’ve included this one because I know photographers who do the kinds of shoots where they have the time to engineer solutions like this. For those of us who work more ‘on-the-fly,’ or are hobbyists, it probably isn’t practical to completely engineer the lighting in this manner. </li>
<li><strong>Gel everything</strong> - This is the ‘Hollywood’ solution for using practical locations and if you look at many ‘behind the scenes’ extras on DVDs you can often see combinations of gels being used everywhere… CTO gels on all the tungsten, CTG on the fluorescent, ND or CTB gels on all the windows, etc. While it often isn’t practical to gel everything, doing so will essentially ensure a proper color balance. I’ve included this one in the interest of completeness, but for ‘most of us’ this will be an impractical option short of working on a large-scale paid shoot (where this sort of thing is done all the time)…</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Partial control</h3>

<p><em>(These solutions can often work in situations where complete control of the environment is not possible, but you do have some time to plan your photography at least a bit ahead of time or prepare the environment)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gel <em>something</em></strong> - If I’m in an environment that contains 3 different types of lighting I may not have the time, materials, or wherewithal to gel everything… But if given the choice I’ll often choose to gel <em>something</em>. Generally speaking the thing that I try to gel is the fluorescents if possible because a picture with an orange color cast is easier to manage and looks more ‘correct’ to the eye. A picture with a heavy green color cast on the other hand… That only looks good if you’re in the Matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Control the angles</strong> - This will be situation dependent, but sometimes it’s possible to eliminate ‘offending’ light sources simply by not shooting in the direction of the light source. For example, I recently shot a wedding reception in a gym with lots of ugly fluorescent lighting up above, as well as one wall of the gym being all windows. The solution ended up being to balance for the fluorescents and simply not shooting anything with my camera pointing towards the windows (though admittedly not shooting towards the big bay windows was also because it was a daytime wedding and the daylight would have blown out all my pictures).</li>
<li><strong>White balance for the main subject(s)</strong> - If ‘all else fails’ and you have no other options available, at least white balance for the subject. This will (more or less) get the color cast right for the skin tones, which are the most important element of most pictures. The rest of the colors in the photo may be off, but for some photos this will be forgivable, and in others you have a <em>few</em> options still available to you in post.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>No control</h3>

<p><em>(Though these can been solutions that are arrived at ahead of time, since they are post production solutions they can also be used ‘last ditch’ efforts, where either no color control was taken during the shoot, or the attempts at color control were not successful.)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Convert to B&amp;W</strong> - If you weren’t able to do anything to control the mixed lighting and/or the lighting came out in an unattractive way despite attempts to control it, one answer may be to simply make the picture black and white in order to remove <em>all</em> color cast.</li>
<li><strong>De-saturate in post</strong> - This is especially effective in situations where tungsten lighting has made pictures too orange. Often it can be an easy fix to simply ‘desaturate to taste’ and add a bit of blue (to tone down the pinks that invariably result from the desaturation).</li>
<li><strong>Mask the area(s) with improper color cast and rebalance them</strong> - Time consuming, but certainly an option if you have pictures that you need to keep, but the color cast is wrong. It is possible to come up with something relatively good looking by correcting the photograph for skin tones, and then using masks to further correct any areas where the remaining color is off.</li>

"What Yongnuo flash and trigger works with the Panasonic GH4","13824","","<p>I am so confused - I'm fairly new to the whole camera trigger thing, as well as new to Yongnuo and the GH4, but here's my thing:</p>

<p>All I want to do is figure out what I need if I want to control 2 or 3 Yongnuo flashes remotely (none on camera) in manual mode. Which Yongnuo flashes work and which triggers and how many do I need?</p>

<p>I've read up so much on this and it's so tough. People have opened up and rewired certain Canon-friendly Yongnuo triggers to make them work with the GH3, which I have NO intention of doing, and I'm just lost. I just want to go to Amazon, order the right flashes and triggers and sort it out at home, with the confidence that whatever I buy WILL work with the Panasonic GH4</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Get some YN-560III or YN-560IV flashes and a <a href=""http://flashhavoc.com/yongnuo-yn560-tx-now-available/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YN-560-TX</a>, if you're sure Yongnuo's what you want.</p>

<h3>You don't need to mod; just avoid the RF-603 (Mark I) triggers</h3>

<p>First off, posts that say you <em>have</em> to modify Yongnuo gear are probably old and only about the Yongnuo RF-603 (Mark I) radio triggers. They're transceivers. These triggers  auto-sense whether it's on a camera to switch into transmitter mode, but they do so via a signal on one of the TTL pins.  It works for Canon/Nikon, but for mirrorless mounts like Fuji X, micro four-thirds, or Sony NEX this signal is on a different pin or is placed where it doesn't hit the camera contact (i.e., with a Nikon unit, since Nikon's pins/contacts are placed differently than Canon/mft/Fuji).  Without receiving this specific signal, the unit never goes into transmit mode, and is always a receiver. Another bad side effect is that the test button even on Canon and Nikon doesn't work in hand--it has to be on the camera hotshoe to get the trigger to switch into transmitter mode.</p>

<h3>RF-603II and later triggers work on the MFT hotshoe</h3>

<p>Yongnuo addressed this issue with the RF-603MkII triggers (and the later RF-605 triggers) by putting an OFF/TX/TRx button on the side of the unit, so you can explicitly put the unit into transmitter mode when you want to (this also moved the on/off function to a place where you can reach it when a flash is mounted on it).  Upshot: it now works on mirrorless cameras and the test button works in hand.  So if all you want to do is fire a flash remotely, and you have some Panasonic or Olympus flashes to use with your GH4 off-camera, the YN-622, RF-603II, or RF-605 triggers all work just fine as manual-only triggers (i.e., all they can do is tell the flashes to fire in sync). The RF-602 triggers also work, since they have separate Rx/Tx units so the autoswitching deal never comes in to play.</p>

<p>Note: Panasonic and Olympus micro four-thirds mirrorless and four-thirds dSLR cameras all share the same hotshoe protocol. TTL, HSS, RC--they're compatible across the two brands.  As far as we know, Panasonic's making both the Panasonic and Olympus flashes, and each model on one side of the fence, has a near-identical sibling on the other side of the fence (e.g., the Olympus FL-600R and the Panasonic FL-360L are essentially the same unit with different badging). </p>

<p>See also: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/25013/is-there-a-radio-flash-control-system-for-olympus-that-allows-setting-flash-powe"">Is there a radio flash control system for Olympus that allows setting flash power from the camera?</a></p>

<h3>Yongnuo's YN-560 Gear</h3>

<p>But if you're planning to go all Yongnuo gear, then your best bet for mft, which will give you not just remote firing capability, but also manual power and zoom control from the camera, are the YN-560 Mk III and later flashes with a dedicated YN-560TX transmitter on the camera hotshoe. Be aware, there are limitations. These are <strong>manual only</strong> flashes. You do not get TTL. You do not get RC. You do not get FP (high-speed sync; i.e., you can't use shutter speeds faster than 1/250s without getting black bands at the top and/or bottom of the frame).  All you get are sync, and remote power/zoom control of the remote flash. The MkIV can also be used as an on-camera master if you want to have fill from an on-camera flash. The MkIII is slave-only. The nice part is that the radio receiver comes built-in to the flash, so you don't have to remember to bring along triggers and extra batteries.</p>

<p>At this time, Yongnuo (and most of the 3rd-party flash world) does not make mft-compatible TTL triggering gear. You are stuck with manual only.  The only TTL-capable remote radio triggers for flash that work with mft are the Aokatec AK-TTL.</p>

<p>While the YN Canon/Nikon YN-622 and RT triggering systems work from the mft hotshoe to remote control <em>Canon/Nikon</em> TTL gear, that's a <em>lot</em> of money to pay for function that won't be fully realized unless you've also got a Canon or Nikon camera, too.</p>

<h3>Reasons NOT to get Yongnuo</h3>

<p>Cheap flash gear is cheap for a reason. Component and build quality/consistency, copy consistency, QA testing, how convenient/reliable warranty repair is--these are all things that can add to the cost of a flash. Yongnuo has cut back on some of these to pass the savings on to you. In addition, they reverse engineer their gear, and they don't actually have a grand design for an overall system. Their manual 560/60x triggers aren't directly compatible with their TTL 622 triggers, or their reversed-engineered Canon RT system gear. Compare that to Phottix, RadioPopper, and PocketWizard systems, where there's a variety of TTL and manual triggers that work together. Consider where and how you may be planning on expanding your lighting system, as you would your camera system.</p>

"Why am I unable to capture as many stars as I can see with my eyes with my new DSLR?","13771","","<p>I have recently been given a Nikon D7000 as a gift. I have been trying to take pictures of stars on very clear nights. However, I am unable to make the camera capture many of the stars. My eyes seem to be able to see more stars than the camera, which with my past experience with worse cameras shouldn't be the case.</p>

<p>I am using a 30 sec exposure, f/3.8 aperture, 1600 ISO, exposure delay on, 2 second timer, no VR and no zoom. </p>

<p>Any ideas of what I could be doing wrong? Isn't the aperture large enough? </p>
","<p>Stars don't show up voluntarily on a photo. You need to tweak them a bit using photo editing tools on a computer. Best if you use RAW file format, and RAW-processing software to do this. JPEGs can be tweaked to show more stars, but with a lot less working room and result being of lesser quality.</p>

<p>The likely JPEG image you get with the exposure settings you used might look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qw0gO.jpg"" alt=""25 sec - f/4.0 - ISO 1600""></p>

<p>With relatively simple tweaking this <strong>same image</strong> can show up a lot more of stars:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPkOT.jpg"" alt=""25 sec - f/4.0 - ISO 1600""></p>

<p>My exposure settings were 25 sec - f/4.0 - ISO 1600, almost the same as yours. At post processing the RAW image I used +1 exposure correction, increased contrast and adjusted brightness curve to turn the first image into the second. It would have been a lot better to expose more to begin with, but this shot is my first ever attempt at photographing stars. I've learned a bit since then. Those images are from my answer to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/37997/capturing-the-milky-way-what-did-i-do-wrong"">""Capturing the Milky way, what did I do wrong?""</a> question.</p>

<p>Now, two things to pay attention to the next time you try it, <strong>up your ISO</strong> a bit, at least to 3200 or even 6400. And make sure your <strong>lens is in focus</strong> for the stars. Autofocus just don't make it, you have to do it manually with Focus Magnifying help in LiveView display.</p>

"What advantage does giclee have over traditional photosensitive print making?","13760","","<p>I'm trying to figure out why I would want to print giclee. </p>

<p>Let me set some background. I'm a gallery represented artist entering my third season. My sales are good. I print with Bay Photo (via SmugMug) and I'm quite happy with the service and print quality. I print mostly glossy or on metallic paper (using the Kodak Endura paper) and I've dabbled a bit with their ""print on metal"" service. (Gorgeous but expensive.)</p>

<p>So an photographer friend of mine is looking into giclee. Now I know what it is, I know the history of it (indeed, I'm a software engineer with a background in color science and there is a decent chance that the early Iris printers had some of my code in them, at least in the pre-press arena) but I'm surprised when I see the pricing of traditional photo sensitive paper printing vs giclee.</p>

<p>what advantage does giclee have over traditional photosensitive print making?
From smugmug.com, I see an 11x14 is $7.95 on glossy or metallic paper, but $44.20 for a giclee watercolor.</p>

<p>Now I understand perfectly that giclee can make it easy to go large, but a 30x40"" glossy is only $66 while a 30x40"" giclee is $178.50. So there's no advantage there.</p>

<p>One possible advantage is of course, paper, giclee lets you put your ink down on all sorts of surfaces.</p>

<p>So, aside from paper choice, <strong>what advantage does giclee have over traditional photosensitive print making?</strong></p>
","<p>Stan's answer about the archival qualities of a [giclee | inkjet] print (and I won't get into the semantics between the two words) is right on. Inkjet-printed images can be of far greater longevity, considering color-fastness and substrate color constant. This is all a long way of saying, if you are trying to sell something that will last a lifetime, Inkjet/Giclee is a better bet than a Type-R or Type-C print.</p>

<p>The other interesting advantage of using the inkjet technology is that you can apply it to far more surfaces that it would be practical to apply traditional photo-process to. People take it for granted now that they can get prints on canvas and prints on acetate and prints on art paper, etc. That wasn't the case 20 years ago. If you want to see some really fine examples of Giclee printing, track down some by <a href=""http://www.nasheditions.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nash Editions</a> (Graham Nash's company).

","<p>The Nikkor 18-55 has minimum focusing distance of 0.9 feet (0.28 m); if you really want to <strong>get closer</strong>, you'll need a macro lens. There are very few options in this price range.

Other options, such as a used Nikkor 60mm f/2.8 Micro or a new Sigma 50mm f/2.8 Macro, would leave you with manual focus (which is actually quite okay for close-up shots).</p>

<p>However, if you meant that you want to <strong>magnify your subjects more</strong> <em>without</em> actually getting closer to them, these focal lengths will obviously be too short (you already have those). If you had asked for image quality and low light performance, I would have suggested the Rokinon 85mm f/1.4, which is praised for those properties, but its rather heavy weight (1.4 lb / 635 g) and lack of AF will probably put you off.

<p>With what lens, I can take microscopic photos (with optical zoom 30X or higher) with my DSLR camera?</p>
","<p>There seems to be some understandable confusion here.</p>

<p>At ""ordinary shooting distances""¹ (for want of a better term), it is convenient to think of the focal length of a lens as a sort of shorthand for magnification. From 6 metres away (20 feet), a 600mm lens will make your subject appear roughly ten times larger than it woud have if you were using a 60mm lens. It's not <em>precisely</em> true except at infinity, but you'd need to go digging into the decimal places to notice the fib, and lensmakers usually round the actual focal length of the lens off to a ""familiar"" length for labelling, so let's call that <em>close enough for government work</em> (or <em>close enough for jazz</em>, if the government thing offends you).</p>

<p>In macro (and micro) photography, we are generally concerned with fixed amounts of magnification. If a 60mm macro lens and a 600mm macro lens are both labelled as having a ""1:1 reproduction ratio"", then they will both make the subject the same size on the sensor. That is, they will have the same magnification. The difference between the two lenses is that you could get that magnification using the 600mm lens from roughly ten times as far away from your subject as you could with the 60mm lens. In order to accomplish a 1:1 reproduction, though, both the subject and the sensor (or film) need to be the same distance from the optical centre of the lens, namely twice the focal length.² So you can think of focal length as a convenient shorhand for ""working distance"" in macro photography, but you do need to keep in mind that longer focal lengths mean larger, heavier and more expensive camera assemblies to get what is essentially the same magnification.</p>

<p>Micro photography is the reciprocal, if you will, of ""ordinary"" photography. That is, your subject will be closer than twice the focal length (but no closer than the focal length plus a smidgen) to the optical centre of the lens, and the sensor will be more than twice the focal length away from the optical centre it sees. And just as the slightest nudge of the focus ring will mean the difference between focusing 15m (50 feet) away and focusing 6m (20 feet) away, with the distance between the sensor and lens hardly changing at all  in ""ordinary"" photography, getting just <em>that much</em> closer to the subject means increasing the distance between the sensor and the lens by a huge amount (relative to the focal length) in micro photography. For this purely practical reason, <em>shorter</em> focal length lenses are used to produce higher magifications. The loss of working distance is more than adequately made up for by the reduction in size (and awkwardness) of the apparatus. It is one thing (and a difficult thing at that) to manage a 12.5mm micro lens on the end of a 30cm-long (12"") camera + bellows arrangement to get a particular magnification of a very small subject; it is quite another to manage a 600mm lens on the end of a 14.4-metre-long (48 feet, roughly) camera setup <em>for the same magnification</em>.</p>

<p>For actual photomicrosopy, the sort of microscope eyepiece adapters that have been mentioned in other answers are The One True Answer. They allow you to use very short focal length lenses that have been optimised for high magnifications, as well as a rigid apparatus that will present the fewest number of problems in capturing an image.</p>

<p>If all you want is macro (that is, images where something roughly an inch or 2.5cm in size will completely fill an APS-C- or DX-sized frame), then you want a macro lens. The focal length will determine how far from the subject you need to be to get that 1:1 magnification (though since most modern macro lenses are internal focus designs, you would actually have to check the minimum focus distance and the physical length of the lens to determine what the actual working distance would be). You can achieve somewhat greater magnifications by using extension tubes in conjunction with a macro lens.</p>

<p>For more extreme magnifications without actually resorting to a microscope, you might find that reversing a wide-angle lens will get you where you want to go. Wide angle lenses (these days) are almost all retrofocal, meaning that they have a longer focal length on the ""sensor"" side of the lens than they do on the ""object"" side. When you reverse the lens, that means that there is a greater distance between the subject and the lens than the marked focal length would indicate, and that you can project a much larger image onto the sensor by moving the lens only a little bit further from the sensor (using extension tubes or bellows). Even mounting the reversed lens directly onto the camera body will (usually) produce images greater than life-sized.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>¹ That is, distances at which no exposure compensation would have been needed to account for ""bellows draw"" on a unit-focus lens.</sup></p>

<p><sup>² I am simplifying reality here somewhat and using the thin lens version of the truth. With real photographic lenses, especially SLR lenses, it would be normal for the subject and the sensor to ""see"" the optical centre of the lens as being in two different places. The closest you'll see in the real modern world to true thin lens behaviour on SLRs will be with Tessar and Symmar lens designs. As well, internal focus lenses actually focus closer by ""zooming out"" to a shorter focal length while keeping the front of the lens anchored in space, so a ""60mm macro"" would actually be a 40-45mm lens when focused for 1:1.</sup></p>

"What is the difference between image size and image quality?","13657","","<p>I have a Casio EX-S12. It has a setting for image size, but also a separate setting for what it calls ""image quality"". There are three image quality values: ""Fine"", ""Normal"", and ""Economy"".</p>

<p>The Casio manual is not clear on what image ""quality"" actually means -- specifically how it's different from image size. All they say is that the ""Fine"" setting ""helps to bring out details when shooting a finely detailed image of nature that includes dense tree branches or leaves, or an image of a complex pattern.""

"Do you still need an ultra wide angle if you can now stitch images?","13655","","<p>Given that some software nowadays is so powerful you can easily stitch images together for a really wide view (either with panorama mode on camera or something like photoshop), is there still a point in bring ultra wide angle lenses on a trip? </p>
","<p>Great question. A little over a year ago, I bought an ultra-wide (10-24mm f/3.5) lens with an eye toward landscape shots and quickly saw that generally, I can stitch images taken on a longer lens and produce more satisfactory panoramas. So, as you ask, what's the point of an ultra-wide?</p>

<p>Well, to answer it, the best approach is probably to discuss what an ultra-wide does, so you can decide how to make it work for you. I'll include a couple examples - not the best examples of my best work, but that will make my point.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, an ultra-wide gets LOTS of stuff onto the same size sensor. This is why it fails for panoramas, and was never an excellent choice for them. It doesn't actually produce a bigger picture - it just makes stuff smaller.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, it tends to distort so that things on the edges look much bigger than they really are, proportionately to how the other things look. The wider the angle, the more this is true. Things in the middle tend to look normal, things on the edges, not so much.</p>

<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, it tends to exaggerate proportions. Whatever I want in the foreground, I have to get real up close to - like, within INCHES - everything else looks miles away. This is why it can fit big things in up close.</p>

<p>If you just want a panorama, then don't bother with the wide-angle. In my experience, the distortion means cropping and photoshopping and you end up with an image that captures just a bit more than a longer lens (say 24mm or 35mm), so what was the point?</p>

<p>But if you want to be able to get cool architectural features or interesting shots, then on vacation or anywhere, bring your ultra-wide.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>I squeezed in a frigate from about 5 meters:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/76OfI.jpg"" alt=""USS Constellation""></p>

<p>In this example, I am able to squeeze the whole church in (the tower is about 200 ft tall) by zooming way out to 10 mm and sitting inches from the family. Dad didn't think I could possibly get all of them in, let alone the church.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GhP8a.jpg"" alt=""family in front of a big church""></p>

<p>Because of the distortion, it isn't great for standard portraiture, but can be great for fun shots, like this one:</p>

"At what shutter speed threshold does a tripod start to matter?","13627","","<p>I use a Nikon D7000 with a prime 35mm/f1.8 lens. I usually shoot at the highest aperture with 200-1000 ISO, holding the camera steady and taking 6 or more shots in the hope of at least one coming out sharp.</p>

<p>It seems like more often than not, they don't come out as sharp as I wish.</p>

<p>Recently I've been thinking about when the tripod becomes significant. Is there some sort of starting shutter speed threshold to abide by?</p>
","<p>Of course the answer is, <em>it depends</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A common <em>rule</em> often mentioned is that to get sharp images hand held, you need a shutter speed that is 1/focal length used.</strong> When using this rule though you must also take your format or sensor size into account. Lucky for you, you do have a full frame(35mm) sensor so no factor is necessary. You must also consider if your lens or body has image stabilization/vibration reduction built in.</p>

<p>In your specific example, with a D700 and a Nikon 35mm f/1.8AF(non-VR), you should then be able to shoot hand held until about 1/35th of a second, or more likely 1/30s or so. Does this mean that every shot at 1/30th of a second will be tack sharp? No it does not. It is just a general rule of thumb that may or may not work for you and your shooting style.</p>

<p>If the image is critical and you have a tripod available, certainly use it with any and all shutter speeds. The technique that you have noted of shooting in burst mode and determining which is the sharpest is a fair idea and used often by today's digital shooters. But <strong>the fact is, if you care about sharpness and printing big, you will use a tripod for every shot if it is possible.</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example I created with a full frame camera and a 40mm lens, shot at 1/40s over 4 shots, hand held from 3ft. Not a definitive test by any means but at least shows in practice what following the ""rule"" may get you:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K8N6G.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Much more detailed information with examples of this rule in practice can be found at the following link: <a href=""http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/technical/handholding_shutter_speed.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/technical/handholding_shutter_speed.html</a></p>

<p>To concisely answer your question, <strong>a tripod <em>always</em> matters, but practically speaking for shots slower then 1/focal length I highly recommend a tripod.</strong></p>

"Does using a lens adapter change focal length?","13605","","<p>Does using a lens adapter change the field of view?</p>

<p>I recently bought a Sony NEX-5, an extra Minolta MD 50mm 1.7/f lens and a MD to E-mount adapter and I was wondering, as the adapter increases the distance between the sensor and the lens by ~10mm, does this effectively make my 50mm lens a ~60mm lens? Or am I just misunderstanding things?</p>
","<p>The adapter bridges the gap in flange distance (distance between mount and sensor/film) between the NEX native E-mount (18mm), and the MD/SR mount (43.5mm). Therefore, the focal length of the MD lens isn't affected, it's still at its native flange distance from the sensor. </p>

<p>If you were to adapt an MD lens to a mount with longer flange distance (i.e. canon EF, 44mm), the net effect would be that of an extension tube, equivalent FoV but the focus range would shift, allowing a closer minimum focus (and therefore, increased maximum magnification) but losing the ability to focus on infinity.</p>

<p>However, your FoV IS affected by the APS-C-size sensor in the NEX-5, causing an effective 1.6x crop in FoV (about the same as an 80mm lens in your case).</p>

<li>Manual focus towards infinity</li>

<p>The main question: <strong>Why can't night photographs be as sharp as daily photographs</strong> (with approperiate exposure times of course)?</p>
","<p>Firstly I notice your aperture is set at 1.8. This will make DOF very narrow, making focusing very difficult. Also your camera is very good at higher iso, so try using 1600 / 3200 initially. Try setting the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use auto focus to focus on something with a defined edge (the tops of the trees?), then switch to manual to keep the focus.</li>
<li>Use a higher iso, such as 1600+</li>
<li>Use a narrower aperture to increase dof, try f8 to start</li>
<li>Try aperture priority to get a close to correct exposure. try this initially. note these settings and switch to manual exposure and adjust the settings from those noted as you see fit.</li>
<li>Use <a href=""http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""DoF Calculator"">Dof Calculator</a> to get the hyperfocal distance. You will note that focussing at infinty means everything within approx 100ft is out of focus. At f8, the hyperfocal distance is approx 25 ft, so try focussing on something at approx that distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know how you get on.</p>

<p>PS. I also note that from the metadata that you have a brightness value of -4 dialled in, is this intentional?</p>

"Differences between DSLR and DSLT?","13563","","<p>I already have a Sony SLT camera but I still want to understand the differences between a DSLR and DSLT. It's hard for me to compare because I don't have or ever owned a DSLR so the behaviour is very foreign to me. </p>

<p>From what I understand in theory, this is what I'm guessing:</p>

<p><strong>SLT</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Live exposure preview (changes according to ISO, aperture, shutter speed, WB)</li>
<li>Full time PDAF both in viewfinder and in liveview (lcd)</li>
<li>DoF preview button can be used in viewfinder and in liveview</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DSLR</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>No live exposure preview with viewfinder but preview in liveview</li>
<li>Full time PDAF in liveview but not in viewfinder</li>
<li>DoF preview button can be used in viewfinder and in liveview</li>
</ul>

<p>If I understood everything correctly, here are my followup questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How does a DSLR do continuous focusing (AI servo/AFC)? Does it literally flip the mirror up, take the shot, put the mirror down, refocus, and repeat?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a DSLR user account for the fact that the OVF has significantly greater dynamic range than the actual user? Do you just get used to it and compensate mentally?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: the difference is in an SLR the mirror flips up to take a photo, whereas the SLT employs a semi-transparent mirror so that the mirror never has to move.</p>

<p>Now to your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) How does a DSLR do continuous focusing (AI servo/AFC)? Does it literally flip the mirror up, take the shot, put the mirror down, refocuses and repeat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's correct, assuming the DSLR is not in live-view mode.</p>

<p>If the camera has a live-view mode and that is turned on, then the mirror will stay up the whole time (and you won't see anything through the optical viewfinder at any time) and it'll switch to CDAF which is usually slower in a DSLR.</p>

<p>Wheras in the SLT camera it should be able to continuously use PDAF auto-focus while taking a shot or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) How does a DSLR user account for the fact that the OVF has significantly greater dynamic range than the actual user? Do you just get used to it and compensate mentally?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you get used to it, just as you get used to judging the contrast of a scene with <em>just your eyes</em> - no camera at all.</p>

<p>Besides, even with cameras that have a live-view or digital viewfinder, you can't rely on the depth of blacks or contrast shown there to be indicative of the recorded picture - often sunlight, reflections and the relative quality of the LCD display make that hard.  You still have to do some level of mental correction.  There's also histograms and things that you can turn on.</p>

<p>So, my questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any experiences regarding the Canon EOS 7D and heavy rain,
snow or splash water? </li>
<li>Can I be sure that my equipment will survive a photo shoot in the rain or in a very dusty location?</li>
</ul>
","<p><strong>Unfortunately, very few camera models specify the amount of resistance as anything measurable.</strong></p>

<p>Water and dust resistance, as specified by Canon, means very little. If it said waterproof and dustproof that would be a stronger statement. I also feel lawyers got involved somewhere in the writing of these things. For example, some Nikon manuals say 'resistant to dust and casual humidity'. Again, it has very little meaning.</p>

<p>The 7D falls among those cameras with vaguely specified resistance. Unfortunately, you have to try to find out. The 7D I used was subjected to snow without any problems. Actually, falling snow rarely is a problem even for non-weather-sealed camera as long as you wipe it off before you go into an environment where it would melt. I have no experience with a 7D under rain.</p>

<p>To be sure about your equipment's resistance you have to try it and even there, bring a backup. I used a Pentax K-7 in a shoot during a sand-storm and it worked perfectly. When I got to the hotel, I rinsed it under the tap for a minute or so to clean it. The polarizer I had though took a beating and I could hear sand in it between the rings for weeks after. It probably saved my lens though :) On the other hand, it took less than 15s for a Canon Rebel (not sure which model, probably XSi) to stop working completely in the storm. Canon asked for $150 or so to clean the sand out.</p>

","<p>There is an advantage to Compact-Flash cards which you get with the fastest models and sufficiently fast camera. This is not what accounts for most of the price difference, volume is. SD cards are sold on considerably higher volume than CF ones. When CF cards were more popular, it used to be the opposite.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I would not worry at all about this. The most advantageous card is the one that fits in your camera!

"Will Canon's EF and EF-S lenses work better for Canon's mirrorless cameras than mirrorless cameras from other brands?","13464","","<p>Currently I have a Canon 60D, but after carrying it with me on a trip I have started to think about a lighter camera. I want the camera to be easier to carry around for long sightseeing/tourism trips, but still be customizable with lenses. Therefore I have started to look at mirrorless cameras. </p>

<p>As I have a Canon camera it would be nice to be able to use my old lenses on the new mirrorless camera. Canon has an official adapter for using EF and EF-S on their mirrorless cameras, but I have read that the focusing is slower when using this adapter than the native (EF-M) lenses.</p>

<p>Also when looking for mirrorless cameras on the internet there seem to be other brands which offers good cameras, where you can use third party adapters for connecting Canon lenses to them. But also for these adapters, I heard there can be some focusing problems.</p>

<p>My questions is: will my lenses work worse on mirrorless cameras from other brands than on Canon's own mirrorless cameras? Slower focus and/or other problems? Does anybody have experience with this which they can share?</p>
","<p>I don't think there's going to be a huge amount to choose from when it comes to adapting Canon dSLR lenses to mirrorless cameras.  If you want autofocus and aperture control from the body, then you have to get a communicating adapter, and that's liable to be expensive, and the autofocus mechanisms being different between dSLRs and mirrorless, there's always going to be something of a performance hit across those two platforms.  While using Canon lenses and a Canon adapter on an EOS M camera might get you an AF performance increase, I wouldn't expect there to be a day-and-night improvement between that, and say, a Metabones EOS to Sony E-mount adapter, given that the EOS M cameras aren't exactly lightning-fast tracking-AF performers to begin with.</p>

<p>Looking at the bigger picture of which mirrorless system is a good purchase candidate I think you're losing sight of the reason you want to move to mirrorless. Most of us go there to get a small, lightweight setup. And just swapping the bodies and not the lenses, too, doesn't really gain you a whole lot <a href=""http://camerasize.com/compact/#351.377.2,100.377,351.349,ha,t"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in terms of bulk</a>.  I think the path you're envisioning is good if you want a small lightweight second body, or you only plan on using the occasional EF/EF-S exotic lens. But if you avoid getting EF-M lenses, you're going to merely be swapping the 60D for an EOS M, but still carting all the same lenses around. And an adapter.</p>

<p>And if you do get EF-M lenses to go with an EOS M, the problem is going to be that there are really only two of them to choose from (18-55 and the 22), unless you live in Asia or Europe, at which point you have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EF-M_lens_mount"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">four</a> to choose from. And that's still the smallest native lens lineup of all the mirrorless systems. Sony E-mount, Fuji X, and micro four-thirds have mindshare among the mirrorless enthusiasts for a reason--they're full systems. EOS M isn't one, yet, particularly for a North American customer.</p>

<p>Then again, I'm probably biased because I shoot both Canon dSLRS and micro four-thirds mirrorless. :D</p>

"Can I merge multiple photos to reduce noise?","13456","","<p>This is not about HDR, exposure fusion, or any kind of bracketing (exposure, focus, ISO, what have you).</p>

<p>There's an excellent iOS app called <a href=""http://www.cortexcamera.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cortex Camera</a> that takes a couple of dozen photos in a burst and then merges them to produce a low-noise photo -- one that has so little noise that you would normally consider it beyond the iDevice's capability.

<li><p>I'm okay with both free stuff ($0) and cheap software (like $20, not like $100).</p></li>
<li><p>I am not looking for an onerous, multi-step process with multiple decisions to make and different things to try, but more like a 20-second one: drag the source images in, press Fuse, and press Save.</p></li>
<li><p>I require the software to work without a tripod or a remote shutter release, since if I have to carry these with me, I might as well use a long exposure and be done with it.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that the software should handle the camera moving a bit between shots (both horizontally and vertically) and rotating a tiny bit. It can't assume perfectly aligned shots -- that's not useful for me.</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>The technique used by Cortex Camera is called <em>Median Blending</em>. Astrophotographers have been using this concept for years to combine multiple photos of dim objects in the night sky to reduce the noise and increase contrast and color. It is often referred to as <em>image stacking</em> in which hundreds of images of the same piece of sky are overlaid and the values for each pixel are set at the median value for that pixel from all of the combined images. But astrophotography is far from the only type of imaging that benefits from <em>Median Blending</em>.</p>

<p>Most full featured imaging applications, such as Photoshop and the GIMP, include the ability to do image stacking. There are also some cameras such as the Sony A-mount and E-mount cameras that can do this in-camera. <strong>Depending on exactly which model NEX you have, your camera may already include this feature. It is called <em>Twilight Handheld Mode</em>.</strong> The camera captures a series of photos in rapid succession (maybe 5 photos) and then merges them to create a low-noise JPEG. As with anything done in-camera, you give up the finer control of a post-processing application for the convenience and time savings of letting the camera make many decisions for you.</p>

<p>Although it works fairly well without a tripod, for the ultimate in resolution you will still want to stabilize the camera. When the camera moves slightly from one frame to the next, then everything in the image will shift a certain number of pixels. If the shift is purely <em>horizontal</em> and/or <em>vertical</em>, there isn't much loss in terms of absolute resolution. This is rarely the case. When the shift from one photo to the next is diagonal, or worse yet <em>rotational</em>, then there is not a one-to-one correspondence of pixels from one frame to the next. The use of a Bayer filter to mask different pixels with different colors also comes into play when the camera shifts between exposure. This reduces the effectiveness of using the median value of each pixel by a miniscule amount in much the same way that using a <em>lens correction profile</em> to correct the distortion created by a lens' design will reduce the absolute resolution of an image.</p>

"Lightroom plugin development -- is it worth it?","13434","","<p>I recently upgraded my photo organization and management workflow from ""nothing at all"" to Lightroom 4, and while I'm generally very pleased with the software, one feature that it's sorely lacking is the ability to record any sort of macros or scripts to automate repetitive tasks -- during the course of my migration into lightroom, there have been a lot of repetitive tasks that I've wanted to do, and I'm wondering if it's worth learning how to write LR plugins to do some of these tasks.  To give you examples of the kinds of things that I want to automate:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a large group of stacked RAW+PSD+JPG photos, select the file in each stack with the JPG extension and make it the top of the stack</li>
<li>Perform a mass copy of metadata from an (existing) RAW file to an (existing) JPEG file</li>
</ul>

<p>I can see a lot of other ways that scripts could make image management within Lightroom even easier than it is now.  My question then has three parts:</p>

<p>1) How difficult is it to write Lightroom plugins?  I'm well-versed in a number of programming languages (C/C++, Python, Perl), but I've not done anything with Lua.  Is the Lightroom API easy to hook into, and does it require any specialized tools for development?</p>

<p>2) Can I write scripts to perform the kind of tasks I describe above easily?</p>

<p>3) Are there any good resources or tutorials that I can read to get started with Lightroom plugin development?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I've not done anything with Lua</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.lua.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lua</a> is probably the simplest, cleanest programming language I know. (And <a href=""http://tangentsoft.net/resume/"" rel=""noreferrer"">I know a few</a>.)</p>

<p>Lua's simplicity is also its biggest weakness: being a small, clean language by design, it doesn't have a lot of stuff built into it that you'd expect to find when coming from an industrial-grade language like Java, or a batteries-included language like Python.</p>

<p>Lua is designed to be extended by C, which in this case means Lightroom's SDK. That's great if Adobe's done the work to provide the tools you need that aren't built into Lua, but every now and then you'll probably find yourself calling out to external tools to get things done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the Lightroom API easy to hook into</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only tricky part about it is that you need to structure your source code in a particular way and provide a special <code>Info.lua</code> file to tell Lightroom about your plugin. It's all explained <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshoplightroom.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">in the SDK docs</a>. The SDK includes several functioning plugins to start from, including a fairly elaborate ""hello world"" plugin which can be scavenged for useful starting code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>does it require any specialized tools for development?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can get by with just a text editor.</p>

<p>There is no debugging facility built into Lightroom, but there is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_debugging#printf_debugging"" rel=""noreferrer"">debug logging</a> facility in the SDK. You can catch these messages in either <code>WinDbg</code> on Windows or <code>Console</code> on OS X.</p>

<p>A more recent development is the open source <a href=""http://studio.zerobrane.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ZeroBrane Studio</a> Lua IDE. You can use this instead of another text editor, but the really cool bit is that it is possible to <a href=""http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/debugging-lightroom-plugins-zerobrane-studio-ide"" rel=""noreferrer"">attach it to your running plugin</a> which lets you debug it as it runs. I've tried this, and it does help reduce the fix/reload/restart debugging cycle time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I write scripts to perform the kind of tasks I describe above easily?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think either task is 100% do-able using only the Lightroom SDK, but it can do a lot of the work for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>select the file in each stack with the JPG extension and make it the top of the stack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's some vaguely Lua-like code to get you <em>almost</em> all the way there:</p>

<pre><code>for photo in catalog:getMultipleSelectedOrAllPhotos() do

<p>Unfortunately, I don't see a way in the SDK to do that innermost comment line's action, as of LR 5 at least. The best I can come up with is to call <code>catalog:setSelectedPhotos(peer)</code>, then leave it to the user to actually click the number badge to reorder the stack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perform a mass copy of metadata from an (existing) RAW file to an (existing) JPEG file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do some of this with the existing SDK, but there are limitations.</p>

<p>For example, while you can <em>read</em> the value of the EXIF <code>dateTimeOriginal</code> field, there is no facility in the SDK itself to <em>set</em> the value. I assume this is because the Lightroom developers decided this shouldn't ever be changed programmatically, that it is precious information from the camera. (Why that should be the case when there is a Metadata > Edit Capture Time... menu item I don't know, but there you have it.)</p>

<p>But, whenever the SDK tries to trap you with one of these limitations, there is often an escape hatch. You can install <a href=""http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ExifTool</a> and call out to it from Lua, for example. That's not a perfect solution, because you then have an inconsistency between the catalog metadata and the photo metadata, but Lightroom will notice and put a badge on the photo, which when clicked will let you resolve the conflict by reloading the metadata from the photo.</p>

<p>(You'll want to have the ""Automatically write changes into XMP"" option set in the Catalog Settings dialog when using such a plugin. Otherwise, you make it easier to create a two-way conflict, where both the catalog <em>and</em> photo metadata have changed. Lightroom doesn't know how to merge the two sets of metadata; it makes you pick one, and it overwrites the other metadata copy with it.)</p>

"Why do cameras put photos in multiple folders on a memory card?","13332","","<p>Recently when looking at my memory card I noticed that there were multiple folders on the memory card. The file path looked like this: </p>

<pre><code>DCIM/100D5100
DCIM/101D5100 
</code></pre>

<p>The D5100 is the camera I am using but I have seen this behavior on multiple cameras. Why does the camera(s) automatically split the photos into multiple folders? </p>

<p>Note: The photos will go from 1 - 345  for folder 1 then 345 - 700 for folder 2 etc. but I have not seen any patterns that would dictate when a new folder is created. </p>
","<p>This is really a case of <em>read your camera manual</em>. If your camera did not come with a full one, there will be one on a CD. The behavior greatly varies.</p>

<p>Usually cameras use filenames which gives them 4-digit numbering (some use 5 numbers), so you could in theory have 9999 photos in a single folder. However, cameras can break down these images in folders differently. Furthermore, some cameras let you control this using their Setup/Config menus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some DSLRs like the Pentax K-5 aim to keep folders with a set number of images (500 in this case) but they can give you more since they won't break up a bracket.</li>
<li>Some cameras wont break up bursts, some put them in separate folders.</li>
<li>Some also have separate folders for images taken in panorama assist mode.</li>
<li>A few models also break up folders by calendar days and name the folder according to the month and day.</li>
<li>They can also break things by number of photos shot instead of counting the ones kept. In this case you will have always less than a certain number. Nikon entry-level cameras usually follows this approach with a limit of 499 or 999.</li>
<li>Finally, some DSLRs, SLDs and a handful of ultra-zoom let folders be created by the user. In this case the folder still contains 3 digit sequence number which increments should the folder itself goes beyond the capacity which the camera likes.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Personally I find this annoying to have to copy from more than one folder but I'm not the one designing these things! What I do is to rename all files sequentially using a small Python script after copying the keepers to my computer.</em></p>

<li>Tripod Mount Ring B 78mm </li>
<li>Tripod Mount Ring C 82mm</li>
<li>Tripod Mount Ring D 68-72mm</li>

<p>Most Canon rings have a hinge that allows the collar to be removed without dismounting the lens. Only Canon ""B"" rings do not have a hinge and do require the lens to be dismounted to remove the ring. 3rd party rings come in both hinged and hinge-less designs. Some users prefer the hinge-less version for ease of use when using the lens collar to transition from landscape to portrait orientation. Other users prefer the ability provided by the hinge to add/remove the collar without dismounting the lens.</p>

The only lens that uses the Tripod Mount Ring B (B) not supplied with the collar as standard equipment is the EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro (non-L) which does not have lugs that fit in the slots and groove. There is a plastic adapter included with the B(B) ring that fits the EF100mm 2.8 USM Macro lens for use with the B(B) ring. </p>

What are some good options for me to carry and store my camera and a tripod if I'm also carrying around a big hiking backpack with me?</p>

<p>Specific to my situation, I'd like to consider cheaper options as I don't plan on backpacking enough to make a considerable investment.</p>

","<p><strong>Having the camera accessible is critically important to get a variety of shots</strong> along the way. Huge backpacks are not ideal for this. I used a <a href=""http://products.lowepro.com/product/Toploader-Zoom-55-AW,2205,8.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Top-Loading zoom</a> bag when I carried fewer lenses ;) This <strong>bag is quite cheap and will serve you in the future</strong> too, it comes in different sizes and colors.</p>

<p><strong>The tripod should easily be able to be attached to your backpack.</strong> Below is good for a small one or on the side. Most backpacks have plenty of straps or at least loops where you can attach straps to hold additional items. If you use a <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/article/gorillapod-howto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gorillapod SLR-Zoom</a>, then it is even better to hook it somewhere you can reach.

"What is difference between a 18-55mm and 18-105mm lens?","13267","","<p>So what I meant to say is that what exactly is the difference between 18-55mm lens (in general, not specific to any company) and a 18-105mm lens. To me 18-105mm lens looks much better (not considering price), but then why people would also buy 18-55mm lens? and then probably another lens for 55-105mm (if it exists, or similar case for other mm). </p>

<p>The point is that if 18-105 can do all the work of two lens, then why do people buy two different lenses? </p>

<p>And I have seen combos like</p>

<ul>
<li>18-55mm + 55-105mm</li>
<li>18-105mm</li>
</ul>

<p>So which one should i go with?</p>
","<p>The 18-55mm is generally a much smaller lens, also with smaller front element diameter. The 18-105mm, if you want to have the same maximum apertures, is a heavier, bulkier lens.</p>

<p>If the price is the same, and you want the same max. apertures, the 18-55mm is a <em>lighter</em> lens, the 18-105mm is a <em>more versatile</em> lens.</p>

<p>Image quality: you would expect the 18-55mm to have better image quality, but usually it is not the case, and e.g. a Nikon 18-105mm is a much better lens compared to a 18-55mm. (Much better is: comparing optical quality by photographing reference images and checking sharpness, aberration, vignetting.)</p>

<p>I used both on Canon and Nikon, I love my 18-105mm although it is not as handy as a 18-55mm.</p>

<p>There is no such lens as 55-105mm as I know. That is a short range that is much better covered with prime lenses, e.g. a 50 mm and a 85mm or 105mm. You would not use a zoom in that short range, and definitely would not keep replacing your 18-55mm with a theoretical 55-105mm.</p>

"How do I properly expose dark scenes containing bright light sources?","13254","","<p>I'm new in photography, however I have some basic knowledge of exposure, aperture, etc.</p>

<p>I own a Nikon D7000. The issue I've found in number of pics I've taken (in P mode) is that whenever the scene is relatively dark and there is a bright contrasting lighting source (bulb or sky), then I get too dark of a picture overall.

<p>What I can do to make light source be darker and the rest of dark scene be brighter?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cVRES.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>You're asking the right question, ""How do <strong>I</strong> properly expose...?""  Put the emphasis on the ""I"" part of that.  If you are using ""P"" mode then you are not determining the exposure. Your camera is.  And your camera thinks it is taking a snapshot of your Aunt Mathilda at Christmas, and has no idea that you are trying to do something creative.  So in cases like this you need to take control, meaning switching to ""M"" manual mode, or at the very least, playing with camera features like ""exposure compensation"" or ""exposure lock"" or ""spot metering"".  Look these up in your camera's manual.</p>

<p>Generally, you want to look at a scene like this and decide what parts of it you want to be be the well-exposed.  Presumably in this photo you wanted the worker to be be a little brighter, so you could see more detail.  These could be done a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a photo like you did, then examine the results and maybe the histogram and take another shot with positive exposure compensation.</li>
<li>Zoom in so you are excluding the brighter lights</li>
<li>Meter the shot when centered below the person, with the lights excluded and then either use exposure lock (if your camera has it) or set that exposure manually after reframing the shot the way you want it.</li>
<li>Enable spot metering so your exposure is determined by the very center of the frame, giving less weight to the lights on the side.</li>
<li>Bracket your exposure, so you automatically get shots 1 stop faster and slower.  This also allows you to do some post processing, even HDR.</li>

"Can a drop of a camera+lens cause AF calibration issues on either -- or both -- the lens and the body? What are the mechanics involved here?","13238","","<p>My question is, if you drop a camera, and you think you might have an AF issue, what are the mechanics involved that might cause a mis-calibration?  I can imagine that the lens has movable parts -- but what about the body?  In the body's case, it's mostly electronic and one would expect an 'all-or-nothing' breakage?  Am I wrong?</p>

<p>My new 6D dropped onto carpet with a 35mm 1.4L attached to it, from a height of 18 in (45 cm).  It's hard to tell whether focusing is spot-on because the camera is new, so I have no basis of comparison.  I'm trying to set up more pixel-peeping-type focus tests to see if it's front or back focused.  Right now I'm suspecting the lens might have been affected slightly.  It doesn't seem as sharp...</p>

<p>This is less a 'what do I do here' question than a 'how does autofocus work, exactly, inside' type of question.  I'm curious how a bump can affect AF in the body itself.</p>
","<p>Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Assuming there <em>is</em> damage (an 18"" drop onto carpet isn't likely to have damaged anything, but it's possible) the most likely situation might be a warping of the lens mount so that the mount isn't parallel with the sensor (either the focus sensor or the main imaging sensor). The focus sensor would focus on one point, but another point at the same distance elsewhere on the sensor might be out of focus. <a href=""http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs178/applets/autofocusPD.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> and <a href=""http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs178/applets/autofocusCD.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> are nice writeups with interactive graphics illustrating the two most common types of SLR autofocus systems.</p>

One slight snag I found in RAWTherapee was expanded windows would often not respond to me trying to minimize again, although this may have been a snag in my view settings rather than a general software bug.

<p>It's a bit of a hangover to the film days when there wasn't a rear LCD. You could say it's easier to pull back and look at the rear LCD screen than to pull back <em>and</em> rotate the camera to look at the top. In fact I believe some film cameras such as the Minolta Maxxum 7 had exposure information LCD screens on the back instead of the top.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I buy the point about the LCD screen being too bright when your eyes are adjusted to starlight. You can turn the brightness right down, and/or stick an ND gel over the rear screen when doing astrophotography if necessary.</p>

"Why do we use RGB instead of wavelengths to represent colours?","13145","","<p>As we know, the colour of a particular beam of light depends on its <em>frequency</em> (or <em>wavelength</em>). Also, isn't that the information which is first captured by digital cameras? Then, why do we use formats like <em>RGB</em> (or <em>CMYK</em>, <em>HSV</em> etc.) to represent colours digitally?</p>
","<p>I think there are some misconceptions in prior answers, so here's what I think is true.  Reference:  Noboru Ohta and Alan R. Robertson, Colorimetry:  Fundamentals and Applications (2005).</p>

<p>A light source need not have a single frequency.  Reflected light, which is most of what we see in the world, need not have a single frequency.  Instead it has an energy spectrum, i.e., its energy content as a function of frequency.  The spectrum can be measured by instruments called spectrophotometers.</p>

<p>As was discovered in the nineteenth century, humans see many different spectra as having the same color.  Experiments are done in which light of two different spectra is generated by means of lamps and filters and people are asked, are these the same color?  With such experiments, one verifies that people don't see the spectrum, but only its integrals with certain weighting functions.</p>

<p>Digital cameras capture the response to light of sets of photodiodes covered with different filters, and not the fuller spectrum that you'd see with a spectrophotometer.  Three or four different types of filters are used.  The result is stored in a raw file output by the camera, although many people suspect that raw files are ""cooked"" to a greater or lesser extent by camera manufacturers (camera sensors are of course highly proprietary).  The physiological responses can be approximated by applying a matrix transformation to the raw data.</p>

<p>For convenience, rather than using approximations to physiological responses, other types of triples of numbers are employed to name colors, e.g., Lab, described in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space</a> (but note warning on page).  One must distinguish triples which can express the full range of estimated physiological responses from others, like RGB, which can't.  The latter are used because they do express the colors which computer screens can display.  They are the result of conversions from triples like Lab, or from raw data.  CMYK is for printers.</p>

Let's say you're taking a picture of your friend in front of a landmark with several people walking by. The app allows you to remove the people from the photo, leaving only the background and your friend. The app isn't just doing a clone of the surrounding image to paint over unwanted subjects. It's actually taking multiple images, detecting which objects are moving, and letting you select them for removal. This sounds awesome! But I don't want to be limited to taking pictures with a smart phone.</p>

<p>I would like to take multiple photos of the same scene. (<em>Maybe</em> with a tripod, but it would be better if I didn't have to use a tripod.) Then I would somehow blend them together to remove unwanted elements. How do I do that? I know there are tons of photoshop tutorials out there, but all the ones I find just tell you how to use the clone tool.</p>
","<p>To do this in Photoshop (Available in Photoshop <em>Extended</em> and later CC versions only):</p>

<ul>
<li>File > Scripts > Load Files into Stack</li>
<li>Select all layers and use Edit > Auto Align to align them (if necessary)</li>
<li>Layer > Smart Objects > Convert to Smart Object</li>
<li>Layer > Smart Objects > Stack Mode and choose Median</li>
</ul>

<p>This will compare pixels between all your images that you've stacked, and use the median value, which means if a person was in a spot in one or two frames, but that spot was empty in 6-8 frames, Photoshop will use the most common value (which is were there was no person there).</p>

<p>This would remove most ""ghosts"" from the image.  You could then manually mask out anything left with Mark J P's method.  If there is still someone there (because they were sitting in one spot in all your frames, THEN you will have to resort to the clone tool.</p>

<p>It looks like this feature has been around since CS3.  PhotoshopNews has a description and tutorial with example images <a href=""http://photoshopnews.com/2007/03/27/image-stacks-in-photoshop-cs3-extended/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a></p>

"How wide can a lens be before it begins to produce distortion?","13132","","<p>Some lenses will produce distortion near a photo's edges (lines that should be straight begin to curve). Fisheye lenses definitely do this, and some ultra-wide lenses will do this too. I like wide lenses, but I'm not a fan of the distortion a fisheye lens produces. </p>

<p>What is the widest lens I can get before distortion is apparent? Lens length (mm) or capturable degrees would be the preferred answer format... but I won't be surprised if the answer is more complicated than that.</p>
","<p>It is <em>much</em> more complicated than that. There are 85mm prime lenses I'm aware of that exhibit some degree of barrel distortion, and barrel distortion is almost a given at the wide end of a zoom lens no matter how long that wide end is. On the other hand, at the ""long"" end of the Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8, you would have to be shooting brick walls to notice any barrel distortion, and even then it's only at the very edges of the frame (on a crop-sensor camera, of course). And the very same lens may exhibit different geometric distortions at the same focal length but at different focus distances. Modern lenses are a complex interplay between a lot of different lens elements that often change their spatial relationships as the lens is adjusted (focused or zoomed).</p>

<p>There are several prime lenses under 20mm that come close to being properly rectilinear. Sigma's 14mm lens was great in that regard, but a lousy lens otherwise, unfortunately (it was terminally soft anywhere but at the center of the image, had poor contrast, flare everywhere, etc.). Nikon and Canon both offer 14mm lenses that have slight and easily correctable barrel distortion (<em>slight</em> being relative in the extreme wide-angle world).</p>

<p>The good news is that geometric distortions are fairly easy to correct in post. (And recent Nikons will do it in-camera; I don't know about other brands.)</p>

<p>The bad news is that even if gross geometric distortions are corrected, that does nothing about the foreshortening distortion that makes spheres appear like ellipsoids and gives people at the edge of the frame funny-shaped heads.</p>

<p>That's not got anything to do with the rectilinearity (the absence of barrel and pincushion distortion) of the lens, but with perspective. In order for things to look right, your point of view (when looking at the picture) needs to be about the same as the camera's point of view was when the picture was taken. (Give it a try -- if you have a picture that has perspective distortion, just get your face really, really close to the print.)</p>

"What methods do macro photographers use to get so close to butterflies, bees, insects and the like?","13074","","<p>I have seen some super macro photos of things like butterflies and bees that left me wondering how the photographer is able to get so close to the subject long enough to take a photo.</p>

<p>Most of the time when I try sneaking up on a fly to swat it I get a few feet away when it flies away. </p>

<p>Does macro photography mean having to set up your equipment pointed at a flower or otherwise enticing lure and waiting for the subject to fly in and pose? </p>
","<p>There are a couple things you need to get great super-close macro shots of insects. </p>

<p><strong>The first</strong>, and <em>supremely most important</em>, is patience. You are going to fail to get the shot FAR more than you will succeed when trying to get 1:1 or better insect macros. Over time, two things will happen: As you hang around a location, insects will become adjusted to you, and will be less likely to fly away. Over the long term, if you observe carefully, you'll begin to learn the patterns of insect behavior, which will lean in your favor.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, you will need to be out photographing at the right time. Insects are cold blooded, so morning is a particularly good time to find sluggish, sleeping insects. They need sunlight to warm up, so before those morning rays of sunshine start warming your subjects up is an ideal time. When you don't have the option of an early-morning bug-hunt, an alternative method of ""slowing"" critters down is <em>bait</em>! Bees and many other insects love a sweet treat, and a drop of sugar water can give you the necessary time to frame and capture a bug out of bed. </p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, you will need the right lens for the job. Most camera brands offer true 1:1 ""Macro"" lenses. These lenses will magnify your scene at 1.0x size on the sensor (i.e. a bee 30mm in size photographed at MFD with a 1:1 macro will be projected 30mm in size onto your sensor.) More magnification will help you capture finer, smaller detail such that, when blown up in post processing, will exhibit more detail than you can see with the naked eye. If you own a Canon DSLR, you also have the option of using the MP-E 65mm 1-5x Macro Zoom lens, which can give you up to 5.0x magnification (5:1). Extension tubes can also help increase magnification, especially with a true 1:1 macro lens, also giving you larger than life magnification.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, a good macro ring flash will be extremely handy when trying to capture insects in less than ideal lighting. When out and about in nature, lighting can change often, especially if your subject is on the move. A macro ring flash is a hotshoe flash that mounts on the end of your lens (to the lens hood mount), and offers more pleasing illumination than a standard flash. It also gets that extra illumination exactly where you need it....right on your subject. There are a variety of accessories you can either buy or make for a ring flash as well, such as softening filters, or partial blockers to prevent flash from one side and keep it on another.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, a nice macro focusing rail mount or tripod head will be a huge assist to achieving the right plane of focus. Sometimes you have no option but to go hand-held, and chase your subjects around. If you are lucky enough to be out and about at ""golden hour"", sunrise before your buggy subjects have all warmed up started buzzing around, you will have more time to compose your shots and capture ideal moments. A macro focusing rail will help you maintain MFD (minimum focusing distance), without the hassle of manually moving your tripod or monopod around when recomposing. A good macro focusing rail will give you 4 degrees of smooth sliding freedom to frame and compose, without the composition-busting need to pick up the camera and move it yourself.</p>

<p>Another thing to be aware of when photographing insect macros is your DOF. At macro scale, depth of field can become vanishingly thin. Unlike portrait photography where you are always chasing that balance of widest aperture and ideal sharpness, in macro photography, you are always chasing the most DOF you can acquire without under-exposing. The sheer volume of fine detail available in a single insect eye is astounding, so noise and diffraction are your greatest enemies. Try to keep your ISO as low as possible, but don't be afraid at all to increase it beyond 100. You will often find yourself at ISO 400 or beyond, and a camera with good high ISO performance will make it a lot easier to get the DOF you need and still be able to expose correctly. For moving subjects, you may find that you use ISO as high as 1600. A ring flash is also a great way to help keep your ISO low and still be able to use motion-stopping shutter speeds.</p>

<p>Here are some macro shots from some of the great insect macro photographers on DeviantArt.com:</p>

"How to photograph a room showing both room & view out a window?","13073","","<p>I sometimes find I want to photograph a room showing the view outside the window. This is tricky — either  you adjust the shutter speed so that the the window is so bright  you can see no detail, or the room looks very dark and gloomy.  </p>

<p>Are there any techniques I can use to get the best photo showing as much as possible of both room and view? </p>

<p>My camera is a Sony Nex3, and for this sort of thing I usually use it with an elderly Pentax-M 1:2.8 / 28mm manual focus lens with an adaptor, although I would be prepared to buy another (cheap manual!) lens. </p>
","<p>Any camera is going to struggle with the dynamic range of that sort of situation.  Very hard to get the room and the outside both exposed reasonably at the same time.  With enough flash power you can do it by flooding the room with light I suppose.</p>

<p>But the easier way is to use a tripod and take two exposures, one for the inside and one for out, and blend them together in your editing tool.  I think it's best if you leave the outside exposure pretty bright, otherwise it looks fake.</p>

<p>You can use HDR, but if you have a few windows that are easy to mask, I'd just blend two exposures manually.</p>

<p>Simple example:</p>

"Using bulb mode with EOS Remote app without having to hold down shutter button possible?","13052","","<p>Does the EOS Remote app somehow support timed shutter speeds (for their DSLRs) longer than 30 seconds or a press-and-lock feature when in <code>BULB</code> mode? I've not found such a feature and I guess it could be absent so the (free) app won't compete with Canon's own expensive shutter releases.</p>

<p>As of now I need to keep pressing the button, and it would ruin the image if I have to press a lit display during the entire exposure. It's both very cumbersome and the light from the display affects the final image.</p>
","<p>No, the EOS Remote app does not have a press-and-lock feature for bulb-mode shooting, like, say, the Triggertrap app does.  However, the Triggertrap app is unlikely to work for you, either, given that you need two smartphones to use the wi-fi feature for triggering, as well as a camera shutter cable and dongle.</p>

<p>Your best bet is, as has been mentioned, to try a different form of shutter release--either remotes or a cable release that do have a lock. Magic Lantern's Bulb Timer feature or a CHDK script may work for you to do this without additional hardware, but this depends on whether or not there's a suitable build for your specific camera.</p>

<p>Canon and Nikon cameras can be connected to AC power by means of an adapter that fits in the battery slot. For example, Canon DSLRs that take an LB-E6 battery (like the 5D II, 6D, and 7D) can use an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007FMG6D6"" rel=""noreferrer"">ACK-E6 adapter</a>:</p>

"What is the difference between luminance and illuminance?","13022","","<p>The more I read about this, the more confused I become. <strong><em>Illuminance</em></strong>, as I understand it,  measured in <em>lux</em>, is the perceived brightness of light on a surface. It's what you'd measure with an incident light sensor. <strong><em>Luminance</em></strong>, then, is how much reflected light you'd perceive looking at that surface. This is what the light meter in a camera measures. Am I correct so far?</p>

<p>In both cases, the word ""perceived"" is important, because the scales are weighted using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">luminosity function</a> to map wavelengths to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/7963"">the human eye's particular sensitivities</a>. However, in the case of illuminance, there's only <em>actual</em> perception if your <em>eye</em> happens to be the surface in question.</p>

<p>I can basically grasp this, but then I come across charts saying things like ""family living room: 50 lux"". Wait, hold on! Does that really mean that the typical lights in a house are that bright, or is it just confused and wrong, or am <em>I</em> confused and wrong?</p>

<p>If you're not taking pictures of light sources directly, why would an incident light meter reading ever be useful in photography? Reflected light recorded on film or by a sensor is usually what makes a photograph. So, if I have an incident light meter, <em>how</em> does that reading relate meaningfully to my camera settings?</p>

<p>Since incident light meters <em>are</em> sold and used, this implies that there must be <em>some</em> useful conversion. <em>But this is where my brain explodes.</em> Google tells me that 1 lumen equals 1 candela, so therefore 1 lumen/m² (i.e. 1 lux) must equal 1 candela/m2 (i.e. 1 nit). But clearly something is missing from this. There's something called a ""steradian"". Cones are involved. I'd never heard of this before; how does it fit in? I can see how it might be determined when calculating the usefulness of LED home lighting, but for a photo, I'm at a loss.</p>

<p>Some part of my (exploded, from the last paragraph) brain is trying to relate this to the difference between flash metering with TTL and with an incident meter. But how can the incident meter work without knowing the reflectance properties of the objects in the scene? Is this what the ""C"" in the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10093/how-to-calculate-lux-from-ev/10094#10094"">incident light meter lux→EV standard</a> is all about? Is it just an average-this-probably-will-work value, or is there more to it than that? And if it is just an average, what knowledge is necessary for compensating for off-averages scenes? (As with the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1048/what-is-the-18-gray-tone-and-how-do-i-make-a-18-gray-card-in-photoshop"">K constant and 18% gray with reflective metering</a>, where the photographer simply judges if the scene should be rendered brighter or darker than the average given by the meter.)</p>

<p>So yeah, so much confusion. In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the difference?</li>
<li>Can one meaningfully convert between the two?</li>
<li>When and how are illuminance / incident light measurements useful for photography?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Update: I appreciate Stan's answer, which covers the third point of when and how pretty well. And I think I've <em>basically</em> got the first point figured out, as described above. But I'd appreciate some answers covering the issue of conversion as well, both in the mathematical abstract and as the practical for photography. And I wouldn't mind more why and how, either.</p>
","<p>Stan's answer is excellent in explaining metering from a practical standpoint. You also seem to be asking what the specifics are, particularly around <em>steradians</em> and conversion from Lux to EV. Using the Wikipedia articles you have linked, and a few child links from there, I believe I can explain a few things, and leave the rest up to extrapolation.</p>

<p>First off, <strong>steradians</strong>. Strange term, and odd concept, however once you understand what it really is, things start to make more sense. To take a step back, lets talk about <em>radians</em> first. A radian is an angular measure, which simply put means the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One <em>radian</em> is an arc that is equal
  in length to the radius of a circle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A radian is measured in the two-dimensional plane. A steradian is similar to a radian, only measured in three dimensions. The definition of a steradian is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One <em>steradian</em> is a circular patch on
  a sphere's surface who's area is equal
  to the square of the radius of the
  sphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A steradian is an odd ""projection"" of a 2D subtended angle into three dimensional space, or what is called a <em>solid angle</em>. The intersection of the 2D angle with the sphere's surface intersects a circular patch (which is itself bisected by the radian arc.) Another term for it is <em>squared radian</em>. The solid angle that represents one steradian is computed as:</p>

<pre><code>θ = A/r^2
</code></pre>

<p>Which, intriguingly, is simply r<sup>2</sup>/r<sup>2</sup>, or has the units <strong>m<sup>2</sup> * m<sup>-2</sup></strong>, which makes a steradian, like the radian, a unitless specification describing a fixed area on the surface of a sphere relative to the sphere's radius.</p>

<p>To complete the definition of a steradian in relation to a sphere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The solid angle of an entire sphere is
  equivalent to 4π sr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One might look at that another way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The surface area of a sphere has the
  unit 4π sr.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Now that the definition of a steradian is out of the way, we can come to a clearer understanding of the relationship of a <em>lumen</em> to a <em>candela</em>. According to the linked wikipedia article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 lm = 1 cd sr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, <em>one lumen</em> is equal to <em>one candela steradian</em>. A candela steradian is the luminous power of light emitted from a steradian, which as we now know from the discussion above, is the area of a circular patch on a sphere equal to the square of the radius of that sphere.</p>

<p>If we bring a light source into the discussion, to make things more real, that would translate into the following. Assuming we have a light bulb with a 1.5"" radius, that meters at 1 lumen, could be described as emitting 1 cd from any area on the surface of that bulb measuring 1.5""<sup>2</sup> (2.25"" total area).</p>

<p>The full light bulb is actually emitting a total of 1 cd 4π sr, or a total of 12.57 lm from all angles. The light meter will not measure 12.57 lm though, because it is only measuring from one angle to the bulb, not all angles to the bulb. If we assume our light meter is effectively sensitive to roughly one steradian, then it will measure 1 lumen.</p>

<p><strong>Further Questions?</strong></p>

<p>Q: One may ask, why equate 1 lumen with 1 candela steradian, rather than just 1 candela? </p>

<p>A: The answer is <em>geometry</em>. Describing a candela is useful in telling us an amount of light, but not necessarily its concentration or the shape and size of the emission. The purpose of bringing steradians into the mix is that it involves a specific geometric shape and area to the light source emitting a lumen of light. </p>

<p>It becomes more important when you have a high density light source.  For example, a low power laser pointer (milliwatts) could equate out to 250,000 w/sr.  Now when you consider density capabilities of say an eye at 120,000 w/sr it become more than trivial -  you see?  Oh wait, you won't see!</p>

<p>According to wikipedia, one <strong>lux</strong> is the measurement of lumens per square meter. In unit terms, since <em>one lm</em> is equal to <em>one cd sr</em>, then:</p>

<pre><code>1 lux = 1 cd sr/m^2
</code></pre>

<p>If I understand correctly, that could be read as 1 lux is equivalent to the amount of light received on a surface illuminated by a light source with a radius of one meter that emits 1 cd sr of luminous power towards the surface measured.</p>

<p>The conversion of lux to EV is a fairly simple one that involves a constant C. I can't say specifically how C is derived, however if we assume that the ""common"" value of 250 is accurate, a simple formula for converting from <em>lux</em> to <em>EV</em> would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EV = log<sub>2</sub>(E*S)/C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where S is the sensor ISO, and E is the illuminance in lux. If we assume a scene is illuminated with 1 lux, and our ISO is 100, then (long hand, translated to base ten logarithm for computation on a common calculator):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EV = log<sub>2</sub> (1 * 100) / 250<br>
  EV = log<sub>2</sub> 100/250<br>
  EV = log<sub>2</sub> 0.4<br>
  EV = log<sub>10</sub> 0.4 / log<sub>10</sub> 2<br>
  EV = -0.398 / 0.301<br>
  EV = -1.322  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A pretty low exposure value, however that would be expected for the measly illumination provided by 1 lux. To go the other way, and figure out how much illumination you need to support a specific EV, we can rearrange the conversion between EV and E (long hand):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EV = log<sub>2</sub> (E<em>S) / C<br>
  2<sup>EV</sup> = 2<sup>log<sub>2</sub> (E</em>S) / C</sup><br>
  2<sup>EV</sup> = E * S/C<br>
  2<sup>EV</sup> * C/S = E * S/C * C/S<br>
  2<sup>EV</sup> * C/S = E<br>
  E = 2<sup>EV</sup> * 250/100  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That brings us to a nice simple formula to compute <em>lux</em> from <em>EV</em> (when ISO is 100):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E = 2<sup>EV</sup> * 2.5  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If our target EV is 1, then we compute lux as so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E = 2<sup>1</sup> * 2.5<br>
  E = 2 * 2.5<br>
  E = 5  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For an exposure of one EV, we need exactly 5 lux of illumination, or 5 cd sr/m^2, or 5 lm/m^2.</p>

<p><strong>Further Questions?</strong></p>

<p>Q: One may ask, why measure lux, which are lm/m^2, rather than simply measure lumens? </p>

<p>A: The answer would be <em>units</em>, or more specifically, units of area that a human can readily recognize. A candela steradian is useful in telling us amount and geometry, however a steradian is unitless itself. It purely defines geometry, but does not specify any specific area. A steradian is a steradian, regardless of the actual radius of the sphere. A <em>candela steradian per meter squared</em>, however, brings in enough unit specificity that we can more clearly understand exactly how much light 1 lux actually is (which, quite frankly, is not much at all.) </p>

<li>Change bit depth of doc <strong>A</strong>

<ul>
<li>Color Lookup layer is removed</li>

<li>Changing bit depth works fine, Color Lookup layer persists across the edit</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Even if this is an expected limitation for those profile types, still looks like a bug due to the lack of feedback to the user (e.g. silently removing the Color Lookup layer when changing bit depth).</p>

The two ""big boys"" seem to be Canon and Nikon. I've looked at both companies, and I can't really see significant differences between the two.</p>

<p>Are there any?</p>

<p>(Please don't go into a flame war here -- I'm looking for factual differences between the cameras, not ""I enjoy X because of Y..."")</p>

<hr>

<p>Also see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/20092/what-do-pentax-sony-and-olympus-dslrs-offer-that-differs-from-canon-and-nikon"">What do Pentax, Sony, and Olympus DSLRs offer that differs from Canon and Nikon?</a>  for another important part of the story. </p>
","<p>There's very few minor differences between those two.  </p>

<p>Nikon has a consistent mount throughout its current generation of amateur and pro DSLR cameras.  If a lens mounts on one, it should mount on the other.  On some entry-level cameras with older lenses, you may not get autofocus and/or metering — but the lens is still functional.  Nikon used to have only autofocus in the body. Some previous generation lenses require a camera with a focus motor in the body to autofocus. Nikon's recent mirrorless CX-mount differs from it's DSLR F-Mount because CX lenses are not intended for use on DSLRs - but official Nikon adapters do exist to mount F lenses on the CX mount.</p>

<p>Canon currently has three mounts: EF, EF-S, and EF-M.  An EF-M lens is designed for a mirrorless camera, and won't physically mount to an EF-S or EF camera.  An EF-S lens is made for a APS-C sized sensor and physically won't mount to a full frame camera, but can be adapted for use on a mirrorless camera. (Based on Matt's comment below, it may also be possible to mount a EF-S lens on a fullframe camera with some modification to the lenses and a limited zoom range.) EF lenses will work on either APS-C or full frame cameras, and can be adapted for use on a mirrorless camera (with the same adapter as for EF-S lenses).  All autofocus Canon lenses have focus motors in the lens.</p>

<p>The off-camera flash system is very different between the two as well.</p>

<p>They each have a few lenses in their arsenal that the other is lacking — extreme macro or adjustable soft focus lenses for example.  But those are really niche cases.</p>

<p>Canon is making their own sensors and Nikon has started to use some Sony sensors that are shared among several cameras (Nikon D7000, Pentax K-5, and Sony A580 all use the same sensor - or very close to it).  The current generation of Sony sensors in these cameras appear to be superior to the <em>current</em> Canon sensors.  Most of the technology advantages between the ""big two"" tends to switch back and forth as they each introduce new generations of cameras - so a sensor advantage today may not exist tomorrow.</p>

<p>Realistically, either would take good pics.</p>

<p>Don't forget about Pentax and Sony as well — they're competing for market share instead of against their own lines and look to be feature packing even their lower level cameras.

"What does a 'nano crystal coat' do on this lens?","12858","","<p>The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003ZSHNE0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikkor 85mm f/1.4G</a> AF-S has a 'Nano Crystal Coat'...what is that and why is it on most of their most expensive lenses?  Obviously its a coating and some links seem to indicate it may <em>increase</em> transmission and sharpness, but it seems counter intuitive to me that coating something will make it sharper.</p>
","<h2><strong>Nanocoating: New and Different!</strong></h2>

<p>To more specifically address the ""Nano Crystal Coating"" type of lens coating, as other answers seem to be either addressing multicoating in general or think nanotechnology coating is just a marketing term.</p>

<p>Nanocoating is actually NOT the same as multicoating, it is very different in design, and affects light in a different way. The use of the term ""Nano Crystal Coating"" is most definitely not just a marketing term! To start as simple as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Multicoating</em> is an advancement on the concept of singlecoating, and is designed on the basis of waveform interference. 

<ul>
<li>Works by ""tuning"" reflected light in such a way that the reflected 
particles waveforms cancel each other out. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Nanocoating</em> is a much newer concept, intriguingly based on the structure and design of moth eyes (which barely reflect any light at all.)

<ul>
<li>Designed to avoid reflection in the first place, and guide light rays into the lens without allowing them to reflect at all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Multicoating and Waveform Interference</strong></h2>

<p>Light exhibits both particle and waveform properties. As such, two photons can interact in such a way as to cancel each other out. This is best demonstrated with illustration, and I'll borrow a wikipedia image for that purpose. Below is an example of a single-coated lens, and how the coating produces reflected photon waveforms that are in opposition to each other (and therefor capable of canceling each other out):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wGESe.png"" alt=""single-coating""></p>

<p>The anti-reflective coating is designed to be exactly as thick as half the wavelength of the frequency of light. Light will reflect <em>at every intersection</em> of material, such as between the air &amp; coating as well as coating &amp; lens. Since the coating is as thick as half the wavelength of light, the reflection from the air/coating interface negatively interferes with the reflection from the coating/lens interface, and the two cancel each other.</p>

<p>Multicoating works the same way, however with multiple layers of coating at different thicknesses. Since the color of light is determined by its wavelength, coating a lens with several layers of exactly half the wavelength of key frequencies of light (such as violet, blue, blue-green, green, yellow-green, yellow, orange, red) will cancel out considerably more light than a simple single-coating will. Single coatings were generally designed in the green to yellow-green band of light, as they tend to be most prevalent in sunlight and daylight. Multicoating is intended to work on a the full spectrum as much as possible. </p>

<h2><strong>Deficiencies of Multicoating</strong></h2>

<p>The advent of multicoating was a huge breakthrough in terms of lens transmission (the amount of light they allow to pass), reaching levels as high as 99%. Multicoating is not ideal, though. When strong flare and ghosting do occur, they are only capable of entirely filtering out light reflected at the exact wavelengths each layer is designed to filter out. Wavelengths near the intended frequencies will be mitigated, however they will not be entirely canceled. A bright off-axis non-incicent beam of light, such as from the sun in the corner of a frame, can still create large, bright, and very detrimental flare, ghosting, and contrast reduction even on a lens with multicoating.</p>

<p>Additionally, multicoating is simply taking advantage of a property of light to use a negative property of lenses...reflectance...to minimize the impact that reflectance has on image quality. As such, transmission is not ideal, and up to several percent of incident light can be lost for any given wavelength, usually resulting in <em>1-2% total loss</em> in transmission <strong>PER COATED ELEMENT/GROUP</strong>. Granted, that is far lower than the 8-10% that used to exist with single coating and uncoated lenses, however in complex lenses with many elements, a considerable amount of light can still be lost overall (i.e. a complex 15 group telephoto lens could end up with <em>15-30% loss</em> in total transmission in the face of strong flare.) </p>

<h2><strong>Improvements with Nanocoating</strong></h2>

<p>Nanocoating, unlike multicoating, is not a continued evolution of a previous technology...it is indeed an entirely new approach to solving an old problem. Nanocoating is based on the design of moth eyes, which are known in the scientific community to have one of the lowest reflectance indexes of any material. The general design is based on nano-scale roughly dome/spike-like structures intended to guide as much light as possible into the lens, avoiding reflectance entirely whenever possible. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qpjec.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If and when flare or ghosting does occur, since nanocoating is not designed to work on any given wavelength of light but light in totality, the resulting artifacts or loss of contrast is considerably less than with a multicoated lens. In many cases, careful and close scrutiny is required to find small elements of flare and ghosting in photo taken with a nanocoated lens, and when it does exist, it often does not detrimentally affect IQ.</p>

<p>Transmission levels for nanocoating are at least <strong>99.95% PER COATED ELEMENT/GROUP</strong>. At a lost of 0.05% or less, the grand total transmission loss for any lens, even complex lenses with many element groups, will remain very low (i.e. a complex 15 group telephoto lens would end up with a total of <em>0.75% transmission loss</em>.) </p>

<h2><strong>Design of a Lens Nanocoating</strong></h2>

<p>(NOTE: The exact nature of light that passes through a nanocoat is not widely publicized, so I can only base my explanation here off of what I have seen and read. I am not claiming 100% accuracy, however I think it is generally accurate enough.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQWzj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The design of the illustration above is taken from a few of the SWC, or <em>Subwavelenth Structure Coating</em>, diagrams I have found on Canon's websites. In comparison to Nikon's Nano Crystal Coating, Canon's SWC is the same thing, although their specific implementation may differ in the details. Canon explicitly calls out the ""wedge shape"" of the nano-scale structures, and calls out the pseudo-layered nature with wedges of differing size and height. The size and thickness of the structure layer is explicitly designed to be considerably smaller than the wavelengths of visible light used for most photography (around 200nm at the largest, where as the wavelengths of visible light range from 380nm to 790nm or so).</p>

<p>The technological purpose for using such a structure is to eliminate the primary cause of reflection: <strong><em>Large changes</strong> in refractive index</em> at material boundaries. Replacing layered multicoating, which creates many interfaces where there could be large changes in refractive index, with a structured coating where there is no single <em>interface</em>  thereby creating a ""smooth transition"" layer. The thickness of the layer is kept small, presumably to minimize the impact to angle of incidence of rays that pass through it (don't actually have any specifically concrete information about why wedges are kept so small.) </p>

<p>Light is effectively ""guided in"" through the nanostructure layer into the lens element. The ultimate goals is for light to pass through the nano-structure elements and enter the lens element in the spaces between wedges, largely ""unscathed"". The amount of reflection is minimal, and what reflection does occur usually reflects off of the nano-structure/element interface where one exists. When light reflects off of an internal lens element and back up to a previous element, the same nano-structure coating will have the same effect on that reflected light, helping it pass through the internal elements to either diffuse harmlessly off the low-reflectivity innards of the lens, or right back out the front element...little to no harm done.</p>

<h2><strong>Better Sharpness?</strong></h2>

<p>Regarding whether nanocoating allows for improved sharpness. I would not be inclined to say that the nanocoating itself can really improve sharpness a whole lot. It certainly improves transmission, such that in lenses with lots of element groups, the total transmission loss is reduced from several percent to usually under, often well under, one percent. In terms of overall IQ improvement, the improved transmission should also improve contrast, even at a microcontrast level. Improved microcontrast will lead to improvements in sharpness, to some degree.</p>

<p>The claim to improved sharpness is more likely due to more freedom in lens design, and the ability to utilize more lens elements a lens designer might otherwise be limited to due to transmission requirements. If you can only use 8 lens elements with multicoating because more would reduce overall light transmission too much, you might be able to use 15 or more with a nanocoating and still have far better transmission characteristics. That offers lens designers the freedom to implement greater control over image reproduction than in the past, which should ultimately lead to improved sharpness.</p>

<p>I believe that is exactly the case with newer Canon lenses, largely ""Mark II"" generation or ""new entrants"" such as the <strong>EF 8-15mm f/4 L Fisheye</strong> lens. It is probably also the case with Nikon lenses with NCC. Canon's newer lenses are significantly outperforming their predecessors in the area of MTF (Modulation Transfer Function, a way of measuring the sharpness and contrast of a lens). Almost all of Canon's L-series lenses introduced since around the middle of 2008 (possible a little earlier than that) that use SWC have theoretical MTF's (most lens manufacturers these days generate MTF charts from computer models of lenses) demonstrating significant jumps on overall resolution, sharpness, and contrast, with some demonstrating nearly ""perfect"" results according to the criterion of their MTF (which is admittedly lower than most of their lenses should actually be capable of resolving, but consistent in terms of comparison with MTF's of older lenses.)</p>

<p>So, technically, it is not the coating itself that directly improves sharpness (although as it improves contrast it may have a slight direct impact). Improvements to sharpness are more likely due to the ability to make improvements in lens design without as much concern for transmission as in the past. (I guess that could be either corroborated or refuted by comparing the lens designs of new lenses with nanocoatings vs old lenses without.)</p>

"Does leaving the Canon 7D sharpness setting at zero make images worse or better?","12837","","<p>Do you know if leaving the sharpness setting to zero makes the image worse or better.  I find that putting it to 7 makes it ""sharp"" but something seems artificial with it when I review the images.  Does this make a difference if you're shooting RAW anyways?</p>

<p>I have a 24-105 L and usually shoot it at f/4.0 and around 24mm.</p>

<p>Is there a sharpness setting that works best for anyone?</p>
","<p>If you read the <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EOS-7D-Digital-SLR-Camera-Review.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7D Review</a> at The-Digital-Picture you see that Bryan Carnathan makes quite a few references to the need to increase the sharpness setting to ""2"" or ""3"" to match the output of many of Canon's other models (at the time the review was written). He attributes it to a stronger anti-alias filter. This makes sense as the 4.3µ pixel pitch on the 7D's sensor is tighter, and thus a higher frequency, than the other models he compares it to.</p>

<p>When shooting with my 7D I normally select the ""Standard"" picture style which includes a sharpness setting of ""3"". After importing the RAW file to <em>Digital Photo Professional (DPP)</em> this setting is used to initially display the photo. In general, I sharpen using the 'Unsharpen Mask' tool which replaces the in camera sharpening setting with the parameters I choose when the file is converted to JPEG or TIFF. Of course this is done non-destructively by adding a set of instructions to the file. The original setting is still attached to the file as well and can be restored by clicking the Return arrow to the right of the Picture Style heading on the tool palette (Even if you open a copy of the file made after you changed the settings later on a different computer).</p>

<p>Your final sharpen settings should be determined by the display size you intend for the image.</p>

<p>See also <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/27083/recommended-start-point-for-sharpening-raw-images"">Recommended start point for sharpening RAW Images</a>. <strong>There are a lot of variables that will ultimately determine your sharpening settings.

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of negative film versus reversal film?","12829","","<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of negative/print film compared to reversal/slide film?</p>
","<p>I started with (color) negative film then switched to slide film for one specific reason: I wanted control over my pictures. With negatives, unless you develop and print yourself (which is a convoluted process for color film), when you drop your film at the local shop, you have almost no control over the look of your prints (exposure, contrast). And with negative film, it's hard to judge how good your picture is without a print (negative has crazy colors).</p>

<p>With slides, it's very simple: the process is the same for all slide film, the result is always the same, and the slide you see is 100% your picture, your work. If you under- or over-expose (on purpose or by mistake), it's your work, not that of the machine that made your prints. Plus, colors on slides, especially saturated films (eg. Velvia), looks worlds better (to me), but that's a matter of taste.</p>

<p>Also, when developing slide film, prints are extra, but I don't spend money for any print up front: I select those pictures I like and scan them, they can be printed like any digital picture.</p>

<p>On the downside, slide film is much less forgiving of bad exposure: when light is very contrasted, you have to choose if you sacrifice highlights or shadows (similar to digital), while negative film can take more contrast. It's also getting hard to find slide film in brick-and-mortar shops (I buy all of mine online), so when travelling you better bring enough film. Also, scanning film to have prints is more work, and good scanners for slide or film are more expensive than entry level scanners.</p>

"What is the difference between a soft and sharp image?","12774","","<p>I have seen several questions talking about images being soft or sharp. What is the difference? Is soft simply the opposite of sharp in this context, or is there something more to it?</p>

<p>Sample images would probably help a lot.</p>
","<p><strong>Sharpness is the opposite of softness but there is a whole spectrum between them.</strong> In a soft image, details are less pronounced which means that the difference between adjacent pixels is smaller. Conversely, when an image is sharper there is more contrast between pixels which is sometimes referred to as micro-contrast as opposed to overall image contrast.</p>

<p><strong>The level of sharpness depends on the entire system</strong>, not just the lens but also the anti-alias filter all the way to the method used to interpolate colors from sensors which use a color-filter array (Non-Foveon sensors basically).</p>

<p><strong>Check out <a href=""http://www.neocamera.com/camera/pentax/k5/samples/sharpness"" rel=""noreferrer"">this demo from the Pentax K-5 review</a></strong>. The K-5 and K-7 have the most sophisticated sharpness control of any digital camera. Sharpness is controlled in 9 steps on one of 3 scales. The default position is 0 but if you select -4 at the bottom scale you will see a very soft image. If you select +4 you will see a sharp image. Note that the setting of +4 is what people call over-sharpened which means the contrast between adjacent pixels was increased so much that artifacts are introduced (just look at the edge of the parenthesis on the left).</p>

<p>You can also select another scale and see the difference between the <em>Sharpness</em> and the <em>Fine Sharpness</em> or even <em>Extra Fine Sharpness</em> scales. These use different sharpening parameters which are designed to work on different levels of details. At the extreme of the <em>Extra Fine Sharpness</em> scale, it even sharpens noise!</p>

<p>What is really interesting is that <strong>this is the same image which you can see with different levels of sharpness</strong>. Only one shot was taken and it was developped in-camera from DNG to JPEG uses all possible sharpness settings. Of course, the sharpness you start with and how much you get out of it depends on the quality of the lens used. Some lenses inherently produce softer results which you can sharpen by software but limits to how far you can go without introducing nasty artifacts. Even worse is that the sharpness of a lens is not uniform so will usually by highest in the center and also changes with the selected aperture.</p>

"Difference between PNG and RAW, other than compression?","12766","","<p>I know that many professional cameras shoot in RAW. PNG has lossless compression which would allow cameras to save more shots than RAW. This leads me to wonder if there's anything special about RAW that makes it save more data than PNG.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with the RAW format and I don't come from a photography background. I have asked several people with professional cameras that shot in RAW and they weren't too sure, but they seemed to to think that RAW saved more actual data than PNG. Is this true? What, if anything, makes RAW better than PNG, and if there's no difference, why don't cameras shoot in PNG instead of RAW?</p>
","<p>The RAW formats store, well, the raw sensor data from the camera with information on how to decode that for image processors such as Adobe Camera Raw or similar. In that sense, the RAW format is not an image, you have to apply demosaicing algorithms to interpret the sensor data into a coherent image for display. Beyond the Adobe attempt to convince everyone to use DNG (Digital Negative) as their format, there is no standard for the storage of RAW image data and most camera makers have their own. However, what is standard in all RAW formats is the EXIF data which provides a lot of information about the state of the camera settings at the time of the shot.</p>

<p>PNG, on the other hand, was devised initially as an alternative to GIF without all of the patent pain that the latter carried, mostly as a result of the compression algorithm. It's since grown up quite a bit, from original intention, but it wasn't really devised for photography as such. The biggest gap, for example, is the lack of EXIF data, a requirement for camera equipment. The other big issue is that it would be the end result of the interpretation of the sensor data, so you would lose the signal information of the sensor at that point and can no longer re-interpret the information with better or alternative algorithms. Effectively, you become stuck with the interpretation of the developer who wrote the algorithm. That's not alway desired.</p>

"Does the selection of sRGB or Adobe RGB in camera when shooting RAW ever matter?","12732","","<p>I shoot RAW essentially 100% of the time, and have the in-camera color space setting at AdobeRGB (sRGB is also offered). The raw converter in turn is set to produce sRGB output files. As I understand the process, the general flow is for raw shooting: raw sensor data readout (including A/D conversion), compression, write to a raw file, then in post-processing rather than in-camera apply color space/color temperature/etc; for JPEG shooting: raw sensor data readout, apply color space/color temperature/etc, JPEG compression, write to memory card (in camera).</p>

<p>Hence, when a colleague said that I should leave the <em>camera</em> set to sRGB for best/consistent results despite using the camera's raw format, it didn't really make much sense to me. I have mulled it over for a while now and it still doesn't really make any sense.</p>

My question is, <em>when shooting RAW</em>, does it ever matter (except for the image preview) whether the camera is set to sRGB or AdobeRGB? If it does, then why, and in what situations? Is my understanding of the ""raw"" format processing chain flawed?</p>

You're right, it doesn't matter at all in how the image is recorded or stored.</p>

<p>As you note, the selected color space applies to the preview image and to the histogram. The camera also <em>may</em> make metering decisions intended to avoid clipping (overexposing to the full saturation point) in particular channels, and that <em>may</em> be affected by choice of color space in-camera. I think this is less likely to be a real problem than having the white balance far off might be, though.</p>

<p>But I'd also take a careful look at the preview image in both modes. The rear LCD screen isn't something you can calibrate on most cameras. I think it's more likely that sRGB is correctly represented, and the screen might not cover the Adobe RGB gamut very well. (And really, I'd not be surprised if many cameras don't really handle preview display of Adobe RGB correctly at all — that's a lot more complicated than simply having the mechanism to save in that space.) I'd do some test shots and see which looks most like what your final printed output does, and then use that — that'll make the review screen more useful. It may very well turn out that an accurate display of sRGB is more like your final results than a bad rendition of Adobe RGB (even if you ultimately <em>do</em> use Adobe RGB in the end).</p>

"What is the technical difference between focus and zooming?","12691","","<p>This may look like a silly question but I don't know what the difference between zooming and focusing is. Zooming in will usually let me have fewer subjects in the scene while zooming out will allow for wider view. Focusing is the process adjusting the wanted subject to be in focus and look sharp. When we zoom, lens elements are moved to zoom in or out, what happens in the lens when we change the focus?</p>
","<p>The two generally control two different aspects of the image projected by the lens. Focusing sometimes has the effect of changing ""zoom"" a little as well, however its purpose is different. To keep it simple:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong> adjusts the <strong>Focal Plane</strong>

<ul>
<li>The focal plane is the thin plane of reality that is focused clearly on the imaging medium</li>
<li>Focusing moves this plane nearer or farther from the camera's sensor/film</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong> adjusts the <strong>Angle of View</strong>

<ul>
<li>The angle of view is the breadth of the scene projected by the lens</li>
<li>Wide-angle lenses tend to capture very broad scenes (large angle of view)</li>
<li>Telephoto lenses tend to capture very narrow scenes (small angle of view)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Focusing in the past used to be achieved by moving the lens itself (i.e. in a large-format view camera) forward or backward (away/towards the imaging medium). This often results in changes to the angle of view as well, since the total focal length of the lens can change via extension...sometimes by a lot. In modern camera lenses, focusing may be achieved similarly...many cheap lenses focus by moving the front or back (or both) lens elements. Higher quality lenses tend to use an internal floating focus group, an internal group of lens elements who's sole purpose is to focus the image. The benefit of internal focusing groups is that the physical length of the lens stays the same, allowing you to minimize the amount of ""zoom shift"" that might occur when focusing.</p>

"Canon Zoom lenses: 18-135 STM vs 18-200 vs. 17-85","12643","","<p>In my quest to buy a new camera, My local store has three bundles, that each comes with one of the three lenses mentioned in the title. I'm having a hard time deciding between the three as they all have relatively the same pros and cons. So I'm going to deligate this decision making to you based on the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The frame will either be a 60D or T4i (650D)</li>
<li>Price isn't an issue when comparing the bundles</li>
<li>My other lenses are 50mm 1.8, sigma 10-20, and canon 100mm 2.8 macro. I also have the kit 18-55 and 75-300</li>
<li>I've shot with the 17-85 and 18-200 before and I like them both</li>
<li>80% of my shots are Landscapes, 10% macro, and 10% everything else.</li>
<li>I'm primarily looking for a lens I can walk with while on travel, and/or put as a secondary lens on my second frame.</li>
<li>My criteria in order: Image Quality (opened wide, sharpness, distortion, and aberration, AF speed at low light, and versatility (Do panoramas, portraits, street shots, etc, as the situation requires).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
","<p>For a general purpose, high IQ, fast AF, low light lens the <strong>17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM</strong> is the obvious choice. It's not cheap, but its a step up from any of those on offer.</p>

<p>If you must choose one of those on offer, I'd probably get the 18-135mm STM for general walk-around but I don't think any will be as sharp or as good in low light as the 17-55mm f/2.8. I think the 18-135mm is a little sharper and faster to focus than the others, and it sounds like you're not too fussed about the long end (so 135mm is an OK compromise).</p>

<p>The 18-200 will probably outperform your 75-300 in the range where they overlap, so if you're wanting to replace the 18-55 and 75-300 in one go, that might be a better choice. Or if you want higher IQ, and are happy carrying more weight, you're better off with the 17-55mm f/2.8 and one of Canon's excellent 70-200L or 70-300L lenses.</p>

<p>I have a personal dislike for the 17-85mm because its similar length to the 17-55 but nowhere near the image quality. The 15-85mm is much better than the 17-85mm (and I thought that was Canon's replacement in the kits for the 17-85), as its quite sharp and extends your 'standard' 18-55mm range a little into the ultra-wide and a little into the telephoto ranges (for when you might need either of the 10-20 or 75-300 but aren't sure and can't be bothered carrying all three).</p>

<p>Olympus doesn't currently offer a normal prime, though — there's a wide-angle 17mm (equivalent to the traditional 35mm focal length) and a portrait-range 45mm, both of which look nice, but there's no 25mm.</p>

<p>But, Panasonic offers the drool-worthy <a href=""http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/H-X025"" rel=""noreferrer"">Panasonic Leica DG Summilux 25mm f/1.4 ASPH</a>. I know Micro Four Thirds is a shared, semi-open standard — but there's compatible and then there's <em>compatible</em>. Even the best specifications have areas of ambiguity, and camera makers have the most incentive to test compatibility between their own products. With a modern electronic lens mount, where the lens itself has a microprocessor and its own firmware, it seems like there's a lot of potential for things to go subtly awry.</p>

<p>If I get this combo, will I be giving the camera a fair test, or will I find myself struggling with quirks that I wouldn't have if I stuck with Olympus lenses? Will there be any problems with focusing speed, image stabilization, or the like? (And of course, there's the flip question: if I want to use that lens, is a Panasonic camera the best place to attach it?)</p>
","<p>I have an Olympus body (E-PL1) and a Panasonic lens (100-300mm zoom), and haven't noticed any special problems.

<p><em>It depends on the camera.

Can someone please explain to me how I can ""fully wind on"" my camera ? </p>
","<p>First option</p>

<p>You are simply at the end of the roll. Press the film release button and rewind the film.</p>

<p>If you can't do that, open the camera in the dark, remove the film, and rewind it manually. Maybe you can discern the problem in the dark. If you don't care about exposing the film, you can simply open the camera to inspect for a loading error.</p>

<p>Second option</p>

<p>Press the film release button that you press to wind the film. This should also allow you to cock the shutter. It's normal to wind up in your predicament at the end of the film. If it happens at some other time, you may have a loading error. Note that if you cock the shutter after pressing the film release button, the shutter will be cocked but the film will not be advanced. If you shoot a picture, you will get a double exposure with the previous shot.</p>

"Can I fine tune the autofocus on my Canon 60D to be more accurate?","12605","","<p>I noticed that some of my lenses auto-focus more accurately then others. (Assume perfect light conditions and fast shutter speed) Zooming-in on say the center focus point (if only the center focus point has been used) sometimes reveals that the lens overshoot or undershoot the focus just ever so slightly.  I also almost always get a better and sharper image when focusing manually (and breathing correctly). I mean the autofocus is not bad (seems best on my prime 50mm lens, less perfect on my 70-200mm telephoto) but not perfect. </p>

<p>I might now be thinking this up as I write along but If I remember correctly I've read somewhere that the Canon 50D body has some kind of an feature that can fine tune the AF for differently for different lenses.   </p>

","<p>You adjust focus on the camera - not the lens.  The Canon 60D does not have a micro focus adjustment needed to do this.  </p>

<p>You may try sending in your camera and lenses in for adjustment together, but it is not something you can adjust yourself on that body.</p>

<p>If your 70-200 is significantly slower in max aperture than your 50mm, then it likely doesn't autofocus as well because of the slower aperture.  More light = better autofocus.</p>

"How to calculate viewing distance for a print size?","12582","","<p>I'm working on a photomontage (35mm landscape).  The client is asking for what size they should print it at and what is the viewing distance.</p>

<p>I'm planning to print the final image on either A1 or A2 sized paper.</p>

<p>I have read numerous guides on how to work out the viewing distance.  But none of them make much sense. <a href=""http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/PDF/Contribute/LIPhotographyAdviceNote01-11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The advice note</a> from the Landscape Institute suggests it is not guess work by I'm more confused by it.</p>

<p>The Diagonal x 1.5 rule seems to produce a large viewing distance.  I thought a value of around 400mm for an A1 print would be more suitable, but looking for a way calculate it rather than guessing it.
Any help is appreciated.</p>
","<p>The viewing distance of an image is based on two factors; first is the diagonal image size and second are the pixels per inch required at that distance to give a sharp image.</p>

<p>Firstly the rough rule of thumb is that the viewing distance should be 1.5 to 2 times the diagonal length. This will give you an optimal viewing distance for the overall printed size based on the human eye's ideal viewing angle. You have to understand, however, that for a landscape this may not be optimal as you may actually want the viewer to pan around the image, and you may want the size of features within the image to be the basis of this calculation. This is an artistic decision though, based on the composition of your image.</p>

<p>Secondly for the image to look good at the distance you choose, there need to be sufficient pixels per inch (ppi) to fool the eye into seeing a smooth image that isn't pixelated. The minimum ppi needed for a print with acceptable quality is calculated by dividing the value 3438 by the viewing distance. Anything above this ppi will look good at the distance chosen.</p>

<p>So: <strong>minimum ppi = 3438/Viewing Distance</strong></p>

<p>where 3438, a constant for human vision, was derived as follows:</p>

<p>1/ppi = 2 x Viewing Distance x tan(0.000290888/2)</p>

<p>1/ppi = Viewing Distance x tan(0.000290888)</p>

<p>ppi = 3438/Viewing Distance</p>

<p>where 0.000290888 radians (1 arc minute) is known as the '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">visual acuity</a> angle' and represents how much resolution a human can see.</p>

The reason for this is so they can fit Portrait slots in a multi picture frame. I have chosen these pictures, as they have central focal points (such as a church), and nothing much at the edges of the pictures. The tools I have at my disposal are, Microsoft Office Picture manager 2010, and the photo printer at my local supermarket. I realise that I should only need to get the ratio correct, but is there an easy way to make sure my photos still look good once I have alter them? The pictures are of good quality and size (2048 v 1536), so the editing and stretching shouldn't mess up the quality when printed.</p>
","<p>Your best bet is probably to crop the photos when printing, especially if you are unfamiliar with editing photos on your PC. Most of the photo terminals at supermarkets I've seen have had the ability to let you rotate and crop photos.</p>

<p>You will lose resolution when doing this, to avoid pixelation when printing you really need 300ppi (pixels per inch) for a reasonable viewing distance you can get away with 200 or 150 <em>absolute minimum</em>. At 200ppi you could print your images 10""x7.5"" whereas cropped to portrait that goes down to 7.5""x5.75""</p>

<p>Assuming the images were sharp to begin with you should be able to get away with printing them 7x5.</p>

<p>The only thing you need to do to preserve quality when rotating and cropping is to save the images back using the highest possible JPEG quality setting (as JPEG is a ""lossy"" format you lose data every time you save) or use a lossless format like PNG, TIFF (some labs wont support these however). That's one advantage of doing the rotation/crop yourself, as you have full control unlike the machine at the lab.</p>

"Why do some professional cameras have dual memory card slots?","12527","","<p>I have noticed that some cameras such as the <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25464/D300S.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikon D300s</a>, <a href=""http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_1d_mark_iv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon EOS 1D Mark IV</a>, or <a href=""http://www.pentaximaging.com/slr/645D_Limited_Edition/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pentax 645D</a> have dual memory card slots. </p>

<p>What is the purpose of having multiple memory card slots and why would you want them?</p>
","<p>Professional cameras such as the Canon 1D Mark IV have dual memory card slots for a variety of professional use cases. I will break them down into three main groupings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mirroring</strong> of the image across multiple cards for redundancy</li>
<li><strong>Automatic switching to a second card</strong> after the first one reaches capacity</li>
<li><strong>Ability to write different file formats</strong> to different memory cards</li>
</ul>

<h2>Speed, Redundancy, and Buffers</h2>

<p>A theme across the three groupings can be realized, where you will find speed, redundancy and the cameras use of the buffer all play a role. It comes down to what is the most important aspect of your photography, and where do you place your priorities. </p>

<p>If you consider speed to be your number one goal(which it may be if you chose a high end body that has the dual memory card slot feature) then you may want to choose the ability to write different formats. This will prevent the camera from doubling the data going through it on every shot as in the case of mirroring the image.
If redundancy and near 100% image preservation is your highest priority, you likely want to mirror the image to both memory cards. 
If you are more casual about your redundancy and or speed is not the highest priority, you may choose the convenience of having the camera switch to the second memory card when the first fills up.</p>

<h2>Other points to consider</h2>

<p>If your camera only uses compact flash cards, it will not currently allow use of an Eye-Fi adapter for wireless transmission of images. If the dual memory card support adds an SD card slot, this may be an additional advantage. </p>

<p>There was a time when some cameras came with dual memory card slots to help consumers switch between competing formats, such as xD, Memory Stick(Sony), Compact Flash, etc. These early implementations were not designed in the same way as today's professional dual memory card slots, they were simply to ease the transition for consumers between formats.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers have additional features specific to them, such as Nikon's ability to write video to one memory type and photos to another, or Canon's ability to accept both Compact Flash Type I and II cards.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall the dual memory card slots add professional level options that further enhance the photographic possibilities. If you are interested in the fastest possible speed, data redundancy or work in poor weather conditions - these features will provide enhanced opportunties. They do add an amount of additional size to the camera bodies, but for most professionals using these bodies, the features are welcomed or even necessary.</p>

"Nikon Coolpix P510 - Recommended low-light settings?","12515","","<p>My wife was recently given a Nikon Coolpix P510 as a birthday present from her parents, primarily so we can take a - I believe the technical term is ""****load"" - of pictures of our new baby girl (their first granddaughter). She had wanted a DSLR, primarily for the ""press the shutter button and the thing will actually <em>take a picture</em> instead of thinking about it until the moment's gone"" aspect, but I think this is a good compromise between the cell-phone and cheap pocket cameras we've been used to and the $800 Nikon DSLR her parents have. </p>

<p>We've become especially enamored with the cute poses our daughter gets into when sleeping in her crib (since she's learned to roll over, she's become a side sleeper, and she's also taken to snuggling with her stuffed bunny), and I've taken many pictures of her with just the light from a 60W-equiv 2800K CFL in a floor lamp in the opposite corner for ambient; no fill flash (she is asleep after all).</p>

<p>I'm having some trouble making it look ""real"", matching the exposure level and color temperature to what we see naturally. I have a basic working knowledge of the concepts of film speed, exposure time and aperture, but pretty much all my practical experience playing with them have been with this camera.  My best attempts have been at ISO 1600 film speed equiv, with the shutter between 1/4"" and 1/8"", and maximum aperture for the zoom level (typically about 4-5). With those settings, my baby looks nice and pink and healthy, and not yellow or grey, but the shots look like they were taken with the overhead lights on (too bright and too white). Lowering the film speed to ISO 800 requires crazy shutter lengths (a second or more) which really gives the anti-shake a workout, and she looks yellowish. Lowering the shutter time past 1/10"" underexposes even the ISO 1600 equiv, making the entire shot too grey when compensated. I have 3200 and 6400 equiv settings, but most reviews have said to stay away from them because they're unusably noisy.</p>

<p>What do you think the problem might be? Am I fighting the camera's auto-white-balance (currently just set to ""auto"")? Am I dancing around the edges of the proper settings (unfortunately there isn't an ISO 1000-1200 setting so I've been trying to compensate for film speed with exposure time)? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's the best shot light-wise from the session. No, the crib is not broken; the framing of the shot a little wonky cause I was free-handing the camera while squatting down at the level of her crib mattress pointing it through the bars while trying not to wake her; sue me. As stated earlier, the sole light source in the room is one warm white 60W-equiv CFL in a floor lamp to the right and downrange. Except for the shadowing, this shot almost looks like we have the main light fixture of the room turned on, which speaks wonders for the camera's low-light capabilities, and really brings out her face, but overall it's a bit too much for the desired shot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EnxOa.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>... but when I lower the shutter time to get a more realistic overall light level, her face goes yellow-gray:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K16tY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I know that it doesn't help that the light source is opposite her face so I have to rely on indirect scatter, but for a shot like this I have to work with what I'm given.</p>

<p>The 800-speed shots from this session apparently weren't worth uploading so I don't have an example.</p>
","<p>There are two main ""issues"" here. One is white balance and one is exposure. </p>

<p>It sounds like you have a pretty good plan of attack on the exposure front, you have a good grasp on shutter speed, apeture, and ISO. I think you are doing the right things here, the only two other things that would give you more flexibility and image quality would be using a tripod, and providing more off camera lighting. Your camera doesn't have an option to add an additional flash unit, but you can add additional ambient that is the same color temperature as the 60W that you already have.</p>

<p>The second issue is white balance. Your camera does not have an option to choose a RAW format, that would allow you to adjust the white balance later on a computer. So you really need to get the white balance right in camera. This may mean choosing something other than auto white balance. It might also mean removing some lighting pieces to prevent mixture of different temperature light. Mixing florescent, incoming window light, and on camera flash can be very difficult. I would suggest trying to have one good light source, such as large window(turn off room lights) - or close the window completely and have make sure to have enough similar light to expose properly(maybe 2-3 lamps).</p>

<p>Having the body on M and lens on A doesn't make sense.  Neither does body on A, lens on M really (but see comments), so I'd recommend you just set them both the same.</p>

"How to store and preserve film negatives and slides?","12447","","<p>I bought 35mm dedicated film scanner (Nikon CoolScan III) and I'm planning to digitize old negatives and slides I found at home.</p>

<p><strong>How should I store and preserve these slides and films after I cut them and scan?</strong> How to choose best negative pages/sleeves, binders etc. and what to avoid?</p>
","<p>When I made the 'final' switch from film to digital several years ago, here's the procedure I went through with all my slides and negatives (more than 50,000 frames in total):</p>

<ol>
<li>Digitized every single slide and negative at the highest level of quality available at the time. My intention from the start was to hopefully never to have to break into the physical packaging ever again.</li>
<li>Put all the slides and negatives in polyester sleeves</li>
<li>Tagged and labeled everything into a spreadsheet on the off-chance I'd need to find a negative (or a session) again I wouldn't have to go through every single negative looking for the one I needed.</li>
<li>Taped the sleeves onto archival quality (acid free) cardboard backing</li>
<li>Put the polyester sleeves + a silica pack into an archival grade vacuum seal bag (polypropylene) and used an industrial vacuum sealer to suck all the air out of each package (the cardboard was essentially in there so that the package wouldn't lose it's shape with the vacuum and crush my negatives).</li>
<li>The sealed packages were then placed in archival grade boxes, more silica packs were added to each box, I sealed each box with tape, and the boxes were put in a safety deposit box at a bank in my town with a reputation for keeping the ambient temperature and humidity at a rock-solid 55 degrees/50% humidity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overkill? Probably. Expensive? Definitely. Time consuming? It took nearly 6 months (I probably could have done it faster with some concentrated effort, but it was an 'assemble them while I sit in front of the TV during the down-times' activity)</p>

<p>My kids will probably simply throw them all out after I'm dead... It's not like I've got a bunch of 'undiscovered shots of JFK and Marylin Monroe' floating around in there... But I'm a worry-wart, and I just didn't want to keep myself up nights 'listening to my negatives turn to dust,' so I went for the 'nuclear option' of archival... Or at least as close to a 'nuclear option' as I could imagine at the time. I still occasionally think that it might have been better if I also vacuum sealed the boxes too... But I'm probably just being paranoid. :-)</p>

"How can I get a good HDR image from a single RAW file?","12403","","<p>I've heard that it's possible to create an HDR image from a single RAW file. (Obviously, it won't be as good as using multiple bracketed RAW files; I know that much.)</p>

<p>Every time I try — using Photomatix with the default settings -- the results are truly awful. I'm not even trying for something printable, I mean it's too noisy, blotchy and generally horrible even for viewing onscreen.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any tips — either about what kind of RAW files will work well, or about how to tweak the Photomatix settings for this case, or about other software which will do this better?</p>
","<p>Ideally you want to capture at least 3 distinct images, but the more properly exposed your single raw image is, the better the outcome.</p>

<p>By proper exposure (a subjective term), I mean to expose to the right. You want to capture as much detail in the shadow areas of your image, without blowing out the highlights. The way dSLR CMOS sensors work, they do a much better job capturing information in an image that is slightly overexposed, than with an image that is underexposed (shadow areas will have more noise).</p>

<p>When you have your single RAW file, you want to hopefully create at least three images with varying exposure levels. Depending on your base image, these exposures may be -2/0/+2 EV or -1/0/+1 EV (as Marc's answer (and image shows)), or some variation of three exposure values--one that is less than your base image, and one that is more than your base image. You will need to play with the EV values until you get the intuition on what EV values will work with your base image.</p>

<p>When using Photomatix, try playing with the settings, the default values were never good. IIRC, bumping up the strength to full, and then tweaking from there produced good results.</p>

<p>I seem to recall this works in Bridge. Is there a different way to go about it in Lightroom?</p>
","<p>When bulk tagging, you need to make sure you are in library mode, AND that you are selecting photos from the main grid, not the film strip. I think this is a bug in LR3, however if you select multiple photos from the film strip, and then try to tag them, the tagging does not always take. It usually applies to the first photo selected, but not the rest. There seems to be a threshold to this...if you select only a few images in the film strip, it may work, but more than say 8-10, and it usually does not.</p>

Just remember to hit the enter (return) key in the keyword box before moving on to make certain the update is actually applied to all of the selected images.

Selecting this, it defaults to Keywords. Just enter the keywords you want to add, then click on the images you wish to add the keywords to. You can either click each image individually, or click and grad the spray can over multiple images in a continuous stream to ""paint"" on the new keywords.

"What filters will work with an ultra wide angle lens (for landscape)?","12382","","<p>I just got a Nikon 10-24mm lens that I'll be using on my D90 (DX) lens. I expect to be using it a lot outdoors for landscape shots.</p>

<p>In general, I know what kinds of filters would help landscape photography:</p>

<ul>
<li>UV/Clear, for general protection</li>
<li>Polarizer, for cutting reflections / enhancing the sky</li>
<li>Graduated Neutral-Density, for controlling sky brightness / enhancing the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>But I'm also aware that vignetting is a problem with filters on wide-angle lenses like this one. I've read some posts that go as far as to claim that it's ""not compatible with filters.""</p>

<p>What filters are worthwhile on this lens (especially for landscape photography)? What properties are more important as the focal length decreases?</p>
","<p>There are a couple posts here already on what filters are available and why you would use them, having been around the block a couple times on filters used for outdoor photography I'll try for an answer from a different angle: what I actually wind up using.</p>

<p><strong>Polarizing filters</strong>: Loved them at first, never use them now because they give an unnatural look to wide angle photographs that include skys (giant dark blue gradient in skys) and cause problems w/stitched photographs.  Still nice for tighter focal lengths or shots w/out sky, especially of foliage but overall I just never carry one.</p>

<p><strong>Split ND filters</strong>: Great idea in theory, kind of a pita to use in practice, <em>especially</em> if your exposure differential isn't a straight line (flat horizon).  I'm sure these were more useful back w/film where you had to get it in one shot, but now I'd rather take 2-3 shoots and create the gradient in post, not necessarily HDR but thats an option too.  Plus cheap split ND filters are resin or plastic (who wants plastic in front of a $1000 lens?) and just one SND filter doesn't cut it, you usually need 2 or 3, so to get 2 or 3 nice glass ones plus a holder... $$$.</p>

<p><strong>UV/Clear filters</strong>: never use these anymore because they're so prone to flare.  The only time I take one is if I'm shooting near something that might spray the lens (ocean).</p>

<p><strong>ND Filter</strong>:  This is the only filter I actually carry anymore because if you're already at ISO100 and stopped down to f16 or f22 and you still can't get a long enough exposure, this is the <em>only</em> way to do it.  Or if you want to shoot at a wide aperture in bright daylight this is the only way to reduce the amount of light.  I picked up a 10-stop ND filter and its awesome.  Another option is to get a Polarizing filter and just turn it till its polarization is 'off' and this'll give you 1.5-2 stops of ND.</p>

<p>My two cents.</p>

"How can one learn to shoot with both eyes open, and what are the advantages?","12376","","<p><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1514/greg"">Greg</a> made an intriguing comment <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8771/what-is-the-advantage-to-back-button-autofocus"">in this answer</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>One of the things we're supposed to do when we're shooting is keep both eyes open</strong>; That helps avoid fatigue from shooting for hours, but also lets us see what is going on around us. That is smart in case good action is happening to the side. It's also good because you might need to be aware of an unsafe condition unfolding while you're shooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've noticed that my eyes go a bit wonky after shooting with only one open, so this is an interesting idea. I'd never heard of it until now.</p>

<p>My main question is: how do you train yourself to do it?</p>

<p>Also: are there any other advantages? How prevalent is this among photographers?</p>
","<p>One of my professors years ago came from a photojournalism background and really drilled the 'both eyes open' ethos into our heads... and when I say drilled, I mean he would have us doing literal drills in order to get our minds around the idea and eliminate the 'bad habit' of closing one eye as soon as we put the viewfinder to our eye.</p>

<p>What he had us do started out pretty simple... Over the course of a quarter the progression went something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initially we just sat in the studio/classroom and practiced putting the camera to our eyes but NOT closing the opposing eye... I don't mean that we did that a few times... I think we spent 3 or 4 entire class sessions (the equivalent of nearly 3 or 4 hours) on the task. This was all about muscle memory, and in many ways it seemed very similar to the sorts of drills you'd see soldiers doing in boot camp as they learned to raise and aim their weapons with control and speed.</li>
<li>The next thing he had us do was close our viewfinder eye and do all our aiming with the eye that wasn't looking through the viewfinder. We must have spent a week on that alone, and it felt really strange at first, but it really trained us to not simply ignore the 'non-viewfinder' eye as soon as the camera is up in our face.</li>
<li>Then we practiced aiming our shots with the non-viewfinder eye with both eyes open. It's really interesting to feel yourself mentally shift focus from one eye to the other, and after a bit it became an almost instant and unconscious action... Ultimately, that was really his point in having us do this exercise (and all of them, really).</li>
<li>After that we spent weeks out on the quad taking pictures of people. He'd let us kinda be doing our own thing and then randomly he'd shout out to 'take a picture of the guy in the green hoodie' (or whatever the student he happened to be looking at was wearing). The instinct for most of us at first was to pull the camera away from our faces and look around for the person he was talking about... But over time we got good at swiveling around with our eyes up to the viewfinder and both eyes open searching for the photograph but never removing the camera from our eye... I'm sure it was quite a sight to see 25 photographers all simultaneously turn wherever they were and take a picture of a person. Later I found out that he actually recruited people to walk the quad during our classes, which I suppose makes sense in terms of not scaring random people walking to their classes. :-)</li>
<li>Finally, the thing he had us work on was putting it all together, that is getting to a point where we were composing shots <em>well</em> on the fly, never removing the camera from our eye, essentially using our 'free' eye to find the next shot while we were still working on the current one with our viewfinder eye. </li>
</ol>

<p>So that was the progression of drills he took us through, and it's a progression of drills that I still use with my own photography students (and I still drill myself... Mostly when I add a piece of new gear, a lens, or a new camera body). In terms of the advantages, certainly there's less fatigue in not having to shut one eye, but I think the real advantage is in having situational awareness and the muscle memory to compose  photographs happening around you very quickly and in a precise way. There are plenty of wedding photographs that I take 'on the fly' that I almost don't remember taking because I'm moving around the setting with both eyes so quickly, composing as I go, and capturing the moments...</p>

<p>As an aside, all of this is made easier with the control that back-button focus gives the photographer, and I 'never leave home without it.' :-)</p>

"Is ISO 200 still considered to be a bad choice, on digital cameras?","12344","","<p>In times of film photography there was a rule to either use ISO 100 film (or even great Velvia 50) which usually had considerably less grain noise than ISO 400 film. So 100 for outside or well lit subjects and 400 for indoor everyday photography. It was also considered that ISO 200 film was a bad choice because it provided no obvious advantage over 400. It had more noise than 100 and was slower than 400.</p>

<p>What's up with ISO 200 these days on a digital camera? Can same rules with 100 and 400 still be applied to DSLRs or have times changed considerably and nowadays even 200 gets used lots?</p>

<p>Disadvantagaes/advantages in terms of colours, contrast, noise and any other factors. What ISO settings do you usually use?</p>

<p>And I'm talking here about cropped sensor DSLRs (Canon and Nikon brethren).</p>
","<p>I think it's still generally true that one tends to either use lowest-possible ISO in bright lighting, or else higher-than-200 ISO settings in darker situations. But I wouldn't say I'd <em>avoid</em> ISO 200; it just often doesn't seem to be convenient. If I'm in the sun, there's usually no need for it, and if I'm indoors, I'd often rather get a little more depth of field or a faster shutter speed than worry about keeping ISO down. But if ISO 200 fit the exposure and aperture+time I want, I'd not think twice about using it.</p>

<p>One reason is that changing ISO is trivial now; I can choose ISO 200 for a particular shot with the press of a button and flick of a dial (or going into a menu), rather than <em>committing</em> to it until I change film. I can even let the camera automatically use it whenever it fits best.</p>

<p>Another other consideration is that modern digital SLR cameras, especially of recent vintage, have really very good high-ISO capabilities. The noise might not be attractive as film grain sometimes can be, but there's much, much less of it. So rather than going to ISO 400, one might not think twice about ISO 800, 1600, or beyond. I think you're right, though, that ISO 200 is still left in an awkward spot — if ISO 1600 looks great, why <em>not</em> use that instead?</p>

<p>On some cameras, though, there is a reason where ISO 200 is actually technically preferred over ISO 100. This is because on these cameras the <em><a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/3333/what-is-meant-by-the-native-iso-when-talking-about-dslrs/3342#3342"">base iso</a></em> of the sensor is 200, and going <em>below</em> that is actually worse, since it reduces dynamic range.</p>

<p>Or, one might want to use a highlight-preserving mode, if your camera offers it. Because digital sensors clip highlights in an ugly way rather than the graceful analog response of film, having blown-out bright areas is particularly bad. Some cameras offer a mode where they actually underexpose by one stop and the adjust upwards — you get more protection for highlights at the cost of increased shadow noise. And since each shot is really exposed one ISO step down, the bottom of the scale — ISO 100, on my camera — isn't an option. So, when I turn that on, ISO 200 becomes the lowest setting.</p>

<p>So, overall: I don't think there's a special problem with ISO 200, but I do think it falls in a less-used middle point. If you're using a camera which, for technical reasons, makes ISO 200 a good choice, don't be afraid of it. If you're using a small-sensor point &amp; shoot camera where ISO 200 is worse than 400, there may be times when it still makes a good compromise setting, but on cameras which exhibit less noise at higher levels, you'll probably just use those instead.</p>

","<p>PEF is Pentax's proprietary RAW format. DNG is the semi-standard owned by and promoted by Adobe.</p>

<p>In reality, there's no practical difference. They both hold the same information. It seems like there might be an advantage in having a standard format, but as a practical matter, RAW converter software needs to be updated with information for each camera anyway, and so DNG doesn't really add much. And pretty much all software that supports Pentax cameras via DNG can also read PEF files.</p>

I'm not looking for that. The Adobe feature seems to be a more subtle (and therefore more useful) tool for photo editing.</p>

However, I don't have any Adobe software, so I can't judge how closely this actually matches Adobe's effect.</p>

<p>Use Colors -> Components -> Decompose, decompose to Hue/Saturation/Value or Hue/Saturation/Luminance. Select the Saturation layer and use Curves to boost the saturation of the unsaturated parts of the image. (That is, the middle grays of the saturation layer. You may want to avoid boosting the saturation of the very darkest, least saturated parts of the saturation layer, because unexpected color casts can happen in areas that are very close to a colorless black, white, or gray.) Use Colors -> Components -> Recompose to apply the change to the original image.</p>

<p>That's pretty clumsy compared to using a slider, and it doesn't offer any smarts about skin tones, either. It may be possible for someone familiar with writing GIMP scripts (i.e., not me) to streamline and improve it, though.</p>

<p>Here's a photo I tried this method with. I tried to get about the same increase in saturation in the grass with both the ordinary saturation control and by using curves on a decomposed saturation layer. You can see that in both adjusted pictures, the grass is much more saturated, but that the simple saturation control also puts the reds in the fence and in the dogs' fur way over the top, where the curves method didn't.</p>

<p>Both are flash based, both support FAT filesystems — <strong>what's the difference</strong>?</p>
","<p><strong>Fundamentally they are the same thing in a different package but they work differently.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SD cards use their own protocol</strong> which was extended to go beyond 2 GB up to 32 GB with the introduction of SDHC (there were a few 4GB SD cards but not very compatible) and then to support up to 2 TB with the introduction of SDXC. The SD to SDHC transition if you remember was particularly painful as it took years for most other devices (Readers, Picture Frames, Card Readers, Laptops, etc) to catch-up.</p>

<p><strong>CF cards use the IDE protocol</strong> which can index large volumes by using pseudo head, track, sector coordinates. That they just kept working as capacities grew, although FAT32 support is used above 2 GB. That makes the protocol more stable and extensible although the next revision is CFast (Compact-Fast) which is based on the SATA protocol.</p>

<p><strong>The larger physical size of Compact Flash also gives them an edge in capacity and they still have a lead in terms of maximum speed as well.</strong> This has historically been significant but the gap is so narrow now that it is mostly a case of legacy.</p>

<p>In terms of camera grades, <strong>there are high-end models which each type of memory</strong>. The Pentax 645D Digital Medium-Format camera uses SDXC cards, Canon top-of-the-line models accept both CF and SD. This leaves only Nikon to exclusively use CF cards in their high-end models.</p>

<p>To see the marks for the C160 in the C310 I have to move the C310 further away by a full 3 cm.</p>

<p>This makes no sense to me, can someone clarify what ""field of view"" actually means?</p>
","<p><strong>Field-of-view is the angular extent shown through the lens.</strong> For fixed-lens cameras, and  all web-cams that I know of, the field-of-view is <em>normally</em> stated relative to sensor-size. This is very reasonable since the lens is fixed and cannot server on something else.</p>

<p>While this sounds like numbers could be compared, there several reasons why not:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Field-of-view can be measured vertically, horizontally and diagonally.</strong> Those numbers are not the same but some manufacturer only quote one of them and do not say which one. If you have to guess, it is <em>usually</em> the diagonal field-of-view.</li>
<li><strong>Field-of-view changes with focus</strong>. As a lens focuses, there is often change in its field-of-view, particularly when close-focusing. Most field-of-view numbers are stated with the lens focused at infinity. Actually, even the focal-length changes when away from infinity! Unfortunately, there is no formula for what happens to field-of-view as focus is changed because it depends on the particular optical design of the lens.</li>
<li><strong>Field-view varies with aspect-ratio.</strong> On cameras that shoot with different aspect-ratio, a reduced field-of-field is possibly shown. Only a few makers special field-of-view by aspect-ratio. A common example is switching between SD (4:3) and HD (16:9) video but the same thing applies with image-formats (3:2, 4:3, 1:1, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Digital processing reduces aspect-ratio</strong>. Certain features reduce the displayed aspect-ratio to save some boundary pixels used in their computation. This is always the case for electronic stabilization and most often used for multi-shot techniques like Multi-Frame Noise-Reduction, and HDR plus geometric corrections such as distortion correction, </li>

","<p>True DSLRs will always make noise by moving the mirror. This can be reduced by using mirror lock-up or in some modes of live view, but if you need to be really quiet you have to use either something mirrorless (like <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicGF1/"">Panasonic GF1</a>) or a <a href=""http://www.soundblimp.com/"">Sound Blimp</a>, which is basically a soundproof box around a DSLR (see <a href=""http://www.assignmentconstruct.com/index.php/assignmentconstruct/whatweuse/jacobsen_sound_blimp_for_cameras/"">video from John Harrington</a>).</p>

"Should I replace the Canon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens with a 40mm f/2.8 or 50mm f/1.4?","12189","","<p>So I'm about to buy my first DSLR (definitely a Canon, probably the 700D) and my original plan was to buy the one with the included 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens.</p>

<p>At the same time I was thinking about picking up the 50mm f/1.8 on account of the fact that it's cheap and I love taking photos of people with a shallow depth of field. </p>

<p>A couple of friends who are big into photography both suggested that the kit lenses aren't that good and produce blurry, distorted and drab imagery. They also both suggested that I should use the money saved by just getting the body to offset the cost of a decent prime lens.</p>

<p>At this point their views differed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One suggested that I should get the Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM. This works out at only £12 more expensive than the kit. They said it takes much better photos than the 50m f/1.8 for only a small amount more and it's very light.</p></li>
<li><p>Another suggested that I go directly to the Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 as it's a lens that I'll never ever need to replace. This works out at £150 more expensive than the kit, although I can take (very small) comfort in the fact that I'm saving £80 by not buying the f/1.8 as a stepping stone to the f/1.4.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both also suggested that once I'd had some lessons, learnt how to use the camera and <em>absolutely must</em> have a zoom lens, then I save up and look to buy something decent at that point in time, rather than use the kit lens.</p>

<p>Should I drop the kit lens and pick up a decent prime? Will I be missing out on some types of photography without the kit lens? Or should I start off with the kit and nifty-fifty and upgrade each component over time? </p>

<h2>My opinion</h2>

<p>The kit lenses of today are generally not that bad, especially for the almost zero cost that they add to the body price in most cases. Even though they are not that bad as far as image quality, they do have limiting maximum apertures(f/3.5-f/4.0 to f/5.6 typically) though so that is the main reason picking up a inexpensive f/1.8 lens is usually recommended. Having that huge aperture opens up possibilities that you simply can't have with a f/4 lens. It is also literally <em>eye opening</em> when comparing it to a point and shoot camera, since f/1.8 is nearly unheard of in a point and shoot camera.</p>

<p>What should you do? I would buy the kit anyways due to the very small additional cost, use it for a few months, then when <em>you</em> know what is limiting your progress in the art, <em>you</em> will know what to buy! If you really have the extra cash, the 50mm f/1.8 or f/1.4 will be great to own at the same time as a kit 18-55mm zoom lens. Many, many people go this route.</p>

<p>While sitting in a room, there was a ray of light coming in through a small opening in the window. I tried my best, to capture the light ray, against the contrasting darkness in the room, but I failed. I have tried to take such a picture outside too, in woods, where light rays were coming in through think growth of trees, but the capture was not at all what I have seen in pictures of similar situations.</p>

<p>Here is a picture I randomly picked from Flickr to clarify what I was trying to capture.

<p>My question is, what is the appropriate setting on the camera OR simply put, how can I take such pictures (of light rays) in open areas and/or closed spaces, like a room.</p>
","<p>Well, first of all it's not possible at all to photograph the ray of light itself. You can only photograph the effect that the ray has on other things.</p>

<p>To catch how the ray shines through the air, you need something in the air to reflect the ray, like dust or mist.</p>

<p>Once the effect of the ray is visible in the air, you can easily photograph it. It will be more visible if the background is dark, so you may need to adjust the exposure, or use manual settings so that the camera doesn't expose to make the background light.</p>

"What is a zone plate?","12167","","<p>I was looking into alternative methods of photography and I happened upon something called a 'zone plate.'</p>

<p>Three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is a zone plate? </li>
<li>How does it work?</li>
<li>What can I do with it?</li>
</ol>
","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A zone plate is a way of focusing light, like a lens, but using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_diffraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fresnel diffraction</a> instead of refraction. This is cool from a theoretical point of view, because it <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arago_spot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">demonstrates the wave nature of light</a>. And it's cool from a photography point of view, because the images produced have a unique glow, with an impressionistic almost-painted look. If you're attracted to a certain lo-fi ""old-camera"" aesthetic, using a zone plate is a way to get it authentically, rather than faking it in post-processing.</p>

<h2>Construction and Principles</h2>

<p>The plate, which is a small piece of glass, plastic, or something else relatively transparent, is inscribed with concentric opaque circles. In order to create a focused image, these are placed so that the interference creates <a href=""http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-016/_2398.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zones</a> of ""constructive"" interference, forming a focused image. The D.I.Y zone plate web page <a href=""http://www.whizkidtech.redprince.net/zoneplate/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Whiz Kid Technomagic Zone Plate Designer</a> explains the math and pratical physics behind the choice of size and spacing quite nicely. And the Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_plate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article on zone plates</a> has some graphics, one of which I'm borrowing here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zone_plate.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Zone_plate.svg/500px-Zone_plate.svg.png""></a><br/><sub>Graphic by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Brighterorange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tom Murphy VII</a>, licensed CC-BY-SA</sub></p>

<p>(This same sort of image is also used, for unrelated reasons, and with finer circles than the one above, to produce moiré patterns for testing display quality, or for <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1/what-is-the-best-way-to-micro-adjust-a-lens/9984#9984"">tuning autofocus</a>.)</p>

<h2>Versus Pinhole Lens</h2>

<p>A zone plate is often compared to a pinhole lens, but there are important differences.</p>

<p>First, it <em>does</em> have a depth of field and therefore can be focused, although usually the DoF is rather large (like using a 35mm lens stopped down to <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20101117203834/http://assets.lensbaby.com/newsletter_archive/2009-05-28/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">f/22 or so</a>). Second, the amount of light let through is significantly greater. For example, Lensbaby's (out of production, as of 2015) <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150316031936/http://lensbaby.com/optics-kit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pinhole/Zone Plate optic</a> provides an f/177-equivalent pinhole, and in zone plate mode is something like f/19 — 6½ stops faster.</p>

<p>This means that with a modern SLR, you can, with care, shoot hand-held. And, although it'll be dark, you can even compose through the viewfinder. (On my Pentax K-7, the metering even works accurately.)</p>

<h2>The Look</h2>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, the zone plate look is quite distinctive. Point sources of light will actually show the concentric-circle pattern of the zone plate in a very dramatic way. And as with <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2706/"">bokeh in a lens</a>, this affects the image even in non-highlight areas — 
areas of bright light have a, well, <em>diffused</em> glow around them. Personally, I don't care for the ""archery target"" effect of highlights and try to avoid them, but I like the soft look which suffuses the image if point sources are avoided:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VXQu.jpg"" alt=""zone plate portrait""><br/><sub>Photo by me, licensed CC-BY-SA 3.0 at this resolution.</sub></p>

<p>There's <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/zoneplates/pool/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">examples on Flickr</a>, and since Lensbaby sold a zone plate optic, they also provided a gallery of samples which illustrated the effect. That's offline now, but a few images are still in on the site, including one which shows the <a href=""http://lensbaby.com/sites/default/files/galleryphoto/753.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">concentric-circle light</a> effect, and a nice <a href=""http://lensbaby.com/sites/default/files/galleryphoto/678.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">portraits</a>. I also think it works very well on flowers (but Lensbaby's sample for that has vanished).</p>

<h2>Some Zone Plate Options</h2>

<p>On the Lensbaby product: I'm not sure I'd spend $100 (or more) for a <a href=""http://store.lensbaby.com/categories/Lens-Bodies/?sort=priceasc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lens body</a> plus $40 for the pinhole/zone plate optic (no longer made but as of 2015 easily found used) <em>just</em> for this, but if you already have a Lensbaby, or are thinking of getting one for the other optics, and are interested in this kind of photography, I think it's well worthwhile. Since moving the focus plane and area of sharpness isn't really a consideration here, the <a href=""http://lensbaby.com/lenses-scout.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scout</a> lens body might be the best choice.</p>

<p>Pinhole Resource also offers <a href=""http://www.pinholeresource.com/shop/shop?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=15&amp;vmcchk=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zone plate body caps</a>; at around $65 for the dSLR versions, these are considerably cheaper than the Lensbaby combo (but of course more expensive if you're considering a whole Lensbaby kit anyway). I haven't used these, so I can't meaningfully compare them in practice. I notice that they're f/45 — two and a half stops slower than the Lensbaby. That would probably compromise the ability to compose through the viewfinder, and I wouldn't be surprised if metering is out of the question. And of course it means any portrait subjects need to sit extra-still, perhaps pretending they're getting their 19th-century tintype taken.</p>

<p>And, there's the <a href=""http://www.whizkidtech.redprince.net/zoneplate/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">D.I.Y. zone plate page</a> I mentioned above. This suggests an older process using B&amp;W film to make precise lines, or else simply printing on a transparency with a laser printer. This is probably less precise than the machine-made more-expensive zone plates, which would result in a loss of overall resolving power — but if you're going this approach, resolving power probably isn't your top concern anyway, and as the site notes, you'll have the flexibility to tune your zone plates to different wavelengths of light or to different focal lengths and aperture sizes.</p>

","<h1>You're probably better off with native-mount lenses</h1>

<p>For the most part, no, you can't mix'n'match lenses from different brands of cameras, because they'll usually use different mount systems. The mount system specifies how the lens and camera body physically link, and may also specify electronic communication between the lens and camera.  If the lens and camera are not in the same mount system, you cannot use the lens directly on the camera without some kind of adapting--and most such adapting  may only take care of the physical link, not the electronic one.  The only different-brands same-mount situations that may arise are Olympus/Panasonic both making gear in the four-thirds dSLR and micro four-thirds mirrorless mounts, and Sony's A-mount being the same as Minolta's AF mount. Or 3rd-party lens makers like Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, Zeiss, Cosina Voigtl&auml;nder, Vivitar, Samyang, etc. making lenses for multiple camera mounts.</p>

<h1>This isn't Cheap and Easy</h1>

<p>You often see people talking about how much cheaper it is to adapt older glass.  Well, if all you want to use are 50mm lenses, maybe so.  But the days of bargains in vintage glass pretty much disappeared when dSLRS began to do HD video and film students around the globe wanted cheap manual focus lenses of high quality (e.g., Zeiss) for their projects.  And given crop factors, wide and fast are going to cost you, no matter the mount.  If the lens isn't a 50mm f/2 or f/1.8 prime and it's supercheap, it'll probably be one that's tough to adapt to a dSLR mount, or has something wrong with it.  And if you do save money, trust us when we tell you, you'll be paying that savings back in inconvenience. You really really want to ask yourself if a current autofocus native-mount lens might not be a better use for your cash.</p>

<p>If, however, you're into vintage collecting, or you just want to see if you can do it, and you've got a good sense of how to pick up vintage gear in good condition (not fungus eaten), and like doing delicate glass &amp; metal disassembly/repair/reassembly work or know of an affordable <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/15613/what-is-cla-service"">CLA</a> guy, maybe this will be rewarding enough to pursue.  Here are the main factors to consider:</p>

<h1>Mount Type</h1>

<p>Brand is not enough to identify a lens mount. A lot of camera companies made (and make) a variety of cameras and lenses (e.g., see <a href=""http://www.canon.com/c-museum/en/lens-series.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Canon Camera Museum website's Lens Hall</a>). A lot of companies have done not just SLR lenses, but also rangefinder or possibly even medium format lenses as well.  And for dSLR mounts, some companies make completely different (and incompatible) manual focus, autofocus, and/or digital mounts. Or make both mirrorless and dSLR/dSLT systems (e.g. Canon EOS vs. EOS-M, Sony A-mount vs. E-mount, etc.). In addition 3rd-party brands, such as Vivitar, also made lenses for multiple brands. Be sure that you identify the specific mounts for X and Y. </p>

<p>See: <a href=""http://rick_oleson.tripod.com/index-99.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rick_oleson.tripod.com/index-99.html</a> for a good pictorial guide on identifying common SLR lens mounts.</p>

<p>Typically, <em>unless you're happy to put up with severe vignetting,</em> you can never adapt from a smaller system to a larger one, because the image circle the lens is designed to project is too small to cover the sensor. That is, 135 format (aka 35mm or ""full-frame"") lenses can't be adapted to medium format cameras; but medium format lenses can be adapted for 35mm/full-frame cameras.  35mm cine lenses can't be adapted to 135 format.  Some micro 4/3 users are happy to slap C-mount 1"" video lenses on their 4/3"" format cameras, because they can get f/0.95 lenses for cheap that way.  But this is more of an exception than a rule. With 35mm format lenses, the other rule to remember is that you can adapt SLR lenses to rangefinders, but not rangefinders to SLRs (or mirrorless to dSLRs). This is because of registration distance.</p>

<h1>Registration Distance</h1>

<p>(or, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flange_focal_distance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as Wikipedia puts it, ""Flange Focal Distance""</a>) is simply the mount depth.  It's how far you hold the lens away from the image plane.  Each mount system is designed with a specific distance, and lenses cannot achieve focus to infinity without being held at this specific distance.  If the lens is held closer, its close focusing is compromised and it may focus past infinity.  If the lens is held farther away, its close focusing is enhanced, but it cannot focus to infinity (think: macro extension tubes).  </p>

<p>Ideally, you want to maintain the full focus range of the lens by adapting from a deeper mount to a shallower one with a simple ring adapter that makes up the difference in distances and provides a physical linkage for differing bayonet flanges and/or screw threads. You can look up the registration distance for a specific mount on the Wikipedia page linked to above.  </p>

<p>Your worst bet with dSLRs is Nikon, because Nikon's registration distance is the second largest, (only Leica R is larger). To use most film SLR lenses, you'll need glass element adapters or lens mount replacement kits (see below).</p>

<p>With dSLRS, your best bets are Canon EOS and Olympus or Panasonic four-thirds camera mounts, which can use simple rings to adapt Nikon-F, Leica-R, Contax/Yashica, Olympus OM, Pentax K, and M42 lenses. (Actually, theoretically, four-thirds can adapt far more, but being a less popular mount system, these are the only six mounts you'll easily find adapter rings for).</p>

<p>But the best bet of all are mirrorless cameras, because they have very shallow registration distances. Mirrorless mounts can adapt all dSLR mount lenses, as well as most rangefinder lenses (however, sensor stack thickness may become an issue).</p>

<p>But a simple ring adapter with infinity focus isn't possible if X's registration distance is shallower than Y's. And may not be possible even if X <em>is</em> deeper than Y, because the depth difference has to be thick enough that a ring can be reliably machined to hold up. </p>

<p>If you try to adapt a shallower mount lens to a deeper mount body with a simple ring, this often means the lens can't focus past 10'. If you're <em>not</em> doing macro or close portrait photography with this lens and want to focus past that point, then you're going to have to do one of two things: modify the lens's (or camera's) mount, or use an adapter with a glass element in it to achieve focus to infinity.</p>

<h2>Modifying Mounts</h2>

<p>This is actually something of a sport among vintage lens collectors. Many vintage lens enthusiasts have spanner wrenches and machine shops at their disposal and think nothing of replacing a lens's mount with a modified adapter ring and experimenting with shims to get the proper registration distance.  However, for those not willing to go quite that far, there are the <a href=""http://www.leitax.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leitax lens mount replacement kits</a> for specific lens combinations that are more popular among enthusiasts (e.g., Leica-R and Zeiss C/Y lenses to Nikon, etc.) But only a small set of X/Y combinations are liable to be found there because of this.</p>

<h2>Adapters with Glass Elements</h2>

<p>The other way around the registration distance issue is to use an adapter with a glass element to act like a short teleconverter.  The negatives to this are that the glass acts like a short teleconverter: your focal length increases, your maximum aperture decreases, and if you get a cheap one, you'll add softness to the image.  That doesn't mean these aren't usable.  There are a lot of happy people who use adapters with glass elements for older lenses, but these are generally folks who are willing to compromise on image quality for cost. Depending on the lens you want to adapt (say, a cheap 50mm f/2 lens vs. a US$8300 Leica-M Noctilux 50mm f/1.0), this may or may not be worth your time.</p>

<h1>Other Caveats (or Registration Distance Ain't Everything)</h1>

<p>And there are, of course, a lot of other possible gotchas.</p>

<h2>Adapter Accuracy</h2>

<p>Remember that an adapter ring is a mechanical thing. Making one perfectly flat, a specific thickness, etc. are all going to rely heavily on the manufacturing process. These things vary. Some adapter rings have a looser fit than others. The quality you get from an adapted lens can vary depending on the precision of the adapter you're using, and even the best of them may still have image quality compromises. See Roger Cicala's  lensrentals.com blog entry: <a href=""http://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2013/09/there-is-no-free-lunch-episode-763-lens-adapters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""There Is No Free Lunch, Episode 763: Lens Adapters""</a>.</p>

<h2>Mount Throat</h2>

<p>While registration distance is important, it's not the only factor--particularly if you're adapting to Sony A-mount (once called the Alpha mount) dSLTs. While the Sony dSLTs have the same registration distance as Canon's EOS mount, they cannot use those same six mounts that Canon EOS dSLRs can, because the mount throat is smaller than Canon's, forcing the lenses to be held farther away. The only simple ring adapters for Sony A-mount you'll find are for Leica-R and M42 (M42 is much smaller in diameter than the bayonet-type SLR mounts).</p>

<h2>Mirror Clearance</h2>

<p>Not all dSLRs have the same mirror clearance as their film counterparts. A lot of eager-beaver adapters for the Canon full-frame prosumer bodies discovered that some Contax/Yashica and Leica-R lenses <a href=""http://www.pebbleplace.com/Personal/Contax_db.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have back elements that collide with the mirror on a 5D</a> (all marks) or 6D body while being clear of the mirror on a crop-body or 1-series pro body.  You can get around this by grinding down or ""shaving"" the mirror, but it's easy to damage a body and you'll definitely reduce its resale value by doing so--particularly if you grind down far enough for it to be seen in the viewfinder. </p>

<p>Obviously, if you're shooting mirrorless, this doesn't apply to you. Sensor stack thickness, however, does.</p>

<h2>Sensor Stack Thickness</h2>

<p>Roger Cicala is the one who figured this puzzler out. Certain lenses known to be great performers on film and that test as top performers (e.g., Leica-M rangefinder lenses), when adapted onto mirrorless camera bodies were showing image quality problems--particularly wide angle Leica rangefinder glass on the Sony A7 cameras. Also new mirrorless lenses that tested great on mirrorless cameras didn't test so well on his optical test bench.  He did experimentation and research into the issue, and wrote a three-part series on the sensor stack issue: <a href=""http://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2014/06/the-glass-in-the-path-sensor-stacks-and-adapted-lenses"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""The Glass in the Path: Sensor Stacks and Adapted Lenses""</a>, <a href=""http://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2014/06/sensor-stack-thickness-when-does-it-matter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Sensor Stack Thickness: When Does It Matter?""</a> and <a href=""http://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2014/07/sensor-stack-thickness-part-iii-the-summary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Sensor Stack Thickness Part III: The Summary""</a> </p>

<p>In essence, the thickness of the glass protecting the sensor, in proportion to how far the lens's exit pupil is from the sensor, has an effect on optical performance. He also found that his test bench didn't have anything like a sensor stack in the optical path, and that adding one made the results of the test bench more accurate. Some mirrorless cameras (most notably micro four-thirds) have thicker stacks than you'd expect, and rangefinder lenses have much shorter entrance pupil differences, and particularly with faster lenses, there can be a notable performance drop off. </p>

<h2>Aperture Rings</h2>

<p>If you want to adapt to another mount, because of the lack of electronic communication (unless, say, you're using a Metabones autofocus adapter), you lose aperture control from the camera. Regaining it is extraordinarily problematic if the lens you're adapting doesn't have an aperture ring (e.g., Canon EOS, micro four-thirds, Minolta AF, or Nikon G lenses). There are ways around this (with a Canon EOS lens, for example, you can mount it on a Canon body, adjust the aperture, hold down the DoF preview button, and then unmount and remount it on the adapted body, and it will retain its aperture setting), or use an adapter with a built-in iris, but they tend to be less than optimal.</p>

<p>Upshot: you really want an aperture ring on the lens you're trying to adapt.</p>

<h2>Stop-Down Metering</h2>

<p>Because of the lack of aperture control, you may lose accurate metering. Entry level Nikon bodies cannot accurately meter with non-CPU lenses. And if your camera body does perform stop-down metering, then the lens actually has to be stopped down when getting the metering.  This may require the adapter to have a pin in it that holds down a lever to stop the lens down to the aperture set with the lens ring (e.g., some Olympus OM adapter rings do this; some don't). And no matter what happens, when you stop the lens down, the view in the viewfinder gets darker. You may need to use liveview to compose.</p>

<h2>Manual Focusing Aids</h2>

<p>Most modern digital system cameras are designed with autofocus in mind, and this extends to the viewfinder.  If you are using a dSLR with an optical viewfinder, the focusing aids that made manual focus lenses fine for use on manual film SLRs are no longer there. Split circles and prism collars can be added, but can darken or go black in the viewfinder with slower (f/5.6) lenses. If you have an entry-level dSLR or one with an LCD overlay in the viewfinder, replacing the focusing screen is problematic at best.  Your best bet may be to use liveview and features such as focus peaking or magnification, but this also makes using a manual adapted lens far less spontaneous than with a modern autofocusing native mount lens.  Some adapter rings are chipped to provide AF confirmation, but user reports are varied on the efficacy of this.</p>

<h2>Autofocus</h2>

<p>Even if you get an autofocus-capable adapter that can translate and communicate the autofocus and aperture information between the lens and the camera, chances are good that the autofocus performance could be compromised (e.g., Metabones Sony A to Sony E mount adapter; Conurus Contax N to EOS adapter).</p>

<h2>EXIF</h2>

<p>Not only do you lose aperture control and wide-open metering, but you also lose lens EXIF information such as your aperture setting or the lens's name and focal length. Some of this information can be supplied to the camera body with a chipped adapter ring, but may require some manual setting of the aperture in each and every shot. </p>

<h2>X=Y Special Cases</h2>

<p>Your two best bets for using older vintage glass in the same brand directly on a current digital mount are Nikon F and Pentax K.  Even the older manual focus lenses, albeit with a few restrictions, still work on those cameras.  </p>

<p>Canon EOS and Minolta AF (aka Sony A-mount) OEM lenses from the mid-80s forward are compatible with current dSLR bodies (although 3rd party lenses may need to be rechipped); however manual focus Canon FD/FL and Minolta MD/MC have shallower mounts than EOS and Sony A, respectively. </p>

<p>Olympus completely changed its mount system between film cameras and digital ones, so OM mount lenses require an adapter, either for four-thirds dSLRs or micro four-thirds mirrorless.</p>

"How does one create the Dave Hill effect for portraits/action shots?","12131","","<p>Inspired by the question <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/4416/how-do-i-achieve-this-post-process-effect"">here</a> by <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1273/sebastien-b"">sebastian.b</a>, and the response to the subsequent <a href=""https://photo.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/414/post-processing-tips-questions-allowed"">meta question</a>. I would like to ask how to achieve a specific photo effect.</p>

<p>There may be more photographers that pull this off, but I know of two specific ones. The first is the wonderful photographer, <a href=""http://www.davehillphoto.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dave Hill</a>. I know that he does lots of post processing, and his talent goes beyond a short list of tips that I can learn from a website, but I think there is something that I can hope to understand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the Dave Hill effect? I have heard people talk about it, but what is it actually and how does one achieve it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On his webpage, the ""Nerd ad"", ""Allen Robinson"", and ""Jon Heder"" shots give the subjects a specific skin tone/saturation. In general, his portrait shots are amazing. The detail and texture mystifies me. How can I pull this eerie feeling off?</p>

<p>Now the second photographer is <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/30507491@N03/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skylove</a> from flikr. His shots are also extremely impressive. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some ideas I have had that might contribute to this are HDR or possibly just phenomenal lighting setups. I have watched the videos on Dave Hill's website, but they just make me think more-so that he sold his soul to Mephistopheles. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any suggestions on how to achieve these results, or even some direction to go in this direction. </p>

<p>Thanks so much! </p>
","<h2>It's all about the lighting!</h2>

<hr>

<p>Most people seem to think it's all done in 'shop but a lot of work goes into the actual setup. Many of the supposed <strong>""Dave Hill look""</strong> imitations have just used HDR style tonemapping, and the results are <em>nothing like the work of Dave Hill</em>. Compare this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=dave%20hill%20look&amp;w=all"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=dave%20hill%20look&amp;w=all</a></p>

<p>with this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.davehillphoto.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.davehillphoto.com/</a></p>

<p>No similarity at all! Yes there is a lot of post production in Dave's work, but you need to get close with the lighting in order to get the same look. Here is an example, showing what is possible with <strong>lighting alone</strong>. The first image is straight out of camera:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aaron/aaron_straight_out_of_camera.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aaron/aaron_straight_out_of_camera.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aaron/aaron_final.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aaron/aaron_final.jpg</a></p>

<p>...the second image is the final image after Photoshop, mostly saturation, contrast and a little high pass filter in an overlay blending layer. I should have pointed out I didn't set out to get the <em>Dave Hill look</em>, I just wanted to play around and see what worked with the subject (the singer in a Ska band). I could have done more in post to get slightly closer to Dave's images.</p>

<p>The key to the look is <strong>sculpted light</strong>. This means directing large lightsources at oblique angles to the subject. I used two square softboxes right up close and a bare hotshoe strobe for the hair light. Here's how the lights were placed:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aaron/lighting_diagram.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aaron/lighting_diagram.png</a></p>

<p>The softboxes were brought in really close to maximise the <strong>softness</strong> of the light, and angled toward the camera to increase the sculpting effect and falloff nicely across the face. Two ""gobos"" were used to stop flare interfering with the picture (the black lines in the diagram). This is  <em>absolutely essential</em> when angling the strobes toward the camera! The hairlight at the back was bare (i.e. no modifier) to really penetrate Aaron's hair and make it glow. As less power is required for an unmodified light, I substituted a hotshoe flash for the big monolight.</p>

<p>You can replicate this look on the cheap with a couple of hotshoe flashes but softboxes are important. Something like an <a href=""http://www.lastolite.com/umbrellabox.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">umbrellabox</a> is a good option if you're using small battery flashes. You just don't get the same effect with umbrellas as they spill too much light out the sides, and are in general harder to fine tune as you don't get a crisp edge to the light. The curved profile of the umbrella also makes it hard to get close. Getting close basically makes your softboxes bigger. Dave would have used huge octoboxes further away to give the model more space but he gets paid more than I do ;)</p>

<p>You can actually see Dave's setups in his behind the scenes videos (which I've just noticed you mentioned in your question!). And yup there are some big octoboxes! <a href=""http://www.davehillphoto.com/bts/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.davehillphoto.com/bts/</a></p>

<p>Here's another example of the same look in a group shot I did for the band Asking Alexandria. This one required a bit more post production (as lighting groups is much harder) so I'll take it step by step to show you what sort of post production you can do to push the look to its limits. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa_straight_out_of_camera.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa_straight_out_of_camera.jpg</a></p>

<p>As before, lighting is still very important. I used a very similar setup to the previous example but with the softboxes much more symmetrical. The models stood in a triangle pattern so the light hit everybody. The hairlight is also much higher this time as we're lighting the top of the head, not shining <strong>through</strong> anyone's hair (which would have required three hairlights in this example). You can see the lightstand for the hair light in the straight out of camera shot, behind the guy on the left.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa1.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa1.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here's the image after Raw conversion in Adobe Camera Raw, where I added a little of the clarity slider, brought up the black point and used a lot of the fill light slider. I wasn't going for any specific look, just to get an image with detail and a good tonal range to work with. The background clutter has been removed by a manual selection. Also note I've made the image taller by adding more black. I planned to do this so I shot the original very tightly cropped to make the most of my megapixels (I didn't do this with Aaron as some of the shots we took involved a lot of movement).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa2.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa2.jpg</a> </p>

<p>Here I've faded a little of the ground into the image with a gradient mask in order to <strong>ground</strong> the models and make them look a little less like they're floating in space!</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa3.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa3.jpg</a></p>

<p>Next I went mental with the Photomatix tonemapping plug-in! With any sort of HDR work, taste and subtlety is important. I find the easiest way to achieve this is to push it as far as I can and then fade it into the original at a very low opacity to retain some realism.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa4.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa4.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here, it is reduced in opacity to 30%. I actually lowered it to 15% in the final version, as I just wanted to show the effect in bringing out the details in the legs and shoes that was lost due to the fact I concentrated on lighting the faces (and didn't have any striplights to hand). It's also done a nice job with the hair.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa5.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa5.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now here's pièce de résistance of the post processing. I've duplicated the original applied a high pass filter (which removes small details such as noise) and leaves large scale tone changes. The layer is blended back in at 30% with the blending mode set to <strong>overlay</strong>. This is very important, as it sort of amplifies the high pass by lightening the lights and darkening the darks. It's starting to look how I want it now.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa6.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/aa/pp/aa6.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here's the final image after some fiddling; dodging and burning here and there, and some minor colour correction (I moved the jeans away from cyan and desaturated for a more pleasing look). Desaturated skin tones makes this lighting technique look better in almost all cases. Finally, the image is resized and sharpening applied, leaving an image which I think captures the look you are going for based on the examples posted.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that you need a <strong>dark place</strong> in order to pull this off otherwise you lose control over the light and you will have difficulties getting the deep shadows required for maximum contrast. The first image of Aaron was shot in a black walled studio, but if you don't have access to a studio you can get the same effect in any large space. The size is important as the light that gets reflected back from other objects falls off with the squre of the distance (double the space, 4x less light bouncing off walls), up to the point where it is totally overpowered by the subject and you get a nice black background. If you're looking for a large space, the great outdoors comes in very handy!</p>

"Is it worth buying a 5D Mark I or an EOS 1Ds II today?","12127","","<p>I've been taking photographs for a while, and have started to think about moving to full-frame. I'm on a <em>very</em> limited budget, but I currently have a good macro lens and am quite willing to buy something like a EF 50mm f/1.8 to start off with. I could <em>possibly</em> stretch my budget as far as a 70-200 f/4 L or 24-105 f/4 L.</p>

<p>Primarily, I'm interested in taking photos of small wildlife like reptiles, amphibians and insects, but I have a healthy interest in landscapes, birds and street photography. </p>

<p>I currently have an EOS 30D, and I love the way the camera handles, especially with the dual control dials. For this reason, I think shooting with a Rebel would be a significant step down. </p>

<p>However, I have seen 5Ds and occasionally 1Ds Mark IIs on ebay for roughly the same price as an EOS 650D. I'm sure these cameras have better IQ than my 30D, since they are pro-level bodies from around the same time, and full-frame besides. The question is, are these cameras now so old that the image quality from them is a substantial step down from current Rebels? </p>

<p>I realise I'll be giving up continuous shooting speed and some amount of low-light performance, and that I'd also need to get an external flash, but besides these, are there any substantial caveats I need to be aware of before I go ahead and take the plunge?</p>
","<p>I have a 1Ds mkII and an original 5D. The fact I still have them is mainly due to the fact that they're worth a lot more to me that I would get from selling them. In other words I think they're probably undervalued on the second hand market.</p>

<p>The main reason I say this is that the look you get from a full frame sensor is in many ways unobtainable with a smaller sensor. I'm not just talking about noise / dynamic range. Dynamic range in good light is pretty much the same as newer bodies, noise is generally better with the older full frames but extreme low light shooting will be better on the current rebels as the analogue ISO amplification goes up to 12,800 whereas the 5D/1DsII only go up to ISO 1,600.</p>

<p>Instead I'm talking about depth of field, and sharpness. A really sharp image with shallow depth of field really makes the subject pop. You can't get the same effect on a crop as there simply aren't any fast wide lenses available, a 24 f/1.4 lens on full frame is equivalent to a 15mm f/0.9 lens on APS-C, the closest you can get is a 14mm f/2.8, which is over three stops slower (for about the same price). A cheap 50mm f/1.8 is equivalent to a 31 f/1.1!</p>

<p>The advantage in subject separation remains until 135 (well into telephoto) where you can match it with a crop, albeit with a much more expensive lens (85mm f/1.2L as compared to 135mm f/2.0L). Sharpness is better as you're not enlarging the image as much when you view a full frame photograph at a certain size compared to APS-C.</p>

<p>Having said that these advantages go away as soon as you start cropping your full frame images. If you are predominately chasing small lizards you may well find little advantage with a full frame camera.</p>

<p>With the 1Ds you also gain a top of the range 45 point AF system and weather sealing, but this comes with increased weight, confusing menu controls (you have to hold down different buttons while using the control wheels to change settings or navigate photos).</p>

<p>You have to consider what you're giving up, live view is certainty very useful for certain types of shooting. Rear LCD screens have improved a lot especially compared to the 1DsII, which has a tiny screen with very poor contrast. Speed of shooting and writing to memory cards in particular has improved a lot.</p>

<p>My gut feeling is this wont matter as you're used to not having these things with the 30D -- you will feel very at home with the 5D as it shares almost exactly the same control layout. You'll have to learn the 1Ds controls but it will reward you with much better AF.</p>

"Should I shoot underexposed photos?","12116","","<p>Someone more experienced than me said that he always shoots so that his photos are underexposed (darker) and I should too. The reasoning being that you can always increase the exposure in postproduction, but you can never get the details back from overexposed parts of the photo.</p>

<p>But if I think about it I think that you lose the dynamic range with this technique.
So I have three questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>What should I do?</i> Should I do it that way, or does it depend on the circumstances (like if I have enough time to test for proper exposure, etc.). Or should I rather try to learn to ""guess"" the right settings (I will fail a lot but also learn a lot)?</li>
  <li><i>What do you do?</i> How do you aproach a shoot?</li>
  <li><i>How does underexposing affect dynamic range of photos?</i> Does it effectively reduce contrast?</li>
</ol>
","<p>With underexposure, a third of a stop won't hurt you much.  Two-thirds is not great, but not that bad.  A whole stop means you're doubling your noise.  Two stops and you're quadrupling it.  So underexposure is by no means ""free"", but there are grades of it.</p>

<p>With overexposure, any amount will start to clip.  Whether that is very detrimental will depend on the subject matter, but it's generally more damaging to your image than the noise of underexposure.</p>

<p>Now to your questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>What should I do? Should I do it that way, or does it depend on the circumstances (like if I have enough time to test for proper exposure, etc.). Or should I rather try to learn to ""guess"" the right settings (I will fail a lot but also learn a lot)?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>No, don't underexpose.  Aim to expose correctly.  If you are not sure if you've exposed correctly, then it's better to underexpose a little than overexpose a little, that is true, though it still won't get results as good as exposing correctly. If you have the opportunity to try again if you make a mistake, it's better to aim for a correct exposure and try again later if you don't get it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>What do you do? How do you aproach a shoot?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I try to get it spot on.  I check the display on the LCD, and might check the RGB histogram, and if I've under- or over- exposed then I take another one.  Of course this is not a luxury you have if you're doing photojournalism or anything like that, where you can't re-try the shot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>How does underexposing affect dynamic range of photos? Does it effectively reduce contrast?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Underexposing reduces dynamic range by removing some range in the darkest areas, such as shadows.  So underexposing by one stop reduces your dynamic range by one stop (ie, by half).  The noise floor raises, so the loss in dynamic range is expressed as an increase in noise in the darkest parts of the image, obscuring some of the range that otherwise would have shown dark shadow detail.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that it reduces ""contrast"" as such.  It does reduce the dynamic range - that is, the relative distance between the darkest and lightest detail you can reproduce without it being obscured by noise.  But I wouldn't describe that as primarily an effect on contrast - depending how you use the word ""contrast"".</p>

<p>(2) Without having got my brain fully around the triple vanishing point method described in a reference, I would think that for vanishing points to be relevant you would need to deal with lines which were parallel in reality but rendered apparently not so by perspective OR perhaps wit lines whose actual interposing angle was known and which were rendered at another apparent angle in the image. However, in the example photo given, the actual angle between the two walls on either side of the island seems to be arbitrary and unknown (except to their builders) and that changing this angle changes the answer you would get.

<ul>
<li>fx = (imageWidth) / (2 * tan(alphaX) ) </li>

<p>Where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fx = focal length<br>
  imagewidth = sensor width<br>
   alphaX = HALF angle of view</p>

<p>HALF the angle of view = alpha has tan(alpha) = Y/X = height/distance.<br>
 The identical tan is produced by half the image height on the sensor / focal length.<br>
  So<br>
  (sensor_height/2) / focal_length = height/distance = tan (alpha)<br>

 (IW/2) / fx = tan_alpha<br>

"At how many megapixels should I render my image for a quality A1 print?","12044","","<p>I'm rendering an image for an exhibition (the image is composed of multiple digital images, so I have control over the detail of the final render), but I'm getting conflicting opinions on how many megapixels I should use for printing at A1 format (594 x 841mm. or 23.39 × 33.11 inches).</p>

<p>Some say that approx. 5 megapixels is enough (because you'll stand further away from a large print), others say that I'll need a massive amount of megapixels for that size (12+), to render the fine detail.</p>

<p>Is there anyone with experience in exhibiting prints of this size? What do you recommend, and what would be the amount of megapixels I need if I want the print to be able to have fine detail?</p>
","<p>[NOTE: The duplicate linked by Mattdm offers the formula, however I'm not sure that actually answers the question you have asked, so here is some additional thought process and explanation that <em>will</em> hopefully answer the question.]</p>

<p>When it comes down to print size, <em><strong>""How many megapixels?""</strong></em> is not really the right question, at least not initially. Print size is a matter of print resolution and image dimensions (as indicated in the other answer). Your dimensions are fixed, given that you need to print A1 size, so the remaining question is <em><strong>""What print resolution?""</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Resolution can be a funky thing, and you will get a lot of different opinions on the subject. You can go a few ways: for the least common denominator, for the average denominator, or for the most common denominator. To put that another way, print at a high resolution to ensure viewers with high visual acuity see as much detail as possible, print at a ""standard"" resolution to ensure viewers with average visual acuity see an adequate amount of detail, or print with the lowest resolution that will get you a print without requiring a lot of effort to bring out fine detail for the highest acuity viewers. We can associate three primary print resolutions with these <strong>classifications</strong> of print qualities (Canon/Epson resolutions):</p>

<ul>
<li>High Acuity/Fine Detail: 300ppi/360ppi</li>
<li>Average Acuity/Average Detail: 150ppi/180ppi</li>
<li>Low Acuity/Lesser Detail: 50ppi/60ppi</li>
</ul>

<p>An A1 print is fairly large, and people will often view it from a good distance. One could argue that a low resolution ""is all that is needed"" for larger viewing distances of say 5-6 feet (that might be pushing it...A1 is big, but not necessarily huge). That would meet ""classical"" assumptions about human visual acuity, however some of those assumptions have come under fire these days with the advent of new high-resolution display technology like Apple's Retina Display (which many people can clearly see the pixels on at the recommended viewing distance), furthered scientific discovery about the nature of vision and acuity in various lighting (proper illumination can improve acuity), and facts about the widely varying nature of visual acuity amongst broad populations, anywhere from 1/40th of a degree to 1/90th of a degree (a bit less to a bit more than one arc minute or 1/60th of a degree, the standard ""average"" for visual acuity). Lets assume, for the sake of these discussions, that you want ""native"" print resolution, and therefor the ability to print an image in full detail ""strait out of camera"".</p>

<p>If we start with the bare minimum, enough resolution to produce an acceptable print at an average ""comfortable"" viewing distance, you would need 50ppi (or 60ppi with an Epson printer). With 50ppi at 23.39""x33.11"" your image size would need to be 1170x1656 pixels. That would be an image of about 2 megapixels, and viewable from a distance of 5' or more.</p>

<p>At a 150ppi resolution, for A1 print dimensions, your image size would need to be 3509x4967 pixels. That would be an image of about 17.5mp, and would be sufficient for viewing at 2' away. Its certainly not impossible to find an 18mp camera these days...Canon has thoroughly saturated the market with 18mp and 18.1mp cameras the last few years, and both Nikon and Sony have or are releasing 24mp entry-level cameras.</p>

<p>At 300ppi resolution, for A1 print dimensions, your image size would need to be 7017x9933 pixels. That would be an image of about 70mp, and would be sufficient for viewing at a mere foot away.</p>

<p><strong>So, what resolution do you need?</strong> Depends on two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you feel satisfied with the detail when viewing it at a distance that is comfortable to you?</li>
<li>Do you think that your most common viewers will be satisfied with the detail at viewing distances comfortable to them?</li>
</ol>

<p>The first is, really, the more important...as we tend to be harder on and more demanding of ourselves than other people are. If you are comfortable with the detail you get out of a 50ppi print when viewed at greater than 5 feet, then its more likely than not that your viewers will also be quite happy. If you feel your viewers might be more demanding than the average viewer (i.e. such as in a gallery or exhibition setting), or feel that 5 feet is too far, etc. then you might want to opt for a higher resolution. At 150ppi, the minimum viewing distance shrinks to about two feet. That is more than sufficient to accommodate even more demanding viewers with average acuity, even if they step in for a closer look (which might bring them within 2-3 feet.) An 18mp APS-C sized camera sensor captures a lot of fine detail, so at this print resolution for that size print, you'll effectively be printing at ""native"" camera size, and therefor extracting full detail.</p>

<p>Beyond 150ppi, your into the realm where the print will contain more detail than is necessary for an A1 print even when examined more closely by viewers with average visual acuity. If someone with high visual acuity were to step in for a closer look at say 2.5 feet, you would need closer to 200ppi. So that begs the question: Is 300ppi overkill? For an A1 print, Yes and Possibly.  Yes in that a camera capable of a native 70mp is going to be extremely expensive, even to rent, and you would need to make sure the scene you are photographing actually has enough intrinsic fine detail to make it worth while. Macro photos are usually ideal candidates for as much resolution as you can get your hands on. Landscapes can also benefit from high resolution. A lot of other photography, including much portraiture (especially wide-aperture soft-focus portraiture), architectural photography (as architecture tends to have large details but not much fine detail) does not need, or cannot even provide, that much detail. Possibly, as it depends on how precise you want your detail to be. A 200ppi image will need to be scaled 3x (an odd number) to print on a 600ppi native printer (or if you are using an Epson, a 240ppi image will need to be scaled 3x for the printers native 720ppi.) Odd-level scaling can have the tendency to blur a very small bit of detail when using a <em>good</em> scaling algorithm, where as even-level scaling (2x, 4x) tends not to (or at least, not as visibly so.) And <em>every printer</em> (or print driver), regardless of what you send to it, <em>will</em> scale to the devices <em>native resolution</em> before actually printing. It will usually do that scaling with a very cheap, fast form of scaling that can introduce artifacts, funky aliasing and edge chopping, etc. It would be better to manually scale an 18mp image to the necessary dimensions for a 300ppi print than to simply print at 200ppi, if you want to preserve a camera's native 200ppi worth of detail.</p>

<p>Personally, I would say an 18mp image would print fine for a gallery or other kind of exhibition where your viewers might be more demanding. I would also say that a 12mp photo should contain enough of detail to be scaled up to 18mp size, and printed at 150ppi, and be good enough for most viewers. I would say that a 50ppi print is probably too low for exhibition quality, however its probably a moot point anyway as it is likely harder to find a 2mp camera these days than a  6/8/10/12mp camera. If you really want to get the best quality you can, you might want to use a camera with more than 18mp worth of resolution, such as a 21mp full-frame camera or a 24mp APS-C camera, and scale the image down to the native print size. That should improve the clarity and sharpness of detail for an A1 print at 150ppi.</p>

Could somebody explain <em>how to</em> and <em>cons and pros</em> of this technique, who uses it of course.  </p>
","<p>The Black Card Technique is a workaround for the problem of the limited <strong>dynamic range</strong> of digital cameras. The dynamic range of a camera describes the difference in light levels it can record. </p>

<p>The limits of dynamic range are often seen in landscape photography - you will often see photos where the sky is nicely exposed, but the ground is underexposed, or vice versa. This is because the camera can't record enough of a range.</p>

<p>The Black Card Technique attempts to get around this problem by essentially allowing two different exposure times in one shot. The card is used to block the brightest part of the image for the majority of the exposure, allowing the darkest part to be exposed properly without overexposing the bright part.</p>

<p>The technique is relatively simple. Simply set your camera up on a tripod, and set it for spot metering. Meter the ground and note the setting given - let's say you're photographing a sunset and the ground reading is 8 seconds. Now meter for the sky, which will give a faster shutter speed - let's say 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Set the camera to Manual and dial in an 8 second exposure, for the ground. Using either the viewfinder or live view, compose the scene and place the card over the lens so that the sky is covered. Fire the shutter and time 6 seconds, then remove the black card for the final 2 seconds.</p>

<p>The ground, which wasn't covered by the card, has now been correctly exposed for 8 seconds, while the sky was covered for 6 seconds and then exposed for 2 seconds, again correctly as per the meter reading. You should therefore have a shot with correct exposure in both the dark and light parts.</p>

<p>The pros of this technique are that it is cheap and relatively simple to achieve. It precludes the need for multiple Neutral Density filters, which are the 'proper' alternative. However, neutral density filters are less fussy to use, offer a range of gradations for a more natural transition from sky to ground (amongst other things), and offer less chance of introducing camera shake by nudging the lens with the card.</p>

","<p>Condensation is the biggest risk, and prevention is always better than cure.

<p><em>""A large art gallery has hired you to photograph every individual framed painting in the gallery for an upcoming exhibition. They require colour accurate copies of the artwork for use in a catalogue.""</em></p>

<p>And this is my response to the question. </p>

<p><em>Chosen Equipment: Transportable studio flash gear, Tripod, 20mm lens, 135mm lens</em></p>

<p><em>Explanation: Given that the art gallery is going to use colour accurate copies of the artwork for use in a catalogue, a transportable studio flash gear is important so that the correct exposure is achieved, so as to not darken or lighten to much the colours of the artwork. The tripod is needed so as to minimise the amount rotatation adjustment in post production and to get proper dimensions of the artwork. Preferably the camera on the tripod should be adjusted in such a way that the sensor is parallel to the artwork. As for lens choices, i would choose the 20mm and the 135mm prime lenses. The 20mm, just in case there are some very wide paintings so that they can fit on frame and the 135mm so that the painting can be easily framed from a distance. DOF should not be an issue here since, these are catalouge shots.</em></p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>
","<ol>
<li>A flexible tripod with a level from a good brand</li>
<li>A platform with two/three steps for shooting the artwork from an appropriate level (you may need, sometime)</li>
<li>Consult the curator whether they will allow you to use a flash or not. Because in some art studios, it's strictly forbidden to use flash during taking a photo. If they allow using flash, get a ETTL flash (430 Ex II/580 Ex II for Canon is a good one) for correctly exposing the shots at ease. </li>
<li>As you will have tripod, you will not suffer from the risk of shaking or low-light. So get a good lens which will give you better color contrast and sharpness. If you are using Canon, go for EF 17-40 f/4L or 24-70 f/2.8 L</li>
<li>If they use glass in front of those artworks, a CPL filter will be very very handy to avoid reflections of any kind on those glasses. </li>
<li>A reflector may be useful in some cases, buy/rent only if you have some bucks left.</li>
</ol>

<p>Last, always shoot in raw for such types of works which you will save your time to correct the white balance during post processing. Try shooting in full frame to get better dynamic range and color than crops. </p>

","<p>B&amp;H has a long and strong tradition of taking the manufacturer's or official distributor's intent <em>under advisement</em>, and yes, the price you pay for the resulting savings is often the US warranty (for ""grey market"" items). In a case like this, they may have found it to be the cheapest way to put together an intraoral kit for dentists (take the body from an unpopular kit, add an off-brand macro lens, ring light and case, leaving them with a kit lens to sell).</p>

"What is the best auto-focus mode to use for bird photography?","11864","","<p>Consider the image below:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBqMj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
How would the shot be focused here? Using Auto-focus or manual?<br>
If there was a cluttered background, will auto focus detect the small bird and sharply focus on it?<br>If manual focusing, how would you continuously focus on a moving bird?</p>

<p>Also in dynamic situations like this, is it easy to manually focus quickly?</p>
","<p>You will want to use an automatic continuous/servo mode to photograph birds in flight (BIF). Most modern cameras support some kind of servo mode, even entry-level cameras. Using servo mode is only part of the solution to tracking BIF, however. More advanced cameras offer additional AF features, such as multipoint AF Expansion or Zone AF that will use more than one focus point around your key selected point. The use of an AF Expansion/Zone AF mode will improve your tracking ability over the use of a single point. Tracking ability is often dependent on the AF system used, and if you have the option, using a system with more and denser points, particularly those with configurable zones, will improve your ability to track subjects.</p>

<p>Additionally, a denser AF system, such as the newer <em>reticular</em> 51-pt Nikon and 61-pt Canon, offer more points that are more closely spaced together which can greatly assist in subject lock and continuous tracking. Most Canon cameras have a 9-pt AF system that is not reticular, and there is quite a bit of space between each point. The Canon 7D uses a 19-pt AF system that is not reticular, but definitely denser than the standard 9-pt system, and every point is a high precision cross-type point which can identify and lock subjects much more quickly. Canon's 19-pt AF system supports Expansion and Zone AF modes. Canon's newest AF system is their 61-pt AF system with 41 cross-type points in a reticular design. This AF system is currently only found on the 1D X and 5D III bodies, however it is the most advanced AF system available at the current time. It supports full multi-dimensional tracking (frame position, distance, RGB color information), multiple types of zone and expansion AF modes, as well as spot AF (smaller area single-point AF, which can be useful for focusing on very precise locations...say a birds eye). Canon's 61pt system is also the first to offer 5 center double-cross type AF points with ultra high precision for extremely fast focusing.</p>

<p>In Nikon systems, there are 11-pt and 39-pt AF systems in lower-end bodies. The 11-pt systems are roughly similar to Canon 9-pt systems, however their 39-pt system is more of a reticular design. It offers 9 cross-type high precision points around the center. All Nikon AF systems support what they call ""3D Tracking"", which simply means they use frame position, distance, and color information to help inform the AF system of where the subject is likely to be in the next frame, supporting advanced tracking. To use 3D tracking, you must use all 39 points, which is actually less effective than it may sound (more in a bit). Nikon's latest AF system is their new 51-pt, which is also a reticular design. It supports some semblance of Zone AF, although it only works around the center point. The strength of Nikon's system is multi-point f/8 AF...up to 11 points with a single center cross type and 10 surrounding line sensors. This can be a bonus if you intend to use lenses with teleconverters that reduce the maximum aperture to f/8 (i.e. a 600mm f/4 lens with a 2x TC for 1200mm.)</p>

<hr>

<p>If you intend to track birds in flight, your main options are going to be multi-point mode (all points) with dynamic subject tracking. This would be all 9, 19, or 61 points in a Canon body, or all 11, 39, or 51 points in a Nikon body. This is often recommended by each brand, however it is not as effective or guaranteed as it sounds. When using every single AF point, the camera...rather than you, decides which points should be in focus. Its not uncommon for an AF system, even an advanced one, to decide it should focus on something other than your subject, suddenly switching subjects without warning. Additional tracking logic can be used when performing multi-point dynamic AF, and when used right, it can be very accurate...but you will always have that potential for instantaneous subject switching hanging over your head...and when it strikes, you can lose that keeper moment.</p>

<p>In the area of configurable AF tracking for birds, I think Canon has the general edge. Their new Zone and Expansion AF modes allow you to select the AF point you wish to be your key point, and configure how many points around that key point can be used to continue tracking if your subject moves beyond the range of your key point. Expansion mode simply selects the four adjacent points, top/bottom/left/right, and marks them active but secondary in ""spot AF"" mode. If your subject moves away from your selected point and onto one of these four neighboring points, it will continue to track. Zone AF mode is similar, however if will use as many neighboring points as possible, all as full AF points (vs. spot AF points). In the 7D, Zone AF can use up to 9 points at a time, and in the new 61pt AF system you can configure how large the zone is. Tracking birds in flight with Zone and Expansion AF around ANY point is the best way to go, if you have the option. Currently, it is only available on three bodies, the 7D, 5D III, and 1D X.</p>

<p>Nikon offers similar functionality, however I believe it only works around the center point. Nikon's zones extend a strip of line sensors out nearly to the edge of the AF spread range, which helps you continue tracking subjects as they move across the frame. This is a small limitation over the Canon system, but it can still be used effectively. If you have supertelephoto lenses and teleconverters, you can use up to 15 points with lenses that have less than f/8 apertures (such as an f/4 lens with a 1.7x TC), or 11 points with lenses that are f/8 apertures (such as an f/4 lens with a 2x TC or an f/5.6 lens with a 1.4x TC). Some of these points remain cross-type as well, offering high precision, low light, multi-point AF ability, something not currently available on any Canon body.</p>

<p>Finally, you will probably also want to configure your AF system a bit as well. You will want to prioritize AF acquisition and tracking over AF drive and shutter release. This will prevent you from being able to actually start taking pictures until the AF system has a lock on your subject and is able to track. You will also want to support continuous tracking, and avoid shutting off the AF system when it determines the subject has moved beyond the edge of the frame. Finally, you will want to tune the AF system to switch subjects slowly, rather than quickly. A moderate slow setting will be good for most birds, including those with erratic flight. If you are photographing when multiple birds are in flight, using the slowest tracking sensitivity, as that will limit how often the AF system decides to switch from one subject to another when they cross paths in your viewfinder. </p>

"How is ISO implemented in digital cameras?","11856","","<p>If I change the ISO settings on my camera, obviously the gain of the system is increased, amplifying the signal from the sensor. What's not clear to me is where the amplification takes place. I see several possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the sensor, by increasing voltage or some other mechanism</li>
<li>Via an analog amplifier outside of the sensor</li>
<li>Digitally, after the signal has been digitized, but before storing data in the RAW file</li>
<li>As a parameter applied solely in creating an image from RAW</li>
</ol>

<p>If #4 is true, then you could take a 4-stop overexposed RAW picture at ISO 1600, and then in post processing produce a JPEG at ISO 100 that would be the same as if the original photo had been shot at ISO 100.</p>

<p>If #1 or #2 is true, then a RAW file shot at ISO 1600 would actually contain more information about shadows, and an ISO 100 RAW would contain more information about highlights.</p>
","<p>1~2 and 3.  On CCDs, the amplifier is effectively in the corner of the sensor, but on CMOS, there is an amplifier built into each photosite, dispersed throughout the sensor.  See <a href=""http://photo.net/learn/dark_noise/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in one thing I recently <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/23/what-is-something-you-learned-recently-about-your-gear-that-you-wish-you-discover/1698#1698"">discovered</a>, most DSLRs have an amplifier before the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion).  They tend to max at 800 or 1600 ISO and are all digital amplifications afterward.  The following paragraphs assume a camera that maxes out its analog amplification at 1600:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the 12 or 14 bit RAW files prevent you from doing what you describe.  The digital amplification takes place before the RAW files are stored.  There is a maximum value that can be stored, so when you shoot 4-stops overexposed, even though the ADC is not saturated, the RAW file will probably be clipped.  <strong>However, the technique that overexposes just as much as to not clip highlights is effective at reducing noise, and known as ETTR (Expose To The Right).</strong></p>

<p>Yes, due to the analog amplification, RAW files at higher ISO do contain more detail.  However, ISO 1600 and ISO 12800 should contain the same amount of shadow detail (unless there is some additional special processing OR the ADC has effectively more precision than whatever bit depth your RAW files are stored in).  </p>

<p>Even though #3 is true above ISO 1600, an ISO 1600 RAW may contain more information about highlights because they can still be clipped through the digital amplification process.  For this reason and perhaps others (battery life, effective buffer size), when shooting RAW, it may be beneficial to shoot ISO 1600 and simply post process later.  Again, I have not tested this, and if the effective ADC bit-depth is higher than the RAW format's bit-depth, it will not be true.</p>

"Will too much time-lapse photography reduce a DSLR's life, or cause any other damage?","11840","","<p>I own a Canon 550D, and I'm planning to do some time-lapse experiments this weekend just for fun. Will it cause any damage or reduce my DSLR's lifetime if I do too much of it?</p>
","<p>The camera's shutter has usually a rating for 50,000 to 300,000 actuations, depending on the camera. For yours, I think it is closer to 50,000 but you should check the manual to be sure.</p>

<p>That means you can take that many pictures and still be within the manufacturer's life-expectancy for your camera. When you do time-lapse, you take a lot of pictures, so you are going to eat away at that number. How much depends on the time-lapse you expect taking.</p>

<p>That being said, the number of actuations is just the manufacturer's <em>educated guess</em>. It can fail before or after, I have heard of people who managed to shoot 4 times more before the camera's performance became erratic. If it does fail before and you are within the warranty period, you can probably have it fixed at no charge.</p>

"What makes a DSLR camera ""entry-level""?","11801","","<p>When I look around the questions on this site, I feel everyone can clearly tell what makes a DSLR camera ""entry-level"". But I have no clue on how to tell.</p>

<p>What makes a camera model ""entry"" level or ""mid-level enthusiast"" level or something else?<br>
Do they come with an ""entry-level"" sticker on them somewhere? :-)<br>
Or is it the price range (what range?), or the features (what features?), or something else?</p>
","<p>Pragamatically speaking, <strong>entry-level means the cheapest camera any manufacturer currently offers</strong>. It can also mean the category of all such cameras — and as such, it would be theoretically possible for a company to make <em>all</em> or <em>no</em> entry-level cameras, even if they had different options. I don't know of anyone who has decided to leave the higher models off the table, but some of the niche brands like Sigma or Leica arguably have <em>no</em> entry level models, while one could say that both of Nikon's D3xxx and D5xxx series are entry-level. On the other hand, the Hasselblad H5D-40 is the company's ""entry-level"" medium format DSLR -- at $13,000.</p>

<p>So, overall, there is no fixed list of features, or even price category. The common factor is that <strong>entry-level models are cameras marketed at uncertain first purchasers</strong>, either first in a certain category (like first DSLR, or first medium format, or first interchangeable-lens camera), or first camera entirely. As such, the key points tend to be:</p>

<h1>Priced as low as can be gotten away with</h1>

<p>This in turn has two aspects: first, features are eliminated to cut costs. Second, cameras are often priced aggressively with lower margins in order to get people in the door.</p>

<h1>Instant ease-of-use a design priority</h1>

<p>A camera with many buttons and dials is much easier and faster to use once you've mastered the fundamentals of photography and once you know what and where the controls are on that particular camera. But this can have a steep learning curve, scaring away new users. So, entry-level cameras often have simplified user interfaces, with a high focus on automation.</p>

<p>Because this is a marketing construct, I'd argue that if you are really planning to <em>enter</em> photography, ""entry-level"" is not really for you. Aand, in fact I <em>do</em> argue this in another question on this site -- see <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/5883/are-there-disadvantages-to-a-prosumer-camera-for-a-beginner-aside-from-cost"">Are there disadvantages to a prosumer camera for a beginner, aside from cost?</a>.</p>

<h1>Feature selection relative to market position</h1>

<p>Cost-cutting isn't the only reason for feature selection, though. Some features are very low cost but withheld from ""entry-level"" models simply to avoid competing with the same brand's higher models. For Canon and Nikon, their own lines are bigger competition than Pentax, Sony, Olympus, Sigma, or etc., which means that in general, the big two tend to intentionally withhold features from the entry-level models, whereas the smaller companies actually push higher-end features ""down the stack"" in hopes of drawing attention and discerning buyers.</p>

<h1>Practical consequences</h1>

<p>Also because this is a marketing construct, it it's often the case that <strong>such cameras basically <em>do</em> come with a sticker which says ""entry level""</strong>, although it will be couched in other phrases. For example, here are the headlines on the product pages of the three main manufacturers still invested in DSLRs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/dslr-cameras/D3200.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikon D3200</a>: ""Simply Effortless. Simply Stunning""</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_rebel_t3_18_55mm_is_ii_lens_kit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>: ""The Beauty of Simplicity""</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/dslr/K-500_"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pentax K-500</a>: ""Beyond Basics"" (but note that the first line of copy after that is ""Jump right into digital photography with a comfortable, approachable DSLR, paired with high quality specifications that go above and beyond entry level..."")</li>
</ul>

<p>The theme here is <strong>Entry-level cameras are marketed as able to produce beautiful, stunning images with little effort</strong>. Everything else, from the features available to the construction to the price point is really in service of that message. The fundamental goal is to hook you into photography <em>and into that specific brand</em>, so you buy accessories, lenses, and eventually, hopefully, a more expensive body with higher profit margins.</p>

<p>As a rough generalization in the current market, entry level DSLR models:</p>

<ul>
<li>are made less tough (cheaper materials, lower shutter count rating, no weather sealing)</li>
<li>come with a low-cost, versatile zoom lens (usually 18-55mm), because buying lenses is intimidating and the targeted buyer won't have any to begin with</li>
<li>pentamirror instead of more expensive pentaprism, and generally a lower-cost viewfinder</li>
<li>have less sophisticated autofocus — slower, fewer points to select from</li>
<li>have no top LCD or dual control wheels — not just added expense, but they look <em>hard</em></li>
<li>emphasize ""scene modes"" and other hand-holding features, and other more advanced software-based features like auto-bracketing may be missing</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>overall</em> category of entry-level DSLRs usually have APS-C or smaller sensors, 
 but, as in <a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2417947,00.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this review</a>, one can consider cameras like the Canon EOS 6D or the Nikon D610 <em>entry level within their category</em>. Additionally, not all cameras with smaller-than-35mm-film sensors are entry level, with some nice ""mid-tier"", ""intermediate"", or ""prosumer"" APS-C models in the $1000-$2000 price range. Or, consider Nikon's <em>1</em> line, which features a smaller-than-APS C sensor. There, the ""S"" models like the Nikon 1 S2 are designed to be ""entry level"" and the ""V"" models like the Nikon 1 V3 are the ""flagship"" models — all with the same sensor size.</p>

<p>Another particular quirk of DSLR Nikon's lineup is that the lower models do not contain a motor to drive autofocus on lenses without a built-in motor. There's a general trend towards lens-based AF motors (and in fact, <em>all</em> Canon cameras have no motor in the body), so this may or may not be an issue, but if you want wide lens compatibility it's worth considering -- to Nikon, this was something reasonably left out of the entry-level.</p>

<p>Pentax's current ""entry-level"" model, the <a href=""http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/dslr/K-500_"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">K-500</a>, demonstrates the ""smaller maker"" effect here, as that model has dual control dials and a 100%-view pentaprism finder. In fact, on that page, the marketing copy includes the phrase ""beyond entry level"" -- but this clearly <em>is</em> an ""entry level"" model. (This isn't meant to be a pitch for Pentax, although I do use a higher-model Pentax myself; there are other balancing considerations which clearly make the entry-level models from other makers appealing, although as I previously noted I think that anyone serious about getting into photography should look at a higher segment anyway.)</p>

"What makes a Carl Zeiss lens so special in a smartphone?","11797","","<p>There are smartphones on the market that have a focus towards photography. Some are equipped with a Carl Zeiss lens. I have looked into Wikipedia, which tells me that they are a brand who produces lenses. What makes their lenses so special?</p>

<p>What do you think about a 5MP camera in phones, one which is branded Carl Zeiss, versus another one which isn't?</p>
","<p>Carl Zeiss is a very well respected lens maker, with <a href=""http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2015/03/zeiss-camera-lens-business-is-125-today.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">125 years of history</a>, and very literally one of the reasons ""German engineering"" conjures images of precision and care.

"What are the advantages of using the optical viewfinder over live preview to take photos on a DSLR?","11785","","<p>Forgive this novice question, I am basically a complete newbie to photography.  Really, all I've ever used for most my of short life have been point-and-shoots; I've only recently started to pick up some curiosity.</p>

<p>Anyway, from what I've gathered, reading through many of the <a href=""/questions/tagged/camera-basics"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;camera-basics&#39;"" rel=""tag"">camera-basics</a> questions, most serious photographers use the optical viewfinder as their primary tool to determine what makes a good shot.  Live-preview isn't used much at all; it seems its help is to primarily set up the shot.  Reading a Wikipedia article seems to confirm this view, adding that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[l]ive preview in DSLRs does not typically serve as their principal means of framing and previewing before taking a photograph, with this function still being mainly performed with optical viewfinder. While initially largely <em>a novelty feature</em>, live-preview functionality has become more common on DSLR cameras... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are the myriad advantages of using the viewfinder over live preview, what does it help one accomplish in achieving the goals of photography?</p></li>
<li><p>What are some interesting ways serious photographers use live preview to take better shots they might have otherwise missed?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Using live preview means that the camera must be held out in front of the photographer... This is not inherently an especially stable way to hold a camera- especially if the photographer has to hold it that way for a while- because it offers very little additional support for the arms... Pulling the camera up close and using a viewfinder allows the photographer to stabilize the camera because it is closer in to the body. Additionally, live preview becomes more unwieldy the heavier the camera equipment gets, and DSLRs by their very nature are much heavier than the typical P&amp;S... Add a large lens on the front of the camera, and it becomes nearly impossible to use live view handheld.</p>

<p>The other major drawback of live view is that because it requires the mirror to be locked up, it means that the auto focusing mechanism is unavailable. Live view actually uses a different AF technique- one that is quite a bit slower than a DSLRs main autofocus. Obviously this means that in environments where it is necessary to focus quickly and accurately, live view doesn't make for an ideal situation.</p>

<p>Where live view comes in very handy is when taking pictures where it's difficult or impossible to get ones eye up to the viewfinder. A good example of this might be the photographer at a wedding who wants to get shots of the crowded dance floor. Prior to live view he would simply hold the camera above his head, snap off pictures, and pray that some of them had decent framing. With live view it is actually possible to frame up a shot while holding the camera over the head on shots such as these.</p>

<p>Additionally, live view can be a great option where there is no need for the stability needed by pulling the camera in close to the body, such as when it is on a tripod, and/or where there is no requirement for speed inthe autofocusing of shots.</p>

"How to avoid jpeg compression artefacts when saving photos in web resolution?","11773","","<p>When I save a web-resolution image (for example, 1920×1024px), flat areas tints often have damaged shades of color. I'm saving in Photoshop CS4 with quality 2 in standard mode, because I need the files to be less than 300k. How can I make my JPEG images this small without the compression artefacts?</p>

<p>An example: <a href=""http://www.screencast.com/users/capsize/folders/Jing/media/f858e229-1f05-431c-98ce-5334918aa1f3"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.screencast.com/users/capsize/folders/Jing/media/f858e229-1f05-431c-98ce-5334918aa1f3</a></p>
","<p>If you save a JPEG image with an extremely low quality level, you WILL get compression artifacts. Its just a simple fact of JPEG lossy compression. If you wish to avoid compression artifacts, use a higher quality setting than 2. You won't need to save at maximum quality, as most images can be saved with a fairly low quality setting without noticeable loss in detail or visible artifacts.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that smooth gradients and JPEG do not mix well. JPEG compresses small blocks of the image, and when it comes to smooth gradients, it tends to make all the pixels in a block the same or very similar colors. This creates distinct banding (posterization) that can be quite visible. The only way around this is to use a higher quality setting, however that will obviously increase your file size.</p>

<p>An excellent article that might be of help can be found here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/jpeg-quality"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">An Analysis of Lightroom JPEG Export Quality Settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The above is for Lightroom, however the fundamental concept still applies to Photoshop. The important point from the article above is that the lower range of quality settings for JPEG tend to have a minor effect on image size, and it is only when you get to the upper few brackets that image size starts to climb by any significant degree. I would suspect that you could change your quality setting from 2 to 5 and only incur a small hit to your image size.</p>

"What is the 18% gray tone, and how do I make a 18% gray card in Photoshop?","11772","","<p>I have heard about 18% gray tone — what is it really, and why 18% (and not 20% or some other value), and how can I make it in Photoshop?</p>
","<p>Warning: this is a long, somewhat technical post that includes some math (but when you get past the superscripts and such, it's ultimately pretty simple math). </p>

<p>First of all, I should start with a simple idea of how I believe 18% was selected in the first place. I can't remember which one any more, but one of Ansel Adams' books mentions what I think is probably the origin. </p>

<p>About the most reflective naturally occurring substance on earth is fresh, clean snow, which reflects somewhere around 95% of the light falling on it (depending a little on exactly how fresh, how clean, how cold and/or moist it was when the snow formed, etc.)</p>

<p>At the opposite extreme, a surface covered in fresh, clean soot reflects about the least light of any naturally occurring substance. The range here is from about 3 to 4%. Let's again take the middle of that range, and call it 3.5%.</p>

<p>To can an overall average, we can then average those two. However, given such a wide range, the statisticians tell use an arithmetic mean produces a poor result (the larger number dominates almost completely, and the smaller one is nearly ignored). For numbers like this, a geometric mean is the ""correct"" way to do things.</p>

<p>The geometric mean of these works out as the square root of .95 * .035. Running that through the calculator, we get 0.1823458... Rounded to two places that's 18%.</p>

<p>Since the Thom Hogan article has been cited, I'll talk a bit about it. Some time ago, Thom Hogan published an article:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bythom.com/graycards.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.bythom.com/graycards.htm</a></p>

<p>...that claims meters in Nikon digital cameras are calibrated for a mid-level grey that corresponds to 12% reflectance rather than the 18% grey of most standard grey cards.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the title and opening paragraph of the article are quite emphatic about 18% being a “myth”, the remainder of the article fails to provide much factual basis for this claim. Here’s what Thom gives as the basis for his statements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ANSI standards (which, unfortunately, are not publically published--you have to pay big bucks to have access to them), calibrate meters using luminance, not reflection. For an ANSI calibrated meter, the most commonly published information I've seen is that the luminance value used translates into a reflectance of 12%. I've also seen 12.5% and 13% (so where the heck does Sekonic's 14% come from?), but 12% seems to be correct--one half stop lighter than 18%, by the way. I haven't seen anyone claim that ANSI calibration translates into a reflectance of 18%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, he seems to have no real basis for his claims, merely a statement that “12% seems to be correct,” with no real evidence, or even information about why he considers this correct. Despite this, however, this article is now widely cited on various photographically oriented web sites (among other places) as if it were absolute and indisputable fact.</p>

<p>Since this issue seems to be of interest to a fair number of photographers, I decided to see if I could find some real facts with evidence to support them. The first step in this journey was to find the standard in question. Doing some searching, I found what I believe is the relevant standard. Contrary to Thom’s implication above, this is really published by the ISO rather than ANSI. This may be trivial to most, but when I was looking for the standard it was somewhat important – I put in a fair amount of work trying to find an ANSI standard that apparently does not exist. In the end, however, I found the relevant ISO standard: ISO 2720-1974, “Photography - General purpose photographic exposure meters (photoelectric type) - Guide to product specification (First edition - 1974-08-15)”.</p>

<p>I also found that Thom was (at least from my viewpoint) quite mistaken about prices as well – a copy of this standard costs only $65 US. This didn't strike me as ""big bucks"" -- in fact, it seemed like a fair price to pay for some real enlightenment (pun noted by not really intended) on the subject.</p>

<p>The standard confirmed part of what Thom had to say, such as calibrating meters directly from sources that emit light rather than from reflected light. Unfortunately, other parts of what Thom had to say are not quite so closely aligned with the content of the standard. For example, at the conclusion of his article, he includes a comment from “lance” that mentioned a ""'K' factor"", without specifying its exact meaning or purpose. Thom replied by saying: “No manufacturer I've talked to knows anything about a K factor, though, and they all speak specifically about the ANSI standard as their criteria for building and testing meters.”</p>

<p>As stated, this may not be exactly wrong – but it’s certainly misleading at best. In reality, a large part of the ISO standard is devoted to the K factor. Much of the rest is devoted to the C factor, which corresponds to the K factor, but is used for incident light meters instead (the K factor applies only to reflected light meters). It would be utterly impossible to follow the standard (at least with respect to a reflected light meter) without knowing (quite a lot) about the K factor.</p>

<p>The standard specifies that: “The constants K and C shall be chosen by statistical analysis of the results of a large number of tests carried out to determine the acceptability to a number of observers, of a number of Photographs, for which the exposure was known, obtained under various conditions of subject matter and over a range of luminances.”</p>

<p>The standard also specifies a range within which the K factor must fall. The numbers for the range depend on the method used for measuring/rating film speed (or its equivalent with a digital sensor). For the moment, I’m going to ignore the DIN-style speeds, and look only at the ASA-style speed ratings. For this system, the allowable range for the K factor is 10.6 to 13.4. These numbers do not correspond directly to reflectance values (e.g. 10.6 doesn't imply a 10.6% grey card as mid-level grey), but they do correspond to different levels of illumination that will be metered as mid-level grey. In other words, there is not one specific level of reflectance that is required to be metered as mid-level grey – rather, any value within the specified range is allowable.</p>

<p>The K factor is related to a measured exposure by the following formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>K = LtS / A<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>K = K factor<br>
  L = Luminance in cd/m<sup>2</sup><br>
  A = f-number<br>
  t = effective shutter speed<br>
  S = film speed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using this formula and a calibrated monitor, we can find the K factor for a specific camera. For example, I have a Sony Alpha 700 camera and a monitor that’s calibrated for a brightness of 100 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Doing a quick check, my camera meters the screen (displaying its idea of pure white) with no other visible light sources, at an exposure of 1/200th of a second at f/2. Running this through the formula, gives a K factor of 12.5 – just above the middle of the range allowed by the standard.</p>

<p>The next step is to figure up what level of “grey” on a card that corresponds to. Let’s do that based on the sunny f/16 rule, which says a proper exposure under bright sunlight is f/16 with a shutter speed that’s the reciprocal of the film speed. We can mathematically transform the formula above to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>L = A<sup>2</sup>K/tS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s work things out for ISO 100 film:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>L = 16x16xK/.01x100</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The .01 and 100 cancel (and they will always cancel since the rule is that the exposure time is the reciprocal of the film speed), so this simplifies to: L = 256K.</p>

<p>Working the numbers for the lowest and highest allowable values for the K factor gives 2714 and 3430 respectively. </p>

<p>Now, we run into the reason the ISO standard specifies light levels rather than reflectance of a surface – even though we’ve all seen and heard the sunny f/16 rule, the reality is that clear sunlight varies over a considerable range, depending on season, latitude, etc. Clear sunlight has brightness anywhere from about 32000 to 100000 lux. The average of that range is about 66000 lux, so we’ll work the numbers on that basis. This has to be multiplied by the reflectance to give a luminance – but the result from that comes out in units of “apostilbs” rather than cd/m<sup>2</sup>. To convert from apostilbs to cd/m<sup>2</sup>, we multiply by 0.318:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>L = I x R x 0.318.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R = reflectance<br>
  I = Illuminance (in Lux)<br>
  L = luminance (in cd/m<sup>2</sup>)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We already have the values for L that we care about, so we’ll rearrange this to give the values of R:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R = L / 0.318 I</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plugging in our minimum and maximum values for I, we get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R<sub>1</sub> = L / 10176<br>
  R<sub>2</sub> = L / 31800</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we plug in the two values for L to define our allowable range for R:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R<sub>1,1</sub> = 2714 / 10176<br>
  R<sub>1,2</sub> = 2714 / 31800<br>
  R<sub>2,1</sub> = 3430 / 10176<br>
  R<sub>2,2</sub> = 3430 / 31800  </p>
  
  <p>R<sub>1,1</sub> = .27<br>
  R<sub>1,2</sub> = .085<br>
  R<sub>2,1</sub> = .34<br>
  R<sub>2,2</sub> = .11  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, between the range of brightness of the sun and the range of K factors allowed by the ISO standard, a reflectance anywhere from about 8.5% to about 34% can fall within the requirements of the standard. This is obviously a very wide range of values – and one that clearly includes both the 12% Thom advocates and the 18% of a typical grey card. </p>

<p>To narrow the range a bit, let’s consider just the arithmetic and geometric mean of the range of brightness from the sun: 66000 and 56569 lux respectively. Plugging these into the formula for the range of possible reflectance values gives:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R<sub>1,1</sub> = 2714 / 20988<br>
  R<sub>1,2</sub> = 2714 / 17989<br>
  R<sub>2,1</sub> = 3430 / 20988<br>
  R<sub>2,2</sub> = 3430 / 17989  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The results from those are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R<sub>1,1</sub> = .13<br>
  R<sub>1,2</sub> = .15<br>
  R<sub>2,1</sub> = .16<br>
  R<sub>2,2</sub> = .19  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>An 18% grey card is close to one end of this range, but still falls within the range. A 12% grey card falls outside the range; we have to assume an above-average light level for it to work out. If we average the four numbers above together, we get a value of about 16% grey as being the ""ideal"" – one that should work out reasonably well under almost any condition.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ISO standard allows a range of calibrations, not just one level</li>
<li>Normal daylight brightness covers a fairly wide range as well</li>
<li>18% grey is justifiable based on average light levels</li>
<li>12% grey is not justifiable based on average light levels</li>
<li>Based on average light levels, the ideal value for a grey card would be about 16%</li>
<li>You meter might be calibrated to 18%, but probably isn't (and shouldn't be) calibrated to 12%.</li>

"How can I do astrophotography with my 70-300mm lens?","11755","","<p>I got a Nikon 70-300mm lens as it was on discount. I want to know if I can do astrophotography with it? I want to maximize the use of the lens. I wanted to get a  34-300 mm lens, but it was expensive.</p>

<p>I own an N90. How can I do astrophotography or tele with my 70-300 mm lens? What are the lens' capabilities and limitations?</p>
","<p><strong>To do astrophotography with a 70-300mm lens using a film camera is a challenge, but is possible.</strong> One of the limiting factors is the speed of the film you use. In general you need a very fast speed film to do astrophotography, especially with longer focal lengths such as 300mm. This is because as the Earth rotates on its axis, the stars appear to move across the sky and they do so much faster than most people think. Here are some tips on how to do astrophotography with your N90 and 70-300mm lens.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stabilize the camera/lens</strong> You will not be able to take photos of any night sky objects, other than the moon, at shutter speeds that will allow you to handhold your camera. A sturdy tripod that won't blow around in the wind is the minimum requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Use the fastest film you can find</strong> Something like <a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/142802-REG/Ilford_1887710_Delta_3200_Professional_135_36_B_W.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ilford Delta-3200 B&amp;W film</a>. It has an actual sensitivity of around ISO 1250 to ISO 1600, but can be 'push processed' to ISO 3200 and beyond. With an f/4-5.6 lens, 'beyond' is what you are looking at. When you have the film processed, be sure to tell the lab to 'push' the speed to around ISO 6400.</li>
<li><strong>Use your lens' maximum (widest) aperture</strong> This will be the aperture setting with the lowest number. AT 70mm your lens probably has a maximum aperture of f/4 and at 300mm a maximum aperture of f/5.6.</li>
<li><strong>Focus manually to 'infinity'</strong> You may have to do a little bit of preparation before it gets dark. Point your camera at an extremely distant object and focus on it. Make a note of the position on the lens' focus scale. You can also use the moon if it is above the horizon. Don't assume the infinity mark on your lens is absolutely accurate. It is probably close, but focusing on stars is critical. You should be able to verify correct focus in your viewfinder by looking at one of the brightest stars in the sky through your viewfinder. Fine tune if necessary, but if you get too far out of focus the stars will disappear as the light from them is spread out over too large an area.</li>
<li><strong>Limit your shutter speed</strong> If your camera is on a stationary mount, divide 600 by the focal length you are using. That is the <em>longest</em> shutter speed you can use that will show the stars as points on an 8x10 print. Anything longer will cause them to show up as trails. For 70mm, that figures to 8 seconds or so. At 300mm, it goes down to 2 seconds. You can double the shutter speed for a 4x6 print (divide 300 by the focal length). Even with very fast film, you're not going to capture many stars at f/5.6 and 2 seconds. Be sure to point your lens at areas that have several bright stars, such as Orion, Canis Major, or Gemini.</li>
<li><strong>Consider a tracking mount</strong> This will allow you to use longer shutter speeds than covered above and will allow you to capture much dimmer stars in your photos. Many telescopes have mounts that, when lined up with the Earth's axis, will track along the path stars take across the sky. Adding a motor that moves the mount very steadily at the same rate as the Earth rotates allows the telescope to stay pointed at the same spot in the sky's constellations. Many photographers will modify their telescope to allow them to attach their camera and let it 'piggyback' on the telescope. If the mount is made for a smaller, lighter telescope then the mount needs to be adapted to hold the camera <em>instead of</em> the telescope.</li>
<li><strong>Use the darkest skies you can find</strong> Find a spot away from heavy light pollution to take your photos of the night sky. Also, unless the moon itself is your target plan your sessions at times before the moon rises or after it has set. The darker the sky the better your results will be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Photographing the moon is entirely different than the stars. You can use ISO 200 film, an aperture of f/8, and a shutter speed of around 1/250th second when the moon is more than about 15-20° above the horizon. You'll still need a tripod for good results at that shutter speed and 300mm.</p>

"High speed sync Flash with 430EX II off-camera","11727","","<p>I have a Canon 6D and a Speedlite 430EX II. It supports HHS, which works fine when the flash is mounted on the camera.</p>

<p>Since I'd like to use it off-camera I bought the inexpensive Yongnuo triggers RF-603II, but it seems that they don't work on exposures shorter than 1/250. This is unfortunate, because in some occasions I need faster speeds, like when I shoot with a wide aperture. Then, because of the ambient light, I need to decrease the shutter speed.</p>

<p>Is there a way to use HSS off-camera with the current equipment, or with additional minimum investment?</p>

<p>If it makes any difference, I also have the Yongnuo flash YN560III.</p>
","<p>There's no way to use HSS between your 6D and 430EX or YN560III with those triggers. The triggers themselves are not capable of syncing at faster than 1/320 second for a single pulse.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a <em>Neutral density</em> filter to allow you to shoot at the apertures you want without exceeding your camera's sync speed. You may or may not have enough power with the 430EX II or the YN560III to provide enough fill when using an ND filter, but if that is the case then using them in HSS mode would provide even less power to offset the same bright conditions!</p>

<p>Can one of the many photo editors max a photo automatically while preserving the same quality?</p>

<p>The answer is the max size a photo can be enlarged is the size of the original photo.</p>
","<p>No.  Photo editing software cannot recover image detail that is not there in the image originally captured at the scene by your camera.  So, enlarging the photo to a very large size will eventually reveal a lack of detail.</p>

<p>Apparent print quality depends a lot on the combination of print size and viewing distance.   If you take your photo, print it A2-size and view it from 10m, it will look good.   If you walk up to it and view it from 0.2m, it will look worse.  No matter what the resolution of the photo, pretty much.</p>

<p>To state this again differently, printing the photo larger will always generate a worse looking photo, unless you also increase the viewing distance.  </p>

<p>For standard viewing distances, around an arm's length perhaps, many people find around 300dpi sufficient.    Meaning, if the image is 1"" x 1"", it needs to be 300 pixels per side.   If you double the distance, you can halve the number of dpi you need.   If you double the image size, you will need double the number of pixels per side for similar quality.</p>

<p>The camera I use most produces images at 4288*2844.   At 300dpi, I can produce a print as large as 14"" * 9.5"" before I start to notice falloff in quality at normal viewing distances (that is, 4288 / 300 = 14.293333... which I rounded to 14 inches).   </p>

<p>There are image editing plugins (for Photoshop for example) that help you resize a photo with good subjective quality by <em>inventing</em> image detail that really wasn't in the original photograph, but looks believable, and doing things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anti-Aliasing</a> to reduce the incongruous appearance of the magnified pixels.   <a href=""http://www.alienskin.com/blowup/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alien Skin <i>Blow Up 3</i></a> is an example, but I have never used it.</p>

Depending on your camera (it would help if you offered more information on that part), you should expose (i.e. meter) for the scene outside - as if there were no people, and you simply wanted to take a photo of the outside view - and simply fire the flash (in most cases, TTL flashes are smart enough to figure out what you want to do). Occasionally, you might want to use some flash exposure compensation, for a more natural result (anywhere from -0.7 to -1.7, depending a lot on the given situation)</p>

","<h1>How to Find a Second-Shooter Gig</h1>

<h3>(A Brief Primer to the Somewhat harsh Realities of the Wedding Photography Industry)</h3>

<hr>

<h1>No, Really... How do I Find a Gig?</h1>

<p>The most reliable way to find <em>high-quality</em> second-shooter gigs is to research the photographers in your area, check out their websites, and directly contact any photographers whose work you like to give them your information and let them know you're available. It is very common for wedding photographers to ask if you want to be an assistant and work your way into a second-shooter position. The right answer to this questions is: <em>""Absolutely! What do you need?""</em> Be prepared to work a wedding or two for free doing the grunt work tasks (toting gear, getting coffee, assembling light stands, getting coffee, holding reflectors, getting coffee, herding family, etc.) in order for the photographer to 'build trust in you.' </p>

<p>This is a somewhat shady, but <em>very</em> common practice in the wedding industry and I generally advise young photographers to simply 'go with it'... but only for a wedding or two with any given wedding photographer. If you haven't seen a 'promotion' to second-shooter, or some indication that one is coming your way after a wedding or two, you're probably simply being used as free labor and it might be time to have a frank conversation, or cut your losses. :-/ The rule of thumb whether assisting, or being a second-shooter is 'be the first to get there, last to leave, hardest working Johnny on-the-spot guy (or gal) in the operation.' That's what gets you to the top of a photographers list of 'people to call' when they need help. Keep your ears and eyes open and your mouth shut and you can find out a <em>ton</em> about what to do (and what <em>not</em> to do) when you become a wedding photographer.</p>

<p><em>Never</em> use Craigslist to find second-shooter gigs. Almost without exception the folks who advertise for wedding photography on Craigslist are the ones who do low-quality, high-volume work. There will be very little (if anything) that you'll be able to learn about the <em>craft</em> of wedding photography from them (very often they are just learning themselves and have nothing to teach) and most of the time they are the sort of people who work without contracts (see the last part of this answer for why this is terrible for you)...</p>

<h2>What to Expect from the Legit Gigs you Do Find</h2>

<p>With that out of the way... In my experience (and from the lead photographers point-of-view), 'second shooter gigs' tend to come in one of three flavors:</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee:</strong> The lead photographer pays the second shooter a set rate for their services. Most of the time flat fee second shooters are in a work-for-hire arrangement, and you can expect that (unless the photographer is a noob, or unusually generous) the photographer will insist that you perform your work in a work-for-hire arrangement. In other words, they get the pictures you take, can claim them as their own, and you cannot use them for your portfolio. This is <em>by far</em> the most common arrangement for second shooters in the wedding industry, though more-often-than-not it is only offered to 'trusted associates' and people who have proven to the lead photographer that they can take 'client ready' photographs. It would be very rare to be offered this sort of arrangement in your first gig with a photographer unless you already come packin' a pretty epic portfolio of your own.</p>

<p><strong>No fee:</strong> The lead photographer doesn't pay a second shooter, but they do get to use any pictures they take as portfolio pieces. This is almost never an option unless the lead photographer is fairly new and building his or her own portfolio, or is unusually generous. This is because most working wedding photographers who <em>aren't</em> new would much rather pay someone a flat fee so they don't ever end up having to explain to potential clients why pictures from the wedding they 'supposedly' shot are also on someone elses website. In essence it is only someone who has either under-quoted their fee to their client (and as such cannot afford to pay a second shooter), or is new to the industry (and thus doesn't have enough clout or enough contacts to have a 'stable' of second shooters the use on a regular basis) who willingly chooses a 'no fee' arrangement. </p>

<p><strong>Apprentice:</strong> the lead photographer doesn't pay the second shooter (in fact, often the second shooter pays a fee to the lead photographer), and the second shooter is in a work-for-hire arrangement, so they don't get to keep any of the images nor use them in their portfolio. Why would anyone willingly choose this option when it seems like the 'worst of both the above options?' Generally this is the option that you end up with if you are absolutely new (e.g. easy to take advantage of because you've got nothing the lead photographer needs), or if you're more experienced but the lead photographer is very well known and/or the wedding is a large one, or for famous people... The assumption in this situation is that what you get out of the deal is the experience of tailing a well-known photographer, or the experience of shooting a wedding you may not otherwise be qualified to shoot... This arrangement is often the 'norm' in big cities, where photographers looking to break into wedding photography are a dime-a-dozen.</p>

<h2>But What's in it for Me???</h2>

<p>Now you'll notice that none of these arrangements (in general) favor the second shooter. Yep. Welcome to the bottom rung of the food chain (Well, second to the bottom... The assistants are below you) in the wedding photography industry. 'How to build your wedding photography portfolio' is another question entirely, but (again, generally speaking) most of the time 'go be a second shooter' is <em>not</em> the way to do that. The above arrangements do offer you some value: experience, industry contacts, and sometimes cash, which is often the best deal to be made with second shooting. A common sentiment that often gets expressed by wedding photographers is 'go build your portfolio on your own dime, not mine.'</p>

<p>Once you've been in the wedding photography business a while and you're seen more as a peer than a lackey the treatment is often better... Second shooting is done more as a 'favor/courtesy' for fellow photographers and they 'owe you one' and will (often) help you out when you need a second and they're available. Depending on where you live, if the professionals in the area are well organized and work together frequently this may make it really tough to 'break in' because why would someone want to take a chance on an untested noob, when they can just call in a pro who's work they already know and who (more importantly) already has a portfolio of their own so they won't come bugging them to 'just use that one shot I took that is soooooo awesome for my portfolio and website pleeeeeese?!' </p>

<p>My only advice in these kinds of markets is to check in periodically with photographers (don't be a pest, though), and be patient until you get that first call... Then when you do get that call, work your @ss off like you've never worked before. Work hard and produce good pictures and word will get around. If you make someone look good and their business more successful, you'll get more calls. Conversely, if you make the lead photographer look bad, you force him/her to babysit you, you're generally annoying, a pain in the @ss, or you are sub-par in any way (regardless of whether it was your fault or not... Excuses don't play) you can expect to never get called again at best, or blacklisted at worst. Hey, it's a harsh world out there. If you wanted it easy you should have stayed in college and become an accountant like your momma told you to. :-)</p>

<h2>Danger, Will Robinson!</h2>

<p>Whatever type of second-shooting situation arrangement you find yourself in, insist on a contract! Unless the photographer is brand-new (or not especially bright), they will have one... In fact, I'd be wary if any photographer who doesn't bring it up with you <em>first</em>. :-) This will clearly define your responsibilities and the expectations that the primary shooter has for you, and will (if it's written correctly) indemnify you from a whole host of 'bad possibilities' that could happen as a result of working as a second shooter. Never work without it. </p>

<p>One of my photographer friends found himself on the receiving end of a lawsuit on the very first wedding he ever shot (as a second shooter) when the primary photographer skipped town without delivering a couple's wedding photographs. Since they couldn't find the primary photographer, who do you think got served with the papers? You guessed it. He weathered the storm and has been successfully shooting weddings for more than 5 years now, but all of that could have been avoided had he insisted on a contract (and the primary photographers shady nature probably would have been brought out up front, as he wasn't using <em>any</em> contracts)...</p>

<h2>A Final Note...</h2>

<p>As with anything in life, your mileage may vary. If you live and work outside of the US, none of the above may apply to you <em>at all</em>, as the only experience I have is in the American wedding industry. Generally speaking in bigger American communities the above will hold 'more true' than in smaller ones (if anything some areas of the US can be <em>harsher</em> than I've described... It can be an absolute soul-sucking bloodbath starting out in mega-big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and New York... 'If you can make it there you can make it... bla, bla, bla...') Conversely, if you live in a smaller community, or in a community with a photographer (or group of photographers) who really believes in teaching and training people to be better photographers, the atmosphere can be downright genteel. Having said all of this I'll leave it with this one final thought (also from personal experience)... If you think the wedding photography industry is harsh, you should try breaking in to Hollywood! <em>Yikes.</em> Now <em>there</em> is a chum filled shark-tank for you... Be grateful you've chosen an easy career-field to enter. ;-)</p>

"I rewound but the film position dial is stuck at ""S.."" Is my camera (brand new Vivitar E3800N) broken?","11663","","<p>I want to bring the roll position displayed back to Zero. How can I do this without having any film in the camera? </p>

<p>If i rotate the cylinder (by hand) that is connected (perhaps) to the film advance lever on the inside of the camera, still the dial does not show change in the position (still at ""S..""). Is this normal? </p>

<p>Earlier I ended up wounding the entire film without any change to this dial. </p>

<p>The shutter button is stuck too (this is perhaps because the roll position is at ""S.."" )</p>
","<p>I don't know about your specific model, but many roll film cameras will not reset the exposure count until you open the film door (the back of the camera). That was pretty much universal among the 35mm SLRs and rangefinders I've owned over the years. The frame count is generally hooked up mechanically to the film advance mechanism, which is disengaged when the film is being rewound (the rewind button releases a toothed clutch on the take-up spool, disconnecting it from the film advance and shutter-cocking gear train).</p>

<p>The ""S..."" is probably indicating that the start of the film (the tongue) hasn't been moved yet. You normally have to advance two frames before you actually get to usable film (since the tongue protrudes and will be exposed when loading). Try ""dry firing"" the camera without any film loaded. You should see the frame counter advancing as you shoot (provided that you aren't pressing the rewind button at the time). If that's working properly, the problem is either with the way you've loaded the film or with that particular roll of film (a mechanical problem within the canister).</p>

"What is sharpness vs. clarity in photo editing software?","11633","","<p>I have been using Lightroom and Photoshop Pro for past 7 months. For all my photos, I used to increase the sharpness using the options available. I now see another option called 
<em>clarity</em>, and when I use it, I see the that the image's sharpness gets improved considerably, compromising some quality.</p>

<p>I now face a strange problem: when I upload such a image with increased <em>clarity</em> to Facebook, I see some downgrading of the image after upload, with so much of noise. This issue didn't appear when uploading to 500px. If I undo the clarity changes and just increase the sharpness, it looks fine in Facebook.</p>

<p>Given this, I have concerns whether to use the <em>clarity</em> option or not. What are the differences, and when should I use <em>clarity</em> and when should I use <em>sharpen</em>?</p>
","<p>The difference between sharpness and clarity, is basically that clarity is a sharpness applied with a very large radius, a relatively low amount, and mostly to the midtones.</p>

<p>This means that you have to use very much of clarity to get the same sharpening effect as sharpness, which also means that you add a lot of local contrast around details.</p>

<p>When the images are compressed using JPEG, it's exactly that high local contrast that is hardest to compress, so it's there that you will notice the compression artifacts very clearly. As the clarity uses a large radius, the effect is still there if you scale down the image, while normal sharpening disappears at the same rate that you scale down the image.</p>

<p>Use sharpness for normal sharpening, and use just a little bit of clarity to counter unwanted softness of the image.</p>

"What Nikon lens for both macro and portrait?","11604","","<p>All three lenses are available at a local store near me:</p>

<ul>
<li>85mm 1.8 at about 400USD </li>
<li>85mm 1.4 at about 1000USD</li>
<li>105mm 2.8 at about 1015 USD</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan on doing macro and portrait photography and have the ff thoughts so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can save a lot with the 85mm 1.8 and a site claims that AF-wise it is much faster than the 85mm 1.4 at twice the price</li>
<li>105mm has VR but I don't know if that would be of much use with portrait and macro as I usually don't use slow shutter speeds with such subjects</li>
<li>105mm has AF-S which means I can get better insect shots because of the silence( and the 105 mm range)</li>
<li>I don't know why I should prefer the 85mm 1.4 over the 105mm, when the 85mm may only have AF speed as an advantage, though I am not so sure if it is faster</li>
</ul>

<p>so as you can see, I'm leaning towards 105mm f/2.8 or 85mm f/1.8 and less towards the 85mm f/1.4. However, I don't want to finalize the decision as many also claims that the 85mm f/1.4 is so good.</p>

<p>Any professional insights to add in helping me make the decision?</p>
","<p>This is all very personal of course. I have the 85mm 1.8, and a friend has the 1.4.  I would gladly do an even swap, but at more than double the price, it wouldn't be worth it to me to pay extra for the 1.4.  If I did weddings maybe I could justify it, but I'd rather put the savings into something else.  It's a bit more solidly built, slightly better IQ, but for me, no, not worth the extra cost.</p>

<p>I also have the 105mm macro.  I get a lot more use out of it than the 85mm lens.  I use the 85mm solely for portraits (but when I do people shots it's my go to lens). </p>

<p>I never use the 105mm for portraits.  It's usable, but it doesn't have the bokeh of the 85mm lenses.  Doesn't AF that fast either.  For portraits I either use the 85mm or an 80-200 zoom, which towards the 200mm end throws the backgrounds out of focus and has nice bokeh.</p>

<p>AF on the macro is especially slow, and hunts a bit, at macro distances - you may be manually focusing up close.  The VR is sometimes usable doing hand-held garden shots (less than 1:1).  I've never known AF noise to scare off insects, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p>What I would recommend is finding an old 105mm AF-D.  They would be half the price or less than the VR.  Buy one of those, plus the 85mm 1.8 and you can have both for the price of the other lenses (85mm 1.4 or 105mm VR).  </p>

"What tripod heads are ideal to mount a large telephoto or supertelephoto lens on a tripod?","11600","","<p>I am in the market to purchase a large, fast telephoto (up to 300mm) or supertelephoto (400mm or longer) lens. These lenses are long and heavy, do to their very wide apertures. The shorter ones, 300mm and 400mm, have f/2.8 apertures, meaning their entrance pupils are 107mm and 143mm in diameter respectively. The 500mm, 600mm, and 800mm lenses are even larger and longer to accomodate their focal lengths, with apertures of 125mm, 150mm, and 143mm. All of these lenses weigh between 5.5 pounds and 12 pounds, depending on the length and generation.</p>

<p>I need a tripod head that will provide stable use and fluid pan &amp; tilt freedom. I have used the Canon EF 300mm f/2.8 L IS II lens with a Gitzo ball head, and these lenses are much to large and heavy for effective operation with such a head. A ball head is rather risky as well, as they often simply can't handle the weight and tilt under it, which can greatly unbalance the whole setup, causing the entire (very expensive) setup to topple over. This at the very least scuffs up the expensive equipment, and at worst can break the lens or the camera body.</p>

<p>Are there any other tripod head designs that will support such large lenses?</p>
","<p><strong>Ball Heads</strong></p>

<p>Ball heads are probably the most popular type of tripod head. They are small, light weight, simple to use, and often come with a panning option. Most ball heads support a quick release mechanism, making it easy to mount and dismount the camera for changing out lenses and the like. For the majority of lenses, ball heads are quite ideal, and offer good balance and stability.</p>

<p>When it comes to telephoto lenses, the camera assembly tends to cater towards imbalance on most ball heads. Smaller lenses attached to a camera have much tighter weight distribution, and most of that weight is centered directly over the ball head (for medium telephoto lenses like 100-135mm lenses, possibly some 200mm lenses, one will usually need to use a mounting ring on the lens for proper weight distribution). Telephoto and supertelephoto lenses tend to be physically long, resulting in a non-ideal weight distribution. Regardless of weight distribution, it is all <strong><em>above</em></strong> the focal point, rather than below, so there is always a risk of toppling when the photographers hands are removed from the camera. Most ball heads do not support quick release plates that allow adequate adjustment of the center of gravity to ensure it is directly over the ball head, and in most cases that means the center of weight is actually forward of the head.</p>

<p>Even when properly centered, one must ensure the lens is flat to ensure that weight is properly distributed. If one locks a ball head with the lens at a tilt, the center of gravity will shift forward or backward, again creating an imbalance. If this imbalance falls on one of the planes between tripod legs, a strong gust of wind or a bump from the photographer can add just enough additional imbalance to topple the whole setup. For supertelephoto lenses, even when properly centered, the high weight is often more tension than the ball head can handle unless very tightly locked down. If the lens tilts, the momentum of the motion can again cause the whole setup to topple over.</p>

<p>When using a ball head with a telephoto lens, one must ALWAYS be mindful of the orientation and weight distribution. One must also always remember to re-balance the lens and lock it down very tightly, especially on days with even moderate wind, to ensure as much stability as possible when you need to remove your hands from the setup. It is critical that when you intend to lock the setup down and remove your hands, you orient the heaviest part of the lens directly over a single tripod leg, rather than between two legs, to ensure that in the event something does slip, the chances of the whole setup toppling to the ground is lower. This is a lot of things to be mindful of, when one should be focusing on the photography. There is a solution, though.</p>

<p><strong>The Gimbal Head</strong></p>

<p>When you invest in a lens that is thousands or even more than ten thousand dollars, you probably want to minimize risk and ensure that investment is protected at all costs. A specific style of tripod head, the Gimbal-type Head, is explicitly designed to provide risk-free stability, balance, and fluid operation for large lenses mounted on large cameras. There are a number of gimbal-type heads available, from a variety of manufacturers. </p>

<p>The explicit design of a gimbal aims to create a center of gravity that is lower than the primary focal point upon which the camera assembly tilts, and places the point of rotation for panning directly below on an independent axis. When a camera with a long lens is properly mounted, once released the whole setup will automatically drop to it's lowest potential energy, leaving the lens and camera flat and stable even when the photographer's hands are removed. This is in stark contrast to the use of a long lens setup with a ball head, where letting go of the whole setup without first leveling and tightly locking down the ball head will usually result in the lens flopping over and pointing strait down...usually taking everything else with it crashing to the ground.</p>

<p>Gimbal heads usually support a variety of <strong><em>lens plates</em></strong>, usually Arca-Swiss compatible dovetail mounting plates of varying lengths, that are designed to attach to the foot of a lens' tripod ring. Lens plates tend to be longer than the base length of the foot on the tripod ring, allowing the mounted camera to be shifted forward or backward such that it reaches equilibrium. When a lens is attached to the right lens plate, and mounted at equilibrium, no matter how you tilt or rotate the assembly when photographing something (such as a bird in flight), the moment you release your hands the camera will ultimately re-balance itself, lightly rocking in the cradle of the gimbal, center of gravity properly distributed BELOW the focal point. Wind or an accidental bump from the photographer will simply cause the camera to rotate around the panning axis or rock a little in its cradle, rather than imbalance the whole setup and cause it to topple over. This is in stark contrast to a ball head, where the full weight of the camera must be carefully balanced above the focal point.</p>

<p>A gimbal is usually designed with two pieces (although some modular setups offer more): the outer arm with panning mount, and the inner tilt arm which mounts to the lens. Most gimbals support independent panning and tilt operations from two separate joints. High quality gimbals use ball bearings at both the panning and tilt joint for extremely smooth, fluid, free-running operation. Some gimbals have a lock for the tilt joint, which is useful for traveling with the whole camera setup attached to the gimbal and hung over your shoulder, tripod legs extending forward under your arm.</p>

<p>Most gimbals support a vertical arm adjustment for the inner arm, allowing the center of gravity to be adjusted closer to the tilt joint. This is sometimes necessary to achieve proper balance, such that when releasing the camera the system automatically flattens out at lowest potential energy. </p>

<p><strong>Standard vs. Modular Gimbals</strong></p>

<p>Some gimbals, such as the Custom Brackets (CB) and Really Right Stuff (RRS) gimbals are modular, allowing decomposition into fewer parts. Both support operation as a full gimbal, as well as a side-mount single-arm and even center-mount panning head with side-mount flash on the outer arm. Modular gimbals, as they break down to individual parts, tend to be much more compact and are good for travel. Standard gimbals, with the outer and inner arms, are usually not able to be disassembled, and tend to be fairly large and heavier than most modular gimbals. They are good when you intend to set up and stay put for a while, but are not as ideal for hiking around and setting up/tearing down multiple times a day. Standard gimbals, however, tend to be far more stable than modular gimbals, and if you need the most stability possible, a standard gimbal is the only way to go.</p>

<p><strong>Gimbal Brands and Types</strong></p>

<p>There are several major gimbal brands. The most well-known is Wimberley, and their Wimberley Head II is the most popular gimbal overall. Other high-end gimbal manufacturers include Mongoose, Jobu Design, Really Right Stuff, and Custom Brackets. A number of other manufacturers, such as Induro, Opteka, Bogen, etc. High-end gimbals usually sell for about $600, give or take $20-30. Other gimbals can sell for anywhere between $100 and $600, however even the most expensive tend not to offer the kind of quality you find in one of the high-end manufacturers. For example, Induro offers a gimbal that sells for about $580, however it has frequently been reported as offering tacky, rough, gritty movement not becoming of its price.</p>

<p>Among the high-end manufacturers, aside from Wimberley, the Jobu Design Pro2 gimbal and the Mongoose M3.6 side-mount (which supports an optional inner conversion arm to make it a standard gimbal) are the most popular. The Mongoose M3.6 has gained considerable popularity among wildlife and bird photographers for its solid design and easy side-mount use with supertelephoto lenses for maximum stability (using only the outer arm and side-mounting the lens provides the highest level of stability.) The Jobu Pro2 Gimbal is one of the newest designs, built with high quality ball bearings in both joints for very fluid, effortless operation, without sacrificing one iota in terms of stability.</p>

<p><strong>Best Options</strong></p>

<p>Most Gimbal head users will point you in the direction of Wimberley 90% of the time. A lot of that is established loyalty, as Wimberley gimbal heads have been around for a very long time, and have always offered high quality. I believe Jobu and Mongoose these days offer Wimberley a run for the money, particularly the Jobu Pro2 and the Mongoose M3.6 with the additional inner arm option. Both are relatively light weight for a full gimbal, offer impeccable fluidity of operation, and offer some of the best rigidity of any gimbal on the market, rivaling and possibly surpassing that of the vaunted Wimberley. </p>

"What camera companies make their own sensors?","11551","","<p>Is it public knowledge what manufacturers make their own sensors and what import it from others? </p>

<p>I heard somewhere that Sony manufactures Nikon's high end sensors, but don't know about the others. </p>

<p>Which camera manufacturers make their own? Where do the others get theirs from?</p>
","<p>The underlying technology is broadly the same for all sensor makers and is the same technology used to produce other chips (such as CPU's).  Manufacturers tend to be coy about where a chip was made (fabbed) and although a teardown may yield the information it is not guaranteed.  Much of the information in the public domain comes from 'teardowns' or financial disclosures on the sale of fabs by photographic companies.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways for camera makers to go.  Some major manufacturers have their own foundry to make their chips in-house, some design chips and they are made (fabbed) to order, and some just buy in a package designed and fabbed by a third party and don't get their hands dirty with the sensor design at all.</p>

<p>But the whole thing is a big grey area, and it's worth bearing in mind we're working with tolerances on the µm scale, so if a third party is involved then they'll definitely be producing a product to their clients specifications.  I've included a handful of the major players and what I could find out so far.</p>

<p><strong>Canon</strong> state that they <a href=""http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/technologies_features/cmos_sensor.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">produce all their EOS sensors in-house</a> but they have been on quite a large/old process (the biggest drawback of in-house production).  They were rumoured to be opening a new fab at some point in 2014 and it now appears to be online.  In the release they've been very careful to discuss only their EOS sensors, suggesting other types of camera may be using outsourced parts.</p>

<p><strong>Fuji</strong> seem to now be using Sony and Toshiba chips, but have a differently patterned CFA for the EXR branded sensors.  Rumours are they sold their fab to Toshiba.</p>

<p><strong>Nikon</strong> do not have a fab facility (that I'm aware of or could find) so no sensors are produced in-house.  They are known to use sensor packages from Sony, although it is likely that they had a big hand in the development of those chips.  Also they use TSMC/Renesas to directly produce Nikon designed chips.  Nikon seem to be fairly 'promiscuous' and do use other companies too (like Micron/Aptina, and Toshiba in the <a href=""http://www.chipworks.com/about-chipworks/overview/blog/inside-nikon-d5200-dslr-toshiba-found"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">case of the D5200.</a>) so this list is unlikely to be exhaustive and it's not unreasonable to expect that each model (or even each production run) may even have sensors fabbed a different provider.</p>

<p>Producing a list of sensor sources for Nikon bodies would be quite a big task, and if someone <em>has</em> produced one I've not come across it.</p>

<p><strong>Olympus</strong> seem to buy in sensors outright from various sources.</p>

<p><strong>Pentax</strong> had a strategic partnership with Samsung, but seem to use Sony now (and some Kodak in medium format.)</p>

<p><strong>Samsung</strong> produce sensors and are a fairly prolific foundry in their own right, producing sensors for even arch-rivals in the consumer space (including the iPhone).</p>

<p><strong>Sigma</strong> appear to have purchased the 3rd party fab (Dongbu HiTek) that they used previously to produce their Foveon sensors though they are operating it as a separate entity.</p>

<p><strong>Sony</strong> are likely produce their top-end sensors in-house but as a cost cutting measure they have outsourced some production work to <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/01/sony-fujitsu-idUSTOE69000B20101001"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fujitsu in 2010</a> and probably still do.</p>

<p>It just leaves the question: what do you want/think this information would tell you if you had more of it?  Realistically the information is only really useful for specification based willy-waving.</p>

<p>What makes the image is the entire image formation and processing pathway.  After all, an image is the result of a whole system, not merely the sensor.  It's an important part but things like the selection of <a href=""http://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/an12/an1213.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high speed amplifier</a>, A/D converters, and processing in the digital realm all play their small but equally important parts.</p>

<p>Extra: Iliah commented that <a href=""http://image-sensors-world.blogspot.com/p/image-sensor-companies-list.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Image Sensors World</a> contains a good deal of useful information from the sensor production side rather than brands as we see them but if you're <em>really</em> interested then there's lots to find there.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>  </p>

<p>Is it public knowledge what manufacturers make their own sensors and what import it from others?
For some and not others.  </p>

<p>Knowing it is nice to know and fun from an industry-watching perspective, but the results from the system as a whole are more important.  Once you factor in a lens the potential improvement that knowing/using these specs and what they can offer are so small as to not be worth worrying about.</p>

"Why there is more shutter lag when using live-preview as compared to viewfinder?","11537","","<p>I like to use live preview mostly but when I use the viewfinder, the shutter clicks considerably faster. I think is has something to do with the SLR technology, not just settings. Why slow performance in live preview?</p>

<p>EDIT: I am aware of the slower auto-focus in live-preview but even in manual focus mode, there is a considerable difference in operation. Feels like the shutter takes longer to <strong>start taking the photo</strong>.</p>

<p>PS: I've a Nikon D5100.</p>
","<p>There is more shutter lag because the shutter has to close first before opening again to expose the shot. When you turn on live view, the mirror is raised and the shutter is opened, so the image formed by the sensor can be fed constantly to the LCD. When you take a shot in live view, the shutter closes again to 'reset' the sensor before the actual exposure is made.</p>

<p>When shooting with the viewfinder, the process (simplified) is:</p>

<p><strong>Press button -> mirror lifts -> shutter opens -> light hits sensor which registers it -> shutter closes</strong></p>

<p>When shooting with Live View, the process is:</p>

<p><strong>Press button -> shutter closes -> sensor 'resets to 0' -> shutter opens -> light hits sensor -> shutter closes</strong></p>

<p>Essentially, the mirror lifting is a quicker process than the shutter closing and the sensor 'resetting'.</p>

"How to best manage photos with Lightroom?","11535","","<p>I recently started taking RAW photos and purchased Lightroom 3 to manage them. So far I have not found the ideal way to manage them. Here's basically how my workflow goes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Import the RAW files from the camera to a specific import folder.</li>
<li>Edit the RAW files.</li>
<li>Once the pictures look good, convert the files to JPEG and save them to my photo album folder.</li>
<li>Keyword the photos, possibly add comments etc.</li>
<li>Save the original RAW files to external hard drive.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently Lightroom does not know my photo album folder exists and I've used it only to edit the pictures in the import folder. </p>

<p>However, I'd like to use Lightroom also to manage my photo album. But what would be the best way to handle that? Is there a better way than to export the photos to my album and them import the album folder? I assume export does not include the ratings etc if I set them while editing the RAW files?  </p>

<p>Ideally I would of course keep the RAW files in my album, but my laptop has limited hard drive space, so I can't do that. Besides, I like to keep all the album files in JPEG so I can use them easily anywhere without additional exports.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you're fighting Lightroom's natural workflow a bit.  Here's my suggestion, which is pretty close to a ""standard"" workflow for Lightroom:</p>

<ul>
<li>Import your RAW files.  As part of the import, you've got the option to move the files to another location -- that would be your external drive.  Following the import, then, Lightroom knows about your photos, and the location it knows for those RAW files is the external drive.</li>
<li>Keyword tagging and ranking in the Library module.</li>
<li>Edit any photos you wish in the Develop module -- it's ok to swap this step with tagging if you'd rather do it in that order.</li>
<li>Export your photos to your album folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, you can disconnect your external drive and you'll still have the photos in your album.  If you want to do any work with those photos, though, you'll have to have your external drive connected.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever tuning you do to your workflow, you want to make sure that once photos become known to Lightroom, you're using Lightroom to manage moving those photos, if necessary.  This is because Lightroom handles all of its manipulations and metadata as additions to your original photo (your RAW files).  If you change the location of that RAW file in a way that Lightroom isn't aware of, you're going to end up having to help Lightroom find the new location for that file before it can continue.</p>

"What are the differences between a bridge camera and a DSLR?","11510","","<p>What  are the differences between a bridge camera and a DSLR?</p>
","<p>To understand the difference between a bridge camera and a DSLR, it is really necessary to understand the origin of the term ""bridge camera"".  While a DSLR (digital single lens reflex) is a particular type of camera with a very well defined meaning (it uses a single lens which is used for both exposure and viewfinding), the term ""bridge"" simply means that it is bridging the gap between two different types of cameras.</p>

<p>So, knowing that ""bridge"" camera is simply a marketing term, what was it that it was designed to be a bridge from and to?  </p>

<p>Traditionally there were two main types of cameras, your point and shoot cameras, which were designed to be small, simple to use, and basic for an average person to be able to take photographs.  Historically, they typically had a fixed lens, a basic built in flash if any and a simple viewfinder that simply gave you an idea of what the lens would capture when you exposed the image.  If present at all, settings like shutter speed were minimal.  </p>

<p>On the other side, you had interchangeable lens cameras with full ability to adjust (either manually or automatically) settings like shutter speed, aperture, focal length, etc.  These cameras were much more advanced, generally larger and generally more complicated to use, especially outside of using automatic settings.  SLRs are one example of this type of camera.</p>

<p>Early on, the differences were more pronounced, however as cameras advanced, both of these extremes moved more towards the center.  Point and shoot cameras now often do allow basic exposure adjustments to be made and the automatic shooting capability of DSLRs have made them much simpler for a novice to use and get ok results, however some of the advantages and disadvantages have remained.  Generally, point and shoots still are smaller and lighter and DSLRs have far greater versatility and generally better image quality due to larger sensors and better optics.</p>

<p>So, knowing those two extremes, a bridge camera means that it is a camera which specializes on trying to provide the advantages of both DSLRs and point and shoot cameras with as few of the disadvantages as they can.  They are also sometimes referred to as hybrid cameras.  Typically, they are larger than basic point and shoots and have lenses that have adjustable focal length, but they are typically not removable lenses.  They generally use an electronic view finder to avoid the complexity of SLR optics.  They generally have smaller sensors than a DSLR, but often larger than a typical point and shoot, so they split the difference in size and versatility without having all of the cost or complexity of a DSLR, but also with more versatility than a basic point and shoot.</p>

<p>The exact differences will depend on the particular models you are comparing and some high end bridge cameras may actually perform better than cheap DSLRs in some situations, but the general idea is simply that they straddle the gap left between the design goals of a point and shoot and those of a DSLR.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most consistent distinction in terms of what is being bridged is that of the level of control the camera gives the user.  Ultimately, simple cameras tend to have simpler and more limited controls while high end cameras give the user direct control of every aspect of image capture.  Bridge cameras sit in between the extremes of super simple with no control and complete control over every aspect of image creation.</p>

<p>A more recent introduction to the space is mirrorless cameras which could arguably be considered a type of bridge camera, at least on the lower end (though they aren't typically called as such) as well since they feature generally smaller sensors and simplified bodies from those of DSLRs, but include interchangeable lens systems to improve versatility and quality over that of a bridge camera with a permanently installed lens.  I would say that higher end mirrorless cameras could not be considered bridge as they have strong support for full lighting, exposure and lens selection control and are no longer really a bridge between almost no control and full control, but rather provide full control.</p>

<p>So to break down the gamut of cameras, from simplest to most complex, you have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Point and Shoot / Compact - smallest size, most basic adjustments, cheapest, easiest to use</li>
<li>Conventional Bridge/Hybrid - slightly larger, generally more adjustments, but often menu driven, zoom lens, but permanently attached, still very easy to use</li>
<li>Mirrorless - still a small size.  Camera body nearly resembles a point and shoot, however lenses are interchangeable.  More adjustment options available.  Often full adjustment is available, but may still use menus for some settings, more complicated to use as you need to consider lens selection and possibly exposure adjustments</li>
<li>DSLR - large size, generally better image quality, full adjustments directly available on higher end models, most complicated bodies and thus generally most expensive, similar shooting complexity to mirrorless since full consideration of exposure, lens, lighting selections need to be considered</li>
</ul>

<p>That isn't a perfect list as there is cross over depending on how high end a particular model is, but it serves as a general guideline.  Ultimately, when you are considering which camera to buy, you should look at the capabilities of the camera and your needs rather than considering if it is labeled as a ""bridge"" camera.  Look for a camera that can get the shots you want and let you adjust what you want while taking care of the rest for you.</p>

"Is the formula for object image size given focal length, etc. independent of sensor size?","11509","","<p>I am trying to figure out how big an object of, say, 50cm height at 100m distance and 600mm focal length would appear on a camera's sensor. The ubiquitous formula</p>

<pre><code>object size in image = focal length * object size / object distance
</code></pre>

<p>yields</p>

<pre><code>object size in image = 600mm * .5/100 = 3mm
</code></pre>

<p>What I am wondering: Are these 3mm entirely independent of sensor size?</p>

<p>E.g., a specific superzoom model has a 1/2.3"" sensor (= 4.55mm height according to one source) and a maximum zoom quoted to have a ""35mm equivalent focal length of 600mm"". Would the object actually cover 3/4.55 = approx. 66% of this sensor's height = 66% of the image, or does the relation between the sensor size and the ""35mm equivalent"" have to be taken into account somehow?</p>

<p>(My apologies if this has been asked before - I have found many related questions, but not this one.)</p>
","<p>The answer to your question generally is yes. However as you mention, the ratio of how much of the overall image your subject takes up will depend on your sensor size. What you do have to watch out for is that the ""35mm equivalent focal length"" should <strong>not</strong> be used but the actual focal length as quoted on the camera specs - this is usually something in the single digits of millimetres.</p>

<p>The 35mm equivalent is for comparison purposes only because it reflects the equivalent area of 35mm film (or a full-frame digital sensor) - i.e. 36 x 24mm. People tend to be most familiar with the range of focal lengths at this sensor size e.g. 24mm is wide, 50mm is normal, anything about 100mm is telephoto and so on. This is simply the real focal length multiplied by a factor that represents the ratio between the camera's real sensor size and the nominal 35mm sensor size.</p>

"How do I achieve the technique which creates the illusion of busy locations being empty?","11470","","<p>I remember seeing a series of photos where popular tourist locations are shown to be completely empty. I'm assuming it was done by taking a series of photos and then combining them in Photoshop. But what is the name of that technique so that I can research it further? Bonus points if you actually post the required steps within your answer. </p>
","<p>One straightforward way to achieve this effect is to take multiple shots of the same scene and combine them using <a href=""https://petapixel.com/2013/05/29/a-look-at-reducing-noise-in-photographs-using-median-blending/"" rel=""noreferrer"">median blending</a>.  This technique is commonly used for noise reduction, and does it very effectively &mdash; so effectively, in fact, that it can even hide ""noise"" such as random people walking through the scene.</p>

<p>What median blending effectively does is combine multiple shots of the same scene, replacing the color of each pixel (or, rather, each RGB color channel of each pixel) with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"" rel=""noreferrer"">median</a> of the colors of that pixel in each shot &mdash; that is, a color value chosen to be lighter than in 50% of the shots and darker than in the other 50%.</p>

<p>Compared to simple averaging (either by digital stacking, or simply by taking a longer exposure), median blending is a lot more effective at rejecting ""outliers"", i.e. pixel values that happen to lie far from the ""consensus"" value, whether due to noise or due to an obstacle in the frame.  In practical terms, what this means is that properly done median blending doesn't suffer from the faint blurry ""ghosts"" that moving people or other obstacles tend to produce in averaged images or in long exposures.</p>

<p>The main drawback of median blending is that, to guarantee successful obstacle removal, each pixel in the image must be unobscured in over 50% of the shots.  Otherwise, it's possible that the ""true"" unobscured color of some pixels will actually end up getting rejected as an outlier, leading to more or less random fragments of the foreground obstacles showing up in the results.  As such, median blending is poorly suited for very crowded scenes where the requirement of 50% unobscured coverage cannot be reliably met.  (In such cases manual stitching, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/93138"">as suggested by Jahaziel</a>, may be more effective at the cost of extra labor.)</p>

<p>Also, median blending can give poor results if the actual scene you wish to capture contains some moving elements such as waving flags or clouds moving across the sky.  Whereas a long exposure simply causes moving clouds to blur into streaks, median blending will try to color each pixel either ""cloud gray"" or ""sky blue"", depending on which color happens to appear in a majority of the shots, potentially producing weird and ugly results.  Again, it may be possible to fix this by manual masking (e.g. by using a single shot for the sky and only applying median blending to the non-sky parts of the picture).</p>

<p>Also, as with any image stacking technique, you obviously need a static scene and the ability to take multiple shots of it from the exact same viewpoint.  To some extent you can compensate for minor camera shake with digital image alignment, but a good tripod is definitely recommended.</p>

<p>(Unfortunately, I don't personally have any good pictures available to illustrate this technique with.  However, the PetaPixel post I linked to in my first paragraph above does have some, as does <a href=""https://toomanyadapters.com/how-to-remove-people-travel-photos-photoshop/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this tutorial</a> that I found via Google.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3W5pl.jpg"" alt=""Vertical resolution of the Nikon D7000""></p>
","<p><em>Please note that the following is a simplification of how things actually work</em></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>In digital photography, a light pattern is focused by the lens onto the image sensor. The image sensor is made up of millions of tiny light-sensitive sensors whose measurements are combined to form a 2-dimential array of pixels. Each tiny sensor produces a single light intensity measurement. For simplicity, I will look at the 1-dimensional case. (Think of this as a slice that looks at only a single row of pixels).</p>

<p><strong>Sampling:</strong></p>

<p>Our row of tiny sensors, each of which is measuring a single point of light, is performing <strong>sampling</strong> of a <em>continuous signal</em> (the light coming through the lens) to produce a <em>discrete signal</em> (light intensity values at each evenly spaced pixel).</p>

<p><strong>Sampling Theorem:</strong></p>

<p>The minimum sampling rate (i.e., the number of sensors per inch) that produces a signal that still <em>contains all of the original signal’s information</em> is known as the <em>Nyquist rate</em>, which is twice the maximum frequency in the original signal. The top plot in the figure below shows a 1Hz sine wave sampled at the Nyquist rate, which for this sine wave is 2Hz. The resulting discrete signal, shown in red, contains the same information as the discrete signal plotted beneath it, which was sampled at a frequency of 10Hz. While a slight over simplification, it is essentially true that no information is lost when the original sample rate is known, and the highest frequency in the original signal is less than half the sample rate.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mqq4n.png"" alt=""sampling at 2f"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EuuDV.png"" alt=""sampling at 10f""></p>

<p><strong>Effects of under sampling:</strong></p>

<p>If the sample frequency were less than 2 times the maximum frequency of the signal, then the signal is said to be under sampled. In that case, it is not possible to reconstruct the original continuous signal from the discrete one. An illustration of why this is the case can be found in the figure below. There, two sine waves of different frequencies sampled at the same rate produce the same set of discrete points. These two sine waves are called aliases of each other.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXxVo.png"" alt=""Aliases""></p>

<p>All discrete and digital signals have an infinite number of aliases, which correspond to all the sine waves that could produce the discrete signals. While the existence of these aliases may seem to present a problem when reconstructing the original signal, the solution is to ignore all signal content above the maximum frequency of the original signal. This is equivalent to assuming that the sampled points were taken from the lowest possible frequency sinusoid. Trouble arises when aliases overlap, which can happen when a signal is under sampled.</p>

<p><strong>But Photographs Don't Look Like Sinusoidal Waves. How is all this Relevant?</strong></p>

<p>The reason all of this matters for images is that through application of the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fourier Series</a>, any signal of finite length can be represented as a sum of sinusoids. This means that even if a picture has no discernable wave pattern, it can still be represented as a sequence of sinusoids of different frequencies. The highest frequency that can be represented in the image is half the Nyquist rate (sampling frequency).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Meanings of Similar Terms:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nyquist rate</strong> - The lowest possible sampling frequency that can be used while still guaranteeing the possibility of perfect reconstruction of the original continuous signal. </p>

<p><strong>Nyquist frequency</strong> - The highest frequency continuous signal that can be represented by a discreet signal (for a given sampling frequency).</p>

<p>These two terms are two sides of the same coin. The first gives you a bound on sampling rate as a function of max frequency.

"Does long exposure cause hot pixels in photos?","11395","","<p>Today, I was taking some shots of night sky. For each, I had 20 sec exposure. During picture review, I found a red dot which is referred as ""<em>Hot Pixel""</em> according to some people on the Internet. Because I found this red dot with 20 sec exposures (which I took for the first time to capture the night sky) and not with the normal shots, I thought to test if this was a result of long exposure. To test this, I took two shots with lens cap on. One was with 20 sec exposure and another one with 1 sec exposure.  I found the red dot again with 20 sec exposure but none with 1 sec exposure.</p>

<p>Additional info: Camera : Canon 600D, ISO : 200 - 800, White Balance : Tungsten, Auto and Fluorescent.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TcgrT.jpg"" alt=""Hot pixel with long exposure (20 sec)""></p>

<p>My question is, does this red dot/hot pixel is a result of long exposure or something else (sensor processing etc)?</p>

<p>Also, how to reduce or remove this effect as it seems very annoying for the astro-photography (initially, I got confused with it as a star with red shift)? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p><strong>Yes. This is a hot pixel.</strong></p>

<p>Basically, there is something wrong with one pixel. It can be more sensitive than others or captures some loose electrons in the sensor. In either case, the charge goes up faster than it should and while 1s is not enough, 20s is sufficient for it to accumulate a noticeable charge. In your particular case, the pixel happens to fall behind a red color-filter (that's a 1 in 4 chance), so it appears red but hot pixels (technically photosites) can cause the appearance of red, green or blue dots.</p>

<p>The camera can be calibrated to take into account such anomalies and usually is. It will then apply compensation for it. On some models it is possible to do it yourself using reference images but it is normally done by a service technician. If you do not have a local service center (for Canon in your case), then you have to call and get a reference number. Your send you camera there and get it back a few weeks later without the problem hopefully (and without a new problem as it sometimes happens unfortunately).</p>

<p>Is there a product I've missed, that might be found on the likes of eBay; or would I be better off getting them scanned at my local friendly photolab?</p>
","<p>Well, I've searched for this for a good long while. It took some real search foo, but I eventually found the terms that seem to produce a few god results: <em>APS Film Magnetic Strip Reader</em>.</p>

<p>It seems there is only one product that can be found that can read the magnetic strip on APS film that contains the EXIF metadata. Its the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000059Z4M"">Nikon Coolscan IV APS Film Adapter</a>, a discontinued product that does not seem to be available from any commercial storefront on the internet. I did a <a href=""http://photography.shop.ebay.com/Film-Slide-Scanners-/15223/i.html?_nkw=nikon+coolscan"">search on eBay for Nikon Coolscan</a>, and there seem to be quite a few things, including APS specific gear. The APS Film Adapter was not listed when I did my searches, however its eBay, so you never know. </p>

<p>From what I can tell, the Coolscan scanners and the film adapters seem to be pretty expensive...as in, the $2000-$3000 range. Not exactly consumer-level gear. Most of the information I was able to find (which included the links from @nik, as well as several other similar sites and forums) seemed to indicate that the advanced features of APS film never really took off, and the magnetic strip that contained the metadata was never really effectively used. Seems like that is partly due to the downfall of APS as a film format (couldn't tell you why it really failed, never knew much about it.) </p>

<p>There was one other product that I found, the <a href=""http://www.photokina-show.com/0410/fujifilm/printer/fujifilmfrontierminilab/"">Fuji Frontier Minilab</a>, that seems to be able to scan APS film. A lot of information seems to indicate that it can read the magnetic strip and extract the EXIF data from it, however I couldn't find anything that actually confirmed that. Sadly, it is a commercial product, rather huge, and probably far outside of any individuals price range. You might try taking your APS film to a shop that uses the Fuji Minilab, and see if their scans include the EXIF metadata. Beyond that, I couldn't find anything else relating to scanning APS film and including the EXIF in the resulting digital images.</p>

","<p>I'm not familiar with the D3200 but I do know that DSLRs have an ""AF assist"" for low light conditions.</p>

<p>This shines a light (sometimes green, orange or white) from the body to illuminate the subject for more accurate AF because phase detection performance starts to degrade low than about 6LV (depending on model).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EqUM.png"" alt=""D3200 AF assist""></p>

<p>However, in live view, it's possible it is boosting the sensor data (similar to increasing the ISO) and it might be that it performs better than the AF assist. Quite a few of sensors now have phase detection intergrated into the sensor but generally live view (and compact cameras) use contrast detection, while DSLRs use phase (also, generally considered better).</p>

<p>Check that the AF-assist is on and see what happens. You might have found out that live view has more powerful AF in low light conditions.</p>

"What focal length gives a ""normal"" field-of-view on APS-C cameras?","11297","","<p>I wish to purchase a ""standard angle-of-view"" prime lens for my Canon Rebel, which has an APS-C sized sensor. Various articles note that the popular ""nifty 50mm"" lenses are a little too much of a telephoto on these cameras to work well as an all-purpose walk-about prime. </p>

<p>What focal length should I look for that would have a ""standard"" angle of view similar to the unaided eye?</p>
","<p>Using the 1.6 crop factor certainly works, but it might be interesting to work it out from first principles, too.  The ""normal"" focal length is generally considered to be close to the diagonal of the image area (sensor, film, whatever).  For 35mm film and ""full frame"" digital, this is about 43mm - 50mm is the closest common focal length for reasons that are interesting but probably not relevant here apart from indicating there's some range for variation.</p>

<p>So, another way to determine which lens is to find the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SensorSizes.svg"" rel=""noreferrer"">dimensions of Canon's APS-C</a>, and apply some Pythagoras:</p>

<pre><code>sqrt( 22.2^2 + 14.8^2 ) = 26.68
</code></pre>

<p>So for a Canon APS-C, you might consider anything from 24mm* up to about 35mm as a good choice for a ""normal"" lens.  If you wanted to get as close as possible to a 50mm, then the 30mm mentioned is likely a good choice, which we can see by comparing the ratio of 50mm to the theoretical 43mm:</p>

<pre><code>50mm / 43mm = 1.16
35mm / 26.7 = 1.31
30mm / 26.7 = 1.12 – closest to 50mm
28mm / 26.7 = 1.04 – closest to theoretical normal
24mm / 26.7 = 0.89

<p>Are they very much more difficult/expensive to make?  I'd dearly love to get into wide-angle photography, so how can I get the shots I want without having to pay such a large amount of money?</p>
","<p>Firstly I wouldn't let the recommended retail price dissuade you — the 10-22 can be snapped up for <strong>£570</strong> online. To answer the second part of your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how can I get the shots I want without having to pay such a large amount of money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would look at the non-Canon brand wideangles, such as the <em>Tamron 10-22 f/3.4-4.5</em> for <strong>£337</strong> or the <em>Sigma 10-20 f/3.5</em> for <strong>£372</strong>. Also consider the used market - wideangle photography doesn't have to be as expensive as you think!</p>

<p>But yes, in general <strong>wide angle lenses are expensive</strong>.</p>

<p>This is partially due to the design, and expectations placed on the lens. Any lens with a <strong>focal length</strong> shorter than the <strong>flange-focal distance</strong> (the distance from the back of the lens to the sensor, also called the registration distance, I think it's 42mm on a Canon) has to employ a <strong>retrofocal design</strong>, which basically means it's a normal lens with a <strong>reverse telephoto stuck on the back</strong>. The extra elements required adds to the cost and makes the lens more difficult to design and manufacture. </p>

<p>Compare the design of the EF 14mm f/2.8 (top) to the EF 50mm f/1.8 (middle) and EF 100mm f/2.0 (bottom)</p>

EF 100mm f/2.0 </p>

<p><sub><em>images copyright Canon inc.</em></sub></p>

<p>The 14mm is by far the most complicated, and you can clearly see the retrofocal elements at the rear. The 50mm is a simple symmetric design with only 6 elements. For completeness I've added the 100mm, as it's a <strong>telephoto</strong> design which allows the <strong>lens assembly to be shorter than the focal length</strong> (it's only 73mm long) for mainly practical reasons/cost. The reversed telephoto section of the 14mm does the opposite and makes the lens <strong>longer than it's focal length</strong> which makes room for the <strong>mirror</strong> in an SLR see this question for more on telephotos: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/3618/is-there-construction-agnostic-term-for-a-lens-with-a-long-focal-length"">Is there construction-agnostic term for a lens with a long focal length?</a></p>

<p>The other part of the problem stems from what you're asking the lens to do — bend light from a huge number of different angles and focus it on a single rectangular plane. Any lens at the edge of the performance envelope, be it wide, long, aperture will be expensive. As different wavelengths of light bend at different rates you have to work very hard to avoid <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> where the constituent colours of light split up and fail to align on the sensor. Combating this requires <strong>aspherical elements</strong> (coloured green in the 14mm diagram above. It's easy to grind glass into a sphere (simply spin it in front of a polisher) but to grind parabolic and other aspherical profiles is much harder (and therefore expensive). Wide angle designs also employs ultra-low dispersion glass for sharpness and contrast.</p>

<p>Telephotos can be just as expensive, but for different reasons. Light doesn't have to bend as far, so the design is simpler but this time the pure size of the glass elements required for a decent aperture (remember that f/2.8 means the [apparent] size of the aperture must be <strong>about one third of the focal length</strong>, which becomes really quite large once you go past 200mm or so) makes the elements expensive to produce (at this size dispersion &amp; scattering is a big problem so UD glass and fluorite have to be used) and creates engineering difficulties in moving them around (motors and lens barrels have to be larger and stronger).</p>

<p>50mm is the sweet spot of lens design for 35mm SLRs, wide enough that the size of the elements required to maintain a wide aperture are still relatively small, but not so wide a retrofocal design is needed. This is why 50mm primes are such good value. </p>

<p>What if is a white skin model? an Asian skin model? Dark skin model?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>White clothes are a great go-to color for a bright colored background. This will put skintones into a color saturation middle-ground. With dark/black clothes our brains sort-of disqualify it from our impression of saturation. So that would leave the person's face and hair looking dull and neutral in contrast, which in turn puts too much emphasis on the background, making it distracting. </p>

<p>White also has a ""fresh"" or ""new"" feel, excellent themes for graduation. </p>

<p>It looks like you have a very light blue background. Keep in mind that lighting from behind (such as a hairlight or rimming) may blend edges into the background, losing definition. Unless you can keep enough light off the background to get it around mid-toned, then adding a bright rim would be a positive thing. </p>

"Does my crop sensor camera actually turn my lenses into a longer focal length?","11237","","<p>So, I mount a 200mm lens on my Canon 450D. It effectively becomes a 320mm lens. Is this the equivalent of 320mm on a full frame camera? That is, from what I've figured out I get an equivalent field of view but nothing I've read is indicating that I get the magnification to go along with it.</p>

<p>So as my question says in the title, does my crop sensor camera <em>really</em> turn my lens into a longer one (in terms of magnification), or does it just look like it based on the reduced field of view I get?</p>
","<p>The lens does not actually <em>turn</em> into a different focal length, since that's a real, physical property of the optics that can't be changed without more optics. So from that point of view, the answer is a definitive <em>no</em>.</p>

<p>However, when you get to the question of <em>is it effectively the same in terms of magnification</em>, the answer is ""pretty much, given some assumptions.""</p>

<p>A key assumption is that you're printing at the same size. That means: you're <em>increasing the magnification</em> of the image from the smaller sensor. <strong>If you print at sizes different by the same ratio of the crop factor, you get exactly the same result as if you just took a full-frame photo, printed large, and then cropped out the middle.</strong></p>

<p>So, if you print your full-frame picture at 12×9"", and print your crop-factor picture at 7.5×5.6"" (for Canon; 8×6"" for others, or 6×4.5"", or whatever), and then chop down the full-frame print to match, they'll be roughly the same.</p>

<p>""Roughly"" comes in because, of course, the actual sensors won't be equivalent in image quality. (The crop-factor print may have larger resolution, but from denser photosites, depending on the technology generation used in each camera.)</p>

<p>Blowing up that cropped image — either from the full-frame cropped print, or from the cropped sensor — has <strong>two effects which are very like changing the focal length</strong>. And these two things are the most visible effects of changing focal length — <strong>field of view</strong>, as you've noted; and <strong>depth of field</strong>, <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10079/can-a-smaller-sensors-crop-factor-be-used-to-calculate-the-exact-increase-in-d/10121#10121"">which changes exactly as if you'd adjusted the f-stop by the amount of the crop</a>.</p>

<p>If you've ever used a point and shoot camera with ""digital zoom"", that's what's actually going on. It's cropping the photo and then expanding it. <strong>From a practical point of view, zoom is indistinguishable from cropping.</strong> But of course, that raises the spectre of decreased image quality — we all know that digital zoom can be awful. The answer is simply that sensor technology is really very good, and amazing, excellent results can be produced at even large print sizes even with a 1.5 or 1.6× crop — but if you do want to go larger with your prints, eventually you need <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/11291/why-invest-in-high-end-large-and-medium-format-digital-cameras"">a larger sensor</a>. And, equivalently, if you want to zoom in more, you can do that with more cropping, but eventually, you need actual higher-focal-length glass.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn't address macro shooting. I don't really do any of that, so I'll let someone else handle that aspect of the question — which I think is well-addressed here: <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8932/macro-shots-and-crop-factor-bodies"">Does a camera&#39;s crop factor apply to the magnification of macro shots?</a></p>

"How to enable Canon AF with teleconverter?","11231","","<p>Canon DSLR bodies prevent poor auto-focus performance by disabling it completely when the lens reports maximum aperture at chosen focal length smaller than f/5.6. This implies that some lenses will not auto-focus on a teleconverter, e.g. the popular Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6L, or any f/4 lens on a TC stronger than 1.4×.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/17056/4390"">an answer</a>, Matt Grum mentions that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's a well known trick whereby you tape the pins on your teleconverter to prevent it from reporting the true aperture of the lens+converter combo so that AF remains enabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which pins have to be taped? Are there any other consequences than just enabling AF, e.g. how will that taping affect focal length stored in EXIF info?</p>

<p>If there are any other workarounds, e.g. using alternative firmware, those options would be welcome too. Let's skip the obvious option of moving closer and removing TC :)</p>
","<p>Basically tape the last(left) <strong>three pins of the converter</strong>. EXIF distance data will likely be lost for most lenses.</p>

<p>You will find your answer at this link: <a href=""http://www.fredmiranda.com/TipsPage/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fred Miranda Tips Page</a></p>

<p>As quoted from the site: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just place a small transparent piece of tape on the last 3 pins of the converter. The tape should be placed on the left hand side of the converter when looking at it from the lens connection side. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also have a picture example of doing so if you need that guidance. </p>

<p>As far as other consequences to taping the pins, I found a bit of information and some anecdotal data for you as well from <a href=""http://photography-on-the.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-23667.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should be aware that the EXIF data will not be correct with regards to focal length, however.</p>
  
  <p>Another thing to be aware of is that these three pins obviously do a little more than that with some lenses. Whilst my 100-400 is fine with a taped 1.4x my 70-200/f4 didn't like it at all. It hunted like crazy and hardly ever achieved focus lock. Without the tape it was as quick to focus (as far as I could tell) as without the teleconverter. The solution was to put the tape on the corresponding contacts on the back of the 100-400, now both lenses work just fine with the teleconverter. -chris maddock</p>

"What is ""ISO"" on a digital camera?","11213","","<p>What is ""ISO"" in general, and how is the scale defined?</p>

<p>How does the ISO scale for film speed differ from ISO sensitivity as used in digital cameras?</p>

<p>Is lower ISO always better?</p>
","<p>In photography, ISO generally refers to a measure of ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed"">Film Speed</a>"", which I use including reference to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed#Digital_camera_ISO_speed_and_exposure_index"">digital sensor sensitivity</a>.</p>

<p>In short, the actual letters ISO are a name for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization"">International Organization for Standardization</a> (not, officially, an acronym -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization#Name_and_abbreviation"">more information here</a>), and in photography it refers to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed#The_ISO_12232:2006_standard"">the ISO 12232:2006 standard</a> and other related standards: ISO 12232:1998, ISO 5800:1987, ISO 6:1993 and ISO 2240:2003.  (Links on the Film Speed page.)  Film historically has also used the  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed#Historic_systems"">ASA and DIN standards</a>, the former using the same numbering system, and DIN using an entirely different scale.</p>

<p>The standards for film and digital are technically different (in ways I haven't investigated closely enough to report fully on), but generally they're similar enough that for practical purposes, they're essentially the same (notwithstanding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(photography)#Reciprocity_failure"">Reciprocity Failure</a>, which many films are quite prone to, though digital generally is not).  So if you measure an exposure with your digital camera, you could use that exposure with a film of the same rating as the ISO setting you used in the digital camera, and expect to get a similar exposure (unless the shutter speed is long or short enough for Reciprocity Failure to kick in for the film) (also assuming similar equipment otherwise -- no differences in filters, etc.).</p>

<p>In both digital and film, a higher number indicates greater sensitivity.  A number twice as high is twice as sensitive (e.g. 200 is twice as sensitive as 100, 400 twice as sensitive as 200, etc.).  So, when shooting in relatively low light, and wanting a relatively-fast (e.g. fast enough to stop motion) shutter speed, a higher sensitivity rating will be essential (so no, lower is not always better!)</p>

<p>In digital cameras (and similarly but differently in film), higher ISO ratings tend to create <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise"">noise</a> (the related effect in film is increased <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_grain"">graininess</a>).  So, while it's not always <em>better</em> (that depends on what you're going for), lower ISO ratings are always (or at least almost always) lower in noise, which may be desirable.  (In the case of low light photography where shutter speed is not a concern, long exposures mixed with lower ISO ratings will create a ""better"" image -- though it's conceivable that some may like the effects of the noise; certainly there's appeal at times to film grain.) </p>

<p>As for how the scale is defined, it is based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed#Measurements_and_calculations"">measurements of an image produced based on a certain scenario of illumination</a>.  The details are complex, so I'll leave the details as an exercise for the reader.  A lay summary is that (for digital) it's a measure of how quickly the digital sensor becomes ""saturated"" with light.  (For film, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed#Determining_film_speed"">process</a> is related but different.)</p>

<p>In summary: higher ISO is more sensitive but noisier (but not necessarily worse), digital and film rated for the same ISO (or ASA for the film) will have similar sensitivity, and the scale is based on how quickly an image will become ""saturated"" given a certain amount of illumination. </p>

<hr>

<p>NOTE: I'm gearing up to do some experimentation related to the controversial answer from Matt Grum.  <em>Hopefully</em>, my results will create a nice clear noise-free answer to the important point he brings up: that a high-ISO image with a low amount of light will be less noisy than a low-ISO image <em>with the same amount of light getting to the sensor</em>, which is later amplified in post-processing.  More to come, hopefully in... EDIT: Well, I've failed to make this happen for a while now.  I may still do it at some point.  In the mean time, I'll also point to <a href=""http://shootintheshot.joshsilfen.com/2010/05/13/canon-hd-dslr-native-iso/"">this article</a> that talks about comparisons of native versus non-native ISO values, and amounts of noise in them, which, while the article doesn't exactly say so, I think is probably directly related to exactly this question.</p>

"Exposure compensation or ISO sensitivity?","11210","","<p>If ambient light isn't enough and I don't have a tripod with me for long exposure, which one should I prefer to increase the brightness of my photo? </p>

<p>I know high ISO comes with noise. <strong>Is there any side effect of high exposure compensation?</strong></p>

<p>What I do is open full aperture &amp; increase exposure till 1/10s. If not enough, increase ISO till about 300. After that noise is noticeable so I resort to exposure compensation, all the way up to +5. Then back to ISO. Last option is flash, if possible. Is this the best  practise? <strong>Should I increase Exposure compensation before increasing ISO?</strong> </p>
","<p>You misunderstand how exposure compensation works.</p>

<p>Exposure compensation is not an actual physical thing the camera uses to control light - there are only 3 real things that control the amount of light: Aperture, Shutter speed and ISO.</p>

<p>Exposure compensation is a way to tell the camera in one of the auto/semi-auto modes you want to override the light meter reading.</p>

<p>In A/Av mode the exposure compensation changes the shutter speed (and maybe ISO, depending on how you set things) in S/Tv mode it changes aperture (and again, maybe ISO) in P mode it can change any of the 3.</p>

<p>If you are in full manual mode exposure compensation does nothing because it has no auto setting to adjust.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question, if you are already shooting wide open and at the slowest acceptable shutter speed all you can do is increase ISO or add flash, the exposure compensation feature has nothing to adjust to help you here.</p>

<p>BTW, don't be afraid of ISO, the modern camera can handle ISO values much higher than reading photography sites will lead you to believe and even when you push it too far there are excellent noise reduction tools out there. </p>

"What are my options for an FX wide-angle prime to suit the D800's successor?","11207","","<p>I have a D700 which I'm not planning to replace at this point in Nikon's product cycle.   I'll porbably buy the D800's successor.   Not because I don't like the D800 (especially its usability improvements around focus mode switching and Live View, which don't seem to have attracted much attention) but because I can't justify the cost when there are too few things the D800 does that the D700 doesn't.</p>

<p>Anyway, although I'm keeping the D700 for now, I'm planning to buy a wide-angle prime so that I end up with this in my bag:  D700, SB-800, 105mm micro, 50mm, wide-angle.</p>

<p>I need to choose a wide-angle lens.   The 14-24 is a great lens, but too big for me to routinely carry it.   So I'm going to buy a wide-angle prime.   However, I don't want to buy a prime now that turns out to be disappointing on the replacement body I eventually buy.</p>

<p>As for focal length, the 35mm is a lens I could like but it's too close to the 50mm for me to seriously consider buying it.   Hence I'm looking at the 20mm - 28mm focal length range.   Which Nikon primes have sufficient micro-contrast to work well with bodies with a finer pixel pitch at full frame (I'm going to assume for the sake of the discussion that that is what the D800 successor will be like: FX, high resolution)?</p>

<p>I'm going to assume that the 24mm f/1.4 is going to be among the suggestions, and in fact Nikon points it out in the technical guide for the D800 as being suitable for use with the D800E.   It's heavy and expensive so I worry that in practice I'd leave it behind with the 14-24.   So I'm interested in my other likely options.   </p>

<p>Budget is important for recommending the right choice.   But I'm pretty flexible for a reason: new lenses will be launched between now and the launch of the D800's successor.  So maybe the right approach is to buy something less expensive now and upgrade later to some not-yet-existing lens. The principle I'm going to operate on is that I'm OK with buying a lens now, that's actually not suitable for the D800's successor at up to €400.   I'd just sell if that seems like the right thing to do, and not worry about losing some of its value on the re-sale.   On the other hand, if I'm going to spend more than €500 I don't want to plan to replace the lens.</p>

<p>My planned uses are principally travel photography, interior shots, architecture, some environmental portraits.</p>

<p>What do you say?</p>
","<p>My suggestion would be that you hold off on a wide prime if you're buying it for the future. Any of them are okay if you're looking to match them with the D700's sensor, but the D800 (and, one would assume, its successor models) has about the same pixel density on the sensor as the D7000, and the Nikkor full-frame wide angles are showing their age on that model (and not well, either). They're not particularly sharp at the corners, and display significant vignetting already -- and that doesn't account for performance at the edges of a full-frame sensor. If you can, try to get some feedback from people who've tried them on a D3X, but I wouldn't expect any rave reviews.</p>

<p>Since Nikon has decided to step into the miniature medium format world -- using a sensor that's verging on the very edge of even theoretically perfect lens performance -- and their stable of full-frame wide-angle primes is getting a little long in the tooth, I'd expect to see some newer design trickling in over the next few years. So <strong>buy for the short term</strong> rather than for the future if you're waiting for a successor to a model that isn't actually shipping yet -- something that might show its age on a D800 could be the best thing that ever happened to your D700. And get the focal length you need rather than worrying about which one is ""best"" -- the best lens is the one that lets you take the pictures you want to take, not the one with the best specs, build quality or handling.</p>

"What is bulb ramping?","11159","","<p>What does the term <em>bulb ramping</em> refer to and what does it bring the world of time-lapse photography?</p>

<p>It seems you need a specific type of intervalometer for bulb ramping. How do these differ from the average intervalometer?</p>
","<p>Bulb ramping, or bramping, is a means of automatically adjusting exposure settings to maintain a specific exposure value (EV) throughout the duration of a time-lapse sequence. Bulb ramping intervalometers can be simple and cheap, or complex and expensive, depending on the results they can provide. Cheaper ones, and many DIY projects that you can follow to build your own, tend to produce fairly apparent jumps when exposure settings are changed, resulting in less-than-ideal results when a time-lapse sequence is stitched together into a video. More expensive intervalometers that offer bulb ramping capabilities tend to produce much finer adjustments over more frames, greatly reducing or eliminating visible jumps in exposure value in the final video.</p>

<p>Its somewhat possible to achieve bulb ramping with a normal intervolometer and automatic settings in a camera body. Things like auto ISO and a priority mode will usually achieve some degree of bulb ramping...but the results are often unpredictable. Using automatic and priority modes sometimes limit your options as well...such as only outputting JPEG images, or being limited in how much ""ramping"" can occur, etc. If you want the best results, buying or building a high quality bramper that supports fine adjustments over the duration of a time-lapse sequence will be necessary.</p>

","<p>If using GIMP (and probably any other image editing software), then you could use the selection tool and set the size of the crop frame to a required size and aspect ratio. This way, you can see the relative sensor size superimposed on your image while letting you panning it around.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Unfortunately, using GIMP, you cannot simply set the <em>ratio</em> of the size if the selection box to match the crop factor (or focal lengths ratio). As @Stan Rogers commented, you'll have to set the size in pixels based on the simple focal length ratio. Then you can move the selection box to the desired location and if you like, add a rectangular frame to the image itself, so you can compare several selection sizes.</p>

"Why does Canon and Nikon limit or disable autofocus beyond certain f-numbers?","11070","","<p>One thing that I've noticed with Canon DSLR camera is they will disable or limit autofocus when the lens' maximum aperture is narrower than certain values, which are specified in <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/16399/what-are-the-aperture-limits-for-autofocus-on-canon-dslr-cameras/16400#16400"">my answer</a> to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/16399/what-are-the-aperture-limits-for-autofocus-on-canon-dslr-cameras"">What apertures are required to enable autofocus, including cross-type or high-precision focusing, on Canon DSLR cameras?</a>  Note that Nikon cameras are also typically limited to f/5.6 except for models featuring the latest revision of the Multi-CAM 3500 AF system as in the D4 and D800.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, Olympus and Pentax do not have these limitations, even if autofocus may be slow or unreliable beyond f/5.6. (Sony/Minolta requires at least f/6.3, with one exception for a 500mm f/8 autofocus mirror lens, and the Alpha 850 and 900 have a center AF point with high precision at f/2.8.) For example, on Pentax, 9 of the 11 points are cross-type and remain so at all apertures. The Pentax AF system has been reported to work at f/8 and beyond, though extremely slowly.  Olympus Four Thirds cameras will continue to attempt to focus below f/5.6 as well.   Why do Canon and Nikon choose to limit AF functionality instead of attempting to focus with reduced performance beyond the above cutoffs?</p>
","<p>The auto focus systems are not capable of using the highest precision cross type focusing points if you do not use a large aperture lens. They aren't artificially limiting the precision, they are simply working within the constraints of the maximum aperture.</p>

<p><strong>Canon puts these limits in to ensure reliable AF</strong>. If you don't believe that theory, add a piece of tape between your teleconverter and lens, on the top three left pins. This will trick your body into thinking that you don't have a teleconverter attached, and your lens is simply a 300/4.0 or whatever you have.</p>

<p>Furthermore, only the Canon 1-series cameras are capable of AF with a f/8 lens, albeit at the center point only. Usually this setup comes from combining a long lens with a extender. (Note: more recently the Canon 5D Mark III, 7D with firmware v.2.0 or later, and 7D Mark II can AF with the center point up to f/8. The Canon 5D Mark IV and 1D X Mark II can AF with multiple AF points with an f/8 lens. The Canon 1D X requires later firmware to AF an f/8 lens with the center point. As originally shipped it would only AF with f/5.6 and wider lenses.)</p>

<p>This really comes down to a issue of <strong>user experience</strong>. Sure, they could include ISO 204800 or 409600, but the quality would not make anyone happy. They are trying to keep the majority of users satisfied with what the camera can do, and most consumers are satisfied if AF doesn't hunt endlessly.</p>

</ul>

<p>So, does <em>crisp</em> have a specific meaning in photography, or is it just a loose synonym for <em>sharp</em>?</p>
","<p>Sharpness and ""crispness"" are related, but they're not identical (at least in the language of critique).</p>

<p>Sharpness is an evaluation of how well the detail in the image is recorded; crispness is about how well that detail is conveyed to the viewer. A crisp image will be sharp (mostly, that is, where sharpness counts), but it will also necessarily have a degree of contrast (at several levels) that allows the viewer to notice that it's sharp.</p>

<p>Straight out of camera, the difference between merely sharp and crisp could come down to a simple difference in lighting, with all other factors (lens, overall exposure, aperture, focus distance, focus accuracy, etc.) being the same — a picture taken under very flat light will not have nearly the same ability to convey apparent detail, texture and shape as an otherwise identical picture taken under slightly contrastier lighting conditions. Put both pictures on screen at a ridiculously high magnification, though, and you will see that the same size of details are recorded in both.</p>

<p>A beginning or casual photographer is at a distinct disadvantage here. Their camera will produce absolutely stunning images sometimes, and, well, duds at other times, using the exact same settings (where, admittedly, ""the exact same settings"" may simply mean ""it was on 'P' for 'Professional'"" or some other automated setting, with the same JPEG/rendering preset selected). Without some appreciation of lighting (both quality and direction) and some basic understanding of how to finish the picture (whether that means post-processing or simply selecting a different picture style on the camera, one that's more appropriate to the conditions), the photographer is at the mercy of circumstance, and the camera takes both the credit for successes and the blame for failures.</p>

<p>Provided that the camera and lens (and tripod, where applicable) are capable of rendering sharp images, the photographer can create crisp images. Or not.</p>

"How secure is Flickr's ""disable download of original image"" feature?","11064","","<p>In the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/account/?tab=privacy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flickr privacy settings page</a> there's a setting entitled ""Who can access your original image files?"". If I set this to anything other than ""Anyone"" (e.g. ""Only you"" or ""Your contacts""), <strong>is it still possible for an unauthorised user to access the <em>original</em> image without someone giving them the URL for it?</strong> (Assume that my original photo is larger than 1024px, so there's an Original version distinct from the Large version. Also assume it's not <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#88"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Creative Commons licensed</a>.)</p>

<p>I'm well aware that once an image has appeared in their browser, a determined user can easily download it regardless of any disincentives (e.g. JavaScript blockers) the browser tries to put in their way. However, I believe the following are correct:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An unauthorised user will just see an error page if they try to view the Original Size page on Flickr (e.g. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bitrot/6073914523/sizes/o/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Although the URL of that page is easily guessable (just add <code>sizes/o/</code> to the end of the regular photo page URL), the URL of the <em>actual original image file</em> has a random component and cannot easily be guessed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157624743789041/72157624744434885/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plenty</a> of <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157627349737482/72157627225542745/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">people</a> on Flickr and elsewhere saying the disable download setting is useless, but I haven't seen any proof.

<p><em>Some context: I should point out I'm not looking to steal photos, I'm trying to understand how safe mine are, specifically with regard to <a href=""http://www.petapixel.com/2011/08/31/flickrs-geofence-feature-not-as-secure-as-one-might-think/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this geofences loophole</a> that was reported today.</em></p>
","<p>I did some investigation on my own, using my own flickr account and a non-logged in browser.</p>

<p>Here's <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kanook/6044833128/sizes/l/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the All Sizes page for one of my photos</a>. </p>

<p>Prior to me changing the ""Who can access your original image files?"" setting in Privacy &amp; Permissions, a generic Internet user could see the ""<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kanook/6044833128/sizes/o/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Original</a>"" link in addition to the other sizes. That page had an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag that linked to <a href=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_3b8eac89d7_o.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this url</a>. The ""All Sizes"" page also had a link that said <a href=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_3b8eac89d7_o_d.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Download the Original size of this photo</a>. (If you check the URLS, note that there's a <code>_d</code> suffix on the file name; Flickr will see this and trigger the HTTP header that tells the browser to download instead of display the image). </p>

<p>For comparison, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kanook/6044833128/sizes/l/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's the Large size page</a> and the <a href=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_cc02cf41e3_b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">corresponding image URL</a>.</p>

<p>Then I changed the privacy setting, cleared the cache on my non-logged-in browser, and recheceked the links. Here's what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kanook/6044833128/sizes/o/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link to the original size page</a> now redirects to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kanook/6044833128/sizes/l/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the large size page</a>. That's reasonable.</li>
<li>The All Sizes page didn't have the Original size links any more, as expected.</li>
<li>I was still able to <a href=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_3b8eac89d7_o.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">download the original size image</a>

<ul>
<li>This is a bit surprising. It means that, while there's access restrictions on the pages containing the images, <em>theres no security on the images themselves</em>. </li>
<li>As a web developer I can understand why they probably did this. The images are large and static and probably served via a content delivery network. It's faster/more efficient to not check permissions for image files; you can simply host them on a ""dumb"" web server that way. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, once the URL for the original file is known, <em>there's no way to stop someone from downloading the original version of the file</em> (short of deleting it entirely... and <em>that</em> may not even work. I didn't try).</p>

<p>One last issue: how guessable are the original file URLS? Here they are side-by-side:</p>

<pre><code>Large:    http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_cc02cf41e3_b.jpg
Original: http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_3b8eac89d7_o.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>So, the suffix (<code>_b</code> or <code>_o</code>) determines the size, but there's also another element in the filename that varies depending on the size. You can't just change the suffix to flip sizes. Here's the <a href=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6044833128_cc02cf41e3_b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">URL for the Large version with the suffix switched</a> to <code>_o</code>; it doesn't work.</p>

<p>If I was Flickr, I'd make sure that that middle element was completely random per photo size, and hence unguessable except by brute force attack. It's 40 bits long, so there's a <em>lot</em> (2^40, ~1 Trillion) of possible options. It's very unlikely anyone would bother to brute-force that segment just to get the original size version of a file... when they already have the <em>large</em> version.</p>

<p>So, as long as you've turned off the ""Original file download"" feature <em>and you don't share the URLs of the original images</em>, I'd say that the Flickr feature is pretty secure. If it breaks, it's pretty much your own fault.</p>

"What's the use of a very fast shutter speed, faster than 1/4000?","11043","","<p>I am planning to buy a new DSLR and am comparing two models. One of them has a fastest shutter speed of ¹⁄₄₀₀₀th of a second while other has a limit of ¹⁄₈₀₀₀th.</p>

<p>I know that a fast shutter speed will help me to capture fast moving objects, but I want to know in which scenarios I would be using a shutter speed which is faster than ¹⁄₈₀₀₀th of a second.</p>
","<p>In most scenarios the extra stop between 1/4000 and 1/8000 second will make very little difference in terms of freezing motion. 1/4000 will freeze all but the fastest objects you are likely to encounter, and even 1/2000 will freeze world class human athletes and most animals at typical shooting distances.</p>

<p>Where the extra stop will come in handy is when you are in very bright light, have already adjusted your camera to the lowest available ISO and want to use a wider aperture to reduce the <em>Depth of Field (DoF)</em>. If you find yourself shooting in such situations often, you will probably wind up eventually acquiring and learning to use <em>Neutral Density (ND) Filters</em>. These reduce the amount of light entering the camera without adding a color cast (hopefully) in order to enable slower shutter speeds and/or wider apertures when desired. Once you start shooting with <em>ND</em> filters the difference between the two camera's fastest shutter speeds will not mean much.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are often other features that differ between such models. In the case of the Canon 5D mark III versus the Canon 6D, for example, the 1-series focus system of the 5D3 is worth the difference in price compared to the less capable 'prosumer' focus system in the 6D, but only if you need the faster, more accurate, and more consistent focus system. On the other hand, the 6D includes built-in WiFi and GPS. If you need those extras, it will cost quite a bit to add them to the 5D3 via external modules.</p>

"Does ""long exposure noise reduction"" option make any difference when shooting RAW?","11039","","<p>I can configure my camera (5D) to use long exposure noise reduction (dark frame is exposed and subtracted), but is this method really effective when shooting RAW?

"Canon kit with standard EF-S 18-55mm IS or 18-135mm IS?","11029","","<p>I'm going to order a new Canon 550d in a kit with a lens. I'm fairly new to SLR photography which means I have not much knowledge about the difference between lenses.</p>

<p>There is an offer for a Canon 550d with the very common EF-S 18-55mm IS lens and an (more expensive) offer with a EF-S 18-135mm IS lens. I'm unsure about which one to buy.</p>

<p>My current knowledge tells me that the cheaper lens (18-55mm) has a more limited range and cannot zoom in as much as the more expensive 18-135mm one. The later one is also bigger and more heavy, right?</p>

<p>Are there any other differences but the maximum zoom-factor? Are both equally good for beginner-macro shoots? In which cases would you recommend which lens? Does it make sense to buy the kit and purchase the other one separately?</p>
","<p>Beyond the longer focal range, the 18-135 also features internal focusing, so filters don't rotate during auto-focus, which is very nice if you ever use a circular polarizer or graduated ND filter.</p>

<p>The only real downsides compared with the 18-55 are the increased weight and the decreased maximum magnification, making this less usable for macro-style shooting.</p>

<p>As you would expect with a kit, neither of these are wonderful, but the 18-135 is going to be a really good option, and you'll save a lot going with this instead of the higher end alternatives, such as the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0002Y5WXO"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM</a>.</p>

"How does autofocus work?","11027","","<p>How does auto focus work on modern cameras? How accurate is it?</p>
","<p>An AF system essentially consists of a sensor system that is linked (via the camera's processor) to the AF motor, which will either be in the lens or the camera body depending on the model.</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of autofocus. Active AF uses methods such as ultrasonics or infrared to measure the distance between the camera and the subject. A pulse is emitted from the camera, bounces off the subject, and returns. The time this takes is calculated in-camera and used to determine the distance. This kind of AF is independent of the lens/mirror system of the camera.</p>

<p>Passive AF analyses the image in the viewfinder instead. 2 methods are used in Passive AF. The first is Phase Detection. Here the image is split into two in the camera and the different phases of the two images are analysed. It achieves range-finding by essentially comparing how the two images diverge on the sensor. This is the system most modern DSLRs use, as it is the most accurate.</p>

<p>The second passive AF system is Contrast Detection. This is most commonly used in video cameras, and in DSLRs when in live view mode (essentially the same as a video camera). It works by analysing the contrast between pixels; the better the image is in focus, the greater the difference in intensity between pixels. So the camera checks intensity, focuses a little, checks again, etc., until it achieves a focus that gives an acceptable (preprogrammed) intensity difference. There is no actual range-finding going on. Contrast Detection is generally slower and less accurate than Phase Detection.</p>

<p>As for accuracy, generally, if used correctly, AF systems are very accurate (Passive Phase Detection being the most accurate). However, they often have problems in low-light (hence the AF lamp that comes on when you try and focus in the dark). The user also has to make sure that they are focusing on the correct point (e.g. focusing on the subject not the background).</p>

"What are the advantages and disdvantages of the Canon 18-55 IS MKII vs IS STM kit lenses?","11020","","<p>I'm trying to figure out the difference between the IS MKII lens and the IS STM lens.</p>

<p>Specifically, I am looking at the <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-EF-S-Zoom-Lens-18/dp/B004MKNBSW/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419335510&amp;sr=8-16&amp;keywords=canon+lens"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens</a>. On that Amazon page, there are three options; of the EF-S, one is listed as IS MK II; the other is IS STM.</p>

<p>I'm still not sure which is best to purchase - given the comparable price - I have heard pros and cons of each.</p>

<p>I understand that STM is a newer lens technology w/ a stepper motor for focusing, if I understand correctly, on manual focus, rather than adjusting the focus directly, you adjust the focus ring, and the stepper motor brings the lens to that focus point.</p>

<p>I have read that STM can be slower to focus than USM - however, I don't think the MK II has USM. The STM is supposed to be quieter, and thus better for AF while filming video.</p>

<p>Since the STM lens is newer (I think), is there any reason to buy the MK II? (The MK II is actually more expensive on the page listed.) Are there benefits to it, or pitfalls to the STM that I should consider?</p>

<p>Side note; my camera is an older Rebel XS; I'm not sure if the STM will work fully with it.</p>
","<p>According to the Wikipedia article comparing all Canon EF-S 18-55mm version the STM version has (in addition to the new STM motor) a new optical design (13 elements in 11 groups vs. 11 elements in 9 groups), internal focusing and an extra diaphragm blade (7 vs. 6)</p>

<p>So, the EF-S 18-55mm IS STM is not just the EF-S 18-55mm IS II with the new motor but a completely new lens that seams to be slightly better than the old design in every way.</p>

<p>Even if you don't need the advantage of the STM motor for video I see no reason to buy the older version (unless it's cheaper), I also don't see a compelling reason to upgrade for someone that already has the IS II but the new STM version is better.</p>

<p>BTW, you can usually buy seconds hand kit lenses for next to nothing because a lot of people want to get rid of them when they upgrade, a quick look on eBay shows that the EF-S 18-55mm IS II has been sold for as little as $40</p>

"Why is the 50mm prime lens the most standard?","11013","","<p>Seems that most photographers choose the 50mm as their prime lens (at least from what I've read).  I'm looking at getting a prime lens for my Nikon D3000 and the cost difference between the 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.4 is quite significant.  I know there must be some reason for the difference, and that the 1.4 will be able to get pictures in lower light and whatnot ~ it just seems that it is SUCH a large price difference for not much difference otherwise between the two lenses.  So, this isn't a ""weigh the pros and cons of the two lenses"" so much as a ""why do most photographers choose the 50mm 1.4""?</p>

<p>FWIW, I'm getting the lens to take pictures of my (fast moving) baby and toddler.  I have the kit lens and a 55-200mm 4.0-5.6 zoom lens and have trouble getting good pictures without being outside.</p>
","<p>Most standard because:</p>

<ul>
<li>50mm on a full frame is said to give a natural field of view.</li>
<li>50mm is apparently an simple focal length to design</li>

<p>Reasons why most photographers may choose the 50mm could be to use it for portraits on crop sensors.  75e is a great focal length for portraits, especially when combined with such a wide aperture.  Other reasons may include: higher resolution, smoother bokeh, better color, better rendition, higher contrast and microcontrast, more flare resistance, less CA, less distortion, less vignetting, better build quality, faster AF, etc.</p>

"Does it make sense to put an expensive lens on a cheap camera?","10997","","<p>I've spent a while looking at lenses and their prices, and now I'm wondering... Does it make sense to bolt a really expensive lens onto a cheap camera? Or is the extra performance only worth it if you have a similarly expensive camera to start with?</p>

<p>Is it ""sensible"" to buy a lens that costs 10x or 15x the price of the actual camera?</p>

<p>Or, on the contrary, is it ""expected"" that the lens is the expensive part?</p>

<p>(If I'm looking at the price list correctly, the £400 ""kit"" I bought consists of a £150 camera with a £250 lens. So already the lens is more expensive than the camera.)</p>

<p>Or is it that the price of the lens and the price of the camera are completely unrelated numbers, and you're paying for different attributes on each part?</p>
","<p>This is mostly an anecdote but here you go. At one point I was shooting on a Canon Rebel XT. New I believe I paid in the range of $500 for the camera. By the end of what I found to be the useful range of the body, I had used a $2,200 70-200mm lens, a $1,500 85mm lens, and a $1,200 50mm lens on multiple occasions. </p>

<p>The lenses all performed wonderfully, and if anything just exposed the limitations of the body I was using. I found that pairing great glass with a not so great body is well worth the exercise for two reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>To capture great images </li>
<li>To understand where my camera body is holding me back</li>
</ol>

<p>The lenses I give as my own personal examples only have a price difference of 2-4x.  A price difference of 10-15x is in a completely different realm. The body itself may not be quite up to the task and may immediately be exposed for its weaknesses. It is possible that it fits your skill set and vision just fine, but only you would know. </p>

<p>Further, if you really can afford a $2,500 lens, why buy a $250 camera? I'm surprised that such a camera will actually fulfill the requirements that a user of such a lens has. In other words, would someone that has a discerning enough eye that needs a $2,500 lens to get the quality that they need actually be happy with a very inexpensive $250 camera? That would be far from typical.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to bring the price multiplication factor a bit closer to the 2-3x range; I.e. If a $250 body suits your needs, check out $500-$750 lenses as a rough starting point. It is a good idea to spend a great percentage of your investment on lenses, but I think that 1 to 15 is far too great of a gap in all but the most extreme cases.</p>

<p>Can be seen in this paper, and with quantified quality data on 5 different algorithms: </p>

<p>This is why they made edge direction based interpolations. However, these treat green as a more ""important channel"" (since it has the best resolution and account for most of our visual sensitivity and our eyes' resolution). And then they create blue and red as a function of the green channel, in a hue preserving fashion. This in turn makes green channel high frequency content more prone to errors. Complexity is higher as they have to detect what's going on and require multiple passes. Moire and maizes are common artifacts from these types of interpolation.</p>

<p>Here they show examples of Adaptive Homogeneity Demosaicing and bilinear versions with and without hue preserving and edge preserving addons:</p>

<p>In summary there are a number of assumptions employed in these algorithms, and artifacts occur when the assumption doesn't hold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Per channel smoothness. If the nearest neighbors are not the same, make the transition smooth. Artifact: saws/zippers, softness</li>
<li>Brightness constancy with directed edges (bilinear direction). Artifacts: high frequency texture moire, colour fringing</li>
<li>Hue constancy. if in a neighborhood the hue is the same, so if one channel changes the others have to follow. Artifacts: colour zippers on colour edges</li>

","<p>JPEG Quality of 9 ~ 10 out of 12 (or 70 ~ 84 out of 100) is pretty indistinguishable from uncompressed.  See <a href=""http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/jpeg-quality"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> for an in-depth comparison.  In short, if you have less color gradients, you can get away with higher compression (lower quality values).</p>

<p>For PPI (what you care about), in general, 240 to 360 PPI is high quality.  This depends on typical viewing distances and your audience.  For example, with posters where people won't be walking up to and scrutinizing, you can get away with lower PPI because the viewing distance is further.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should find out what the printer's native PPI (not DPI) is and use a quality program and algorithm to resize (including upscaling) to that resolution, as opposed to letting their software or printer do the resizing.  </p>

<p>To calculate the number of pixels, simply take your desired physical output size, convert to inches if necessary, and multiply by the PPI:</p>

<p><code>10 cm by 15 cm<br>

"How to view side-car JPGs on lightroom? How to easily manage RAW+JPEG image reviews?","10933","","<p>I've been shooting RAW+JPEG and I'm importing them together into Lightroom (i.e. the JPEG becomes a side-car of the RAW file).</p>

<p>trouble is, I can't seem to find a way to review the out-of-camera JPEG (as opposed to Lightroom's rendition of the RAW file). How can I switch view between different side-cars of the same image in Lightroom?</p>

<p>For what is worth, I need a way to view different side cars (e.g. the JPEG that accompanies the RAW image), not decoupling them. For one, having them linked makes the first review and deletion of unwanted files a lot easier as I do not have to delete twice.</p>

<li><p>(at the user's discretion) review either file on its own and <em>tag</em> only one of them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After browsing a lot of pages with non-sensical advice, my conclusion is that most people talking about using Lightroom for RAW+JPEG management never really tried to practice any of their advice.</p>

The trouble with Lightroom's <em>auto-stacking</em> is <em>it does not allow you to tag all files in the stack with a single command</em>. So you can't just go through a stack of 1 RAW + 1 JPEG and just hit <code>X</code> to mark both as excluded.</p>

"Why is the lowest ISO always 100?","10920","","<p>The lowest ISO on digital cameras always seems to be 100. It would sometimes be useful to have much lower ISOs, mainly for long exposure photography.</p>

<p>What isn't there any 50, 20, or even 10 ISO setting ... ?</p>
","<p>Camera sensors (see <a href=""http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-sensors.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article for an overview) consist of a very large number of individual sensor elements, each of which can be regarded as a bucket that collects photons. These buckets have a maximum number of photons they can capture before they become full, which is called being saturated (this is when the highlights clip). This maximum capacity is not affected by the ISO setting of the camera.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/24492/9646"">this</a> question the lowest or ""base"" ISO usually corresponds to the unamplified sensitivity of the sensor, increasing the ISO results in the readings from the sensor being multiplied, meaning that the maximum value that can be stored in a recorded image can be reached before the sensor wells become saturated.</p>

<p>Decreasing the ISO would therefore require a 'deamplification' of the sensor readings, which can only be done after reading the sensor levels and so cannot actually decrease the sensitivity of the sensor to incoming light. This will cause any artificial decrease in sensitivity to also result in a corresponding decrease in dynamic range as you are compressing the total range of sensor levels into a less-than-total part of the range of levels that can be recorded in an image.</p>

<p>All this is a long way of saying that camera sensors have a fixed minimum sensitivity to light, regardless of what ISO it is referred to as. Any artificial decrease of ISO below this sensor minimum will both not actually make the sensor less sensitive to light and will also decrease the range of light levels that can be recorded in an image.</p>

<p>Neutral density filters solve the problem of wanting a longer exposure (without clipping) than the camera's minimum sensitivity allows by reducing the amount of light that hits the sensor, which causes the sensor buckets to fill up at a slower rate than they would without the filter being used.</p>

<p>Decreasing the ISO below the minimum can only be done after the recorded values are read from the sensor and therefore cannot actually darken the image hitting the sensor which is what is required to get a 'genuinely' extended exposure time. What such a decrease would result in is an increase in perceived exposure time when looking at the final image that is actually just an artefact of squashing the light levels recorded on the sensor into a smaller range when writing them into the image. Neutral density filters do make the image hitting the sensor darker which does result in an extended 'genuine' exposure time.</p>

<p>The numerical value of the lowest ISO is calculated by reference to standards as described in <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/9051/9646"">this</a> question.</p>

"What is the difference between teleconverters and extension tubes?","10918","","<p>I'm aware of two devices that can extend the reach of a lens: the teleconverter and the extension tubes. What else would they have in common, and where do they differ?</p>

<p>Are there situations where one would be preferable over the other?</p>
","<p>The two devices do entirely different things.</p>

<p><strong>Extension tube:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>An empty tube which moves the lens further away from the sensor.</li>
<li>The point is that as you focus on closer and closer objects, the focused image (which you want to place on the sensor) moves further from the lens. Eventually the lens reaches the limit of its travel and closer objects focus behind the sensor. Adding an extension tube gives you more room to do this, so you can focus on closer objects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teleconverter:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Contains optical elements which increase the focal length of your lens.</li>
<li>As a consequence, the maximum aperture shrinks (making the lens slower).</li>
<li>For example, a 300mm f/2.8 with a 1.4x TC becomes a 420mm f/4 (you lose one stop), and with a 2x TC it becomes a 600mm f/5.6 (you lose two stops).</li>
<li>Typically, TCs work best with telephoto lenses.</li>
<li>Teleconverters can make autofocus stop working by reducing the maximum aperture beyond the limit of the autofocus system (often f/5.6). For example, adding a 2x TC to a f/4 lens results in a f/8 lens, which probably won't autofocus.</li>
<li>Also, adding elements to a lens degrades its quality somewhat; this may or may not be a visible problem. Generally, you will want a lens and TC which are designed to work together to minimize this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both (if good-quality) contain mechanics and electronics to let the lens and body ""talk"", to keep auto-focus and metering working.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UV Filters:<br>
  Many photographers feel that it is worthwhile to put a UV filter on the front of every lens, on the basis that this will protect the front lens element - from dust, scratches and catastrophic damage if the lens is dropped. In other words, it is a kind of insurance policy against lens damage. I understand that Scott Kelby takes this position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since prime lenses are not supposed to zoom can dust, water, etc still get inside it if I don't use a filter?</p>
","<p>The filter doesn't protect against dust getting ""into"" the lens, it just protects the front element. So the arguments for a filter are equally valid for zooms and primes.</p>

<p>Personally I don't use them, as they have a negative impact on image quality. Always keeping you lens hood on is another way to protect the front element.</p>

<p>Also, I recently damaged my lens (a prime), as I dropped it while changing lenses. Two elements fell out the back, and the focusing system got ruined, but the front element is intact. So the filter is no magical protection for your lens.</p>

"HDR then Panorama, or Panorama then HDR?","10859","","<p>When creating a panorama for a scene of huge dynamic range, intuitively I always <strong>merge exposure brackets to HDR and tone-map them and then stitch the resulting images into a panorama</strong>. My intuition here is that the HDR process is much more predictable than the stitching process, so I start with the former. I realize this may be because I know a lot about HDR (worked on HDR S/W for 9 years) and little about stitching software.</p>

<p><strong>Is this the right order to do this and why?</strong></p>

<p>This question came up because in the book <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781933952451"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mastering Panorama Photography</a> the author stitches first and then merges the LDR panoramas into a HDR one. He mentions this but does not explain why.</p>
","<p>Doing HDR first has advantages: the HDR process is working on a smaller image size, and you only have to stitch one set of images.</p>

<p>But the disadvantage of doing the HDR step first is it becomes more difficult to exactly match the tones between sets of images, so when you stitch them together you get more obvious seams.  If you are able to control this and don't have this problem, then I could see it being easier to do HDR first.  But for most people they will have ended up with slightly different HDR adjustments done and they will have seams to deal with.</p>

<p>Edit: I have recently found that doing the pano stitching step first, sometimes the resulting files have slightly different dimensions, off by a pixel or two, and then the HDR processor complains that the images must be the same dimension.</p>

"What does it mean when film turns out transparent after being developed?","10852","","<p>I had a B/W film turn out transparent after being developed. Does it mean that a) it was never exposed b) it was always overexposed or c) something went wrong during development?</p>
","<p>The problem is definitely not overexposure; that renders negatives black.</p>

<p>To work out whether it was underexposure or a development problem, there's a fairly straight-forward indicator: Do you see any edge markings (marked red in the example below)?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FSt5D.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>They'll vary from film to film; not all will have barcodes, but there's usually a name or number at the very least.  These are exposed onto the film at the factory, and should show up if development was correct.</p>

<p><strong>If you have edge markings</strong> then the problem is most likely on the camera side of things.  There's a few possibilities; the camera didn't wind correctly, the shutter is jammed or sticky and doesn't open correctly.  On the less-likely-but-still-possible end of things, you may have left the lenscap on, or drastically underexposed the entire roll (e.g., set to 1/1000s accidentally while shooting in a dark pub).</p>

<p><strong>If you have no edge markings</strong> then there was almost certainly an error in development. Exactly what type of error is hard to say, but there are a couple of usual suspects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You developed the film yourself: if it's perfectly clear, with not a trace of density anywhere, then you may have used fixer before developer, or didn't use developer.  If there's small amounts of density, the developer may have gone bad, or it may be severely under-developed (e.g., you only left it in for a minute or two when 12 was required).</p></li>
<li><p>A lab developed the film: they may have developed standard black-and-white in a C-41 process.  One of the final steps of C-41 removes all the silver from the film, leaving only dyes. Standard black and white is only silver, and the image is destroyed by the C-41 process.</p></li>

"Why are lenses always round in shape?","10846","","<p>Why are lenses round in shape although the image sensor is not? Why they can not be square or something matching the shape of image sensor?</p>
","<p>Sensors are rectangular by tradition, based on the historically traditional shape of image media. </p>

<p>But there is a technology/business decision that drives them to be rectangular, also. Sensors are rectangular because they are made using semiconductor fabrication techniques. These techniques call for “printing” multiple sensor circuits onto a silicon wafer. Today these wafers can be 300 mm in diameter and manufacturers are moving toward 450 mm diameter (<a href=""http://anysilicon.com/does-size-matter-understanding-wafer-size/"" rel=""noreferrer"">see here</a>). A lot of sensors can be printed on wafers that large.</p>

<p>Sensors are tiled onto the wafer to efficiently use the space available and in a way that makes them easy to cut apart into “dies” (or the individual sensors, in this case). The process is called dicing. The most cost effective shape for dies is rectangular. Usually a saw or scribe is used to cut the wafers in straight lines. Imagine if the dies (sensors in this case) were supposed to be round (a wasteful and costly use of the material) or hexagonal (efficient use of the material but the cuts are not straight across the whole wafer). (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_dicing"" rel=""noreferrer"">See here for more info.</a>)</p>

<p>B) Lenses made of high quality glass are generally ground using lathes. (This can be seen in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYq0gHU3voI"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video</a>. Watch around the 7:00 minute mark in particular. Sorry, it's in Japanese, but the video is very fascinating and revealing.) It is easier to spin, grind, and polish a round lens in these machines because there are no edges to catch on the tooling as the lens spins around. It also is consistent with the optical symmetry they are trying to achieve in the finished lens.</p>

<p>Lenses that are not round would generally be cut from round lenses, a step that adds cost to the production of the lens assembly. Lenses don’t need to be round. For heaven’s sake, most eyeglasses are not round! When your eyeglasses are made, you must be aware that the lens maker isn’t stocking a lens for every shape of eyeglass frame. He’s cutting or grinding round lenses to fit the frame.</p>

<p>Once the lens manufacturer has his round lenses, what would motivate him to cut it into a different shape? As many people have pointed out in various forums, the lens shape does not determine the image shape or quality (apart from diffraction caused by edges, which can be mitigated, and some second order aberration effects, maybe), and for the most part, every point on the lens can gather light from every point on the object and focus each point on the image plane. I’ve already pointed out that changing the shape of the lens adds cost. There really isn’t any practical reason (generally) for changing the shape.</p>

<p>This is confusing to me though, since I thought jpgs don't have layers and are flattened. Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Do jpgs actually have layers?</p>
","<p>At least in my computers (Windows, various versions) editing a .jpg file in Photoshop and saving it creates a situation where, if there is some type of embedded thumbnail, Photoshop does not update it, later on while viewing the file in another program (Windows Image Viewer for example) the thumbnail is loaded first and shown (upscaled to fit) while the program processes the compressed jpeg data to create the full resolution image.</p>

<p>Most of the time, these programs are not fast enough so that the eye almost always catches the enlarged thumbnail before the actual image. In my case, I get to see the (yet) uncorrected colors, the uncropped framing, etc. (I.e. the image lacking whatever changes I made in Ps).</p>

<p>This is no anoyance (for me) at all, but I have seen that using ""Save As"" with a different name, instead of the regular ""Save"" avoids this situation.</p>

<p>What leads me to think that there is a thumbnail embedded in the metadata segment of the file is that if I transfer the edited file to a computer where no previous version of the image exists, the ""original ghost"" can be seen when opening the picture.</p>

<p>Another option that avoids the issue is saving a file with the ""Save for Web"" command. This uses a routine that somehow compresses the jpeg a little bit more while apparently not reducing the quality so much. Part of the algorithm includes striping most non-image data before creating the new file.</p>

<p>When I do this, I notice the Windows Picture Viewer takes a little extra time before showing anything at all, specially if the file was not created using ""progessive"" in the ""Save For Web"" dialog.</p>

<p>P.S. Windows usually creates a thumbnail database for folder that contains only pictures or mostly pictures. Editing a picture, or overwriting the file almost always makes Windows (At least XP &amp; Vista) show the incorrect thumbnail when browsing the directory in  Windows Explorer. I'm aware this is a totally different problem and seems to be unrelated to the issue described by the O.p. When this bothers me enough, I delete the hidden ""thumbs.db"" file in the offending folder then switch the view mode to anything but Large Thumbnails and then back to that. This forces the creation of a new thumbs.db file that should use the actual data from the files in the folder.</p>

Squeezing a handle to free the head for positioning seems like a great idea. The problem I kept running into, however, is that I needed three hands: right hand on the shutter, left hand on the lens zoom ring, and third hand on the pistol grip. (You <em>need</em> to squeeze the handle to free the head, as opposed to a ball head that can simply be unlocked and move.) When using a prime this isn't a problem, and it's easy to zoom to a roughly-correct range to make positioning easier. Another problem was that those heads are pretty tall, and compared to a lower-profile ball head they did have a tendency to flop around more easily. Anyway, needing three hands was a problem I encountered regularly enough that I switched to a ball head, which I do prefer.</p>

","<p>If you're setting up the lights, and they're a fixed distance away from your subject, then use manual.  Other than if you fire your flashes with insufficient power, your exposure will be consistent from frame to frame.  That's the boring example.  Nothing is moving.  TTL doesn't gain anything over manual.</p>

<p>If the distance isn't fixed, then it's still possible to shoot manual and alter your f-stop to control the exposure.  This works relatively easily with a single, fixed light and a moving subject.  I've done this successfully with a studio strobe and a toddler.</p>

<p>If the distance isn't fixed, and you have multiple flashes, and the distance between all of them and your subject may change rapidly, then TTL will help preserve what little sanity you may have left.

It's a small ""utility"" window which typically floats near the right side of your screen. And open your file, if you haven't yet. With that window open, you can click on the existing layer in the image (probably <em>Background</em>), and then click on the Duplicate Layer button below — or press <code>Shift-Ctrl-D</code>. Then, to merge that layer back down again, go to the Image menu and pick Merge Visible Layers (<code>Ctrl-M</code>). You can also use Flatten Image. Alternately, if you have more than two layers, there's Merge Down in the Layers menu, which does what it says.</p>

","<p>It would depend on the specific camera, but in many cameras Live View will show 100% coverage (the final image will be the same as what you see in the LCD) where the viewfinder may only be 95% (true on certain Nikon models at least).</p>

<p>Live View uses a different autofocus mechanism, which seems slower to me, but is said to be more accurate.  It is often used to focus in landscape and macro photography, and has the advantage that you can even zoom in on your subject to check focus more accurately.</p>

<p>Live View has a distinct advantage in low light where the image on the LCD will be brightened so it is easier to see your subject and compose, whereas the viewfinder will become dim as the light fades.</p>

<p>Live View will be a drain on the battery.</p>

"How do mountains affect lighting at sunrise and sunset?","10760","","<p>I just got back from a trip in the Rockies. The tall and close mountains mean that the sun sets earlier than flatter places at the same latitude -- perhaps by an hour or so. The same applies to sunrises, depending of course on the precise location relative to the mountains.</p>

<p>Although I haven't paid a lot of attention to it, it seems to me that the sunset light in the mountains looks different than that on the plains. I'd say it's more blue (vs. red/yellow), perhaps brighter, and perhaps more direct. </p>

<p>I'm thinking that this might have something to do with the angle of the sun at sunset (much higher in the mountains) and how it relates to the atmosphere (thinner at that angle).</p>

<p>Does this really exist (or am I making this up)?

Do locations surrounded by mountains even get a proper Golden Hour? </p>
","<p>You're right. </p>

<p>The atmosphere has a prismatic effect, spreading white light out into its constituent colors. As the sun moves down to the horizon, you the viewer move into the orange-red band of light. The lower the sun can get, the more red the light will be.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is also a diffuser. The more of it there is between you and the light source, the more diffuse (less direct) the light will be. The higher you are, the less atmosphere there is between you and the sun.</p>

"What camera settings would make shooting easy in a darkish church?","10713","","<p>I tried to take photographs in a church that was bright enough for human eyes, but I quickly realized the camera couldn't take it. Failing to anticipate this, I didn't bring a tripod.</p>

<p>Since I don't have a very calm hand, I didn't want to have long exposure times. Instead, I've set my camera to the following settings, arguing that I could fix the brightness in Photoshop, and shot in raw:</p>

<pre><code>Exposure Time: 0,02s 
ISO 6400
</code></pre>

<p>The photos are sharp and, with some editing, bright enough. However, they are <strong>grainy beyond repair</strong>.</p>

<p>While I've learned my lesson and will bring a tripod to the next session, I'm curious if I could have improved any of the settings for better results with similarly short exposure times.</p>

<p>My Camera is a Canon EOS 600D with Magic Lantern.</p>
","<p>Camera settings are never going to make this easy. Photographs need light to work, and while modern sensors are actually quite sensitive, they can't live up to our perceptions, because our brains take the dark, noisy image from our eyes and subconsciously make a mental model where the imperfections aren't noticed.</p>

<p>You don't mention what lens you are using, but one thing you can do is to use the widest possible aperture — and possibly even get a <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/13619/what-is-a-fast-lens"">faster lens</a>. The kit lens that comes with most cameras tends to be very slow, particularly when zoomed in. (That's because these lenses have <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/13918/why-do-zoom-lenses-and-compact-cameras-have-varied-maximum-aperture-across-the-z"">variable max aperture</a>, and usually about 2½× faster at the wide end.) </p>

<p>One very popular Canon recommendation is the 50mm f/1.8, which you can get around $100. (Other brands have similar lenses, although the Canon version happens to be a spectacularly good deal.) At 50mm, this will let in about <em>10×</em> the light of the kit lens at 50mm. (However, it will also have very shallow depth of field, which may or may not be good for what you want.)</p>

<p>Another possibility is to <em>bring light</em>. Depending on when and what you're photographing and whether you're doing it by request or with official permission, you may be able to set something up using flashes. Cavernous churches don't make getting nice lighting easy, but this may be better than nothing. If you have the ability to set something up, spending a few hundred dollars on remote-triggered flashes could make all the difference.</p>

<p>Finally, you might want to reconsider what ""grainy beyond repair"" means to you. You note that you're shooting in RAW, which should give you fairly wide latitude in noise reduction. If you're not making gigantic prints — that is, 8×10"" or smaller, or viewing online without zooming all the way in for no good reason — you actually should be able to get quite acceptable results at ISO 6400.</p>

Be careful here as you may have parts of the face go out of focus. Step back with a long lens and you'll eliminate that problem (by increasing the over all dof). </p>

"Why is a physical anti-aliasing filter still needed on modern DSLRs?","10641","","<p>I understand the purpose of the anti-aliasing (AA) filter is to prevent moire. When digital cameras first emerged an AA filter was necessary to creat enough blur to prevent moire patterns. At that time the power of in camera processors was very limited. <strong>But why is it still necessary to place an AA filter over the sensor in modern DSLR cameras?</strong> <em>Couldn't this be accomplished just as easily by the algorithms applied when the output from the sensor is being demosaiced?</em> It would seem that the current processing power available in-camera would allow this now much more than even a few years ago. Canon's current Digic 5+ processor has over 100 times the processing power of the Digic III processor, which dwarfs the power of the earliest digital cameras. Especially when shooting RAW files, couldn't the AA blurring be done in the post processing stage? Is this the basic premise of the Nikon D800E, even though it uses a second filter to counteract the first?</p>
","<p>Aliasing is the result of repeating patterns of roughly the same frequency interfering with each other in an undesirable manner. In the case of photography, the higher frequencies of the image projected by the lens onto the sensor creates and interference pattern (moiré in this case) with the pixel grid. This interference only occurs when those frequencies are roughly the same, or when the sampling frequency of the sensor matches the wavelet frequency of the image. That is the Nyquist limit. Note...that is an analog issue...moiré occurs because of interference that occurs real-time in the real-world before the image is actually exposed. </p>

<p>Once the image is exposed, that interference pattern is effectively ""baked in"". You can use software to some degree to clean moiré patterns up in post, but it is minimally effective when compared to a physical low pass (AA) filter in front of the sensor. The loss in detail due to moiré can also be greater than that lost to an AA filter, as moiré is effectively nonsense data, where slightly blurred detail could still be useful. </p>

<p>An AA filter is just designed to blur those frequencies at Nyquist so they do not create any interference patterns. The reason we still need AA filters is because image sensors and lenses are still capable of resolving down to the same frequency. When sensors improve to the point where the sampling frequency of the sensor itself is consistently higher than even the best lenses at their optimal aperture, then the need for an AA filter would diminish. The lens itself would effectively handle the necessary blurring for us, and interference patterns would never emerge in the first place.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of constant-aperture zoom lenses, for a relative beginner?","10628","","<p>I use a Sony NEX-5R, and I bought the Sony 18-105 F4 constant-aperture lens.</p>

<p>I'm aware that the constant-aperture F4 gathers more light than, say a F3.5 - 5.6, and it gives you more control over the depth of field. I'm also aware that constant-aperture lenses are heavier, bigger and more expensive.</p>

<p>What are the other tradeoffs? Would I get a lens of better quality for the same price if I don't insist on a constant aperture?</p>

<p>Do constant-aperture lenses make a practical difference for low-light shooting, in aperture or shutter speed priority mode? If the aperture changes as you zoom in with a variable-aperture lens, the camera can always compensate by varying the shutter speed and / or ISO, so does it make a <strong>noticeable</strong> difference in practice, for low-light shooting?</p>

<p>And, taking a step up from F4 constant-aperture zooms, how do F2.8 constant-aperture zoom lenses compare? Are they generally as sharp as prime lenses? In other words, if I don't need a wider aperture than F2.8, would an F2.8 constant-aperture zoom lens substitute for multiple prime lenses in its focal length?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Many times when shooting action in limited light you are using manual exposure mode with the widest aperture <em>and</em> the slowest shutter speed you can without getting camera blur or blur from the motion of your subject(s). By using a constant aperture zoom lens you don't need to change the ISO to compensate for the change in aperture as you zoom. Some cameras allow the use of Auto ISO in manual shooting mode but most don't. For what I shoot on a regular basis there is a <strong>world</strong> of difference between a constant aperture zoom and a variable aperture one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would I get a lens of better quality for the same price if I don't insist on a constant aperture?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general constant aperture zooms tend to have better optical quality than variable aperture zooms. It is not so much an inherent quality of a constant aperture design as it is an indicator of what the market demands out of higher priced lenses. Usually, but certainly not always, the tradeoff isn't better optical quality in exchange for a variable aperture design. Rather it is variable aperture in exchange for a cheaper price.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That all depends on the particular lens. The Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS II is one such lens that can answer <em>yes</em> to your last question. A few other zooms are very close or equal to their prime counterparts at the same aperture settings. But there are other zooms whose image quality falls far short of their prime or narrower aperture counterparts. The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8 L II is one such lens in this category. The EF 16-35mm f/4 L is better at pretty much every common combination of aperture and focal length than the first two versions of the 16-35 f/2.8 and is also quite a bit more affordable. The newly released EF 16-35mm f/2.8 L III, however, is significantly better than all of Canon's previous 16-35mm zoom lenses. It's also quite a bit more expensive than the others.</p>

When I close and reopen LR I can still see the changes, but my original important RAW file is intact. So I'm curious, where/how LR keeps my changes on top of RAW file? Can I make my changes on imported RAW file? Say want to crop imported file and keep just cropped version.</p>
","<p>Lightroom does not make changes to the original file. It stores the actions of each edit in the LR catalog. When you Export an image to, say a JPEG, LR performs each of those actions, creating a new file, in this case a JPEG. It never alters the original.  The RAW file isnt really an image, but data that was recorded by the sensor. You see an image in preview because the RAW file actually stores a small JPEG preview image within the file. So 'cropping' the RAW isn't meaningful. You instead use the RAW data to create an image that you can crop as your final output. The output can be JPEG, TIFF, PSD, DNG, etc.</p>

<p>The catalog location can be found by looking under Catalog Settings.</p>

<p>You can also ask Lightroom to store these same edit actions in a 'sidecar' file, which will be stored alongside (in the same directory) of your RAW image, by selecting ""Automatically write changes to XMP"" in the Metadata tab of Catalog settings. </p>

","<p>What you're looking at through the viewfinder is actually the image from the lens projected onto a ground-glass viewing screen. You want the diopter level to be adjusted so you can see <em>that</em> most clearly.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this means that you can use the etched lines on the focusing screen, as well as the status information in the viewfinder, to adjust the diopter correction. Point the camera at a featureless bright-but-not-overwhelming subject (a white wall, say), and set the lens's focus such that the wall is just a blur. Now ignore that and set the diopter so the focus screen markings and indicator information are as sharp as you can get them.</p>

","<p>""Auto Lighting Optimizer"" is Canon's term for in-camera post-processing to automatically adjust shadows and highlights in high-contrast images. Nikon has a similar feature called ""
""Active D-Lighting"", and other makers have corresponding capabilities as well.</p>

<p>These all do the same thing: they adjust the tone curve so shadows are brightened and highlights roll off more smoothly.

Sometimes you get good results, and sometimes... not so much.</p>

<p>The histogram is basically unrelated, although if you see that your scene smashes up against both ends, that's a good indication that using this feature might help.</p>

<p>Now, as for whether ""pro photographers"" use this: sure. Some definitely do. Professional photographers do many different things, have many different approaches, and correspondingly have very different needs. This doesn't have very much impact on whether the feature is good for <em>you</em>, even if you are a pro yourself or aspire to be one.</p>

<p>For some pros, getting decent results fast is the most important. They're trying to make a living, not art, or perfection.

"Can I set Lightroom's white balance picker tool to choose a supposedly white/black spot instead of neutral grey? Or should I care?","10468","","<p>I'm correcting white balance issues for my photos in <strong>Adobe Lightroom 3</strong>. The <code>white balance picker tool</code> in the <code>Develop</code> module lets me to pick a light neutral grey spot in the picture from which Lightroom automatically calculates the needed data for white balance corrections. I didn't had a grey card.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I set the picker so I could choose a spot that <strong>should be white</strong> (or black) <strong>after white balance corrections?</strong></li>
<li>Or should I be just fine and <strong>consider the chosen neutral grey spot as underexposed</strong> (or overexposed) <strong>white</strong> (or black); since the neutral grey is &mdash; well, neutral, and white balance corrects the white balance, not the exposure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare to e.g. <strong>Photoshop's</strong> <code>curves</code> and <code>exposure</code> tools which both have this feature (choosing either supposedly neutral grey, white or a black spot).</p>

<p>I do have access to Photoshop and could correct WB with it, but I'd like to edit the photos non-destructively.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: After a closer look, the <code>white balance picker tool</code> doesn't ask for a <em>target neutral</em> <strong><em>grey</em></strong> spot but just for a <em>target</em> <strong><em>neutral</em></strong>.</p>

<p>In short: you must pick a spot which <strong>should appear as neutral</strong> &mdash; ie. where R ≈ G ≈ B &mdash; <strong>after</strong> Lightroom's automatic adjustments.</p>

","<p>I think the key point with setting (just) white balance is that you pick something where the colour channels should have, more or less, the same intensity. Therefore, picking something that is supposed to be white should also have the desired effect, although it's best to stay away from the <em>extreme</em> neutral greys (white and definitely black). Using a specific tool to pick a white or black point is usually about more than just white balance.</p>

"Should I use RAW or JPEG for wedding photography?","10435","","<p>I am about to shoot in a wedding ceremony and would like to know, Should I shoot in RAW or JPEG?</p>

<p>I asked a photographer (outside the US) and he said converting RAW into JPG changes color (or something like that) so they always shoot in JPG. I won't buy it unless someone convinces me here. I see the convenience of shooting in JPG: no conversion, smaller size — and, adjust lighting and the photo is ready.</p>

<p>I have a Nikon D5100 and a 16 GB card, so I can take plenty of RAW pics. My RAW file size is +22MB vs JPEG is 1.3-4 MB.</p>

<p>Is RAW always required or is RAW for some times and JPG is fine too?</p>

<p><em>I know there are related question but this question is related to wedding photography only. Thanks. Let me clarify. I think in Pakistan photographers never shoot in RAW.</em></p>
","<p>JPEG offers two advantages (other than how many images you can fit on a card) that may be extremely significant under the right circumstances: the speed of workflow after the shoot (assuming you've gotten things right in camera) and the speed at which you can shoot.</p>

<p>RAW files take a lot longer to write to the card than JPEGs do (and RAW+JPEG takes longer still), so in the genres of photography where you need to take a lot of pictures quickly, a given camera will almost always perform better when shooting JPEGs. That is important to sports and wedding photographers as well as to photojournalists. The absolute last thing you want is to have your shutter release locked or delayed because your camera's buffer is full. And it doesn't matter whether that means getting the 9-10 FPS of a high-end speed demon like the Nikon D3s or the Canon EOS 1D Mk. IV or squeezing 3-4 FPS out of an older or entry-to-mid-level camera, having to wait for the buffer to write out to the card may mean missing the only shot that counts.</p>

<p>And while JPEGs limit you in what you <em>can</em> do in post-processing, they also limit what you <em>have to</em> do in post-processing. That difference in turn-around time can make a big difference to the amount of work you are able to take on, especially when you're working at the lower-priced, more cut-throat end of the industry. It may take (on average) a thirtieth of a second to take a picture, but it takes a lot longer than that to review, cull, and refine them afterwards. Even an extra ten seconds per picture (or series) can mean giving up another shooting day, so the financial advantages to shooting JPEG and getting it right in-camera are very real at that level. Most of the better cameras will let you set custom picture settings (more than one) so that your ""signature look"" can happen primarily in the camera.</p>

<p>Of course, if you get it wrong in-camera shooting JPEGs, you can't hide your mistakes nearly as easily or as well. So you need to balance the business risks of missing the shot, taking too long in post and having the ultimate control in post. A best-case compromise might be to shoot the formals (the ones that you can take some time over, and that have to be absolutely perfect) in RAW and the spontaneous action in JPEG. But it is a <em>business</em> decision, not a photographic one.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Adapter that places the lens farther than it's supposed to be</strong> - this has the same effect as placing the lens on a macro extension tube, you lose the ability to focus to infinity and from what I heard you are likely to lose the ability to focus behind macro range.</p></li>

"Why is digital photography so expensive?","10370","","<p>Even after a decade since its inception, digital photography is still expensive.
Each and every component from battery, lenses, accessories to printing is expensive. For a student who wants to pursue photography by acquiring some decent gear it is considerably difficult. Why is it so?</p>
","<p>Digital photography is not expensive but buying into it is.</p>

<p>With film photography camera and lenses were a moderate investment but these lasted quite long. Even a battery in a film camera would last several years. Cameras and lenses were mechanical and much simpler than today's models. This made them require less expertise to manufacture and also made them incredibly sturdy. A lifespan of a decade for a camera and several decades for lenses was not uncommon.</p>

<p>However, the real cost of film photography is film and development. Each roll of film costs several dollars and gives up to 36 images. Specialized rolls were more expensive and had fewer exposures. Then, if you did not do development yourself, you had to pay for development. Also prints. Even if you did your own, chemicals and papers were recurring costs. And there was the added expensive of creating a wet darkroom. In the end, the hobby was quite costly.</p>

<p>With digital photography, you pay nearly all costs up-front and it comes out much cheaper for anyone who is into the art and shoots regularly. A mid-range DSLR with good lens and memory can easily be obtained for less than $2500. Many entry level ones exist for under $1000. If you were to shoot 10,000 frames before both your camera and lens dies, it would cost you between 2.5&cent; to 10&cent; per frame. It is far far less than even just the film for each frame. Still most cameras have shutters rated to at least 100,000 frames and lenses last much longer than cameras. Even if you only captured 1000 images, you would have a better deal than with film photography. All digital cameras come with rechargeable batteries, good for 500-1000 shots-per-charge (for DSLRs) and can be charged at least 50-100 times before needing to be replaced. That means you actually will not use up the battery before you have taken full advantage of the better value of digital photography.</p>

<p>Market conditions are forcing the price of digital photography to increase. The loss of market share of compact and ultra-compact digital cameras to cellphones forced manufacturers to discontinue such products and concentrate on higher-end offering. While the number of unit sales of digital cameras has been declining, the average price is going up to compensate for reduced revenue. This trend is expected to continue for a while.</p>

<p>There's a number of things that you can do to make this better:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the point of light larger. The professionals often use massive softboxes - large uniformly illuminated boxes of light which give very soft shadows which are very flattering. You can make your source of light slightly larger by <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000B5H2BE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">buying</a> or <a href=""http://www.diyphotography.net/diy-built-in-pop-up-flash-diffuser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">making</a> a diffuser - something that sits in front of your flash and diffuses the small point into a larger point of light.</li>
<li>Bounce the flash off the ceiling. This is like turning the ceiling into a massive softbox. You can achieve this by putting a small piece of white card at a 45 degree angle in front of the flash. Experiment until you get the best results.</li>
<li>Use a longer exposure to balance the flash and the ambient light. Try putting the camera on a tripod or stable surface and allowing a long exposure as well as the flash. This is good for capturing a specific moment but allowing the background light to fill in the dark shadows that you would get otherwise. This is often set up as an automatic scene mode called ""Night Portrait"" or something similar. </li>

","<p>I think it would also be interesting to share some ideas on avoiding those spots.</p>

<p>When the spots are in different places on each frame as it seems to be, it's <strong>dust in the air</strong> combined with a <strong>flash too close to lens</strong>. The strong light near the flash makes the particles visible and the closeness to lens front makes them very out-of-focus and therefore blurred bigger than they really are.</p>

<p>Using an <strong>external flash</strong> would avoid the spots, unfortunately most compact cameras do not have any means for connecting one and while using one off-camera is still possible (by using manual mode, an optical slave and shielding the on-camera flash), it's too awkward and inconvenient in social situations where a compact camera is typically used.</p>

<p>Sometimes it might be possible to find another place with <strong>less dust</strong> or <strong>more light</strong> so that flash would not be needed.</p>

<p>You could try holding a credit card between the flash and lens as a <strong>shield</strong> keeping the flash from lighting the immediate front of lens; when doing so, check that the lower part of photo is still correctly illuminated. </p>

<p><strong>Bouncing</strong> the flash away (using a reflective surface) or using a <strong>diffuser</strong> might also help. In those cases, maximum reach for the flash will be shorter.</p>

"How should I clean my focusing screen?","10336","","<p>While on holidays I managed to get hair and dust onto the focusing screen of my 550D. How should I clean this off.</p>

<p>I have already tried a normal lens cloth, but that only made it worse.</p>
","<p>Well, first I should mention that dust on the focusing screen has no effect on the image quality or the exposure metering, so for that sake there is no need to clean it. On the other hand the dust may get loose and get onto the sensor, so it's a good preventive measure tog get the worst dust away at least.</p>

<p>To clean it, you should first turn the camera off, to reduce the static electricity. A <a href=""http://www.computeruniverse.net/products/90054196/hama-dust-ex-blasebalg.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dust blower</a> is good for removing dust. A brush can also be useful, but the drawback is that they tend to lose bristles now and again, which adds to the matter that you want to remove.</p>

"What is a focus limiter?","10320","","<p>What is a focus limiter and how does it work? What is the advantage of it? For instance <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/reviews/Tamron-90mm-f-2.8-Di-Macro-Lens-Review.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tamron 90/2.8 Macro</a> has a focus limiter. According to the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the limit position, the Tamron 90
  will autofocus between 11.4"" and
  15.75"" (290mm and 400mm) or 17.7"" (450mm) and infinity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is it possible to choose between then 290-400 and 450-inf working mode? Does it affect manual focusing?</p>
","<p>A focus limiter simply restricts the range of distances the camera will attempt to focus at. This improves both the speed of focus and the accuracy (as it is assumed you are only interested in subjects within the range you have selected). </p>

<p>You tend to see them a lot on macro lenses, which can focus from a few centimeters up to infinity. Often a lot of travel in the focus mechanism is only covering the first few metres (you'll notice if you look at a lens with a distance scale that it is logarithmic). The limiter helps the lens behave as if it had a normal focus range when you're not shooting macro. </p>

<p>Most cameras when they can't lock on focus will have the lens search through the range of focus distances until some detail is detected, this is sometimes called ""hunting"". With a macro lens this can take a while. You also get limiters on telephoto lenses as most of the time you're using a telephoto because you're shooting something far away so can safely ignore the closer range. It can improve accuracy by preventing focus from accidentally locking on to foreground objects. </p>

<p>You select the modes via a switch on the side of the lens. The limiting is implemented in the communication between the lens and camera, it is not a mechanical limiter so it doesn't affect manual focus.</p>

"Is there a way to get Magic Lantern on my newer model Canon dSLR?","10264","","<p>I recently bought a Canon Rebel T6i (750D) and have a short film project coming up soon. I want Magic Lantern on my camera (SD Card) for its fantastic enhanced features, but I am unable to find it from the Magic Lantern website or any other sources.</p>

<p>It would be a great help if someone could post a source where I can download this.</p>
","<p>The newer your Canon camera model is, the less likely it is that there will be a Magic Lantern build for it (just as with Canon P&amp;S cameras, the less likely it is there will be a CHDK build for it). These things take time to develop. If you <strong>have</strong> to have these features right now, your best bet is to get a hold of one of the models that <em>is</em> supported. The newest dRebel model that is currently supported is the 700D (which came out in 2013); your 750D came out this year.  It may take two years or more from the time the camera's introduced.</p>

<p>Understand that <em>Magic Lantern isn't anybody's job</em>. It's an open source project developed by volunteers.  For them to develop a build for your camera, they need access to a copy of your camera, and enough volunteers willing and capable of a) downloading the firmware, b) adapting ML's source code for it, c) testing that build, d) and debugging it.  These things can all be relatively scarce, as is the spare time for volunteers to do them. </p>

<p>If you need a build for your camera and it doesn't exist yet, the best thing you can do is to volunteer and contribute to the ML development effort (see: <a href=""http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=16052.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this thread where someone steps up for the 760D</a>) or donate.</p>

<p>But understand that the ML folks get overwhelmed <em>all the time</em> by folks who ""need"" ML for camera&nbsp;X, don't want to spend a dime, can't code, won't test, and who have no idea of the time, effort, and dedication involved in getting what they want, and who have no intent to help with the process, or any idea just how difficult/impossible the thing they're asking for can be, let alone the internal culture and accepted practices issues of the ML development community (see: <a href=""http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=11080.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tragic Lantern fork thread</a>).</p>

<p>So if you go over to the ML forum to beg someone to make a 750D build&mdash;or even just for feature X&mdash;understand what you're stepping into.  The communication divide gets very frustrating, on both sides.</p>

<p>To put it simply: if you're not going to be part of the solution, then the only thing you can do is wait and hope someone else steps up and does the work.</p>

"DSLR Lens For Close Range Full Body Shots","10241","","<p>I have a Nikon D800 and a 70-120mm zoom lens and a 105mm macro lens.  I am doing portrait photography and I want to be able to take photos at close range (just a few feet away) while still capturing the subject's full body in the photo.  </p>

<p>It seems that the lenses I have only get the face unless I am very far away.  Should I get a wide angle lens?</p>
","<p>Because perspective issues come into play with wider lenses, the normal practice for full body portraits is to use a lens with a <em>normal</em> field of view (FoV). <strong>This will require greater camera to subject distance but will result in a portrait that does not distort the features of the subject.</strong> Both of your lenses are in the beginning of the telephoto range, so a lens in the 40-70mm range, while considered a <em>normal</em> lens, is wider than either of your two lenses. The classic focal length for full body portraits is at around 50mm for a camera using 35mm film or a sensor that is the same size such as your D800.</p>

<p><strong>Remember, perspective is determined by one thing only: shooting distance.</strong> Focal length is only secondary in that it determines the shooting distance for a particular framing. If you are using a 50mm lens on a full frame camera, to get the same subject framing from the <em>same distance</em> you would need to use a 33mm or so lens on an APS-C body. Both lenses will demonstrate the same perspective when used at the same shooting distance. If you used the 50mm lens on the APS-C camera you would need to back up 50% further to obtain the same framing. At that distance, the perspective obtained would be the same as a 75-80mm lens on the full frame camera.</p>

"How much benefit can one expect from a monopod?","10240","","<p>I'm thinking about getting a combined monopod/trekking pole, as I use a trekking pole already and I can't really be bothered to carry a heavy tripod into the hills during daylight. I'm wondering how much difference they make. Is there a rule of thumb such as ""allows 2 stops better than 1 over focal length""?</p>

<p>Also, does lens image stabilisation work with monopods? I believe you should turn it off when using a tripod, but I'm not sure with a monopod. Any ideas?</p>

<p>And as to weight, I have a Canon 40D and often use my 18-200 lens, so I think that makes between 1 and 2kg.</p>
","<p>I was long a user of monopods out in the field. With the advent of image stabilization lenses, I find I almost never haul it out any more. About the only use case I have for it now is when I'm using my 300/1.4x combo with waterbirds or shorebirds, and even then, I'm most likely to either carry the tripod or go handheld. </p>

<p>I see the use case for monopods in two broad areas: the situation above where you want the ability to reposition quickly but want the added stability, or a similar setup where you're shooting sports (baseball or football), especially extended sessions where handholding might cause arm fatigue. The third case (locations like museum where a monopod might be allowed and tripod not...) might make sense in certain special cases. </p>

<p>But in general, improvements in lens speed/quality and IS, and carbon fiber tripods reducing weight, have made monopods a niche tool. lighter tripods means I'm not as likely to choose the monopod as a compromise for weight, and remember you can always just put down one leg of a tripod and use it as a funny looking monopod, but you can't extend the other two legs of a monopod for stability... </p>

<p>In some cases the ""string monopod"" might be a useful alternative, too. use a bolt in the tripod connector (it's a 1/4 20, I believe) and attach a string to it that reachers the ground. then stand on the string and pull up to create tension -- and it'll stabilize the camera. I need to experiment more with this, but unless you are using the monopod to avoid arm fatigue, it seems to give you all the benefits of the monopod for stability, at almost no weight and similar stability improvements.</p>

<p>So for me, it's using IS lenses where possible, and either carrying a tripod or going handheld. monopods just aren't that useful with modern technology. </p>

"What is the EV scale?","10226","","<p>I have seen an ""EV"" (exposure value) scale that's sometimes used to express a camera's exposure settings, or scene brightness. How exactly does this scale work?</p>
","<p>We know that for any scene (really, any light meter measurement) of a particular brightness (and particular sensor sensitivity) there is usually more than one ""correct"" set of shutter speed and aperture settings. A scene that wants f5.6 and 1/125 will also be correctly exposed at f4.0 and 1/250 and so on.</p>

<p>EV numbers are a way to express the brightness of a scene in a scale that combines the shutter speed and aperture settings into one number -- letting the photographer choose what combination of shutter speed and aperture settings to use. Each EV number equals one stop of brightness, so a scene with an EV of 6 is one stop brighter than a scene with an EV of 5.</p>

<p>The EV values are used generally in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To show the sensitivity of the light meter itself or of the autofocus system. Camera specs will often say that the metering system works from EV 0 to 20, or that the camera can autofocus down to an EV of 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Off camera light meters sometimes have a mode that reports in EV, often with a scale so that the photographer can quickly see what shutter speed/aperture combinations are available.</p></li>
<li><p>Especially with off camera spot meters -- to show the difference in the lightest and darkest part of the scene. The photographer would know if he needed fill light to balance the shadows. This is especially from the film days, where you couldn't judge from an LCD when shooting.</p></li>

<p>What could be the difference between my setup and those of the earlier question which worked for the poster?</p>
","<p>It may not possible to do what you want with the D7000 and a wireless remote.

<p>My preferred method for making exposures longer than 30 seconds without touching the camera (any camera with the needed connector) is to use a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001F6TXME"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wired remote</a>.

"Is there any practical difference between saving at 300ppi or 72ppi?","10212","","<p>I often see statements in discussions about web displayed image quality that go something like this: ""I only upload pictures at 72 dpi and 1200 pixels on the long edge, so if someone copies and prints the image it won't look as good as if it were 300 dpi.""</p>

Other than the metadata regarding ppi, is there any difference in the two images at all? If so, what is the difference? If I tell my printer to print the images at 4R (4X6 inches) will there be any difference at all in how the printer creates a print from the 1200x800 @ 300 dpi image versus the 1200x800 @ 72 dpi image?</p>
","<p>You ask if there is a <strong>practical difference</strong>. So the answer is yes, albeit a very small one, but some of the other answers have missed it.</p>

<p>You're right that the only difference is in the metadata: if you save the same image as 300dpi and 72dpi the pixels are exactly the same, only the EXIF data embedded in the image file is different. (I've even verified this using a Beyond Compare, a file comparison tool.) <strong>If you open the two images on screen you will see absolutely no difference between them.</strong></p>

<p>However, now drag and drop those two images into a word processor and you should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oB0TD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Page-setting software like InDesign does the same thing. This is because in both cases the target environment is one that measures things in real-world units (centimetres or inches), so it uses the dpi metadata to decide how to convert your image's pixel dimensions to real-world dimensions. For example, a 600x600-pixel image at 300dpi will appear on the page at 2x2 inches.</p>

<p>By contrast, most screen-based environments (Photoshop, the web, etc.) measure things in pixels so no conversion is needed: each pixel in your image simply occupies one pixel of your screen.</p>

<p>So, if you're preparing an image for print on paper or other physical media and you're asked for a specific dpi (which will usually be 300), you should stick to it to ease the workflow at the print end. (Of course, a page designer can always convert your 72dpi image to 300dpi without losing anything, but why make things difficult?) <strong>Note that this only ever applies if your image is going to be <em>placed on a page</em></strong> (for example, in a magazine or book), which is why it so rarely makes a difference. If you're just printing photos full-page (either on your own printer or sending off for photographic prints) the dpi will make no difference.</p>

"What is bokeh, exactly?","10169","","<p>I understand that ""bokeh"" refers to out-of-focus areas of an image — but there is obviously more to it than that. What does the term mean exactly? How well is bokeh really understood? Is it purely subjective, or can it be evaluated, measured, classified? And how can bokeh be compared and contrasted in different lenses?</p>
","<p>Most importantly: <strong>It's not just the disks rendered from a point source</strong>, even though that's the simplest way to describe it and see it.  The disk is just a shorthand; the lens characteristics that produce these disks are always present; they're what determines the look of the out-of-focus areas in every photo you take!</p>

<p>On the one hand, it's quite well-understood in that cause and effect are fairly well known.  On the other hand, what makes one type ""good"" or ""bad"" is (as with so many things) extremely subjective and sensitive to context.  The general consensus is that good bokeh renders a smooth background without artifacts, but like so many other things, it's possible to make a good picture with ""bad"" bokeh; it might even be a good picture <em>because</em> of 'bad' bokeh, like the examples with shaped apertures.</p>

<p><strong>Shape:</strong> The shape of the disk is determined by the shape of the aperture, and is well-described in other answers (though see also the note on 'distortion' below).</p>

<p><strong>Brightness:</strong> The brightness across the disk is influenced by other aspects of the lens, primarily its degree of spherical aberration.  There are three basic situations, simulated here: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4HrhY.jpg"" alt=""bokeh""></p>

<p>In the centre is what you get from a perfectly-corrected lens (or close to it): a disk evenly lit from edge to edge – this is the situation in a large number of modern lenses.</p>

<p>On the left is ""smooth"" bokeh: a bright centre with a gradual fall-off towards the edge.  This is what's generally considered to be desirable, as it blends smoothly and eliminates hard edges in the background.</p>

<p>On the right is what I call ""bright-line"" bokeh; a bright exterior that fades towards the centre.  I'll emphasise that while you get a similar ""doughnut"" shape from catadioptric lenses, you can see this bright-line effect in many other lenses as well to a lesser degree. Classicaly, this is the less-desirable kind of bokeh, as it will emphasise edges in the background, sometimes to the extent of rendering them as parallel lines.</p>

<p>When you get each type depends largely on spherical aberration, with the background rendering being most important:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Under-corrected lenses will typically exhibit smooth bokeh in the background, with the bright-edged type in the foreground.  Many of the classic portrait lenses are deliberately designed this way, and it's also what's largely responsible for the very smooth ""creamy"" look of many older lens designs like the Zeiss Sonnar or Voigtländer Heliar.</p></li>
<li><p>Over-corrected spherical aberration will produce the opposite; a smoother bokeh in front of the plane of focus, the harsher one behind.  This is often a characteristic of lenses that are both fast <em>and</em> sharp, like many 50mm f/1.4 designs, as well as some macro designs (where sharpness is at a priority).  While this type of bokeh might be the classically ""bad"" one, the effect is not usually extreme, and other characteristics of the lens can more than make up for it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Distortion</strong>: Ideally, all disks would be round and a similar shape, but various other aspects of the lens will stretch them to ovals (astigmatism, field curvature), create small tails (coma), or there may even be mechanical obstructions that cut off edges.  All of these tend to be much more obvious as you move towards the edge of the frame.</p>

<p><strong>Color</strong>: Chromatic aberrations will colour the disk; lateral chromatic aberrations will create the familiar magenta/green fringing, and longitudinal chromatic aberration will cause a slight colour cast over the entire area of the disk, which will be a different colour in front of the plane of focus than behind.</p>

Almost universal usage is that this is the ratio between the maximum and minimum focal lengths available from the lens.  </p>

"What does ""frequency"" mean in an image?","10128","","<p>I don't understand how frequencies are defined in images/photographs. As far as I understand it now, high frequencies are like sharp things in images, like edges or so, and low frequencies are kind of the opposite?</p>

<p>I also would like to understand the outcome of Discrete Fourier Transformations, like how to read them properly. </p>

<p>It would be cool if somebody could explain to me the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are frequencies in pictures and how are they defined?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you read the outcome of a Discrete Fourier Transformation?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>I will only answer the first question: <strong>What are frequencies in images?</strong></p>

<p>Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique where the same image information is represented not for each pixel separately but rather for each frequency. Think about it this way. The sea has waves some of which are very slow moving (like tides), others are medium in size and still some others are tiny like the ripples formed from a gust. You can think of them as three separate waves but at each point on the surface of the sea and a moment in time, you get just one height of water.</p>

<p>The same applies to images. You can think of the image being made up of various waves or frequencies. To create your image, start with the average colour (actually thinking of gray scale images is easier). Then add waves of different wave lengths and strength to slowly build up details in the picture. </p>

<p>Source Image:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SisLI.jpg"" alt=""Source Image""></p>

<p>First Frequency (Average):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JptIb.jpg"" alt=""Average""></p>

<p>The second frequency along the vertical dimension is a wave starting at zero at the bottom of the image, rising, becoming zero again along the centred horizon and falling below zero to finally become zero at the top of the image. (I described a Fourier Series without phase shift, but the analogy still holds.) </p>

<p>Here you can see the second frequency along the horizontal, vertical and diagonal. Notice that you can make out where the mountain will be (dark) and where the sky and lake will be (lighter). </p>

<p>Second Frequency:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EYdz8.jpg"" alt=""First Component""></p>

<p>Each additional wave or frequency brings along more ripples and as such, more detail. To get different images, the wave height/amplitude can be changed as well as the starting point of the wave, also called the Phase. </p>

<p>Third Frequency:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yl5KC.jpg"" alt=""Third""></p>

<p>Interestingly, the information amount is the same in this representation and one can go back and forth between normal images (spatial domain) and Fourier Transformed images (frequency domain). In the frequency domain we need to keep information of all frequencies along with the amplitude and the phase information. </p>

<p>Here it is using 50% of the frequencies:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tg3jK.jpg"" alt=""50%""></p>

<p>There are variants of all this, with distinctions to be made among Fourier Series, Fourier Transform and Discrete Fourier Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT).</p>

<p>One interesting application is in the use of compression algorithms like JPEG. Here the DCT is used to save more of the important parts of the image (the low frequencies) and less of the high frequencies. </p>

<p>I wrote this in the hope that novice readers can get a basic understanding of the idea of Fourier Transforms. For that I made some simplifications that I hope the more advanced readers will forgive me.</p>

<h1>Usage of Frequencies in Post-Processing</h1>

<p>There are numerous methods that rely on frequencies for post processing, mostly because we never look at single pixels individually. Many algorithms work on frequency because it is more natural to think about them this way. But also because the Fourier Transform contains the same information we can express any mathematical operation (or post processing step) in the frequency and the spatial domains! Sometimes the pixel-wise description is better but often the frequency description is better. (Better primarily means faster in this context.)</p>

<p>One technique I would like to point for no particular reason except that it is artists working directly with frequencies and that is *frequency separation *. I am not going to describe it but you can see how it works on YouTube for both Photoshop and GIMP.</p>

<p>You create two layers one with the low frequencies and one with the high frequencies. For portraits you can do skin smoothing on the high frequencies without affecting the skin tones in the low frequencies. </p>

"50mm stuck on the body","10126","","<p>I have the Canon 600D and the ""nifty fifty"" 50mm f/1.8 that cost around 100$.
One day when I was trying to switch lenses, I pressed on the lens release button, started twisting the 50mm, and around 1/4 of the way the lens got stuck. Now I can't pull out the lens and I'm afraid to twist it harder. I did some research and I can't find any way to fix it, so I went to the local photography shop and the offer that they gave me was $130, which is more than the cost of the lens itself!</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can get this lens off without breaking it?</p>
","<p>This may help. It's not exactly what you wanted to hear but it's probably better than what the camera shop has advised.</p>

<p><a href=""http://500px.com/David_Epperly/stories/22176/how-to-remove-a-stuck-canon-50mm-1-8-lens-from-your-camera"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>How to remove a stuck Canon 50mm 1.8 lens from your camera</strong></a></p>

<p>Note that this <strong>may not</strong> be what has happened in your case, but it sounds very similar.<br>
He says - </p>

<ul>
<li>What happens is that there is a snap on plastic dust cover on the mount end of the lens. The dust cover is basically a plastic ring with four fingers that snap into the back of the lens housing. The cover encompasses the inner lens and also surrounds the electrical connections on three sides. Hopefully you are starting to get a picture of the part I am talking about. What happens is that one or more of the fingers that snaps into the back of the lens breaks allowing the dust cover to fall slightly back towards the camera body. When you go to rotate the lens to remove it the lens only rotates maybe one quarter of a turn and will not rotate any more. The plastic dust cover has snagged on the cameras electrical connection. </li>
</ul>

<p>His fix is potentially destructive of the lens and not of the camera if care is taken. There is a possibility of saving the lens - and more so if you understand properly in advance what you are setting out to do, what is involved, why it works and what damage is likely. So read the (short) article carefully first. If you are not confident with your mechanical competence you could consider showing this 'fix' to a person who is used to fine mechanical work and ask them to try. I'd expect that a competent ""watchmaker"" would be likely to do this successfully.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is also possible that, if this is what is wrong in your case, you may be able to plan an ""attack"" from the outside with pieces of material that allow you to attack the jamming points - perhaps mylar sheet or steel or brass shim material that you can cut ""fingers from to slide into the lens-body interface. A mechanical ""feeler gauge"" set may provide suitable material. If trying this method, take the camera battery out first. Bearing in mind, of course, that damage to the lens is potentially acceptable but that damage to the camera is to be avoided. </p>

<p>If I was attempting this I'd read as many of the descriptions of the frontal attack method that I could find and look at the photos (see 'useful page' below) and THEN see if a feeler gauge attack may be able to be planned. That's just me, and you may be better advised to not even try this. If it does work it probably has more chance of actually recovering the lens than the other approaches. But, who knows what you might do to the camera in the process?</p>

<hr>

<p>As a warning about brute force, he also notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some people said to just twist hard and the lens should break and come off. Others said that they twisted hard and the lens came off but it wiped out the camera side of the mount, meaning the electrical connection pins. The local camera repair shop had no idea what I was talking about so I decided to give it a go on my own.</li>
</ul>

"Which cameras can sync at faster than 1/250?","10107","","<p>I am told that certain (mostly older) DSLRs can sync (i.e. successfully work with flash) at shutter speeds faster than 1/250 of a second.  </p>

<p>Which makes / models can do this?  </p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<ol>
<li>Thank you for all your answers.  Fantastic.  Keep them coming. </li>
<li>I am asking this because I want to be able to have more control of ambient light.</li>
<li>I don't really care how a camera manages to sync at a higher speed - just the effect.  (Some people seem to think I am only asking about electronic shutters, but I'm not: high speed sync is a great answer, as is anything else, no matter how esoteric).  </li>
</ol>
","<p>Firstly it's important to know why sync speed exists, basically when you use a shutter speed faster than the nominal ""sync speed"" the shutter starts to close at the bottom before it's fully open at the top. Thus at no single instant in time is the shutter fully open so if you fire a flash part of the image will be dark. For most DSLRs this speed is 1/250s. </p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to exceed the 1/250s with flash. You can make the shutter move faster so it exposes the whole frame at once even at high speeds, or you can use electronics shutter to turn the sensor on and off simulating an infinitely fast mechanical shutter.</p>

<p>I think whoever mentioned fast sync with old DSLRs was referring to electronic shutters, as these are no longer used on DSLRs (but are still found on compacts). Reasons for the demise of electronic shutters on DSLRs are varied and there's little consensus though issues with image quality and consistency are often cited. </p>

<p>Even if you're using a mechanical shutter you can sneak past the manufacturer stated sync speed by timing the flash very carefully. The ""Hyper sync"" function on new Pocket Wizards allows you to tune the flash delay for this purpose. </p>

<p>Here's a summary of the methods and speeds you can expect in practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast focal plane shutter (available on some film SLRs) <strong>1/350s</strong> </li>
<li>Focal plane shutter + careful timing (with pocketwizards) <strong>1/400s</strong></li>
<li>Leaf shutters (found in some medium and large format lenses) <strong>1/800</strong></li>
<li>Electronic shutters (found in older mostly Nikon DSLRs) <strong>1/1000s*</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>*Technically you can sync at any speed with an electronic shutter, however past 1/1000 the shutter duration is usually shorter than the flash duration so you start to lose power which halts your ability to overpower ambient.</p>

<p>The only models of DSLR I'm aware of with electronic shutters are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikon D1</li>
<li>Nikon D1X</li>
<li>Nikon D1H</li>
<li>Nikon D70</li>
<li>Nikon D70s</li>
<li>Nikon D50 </li>
<li>Nikon D40</li>
<li>Canon 1D</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure someone here can fill any blanks from the other major manufacturers. It seems the only model from Canon with an electronic shutter is the original 1D, which is an ancient beast, though the newer 1D models can sync above 1/250s with mechanical shutters.</p>

<p>So in summary there are cameras with faster mechanical shutters / leaf shutters that can beat 1/250s but not by much. If you want crazy sync speeds electronic shutter is the way to go.</p>

But why are grey cards used instead of pure white ones? </p>

<p>My assumptions:
Is a specific greytone easier to produce than pure white?
Does white stain so much easier? (or Does grey just doesn't show stains that much?)</p>
","<p>When you have already set your exposure parameters, white could be clipped in some single color channel (but not all, so your camera won't show it as blown), therefore not being very good basis for color balance adjustment.</p>

<p>Also, paper will turn yellow during time. And just looking at the sheets currently on my desk, there's three different tones of white papers already.</p>

<p>That said, I've used white paper many times and it will get you close enough in all but very critical studio shoots. Very often you'll have multiple different light sources,  reflections from colored surfaces and/or shadows vs. lit areas, all having much more impact on colors than slight imperfection in metering the white balance. Just make sure you don't clip any color channels (e.g. by spot metering without compensation from the paper, or verifying exposure parameters using color channel histograms).</p>

"What is ideal distance to subject for head and shoulder portraits?","10042","","<p>Perspective is a matter of distance and has an effect on facial features and the observed three-dimensional feeling in a two-dimensional photograph. Proper lighting is a big part of this, but that's another question. First I'd choose the distance between camera and subject. I prefer close-up portraits that show only the head and partial shoulder, if even that much. How close to my subject should I go to have natural facial proportions, given that I have a choise with it? Not talking about candid photos taken at opportunity.</p>

<p>My problem is that I don't feel comfortable to be at so short distance to a person I'm photographing. If the situation allows I want to be several meters away from subject, but then with too long distance the result is a ""flat"" face.</p>

<p>In a portrait photo we <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/15741/17441"">use distance</a> between camera and the subject in such way to create a pleasing and hopefully natural looking perspective. I like a pretty <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syO9F.jpg?s=128&amp;g=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tight crop</a> of only face, neck and usually only one shoulder fully inside frame, sometimes not even that much. I believe it is priority to be at the right distance, and secondary to choose the right focal length of lens. I hope I'm clear enough that I am <strong>not</strong> asking for <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/916/17441"">recommendations</a> for lens focal lengths. This question is about the distance between camera and subject's face.</p>

<p>At what distance do experienced portrait photographers take their head and shoulder shots?</p>
","<p>This is a good question but many of the existing answers seem really convoluted and off the point.</p>

<p><strong>All that matters is distance to the subject</strong>, as this is what defines the distortions of facial features. </p>

<p>Focal length is a secondary issue. If you use a wide angle lens, and you are at an optimal distance for a good portrait, you get a lot of the background included in the image. You can crop this image to get the similar field of view as with a zoom lens. You choose a longer focal length to increase bokeh and sharpness that would be lost by cropping the image in post processing.</p>

<p>The optimal length depends on the facial features as some faces seem more pleasing if they are more flat and others seem better if a bit nearer. My experience is that <strong>the distance providing most natural photos is between 1.5 meters (5 feet) and 4 meters (13 feet)</strong>. The flattening above 4 meters can provide an artistic view, but going below 1.5 meters will give you distortions that won't seem natural.</p>

<p>Case in point, I added a quick set of images of my face that seems to look really flat and unatural already starting at 4m due to my facial features. Photos are taken with a canon L zoom lens with a set focal length and aperture (ie. photos are cropped).</p>

"What is a ""small"" aperture?","10000","","<p>It happens a lot. People refer to the aperture being small (or big!). By default does this imply a small opening of the iris (literal aperture), or a small f-value (how the aperture is measured, for which the value gets bigger as the iris gets smaller)?</p>
","<p>Unless there's further context about physical size, ""small aperture"" almost always means a higher f-number. This is also, of course, a smaller physical size for a given lens relative to wider apertures.</p>

<p>A small aperture means a <em>high</em> f number, like f/22 or f/32. Where one draws the line is open to interpretation, and to context. A small aperture is also called <em>slow</em> (because it lets in less light, requiring a longer shutter speed to compensate).</p>

<p>This means that a ""smaller f-number"" where the <em>number</em> is low is a <em>larger</em> aperture, not a smaller one. That's a bit confusing, so really it's better to avoid ""small"" and ""large"" (or ""high"" and ""low"") altogether and talk about ""fast"" and ""slow"".</p>

<p>Charts like the one above used to come with cameras, usually along with suggestions for lighting conditions appropriate for each.

","<p>I think the word you're looking for is ""saturated"". In any case, this looks to me like it was taken with a fairly wide-angle lens from quite close up (note the rather exaggerated perspective of the tray). The saturated colors are largely a result of fairly careful lighting, in this case from the right of the camera.</p>

<p>Especially if you're accustomed to on-camera flash, this can make a big difference. On-camera flash tends to show quite a few specular highlights. Since (by definition) a specular highlight doesn't show color, a lot of them have a tendency to give washed-out looking colors. Moving the flash 30-45 degrees (or so) away from the lens axis eliminates (or at least hides) a lot of those specular highlights, so you get much more saturated colors.</p>

<p>The circle you see is the Sun :|. When I was taking this picture, I was in <code>Live-View</code> Mode with <code>F/22</code> and no <code>UV</code> Filter.
You think it's dangerous for my camera?</p>

<p>I've used <strong><code>Canon 60D</code></strong> with <strong><code>Canon 50mm 1.4</code></strong> Lens</p>
","<p>The problem with doing what you did in Live View is that even though you are taking the photo at f/22, the aperture of your lens is likely at f/1.4 until you click the shutter. The energy of the sun is strong enough when focused by your lens to heat the internals of your camera very quickly. If things get hot enough, they will be damaged. Even if the heat doesn't cause damage, the voltages generated in the sensor's electronics may be enough to damage the circuitry. Thank goodness this camera wasn't in Live View with the shutter curtains open for the 1 minute it took the <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Help/Flare.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sun to do this</a> through a 600mm lens during a flare test, during which the sun was just out of the frame but obviously just inside the lens' image circle, by Bryan at <a href=""http://www.the-digital-picture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The-Digital-Picture</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The warnings almost all camera's manuals have against pointing the lens directly at the sun are there for a reason, and it isn't just so you can't blame the manufacturer when something goes wrong.</strong> Especially when the sun is almost directly overhead in a clear sky, the chance of damage is very real. The lower the sun is in the sky, the more clouds there are between the sun and your shooting location, or the more anything else (such as a filter) is absorbing some of the sun's energy the less likely it is that short periods of pointing your camera at the sun will result in damage. This is why it is fairly safe to take sunrise/sunset photos: due to the sun's angle it is passing trough many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when it is high in the sky.</p>

<p>Your photo appears to have been taken when fairly thick clouds were absorbing a lot of the sun's energy. Even then, it would probably have been better in terms of risk to the camera to take the photo using normal shooting mode, when the shutter curtains protect the sensor until after the lens is stopped down to take the shot, than to use Live View which exposes to sensor to all of that energy with the aperture wide open both before and after the shot when the lens is briefly stopped down. Just be sure to protect your eyesight and do not look at the sun through the viewfinder at all when it is at or near full brightness high in the sky!</p>

"Are there any downsides to using a good-quality UV filter?","9953","","<p>Are there any <em><strong>real</strong></em> downsides to using a UV filter?</p>

<p>I know that a poor quality UV filter can effect image quality ... but, assuming I use a good quality UV filter, will that actually be an issue? Is there any other reason not to use one?</p>
","<p>Yes.</p>

<ul>
<li>It degrades image quality - adding more elements to a lens <em>always</em> reduces image quality; better filters will just do so less. One specific thing that happens is light reflecting between the front element of the lens and the filter, which can be reduced (but not eliminated) with coatings on the filter.</li>
<li>It makes it more difficult to use other filters. Either you have to remove it before adding the other filter, or you have to stack, which can introduce vignetting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether the IQ reduction is noticeable and/or whether this is a good tradeoff is another question. :)</p>

<p>In portraits they say that it is important to keep focus on both eyes (ruling off f/1.4).<br>
In moving subjects (street photography) it s simply not possible to focus with f/1.4.<br>
In food photos it will then focus only a particle of food.</p>

<p>What are the <em>PRACTICAL</em> uses of f/1.4?</p>
","<p>I use wide open apertures like this very often. It all depends on your style of shooting. You specifically said that portraits might not work well with this aperture. I disagree. Some examples of when I use it include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indoors available light portraits</li>
<li>When I have distracting backgrounds and want to emphasize the subject and not the surroundings</li>
<li>When I need a fast shutter speed but the lighting is not bright enough to facilitate at a smaller aperture, ie toddlers running around indoors</li>
<li>When shooting indoor detail shots at a wedding, such as flowers, rings, cakes, etc.</li>
<li>When I want to highlight detail in a portrait such as an earing, lipstick, hair, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind, f/1.4 is perfectly useable at a safe distance. If you are right on top of your subject, yes the DOF will be razor thin, but from a distance it is less difficult to be right on with focus.</p>

<p>Also, should I consider a muslin?</p>

<p>What are some things I should look for in a background for a home setup? I want a full-length backdrop which includes something to stand on, so I can get full body shots including shoes.</p>
","<p>Any of them are going to work fine for a home studio, presuming you have the space to set things up. Some things to consider, however, are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stands to hold the backdrop. It may seem a little obvious, but if you want to have flexibility in your use of backdrops, at least a basic stand is going to be something to get.</p></li>
<li><p>Reuse of the backdrop(s). Fancier ones, with special designs and images, are probably going to get less reuse for non-professional work unless you want all your portraits to have much the same look and feel. Basic ones, in colours such as black, white, etc. are probably going to see a lot of usage because they are flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper has the advantage of being low cost and, in some ways, low maintenance, but eventually you run out and have to replace it, but being paper you can actually do a lot of stuff to it (like paint it, draw on it, etc.). Fabric, on the other hand, has to be cleaned and maintained, but is going to last, and you can adjust the drap to create depth or additional texture. Either option, by the way, will allow for people to stand on it, it's the length that matters there.</p></li>
<li><p>Your space. Background widths vary, so do you have room for 8' or 5' or more or less? No point in getting a backdrop you can't fit in the space. Same goes for ceiling height, you don't want the stand top in the shot.</p></li>
<li><p>Lighting. If you're working with a basic one light setup, you may end up not even seeing the background in the result! Especially true of on camera flash, which is the worst option for this kind of shooting. So, do you have the means to light the subject and the background? It's a consideration, I wouldn't invest a lot in a background I won't even see in the shot.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want to do chromakey (green/blue screen) so you can do background replacement? Cloth may be the best way to go there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are probably a ton more considerations, but I think answering many of these will help you pick better options. Bear in mind, it's not as if you're stuck with paper or cloth, you can do both and both have their places.</p>

<p>DIY is possible, to some degree, mostly around the <a href=""http://www.diyphotography.net/homestudio/blz/home-made-cheap-diy-backdrop-stand"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stands</a> and basic lighting. For fabric or paper, you're buying unless you have your own paper or textile mill. Now, you can get fabric from a lot of places, but large wide panels are much harder to find at consumer oriented fabric shops (I know, I've tried). You can sew panels together, but doing that seamlessly would be a serious challenge. All in all, in my own attempts, I just came to the conclusion that it's a lot less effort to just get it from a photography store.</p>

"What is the relationship between focal length and shutter speed?","9914","","<p>I am very new to photography and am trying to grasp the basics of it these days. Can someone please help me understand the relationship between focal length of a lens and shutter speed of camera?</p>
","<p>There is no direct relation between the two. However, there is an observation that with longer focal length you need faster shutter (keeping ISO the same) in order to avoid blur from <em>camera shake</em>. Quoting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rule of thumb for a sharp picture, free from the effects of camera
  shake, is to use a shutter speed which is at least as fast as 1
  divided by the focal length of the lens. So if you are using your zoom
  set at 100mm you should use a shutter speed of at least 1/100 of a
  second. If you are using a 50mm lens you will get a sharp picture at
  1/50th of a second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this rule is modified by VR (vibration reduction), and similar solutions, so you gain a few stops so your shutter speed can be decreased by that.</p>

<p>This rule does not apply if the camera is on a tripod, or you have a steady hand, etc.</p>

<p>It also does not help removing blur from people moving, etc.</p>

"How can a 18-55mm lens focus on objects beyond 55mm?","9890","","<p>I guess this is a total noob question, but doesn't 18-55mm mean that it can focus only up to 55mm?</p>
","<p>There is a fairly simple explanation here: <a href=""http://www.paragon-press.com/lens/lenchart.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.paragon-press.com/lens/lenchart.htm</a></p>

<p>To summarize from that site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply put, the focal length of a lens
  is the distance from the lens to the
  sensor, when focused on a subject at
  infinity. To focus on something closer
  than infinity, the lens is moved
  farther away from the sensor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Focal length</em> and <em>focus distance</em> are two different things.</p>

<p><strong>Focal length</strong> controls the viewing angle, essentially meaning how much of the scene the camera can see. A large focal length means the camera sees only a narrow view of the world, which makes faraway objects look bigger. A small focal length, on the other hand, means the camera can see a wide view of the world. Objects appear smaller because lots of things get squeezed into the picture.</p>

<p><strong>Focus distance</strong> is controlled by moving the lens further away from the sensor, so that the light rays from a single point on an object nearby converge to form a point of light on the sensor. If a 55mm lens were 55mm from the sensor, only objects infinitely or very far away would be in focus. To bring a scene into focus, the lens must be moved away from the sensor until all the rays of light converge to form distinct points. This is why almost every lens can focus on distant objects, but macro lenses (which focus on very close objects) are more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>How can I calculate the time at which the sun will appear and disappear based a date, location and altitude?</strong></p>

<p>Low altitude do not make much difference but as I'll be between 3000m and 4500m above sea-level started next week, there may be a significant offset. The linked question mentions about one hour but does not mention at which altitude.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://photoephemeris.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Photographer's Ephemeris</a> is a great software package to get started with these sorts of calculations.  There is a free desktop version that you can use at home before your trip, and if it turns out to be really helpful, there are paid versions available for iOS and Android.</p>

<p>This tool lets you mark a spot on a map and then calculate sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset for any day you choose.  The vectors of these events are shown as colored rays on the map, and the times and moon-phase are shown, as well.  As the question indicates, sunrise and sunset calculations depend, among other things, on elevation, and TPE can help with this.  The mapping tools are aware of elevation, and based on various entries in the <a href=""http://photoephemeris.com/tpe-desktop-release-notes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">release notes</a>, it appears that altitude is accounted for in its calculations.</p>

<p>Per some of the comments on this and others' answers, though, another factor is at work in practical instances -- the obscured horizon.  In the simplest case, you'll have an unobscured view of the horizon:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6JHcx.jpg"" alt=""Flat Horizon""></p>

<p>In practice, however, very few of the really interesting landscapes feature perfectly flat horizons, so we'd ideally like to take into account the elevation and distance of those obstructions, as well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/takSZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Although TPE (to the best of my knowledge) won't account for all of the objects that might obscure the horizon for you, it does have some features that might help to an extent.  There's an ability to set a secondary location on the map and compute the distance, bearing, apparent altitude change, and elevation change to that location.  So long as you know that this is where your apparent horizon really is, you can plug this elevation back into TPE, which will calculate its effect on events.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p2Lzn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, there's a bit of a knack to really getting the most out of TPE, but there are some great <a href=""http://photoephemeris.com/tutorials/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorials</a> that walk you through scenarios like this.</p>

"Is a macro lens suitable for distant subjects - wildlife, sports, portraiture?","9885","","<p>Some macro lenses have a really nice focal length that would make them a nice prime-telephoto lens, but are there any downsides of using a macro lens when shooting distant subjects (besides the lack of zooming)?</p>
","<p>Most prime <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2149/what-is-a-macro-lens"">macro lenses</a> are suitable for distant subjects. However, there are some exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the king of macro photography, Canon MP-E 65, will not focus far enough to fit more than an eye or nose on a portrait;</p></li>
<li><p>some macro lenses, like Pentax DA 35 Limited Macro, have a short focal length -suitable for distant subjects only as <em>environmental</em> shots showing context rather than details of the subject; shorter than about 50mm on APS-C or 75mm on full frame are generally not considered suitable as <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/13636/what-is-a-portrait-lens"">portrait lens</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>some zoom lenses are also sold as ""macro"" lenses; generally they have a variable aperture similar to consumer zooms. You can take portraits with them, but you have to use other tricks to get a good background separation (e.g. background far away, plain background, lighting subject to underexpose background).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Macro lenses are made to be comfortable for precise manual focusing (because that's how macro is mostly done), so their large focusing range is spread over almost a full turn of focusing ring. This implies that <strong>auto-focus</strong> can be a bit <strong>slow</strong>, especially if there's no focus range limit switch and the lens goes hunting through the whole range. Prefocusing to an approximate distance might help you here in many cases.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage in using macro lenses compared to a regular primes lens is their <strong>moderate maximum aperture</strong> for a prime of similar focal length (especially ones preferred for low-light, fast action or portraiture), usually in range of f/2.8 to f/4.5 - for macro, more would be overkill. Tamron 60mm f/2.0 is a surprising exception here; unfortunately 60mm has to be so close to subject it will scare away living critters, also lighting becomes challenging; so it has somewhat limited use in macro world.</p>

<p>The smaller aperture means less flexibility in getting thin depth of field. But small maximum aperture means the aperture for maximum sharpness is even slower (typically by a stop or two), meaning you have to take harder compromises between sharpness and background separation by DOF.</p>

<p>That said, an f/2.8 macro lens is still on par with professional zooms aperture-wise.</p>

"Why do people recommend 50mm or other prime lenses as starting lenses for learning photography?","9864","","<p>I've seen quite a few people recommend the 50mm prime lenses, in particular the sub-$100 50mm/f1.8, as a starting lens for photographers (especially because they're likely to be using cameras with cropped sensors). From my experiences with the 18-55 mm kit lens (on a Canon EOS 550D), it seems that 50mm is not really very suited for indoor flashless group photographs where the wide aperture would be helpful. It is probably a good lens for portraits of one or two persons, and some low light photographs.</p>

<p>So, what are the advantages it offers over the kit zoom lenses (apart from the wider aperture), under what scenarios is it more useful, and why would you recommend it as a starting lens?</p>
","<p>What people have generally suggested is to start with a <strong>normal</strong> lens. On a full-frame 35mm camera, that role was generally filled by the 50mm lens. On a modern crop-frame DSLR, it would be closer to 30mm (for Canon APS-C 1.6x sensors) or 35mm (Nikon, Pentax, Sony) or 25mm (Olympus and Panasonic).</p>

<p>The 50mm is usually suggested these days as the first good supplement to the kit lens. It doesn't really matter whose 50mm lens you're looking at, the design for the f/1.8 (or f/1.7) version has been around forever. They're all sharp to <em>very</em> sharp, lightweight and (most of all) <em>cheap</em>. And as you pointed out, they'll function well as a shortish version of the traditional medium telephoto portrait lens. But as nice as the ""nifty fifty"" is, it's not a normal lens on a crop-sensor camera.</p>

<p>A normal prime lens is very versatile. You can step back a couple of feet and get a fairly wide image field. Step forward and you can fill the frame with a single subject of interest. Neither picture will be quite what you'd get using a wide angle lens or a short telephoto, but you <em>can</em> get a reasonably good picture either way. The field of view subjectively matches what you tend to think you're seeing in real life, so there are no major surprises or unintentional special effects.</p>

<p>Working with a prime lens, though, helps you to become a better photographer. It forces you to change your point of view to find the best image rather than just standing in the easiest spot and turning a ring. You might get acceptable results using a zoom exclusively, but it's unlikely you'll get a spectacular result until you've forced yourself to take the rocky road for a while. You may decide to stick with primes (I have always had zooms, and shot an average of ten rolls of film a day -- or the equivalent -- for a couple of decades, and I bet I took fewer than two hundred shots with a zoom lens in all that time) but even if you use a zoom lens most of the time, you'll never use it in quite the same way after working exclusively with prime lenses long enough to change your habits.</p>

<p>So, why do pro-sumer and professional cameras (for the most part) use only Compact Flash (CF) memory?  Is it a performance, reliability or durability issue?</p>
","<p>Initially the reason was performance and capacity. A lot of the pro-level cameras went CF because you needed the performance and, usually because a pro shoots RAW, the capacity which the original SD couldn't match. Not to mention there was a point in time where SD was more expensive as a result of volume sales differences. SD is now cheaper thanks in a big way to the proliferation of small devices that used them such as point and shoot cameras, media players, etc.</p>

<p>Anyways, the speed/capacity issues largely evaporated with SDHC and will evaporate with SDXC. Then I think you will see a big move, in fact the shift is already happening without SDXC support in any camera. Canon's 1Ds as noted, but even Pentax stayed SDHC with the 645D medium format and that is miles away from a consumer camera. Also what we are starting to see is dual card support because SD cards are nice and small, that's a nice thing to have and impractical with CF. </p>

"Why don't digital cameras shoot video at full sensor resolution, or do continuous drive at video framerates?","9815","","<p>Why do high resolution cameras shoot stills at high resolutions, but only typically shoot video at 1080p which is about 2 megapixels?</p>

  <p>For example I have a Sony-NEX 6 which can shoot stills at 16
  megapixels but only 1080p by 1920p video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several reasons why most high resolution still cameras that also shoot video don't produce video at the same resolution, and why they can't maintain the same frame rates when shooting high resolution stills that they use when shooting video.</p>

<ul>
<li>By far the biggest issue is the amount of data produced for a given amount of time. Since a 20MP JPEG saved with a low compression rate is typically 10 times the size of a single 1080p HD video frame, and a 20MP RAW file will be 2-3 times the size of the JPEG, that means that 20-30 HD video frames are roughly the same size as a single 20MP RAW file. To put it another way, you can store an entire second's worth of HD video in the same space as ONE 20MP RAW file.</li>
<li>The data coming off the sensor must be interpreted by the camera's processor. Like all other digital processors, each camera is limited by how fast the CPU can crunch the numbers. Increasing the data rate of the processor 20 fold would be prohibitively expensive, and create the need for cooling systems too large to fit in a DSLR sized package.</li>
<li>Current write speeds of even the fastest UHS-1 SD cards and UDMA-8 CF cards could not keep up with a data rate high enough to record 30 fps of 20MP RAW files.</li>
<li>When shooting still images, most cameras pause to recalculate things like focus and exposure between each frame. With a DSLR, this also requires the reflex-mirror to cycle down and back up between each frame, and the lens to open to maximum aperture between each shot. The highest end FF DSLRs can do all of this at frame rates of 10-12 fps! Lower cost DSLRs typically shoot at 3-5 fps. But they can only maintain that pace for a few seconds before the rate of transferring all of those bits to a memory card forces them to wait for space in the buffer memory to clear.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also how do digital cameras separate the frames in video if the lens shutter never closes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no mechanical shutter on the lenses of your Sony NEX-6. There is a mechanical two curtain focal plane shutter in front of the sensor assembly inside the camera's body. Depending on the settings you have selected, it normally operates as the same type of shutter does on a DSLR or even old film camera when you are shooting still images. The pixel sites on your sensor are energized just before the first curtain opens until shortly after the second curtain closes. The amount of time the sensor is energized and collecting light can be anywhere from a tad longer than the flash sync speed of 1/160 second to the maximum 30 second exposure time, or even longer when using Bulb mode.</p>

<p>When you are shooting video, the shutter stays open and the amount of light collected by each pixel site are read out to the processor at specific intervals, the 'counter' for each pixel is reset to zero and the pixel starts counting the number of photons that strike it again. CMOS sensors recording in 1080P (the <em>p</em> is for <em>progressive</em>) read each pixel site from the top to bottom of the frame in sequence, then start over at the top for the next frame. Older Standard Definition and 720i cameras read the odd numbered lines from top to bottom, then go back and read the even numbered lines (The <em>i</em> in 720i stands for <em>interlaced</em>). Higher end CCD sensors read the entire sensor at the same instant, dump that data to an on sensor buffer, and begin collecting more light while the data from the previous frame is sent to the camera's processor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if you can shoot video at 30 fps or 60 fps then why can't cameras have a continuous drives at 30 to 60 fps?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some do, but any priced at consumer levels are limited when shooting such high frame rates to lower resolutions similar to the resolution of HD video (30 fps) or even lower resolution (60fps), and they are also limited to shooting with the shutter remaining open such as occurs when shooting video or stills in <em>Live View</em>. And it should be quite obvious if you are shooting 60 fps you are limited to shutter speeds faster than 1/60 second. In effect, those cameras are doing nothing more than taking video and saving each frame as a separate file.</p>

"What is the function of the tint slider in Lightroom?","9807","","<p>In Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (c) there's a Temp slider <strong>which controls the color temperature of the photo</strong>. To the left it creates a blue, cold looking image. To the right, an orange, warm image. </p>

<p>This is easy to understand and easy to use.</p>

<p>But then is the ""Tint"" slider. To one side, it creates a purple image. To the other, a violet image. I really don't understand the purpose of this slider.</p>

<p>When I use it, I feel like I'm using the tint slider on an old NTSC television. What's the point of having a violet/purple image? How can I use it to improve my images? When I can't get the color right in my photos, I set the program to AWB and then tweak the temp slider, but I never touch the Tint one.</p>

<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong> </p>
","<p>The tint slider takes care of a couple things. First off, from a color perception standpoint, there are two major axes that the cones of our eyes base color perception on: blue/yellow and magenta/green. There are some specific nuances related to these axes, however the most important is that they represent opposite colors that the human eye can not see simultaneously at any given single point (i.e. you can't see blue and yellow at the same location point...<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color"" rel=""noreferrer"">the eye oscillates between the two</a>....however you could see blue and or green.) Most color calculations that involve human perception are done in L<em>a</em>b* space, which is fundamentally based on those two axes of color. </p>

<p>When it comes to the blue/yellow axis, this happens to be the primary axis along with white point falls. White point is a critical component of color balance, and is generally why we make color temperature adjustments far more frequently than we do tint adjustments. This is partly due to the kinds of illumination we normally use to light photographic scenes as well. Sunlight, incandescent lighting, and a considerable amount of photographic artificial lighting is achieved via black-body emission lighting...matter heated to the point of emitting light. Such lighting usually emits light along the blue/yellow axis, rather than the green/magenta axis. </p>

<p>Another form of lighting, gas-emission lighting, usually emits light more in line with the green/magenta axis. Gas-emission lighting is usually found in fluorescent lights, neon lighting, etc. Scenes photographed under gas-emission lighting will usually take on a greenish or slightly magenta-tinged appearance (at the best of times), or may end up with a more aberrant appearance. The <strong>Tint</strong> slider in Lightroom is a way to correct for ""off-axis"" color balance issues often caused by gas-emission lighting or any form of non-standard (blackbody) lighting. </p>

<p>Generally speaking, color balance corrections will be done primarily with the <strong>Color Temperature</strong> slider, with minor adjustments to the <strong>Tint</strong> slider. Alternatively, the color temperature and tint sliders can be used to accomplish artistic effect, <em>adding</em> a strong color cast to your photos when one is absent. You may have a scene that is slightly purple-tinged, and one can enhance the artistic appearance of that purple tinge by making a larger-than-normal tint adjustment towards magenta.</p>

"How can I tell if my film is over/underdeveloped?","9799","","<p>The question is pretty basic (and should be asked for reference's sake): how can I tell if I have over- or underdeveloped my film? What are the signs?</p>
","<p>First, some background:  Developer works by turning silver halide crystals on the film base which have been exposed to light into metallic silver.  When the film is put into fixer, silver halide (unexposed) is dissolved and any metallic silver (exposed) is left alone.  Being an analog process, crystals which have been exposed to more light will react with the developer more rapidly than those exposed to less.  There are other factors that have an impact on the reaction rate, notably the temperature and how much the solution is agitated, but let's assume they remain constant.</p>

<p>If you don't leave your film in the developer long enough, less of the halide crystals will turn to silver, and more of them will be dissolved during fixing.  The result will be a ""thin"" negative that's mostly see-through.  An extreme version of this would be to process a piece of scrap film in fixer without developing it first.  Since none of the silver halides have become metallic, all of them will be removed and you'll be left with just the film base.</p>

<p>Leaving the film in the developer longer gives the less-exposed crystals more opportunity to react, resulting in more metallic silver being left on the base that won't dissolve during fixing.  The resulting negative will be ""thick"" and harder to see through.  Leave the film in the developer long enough and you'll get black negatives when you pull them from the fixer.</p>

<p>In both cases, one clear sign of over- or under-development is a lack of detail in the negative, because the details tend not to be solidly exposed or not exposed.  Being on the wrong side of ""correct"" development will mean those parts react and swept away in the fix or don't and remain on the base.</p>

<p>If you've heard the terms ""push"" or ""pull"" processing, they mean the deliberate use of overdevelopment to bring an image out of underexposed film and deliberate underdevelopment to prevent overexposed film from going black.  Most of us do this to some degree with paper prints under safelight by watching for a satisfactory level of development and putting it into stop bath to halt the process.</p>

<p>I was wondering whether this is true, or better yet, how radical the quality decrease really is?</p>

<p>What would be the best option for this situation?</p>
","<p><strong>Anytime you add something in the optical path you will lose quality.</strong> The quality you will lose depends on the filter quality, filter type and lighting conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Most filters are extremely susceptible to flare</strong> because they add a flat reflective surface and can take a great image and <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/11518/where-does-this-reflection-come-from-in-a-long-exposure-shot"">make it completely unusable</a>. That does not mean you should never use a filter or even more than one, but you should do so for a valid reason knowing the sacrifice you are making at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Polarizers have specific usage and an effect which cannot be simulated by software</strong>, so use them to cut-down reflection, increase saturation in the sky, etc. No need to add it over another filter that essentially does nothing.</p>

<p><strong>UV filters have a use too but are rarely actually needed.</strong> They are usually recommended at high-altitude but AWB or custom white-balance takes care of that. Since they are cheap and do not cut-down light by much you can use them to <strong>protect your lens when it is in eminent danger such as near salt-water and flying sand</strong>.</p>

<p>Against knocks, <strong>a lens hood is much more effective protection</strong> and may even increase image quality by reducing flare from stray light.</p>
","12662"
"Should I put UV filter to protect the lens even if I put a lens hood?","9767","","<p>That's pretty it, usually you buy a UV filter to protect the lens. My question is do I need the UV filter even if I'm using a lens hood?</p>
","<p>The hood protects the lens of physical impact from knock and obstacles. It also reduces flare and keeps image quality to what the lens is capable of.</p>

<p>A UV filter protects against flying dangers such as sand, salt and other elements. While doing so a UV filter is detrimental to image quality as it adds additional reflections from another glass element in the optical path.</p>

<p>Therefore in most cases you should ONLY use the hood. If you are in proximity of sea-water splashing or flying sand, then you should but a UV filter too. Since flare can still be a problem, it is best to do both if you can.</p>

","<p>I think the other answers may have missed the issue here.</p>

<p>Seeing compression artefacts on a RAW file in Lightroom is quite a common issue and it drove me nuts when I first encountered it. It turns out what you're seeing is just regular JPEG compression in the <strong>preview image</strong> that Lightroom generates. For performance reasons, in the Library module Lightroom only loads the preview and not the original RAW. The banding should disappear when you switch to the Develop module and the RAW is loaded. (Sometimes you'll find you need to zoom in to 100% and back out to force load the RAW - that seems to be an intermittent bug.) You're absolutely right that you shouldn't be seeing those blocky artefacts in a RAW file.</p>

<p>Someone knows?<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n3zap.png"" alt=""alt text""> </p>
","<p>The glare effect on the monitor itself is a digitized effect, it is not real. Technically speaking, it is near impossible to get a clear <em>photograph</em> of a computer screen with the image it is displaying like you can see in that Apple example. What is generally done is a photograph of the screen(s) are taken while they are off, and the images that are supposedly being displayed on the screens, as well as the highlights, are added using Photoshop.</p>

<p>It may be possible to get something similar to that using a very carefully crafted lighting setup, however it is highly doubtful that you would ever get such a clean highlight with such a crisp edge. Highlights in reality are reflections (usually specular) of light sources, so a rectangular light source with just the right shape and brightness would be necessary to generate a highlight like that. </p>

<p>I don't do much in the way of still object photography myself, I've only observed it being done. I have, however, done quite a bit of graphic design work, and the effect is a breeze to do using photoshop and a stock photo of a monitor (or monitors) All it really takes is a screen shot of the image you want the monitor to be displaying scaled, skewed, and rotated to fit the screen, and a translucent white gradient drawn at the appropriate angle.</p>

<p>As I understand it, while 35mm still counts a ""normal"" lens for the Nikon D90, for my Canon 40D, it would be a tad too long. Something around 30mm would probably be more appropriate, right? </p>

<li>CANON EF 35mm F/2.0: too long? Slightly more expensive as Nikon but only F/2.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that an equivalent Canon lens will be around twice as expensive as the above Nikon. Is this correct? Or did I overlook something?</p>
","<p>I'd worry less about ""what's comparable"" and worry more about ""what's right for you.""</p>

<p>The difference in the crop factor between the Canon 40D (1.6x) and the Nikon D90 (1.5x) is fairly small: 56mm EFL vs 52.5mm EFL. That's only a 6.25% difference.

Have a look <a href=""http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/calc.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at the angle of view calculators here</a> to get an idea. </p>

<p>Similarly: the difference between f/2.0 and f/1.8 isn't huge: only 1/3 of a stop. It's some additional control over depth of field and low-light performance, but probably not enough to make a big deal over in practice. See <a href=""http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DOFMaster</a> for more calculations.</p>

<p>Depending on what type of photography you're doing, you could easily lean towards the 28mm f/2.8 over the 35mm f/2. For example, the former would be better for landscapes, because it's wider and the smaller minimum aperture doesn't matter as much. For indoor shots of people, the reverse would be true.</p>

<p>There's going to be differences between the lenses themselves too. Any of the lenses you mentioned might be (less) sharper than the others, or than the equivalent Nikon lenses.</p>

<p>And, of course, it all has to fit into your budget.</p>

<p>So: take a look at how much you want to spend and what you want to photograph, and then pick the most appropriate lens out of your options. Don't worry about what Nikon has; it doesn't really affect you.</p>

"How do Cokin and Lee filter systems compare to each other?","9694","","<p>Is there any material difference between Cokin and Lee filter systems?</p>

<p>I'm looking for a limited range of filters - ND, Grad ND and Polariser - for use with a Sigma 10-20 Wide angle lens on a Nikon D200, predominantly for landscapes. Which way should I jump and will my choosing (say) a Cokin filter holder rather than a Lee one limit me to using Cokin filters?</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Danny</p>
","<p>I had some Cokin filters earlier, and was thinking of getting some again, mostly ND and effect filters.</p>

<p>The difference between the systems is first of all in the size of the filters. The Lee standard system uses 100 mm filters, while the Cokin P system uses 84 mm filters. The less common Cokin Z-PRO system uses 100 mm filters, so they should be compatible with the Lee system. I have also seen mentioned Lee filters made compatible for the Cokin P system.</p>

<p>From what I have read, Lee filters are higher quality (durable and even in color), but also a lot more expensive. A cokin user had problems with the neutral density filters not being really neutral, however that shouldn't be a big problem if you are using a digital camera, as you can adjust the white balance to compensate for any differences.</p>

<p>For a 10-20 lens you should be careful what holder you get. There are special low-profile holders for wide angle lenses that you might need so that it's not visible in the image.</p>

"My grandfather gave me a box full of negatives. Does it implicitly give the copyright to the pictures?","9665","","<p>My grandfather, who lives in Cuba, gave me a box full of family picture negatives that he shot in Cuba from around 1940's to 1970's. Some of these pictures are very interesting and I think could sell them. I live in the United States.</p>

<p>He is fine with me doing anything I want with the pictures (that is why he gave them to me in the first place). I'm not very familiar with copyright law. I want to know if I'm now the legal copyright holder of these pictures. Or do I need some sort of signed statement from him?</p>

<p>Does the copyright get automatically transferred to me along with the original film?</p>

<p>In the US (and Canada I believe), unless otherwise transferred or granted by explicit license or contract, copyright belongs to the person who took the picture, regardless of ownership of the camera or the media on which the image was recorded.</p>

<p>This means that if you hand your camera over to a stranger to take a picture of you in front of a landmark, then <em>technically</em>, the stranger owns the copyright. Of course, this is almost impossible to enforce, and I can't imagine the copyright office bothering to get involved in a putative dispute such as that.</p>

<p>This also means that <a href=""https://www.dpreview.com/articles/3137756671/monkey-photo-copyright-in-question-as-wikipedia-denies-photographer-takedown-request"" rel=""noreferrer"">if you let a monkey hold your camera and it accidentally manages to take its own selfie, you do not own the copyright of that image</a>. (It can't have any copyright assigned, because the copyright office won't register rights to non-humans).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>Under the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention"" rel=""noreferrer"">Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</a>, signatory countries agree that copyright is established the moment a work is ""fixed"" (i.e., you possess copyright to a photo the moment you take the image), and that countries agree to honor the copyright laws of other signing countries where international issues may arise.</p>

<p>In this specific case in question, where the works were created by a Cuban national in Cuba and the rights are being sought to transfer a license or ownership to the U.S., this situation certainly falls under Berne Convention issues.</p>

<p>The following two-part article series by Nicole Martinez writing for Art Law Journal covers transference of derivative rights from a Cuba artist to an artist in the U.S.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://artlawjournal.com/relaxing-cuba-trade-embargo-affect-artists/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>How does Relaxing the Cuba Trade Embargo Affect Artists?</em></a> (part I)</li>
<li><a href=""https://artlawjournal.com/cuban-copyright-abroad/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Can a Cuban National License a Copyright to a U.S. Citizen?</em></a> (part II)</li>
</ul>

<p>Briefly, in the articles, a Cuban author wrote very popular children's books. The author's friend Miguel, while living in the United States, adapted the books into a screenplay, and sought to have the screenplay produced into a film. As the screenplay is a <em>derivative work</em>, before such a film could be made, studios needed to secure rights to the adaptation. Whether, and how, the rights could be granted or transferred is the subject of Martinez's two-part articles.</p>

<p>Quoting from part II, Martinez writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does a Cuban national have unilateral authority to grant a license for copyright, when the licensee is a foreign citizen?</p>
  
  <p>As we discussed in Part I of our series, Miguel and his friend would not be able to enter into a contract for the use of the copyright under the existing trade embargo between the U.S. and Cuba. But they may be able to contract under Obama’s new regulations, if Miguel and his friend are able to prove that importing the copyrighted work into the U.S. “greatly enhance the free flow of ideas between Cuba and the United States.”</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, Cuba has laws in place that restrict the free usage of copyrights in other states. <strong>Under Article 42 of the Cuban copyright law, a Cuban author may only grant the transfer or use of his work abroad through special permission by the Cuban government.</strong> Once again, Miguel and his friend would need to have their contract for the use of the copyright approved before they can move forward, and <strong>the Cuban government would have the unilateral right to refuse that the work be used within the United States.</strong></p>
  
  <p>And since Cuba is a subscribing nation to the Berne Convention, that means that the U.S. will need to apply Cuba’s copyright laws to the contract between Miguel and his friend. This effectively means that <strong>unless the Cuban government approves the use of the copyright abroad, Miguel will not be able to adapt the work for U.S. cinema.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly recommend reading both articles to get a better understanding of the issues in play: the Berne Convention; Cuban copyright law; longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba; lifting of certain embargo restrictions under the Obama administration. And of course, since the articles were written, there are new developments in the U.S.–Cuba relations since Obama's administration.</p>

<p>These articles are of course not definitive on the subject, and certainly might not encapsulate the situation regarding the current question (mainly, transferring of photo copyrights amongst family members across international borders). But they provide an interesting basis to begin understanding some of the issues involved.</p>

"What post-processing tricks can be used to improve the quality of photos taken with the on-camera flash?","9664","","<p>I know that the on-camera flash tends to produce poor images in general (the subjects are washed out, and the light from the flash isn't very powerful).  But... sometimes there's no other choice but to use the on-camera flash and hope for the best.  So I'm wondering, what is the best way to recover these images are in post-processing?</p>

<p>My question is similar to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/11194/what-post-processing-methods-work-best-to-fix-photos-that-are-blown-out-from-f"">this question about fixing blown-out highlights</a>; however, I'm interested more in things I can do to improve the entire image quality -- so this might include things like better color balance, ways to make the subject look less flat, etc.</p>

<p>I'm interested particularly in answers that use tricks or techniques that aren't necessarily ""obvious"", but might be considered ""tricks of the trade"" by professional photographers (I assume they have to deal with this problem sometimes, too?) -- I have both Lightroom and CS5, and am reasonably proficient with their basic use, but I know I'm probably just scratching the surface of their power.  So nothing's off-limits for this answer -- if you have a solution, but it requires 20 layers and 15 different brushes, I'm all ears!  </p>

<p><strong>Edited to add</strong>: Note that I'm asking about photos that I've already taken, so any preprocessing tips are not helpful to me.  Additionally, I <em>do</em> have a bounce flash, but there are certain settings in which it's not useful (if, say, there's nothing to bounce off of!), and the only way to get any light into the frame is direct hard light.  My question is about how to make the best of these less-than-ideal shooting conditions in post-processing.</p>
","<p>Here are a few ways I have fixed washed-out photos be it from the flash or just in general. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Adjust levels - I will slide the black slider to the right to darken the photo. Sometimes if only part of the photo is washed out I will use a mask on the levels to darken only what I want to. This masking can get complicated and I recommend looking up some <a href=""http://tv.adobe.com/watch/the-russell-brown-show/advanced-masking-with-photoshop-cs5/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorials</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Curves is another tool I have used but can be a bit tricky. </p></li>
<li><p>High Pass Filter to bring details into the image and sometimes helps the washed out look. For a tutorial on the high pass filter <a href=""http://abduzeedo.com/photoshop-quick-tips-3-enhancing-photos-high-pass-filter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Shooting in RAW and adjusting the sliders sometimes is all that is needed</p></li>
<li><p>Burn to image to darken where needed. You can do this in Photoshop non-destructively by creating a new layer, filling the layer with 50% Gray (Hex is #808080) then change that layers <code>Blend Mode</code> to <code>Overlay</code>, Then Burn on that layer (Dodge will also work on the same layer)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a black layer and change the blend modes to soft light. </p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate photo and change blend modes to see what helps darken the photo. Again advanced masking is sometimes involved and experimentation is required to see if this will work for your photo and what blend mode will work. </p></li>
<li><p>Use a plugin like <a href=""http://www.topazlabs.com/adjust/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Topaz Adjust</a> to change the photo. </p></li>
<li><p>PS Photo Filters can help.</p></li>
<li><p>I will sometimes use a combo of the above. </p></li>
<li><p>The biggest trick is experimentation with filters, settings, etc in PS to see what happens. But always remember...HAVE FUN! =></p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are all done in Photoshop CS5/CS6. I do not have any examples I can currently post or I would. </p>

"What can tall photographers do about tripod height?","9648","","<p>I'm in the market for my first tripod, and have noticed that they generally top out around 175cm(5'8"") tall. I'm 200cm(6'6"") tall, and while there aren't many people taller than me, there <em>are</em> some. </p>

<p>What do other tall photographers do?</p>

<ul>
<li>Suck it up and hunch over, as we must for most things in life? (cars, doorways, kitchen counters, etc.)</li>
<li>Customize your own tripod?</li>
<li>Find a boutique ""big &amp; tall tripod"" retailer?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There are quite a few tripods that are taller than you (without a head), and many more that would come to eye level comfortably with a head. Brands include Benbo, Benro, Berlebach (wooden), Cullman, Davis &amp; Sanford, Giottos, Gitzo, Induro, Kowa, Linhof, Majestic, Manfrotto, Slik and the 3-Legged Thing. Some of those you would need a stepladder to use at their full extended height. If you're a studio shooter, most camera stands go to eight feet (240cm) or higher. To go shopping, I'd suggest using the <a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/Tripod-Legs/ci/2636/N/4291756643"" rel=""noreferrer"">B&amp;H Photo and Video site</a> and it's excellent search filters. (You don't need to buy from them, but their site is probably the best way to find out what you want to buy.)</p>

<p>But that's not the whole story in any case. I'm not particularly tall (5'9""/173cm), and while I have used the Benbo 2's full reach (253 cm without a head) out in the field and spent some time on a ladder with studio camera stands, that's not the normal state of affairs. Hunching, crouching, kneeling and lying down are. That's not because of the height of the camera support, but because the subject demands it. One of the pleasures of working with real fashion models was that they were some of the few people I could shoot even part of the time from anything like a standing height (take somebody who stands a little taller than me, then add heels, and I'd barely have to bend to get down to a good level for a 1/2- or 3/4-length shot -- but I'd still have to bend). You can always put people on risers, of course, but landscapes are rarely cooperative in that way (and there are Laws of the Universe stating that the best angle for a landscape will always be something other than your normal standing point of view; like the time of arrival at a restaurant, it is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_in_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Bistromathic_drive"" rel=""noreferrer"">recipriversexcluson</a>).</p>

<p>So yes, you can find a tripod that will let you work comfortably, but you'll find that comfort and photography are almost mutually exclusive.</p>

"Is there a way to adjust the aperture of a Nikon lens without a camera or physical aperture ring?","9619","","<p>If I have a camera that does not have any electronic connection to the lens, is there <em>any</em> way to adjust the aperture on the lens if it does not have a physical aperture ring?</p>

<p>We're using a scientific camera (Imperx Bobcat) which does not have any electronic connections in the mount for the lens. It mounts Nikon lenses, but the mount doesn't have the necessary electronic connections. This has been fine for us in the past, as we have always used lenses with a physical aperture ring. (We manually focus the lens for our experiments, so autofocus isn't a concern.) We recently gained access to a AF-S NIKKOR 200mm f/2G ED VR II lens, but it lacks a physical aperture ring.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of adapter or 'smart' extension tube that would let us adjust the aperture manually on a lens without an aperture ring? (We typically use extension tubes, so the extra distance is not a concern.) The easy answer is likely to just use a lens with an aperture ring, but we wanted to see if there were any possible options for the above scenario.</p>
","<p>Ultimately, we decided to use a <a href=""https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/37175-REG/Nikon_2658.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikon BR-6 Auto Diaphragm Ring</a> combined with a <a href=""https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/lens-adapters/br-2a-lens-reversing-ring-for-52mm-thread.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BR-2A Lens Reversing Ring</a>, plus a <a href=""https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/remote-cords/ar-10-double-cable-release-to-mf-24-for-md-terminal.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nikon AR-10 cable release</a> for setting the aperture. </p>

<p>This was the setup: A Nikon lens (lacking an aperture ring) connected directly to the BR-6 F-mount socket. The 52mm threaded rear of the BR-6 connected to the BR-2A 52mm threads. The other side of the BR-2A attached to the F-mount of the camera body. The Nikon AR-10 cable release connected to the BR-6 for manually setting the aperture.</p>

<p>This was admittedly an <strong>ugly</strong> solution. The BR-6 and BR-2A act like extension tubes (hurting far focus), and you cannot readily set the aperture accurately to a known value (other than wide open or closed). However, for our specific application, these tradeoffs were acceptable. Be advised that in a more conventional photographic setting, these compromises may be far more unpalatable / problematic.</p>

"What is a rolling shutter? When do I have to be aware of it?","9595","","<p>In answer to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/4115/problem-with-fluorescent-lighting-and-shutter-speed/4141#4141"">another question</a>, Adam Davis writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your camera complicates this by using
  a rolling shutter above a given speed
  (usually around 1/200. This means that
  only a portion of the image sensor is
  exposed to the scene at any given
  time, so if the light changes during
  the exposure, the color change will
  only affect a portion of the image

<p>Rolling shutters often are also mentioned in the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/9223/why-do-dslrs-in-movie-mode-have-a-rolling-shutter-instead-of-a-global-shutter"">context of DSLR videography</a>.  However, I am yet to see a discussion of what a rolling shutter is, how it works and when it is important.</p>

<p>What is a rolling shutter?</p>

<p>What are the implications of using one for my photos?</p>
","<p><strong>What Adam is referring to</strong></p>

<p>What Adam is talking about is not actually a rolling shutter, it's just a focal plane shutter. It also does nothing special above 1/200, except that the effect of the shutter curtain has some interesting properties which can become more pronounced at higher speed.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal-plane_shutter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagrams on the wikipedia page</a> (reproduced below) illustrate it best.  Essentially the shutter consists of two curtains which move from top to bottom (or in some film cameras, left to right) in quick succession.  The gap between them is what exposes the image.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kUIG7.gif"" alt=""Focal plane shutter, low speed""> </p>

<p><em>Focal-plane shutter, low speed.  Black square is the sensor, red and green squares are the first and second curtains</em>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPaHw.gif"" alt=""Focal plane shutter, high speed""></p>

<p><em>Focal-plane shutter, high speed.  Black square is the sensor, red and green squares are the first and second curtains</em>.</p>

<p>If the shutter speed is fast enough, the second one will start closing before the first one has fully finished opening, so the entire frame won't all be exposed at once.  Therefore, you get a situation where anything that happens really fast, like the flash of a camera or the oscillation of a fluorescent light, may cause light not to cover the entire frame but instead create bands or gradients from top to bottom where the light is different.</p>

<p><strong>What a rolling shutter effect is</strong></p>

<p>The <em>rolling shutter effect</em> as it applies to digital video is quite a different and quite unrelated effect to the one described above.  Actually, a rolling shutter effect does not actually involve a physical shutter, but it's called that as a convention because it is analogous to the way a film cinema camera has a shutter that moves across the frame.  In digital video, the rolling shutter effect is the result of the way a CMOS sensor is read.</p>

<p>CMOS sensors exhibit a rolling shutter effect when they are in live view or video mode, in which they are being read for every video frame. Instead of capturing the entire frame at once, information is read from each row of the frame one after the other, top to bottom. The whole process takes up to 1/30 of a second on most cameras. This creates a jelly-like wobbling effect in recorded video when the camera is handheld or moves a lot.</p>

<p>In a given sensor, this rolling shutter happens equally regardless of the shutter speed, though with slower shutter speeds it may be less noticeable in subject movement because of the extra motion blur.  The effect is not usually noticeable when the camera is fixed on a tripod or panned steadily, but is more obvious when the camera is hand-held or during fast camera movements.</p>

<p>CMOS sensors capable of higher frame rates than 30 frames per second (and not just through repeating frames) will exhibit less rolling shutter effect because their sensors will have been designed to be read faster.</p>

<p>CCD does not suffer from the rolling shutter effect.</p>

"Is it wise to use polarizing filters with wide-angle lenses?","9575","","<p>I've been looking into whether to use a regular UV or polarizing filter for a 16mm wide-angle lens and have found that a large number of people believe that you should never use a polarizer with a wide-angle lens. The reasoning seems to be that because of the sheer width of the image frame, the angle away from the sun can vary by such a large degree across the width of the frame that your picture will likely exhibit clear changes in saturation and brightness from one edge to the other. I can see why this might be the case and that for the most part that it might be undesirable, but is it really that much of a problem? Are there any examples of situations where this effect can be used to your advantage?</p>
","<p>It's something to be aware of, but as long as you're aware of it, you can often still use a polarizer.</p>

<p>I've a 10-22mm UWA and I'm quite happy that I spent the money to get a polarizer for it.
A couple of suggestions for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can often hide the variation across the image by e.g. including clouds in skies for example</li>
<li>When you've rotated your polarizer to get maximum effect, rotate it back slightly to back off the effect, and you can still get some of the benefit of a polarizer.</li>
<li>Shoot portrait instead of landscape.</li>

"When do you not want to use continuous autofocus (C-AF)?","9571","","<p>This Nikon promotion website sums up when to use single autofocus and when to use continuous autofocus. (<a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/history/basics/16/03.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://imaging.nikon.com/history/basics/16/03.htm</a>)</p>

<p>So, basically if you want to focus-and-recompose, continuous autofocus won't work for obvious reasons. But other than that, is there any other situation in which continuous autofocus also is less suitable than single autofocus? I really can't think of any. I do not use focus-and-recompose either, as I prefer to move the focus point around. That means I can always set the focus mode to continuous autofocus, and it left me wondering when I should use single autofocus.</p>
","<p>Reliability is the true reason. When a camera focuses continuously, it keeps measuring focus and readjusting. In a perfect implementation it would lock focus and follow your subject perfectly but that does not happen. In practice, cameras spend a good percentage of the time catching up to a subject's motion, so your subject may not be exactly in focus at the precise moment you want to take the shot. Higher-end cameras do better but still, none is perfect 100% of the time.</p>

<p>Another reason is battery-life. Continuously focusing drains the battery quicker than not. There are some cameras equipped with an AF-A which is designed to do AF-S first and then switch to AF-C at the point subject motion is detected. That is there more to save battery life and make things more predictable but is not perfect either. Particularly if you use automatic focus-point selection which means that some active AF-points will be outside of your intended subject and the camera can see movement on one such point and shift focus to another subject, potentially causing you to miss a shot.</p>

"Why is Photoshop not merging my panorama?","9561","","<p>It's not something i am planning on doing often but I wanted to try to do a panorama and use Photoshop's ""Merge to Panorama"" feature to stitch the images. Previously I have only done this manually. 
I think I have a decent overlap in my images but Photoshop is unable to stitch my images. I have 2 sets of images and it stitches the middle group fine but not the first and the last image. This is similar with my other group of images where it stitches 2 middle groups and not the first and the last image.  Below is a screen capture of what i usually get:</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GPVHA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The framing of the first and last images seems to be significantly different from the others (it took a while for me to see that the top pic was the last and the bottom the first, assuming left-to-right sequence). There may simply be too much ambiguity for Photoshop to deal with in this particular sequence, since the main differentiator is colour (something PS autocorrects to a degree in stitching), with the darkness of the islands and clouds being the ""anchor"", and both of the pics left out have the horizon in a significantly different place than their next-door neighbors.</p>

<p>I don't know how the panoramic merge works in PS these days (I'm still running CS3), but this looks to me like one of those instances where manual tiling would be necessary, and I'd expect to lose (or have to synthesize) a significant part of the vertical after the stitching because of the framing issue.</p>

"Is a VR lens worth getting?","9559","","<p>I'm thinking of getting a new lens for my Nikon D200. The question is whether or not to get one with VR (Vibration Reduction). </p>

<p>I'm looking for something for taking motor sport and wild life pictures. </p>

<p>Are there any situations where the VR features cause problems? I've heard that if you want to take action photos that involve panning, then VR can be a problem.</p>
","<p>There are a variety of types of lenses with VR/IS capabilities. Many of the older, first generation versions have limited stabilization capabilities, and no way to restrict stabilization to a single plane of motion.</p>

<p>Modern lenses with VR/IS capabilities tend to be much more advanced. They usually offer anywhere from <em>two</em> to a whopping <strong>four</strong> stops of hand-holdability in average circumstances. Newer lenses also tend to include a mode switch that allows you to disable stabilization in the horizontal plane, allowing you to pan the camera to capture sports or wildlife motion without stabilization interfering, while still stabilizing in the vertical plane.</p>

<p>Vibration reduction can be a considerable bonus with telephoto lenses when you can't afford a wide aperture. A 300mm or longer f/2.8 lens can cost a considerable amount of money, anywhere from $2000 up to several thousand for something in the range of 500mm or greater. For contrast, a Canon EF 300mm f/4 lens with Image Stabilization costs about $1200, while the Canon EF 300mm f/2.8 lens (which also has IS) costs $4500. Similarly, the Nikon 300mm f/2.8 lens (with VR) costs about $5,900. Sadly, I don't believe Nikon has any non f/2.8 telephoto lenses with VR, all of their VR lenses seem to already be fast f/2.8 lenses (or f/4 once you pass 400mm, which is still a very wide aperture for 500-600mm lenses.)</p>

<p>Another interesting comparison can be made with telephoto zoom lenses. A comparable example would be Canon's 70-200mm lens line, of which there are four current models. Two f/4's and two f/2.8's. The prices break out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>       | No IS |  IS
=======================
 f/4.0 | $626  | $1200
 f/2.8 | $1200 | $2300
</code></pre>

<p>The 70-200/4 IS costs about the same as the 70-200/2.8 w/o IS. The f/4 IS version brings to the table a whopping <strong>3-4 stops</strong> of additional hand-holdability, which technically makes it a better low-light lens than the f/2.8 w/o IS...by nearly two stops. With good technique, you should be able to get shots with the f/4 IS lens that you could get with an f/1.4-f/1.8 Non-IS lens, which is pretty amazing. (A good hand-held technique would be required to get the full 4-stop benefit of this particular lenses IS, but with practice, I've heard many people state that they can easily get 4 stops lower shutter speed.) I believe Nikon has very similar offerings in the 70-200mm range with VR.</p>

<p>Vibration Reduction/Image Stabilization can be problematic in some cases. Again, modern stabilization systems are a lot more advanced, and these problems are either non-existent, or very minor. Older lenses may have some issues when making large movements, or when mounted on a tripod. A common problem with stabilization is when it is used with a tripod-mounted lens and a cable release. It generally does not kick in until the shutter is at least partially depressed. When shooting hand-held, you should press the shutter button part way to enable stabilization, frame your shot, and fully depress the shutter button when you are ready to capture the shot. In this case, since VR/IS is already active, it doesn't change your framing when you fully depress the shutter button. With a tripod and cable release, you tend to fully depress the shutter button once everything is framed and ready to go. Stabilization will kick in at the last moment, and will usually change your framing or <strong>introduce</strong> vibration or funky blurring due to its untimely activation. In these cases, it is best to disable stabilization. Modern lenses often have tripod-sensing stabilization, which will automatically disable it when it senses that it is mounted on a tripod (which is done by matching the patterns of vibration, which differ significantly when hand-held.) Even with tripod-sensing stabilization, some circumstances, such as wind, can hamper any automatic features. Generally speaking, it is best to disable stabilization when you use a tripod.</p>

"How can I get a black background in daylight using flash sync speed with no extra gear?","9538","","<p>I have seen sports photography where the background is completely wiped out (black) during daylight. I'm trying to achieve a similar (pure black background) effect with no extra gear, just a DSLR camera (Canon 20D). </p>

<p>I think this is doable using sync speed (where the sensor is fully exposed to the flash burst), closer flash burst to the subject, and some suitable shutter setting. How can I minimize light to the sensor before 120th of a second at ISO 100?      </p>
","<p>To overpower the sun during the day you need either very high speed sync (i.e. with a leaf or electronic shutter), or tons of light and an ND filter.</p>

<p>The theory is that the exposure from a flash is practically unaffected by the shutter speed, so by using a high shutter speed you let in the <strong>same amount</strong> of flash but <strong>much less</strong> ambient light, allowing your flash to overpower the ambient.</p>

<p>The problem is, with most cameras, including your 20D you can't shoot past 1/250s when using the flash, as beyond that the second curtain starts closing before the first has fully opened and your flash is only visible in part of the image. </p>

<p>Some new flashes offer high speed sync, which pulses the flash to act like a continuous source. The problem with this approach is that <strong>when you up the shutter speed you let in less flash as well as less ambient</strong> so you don't gain anything. Some people combine several flashes to compensate for the loss of light, but in mist cases there's no difference between multiple flash HSS, and using tons of flashes with normal sync plus an ND filter. Here's a good post about using HSS to get the effect you want with multiple flash units:
<a href=""http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/05/joe-mcnally-desert-shoot.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/05/joe-mcnally-desert-shoot.html</a></p>

<p><em>Hit the comments for a lengthy debate on the merits of HSS vs. regular sync and ND filters (the short answer, you don't gain any extra power with pulsed HSS).</em></p>

<p>Older digital cameras used electronic shutters which don't suffer from the second curtain problem and so can sync up to 1/4000s without pulsing the flash, letting you overpower the sun with a single flash unit. See
<a href=""http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/01/control-your-world-with-ultra-high-sync.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/01/control-your-world-with-ultra-high-sync.html</a></p>

<h2>edit:</h2>

<p>With no extra gear, assuming you have a flash capable of HSS your only option is to get as close as possible with the strobe, light power squares with distance, meaning getting twice as close gives you 4 x the power, getting four times as close gives you 16 times the power! I would start at your base ISO, f/5.6 and walk the shutter speed up until you lose the ambient.</p>

I've taken photos in Auto mode and emulated the aperture and shutter speed settings in manual. ISO is chosen by auto mode and doesn't tell me what is used, so I've used all the ISO settings in manual — to no avail. Auto mode captures more realistic colours of sunrise and sunset (with some grain). My manual photos of sunset and sunrise are too blue. I can't work out what's wrong, especially as I've tried many combinations of Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO. My camera is well travelled. By that I mean aeroplanes, motorbikes and bicycles. It is used at the beach quite a lot. It is kept in its case. It is 18 months old and is taken with me nearly everywhere - it's had a life! Is this problem I'm having just the way D3200s shoot? Or is there a problem with the camera or the operator?!!! </p>
","<p>Auto mode is auto exposure, and it also always uses auto White Balance and auto ISO, which cannot be turned off in Auto mode. Auto mode is ""auto everything"".</p>

<p>The A,S,P,M modes only set exposure, but can also use these Auto WB and Auto ISO if you enable them, however they can also be turned off.  Probably are not on by default. This can make a big difference, but you can set them as you wish.</p>

<p>A blue picture suggests your white balance is Incandescent (for indoor lights), when maybe it should be Daylight outside.  Or Auto white balance can make a fairly decent try at it too, not always right, but halfway close anyway (except Auto WB correction is a bad choice for sunsets). Auto mode will always use Auto White Balance.</p>

<p>See your camera manual index for white balance.  It is a basic of photography.
Experiment a bit setting it wrong once, Daylight indoors under incandescent light, and Incandescent outdoors in sunlight, and you will get the idea.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Is there a setting I should check to change this?</p>
","<p>This is to be expected.

If you use manual focus or prefocus, the lag should be somewhat reduced. </p>

<p>In ""normal"" SLR mode, the mirror directs part of the light to your viewfinder, and some of it to autofocus sensors located at the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/35531/where-is-the-af-sensor-located-in-a-dslr"">bottom of the camera body</a>. The sensor is totally obscured. With live view, the mirror is lifted out of the way and the main sensor used.</p>

I haven't used the D5300, but I found <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/55292773"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">others complaining about it</a>. A post there explains that in Nikon's consumer-level cameras, the mirror flip is inherently linked to the mechanism which closes down the aperture — in both modes, the focusing is done with the lens at its widest aperture setting to let in more light.</p>

<p>So, you can't manually focus to avoid this, and metering isn't the problem either. (This same complaint occurs in many cameras in burst mode with manual focus and manual exposure — there seems to be no reason to cycle the mirror, but it's common to do so anyway.)</p>

<p>Some cameras <em>are</em> much faster in live view. Sony's ""SLT"" design leaves the mirror in place <em>all the time</em>, using the partial split to feed the autofocus sensors and the <em>main sensor</em>, not a viewfinder. Other cameras have tiny phase-detect sensors mixed in with the pixels on the main sensor. And maybe some avoid the mirror-flip — although at this point in time, it's very common for it to happen anyway.</p>

<p>The best advice, I think, in your situation is to use the viewfinder. You'll still get the mirror flip, but just the once — and that's the <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/20744/how-can-i-turn-off-the-loud-sound-my-d3100-produces-when-i-take-a-photograph?rq=1"">sound</a> most people think of as the shutter.</p>

"Which impacts the speed of focusing more, the lens or the camera body?","9488","","<p>Speed is the larger concern, but a description of accuracy would be appreciated as well. </p>
","<p><strong>Autofocus Systems</strong></p>

<p>Autofocus is a system. There is no single part that is particularly responsible for making an AF system perform well or achieve high accuracy. In modern cameras, components and software that support AF are found in both the lens and the camera body. In some cameras that are still based on legacy AF systems, these components may be inferior, even significantly inferior, to modern fully electronic AF systems.</p>

<p>From a general standpoint, electronic autofocus systems where the motor is housed in the lens provide the greatest performance and highest accuracy. However an AF lens with a focus motor is only part of the picture...you still need a something to drive that motor and make it do its thing. There are also different kinds of motors, some are cheaper and less effective while others are more expensive and more effective. In addition to mechanical and electrical components, you also need appropriate software...firmware, to operate an AF system. In a modern electronic AF system, firmware usually exists in both the lens and the camera body. In older systems, firmware will likely only exist in the camera body (potentially along with the AF drive motor, as some older designs included the motor in the camera body rather than in the lens.)</p>

<p><strong>Autofocus Operation</strong></p>

<p>Autofocus in the past used to be achieved with partial open-loop feedback systems, where the camera would initiate an AF drive movement, the lens would adjust, and the system would stop until you told it to perform another AF adjustment. Depending on the exact implementations, more than one lens movement may have occurred in response to a single AF command. This may have been due to limited or no firmware in the lens, preventing a proper feedback loop. </p>

<p>In modern AF systems, AF drive is achieved with closed-loop feedback systems. With a closed loop, AF adjustments are continuously performed until focus is achieved...at least to within certain tolerances. This is possible due to much richer firmware housed in autofocus lenses, allowing more complete two-way communication between the lens and the camera. The camera instructs the lens to make a certain move, and the lens can provide information about whether it made the requested move, and whether the move was by the requested amount, or not. The camera and lens can continually make adjustments in response to a single AF command from the user to achieve a more accurate focus. </p>

<p>Such closed-loop feedback is a more recent advent in AF systems, supported by newer lens technology, more advanced AF drive software in camera bodies, and more accurate phase-shift detection sensors. AF speed and accuracy are increasingly dependent upon AF sensor capabilities, the number of AF sensor points, the capabilities of AF drive software, and the speed of in-camera processors.</p>

<p><strong>Autofocus Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to accuracy, there are several specific factors that play a role. The AF sensor is probably the most significant factor, however the firmware in the lens as well as the optical quality of the lens also count. Metering systems, particularly color metering systems, are also becoming tied into the AF system of modern cameras, offering increased capabilities not previously possible, or only possible on very high-end cameras. There are a wide variety of AF sensors on the market in current DSLR cameras, from basic 9-point sensors with a single high precision point to 61-point sensor with 41 high precision points, and a variety of options in between. The size of each AF point, their density, the orientation of phase-detect sensor lines, and even how sensor lines converge all affect the precision and accuracy of an AF system.</p>

<p>Naturally, the more complex the AF sensor is and the higher the number of AF points, the more complex the software that drives it must be. In modern ""reticular"" (net-like) AF systems, where there are a high number of points, as well as a high number of high precision points, the AF drive software is generally pretty advanced. A color metering sensor, either Olive/Teal (Red-Green and Blue-Green) or full RGB, may be involved in AF system decisions, allowing subject color, shape, and even identification based on libraries of known subjects can be used to assist in the selection of which AF points to use when determining focus.</p>

<p>The precision of an AF point depends on its structure. There are <em>single line points</em>, both horizontal and vertical sensors, <em>cross type points</em>, which involve both horizontal and vertical line sensors in a single AF point, and <em>diagonal cross type points</em> which involve two 45 degree line sensors in opposition to each other for a single AF point, and <em>double cross type points</em> that utilize both a standard and diagonal cross type set of sensors at a single AF point. The more line sensors, of any orientation, involved in the detection of phase-shift at a single AF point will increase the precision of focus detected by that point. </p>

<p>The design of each sensor also varies. Some line sensors are extremely high precision as they include more photodiodes per line, allowing phase shift to be detected in finer increments, yet requiring more light to do so. Others are lower precision as they use fewer photodiodes per line, sensing more light per sensor, therefor operating in lower overall light. Some AF points will only operate up to certain maximum apertures. The highest precision points tend to require f/2.8, and there are usually fewer points in an AF system that are this precise. Most AF points will require at least f/4 or f/5.6, operating in less light but also offering less precision. Some advanced AF systems support one or more AF points that will operate with lenses that have an f/8 maximum aperture (such as an f/5.6 lens with a 1.4x TC or an f/4 lens with a 2x TC). Most modern multipoint AF systems have f/2.8, f/4, and f/5.6 AF points, and a few include one or more f/8 AF points.</p>

<p><strong>Autofocus Performance</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to the speed of an AF system, this really boils down to two things: Light and processing performance. In almost all cases, the more light you get down the lens, the faster AF will be. This is due to the fact that an AF unit, a small package below the DSLR mirror that houses the AF sensor, utilizes only a fraction of the light that actually passes through the aperture. The mirror itself is half-silvered, and will allow about 50% of the light that reaches it through to a secondary mirror, which will reflect that 50% of light onto the AF unit. Further, only the area of the frame covered by AF points is actually half-silvered in the main mirror, so only a fraction of the total amount of light is involved in the first place...so were working with less than 50% of the total amount of light passing through the lens aperture. Furthermore, a special lens on top of the AF unit above the sensor is responsible for further dividing the light that reaches it. The light reaching the AF unit will be split by as many AF points, and for each AF point, light will be split again to reach the two, four, or even eight halves of each line sensor responsible for detecting phase shift for each AF point. An AF sensor has to work with less than 50% of the light passing through the lens, and each AF point works with a fraction of that light.</p>

<p>Assuming you have enough light to use the highest precision AF points, the key factor in performance is the efficiency of the AF drive software and the speed of the processor that executes it. An efficient algorithm operating on a fast processor, paired with a high quality lens that also includes a fast processor and efficient algorithms in its own firmware, will produce some of the best AF performance. In the case of the Canon 1D X, the AF and Metering system actually has a dedicated processor that is independent of the core image processors (a unique setup), providing continuous AF with uninterrupted processing power. High performance computing allows an AF system, both lens and camera, to perform closed-loop AF fine tuning several times in a fraction of a second, supporting extremely high precision, high accuracy continuous AF to be performed anywhere from 6 to 14 times per second.</p>

"What is the difference between point-and-shoot and SLR cameras?","9477","","<p>I have a very good (I assume) point and shoot high end camera with me. Model is Panasonic Fz35. I think it has very nice features and using the camera in manual mode is nice too. </p>

<p>However, with all the nice in-built features in my camera, can I say it's equivalent to any base SLR camera (ignoring additional lens for SLRs)? Can I use my camera as an SLR itself? If not, what basic things are missing from my camera to any basic SLR?</p>

<p>In short, what differentiates a high end point and shoot camera from an SLR?</p>
","<p>To be an SLR the camera has to have a mirror and optical viewfinder as cabbey states. The optical viewfinder has several advantages, namely a crisper image for easier manual focus (as you're getting the full resolving power of the lens, instead of a small LCD screen) and zero lag (as what you're seeing is happening in real time!) which can be useful for sports etc. There are a few disadvantages as well, you can't zoom an optical viewfinder, nor can you preview image settings (you can set an electronic viewfinder to show you the image in black and white for example).</p>

<p>Whilst the viewfinder is the only difference <em>by definition</em> there is another important distinction which impacts shooting, and that is that digital SLRs almost always have much larger sensors than compact bridge cameras like the FZ35. A larger sensor allows you to capture much more light giving the SLR much better performance in low light.</p>

<p>To visualise just how much bigger the sensor is in an SLR here's a visual comparison between the FZ35 (which is typical of bridge and compact cameras) and the Canon 1100D, a typical entry level digital SLR:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/sensor_sizes.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mattgrum.com/photo_se/sensor_sizes.png</a></p>

<p>Some compacts do have SLR sized sensors (eg. Sigma DP2, Fuji x100), but they tend to have a very limited zoom range. You certainly wouldn't be able to get a 18x zoom on anything but a small sensor! The ability to produce small light zoom lenses is the reason manufacturers have stuck to small sensors. </p>

<p>In addition to capturing more light, the larger sensor also gives you a shallower depth of field (when matching the field of view of a small sensor camera). This means the range of distances from the camera that are in focus is much smaller. This can be used to artistic effect allowing you to isolate the subject and blur out the background.</p>

<p>The only way to get blurred backgrounds with a small sensor compact is to use a long focal length (zoom in a lot), or get really close to a small subject (using the macro or close up function).</p>

<p>I would say shallow depth of field is the biggest difference in terms of the images, as nothing can be done to replicate the look of an SLR when producing images with shallow DoF in certain circumstances (except by faking it in Photoshop which is difficult and time consuming). When I see an image with shallow depth of field, especially if it's a moderately wide angle I can tell instantly it's from an SLR not a bridge camera.</p>

"Can I damage the focus system by turning the focus ring when the lens isn't mounted?","9469","","<p>I have a couple lenses that don't have an internal focusing system, and whenever I want to put them back in my bag, I turn the focus ring to make the lens shorter.</p>

<p>I noticed that when the lens is set to auto focus, the focus ring is harder to move than when it is on manual focus. Can I damage the focusing system by turning the focus ring when the lens is set to auto focus?</p>

<p>I would think that if the lens is off the camera it wouldn't cause any damage. Am I right?</p>
","<p>I think that depends a bit on the construction of the AF mechanism in the lens. If there is resistance when turning the focus ring, this also means that there is greater force applied to move the mechanics, and so there is greater stress in the material. I would personally switch over to manual focus for that procedure.</p>

","<p>Macro extension tubes. Get the Kenkos, they have no optical element so there's no sense in shelling out for the Canons. You can only get so close up with the 100 f/2.8 though, if you want to get even closer, you'll need to swap your lens in for a 180mm f/3.5L macro and, ultimately, an MP-E.</p>

","<p>If you upload a JPEG, Flickr does not modify the Original-size image in any way, apart from changing the filename.</p>

"How to learn to predict which lens to use between a 14-42mm and 40-150mm?","9405","","<p>I am a beginner who has bought Olympus EP-3 and it is my first camera with interchangeable lenses. My two lenses are: M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm 1:3.5-5.6 II R and M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 40-150mm 1:4.0-5.6 R. </p>

<p>So far I was mainly experimenting with the 14-42mm one and tried the 40-150mm one only once in the garden. I was zooming on individual plants and got nicely blurred background. I haven't tried the lens on the distance scenes or portraits though. The manufacturer description says that it is <em>a medium telephoto lens</em>  which is <em>perfect for close-up portraits or long distant scenes and it is flexible for indoor or outdoor use</em>. </p>

<p>I was wondering if I could use the telephoto one as my primary lens while sightseeing? Soon I'm going to Japan on my own. I will visit main cities and an island so I will be mainly taking pictures of architecture and landscapes without smiling people in front. I would like to minimise the need to change the lenses (especially outdoors) so I want to learn how to predict which lens will be more useful in various settings. Are there any general tips in that matter?</p>
","<p>Those lenses have very little overlap, so you will generally <em>known</em> which one you need. They are not interchangeable for any given subject. There are subjects you can take with both but the result will not be the same except between 40 and 42mm, so <strong>the one you use is the one that gives the results you are looking for</strong>.</p>

<p>The 14-42mm is a wide-angle to medium lens. It is good to shoot things that are relatively large such as buildings, interiors, etc. You can rarely use a longer lens for such subject because you would need to back away which is often not possible. Imagine take a shot of a large temple, unless is is in reserve or park, you can rarely move far enough to see it all with a long lens.</p>

<p>The 40-150mm is a telephoto lens and shows a smaller angle-of-view. It is used to pick out details, such as a person's face for a portrait, as opposed to a full-body image which is easier with the wider lens. Again, many times you cannot compensate by moving yourself closer to the subject. Doing so for a person also results in an unflattering perspective which is why  portraits are rarely shot with a wide-angle lens.</p>

<p><strong>The only thing to minimize lens changes is to buy a Zuiko 14-150mm</strong> which covers the whole range of both your lenses but you will lose some image quality by doing so.

<li>Next I sort through every frame I didn't put in the 'keepers' pile and look for anything that is bad enough to just trash immediately- usually there are a few out-of-focus or technically flawed photos that I didn't delete 'on-the-fly' which get taken out back behind the barn and put out of my misery.</li>
<li>I then look through the 'Keepers' and see if there are any 'holes' in the shoot that I will need to fill with the shots that weren't good enough to make my 'keepers' pile, but weren't bad enough to trash... Call it my 'marginal' pile if you will. If there are holes to be filled I then pick the 'best of the worst' to fill in those holes.</li>
<li>I post-process all the 'Keepers.' If it's a personal session I post 'em, if it's a professional session I work with the client further from there to close the contract.

"Should I buy a Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS or 70-200 f/4 L USM (without IS) for a wildlife safari?","9367","","<p>I'm a beginner to Photography with a Canon T3i, and love travelling and outdoors activities. Planning a trip to Africa to see wildlife this summer, and would love some help to chose between these two lenses.</p>

<p>Will the autofocus on either be a problem? Especially since we will be shooting at moving animals, birds - sometimes from a car, specially in Kenya.</p>

<p>Also when there is low light, will it be a problem with the 70-200 not having IS?  Keeping in mind I won't set my tripod up every shot I take, I mean I might be moving and want to shoot in the same time.</p>

<p>Also I need to use the lens I will buy in other outdoor activities afterwards, travelling, carnivals, night events as well. I really love taking photos during the night, like Whirling Dervishes, or sports such as sand boarding.</p>
","<p>(later edit of my answer: for a newer photographer, most of the suggestions made in this thread including mine are overkill. For a trip like this, something like a T5i (or choose a body. APS sensor is fine), the 24-105, and the Canon 100-400 would be a great setup and cover pretty much any need you could have that wouldn't require $10,000 lenses to shoot. And that set would cost about the same as just a 70-200 F2.8L IS II, which is why my suggestion on retrospect wasn't a good one. If you're a more advanced photographer? Maybe. But for a new one? the 100-400 is a great option and will solve the problems he asked about and the ones we're trying to solve for him...)</p>

<p>You're going to be in situations where tripods are going to be unrealistic. That generally means you should lean towards an IS lens over a faster non-IS lens.</p>

<p>Something not covered by others here: you're going to Africa. You have to carry all this gear. For an experienced photographer, renting a 500mm and hauling it to Africa is do-able. for a new person who's never done this before? That can be a challenge. Remember, you don't want to pack it, it has to carry on (with all your other photo and electronics gear you don't want to disappear), and that turns into a hassle fast.</p>

<p>My thought: buy the 24-105 lens. It's a good all around lens. The 70-200F4 is a good second lens that goes well with it. You can put a 1.4x teleconverter on it to push it to 320 F5.6 and it'll work okay. </p>

<p>But what I'd consider doing for this trip: RENT the 70-200 F2.8L IS II and a 2.0X teleconverter and use those instead of the 70-200 F4. the 70-200 F2.8Lis a lot bigger and heavier than the F4, but it's faster, and the IS II version handles a 2.0x tele fine, so you get that extra reach with a 400 F5.6 equivalent, and it's a really sharp combo. (note: IS II, not the older IS. the older IS isn't sharp enough to use like this).</p>

<p>Even better, you do that without adding a big, heavy third lens to your setup, saving you a hunk of weight and hassle. My pack (7D, T3i, 24-105, 70-200F2.8L IS II, 20.x) lives in a backpack with all of the other stuff you need to carry and weighs in at just under 20 pounds. If you add a 400mm or 500mm prime, you'll need a bigger pack that might not fit carryon capabilities (or a second person to also carry camera gear in a second pack), and you're now well over 25 pounds of gear headed towards 30 pounds. </p>

<p>So don't just think about what lenses, think about where this person is going and what they need to do to get there. Which makes it even more complicated. you certainly odn't want to BUY the big, heavy 70-200, but this is a perfect opportunity to rent one and solve the weight/bulk problem while still getting a reasonably big hunk of glass that goes to 400mm.</p>

<p>(and then I'd probably but the 70-200F4 as my every day lens when I got back... It's great, unless you need to push it to 400mm with a teleconverter...)</p>

"Astrophotography picture with too much noise. How do I correct this in postprocessing?","9329","","<p>This is the Milky Way above Kakadu National Park, Australia, and my first try at astrophotography.</p>

<p>Thirty second exposure, f/4.0 at 17mm with ISO 12800 (!!) which in hindsight probably was way too high and resulted in a lot of noise. I also used Picasa to increase contrast, but I probably went a bit overboard there as well.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ehfsp2t8v7dzag/IMG_8362.CR2"" rel=""noreferrer"">This is the original RAW file (.CR2)</a>, I am looking for input on how to better postprocess this picture to reduce noise.</p>
","<p>Firstly had you lowered the ISO whilst staying at 30s f/4 you wouldn't have ended up with any less noise. </p>

<p>There's probably nothing you could have done to prevent the noise, I presume f/4.0 was the maximum aperture and if you went any longer than 30 seconds you would get star trails. You might even get less noise if you raise the ISO <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/12480/is-high-iso-useful-for-photography"">but that's another story</a>. </p>

<p>However there's plenty you could do to rescue the image, the main thing is <strong>reducing chroma (colour) noise</strong>. Most noise reduction plug-ins as well as RAW converters give you the option of reducing only colour noise.</p>

<p>Here is the image with some brute force chroma noise reduction (split to LAB in GIMP and then Gaussian blur of 250 to the A and B channels):</p>

<p>The noise reduction has also fixed the magenta cast caused by noise in the red channel. A dedicated noise reduction plugin could do much better than this. A little luminance noise reduction would help too, but not too much in case it mistakes the stars for noise.</p>

"How does a fly-by-wire focusing lens work?","9308","","<p>I have learnt that <em>fly-by-wire focusing</em> is an electrical manual focusing system. But how does this focusing method work?</p>

<ul>
<li>How do you manually focus with fly-by-wire?</li>
<li>What is the scope of this focusing method?</li>
<li>Which cameras have this feature?</li>
</ul>
","<p><strong>Function:</strong>
Normally the focus ring is mechanically connected to the inside of the lens so that when you turn the focus ring some of the lenses inside the lens move directly. With focus-by-wire the movement of the focus ring is measured electronically, and then a motor moves the lenses inside. </p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
As focussing is now only possible when the lens has power, it is impossible to focus, when the camera is switched off. And for macro work special extension tubes are needed, which have electrical coupling to allow for power and communication between the lens and camera. 
Also with macro reverse adaptors (and unpowered extension tubes) the only way to focus is by changing the distance between camera and subject.</p>

<p><strong>Lenses which support focus-by-wire:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Most AF lenses for mirrorless cameras support focus-by-wire.</li>
<li>Nearly all Panasonic and and Olympus FourThirds and Micro-FourThirds AF lenses feature only focus-by-wire (with the exception of the M.Zuiko 12mm/2.0, which features additionally a true direct coupling between the focus ring and the lenses inside).</li>
<li>All Canon EOS-M lenses.</li>

"What does a black reflector do?","9290","","<p>I'm familiar with using white / silver / gold reflectors to add fill light to a photo.  When would you use a black ""reflector""?</p>
","<p>To remove light.</p>

<p>If you're shooting outside, or in a place where there's lots of background light being bounced around, it might not be enough to place an item to create a shadow onto your object, since light reflected off of that item might still give you tints or light you don't want.</p>

<p>A black ""reflector"" creates shadow and doesn't reflect light (or as much light, depending on the quality) onto your object, which might help you darken it.</p>

<p>For instance, if you're trying to take a portrait outside, and the face gets a bit too much light on one side, a black reflector might help you reduce that by both creating a ""shadow"" by blocking light, and not reflecting any light onto that side of the face.</p>

"Can I use a remote shutter / bulb mode on a Canon T4i?","9253","","<p>I'd like to shoot fireworks with my Canon Rebel T4i (EOS 650D&nbsp;/ Kiss X6i). Is there a bulb mode on this camera? What different remote-shutter attachments are available?</p>
","<p>To use <em>Bulb</em> mode on your T4i, Select <em>Manual &lt;<strong>M</strong>></em> exposure mode and move the shutter speed past 30 seconds to <em>bulb</em>. (pp. 113-114 of the T4i <em><a href=""http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300007695/01/eosrt4i-eos650d-im-c-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instruction Manual</a></em>)</p>

<p>The simplest way to shoot fireworks with your Rebel T4i is with a wired remote. The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00004WCID"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canon RS60 E3</a> sells at <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00004WCID"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amazon.com</a> for around $22USD. Generic versions are available for about 1/2 that. The advantages of the wired vs. wireless remotes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wired remote will work from beside or behind the camera. The wireless remotes are infrared and need line of sight to the sensor in the front of the camera. Sometimes when indoors you can bounce the wireless remote's signal off a wall, but outdoors, such as when shooting fireworks, the remote must be in front of the camera to trigger the release.</li>
<li>The wired remote includes the ability to do a half-press as well as a full release of the shutter button, just as if you were using the shutter button on the camera body. The wireless remotes don't.</li>
<li>All of the wireless remotes except the RC-6 require a two-second delay before releasing the shutter. Even with the RC-6, a second press is required to close the shutter in <em>Bulb</em> mode. Getting the remote within line of sight of the remote sensor without entering the frame of the photo can be problematic with wider angle lenses.</li>
<li>It can be difficult to keep track of when the shutter is open and when it is not with the RC-6 when using it for Bulb mode in the dark since the same action opens and closes the shutter. With the wired remote it is simple: the shutter is open when the button is pressed all the way down and it is closed at all other times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Radio operated remotes that connect to the camera's wired remote port also share the advantages listed above.</p>

<p>From the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to disagree with your assessment of the wireless triggers. I have used an RC-1 for 7 years and I don't have to put my hand in front of the camera lens or anywhere near it. It also has the option to fire immediately or with a 2 second delay. The delay is really only useful when you are actually in the picture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RC-1 is no longer produced by Canon. It was supplanted by the RC-6. All of the RC-x remotes are infrared and the sensor on all Canon cameras that have one is on the front of the camera. If you are indoors it will often work by bouncing off walls if you are behind or beside the camera. Outdoors is an entirely different matter. The angle of operation is fairly narrow, and the brighter the ambient light, the closer you must be and the narrower the angle you must use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The push to keep open is really not a big advantage either (I would say just a personal preference), and would be a pain for longer exposures (several minutes or more) since you have to hold it the whole time. Push to open and coming back 15 minutes later and push to close would be a distinct advantage when shooting something like star trails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also lock the button down on the wired remote by sliding the button forward and it will hold itself until you slide it back down so the button can come up. The shutter will stay open by itself until the locked button is released, the camera's battery is depleted, or the sensor overheats.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You still don't have to put your hand in front of the lens, no more so than my hand would be from holding the camera. The receiver is on the grip and you simply need to hold the remote near that spot. I simply open the shutter by putting my hand near the side of the camera, well out of range of the lens, even in daylight. The wired remote really only has the advantage of being used from behind the camera, which I would say is rarely a restriction for the photographer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shutter half press is not possible with any of the wireless remotes. The wired remotes also have an advantage there. You also have the option of using mirror lockup with a wired cable release. Canon's pro cameras don't even have an infrared receiver so obviously the wired release works with those cameras and the infrared remotes do not.</p>

<p>I've got both, and I use the wired remote on at least a weekly basis most of the time. The last time I used the RC-6 was over a year ago. The ability to use the viewfinder without touching the tripod mounted camera by performing a half press to activate the AF and viewfinder info display while holding the release in my hand well away from the camera is much more comfortable to me than trying to reach around without touching anything and hold the remote in front of the receiver while looking through the viewfinder to take a picture without the possibility of a half-press first.</p>

"Is there any reason to place polarizer filter before ND graduated one?","9250","","<p>Is there any reason to place polarizer filter before (the first in stack) ND or/and ND graduated one (for example as we can see on Lee 105 mm ring)? Is there any <em>technical</em> reason to do that or it's a useability or marketing issue(s)?</p>
","<p>The polarizer needs to be able to rotate independently of other filters. Square/rectangular system filters only have one other filter type, the graduated/split filters, that needs to be rotated at all. The entire filter holder can be rotated to accommodate the angle required for the split/graduated filter. But what do you do when the horizon (or whatever line is dividing the split/grad filter use) is different from the angle you need to set the polarizer to?</p>

<p>Note that the square filter catalog includes a polarizer. If you don't need to use a split/grad filter (whether that's a neutral density, colour correction or colour effect filter), you can use a square polarizer anywhere in the filter stack. If you intend to use a split/grad, then you need to mount the polarizer in such a way that it can be rotated independently. In the Lee 100mm kit case, that means attaching a filter ring to the front of the holder (or the front of the hood). Why not use a special mount for the split/grad? Because you need to change the position of the rectangular split/grad filter as well as the angle, so it needs to use a regular slot in the holder.</p>

<p>(In the past, a square filter holder with a worm-gear-driven polarizer was available. That may have been for the similar Cokin system; it was a long time ago and my memory ain't what it used to be. In any casse, that could be put anywhere in the stack, but there was a problem: it took forever to adjust, and was quite fragile.)</p>

I was wondering which of those lenses perform better on the wide end area and which one is better value for money, since it will be used as secondary, probably 30% of time. I tend to shoot in low light, street locations and I am wondering if there is a huge difference from f/4 to f/2.8. Not looking for details, just for something that gets the job done nicely.</p>
","<p>A lot depends on which 24-70mm f/2.8 lens you are comparing to the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS.</p>

<p>There are three very good 24-70mm f/2.8 lenses you could consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8 L II</strong> This lens is the most expensive at a little over $2,000 U.S., but is the sharpest from 24mm all the way to 70mm at f/2.8. At the wide end where you want to use it there isn't a lot of difference between it and the other two 24-70 lenses listed below.</li>
<li><strong>Tamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC</strong> This lens is a great value that hangs with the Canon ""II"" until between about 35mm and 50mm. From there to 70mm when both are wide open at f/2.8 the Canon is sharper, but not by a lot. But this lens also includes <em>Vibration Control (VC)</em>, Tamron's version of <em>IS</em>. It sells for around $1,300 US and is an excellent value. I have seen it for as low as $1,000 U.S, during recent special promotions and is very attractive at that price.</li>
<li><strong>Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8 L</strong> This is the older version of the Canon. While very good, it is a step behind both the Canon ""II"" and the new Tamron at longer focal lengths when used wide open at f/2.8. Used prices vary, but in general they are higher than the Tamron (and the going price when this lens was in production), but lower than the Canon ""II"".</li>
</ul>

<p>At 24mm and f/2.8 all of theses lenses perform very well and close to each other. The older Canon is not quite as sharp in the center, but is just as sharp at the edges.
When used at f/2.8, the Canon II starts to pull away from the Tamron and older Canon somewhere between 35mm and 50mm. The most difference between these lenses is at 70mm and f/2.8 where the ""II"" is clearly sharper, especially on the edges. At f/4 there is very little difference between the Canon ""II"" and the Tamron until between 50mm and 70mm. By f/5.6 there is no real difference between any of these three lenses at or below 50mm, but the older Canon is a little softer on the edges above 50mm. There is no real difference between the Canon ""II"" and the Tamron at f/5.6 or narrower at any focal length. <a href=""http://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Compare/Side-by-side/Canon-EF-24-70mm-F28L-II-USM-versus-Tamron-SP-24-70mm-F28-Di-VC-USD-Canon-versus-EF24-70mm-f-2.8L-USM__886_0_884_0_165_0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Side-by-side comparison of theses three lenses at DxO Mark</a>.

The left of the chart is center sharpness, the right is edge sharpness. You can also compare vignetting, chromatic aberration, distortion, and T-stop values this way.</p>

<p>The <strong>Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS</strong> is the other lens you mentioned. It is my favorite ""walk around"" lens. At 24mm and f/4 it is just as sharp as the Canon 24-70 II or the Tamron 24-70 from the center out to about 40% of the frame (almost the entire frame on an APS-C body) and then slightly softer from there to the edges. At 35mm there is no real difference at f/4. But from 50mm and above the 24-105 looses ground to both the Canon II and the Tamron 24-70. It is still very good, just not quite at the same level as the 24-70 lenses. The good news is that from 70m to 105mm the sharpness of this lens stays fairly constant and gives you a little more reach than the 24-70mm lenses do. <a href=""http://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Compare/Side-by-side/Canon-EF-24-70mm-F28L-II-USM-on-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-III-versus-Tamron-SP-24-70mm-F28-Di-VC-USD-Canon-on-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-III-versus-EF24-105mm-f-4L-IS-USM__886_795_884_795_164_0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Side-by-side comparison of the Canon 24-70 II, the Tamron 24-70, and the Canon 24-105 at DxO Mark</a>. Please see the instructions above regarding the other comparison.</p>

<p><strong>For your stated purpose of shooting at focal lengths below 50mm, the best value would either be the Tamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC or the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS.</strong> The Canon II doesn't give you that much more performance in terms of IQ until about 50mm and above, it lacks <em>IS</em>, and costs twice as much. Both The Tamron 24-70 and the Canon 24-105 have very good image stabilization. If you shop around and can wait for promotions that have been fairly frequent for both lenses lately the Canon is a little cheaper at around $800, the Tamron gives you f/2.8 for about $200 more. Since you say you tend to shoot in low light I'd go for the Tamron if I were you.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This answer was written based on the assumption you are using a Canon Full Frame body. If you are shooting APS-C, the ideal lens for your stated usage would be the <strong>Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS</strong>. It is sharper than the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS and the list price for it has been recently lowered by Canon. It can be had for around $830 U.S. It is every bit the optical match of its ""L"" series cousins, but Canon does not designate any of their EF-S lenses as ""L"" glass.</p>

"How to proceed after having developed the negatives?","9198","","<p>There are a lot of <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/9810/5032"">excellent</a> <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/q/12825/5032"">questions</a> (and answers!) about the process of developing (BW) film at home. I would like to try my hand at it, too. </p>

<p>But it's not exactly clear how to proceed after having developed the negatives (in the second question, @whuber says: ""Then you're all ready to make a contact sheet and proceed to enlarge them...but that's a topic for another day."").</p>

<p>One possibility could be to scan them and then proceed as if they were raw images from a dslr.
But this is obviously not the <em>classical</em> solution. So, how do you actually go from the developed negative to a printed photo?</p>

<p>As an aside, considering the scanner option (which would probably be easier for a beginner): I have read that a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi  is ""good enough"" for some definition of enough. In particular, I would like to know if it is good enough <strong>to preserve the grain of the film</strong> (otherwise, where's the point of it?)</p>
","<p>Once you have the negative you use an <em>enlarger</em> to create your prints.  An enlarger has a head containing a bulb, a negative holder and a lens.  The head is on a column attached to a base.  You can raise the head away from the base to make the image larger (or turn the head to project the image onto a wall for large prints)</p>

<p>If you want to do a contact sheet, you cut your negative into strips to match the size of your paper, and lay them on top of the photographic paper (in contact with the paper, hence ""contact sheet"").  You put a piece of glass over the top to keep the negatives flat and in place.  You turn on the enlarger bulb to expose the paper, and then develop it with a similar mix of chemicals you used for the negatives (developer, stop bath and fixer)</p>

<p>Once you have your contact sheet to review, and decide to make a full sized print.  You load a negative strip into the holder in the enlarger.  You turn on the bulb and focus the image onto an empty easel (which holds the paper in place).  Once focused, turn off the enlarger, and load the paper into the easel. Then you turn on the bulb once again to expose.  Usually the enlarger is connected to a timer.</p>

<p>To get the correct exposure takes some trial and error.  Generally you cut up strips of paper (so as not to waste entire sheets) and use these as test strips.  You cover most of the strip up with your hand or a piece of cardboard.  You expose for say a total of 60 seconds - every 10 seconds you uncover a bit more of the strip, so that when you are done, you have sections that have been exposed for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and the full 60 seconds.  You can then develop and view the test strip in full light to judge what the correct exposure should be.  Then you put in your 8x10 paper and expose for that amount of time.</p>

"What is Aliasing and Anti-Aliasing?","9180","","<p>What is Aliasing and Anti-Aliasing? Is it a bad thing to have in an image? If so how to avoid it? </p>

<p>If you can describe your answer using examples then that would be great. </p>
","<p>Aliasing means quite a few different things. They're all generally related (effects from digital sampling) but in different situations, it takes considerably different forms. For example, even though they're both digital graphics, what you see with a digital camera is considerably different than what you see in computer generated graphics (and both are entirely different from aliasing in digital audio).</p>

<p>The kind of aliasing you deal with in digital photography happens when detail in the image, when projected onto the sensor is roughly the same size or smaller than a single pixel in the sensor.</p>

<p>This can lead to Moire patterns and false color in the image. Just for example, let's assume there was an extremely fine white line across the image. If its width (as projected on the sensor) is smaller than the width of a sensor well, then it will show up as the color(s) of the sensor wells it happens to be projected on, rather than the actual color of the light. Even though it contains (we'll assume) exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, its small size prevents it from affecting all three colors of sensors equally, so it only shows up as the colors of the sensor wells it happens to strike.</p>

<p>Moire patterns (another artifact of aliasing) happen from interference between detail in the subject matter, and the grid of the sensor. This one is pretty easy to show: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SIq16.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The diagonal ""stripe"" patterns are from interference between the grid of the LCD I was taking a picture of, and the grid of the sensor wells in the camera. When I look at the screen, I don't see anything like that, but when taking a picture of the screen with a digital camera, it's hard to avoid.</p>

<p>Though most people don't take pictures of LCD screens a lot, other subjects with fine detail can as well, especially if it follows a grid-like pattern. Cloth, for one example, is notorious for causing problems, especially with cameras that don't have antialiasing filters.</p>

<p>As far as what you do it about it, you use an antialiasing filter. An antialiasing filter is basically just a low-pass filter, that limits the frequency you sample to something below the ""Nyquist limit"" for the sampling you're doing. In the case of a digital camera, that's a few sheets of glass almost directly in front of the sensor, that blur the image ever so slightly. The intent is to ensure that the finest dot of light projected on the sensor will cover at one complete red/green/blue sensor group.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, this is a bit of a balancing game. If you blur the image too much, customers will be unhappy because the images aren't ""sharp"". If you blur it too little, they'll be unhappy because of aliasing artifacts. In most cases, you can get aliasing artifacts in extreme cases (e.g., the camera I used to take the picture above has an AA filter), and of course people still wish the pictures were sharper.</p>

<p>In a few cases (e.g., Nikon D800 vs. D800E) they've simply let the customer pick their poison, so to speak. To an extent, you get the same choice between typical DLSRs (most have AA filters) and medium format cameras (most don't).</p>

<p>I should add that without an AA filter, aliasing can lead to ""false detail"" -- what looks like extremely fine detail in the image, but is really just a sampling artifact. This can give a result that looks impressively sharp -- but some of that detail has almost no basis in reality at all.</p>

"is there a real difference between ""digital"" and ""film"" lenses?","9171","","<p>I'm looking at the <a href=""http://www.sigmaphoto.com/product/20mm-f18-ex-dg-asp-rf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sigma 20mm F1.8 EX DG ASP RF</a> lens right now to use on a 35mm film Camera (Nikon N80).</p>

<p>The DG stands for ""Digital Full Frame"" according to Sigma, but they don't say what the ""digital"" really means. (Related, when you look at the <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Camera-Lenses/index.page#c54-CID-1380035722687-tab-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nikon website</a> they say ""View all D-SLR Lenses"" with no indication of Film)</p>

<p>Does the ""Digital"" really mean anything if it's a Full Frame lens (as opposed to a Crop or m43), or is this just marketing talk to make people buy new lenses with their digital cameras?</p>
","<p>Yes, lenses designed for digital sensors have several differences from their older film based camera lens counterparts.  One of the primary differences is that digital sensors are more reflective than film, so anti-reflective coatings are applied to the rear element of a digital lens.  This helps prevent reflections off the sensor that could result in image ghosting.</p>

<p>Additionally, digital sensors require light to travel down a narrow tube produced by the stack of filters (color, AA, etc) that lie directly in front of the actual photosites that convert the light energy hitting the sensor in to an electronic signal.  This alters the way that the light needs to be directed to the sensor (it needs to come in from more straight on) and digital lenses may be designed to handle this better.</p>

<p>Finally, as Michael Clark pointed out, film didn't generally lie perfectly flat, while digital sensors do, so there is more emphasis on extreme levels of sharp resolving power on good digital lenses than film cared about.</p>

<p>It isn't generally a problem to use an old film lens as long as it is compatible with your camera mount system, but it is good to understand the caveats that they can have ghosting problems when shooting in to light, they often have lower sharpness and may have additional chromatic aberrations.  They also tend to be older, so they may lack some of the more recent advantages in terms of focus motors and control.</p>

<p>My general recommendation if you are buying new and can afford it, then buy a modern lens, but if you need the capabilities of an expensive lens (such as a fast lens) cheaply, then it may be worth picking up an old film lens and working around the limitations, just make sure to research the particular lens you are looking at and how it compares to other lenses of both similar prices and similar aperture and focal length.</p>

<p>""135 ÷ 18 = <strong>7.5</strong>"" and ""300 ÷ 70 = <strong>4.2</strong>""?</p>
","<p>As you've pointed out, the question is meaningless in absolute terms. People whose exposure to photography starts and ends with point-and-shoot cameras don't really know what the term means.</p>

<p>They'll be thinking in terms of compact cameras, and the ""zoom"" on those goes from a moderate wide angle (about the 20mm mark on your lens, which is about 32mm equivalent on a full-frame sensor) as ""1"" to some multiple. The long end of your telephoto zoom is 300mm, or about ""15x"" in terms they'll understand.</p>

<p>If they seem disappointed that all you get is ""15x"" with that ""huge"" lens, you can always mention that there's an accessory you can get to go to 80x (that'd be the 800mm f/5.6 with a 2x teleconverter, and together they're about the price of an ""entry level"" automobile, but you don't need to mention that part).

"Multiple exposures vs. adjusting exposure of single RAW?","9167","","<p>For HDR, it's recommended to use auto exposure bracketing.  However, an advantage of RAW is the ability to adjust exposure.  Even Trey Ratcliff has said, <a href=""http://500px.com/blog/750/tutorial-learn-hdr-photography"" rel=""noreferrer"">""you can make a good HDR photo from a single RAW""</a>.</p>

<p>My question is, what's the advantage of shooting multiple exposures as opposed to taking one RAW and tweaking its exposure?  (There must be an advantage, otherwise no one would bother with the significant limitations of AEB.)</p>

<p>I am looking for an explanation that discusses exactly what happens when one adjusts the exposure value of a RAW (is information lost?), and how that differs from what the camera records during a longer exposure.</p>
","<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging is all about <em>dynamic range</em>. That is a way of describing the difference between the darkest and brightest parts of a scene we wish to photograph. Each <strong><em>stop</em></strong> is double the light of the previous one. A scene with, for example, 6 stops dynamic range has highlights that are 64 times as bright as the shadows.</p>

<p>Any JPEG, regardless of how it was produced, is limited to about 6 stops of dynamic range. Each color channel uses 8-bits, but about two of those bits are taken up by what is known as the <em>noise floor</em>. Most current DSLRs and other advanced digital cameras record either 12 or 14 bit RAW files with 10 to 12 stops of dynamic range at their base ISO sensitivity. What HDR (High Dynamic Range) Imaging attempts to do is squeeze as much dynamic range as possible into the 8-bits for each color channel in the JPEG standard.</p>

<p>As we mentioned above, most advanced digital cameras can record 10-12 stops of dynamic range in a single exposure. To get the same amount of information in a series of JPEG files you would need one exposure three stops darker and one exposure three stops brighter than a 'correct' exposure. Since there would be very little overlap between the darkest parts of the bright exposure and the brightest parts of the dark exposure we would also need to add a third exposure in the middle between the other two. This is where the -3, 0, +3 series of bracketed exposures to use in HDR processing comes from. So in most cases a properly exposed single RAW file can contain as much information as a -3, 0, +3 series of JPEGs.</p>

<p>But some scenes contain even more than the 10-12 stops of dynamic range a single RAW file can record. If we shoot a series of RAW files we can expand the total amount of information from the darkest to the brightest parts of the scene even more. By shooting a -3, 0, +3 series of RAW files, we can add an additional 6 stops of dynamic range for a total of 16-18 stops! That means that the brightest exposure records highlights that are 262,144 times as bright as the shadows in the darkest exposure. The more intermediate steps of exposure we have, the better the software we use to combine the images can do so smoothly.</p>

"How is the YCbCr color space represented in a JPEG image?","9144","","<p>I know that a 24 bit image dedicates 8 bit each for R, G and B. Is it just for RGB color space. In YCbCr color space for a 24 bit JPEG image, how are the bits distributed? </p>
","<p>There are a few formats for YCbCr. generally speaking the eye is more sensitive to changes in luminance (Y, brightness) than to changes in chroma (Cb, Cr, color). Thus, it is possible to erase some chroma information while retaining image quality.</p>

<p>Thus, the most ""expensive"" format is 4:4:4, where for each luma (Y) component there are 1 Red difference (Cr) and one Blue difference (Cb) components.</p>

<p>Then, applying the principle I mentioned, there is 4:2:2 where for each 2 Y components there are 1 Cb and 1 Cr. And it goes even further to 4:1:1 and 4:2:0, etc. More info <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4:2:2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest disadvantage is that you don't have the wireless tethering feature that the high-end adapters provide.  There are options though, you can look into something like onOne's DSLR Remote, which uses a USB tether to a laptop, and then you use your iPhone or iPad to remotely control and use Live View to frame your shots.  This works really well when framing group shots, and you're out in front of the camera arranging the group, or you're actually in the shot.

","<p>The Nikon mount is far older than the Canon one. Nikon have updated their old (OLD!) manual focus lens mount continously, adding new mechanical and electronic connections to it over the years to support new features. Canon started with a blank sheet of paper on their EOS mount in the late eighties and did not even try to maintain backwards compatibility. The main difference is that the EOS mount is all-electronic, there is no mechanical linkage whatsoever between camera body and lens. The Nikon mount has a mechanical stopdown linkage and a mechanical autofocus linkage to let an in-camera AF motor drive the AF mechanism in the lens, plus a full set of electronic linkages á la Canon. The consequence is that an old Canon manual-focus lens is now a useless paperweight while any old Nikon manual focus lens can, in principle (there are some gotchas), be mounted and used on the latest and greatest Nikon DSLR.</p>

<p>Also, the Canon mount has a shorter flange distance and a wider opening. The short flange means that there is room for an adapter to fit lenses with other mounts, the wide opening means that making ultra-large aperture lenses like 50mm f/1 and 85mm f/1.2 is possible. Nikon only goes to 50/1.2 and 85/1.4... whether this difference means much in practice is debatable :)</p>

"Why are SLR mechanisms still prevalent among high-end digital cameras?","9130","","<p>I understand that back in the days when cameras captured images using photographic film instead of image sensors, the SLR design was a major innovation.  It let you see through the viewfinder exactly the light that would be passed on to the film.  Assuming you care about accurate photography, that's kind of a big deal.  </p>

<p>Nowadays, however, cameras that use film are essentially specialist/niche products, and the vast majority of photography is done using digital cameras.  And with a digital camera, you don't need a hinged mirror as you can show the user exactly what light will be captured by just routing the sensor output to an LCD display.  Having a mechanical component that needs to be able to move around in a very precise manner and can break or fail seems like a very large liability.  That leads me to some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do manufacturers continue to build SLR mechanisms into their digital cameras, particularly at the top-end of their product lines?</li>
<li>Why do photographers seem to heavily prefer DSLR cameras over digital point-and-shoot models that offer the same features but without the SLR mechanism (there are, for instance, full-frame point-and-shoot interchangeable lens cameras available, though it's not clear if they're very popular among photographers), to the point where ""DSLR"" is almost synonymous with ""serious photographer's camera""?</li>
<li>Is there any significant benefit to having an SLR mechanism in a digital camera?  Particularly in terms of a benefit that's large enough to make up for the liability of adding a mechanical part into a design where a solid-state alternative is available?</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>And with a digital camera, you don't need a hinged mirror as you can show the user exactly what light will be captured by just routing the sensor output to an LCD display.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the reason for the rise in popularity of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras (MILC). Without the mirror box, the camera can be smaller, lighter, less expensive, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having a mechanical component that needs to be able to move around in a very precise manner and can break or fail seems like a very large liability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not as much as you'd think. These same companies have been building SLR's with mirror boxes for decades, and they've gotten pretty good at it. There may be occasional mechanical failures, but at this point the mechanisms tend to last a lot longer than the useful lifetime of the camera. In other words, customers will want to replace the camera for other reasons (e.g. better sensors, more features, etc.) before the mirror mechanism fails.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do manufacturers continue to build SLR mechanisms into their digital cameras, particularly at the top-end of their product lines?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main reason has to be that it's what customers want. DSLR's evolved from film SLR's, and photographers still want to buy cameras that let them see what they're shooting through the lens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do photographers seem to heavily prefer DSLR cameras over digital point-and-shoot models that offer the same features but without the SLR mechanism</p>

<p>You answered this yourself pretty well: <em>It let you see through the viewfinder exactly the light that would be passed on to the film. Assuming you care about accurate photography, that's kind of a big deal.</em></p>

<p>If you're not looking through the lens, you're seeing some digital interpretation of what the scene looks like. Electronic viewfinders (EVF) have improved tremendously in recent years, and they do have the potential to show you what the sensor will record, but that's not the same thing as seeing what's visible through the lens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(there are, for instance, full-frame point-and-shoot interchangeable lens cameras available, though it's not clear if they're very popular among photographers), to the point where ""DSLR"" is almost synonymous with ""serious photographer's camera""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are definitely ""serious photographers"" who have switched to MILC's. David Hobby and Zack Arias are two examples of well-known photographers that use Fuji mirrorless cameras. However...</p>

<p>There's a lot of inertia that will need to be overcome in order for DSLR's to really lose popularity among professional photographers. Lenses present a huge obstacle -- photographers already have large investments in lenses, and manufacturers have large existing lines of excellent (and profitable!) lenses for their DSLR lines. If photographers start jumping ship from Nikon or Canon to Fuji or Sony, and if Fuji and Sony can provide lenses that the pros need, then Nikon and Canon will surely start producing more top-end lenses designed for (and not merely adapted to) their mirrorless lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any significant benefit to having an SLR mechanism in a digital camera? Particularly in terms of a benefit that's large enough to make up for the liability of adding a mechanical part into a design where a solid-state alternative is available?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I think you may be overstating the liability of the mechanical system. These things work really well. So, let's turn your question around and look at the other side: <em>Is there any significant benefit to changing the reliable and well-understood DSLR design?</em> Obviously, the answer is <em>yes</em>, because MILC's are getting some real traction in the marketplace, but at the same time the answer is not <em>YES!!!</em>, probably because the liability is not as great as you imagine.</p>

<p>My own feeling is that a much more interesting question is: <em>Will DSLR's ever get electronic shutters that could give them much higher flash sync speeds, faster burst modes, and faster shutter speeds?</em> I think you'll see that happen before MILC's unseat DSLR's.</p>

The only thing I can think of is that it is measuring the number of pixels per linear inch on my camera sensor. That would explain why it shows up in image software as an attribute of the photo.</p>

<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>If it is, then it seems to me that the number of pixels is more important than the PPI in determining how large a print you can produce from a given digital image. Is that right as well?</p>
","<p>Pixels per inch (PPI) is strictly concerned with the output resolution, and the value attached to a particular image file is only a suggestion.</p>

<p>The image file itself is composed of a set number of discrete pixels, which are to a picture what atoms are to molecules. Unless and until you change the number of pixels, the image quality when the image is displayed at the same size on the same output medium will remain the same. If you tell your printer to print a given image file at a certain fixed size (say 8x10 inches, for the sake of argument), it doesn't matter in the slightest whether the resolution tag in the image file says it's a 72PPI image or a 300PPI image; if the file is otherwise identical (that is, if it contains the same pixels in the same colour space), the prints will be identical. In the same way, a 1000 by 1500 pixel image will display at the same size on a web page (barring CSS or HTML scaling, which can stretch or squish the image, usually with a significant loss in quality).</p>

<p>Yes, you do generally want higher PPI values for output when you can get them (up to a limit -- if the resolution is higher than the output device can support, you'll actually lose quality), but that means printing larger image files at smaller physical sizes, or displaying the image on a screen with more tightly-packed pixels (which amounts to the same thing). You may need to calculate the appropriate number of pixels for output, which does involve PPI, but that is usually to match the output device's resolution, the desired print size, and the image file.</p>

<p>(If you want to print to a dye-sub or ""light-jet"" printer, you'll get the best quality if the pixels in your image match the printer's pixels. If the printer prints at 400PPI, and you want your image to print at 16""x20"", it ought to be a 6400x8000 pixel image, otherwise the printer will have to scale it for you, and that doesn't always go well.)</p>

<p>The PPI value embedded in the file is used mostly in pre-print processing applications to determine the image size. That includes things like desktop publishing apps (e.g. Adobe InDesign), third-party raster image processors (RIPs), and multi-up gang printing applications that have to figure out how best to minimize paper waste. 300PPI is pretty much industry standard for prepress work, and image sizing is usually done in an image editing application to minimize scaling artifacts and optimize sharpening, etc.</p>

"""One size fits all lens"" for Sony and Nikon, or a Nikon lens plus adapter?","9105","","<p>I've been taking photos with the supplied kit lens with my Sony Alpha 200 for the last couple of years. I'm looking at changing the body to a Nikon D7000 at some point in the future and I'm also looking at getting a 50mm prime lens. </p>

<p>My question is, which lens can I buy that would fit a Sony Alpha 200 and also a Nikon D7000? Should I get a Nikon lens and a lens adapter or is there some form of 'one-size-fits-all' lens?</p>
","<p><strong>There is no such thing as a universal lens.</strong> The shape of the connection, position of the contacts (and electric protocol too), distance between the connector and sensor are all different.</p>

<p><strong>There are adapters to bridge the gap which are mostly used for legacy lenses.</strong> The reason is that with those adapters you will lose most communication between the body and lens, so you have to focus manual, probably have to set aperture manually and sometimes will have to use the camera in Manual mode only (no metering).</p>

<p>There two extremely important points to note above:
- If the lens you use (such as ALL kit lenses for DSLRs) does NOT have an aperture ring, you will only be able to shoot at one aperture (usually either the smallest or the largest).
- If you adapt a lens who is supposed to sit closer to sensor, it will be be able to focus very far and you will almost certainly lose infinity focus.</p>

<p>Given all this and my understanding that your lens investment is minimal, I would recommend simply buying the lenses you need for your new camera.</p>

"What makes a photo a good photo?","9076","","<p>I don't know if this is a stupid question, this just came across my mind.</p>

<p>Imagine a photo of a dog yawning.</p>

<p>Someone could say that is a very good photo as it is taken just at the right moment, from a perfect angle (eg. level with the dog) and it has a shallow depth of field focusing on its face.</p>

<p>Someone else might dislike it because unfortunately the dog is ugly.</p>

<p>So from that example I could say people look at the following elements when judging a photo (but I could be wrong):</p>

<ul>
<li>The timing (if it's taken at the right moment)</li>
<li>The angle it's taken from (composition?)</li>
<li>DOF (composition?)</li>
<li>The subject (eg. whether the dog is pretty)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am interested to know what experts think the elements you look at when judging whether a photo is a good photo.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your comments.</p>
","<p>First off, what makes a ""good photo"" is something ultimately subjective, and its hard to say exactly. There are some guidelines that you can follow help you determine what a good photo are:</p>

<p><strong>A good photo:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Makes effective use of light</strong>

<ul>
<li>Photography is the art of ""drawing with light""

<ul>
<li>Photos: Greek for <em>light</em></li>
<li>Graphia: Greek for <em>drawing</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flat, total illumination tends to be rather boring</li>
<li>Plays of shadow and light, warm or cool colors, alternative tints, etc. can make a photo better</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Is properly composed</strong>

<ul>
<li>Shoot just a mountain solo, and even in good lighting, it might just be boring</li>
<li>Shoot a mountain in front of a lake during sunset, with a the husk of an ancient tree silhouetted in the foreground, and you have something considerably more interesting</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Subtracts the unnecessary and enhances the key subject</strong>

<ul>
<li>DOF it is a powerful tool of simplification and can help you compose your shots and isolate your subject</li>
<li>Longer exposures can blur elements with motion, flattening and simplifying them, enhancing the more important aspects of an image</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Is properly focused and appropriately sharp</strong>

<ul>
<li>Lack of focus deemphasizes the subject of your shot</li>
<li>Too much sharpness can hamper the viewers eye, overemphasizing details</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Makes effective use of color, or the lack thereof</strong>

<ul>
<li>Color reflects the world we see and can be a powerful tool to show vision and tell stories</li>
<li>Black &amp; White can bring forth and enhance aspects of an image that just can't be seen when color is present</li>
<li>Monochromatic and split-tone images other than B&amp;W can bring an artistic element to an otherwise boring image</li>
<li>Removal of color can satisfy the ""simplification"" rule when nothing else can </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tells a story or depicts a artistic vision</strong>

<li>A photograph thats just as photograph may be interesting</li>
<li>A photograph that tells a story has more substance</li>

"What makes a camera ""professional"" vs. amateur/hobbyist?","9074","","<p>I will be attending a music festival (Lollapalooza) this weekend, and according to the site's <a href=""http://www.lollapalooza.com/info/faq/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAQ page</a>, attendees are not allowed to bring in ""professional"" recording equipment.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a camera and its equipment ""professional""?  For amateurs and hobbyists?</strong></p>

<p>Is it cost?  The detachable lens?  Would professionals not use point &amp; shoot cameras?  Megapixels?</p>

<p>It's horrible that DSLRs are not being allowed in a public park for these private events to protect the image/copyright of the performers, but what clear distinction can we come to a consensus on as to what is ""professional""?</p>
","<p><strong>It's a meaningless distinction.</strong> It depends on who's saying it, and what's ""professional"" to one venue might not be to another.</p>

<p>In this case, it's pretty clear they won't let you bring in a DSLR, because it has a detachable lens. Good luck educating them on the distinction between prime and zoom.</p>

<p>I totally share your frustration. It's obvious from their ""policy"" that whatever their goals w.r.t. photography are - if they in fact do have coherent goals - they are pretty incompetently expressed. I have no problem with event organizers setting a photography policy, but not if it's incoherent and ignorant of what photography is and what photographers do.</p>

<p>I would love to take pictures of Moon, etc as seen in my telescope using my camera.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do that?</p>
","<p>There's a <a href=""http://www.astronomyforbeginners.com/astrophotography/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">few different ways</a> to do this.  It sounds like you're most interested in afocal or prime focus methods though.  </p>

<p>Afocal photography is putting the camera up to the eyepiece and taking a picture through the eyepiece.  The advantage here is that you get the magnification of the eyepiece, but you lose some quality due to the extra glass the eye piece imparts.</p>

<p>Prime focus photography is where you'll take the eyepiece out and attach the camera with a t ring adapter and a camera to telescope adapter.  The second is basically a eyepiece that a generic t ring thread screws on.  The t ring is a standard thread on one side and a special F mount (for you) on the other side.  Prime focus methods won't get you super high magnifications, but will get you clearer pictures.</p>

<p>There's one problem you'll have with both of these.  <em>The earth is moving.</em>  Yup, spinning around and around.  And while the sky doesn't look like its moving fast, when you try to take a <em>largely magnified</em> picture of it, it is.  To get reasonable pictures with astrophotography you either need to do a <em>much</em> larger field of view than going through your telescope - or get tracking for your telescope/camera.</p>

"How do I prevent condensation on a lens when outdoors?","9012","","<p>I was attempting a time lapse the other evening, outdoors and after a warmish sunny day, with a fairly cool air temp. I set my camera up and set it clicking away and left it for about 3 hours. Most of the time when I checked on it it was perfectly fine. But when I finally went out there was loads of condensation on the lens, glass and barrel, and on the back of the camera too.</p>

<p>I had set my camera up a few hours before it went dark, just to get the framing right, so I assume it was at the ambient temperature. It wasn't in the sunlight, so it could only have cooled down from when I set it up.</p>

<p>Is there a reliable and simple way to stop this happening? I hope so, as it must be a fairly common occurrence. Main reason is I don't want a damp camera as it will do it no good. Second reason is that it will ruin my timelapses!</p>
","<p>You're right, the problem with heating the environment is that it can produce ""heat waves"" which show up in your photographs if you're not very careful. All in all it seemed like bringing a heater (propane, or otherwise) was something that I was going to have to monitor and fiddle with a lot, so I didn't ever go down the path of trying to keep the environmental temperature above the dew point... One of my goals when doing time lapses is to be as automated as possible, so the heater didn't 'pass the test' for me in that regard.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, this is a very common problem in the astronomy world, so it's one area where we can simply borrow liberally from their techniques (and their equipment as well). </p>

<li><p><strong>Lens Sleeve:</strong> On the 'low cost' end of the scale is simply wrapping the front part of your lens.

<li><p><strong>Heat Strap:</strong> One step up the scale (in both sophistication and complexity) is to use a <a href=""http://www.telescope.com/Accessories/Dew-Control/Orion-Dew-Zapper-12V-DC-Heating-Straps/pc/-1/c/3/sc/44/e/17.uts"" rel=""noreferrer"">heating strap</a>. With a heating strap you simply strap it to your lens near the front element and it keeps the glass warm enough that condensation can't form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple Solutions:</strong> If you're expecting really wide temperature swings (depends on your region... Where I live in the spring and fall we can experience 20 to 30 degree swings between day and night), a single heating strap may not be enough. I've had some success with the lens sleeve plus the heating strap, but I finally did bite the bullet a couple years ago and bought a <a href=""http://www.telescope.com/Accessories/Dew-Control/Orion-Dew-Zapper-Pro-4-Channel-Prevention-System/pc/-1/c/3/sc/44/e/22.uts"" rel=""noreferrer"">multi-channel prevention system</a> so I could keep the entire lens warm (not just at the front element). Carrying the idea to its extreme, I've recently done some full-winter day-to-night timelapses here in the northwest where I've been using a full neoprene 'suit' for my entire camera and lens (made myself, cut the pieces from an old wetsuit and sewed them together like a 8-year-old cub scout trying to earn his leatherwork badge at camp! It ain't pretty, but it works...) <em>and</em> a multi-channel heating system together, which worked like a champ. Obviously the downside to this type of solution is its complexity, but for all-night timelapses I'm already hauling car batteries and motorized dolly platforms, so adding another powered item didn't seem like such a big deal. :-)</p></li>

","<p>Others have given advice on digitising which is very worthwhile and I would suggest this should be done as soon as possible.  However, assuming that there is value placed on the photograph itself as a historic object not just the image it contains as a historic record then you will want to do your best to also preserve them as well as you are able.</p>

<p>The National Archives (UK) have published a short guide ""Caring for your photographs"".</p>

<p>To quote the most relevant part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Environment</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Photographic materials benefit from a cool, dry, well-ventilated storage environment. Avoid storing photographs in the attic, the
  basement, or along the outside walls of a building, where
  environmental conditions are prone to extremes and fluctuations and
  where condensation may occur.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Keep photographs and negatives in folders or pockets to protect them from dust and light and provide physical support during use.
  Chemically stable plastic or paper folders or pockets, free of
  sulphur, acids, and peroxides, are recommended. These storage
  materials are not readily available but can be ordered from specialist
  conservation suppliers. Plastics are unsuitable for photographs that
  have a flaking binder layer or friable surface components, such as the
  pastel colouring often seen on crayon enlargements.</p></li>
  <li><p>Store film-based
  negatives (single sheets or strips cut into lengths of 4-6 frames)
  separately from other photographic materials, as they can produce
  acidic gases as they age.</p></li>
  <li><p>Keep cased items, such as daguerreotypes
  and ambrotypes, in their original cases or frames. Wrap them in
  acid-free or photographic storage paper to reduce wear and tear on
  fragile cases.</p></li>
  <li><p>Place individually packed prints, negatives, and
  cased items in sturdy, acid-free or photographic conservation board
  boxes for extra protection from light, dust, and environmental
  fluctuations.</p></li>
  <li><p>Preserve old photograph albums intact, storing them
  flat, preferably in acid-free or photographic conservation board
  boxes. They serve a dual purpose of organising groups of images while
  protecting them from physical and environmental damage, and can be
  wonderful sources of historic and genealogical information.</p></li>
  <li>Check
  stored boxes of photographs from time to time to make sure that they
  are free of dust, dirt and insects.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Although they recommend keeping photos in albums, the plastic sleeves may well be an issue.  I would be inclined to try and remove them and put them into a new acid-free card based album to preserve the order while removing the plastic.</p>

"What is Universal White Balance (UniWB)?","9000","","<p>How and in what kind of situations should it be used?</p>
","<p>For myself the easiest way to understand UniWB was the following.</p>

<p>Most current digital cameras have twice as much green light sensors as they have reds and blues (referenced as RGBG). Now to achieve neutral gray by changing white balance, usually the red and blue channels need to be amplified more than green. Just a few examples (for Canon 350D):</p>

<ul>
<li>Tungsten: multipliers (R) 1.392498 (G) 1.000000 (B) 2.375114</li>
<li>Shade: multipliers (R) 2.531894 (G) 1.000000 (B) 1.223749</li>
</ul>

<p>So when your camera generates JPG based histogram (where your in-camera white balance setting is taken into account regardless the fact you shoot RAW) under tungsten lightning, the blue channel will be shown as clipped far before it actually is. Same goes for red channel using Shade WB.</p>

<p><strong>UniWB's main idea is to set all WB multiplier's to 1, so your histogram is as close to reality as possible and you can achieve optimal exposure.</strong></p>

<p>To use UniWB, simply find a RAW file for your camera, download, copy to your memory card and set the camera's white balance using that photo (most of the modern cameras can set WB based on taken shot). Files for some cameras and a lot more theory can be found <a href=""http://www.guillermoluijk.com/tutorial/uniwb/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at the end of this page</a>.</p>

<p>Be aware that the colors on your camera display will be way off and need correction during RAW conversion. When shooting with UniWB, you'd better use a color target as a reference.</p>

<p>Here is an example shot using UniWB before correction (RGB values of white square are 162, 253, 197):</p>

"How to do a long exposure with a Nikon D60","8994","","<p>I've searched google high and low for this and all I get are results trying to sell me camera equipment.</p>

<p>I have a Nikon D60 without the ML-L3 remote control, well I have one but the battery has run out. It's a marvellous star-lit night tonight but I'm damned if I can work out how to open an exposure on my Nikon D60 then close it again after an amount of time that I determine.</p>

<p>I've read the manual again but can't make head or tail of it. I'm an ex-film 35mm Minolta X300 user, I am having problems transitioning to digital.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me with settings? If I get a decent result I promise to post links.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>As per mattdm's suggestion I have rotated the mode to <strong>M</strong> but I am not able to manually control the exposure or work out how to put the camera into ""bulb"" mode. This is the copy of the manual I'm working from <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/pdf/manuals/dslr/D60_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The manual referenced above states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shutter remains open while the shutter-release button is held down,
  and closes when the  shutter-release button is released. This option
  is available when shooting in d mode at a shutter speed of “Bulb”
  (“bulb”  is displayed in the viewfinder) (A44).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess my question is....how do I set the shutter speed to ""bulb""?</p>
","<p>To set the shutter speed to <em>Bulb</em>, select <strong>M</strong> mode with the mode dial and then rotate the <em>command dial</em> located in the upper right corner on the back of the camera. Each click of the dial will change the shutter speed 1/3 stop. At one end of the scale will be the camera's maximum shutter speed: 1/4000 second. At the other end of the scale will be <em>Bulb</em>, one click past 30 seconds.</p>

<p>In the middle of the bottom there's a rather large semicircle of shadow. Is this caused by the built in flash? If so, how can I avoid it (if I keep using the flash). Interestingly enough, when I shoot portrait instead of landscape, the semicircle doesn't appear.</p>
","<p>The most typical reasoning for this circular obstruction is the use of a <strong>lens hood</strong> that is obstructing the flash. It could also be caused by a rather large <strong>lens itself</strong> getting in the way as well. A similar effect can be found when a wide angle lens is used that is <strong>beyond the coverage</strong> of the flash. </p>

<p>I would consider what lenses you were using, at what focal length, and with or without a lens hood. Adjust the combination of these things and you will resolve this issue. It is of course possible that you will have to remove the lens hood to effectively use the built in flash. Alternatively you could use an external flash mounted on the hot shoe(<a href=""http://amzn.com/B006R6TUJI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yongnuo option</a>), or off camera by using any one of a number of techniques to get the flash further from the lens(this will also improve other aspects of flash beyond resolving this issue).</p>

"How to use a tripod on the beach without damaging it?","8960","","<p>The site already has a good example of what to consider in regards to <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2247/shooting-on-the-beach-is-it-dangerous-for-my-equipment"">camera and lenses around sand</a>, but I specifically am wondering what considerations to make when using a tripod near sand. Many years ago I took a cheap tripod with lever style legs, and sand really wrecked the entire tripod. I am hoping this time to avoid that issue. <strong>Is there a style of tripod that might be better, and how can I use it in such a way to limit any long term damage?</strong></p>

<p>I don't have any specific shots in mind, just likely some long exposure night shots of the beach resort, and I might get it out in the day time for some self portraits.</p>
","<p>In addition to @Itai's answer, I'd like to add, if you don't want to spend 1200$ on a tripod just to protect it from sands, you can use a little care, or on extreme situations, alternative DIY methods.</p>

<p>I also wrecked a tripod (not totally wrecked, but the sands kind of jammed the levers on the legs) by using it near a beach on a windy day. The next time I took some plastic (polythene) bags, cut them into long pieces (3"" width) and adhesive tapes to put them around the leg lever joints like bandages. Worked like a charm. The only problem is, once you tape them in, you lose the ability to adjust the tripod height by extending the legs, otherwise this is good enough if you're not planning to go all out beach shooting. Adjust the tripod height before applying the tapes and you're good to go for that day.</p>

<p>And after the shooting, get to a safe place and use a rocket blower to blow off any accidental remaining sand particles near the lever joints just to be on the safe side. </p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: This method doesn't look pretty.</strong></p>

<p>Additional Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept the fact that a tripod is a tool, it's OK if it gets dirty. Metal tripods will eventually corrode if you expose it to salt water on a regular basis. Get a carbon fiber tripod to prevent corrosion.</li>
<li>Make it a practice to always extend the lowest section to keep the joints out of the sand.</li>
<li>A broad sand ""shoe"" is useful in both sand and mud to keep the leg from sinking.</li>
<li>If the tripod gets dirty, keep it extended until you can clean it.</li>
<li>Any decent quality tripod will take many, many years to corrode to the point it really matters with occasional exposure to sand/salt water. So, open up all the legs, wash and rinse it thoroughly using clean water and wipe it dry before storing it.</li>

","<p>An octabox will give you nice round catchlights and produce generally more natural looking highlights and reflections. The straight edge of a softbox often sticks out when shooting with reflective surfaces more than a more organic curve or circle.</p>

<p>On the other hand softboxes are easier to mask and gobo due to the straight edges, and more suitable to certain technical lighting styles (e.g. for product photography where you want lights parallel to certain surfaces or at an angle to 'feather' the light). They are often cheaper, and easier to set up and tear down.</p>

","<p>The same lens and settings on a full frame will be sharper as you can see in lens comparisons:</p>

<p>You can play around with lenses, settings and cameras on that page and you will notice that FF is (almost) always sharper, despite that the corner is further away from the center than the aps-c shots.</p>

<p>4:3 cameras are slightly smaller than aps-c but they apparently removed the low pass filter making them sharper than aps-c, more similar to fullframe, but full frame still has the noise/DR advantage:</p>

<p>The compression/relative magnification factor is another advantage of full frame. To take good pictures of people you need a real 50-135mm (e.g. primes 50mm, 85mm, or 135mm) lens, not a ""focal converted 50mm"" 28-35mm lens on apsc or 4:3 camera. On the crop sensors even the 50mm lens comes across a bit narrow in your living room, so people tend to go for 28 or 35mm primes on crop sensors, which does give a fov like close to 50mm, but it warps the faces.   </p>

"What historic reasons are there for common aspect ratios?","8920","","<p>The most common width to height ratio rates in the ""old good"" paper photography seems to be 3:2, which was adopted by today's DSLRs. Early (non-professional) digital cameras adopted 4:3 aspect ratio, which was the industry standard for computer monitors and for consumer TV sets. Prints are often 5:4 (as in 4""x5"" or 8""x10""). Wide-format monitors are 16:9. Does anyone have any idea where and why these aspect ratio conventions were adopted in the first place?</p>
","<p>Originally, film formats were arbitrary and specific to each camera model. For example, Kodak started making ""pocket"" cameras in 1895, but each new design used a different format. By 1908, they decided to simplify the confusion with a <a href=""http://bvipirate.com/Kodak/FilmHist.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">numbering scheme</a>, calling that first format ""101"" and continuing the numbering up from there. In fact, the ""120"" medium-format film still in use today is part of this sequence. (""135"" for 35mm film came later, and it appears they skipped ahead to make it match.) 101 happened to be square; 102 was 3:4, 103 and 104 were 4:5 and 5:4; 105 is 9:13, and basically arbitrary weirdness continues down the line. By 1916, Kodak had thirty different lines with a dozen different aspect ratios, all in production.</p>

<p>And of course, it wasn't just Kodak — everyone did their own thing. Eventually, some standards did emerge, but even within those, there's <a href=""http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2010/11/open-mike-film-format.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a whole lot to choose from</a>. Here's some of the more common formats today, and a bit about their histories.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dDDm9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dDDm9.png"" alt=""4:3""></a></p>

<p>4:3 is the most common ratio for compact digital cameras, including point and shoot models. It matches the standard ratio of computer monitors in the 1990s as digital cameras were first developed, and that came from TV, which got it from cinema.</p>

<p>Thomas Edison's lab chose a 4:3 ratio for silent film, and it became the standard. No one knows exactly why this particular ratio was chosen, but there's plenty of <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=oofqv043A3EC&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;ots=ivERJfizmy&amp;dq=4:3%20aspect%20ratio%20film%20Dickson%20peter%20ward&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">speculation</a>. One <a href=""http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/aspect_ratios.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">story</a> suggests that engineer  <a href=""http://www.victorian-cinema.net/dickson"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">William Kennedy-Laurie Dickson</a> asked Thomas Edison what shape he wanted each frame to be, and Edison held his fingers in approximately a 4:3 shape, saying ""about like this"".</p>

<p>When soundtracks were added to motion pictures, the space required changed the standard slightly, but it's still the foundation. That translated to television sets, and then to computer monitors, and therefore was a natural choice for early digital cameras, and of course continues to today.</p>

<p>However arbitrary (or inspired?) Edison and Dickson's choice might have been, there's precedent in visual arts — <a href=""http://blog.wolfram.com/2015/11/18/aspect-ratios-in-art-what-is-better-than-being-golden-being-plastic-rooted-or-just-rational-investigating-aspect-ratios-of-old-vs-modern-paintings/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">analysis</a> of several different datasets generally shows that the most common aspect ratio for paintings is something close to 4:3, with 5:4 also popular.</p>

<p>This is also roughly the proportion of a ""full plate"" (or ""whole plate"") used in Daguerreotypes or tintypes, from before cinema. This format is 6½""×8½"", which is roughly 4:3, give or take the oddness of the half inch. Cutting this various <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141008171808/http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/1_early/1_early_photography_-_sizes.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fractions</a> was also common, and although the resulting sizes were <a href=""http://cwfp.biz/platesizes.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not consistent</a>, the smaller sizes usually stayed to <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=DH9_dGFbekQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20printed%20picture&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">approximately-4:3 aspect ratio</a>.</p>

<p>Wider formats eventually came to cinema largely as a way to distinguish the attraction of theaters from home viewing. See <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=zbCK8ETCWzwC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Academy%20ratio%201:33%20silent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GEhZ1-k-ER&amp;sig=fNUjiq9g-jOeARHA8Q-ReVTdXI4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r63sTrPcFen10gG9veTPCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Academy%20ratio%201:33%20silent&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this for more</a>, or search for ""Academy ratio"" and you'll get lots of information. This comes back around to photography when we get to the 16:9 aspect ratio discussed below.</p>

<p>It's worth observing that 4:3 and 3:2 are geometric cousins, since halving or doubling a 4:3 frame (in the sensible dimension) yields a 3:2 frame, and halving or doubling 3:2 yields 4:3.</p>

<p>110 film, an obsolete cartridge format for mass-consumer-level cameras, uses a 13mm×17mm frame, which is close enough to 3:4 in spirit — although oddly the standard prints are 3½""×5"", or 10:7, a ""weird"" ratio partly between this and 3:2.</p>

<p>(Beware when searching for more on this; there's an oft-repeated article out there full of <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/9213/1943"">unwarranted</a> golden-ratio mysticism.)</p>

<p>Japanese camera makers Nikon and Minolta used a 4:3 format in their <a href=""http://www.nikonweb.com/s2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first 35mm film cameras</a>, but then switched to 3:2 along with everyone else — <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141112010200/http://www.huffman.tk/id52.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">possibly for political reasons</a>, but possibly just for convenience.</p>

<p>When the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Photo_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Advanced Photo System</a> standard was invented, ""APS-C"" was defined to follow this <b>C</b>lassic aspect ratio (in a smaller size). APS also defined APS-P (a 3:1 panorama), which didn't really catch on; and APS-H, which is close to but not exactly 16:9 (but probably chosen for its similarity).</p>

<p>1:1 is, of course, a square. Squares are obvious, and nice to compose in. There's no concern about ""portrait"" or ""landscape"" orientation. The inherent symmetry can be used for strong formal composition. So, conceptually, this is pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>However, it appears that the various non-square rectangles were more common for photography — perhaps following preferences in painting, where off-square rectangles are <a href=""http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2011/03/image-size.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">historically</a> predominant. </p>

<p>Square wasn't really a hit until <a href=""https://photography.tutsplus.com/articles/a-guide-to-producing-beautiful-square-format-images--photo-6615"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rollei's twin-lens cameras came along</a> in 1929.

It seems that despite what appears at first to be obviousness for composition, square photos were first a matter of technical practicality rather than aesthetics.</p>

<p>Also on a technical note, new photographers often wonder why square sensors aren't used to capture more of the image circle projected by camera lenses — after all, a square is the greatest-area rectangle that can fit in a circle. But, it <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/92362/why-arent-square-cmos-sensors-more-popular-by-now/92365#92365"">turns out</a> this is only efficient if you want a square in the end, of course not everyone wants that.</p>

<p>I should mention popular smartphone apps here, too. <a href=""http://hipstamatic.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hipstamatic</a> for the iPhone was the first to take off, and now <a href=""http://instagram.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instagram</a> boasts <a href=""http://instagram.com/press/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">60 million square-format photos</a> <em>per day</em>.

<p>5:4 is a common <em>large format</em> aspect ratio, both as 4""x5"" and 8""×10"", and that's where the popular 8""×10"" print comes from. I'm not sure why exactly it was chosen, but I wouldn't be surprised it simply fits with the historical preferences for almost-square frames as noted above. It certainly goes back to at least the 1850s — see the bit on cartes de visite below.</p>

<p>Mostly, I imagine the history here roughly mirrors the <a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/627/how-did-8-1-2x11-and-8-1-2x14-become-the-standard-paper-sizes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">history of standardized sizes for letter paper</a>.</p>

<p>5:7 is another aspect ratio one commonly sees available for prints and in pre-made picture frames. It was a moderately-popular large-format option which seems to have mostly fallen out of favor, perhaps because it's ""too in-between"" — inconveniently large to enlarge, smaller than people might prefer printed directly. I found a couple of interesting articles on the format (<a href=""http://www.shutterbug.com/content/not-too-big-not-too-small-praise-5x7-format"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.largeformatphotography.info/5x7.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), but I haven't found any particular reason for the <em>aspect ratio</em>; it seems to just have been an acceptable arbitrary choice between the other common sizes of 4""×5"" and 8""×10"". </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RjC7N.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RjC7N.png"" alt=""5:8""></a></p>

<p>Since 8""×10"" can be cut in quarters for 4""×5"", it seems logical that half-sized film would also have been common, and indeed cameras using the 5""×8"" format also exist/existed, but for whatever reason never got to be as popular as 5×7. </p>

<p>This is particularly interesting because 5:8 is a very close approximation of the golden ratio, and maybe this is an argument <em>against</em> people's natural attraction to that. (See <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=QTMZAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA682&amp;ots=eR5iV5pcys&amp;pg=PA682#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this 1891 article</a>, where the author says: <em>""I would recommend the 6½×8½ in preference to the 5×8, since for most work the latter is not so well proportioned.""</em>)</p>

<p>One common format with this aspect ratio was popular in the 1860s — the <a href=""http://photographymuseum.org/histsw.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">carte de visite</a>, a 2.5""×4"" ""business card"". There was a technique for taking <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/20939975@N04/2585761428/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eight such photographs on a single 8""×10"" plate</a>, which explains the aspect ratio choice, although especially given the timing it may well be that the golden ratio played some part. This format, though, was supplanted in a few decades' time by larger 4:3-ratio <a href=""http://www.city-gallery.com/learning/types/cabinet_card/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cabinet cards</a>.</p>

<p>6x7 is a common medium-format film format, but this isn't really the aspect ratio used. Unlike typical large format film, this is measured in metric instead of inches, so 6x7 is actually a smaller format than (for example) 4×5, although that's only tangentially relevant to the aspect ratio discussion. The important thing is that the usable portion of 120-format roll film is 56mm wide, so 70mm gives an 4:5 (8:10) aspect ratio. That means you can create 8""×10"" prints without cropping, and for this reason, this was marketed as ""<a href=""http://www.iscanmanuals.com/paypal/concept.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ideal format</a>"".</p>

<p>There's other <a href=""http://photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/filmformats.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">common ways of dividing up that same roll</a>, giving different aspect ratios, and most of these are already discussed: 6×6 is 1:1 (56mm×56mm frame size), 6×4.5 is 4:3 (56mm×42mm), 6×9 is 3:2 (56mm×84mm). And 6×17 is used for panoramas.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6fh6A.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6fh6A.png"" alt=""16:9""></a></p>

<p>16:9 is the standard for HDTV, of course, and it was simply selected as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16:9#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compromise format</a> by the committee designing that standard. Hooray for committees! <a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-251986.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This forum thread</a> goes into the background of the decision, but really, <em>committee compromise</em> sums it up — it's not ideal for <em>either</em> the classic ratio or common widescreen formats, but sits in the middle — either awkwardly or conveniently, depending on your biases. Many computer monitors, laptop screens, and even phones use this aspect ratio today, and it's no surprise that digital cameras often offer it as an in-camera output choice to match.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how long this one lasts in the grand scheme of things.</p>

","<ol>
<li><p><strong>Perspective and settings</strong> - like Darkcat Studio said.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Direction of the light</strong> - in the second background, the side of the tree branches facing the camera near the couple are in shadow while the couple is lit from the front - you have to choose a background that has the same light direction has the foreground picture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality of the light</strong> - hard light vs. soft light, this was one of the problems with the first background (but a pretty minor one compered to the perspective)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amount of light</strong> - you have to match the lighting of the background and foreground, in your example the couple has way more light on them than the tree just a few inches away (that doesn't mean the background and foreground has to have the same amount of light but you need a realistic ratio)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color of the light</strong> - your background has a very ""cold"" blue light while the couple looks ""warm"" with a lot of red tones - if you have the raw files you can just change the color temperature, if not you can use RGB curves, to warm the photo bump the red channel up a little bit and the channel blue down, to cool do the opposite (but you can only change the color by a tiny amount before they start looking weird, especially with skin tones) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The funny thing is that those also ""work"" if you don't change the background - one of my favorite photos is a picture of my son in front of storm clouds where I exposed for the sky and used a flash to light my son - I have the completely unedited jpeg out of the camera and it looks as fake as your switched background pictures (really, no one believes me this is unedited) because the setting is unusual (when was the last time you've seen a person in front of storm clouds) my son is lit by hard light from the side on an overcast day (where there should have been soft light from above) the light difference between foreground and background isn't natural and the white balance of the flash and overcast sky doesn't match.</p>

<li>focal ratio</li>
<li>...</li>

<p>How can I remove all those metadata for sharing?</p>

<p>I'm particularly looking for solutions for Max OS X. </p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nconvert</a> is a fantastic tool to convert and manipulate images. It is available for a huge number of <a href=""http://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/#downloads"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">platforms</a> in cluding Mac OS X and some plaforms I thought were long gone :)</p>

<p>To wipe all metadata you have to use the rmeta option, as in:</p>

<pre><code>nconvert -rmeta DSCN0001.JPG
</code></pre>

<p>There is a small catch with all such operations depending on your camera. When you take photos in portrait orientation (the long side being vertical), some cameras create a JPEG with the rotated dimensions and others simply flag the jpeg as being rotated. In the latter case, removing all metadata will make all images appear in landscape orientation. nconvert provides an easy fix for this:</p>

<pre><code>nconvert -jpegtrans exif DSCN0001.JPG
</code></pre>

<p>...which you have to do before removing the metadata but you can combine into one operation as in:</p>

<pre><code>nconvert -jpegtrans exif -rmeta DSCN0001.JPG
</code></pre>

<p>PS: If you use Lightroom to export your images before publication and enable the option <em>Minimize embdeded metadata</em>, your images will be correctly oriented and stripped of metadata except for copyright information which is something you may want to keep embedded anyways.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I always like when people want to use <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/pie4dan/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my photos</a>, but I don't allow commercial use without permission. I license them under the Creative Commons <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BY-NC-SA license</a>.<br>
If it's clearly a commercial project they want to use the photo for, I feel like I should be paid.</p>

<p>I never quite know what's a good way to respond.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you explain why you think you should be compensated or do you just say that they can purchase it for a certain amount of money?</li>
<li>What's a good price to ask (I guess that's really hard to answer, but a minimum price for example, would be really handy to know)?</li>
<li>Do you publicly list your prices somewhere, so people can find out themselves without asking you?</li>
<li>Is it realistic at all to think people are willing to pay for photos?</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to sell my photo and I don't want to turn someone down right away with completely unrealistic prices and the like. However, if they are not willing to compensate me at all, I am ok with them not using my photo.</p>
","<p>You absolutely should be paid. And not only that, you absolutely have the right to protect your work. There are dangers associated with offering ""free use"" of your work, as once you do, you can never really tell how far your work may be distributed ""for free"". The company you license it to may turn around and license another company to create some design with it. Once its out ""in the corporate wild"", you could lose control of it entirely.</p>

<p>As for ""not having a budget"", doubtful. I worked for a company that did a lot of graphic design for a couple years. I hated the company as they practiced ethically and morally borderline and often out right wrong practices on an all too frequent basis. One of their tactics was to search for photography online and when they found something they liked, they would send out a sob-story email like the one you got. They leeched more work off of more desperate and unaware photographers than I could count. Whenever they couldn't get something for free, they would either offer money, or find something not free and pay for it. They certainly had a budget for such things, and a large one at that.</p>

<p>Your work is you. It's your style. It's an expression of you. It should require compensation for use. Don't let the snide, underhanded tactics of a greedy corporation leave you without control of your art or the compensation you deserve. Ask for reasonable compensation, and make sure you supply a proper commercial use license to limit how far they can ""internally distribute"" you work, so you don't lose control over who actually has what rights to it. </p>

<p>So, to your specific points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simply ask that they pay for its use, and be clear, in writing with a proper license, about what ""use"" means. Don't give them freedom to use it as they please. Make sure they use it only for the specific case they need it for right now. Make them pay you again for additional use for different purposes. Alternatively, ask for a LOT of money for the right to use it as they please for as long as they please (Perpetual, limitless.)</p></li>
<li><p>""How much"" is pretty subjective. Its something you could determine based on the company and their intended usage. You could simply put together a standard price list for your work and various usage scenarios. Factor in your effort, how much value you would give the photo yourself, and how much use the company expects to get. If they only expect to use it in one specific case for one specific thing that may have a limited timeframe of existence, you might ask for a lower price. If they expect perpetual usage rights without limitation, and/or the right to license its use to someone else who may use it in work done for the company, you should ask for much more. Perpetual usage is the holy grail of usage rights...it really shouldn't come cheap. How ""cheap"" or ""expensive"" depends on how you think your work compares to top notch professional work. You'd probably need to do some research to figure out where your work might fit on a ""pricing scale"". If you have never sold anything before and think you might have a hard time selling it at what you would consider a fair price, consider lowering your prices a bit until you have an established reputation.</p></li>
<li><p>Entirely up to you. Depends on how you want to sell your work, either on a case-by-case basis, or as a key part of your professional work as a photographer. If the purpose of your photography is to provide high quality stock photos for fixed prices for specific terms of usage, you probably want to create a web site that has examples of your work and your price list. One thing to note...NOT having a price list is often beneficial, as you can negotiate price on a sale by sale basis. Some companies may be willing to pay more, some are going to be rather stingy. If you are just starting out, you might find a lot of value in keeping your prices fluid and learn what the sweet spot is that sells the most work at the highest possible price. Once you have established an average, you'll be better equipped to produce a readily available price list.</p></li>
<li><p>Absolutely. The amount you might get for photography today is subjective, and less than it was a number of years ago, which was itself significantly less than a number of years before that (before the age of ubiquitous, cheap digital stock and oppressive bullies like Getty Images and co.) A few years from now you may find that its harder to get as good a price as you might want today. Sadly, the state of affairs with for-pay photography is there are too many cheap photographers who just want a microsecond of fame and recognition, and are all too willing to give their work up for free. That has put some severe downward pressure on prices for photographic work. You can probably reverse that trend for your own work if you establish yourself as someone who produces very high quality photography worthy of the price. However yes...it is realistic to think that people and companies will pay for photography these days.</p></li>

"What is white or black ""clipping"", and how does one avoid it?","8882","","<p>I have been told that this photograph has ""<strong>white clippings</strong>""?<br>
What are they, and which light sources should be placed in what way to avoid that?  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iejb7.jpg"" alt=""Sample image I&#39;m told has clipped highlights""></p>
","<p>Clipping is a term that basically refers to data loss in a captured image. Another common description for this phenomenon is referring to part of an image as 'blown out'. The light streaming into your camera hits the pixels on your camera senor and is turned into a tiny amount of electric charge. Each element can only hold so much charge so when its full the highlight is fully saturated and when a whole area of pixels are saturated, any detail in that area is lost, referred to as clipped or blown. Similarly there has to be a sufficient amount of light hitting the pixel to generate any measurable charge and if there is not enough in an area of the sensor only a solid black is captured and any detail in that area is similarly lost. No amount of post processing can bring detail back in these areas because no detail at all has been captured. </p>

<p>With a film camera the same thing happens except that instead of the light being turned into an electric charge on a sensor it causes photosensitive molecules on the film to react. When they have all reacted in an area of the negative no detail can be captured in that area.</p>

<p>In compositions where there are both very bright and very dark areas such as your example it is very challenging to capture detail across the whole image. Techniques such as HDR were developed exactly for this scenario where several images at different exposures are combined to increase dynamic range. It is impossible to capture detail across the whole image with a single shot without employing some external lighting to illuminate the darker areas so you can lower the exposure an bring the lighter areas in. Professional photographers tend to make good use of reflectors to do this just to lift the shadows enough to get some depth.</p>

"How do I find a point-and-shoot camera specifically for bokeh / a very shallow depth of field?","8840","","<p>I will be getting a point-and-shoot camera for taking portraits and only portraits.  Specifically portraits with a shallow depth of field.   Groups portraits sometimes.  It's just too much work to add lens blur at post-prod.  I understand that setting a P&amp;S on macro mode gives a shallow focus and DOF.  </p>

<p>How do I read P&amp;S camera specs to shortlist those with the shallowest depth of field? </p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> By point-and-shoot, I mean a camera that is easy to use -- Not necessarily compact, inexpensive, or current.</p>

<p>Also, if there are two or three factors/specs to get a shallow depth of field, then <strong>which spec</strong> contributes the most to bokeh? which is second most contributing? the third, etc.?</p>
","<p>I think you'll be best served by a large-sensor compact camera, often called a ""mirrorless"", EVIL, or SLD. A smaller sensor <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10079/can-a-smaller-sensors-crop-factor-be-used-to-calculate-the-exact-increase-in-d"">impacts depth of field</a>. A typical high-end P&amp;S like the Canon G12 has what's called a ""1/1.7"" sensor. This is approximately ¹/₃rd the width of an APS-C sized sensor, which means that the depth of field wide open at f/2.8 is equivalent to about f/8 on a larger sensor. (Assuming the same framing and same-sized prints.) The Olympus XZ-1 does a little better, with a faster f/1.8 lens and a slightly larger sensor, but even then, the wide-open depth of field is equivalent to f/6 on an APS-C camera.</p>

<p>So, there's this relatively new category of cameras with large sensors but no reflex mirror as in an SLR — they've got a point-and-shoot-like rear LCD, and sometimes a smaller viewfinder LCD as well. Some of these aim to basically be smaller alternatives to SLRs, but many models also aim at the P&amp;S market — focusing on simplicity and ease of use over sophisticated control.</p>

<p>Recent models which fall in the ""simplicity"" category would be the Sony NEX-C3 and Panasonic DMC GF3. There's also models from Olympus and Samsung. The Sony and Samsung models have APS-C sensors, same as entry/midlevel DSLRs. Panasonic and Olympus use somewhat-smaller ""micro 4/3rds"" sensors (which are still much bigger than those in a typical P&amp;S).</p>

<p>These cameras also offer interchangeable lenses, so you could get a <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/news/1106/11062008panaleicasamplesgallery.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nice, fast prime</a> to match. This shouldn't be overlooked, because the <em>quality</em> of bokeh is dependent on the lens design, and there's a lot more to it than aperture and sensor size.</p>

<p>Oh, and I should add: one feature that's pretty much vital for your use case is a proper Aperture Priority mode — usually <code>Av</code> or <code>A</code> on the dial (but not to be confused with A for Auto!). You'll probably want to use so that the camera computes exposure automatically but can be instructed to use a given wide aperture for shallow depth of field.</p>

<p>I want to align the photos manually since auto align doesn't align them properly.</p>
","<p>The only way you can manually align photos using Photoshop's built in merge to HDR function is to load the images as layers, align them, trim so they are the same size and then save each layer as a separate file and then run the Merge to HDR option, making sure ""attempt to automatically align photos"" is not selected.</p>

<p>There's no way to merge to HDR images that are in memory, the function only works on files. You may get slightly different results using saved (converted) images than Raw files, I don't know how merge to HDR works internally.</p>

<p>You can get rid of most of it in Lightroom/Camera Raw.  Move the blacks/shadows sliders to the left.  The fireworks are so bright they'll be at the other end of the histogram and largely unaffected.  You could do this with levels or curves.  </p>

<p>At that point, your sky will be very black, so you can paint/mask out remaining smoke pretty easily</p>

<p>It's possible to select the fireworks, create a mask and feather it, but you'll probably lose some detail.  So I'd just reduce the brightness of the smoke with curves or ACR</p>

</blockquote>



<p>First question on this forum, I just bought today a Nikon D7000 NEW from B&amp;H today for stop motion photography. Problem is when I take a shot, all I get are SOLID black images. The view finder is unobstructed, and I'm able to focus manually and automatically but the images I take are all black. Even when I use the camera in DragonFrame the I get a clear live view shot, where I'm able to manipulate the image/focus etc, but the second I take the shot even in 3rd party software, I get a black image?!</p>
","<p>If you are doing time-lapse or stop-motion, you will want all your exposure to match, which is why I believe DragonFrame is recommending you use M (manual mode).  In manual mode, the camera will not make decisions about shutter speed and aperture, so you can ""fix"" the exposure by using manual mode.  With all the other modes, the camera will adjust either shutter speed, aperture or ISO, or a combination of the three, to obtain a suitable exposure.  Not so with manual mode, it will just use what aperture, shutter speed and ISO are set on the camera.</p>

<p>So in manual mode you'll need to adjust the shutter speed and aperture yourself, using the command dial on the right side of the camera.  If the image is too dark, you'll need to open up the aperture (a smaller f-number, say f/2.8 or f/4) and/or decrease the shutter speed - if 1/125th is producing dark images, try 1/30th or 1/4.  </p>

<p>You can see the aperture, ISO and shutter speed in the viewfinder.  There is also an Info button that will display the same information in the LCD display.</p>

<p>There is a full discussion of using Manual mode here:  <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/9625/how-do-i-know-i-have-the-correct-exposure-when-shooting-in-manual-mode/9634#9634"">How do I know I have the correct exposure when shooting in manual mode?</a></p>

"What are the different kind of light modifiers and their uses?","8786","","<p>Particularly with an emphasis on studio setups and portraits, what are the different kind of light modifiers (softboxes, umbrellas, etc) and what are they used for?   </p>

<p>For bonus points, what kinds of household items, if any, can be easily substituted (if even on a small scale)?</p>

<p>EDIT: So, apparently this was broader than I realize (I knew I was casting a wide net, but I think I underestimated the knowledge and <em>gumption</em> of our community).  I wouldn't hold it against anybody to just hit some <em>major</em> ones.</p>
","<p>Wow, this is an extremely broad question, as there are dozens of light modifiers, but I'll cover the most important ones for strobe lights.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, light modifiers are all about <strong>controlling light</strong>. Whatever you decide to do with, you want to keep a reign on it. As such, we can split modifiers into two main groups: soft and hard modifiers.</p>

<p><strong>Soft modifiers</strong></p>

<p>Modifiers that soften light generally work by diffusing it - spreading it out over a large surface so that light rays are scattered. They are used anywhere you want to reduce shadows and make things look smoother. Their number one use is for key lights in people photography.</p>

<p>The most popular of these modifiers are umbrellas and softboxes.</p>

<p>Umbrellas include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.scottkelby.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/shoothrusm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shoot through umbrellas</a> - these are semi-transparent umbrellas that you place in front of your light source. They work just like putting a lampshade over a lamp's bare bulb, you place them between the subject and the strobe. Imagine that they ""filter"" the light like a sieve.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.alzodigital.com/images/equipment/umbrella_silver_black_backed_600w.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reflective umbrellas</a> - these are opaque, black outside and are usually silver, gold or white inside. These are placed open-side to the subject, with the strobe pointed away from them, straight into the umbrella. The inside reflects the light, scattering it in every direction. The various liner materials determine the color and quality of the light being reflected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Umbrellas come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny ones to ones over 3 meters across, and are easily the most popular modifier you will find. Their main advantages are their small size, low price and versatility - you can shoot with a folded reflective umbrella for a very specific light quality. Their biggest disadvantage is a lack of control they give over light spills.</p>

<p>There is really no home-brew solution for umbrellas. They are extremely cheap (&lt; $10), which is about as much as a real umbrella you would have to hack up costs. </p>

<p>Softboxes include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQw5tXbRBKdtgN-kkrO7h4kc637DPhBzXvs_1gJ3waCB0cmtIhelA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Softboxes</a> - these are usually pyramid-shaped constructions, lined with a silver material, with room for a strobe at the top of the pyramid and diffusion cloth at the base. They come in almost all dimensions, from tiny inflatable(!) ones for speedlights, to huge, studio-only setups that require multiple light stands to hold. Their biggest advantage is their ability to control light spill and to accept modifiers. They are heavier, bulkier (even folded down), more expensive and take longer to set up than umbrellas. </li>
<li><a href=""http://kaffebrus.com/manualer-p24.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Octas</a> - there are two versions of the octa: either as a softbox with a octagonal shape, or as a hybrid softbox-umbrella, which is what I'll be writing about here. A strobe is placed inside something akin to a deep umbrella, then diffusing cloth is placed behind it. In practice, this creates extremely soft light as light is first scattered off the reflective material inside the ""umbrella"", then diffused again by the cloth. With large octas it's difficult to support the entire modifier off the front of the strobe, so some manufacturers (Elinchrom, Profoto, etc) have octas that mount on the light stand and allow you to place the strobe inside it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Softboxes are what most people think of when they think of studio photography, so they make a good impression if someone's coming to pose for you. Using additional modifiers, like a grid, flag or filter on top of your softbox can give you even more control.</p>

<p>The key in softboxes is diffusion, you don't need to literally make a softbox, you can throw a bedsheet over a broomstick supported by two chairs and you'll make yourself an excellent, soft light source. You can literally make a <a href=""http://www.dphotojournal.com/images/tips/diy-softbox.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">soft box</a> by lining a cardboard box with aluminum foil and pulling a sheet over it, but the comedic effect while shooting portraits might be a bit too much.</p>

<p><strong>Hard modifiers</strong></p>

<p>Hard light is the default with strobes - that's what we get when we fire off a speedlite or on-camera flash. A small point of light that brings out imperfections and coarse textures. Shoot it from the side and it'll make a child look like they have awful skin. Still, it's extremely useful to have controlled beams of light (think: rimlights/hairlights) and it's absolutely critical in product photography.</p>

<p>There are four basic types of hard modifiers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.photoflex.com/Pro_Products/Strobe_Flash_Lighting/Accessories/StarFlash_sup__reg___sup__7_inch_Reflector/1154552875_main6reflector.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reflectors</a> - these are the standard bowl-shaped accessory that pretty much every studio strobe sold today ships with. Their only use is to cut down light spill to the sides when using a bare bulb (which is rarely done) and when using umbrellas or grids. </li>
<li><a href=""http://img3.prosperent.com/images/250x250/site.unbeatablesale.com/img071/bi1277.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grids</a> - these are literally metal grids of various thickness and density. The black tubes they form work extremely well to stop scattered light rays coming from the strobe bulb, creating a thin, relatively soft beam of light. The quality of light is determined by the density of the grid, while the size of the beam (expressed in degrees) is determined by the thickness of the grid. Grids often also include gates, which are movable flaps on each side of the grid which allows for finer, tighter beam control. </li>
<li><a href=""http://multiply.com/mu/mawnum/image/1/photos/8/500x500/19/snoot-accessoire-studio-photo.jpg?et=WbxMl5PJaPB7xTOrTXu%2CYQ&amp;nmid=365419218"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Snoot</a> - a very simple construction, this is usually just a slightly tapered tube of black metal. It creates a very harsh, small beam of light.</li>
<li><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_a2DXd3J5wHw/TAssHzvx75I/AAAAAAAAM68/Cawv8tbpnQ0/s1600/beauty_dish_Med_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beauty dish</a> - this is the most complex and - in my opinion - nicest of the hard modifiers. A small reflector (usually silver, gold or white) is placed in front of the strobe, while a bowl-shaped reflector is placed around the strobe. This creates a very even, hard light with an extremely sharp drop-off. Used almost exclusively in people photography, it's extremely useful as a key light, especially for people with good, smooth skin (or makeup). As the name implies, it is extremely popular in beauty photography. </li>
</ul>

<p>As far as DIY solutions, Strobist has a huge <a href=""http://strobist.blogspot.com/search/label/DIY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DIY section</a>, but be warned: a lot of the store-bought stuff is a lot sturdier and gives better results than the DIY equivalents. You can fake a snoot on a speedlight using a cardboard tube painted black on the inside, but past that... just get the chinese knock-off. Again, instead of recreating these modifiers in a home setting, look at what they do with the light and try to emulate that. A single soft light source as a key, a big piece of white paper as a reflector will give you very nice results. You can always cut up the paper, replace part of it with aluminium foil, put a flag between your model's eyes and the light source, etc. The possibilities are endless. </p>

<p><strong>General observations</strong></p>

<p>Remember, light is just light, most of these modifiers can be (and are!) mixed and matched: grids on snoots, diffusion material on beauty dishes, grids on softboxes (these are almost always cloth), silver backs for shoot through umbrellas, etc. There are also tons of different names for everything I've listed above, I just used the ones I'm most common with.</p>

<p>Three critical components of studio work that I didn't cover as they aren't strictly light modifiers, but are worth talking over: flags, scrimms and bounces. </p>

<ul>
<li>Flags - anything that's not a light modifier that blocks light. Professional flags tend to be black cloth or paper stretched on a frame that has a small handle protruding to make it easier to place on a stand. At home you can use pieces of black paper and just tape them where they need to go, or maybe black cloth if you need to stop a white wall from reflecting. Used mainly to control light spill and keep down highlights.</li>
<li><a href=""http://static.photo.net/attachments/bboard/00F/00FOp5-28415384.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scrims</a> - these are panels covered in diffusing cloth, placed where light needs softened locally. You know those outdoor TV scenes where it's a bright, sunny day, yet all the actors are lit by nice, soft light? That's a huge scrim over their heads. At home, just use a piece of white cloth, you're good to go.</li>
<li>Bounces - also known as bounce cards. Literally, anything that will reflect enough light to be useful, but usually opaque white, silver or gold material stretched out on a frame, but you you'll often see mirrors used for this. Usually used in contra to a key light as a way of lightening (or opening up) shadows created by the light. The type of material determines the light's quality, the distance from the subject and light determines the bounced light's intensity. </li>
</ul>

<p>That should cover it, I'll update if anything else comes to mind.</p>

But they also list <em>Optical transmission wireless flash shooting</em> despite the fact that the 5DmkIV doesn't have the built-in flash that would be necessary for optically triggering an off-camera Speedlite. I can see how it might be confusing that they list both those features even though the optical and radio triggers aren't built in, but notice that they're listed under the heading <em>External Flash Settings</em>; like other recent EOS bodies, the 5DmkIV can control many of the settings of compatible flash units through the camera's menu system, including which trigger system you want to use.</p>

"What is Lead Room?","8761","","<p>Continuing to educate about basic compositional techniques,</p>

<ol>
<li>What is ""Lead Room?""</li>
<li>Why is it important to consider Lead Room when taking pictures?</li>
<li>When do I apply it to my photography?</li>
</ol>
","<h3>What is Lead Room?</h3>

<p>Lead Room (also variously referred to as leading, nose room, or leading space) is a foundational compositional technique that is frequently employed in the visual arts such as cinematography, painting, and of course photography. In essence the 'rule' of lead room is that when framing a subject, well composed shots will include 'white space' in the direction that a subject is facing, or in the case of moving objects, in front of the direction that an object is moving.</p>

<h3>Why is lead room important?</h3>

<p>Lead room is an important compositional technique to keep in mind even if you're deciding to <em>break</em> the guideline and not give a photo lead room because altering the lead room has the potential to alter the mood or 'feeling' of a photograph. For example, in this portrait lead room has been given in the direction the model's body is facing and as a result the portrait feels open and relaxed.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TAsi2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>But if we take the same exact picture and shift the model to the other side of the frame, all of a sudden it feels as though the model is cramped within the frame.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kptvs.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The effects of lead room can be even more pronounced when the subject of a photograph is in motion. In the following image the airplane has a sense of moving through the frame from left to right because it appears that it has room to move... </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GwdA7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Whereas when the same photograph is cropped so the photograph's white space is behind the airplane all of a sudden there seems to be something missing. There's a sense of motion that has been removed because there doesn't appear to be anywhere for the plane to go!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8AIA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h3>How do I apply lead room to my photography</h3>

<p>Like most things in photography, this is not a 'hard-and-fast' rule... more accurately this is a rule of thumb. Generally speaking, lead room can be applied to living subjects (e.g. humans, animals, etc.), and objects in motion. Inanimate objects that aren't in motion can't really benefit from using lead room. But it is important to understand the effects on a images perception that lead room can have as you compose your pictures in order to take advantage of (or negate the advantage of) this rule of thumb. </p>

"How do soft focus or defocus control rings work?","8747","","<p>Lenses like <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/1935/AF-DC-NIKKOR-135mm-f%252F2D.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one from Nikon</a> have a ""defocus control"" feature which allows you to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Control the degree of spherical aberration in background or foreground elements for more creative control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do these lenses work? The defocus control has settings measured in f-stops; is it some sort of translucent aperture?</p>
","<p>A soft focus lens is one that offers a photographer control over <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spherical aberration</a></strong>, an optical effect caused by a spherical lens (which most camera lens elements are) such that light rays entering the lens near the edges are focused more tightly than light rays entering near the center. The result of spherical aberration is that the plan of focus is <em>curved</em>, rather than flat.</p>

<p>Modern lenses often try to correct spherical aberration with aspherical lens elements or other advanced optics. A <em>soft focus</em> lens is a lens designed to not only keep spherical aberration, but allow the photographer to control the form of the out-of-focus blur circles created by the aperture. <em>Defocus control</em> is exactly what it sounds like, a way to control the way your lens ""defocuses"" light. This is in addition to the ability to <strong>also</strong> control the focal plane. <strike>The specific mechanics of how a soft focus/defocus ring works is unknown to me, however it could be implemented by a slightly movable diaphragm. It may also involve adjustable or movable special lens elements. (I have been unable to find any information on the subject, and the exact mechanics of it currently escape me.)</strike></p>

<p>UPDATE: Found a PDF that describes the defocus control mechanism <a href=""http://kenrockwell.com/nikon/images1/135mm-dc/patent-5841590.pdf?vid=USPAT5841590"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> Summary:</p>

<p>By adjusting ""defocus"", can control the shape of out of focus bokeh:</p>

<p>In the image above (from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spherical-aberration-disk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>), you can see the effect of spherical aberration. The top row demonstrates a point light source that has negative spherical aberration, or blur circles with darker edges and brighter centers behind the focal plane and brighter edges and darker centers in front of the focal plane. The center row represents balanced spherical aberration, where focus in front and behind the focal plane is even. The third row represents positive spherical aberration, where blur circles with brighter edges and darker centers occur behind the focal plane, and darker edges and brighter centers in front of the focal plane.</p>

<p>With a defocus ring, you can choose how your camera ""defocuses"", in addition to choosing how it focuses. You can make the bokeh in the background clear, sharp circles with bright rings, and the bokeh in the foreground smooth and soft like photonic butter. Or you can choose the inverse, whichever fits your fancy. With a thin enough focal plane, a soft focus lens can create amazing images like this:</p>

<p>The above image was taken with the Nikkor 135mm f/2 lens with defocus control, set to REAR f/4. Note the dreamy effect of highlights right around the plane of focus, and the ringed background bokeh. Both are effects of positive spherical aberration caused by the brighter edges and darker centers of OOF blur circles. Foreground blur will be smooth and creamy without the dreamy effect. For portraits, the same effect can be used to give that dreamy glow to hair, earrings or glasses, anything that produces a bright specular highlight.</p>

"Is noise related to shutter speed as well as ISO?","8743","","<p>I understand that as I increase ISO, I'll increase the amount of noise in the resulting image.  With a constant aperture I can decrease ISO and slow the shutter speed (assume a non-moving subject, camera on a tripod etc, so shutter speed won't introduce any blur).  My question is, will the image noise of a high ISO/fast shutter speed be the same as a low ISO/slow shutter speed where both settings provide the same total amount of exposure?</p>

<p>I'm looking for answers that pertain to modern DSLR's, not film, in case it makes a difference.</p>
","<p>Image noise in a properly operating DSLR will be affected by shutter speed, but not in the linear relationship the question implies. In decreasing order of impact, image noise is a factor of:<br>
 - Amplification applied to the sensor cells (higher ISO increases noise)<br>
 - Thermal noise (hotter sensor is noisier)<br>
 - Duration of exposure (longer the capture, more the cumulative random pixels lit up) </p>

<p>Duration related noise is also interrelated with thermal noise, since keeping the sensor powered for longer will cause more heat to be generated.</p>

<p>Overall, in a given shooting environment, <strong>increasing ISO has the greatest detrimental effect</strong>, going by empirical evidence from a fair bit of night photography done using a Canon 1D Mark III, Canon 5D Mark II, and a couple of non-SLRs, a Minolta DiMAGE A2 and DiMAGE A200.</p>

<p>Summer evening shots also seem to have greater visible noise (I see more random red dots than other colors, oddly) than cold winter evening shots.</p>

"Why is my camera limited to a shutter speed of 1/250th when the flash is up?","8732","","<p>Sometimes in bright backlight and with large aperture (f2.8) I want flash at high shutter speeds.  But when I pop the flash up on D7000 it caps the shutter speed to 1/250th, which overexposes the shots and makes everything look like a nuclear bomb just went off.</p>

<p>What's the logic behind the limiting of the shutter speed when using flash? Is there anything I can do to get flash  + faster shutter speeds?</p>
","<p>The limitation has to do with synchronizing the length of the exposure with the length of the flash burst. The flash does not go off immediately...it occurs a fraction of a moment after the shutter has opened, and the burst only lasts a fraction of the time the shutter is open. This is necessary to produce a proper exposure when using a full-powered flash due to the way the shutter itself works. The maximum shutter speed that can be achieved at is 1/200th or 1/250th of a second most of the time. With more precise logic and shutter timing, you can achieve 1/500th of a second flash sync, however thats more difficult (and therefor expensive) to do, which is why its relegated to only top of the line pro-grade cameras. This ensures that the front shutter curtain is fully open before the flash pulse is set off, and that it stays open long enough for the effects of flash to properly light the scene and allow correct exposure before the second curtain closes. </p>

<p>There is also an alternative approach to flash, called high-speed flash sync. This allows flash to be used at any shutter speed. The difference between high speed flash sync and normal flash sync is that at shutter speeds above about 1/500th of a second, the second curtain starts to close before the first curtain is fully open...a shutter ""gap"" transitions across the sensor. High speed flash sync uses a lower-powered flash pulse set off multiple times in rapid succession to ensure that the scene is properly lit for each part of the sensor as that shutter gap moves across it. High speed flash sync is generally not as good as standard flash, and in most cases it should not be needed...but in a pinch it can do the job.</p>

"What are the effects of umbrella size?","8688","","<p>I keep seeing shoot thru an reflecting umbrellas in sizes around 33"", 36"", 42"" and even larger. Many of the kits (stand, clamp, umbrella) I see around have the smaller size umbrellas. Strobist.com also suggests a 42"". </p>

<p>What differences could I expect between the different size umbrellas and how might their usage / flexibility compare? Would I expect more light fall off with a larger umbrella?</p>
","<p>Are you planning to shoot indoors or outdoors? Umbrellas are difficult to use outdoors as they act like a sail and it only takes a slight breeze to send your umbrella - and flashgun crashing down. You either need a serious stand weighted down, or someone holding the umbrella. Even so I'd go with the smaller size for shooting outdoor.</p>

<p>A larger umbrella gives a softer light - at the same distance. However it's a apparent size of the lightsource as seen from the subject that defines the softness/hardness (hence the character of the light). e.g. the sun and moon have the same apparent size, viewed from the Earth. The sun is much bigger, but at the same time further away.</p>

<p>Therefore a 33"" umbrella at a distance of 2 meters should act very similar to a 42"" umbrella at 2.5 meters. However:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You will receive less light from the further away brolly (i.e. bigger brollies need more powerful flashes in general). Likewise you need a bigger stand etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Having the light further away makes it easier to control flare (by ensuring the lightsource is not in frame) and gives the subject more room to move.</p></li>
<li><p>A further away lightsource gives more even lighting. Again taking the sun as an example the near and far sides of a 1 meter object are effectively at the same distance from the sun and receive the same amount of light. However if you place a lightsource 1m from the object then the far side is double the distance from the near side and receives 1/4 the light.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the difference between 33"" and 42"" is not that great, and 42"" isn't that big in the scheme of things, so unless I was putting together a kit that was designed to be ultra mobile I'd go for the 42"".</p>

"What is crop factor and how does it relate to focal length?","8661","","<p>I'm reading that a 50mm lens is recommended as a first prime lens for DSLR owners as it's supposed to give a 'natural' perspective, but when used on (most) DSLRs, the view is cropped, as if you were zoomed in by 1.5-1.6x, so it's more of a telephoto lens when used on a DSLR. I've also read however that the 50mm lens gives the same perspective on a DSLR and a 35mm, and shouldn't really be considered to be 'equivalent' to an 80mm lens as the crop factor isn't really a magic focal length changer.</p>

<p>Can someone explain how the image is different from (for example) a 50mm lens on a DSLR and an 80mm lens (assuming 1.6x crop factor) on a 35mm camera?</p>
","<p>You can find detailed definition of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Crop Factor in Wikipedia</a> there is also a good explanation on dpreview site where it is referred to as <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/Glossary/Optical/Focal_Length_Multiplier_01.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Focal Length Multiplier""</a></p>

<p>In short in your scenario if you have one full frame camera (crop factor 1) with 80mm lens and a second camera with 1.6 crop factor and 50mm when taking photos from the same position you will get the same frames  (80 x 1 = 50x1.6 = 80)</p>

<p>That does not mean however that the photos will be identical. The depth of field for example if shooting with the same aperture will be different as it is still dependent on the (actual) focal length of the lens, that is the reason why people who are interested in achieving shallow depth of field tend to use full frame cameras. </p>

<p>Also the camera with crop factor 1.6 has a smaller sensor (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see crop factor definition</a>) - so assuming the both have same resolution say 10 Mega Pixels, and use the same technology the full frame camera will have bigger pixels, each would capture more light and that would usually translate into better high iso performance and better dynamic range.</p>

"Why do Full Frame lenses and crop body lenses exhibit the same crop factor when used on a crop body camera?","8660","","<p>I have a Canon 7D, which has a crop factor of 1.6x.</p>

<p>When using a Canon EF-S lens I get the focal length stated on the lens, when using a Canon EF lens I get the focal length times 1.6 when used on the APS-C body. <em>At least that's what I thought</em>.</p>

<p>I just compared two lenses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canon EF-S 15-85mm f3.5-5.6</li>
<li>Canon EF 70-200mm f4</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/O2JGg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I took the same photo as you can see here</a>.</p>

<p>The top photo is shot with the 15-85, the bottom photo with the 70-200 - <strong>both lenses are set to 70mm</strong>. Now why do they look the same?</p>

<p>I thought I would get 112-320mm (70mm*1.6 crop factor). What did I misunderstand about the crop factor calculation? Lightroom also displays the photos as having ""70mm"" and not 112mm.</p>
","<p>Whether a lens is an EF or an EF-S lens, the actual focal length is always used. There are certain technical reasons why this is so, but the simplest is that a lens' focal length is defined as the distance from the film plane needed when the lens is focused at infinity to cast point light sources as a single point on the film plane. This doesn't change with regard to sensor size. What does change with regard to sensor size is the angle of view or <em>field of view (FoV)</em> that a lens of a specific focal length will include in the part of the image circle that falls on the sensor.</p>

<p>What this means is that if you are using a 70mm lens on a Full Frame camera, the FoV will be about 34° diagonally. The same 70mm lens on a crop sensor body will have an FoV of about 21°. That is an equivalent FoV of about a 110mm lens on the FF body, and that is why camera manufacturers say that the 70mm lens on a crop body is a 110mm <em>equivalent</em>. If you print photos taken of the same subject from the same distance using the same focal length lens with both cameras on the same size paper, the image from the crop sensor camera will make the subject appear larger. This is because the ratio between the crop sensor size and the print size is greater than the ratio between the larger full frame sensor and the same print size, thus the <em>magnification factor</em> of the photo taken with the crop sensor body is higher.</p>

<p>If you take both images shot at 70mm on your 7D with an EF 70-200mm f/4L and an EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS they will have the same FoV because both lenses are set at 70mm. To understand the 35mm equivalent FoV they yield, <strong><em>both</em> lenses need to be multiplied by the crop factor</strong>, even though one of the lenses does not project a light circle large enough to fill a full frame sensor.</p>

"Does shooting video decrease the life of a DSLR more than taking photos?","8650","","<p>I have read several posts here saying that one of the first things that breaks down on a DSLR is the shutter mechanism (because it is mechanical)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I do not care about the connection of video and shutter use. My question is simple. When I buy a used camera should I take into account whether it has seen heavy video use or not?
Or it does not matter at all?</p>

<p>Let's say that I find a Canon 700d with 2.000 clicks and 100000000 hours of video use, and a Canon 700d with 50.000 clicks and no video use at all. Both have the same price. Which one should I take?</p>
","<p>I think there is some urban myths regarding this, and that this has to do with the CCD/CMOS debate some time ago. CCD sensors really heated up so much that they cannot record video. The technology then switched to CMOS, that can support video seamlessly, and not heating that much.</p>

<p>Obviously, having the sensor to be working for hours taking video instead for fractions of a second taking photos is a difference, but sensor frabrication process has taken this into account. You may end up with dead pixels and such, but they also come up spontaneously, so I wouldn't worry much about video/non-video usage.</p>

","<p><strong>The short answer is: use a long shutter speed.</strong>  To control this, put your camera into Shutter Priority mode (indicated by a ""S"" on the dial"" and adjust the speed to a relatively long time - perhaps a half a second, a whole second, or perhaps longer.</p>

<p><strong>The longer answer for when it gets tricky:</strong> You might find that during the daytime, things are so bright that when you set a long shutter speed, even at the camera's smaller aperture (biggest f/ number) you end up with blown-out highlights or overexposure.  In these cases, make sure that you're using the lowest ISO possible.  If that's not good enough, you might need to look at a neutral density filter, which is a filter that limits the amount of light coming into the camera.  These are often used for longer daytime exposures such as those seen with silky waterfall photos.</p>

","<p>Sticking with your requirements of around 12mm or so focal length, rectilinear, autofocus and less than around $400, the simple answer to this is ""no, you can't have that"" even if you're prepared to compromise on other things like speed, optical quality and (lack of) zoom. If you're prepared to give up on autofocus (which generally isn't too much of a problem for ultra-wide lenses because the hyperfocal distance is only a couple of metres), there are a couple of options from Samyang/Rokinon:</p>

","<p>The biggest operational difference is that version II has a super-rotator style design that allows the tilt and shift axis to be varied at any point relative to each other. Version I allowed the tilt and shift axes to be either aligned or set at 90 degrees to each other, and changing between the two settings required partially dismantling the lens! With version II there's just a knob to control the relative angles of tilt and shift.</p>

<p>The other main difference is the optics, version one of the 24mm tilt shift is 22 years old now and the new version was designed for digital and features a more sophisticated design (16 elements vs 11), with  modern coatings which bring a host of optical improvements. Extreme corners feature much improved contrast and sharpness, with less lateral chromatic aberration.</p>

<p>Alongside corner improvements the image circle is significantly larger (67.2mm compared to 58.6mm) allowing greater shifts and reduced vignetting. Maximum tilt is increased marginally to 8.5 degrees from 8. There is also a switch on the lens to lock tilt in the neutral position if you only want to shift.</p>

<p>You'll notice the differences if you do a lot of shifts. If you're mostly using the tilt function then version I is a good buy, though you might want to consider the Samyang 24mm tilt-shift which is a similar price but offers a super-rotator design. Performance is pretty bad wide open, but if you intend on using the lens to extend depth of field then it may perform better than the old Canon in the corners at f/8.</p>

<p>If you have the 10-30 mm lens, I'd set it to 30 mm, you'll need to move the camera a little further away from the subject but the subject will fill more of the picture (this depends on the lens, experiment, don't assume that macro means getting the lens as close as possible to the subject).</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>Using any sort of tripod or camera support (even improvised) will help a lot, use the timer to set a delayed release.</p>

<h2>Depth of focus</h2>

<p>If some parts of the object are not in focus, I'd select ""single-area"" focus mode and position the focus area on the most important element of the object. If necessary set exposure mode to P or A and adjust the aperture settings by using the zoom lever so that the camera is using a smaller aperture (try F8 or F16 and compare results).</p>

"Which is the better lens: Canon 28-105 or 28-135?","8585","","<p>I have a very old (18 years or so) Canon 28-105 3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I bought it for my Elan 2e and then 7NE, and then used it on my XTI.  I thought it took great pictures.</p>

<p>Now i'm shooting the Canon Kit 28-135 3.5 -5.6 USM IS lens on a Canon 7d.</p>

<p>The 28-135 has greater range - but is a significantly bigger, heavier, and more cumbersome lens.  the 28-105 is the same speed at 105, so i'm curious is there's any benefit to using it, especially since it isn't IS.</p>

<p>Which is the better lens for everyday shooting?</p>
","<p>At the longer end of the focal length, the IS is going to make a huge difference for any free-shooting.  Also, optics have taken pretty significant steps forward in the past 20 years, so chances are good that a newer lens will produce a better image, but it's also hard to determine the exact trade off since longer focal length ranges tend to sacrifice image quality as well.</p>

<p>My guess would be that the newer IS lens will generally give you better performance, but the best bet would be to take a look at the total image distortion charts for both lenses to see which is cleaner.</p>

<p>Edit: Apparently, both lenses are old.  The 28-135 is from 1998, so it doesn't have a lot of the more recent benefits.  I couldn't find any details of the I variant of your older lens, but the II variant had better f/stops through significant portions of the range.  I would suggest doing some more comparisons and see how the lens actually performs, but the 28-105 may actually be better.</p>

<p>But how do I compare these two? Is there any way to convert guide numbers to watt-seconds?</p>
","<p>No, there is no way to convert guide numbers to watt-seconds. Watt-seconds is a measurement of how much energy is used by the flash, not how much light is put out. A significant portion of this energy is wasted as heat, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.</p>

<p>A 4 watt-second flash that is 100% efficient will put out the same amount of light as a 400 watt-second flash that is 1% efficient.</p>

<p><a href=""http://light-studio./blogspot.com/2007/10/watt-seconds-vs-effective-watt-seconds.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Effective watt-seconds"" are ill-defined as well</a>, so are basically just as useless as watt-seconds. </p>

They can be directly compared at a given beam spread (assuming manufacturers aren't stretching a bit. <a href=""http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/sb600.htm#perf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ken Rockwell seems to think most flashes are over-rated by about a stop</a>.)</p>

<p>However, the most accurate way to compare two flashes is through an actual scientifically defined unit like the lumen-second. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lumen (symbol: lm) is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the power of light perceived by the human eye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As photographers, we're all keenly aware that time plays an important role in exposure. The longer the shutter is open, or the longer the light is on, the higher the exposure. Thus, lumen-seconds more directly translate to exposure than lumens do.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""http://www.alienbees.com/specs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">page from AlienBees' website</a> which includes the specs on your B400 (7000 lumen-seconds) as well as a paragraph or two about how bogus ""effective watt-seconds"" are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Effective Wattseconds rating, however, is rather arbitrary and cannot be easily proven true or untrue, as it is merely used as a basis for inflated comparison of different flash systems.</p>

"How much additional light does an f2.8 really let in?","8551","","<p>I currently have the Nikon 18-55mm kit lens that came with my D3100, but I am looking for something that will let more light in among the entire focal range. I have been eyeing the Tamron 17-50mm f2.8 as a potential option, but I am wanting to clear up just a few concerns:</p>

<p>1) I have heard the Nikon kit lenses are actually pretty decent in terms of sharpness, contrast, optical distortion, etc. How does this compare to the Tamron lens in question? I am buying the lens to get a higher f-stop but I don't want to do that at the expense of quality.</p>

<p>2) Since I have only shot with kit lenses, it is difficult for me to quantify just how much extra light will be let in with a f2.8 (compared with f3.5 on my kit lens). My goal is to take sharper indoor/low-light photos without the aid of flash or too much ISO. What is the real world differences between these f-stops?</p>
","<p>The Tamron is known to be optically very good and sharp wide open across the frame. I know semi pro Nikon users who use that one on a crop camera for e.g. wedding shots. The F number on your kit number is only F3.5 on the widest and if you go into Av and keep an eye on it, you see it drops very quickly to F5-5.6. The range 2.8 - 4 is a stop (double the shutter time - F3.5 vs 2.8 is a factor 1.56) and 4-5.6 is another stop (quadruple the shutter time). </p>

<p>Now the thing is that the longer the focal length the shorter the shutter needs to be so it is working against itself. at 18 you can do fine with 1/27s, maybe 1/40s to be sure, while at 50mm you need 1/75s minimum or 1/125 to be sure. </p>

<p>Another problem is that if you get serious and try to control the composition including depth of field, ambient/flash light ratio, exposure manually, you have to worry about zooming just a bit as it might change your balance. </p>

<p>Also if you have a filter on that makes everything darker, a Fx-5.6 lens will go darker than F5.6 for most part of your zoom range, disabling the AF which doesnt work under F5.6.</p>

<p>So this is all the trouble you are relieved of in a fixed aperture lens.</p>

<p>If your most important objective is sharp indoor photos without flash, you might need to sacrifice the convenience of zooming, and go straight for F1.4 or F1.8 primes. That's 1-2 stops faster yet from the F2.8. A F1.4 50mm is 16 times faster than your kit lens. When I shoot indoor  in normal living room light I already have to use Iso 800 or 1600 depending on the light and whether I use 28mm, 50mm or 85mm. I do stop it down a bit to F2.2 to improve sharpness a bit and get a bit more focus in DOF and that gives a fast enough shutter (1/50s - 1/150s).</p>

","<p>A polarizer can make some reflections disappear or, if rotated 90 degrees, it can make the reflections stronger. In general, transparent materials, like window glass, water and even air, affect the polarization of reflections, but metallic reflectors do not. So, in answer to your questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Depending on rotation of the filter, it can increase or decrease the ""wet look"".</li>
<li>It depends on the filter orientation if glass reflections are eliminated or exaggerated.</li>
<li>It should not change the shape of lights.</li>
<li>A good, clean filter should not create much extra glare or flare on lights.</li>
<li>It can remove glare from still water, but is less effective on ripples. </li>
<li>It can darken and intensify the color of the sky at 90 degrees from the sun on a clear day. At night, it might have the same effect for moonlit scenes.</li>

Also what are the different settings for, Auto and +1 to +5?</p>
","<p>DRO stands for Dynamic Range Optimization. It is designed to fit more dynamic range into images. A single exposure is still taken so you are always limited to the sensor's latitude. However, from what the sensor captures, more or less of that range is mapped into images. With fixed values, the transform is applied the same to each image. With <em>Auto</em>, it depends on feedback from the metering system and the mapping from sensor dynamic-range to images will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>DRO is one of the few settings which indirectly impacts RAW files. While its designed as processing, which normally effects JPEG and TIFF files only, the camera adjusts exposure to have more dynamic range available for the mapping, often reducing exposure to get more details in highlights. If you shoot RAW and Manual mode though, DRO will have no effect.</p>

Which one is a better practice, or is it the photographer's discretion?</p>
","<p>Either can be the right answer, depending on circumstances.  There is no one right or even usually right answer.</p>

<p>Moving in will change the relative perspective of objects.  Things that are a little closer will appear disproportionately bigger, whereas from further back this size difference due to distance difference is reduced.  A great example is getting close to someone's face, which causes the subject's nose to appear unusually large.  Other times, that perspective difference is exactly what you want.</p>

<p>Zooming in has the advantage that it can be done from the same spot, and you don't actually have to get close to the subject.  A obvious circumstance where this is important is when taking pictures of wild animals.  They will run off or fly off, or in some cases try to eat you if you get too close.</p>

<p>Moving in allows a shorter focal length to be used, which allows for a slower shutter speed at the same level of blur due to camera wobble, like when hand holding.  Moving too far in may not work with your lens.  All lenses have minimum focus distances.  If you really need to get up close, then you want a macro lens, extension tubes, closeup lenses, or a reverse mount.</p>
